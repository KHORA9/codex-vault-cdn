I\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLONDON: JOHN LANE, THE BODLEY HEAD\r\nNEW YORK: JOHN LANE COMPANY: MCMIX\r\n\r\n_Copyright in U.S.A., 1908, by_\r\nMANZI, JOYANT ET CIE\r\n\r\n_Copyright in U.S.A., 1908, by_\r\nJOHN LANE COMPANY\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY PRESS, CAMBRIDGE, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joan of Arc]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE ENGLISH EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nScholars have been good enough to notice this book; and the majority\r\nhave treated it very kindly, doubtless because they have perceived\r\nthat the author has observed all the established rules of historical\r\nresearch and accuracy. Their kindness has touched me. I am especially\r\ngrateful to MM. Gabriel Monod, Solomon Reinach and Germain\r\nLefevre-Pontalis, who have discovered in this work certain errors,\r\nwhich will not be found in the present edition.\r\n\r\nMy English critics have a special claim to my gratitude. To the memory\r\nof Joan of Arc they consecrate a pious zeal which is almost an\r\nexpiatory worship. Mr. Andrew Lang's praiseworthy scruples with regard\r\nto my references have caused me to correct some and to add several.\r\n\r\nThe hagiographers alone are openly hostile. They reproach me, not with\r\nmy manner of explaining the facts, but with having explained them at\r\nall. And the more my explanations are clear, natural, rational and\r\nderived from the most authoritative sources, the more these\r\nexplanations displease them. They would wish the history of Joan of\r\nArc to remain mysterious and entirely supernatural. I have restored\r\nthe Maid to life and to humanity. That is my crime. And these zealous\r\ninquisitors, so intent on condemning my work, have failed to discover\r\ntherein any grave fault, any flagrant inexactness. Their severity has\r\nhad to content itself with a few inadvertences and with a few\r\nprinter's errors. What flatterers could better have gratified \"the\r\nproud weakness of my heart?\"[1]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _January, 1909_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"_De mon coeur l'orgueilleuse faiblesse_,\" Racine,\r\n_Iphigenie en Aulide_, Act i, sc. i.--(W.S.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first duty should be to make known the authorities for this\r\nhistory. But L'Averdy, Buchon, J. Quicherat, Vallet de Viriville,\r\nSimeon Luce, Boucher de Molandon, MM. Robillard de Beaurepaire, Lanery\r\nd'Arc, Henri Jadart, Alexandre Sorel, Germain Lefevre-Pontalis, L.\r\nJarry, and many other scholars have published and expounded various\r\ndocuments for the life of Joan of Arc. I refer my readers to their\r\nworks which in themselves constitute a voluminous literature,[2] and\r\nwithout entering on any new examination of these documents, I will\r\nmerely indicate rapidly and generally the reasons for the use I have\r\nchosen to make of them. They are: first, the trial which resulted in\r\nher condemnation; second, the chronicles; third, the trial for her\r\nrehabilitation; fourth, letters, deeds, and other papers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Le P.

Her cross-examination cannot be\r\ntoo minutely studied. It is based on information, not preserved\r\nelsewhere, gathered from Domremy and the various parts of France\r\nthrough which she passed. It is hardly necessary to say that all the\r\njudges of 1431 sought to discover in Jeanne was idolatry, heresy,\r\nsorcery and other crimes against the Church. Inclined as they were,\r\nhowever, to discern evil in every one of the acts and in each of the\r\nwords of one whom they desired to ruin, so that they might dishonour\r\nher king, they examined all available information concerning her life.\r\nThe high value to be set upon the Maid's replies is well known; they\r\nare heroically sincere, and for the most part perfectly lucid.\r\nNevertheless they must not all be interpreted literally. Jeanne, who\r\nnever regarded either the bishop or the promoter as her judge, was not\r\nso simple as to tell them the whole truth. It was very frank of her to\r\nwarn them that they would not know all.[4] That her memory was\r\ncuriously defective must also be admitted. I am aware that the clerk\r\nof the court was astonished that after a fortnight she should remember\r\nexactly the answers she had given in her cross-examination.[5] That\r\nmay be possible, although she did not always say the same thing. It is\r\nnone the less certain that after the lapse of a year she retained but\r\nan indistinct recollection of some of the important acts of her life.\r\nFinally, her constant hallucinations generally rendered her incapable\r\nof distinguishing between the true and the false.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Jules Quicherat, _Proces de condamnation et de\r\nrehabilitation de Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 8vo, 1841, vol. i. (Called\r\nhereafter _Trial_.--W.S.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 93, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 89, 142, 161, 176, 178, 201.]\r\n\r\nThe record of the trial is followed by an examination of Jeanne's\r\nsayings in _articulo mortis_.[6] This examination is not signed by the\r\nclerks of the court. Hence from a legal point of view the record is\r\nout of order; nevertheless, regarded as a historical document, its\r\nauthenticity cannot be doubted. In my opinion the actual occurrences\r\ncannot have widely differed from what is related in this unofficial\r\nreport. It tells of Jeanne's second recantation, and of this\r\nrecantation there can be no question, for Jeanne received the\r\ncommunion before her death. The veracity of this document was never\r\nassailed,[7] even by those who during the rehabilitation trial pointed\r\nout its irregularity.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 478 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Cf._ J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux sur l'histoire de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 1880, pp. 138-144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Evidence of G. Manchon, _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, the chroniclers of the period, both French and Burgundian,\r\nwere paid chroniclers, one of whom was attached to every great baron.\r\nTringant says that his master did not expend any money in order to\r\nobtain mention in the chronicles,[9] and that therefore he is omitted\r\nfrom them. The earliest chronicle in which the Maid occurs is that of\r\nPerceval de Cagny, who was in the service of the house of Alencon and\r\nDuke John's master of the house.[10] It was drawn up in the year 1436,\r\nthat is, only six years after Jeanne's death. But it was not written\r\nby him. According to his own confession he had \"not half the sense,\r\nmemory, or ability necessary for putting this, or even a matter of\r\nless than half its importance, down in writing.\"[11] This chronicle is\r\nthe work of a painstaking clerk. One is not surprised to find a\r\nchronicler in the pay of the house of Alencon representing the\r\ndifferences concerning the Maid, which arose between the Sire de la\r\nTremouille and the Duke of Alencon, in a light most unfavourable to\r\nthe King. But from a scribe, supposed to be writing at the dictation\r\nof a retainer of Duke John, one would have expected a less inaccurate\r\nand a less vague account of the feats of arms accomplished by the Maid\r\nin company with him whom she called her fair duke. Although this\r\nchronicle was written at a time when no one dreamed that the sentence\r\nof 1431 would ever be revoked, the Maid is regarded as employing\r\nsupernatural means, and her acts are stripped of all verisimilitude by\r\nbeing recorded in the manner of a hagiography. Further, that portion\r\nof the chronicle attributed to Perceval de Cagny, which deals with the\r\nMaid, is brief, consisting of twenty-seven chapters of a few lines\r\neach. Quicherat is of opinion that it is the best chronicle of Jeanne\r\nd'Arc[12] existing, and the others may indeed be even more worthless.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Ne donnoit point d'argent pour soy faire mettre es\r\ncroniques._--Jean de Bueil, _Le Jouvencel_, ed. C. Fabre and L.\r\nLecestre, Paris, 1887, 8vo, vol. ii, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Perceval de Cagny, _Chroniques_, published by H.\r\nMoranville, Paris, 1902, 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Le sens, memoire, ne l'abillite de savoir faire metre\r\npar escript ce, ne autre chose mendre de plus de la moitie_, Perceval\r\nde Cagny, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 1.]\r\n\r\nGilles le Bouvier,[13] king at arms of the province of Berry, who was\r\nforty-three in 1429, is somewhat more judicious than Perceval de\r\nCagny; and, in spite of some confusion of dates, he is better\r\ninformed of military proceedings. But his story is of too summary a\r\nnature to tell us much.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Ibid._, pp. 40-50. D. Godefroy, _Histoire de Charles\r\nVII_, Paris, 1661, fol. pp. 369-474.]\r\n\r\nJean Chartier,[14] precentor of Saint-Denys, held the office of\r\nchronicler of France in 1449. Two hundred years later he would have\r\nbeen described as historiographer royal. His office may be divined\r\nfrom the manner in which he relates Jeanne's death. After having said\r\nthat she had been long imprisoned by the order of John of Luxembourg,\r\nhe adds: \"The said Luxembourg sold her to the English, who took her to\r\nRouen, where she was harshly treated; in so much that after long\r\ndelay, they had her publicly burnt in that town of Rouen, without a\r\ntrial, of their own tyrannical will, which was cruelly done, seeing\r\nthe life and the rule she lived, for every week she confessed and\r\nreceived the body of Our Lord, as beseemeth a good catholic.\"[15] When\r\nJean Chartier says that the English burned her without trial, he means\r\napparently that the Bailie of Rouen did not pronounce sentence.\r\nConcerning the ecclesiastical trial and the two accusations of lapse\r\nand relapse he says not a word; and it is the English whom he accuses\r\nof having burnt a good Catholic without a trial. This example proves\r\nhow seriously the condemnation of 1431 embarrassed the government of\r\nKing Charles. But what can be thought of a historian who suppresses\r\nJeanne's trial because he finds it inconvenient? Jean Chartier was\r\nextremely weak-minded and trivial; he seems to believe in the magic of\r\nCatherine's sword and in Jeanne's loss of power when she broke it;[16]\r\nhe records the most puerile of fables. Nevertheless it is interesting\r\nto note that the official chronicler of the Kings of France, writing\r\nabout 1450, ascribes to the Maid an important share in the delivery of\r\nOrleans, in the conquest of fortresses on the Loire and in the victory\r\nof Patay, that he relates how the King formed the army at Gien \"by the\r\ncounsel of the said maid,\"[17] and that he expressly states that\r\nJeanne caused[18] the coronation and consecration. Such was certainly\r\nthe opinion which prevailed at the Court of Charles VII. All that we\r\nhave to discover is whether that opinion was sincere and reasonable or\r\nwhether the King of France may not have deemed it to his advantage to\r\nowe his kingdom to the Maid. She was held a heretic by the heads of\r\nthe Church Universal, but in France her memory was honoured, rather,\r\nhowever, by the lower orders than by the princes of the blood and the\r\nleaders of the army. The services of the latter the King was not\r\ndesirous to extol after the revolt of 1440. During this\r\n_Praguerie_,[19] the Duke of Bourbon, the Count of Vendome, the Duke\r\nof Alencon, whom the Maid called her fair duke, and even the cautious\r\nCount Dunois had been seen joining hands with the plunderers and\r\nmaking war on the sovereign with an ardour they had never shown in\r\nfighting against the English.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Jean Chartier, _Chronique de Charles VII, roi de\r\nFrance_, ed. Vallet de Viriville, Paris, 1858, 3 vols., 18mo.\r\n(_Bibliotheque Elzevirienne_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Lequel Luxembourg la vendit aux Angloix, qui la\r\nmenerent a Rouen, ou elle fut durement traictee; et tellement que,\r\napres grant dillacion de temps, sans procez, maiz de leur voulente\r\nindeue, la firent ardoir en icelle ville de Rouen publiquement ... qui\r\nfut bien inhumainement fait, veu la vie et gouvernement dont elle\r\nvivoit, car elle se confessoit et recepvoit par chacune sepmaine le\r\ncorps de Nostre Seigneur, comme bonne catholique._--Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique de Charles VII, roi de France_, vol. i, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Jean Chartier, _Chronique de Charles VII, roi de\r\nFrance_, vol. i, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Par l'admonestement de ladite Pucelle_, Jean Chartier,\r\nvol. i, p. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Fut cause_, _ibid._, vol. i, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: This revolt of the French nobles was so named because\r\nvarious risings of a similar nature had taken place in the city of\r\nPrague.--W.S.]\r\n\r\n\"Le Journal du Siege\"[20] was doubtless kept in 1428 and 1429; but the\r\nedition that has come down to us dates from 1467.[21] What relates to\r\nJeanne before her coming to Orleans is interpolated; and the\r\ninterpolator was so unskilful as to date Jeanne's arrival at Chinon in\r\nthe month of February, while it took place on March 6, and to assign\r\nThursday, March 10, as the date of the departure from Blois, which did\r\nnot occur until the end of April. The diary from April 28 to May 7 is\r\nless inaccurate in its chronology, and the errors in dates which do\r\noccur may be attributed to the copyist. But the facts to which these\r\ndates are assigned, occasionally in disagreement with financial\r\nrecords and often tinged with the miraculous, testify to an advanced\r\nstage of Jeanne's legend. For example, one cannot possibly attribute\r\nto a witness of the siege the error made by the scribe concerning the\r\nfall of the Bridge of Les Tourelles.[22] What is said on page 97 of P.\r\nCharpentier's and C. Cuissart's edition concerning the relations of\r\nthe inhabitants and the men-at-arms seems out of place, and may very\r\nlikely have been inserted there to efface the memory of the grave\r\ndissensions which had occurred during the last week. From the 8th of\r\nMay the diary ceases to be a diary; it becomes a series of extracts\r\nborrowed from Chartier, from Berry, and from the rehabilitation\r\ntrial. The episode of the big fat Englishman slain by Messire Jean de\r\nMontesclere at the Siege of Jargeau is obviously taken from the\r\nevidence of Jean d'Aulon in 1446; and even this plagiarism is\r\ninaccurate, since Jean d'Aulon expressly says he was slain at the\r\nBattle of Les Augustins.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Journal du siege d'Orleans_ (1428-1429), ed. P.\r\nCharpentier and C. Cuissart, Orleans, 1896, 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The oldest copy extant is dated 1472 (MS. fr. 14665).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Journal du siege d'Orleans_ (1428-1429), p. 87.\r\n_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 162, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Journal du siege_, p. 97. _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 215.]\r\n\r\nThe chronicle entitled _La Chronique de la Pucelle_,[24] as if it were\r\nthe chief chronicle of the heroine, is taken from a history entitled\r\n_Geste des nobles Francois_, going back as far as Priam of Troy. But\r\nthe extract was not made until the original had been changed and added\r\nto. This was done after 1467. Even if it were proved that _La\r\nChronique de la Pucelle_ is the work of Cousinot, shut up in Orleans\r\nduring the siege, or even of two Cousinots, uncle and nephew according\r\nto some, father and son according to others, it would remain none the\r\nless true that this chronicle is largely copied from Jean Chartier,\r\nthe _Journal du Siege_ and the rehabilitation trial. Whoever the\r\nauthor may have been, this work reflects no great credit upon him: no\r\nvery high praise can be given to a fabricator of tales, who, without\r\nappearing in the slightest degree aware of the fact, tells the same\r\nstories twice over, introducing each time different and contradictory\r\ncircumstances. _La Chronique de la Pucelle_ ends abruptly with the\r\nKing's return to Berry after his defeat before Paris.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, or _Chronique de Cousinot_,\r\ned. Vallet de Viriville, Paris, 1859, 16mo. (_Bibliotheque\r\nGauloise_).]\r\n\r\n_Le Mystere du siege_[25] must be classed with the chronicles. It is\r\nin fact a rhymed chronicle in dialogue, and it would be extremely\r\ninteresting for its antiquity alone were it possible to do what some\r\nhave attempted and to assign to it the date 1435. The editors, and\r\nfollowing them several scholars, have believed it possible to identify\r\nthis poem of 20,529 lines with a _certain mistaire_[26] played on the\r\nsixth anniversary of the delivery of the city. They have drawn their\r\nconclusions from the following circumstances: the Marechal de Rais,\r\nwho delighted to organise magnificent farces and mysteries, was in\r\nDuke Charles's city expending vast sums[27] there from September,\r\n1434, till August, 1435; in 1439 the city purchased out of its\r\nmunicipal funds \"a standard and a banner, which had belonged to\r\nMonseigneur de Reys and had been used by him to represent the manner\r\nof the storming of Les Tourelles and their capture from the\r\nEnglish.\"[28] From such a statement it is impossible to prove that in\r\n1435 or in 1439, on May 8, there was acted a play having the Siege for\r\nits subject and the Maid for its heroine. If, however, we take \"the\r\nmanner of the storming of Les Tourelles\" to mean a mystery rather than\r\na pageant or some other form of entertainment, and if we consider the\r\n_certain mistaire_ of 1435 as indicating a representation of that\r\nsiege which had been laid and raised by the English, we shall thus\r\narrive at a mystery of the siege. But even then we must examine\r\nwhether it be that mystery the text of which has come down to us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Mystere du Siege d'Orleans_, first published by MM. F.\r\nGuessard and E. de Certain, Paris, 1862, 4to, according to the only\r\nmanuscript, which is preserved in the Vatican Library.--_Cf._ _Etude\r\nsur le mystere du siege d'Orleans_, by H. Tivier, Paris, 1868, 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 309.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The Abbe E. Bossard and de Maulde, _Gilles de Rais,\r\nMarechal de France, dit Barbe-Bleue_ (1404-1440), 2nd edition, Paris,\r\n1886, 8vo, pp. 94-113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Un estandart et banniere qui furent a Monseigneur de\r\nReys pour faire la maniere de l'assault comment les Tourelles furent\r\nprinses sur les Anglois Mistere du siege_, p. viii.]\r\n\r\nAmong the one hundred and forty speaking personages in this work is\r\nthe Marechal de Rais. Hence it has been concluded that the mystery was\r\nwritten and acted before the lawsuit ended by that sentence to which\r\neffect was given above the Nantes Bridge, on October 20, 1440. How,\r\nindeed, it has been asked, after so ignominious a death could the\r\nvampire of Machecoul have been represented to the people of Orleans as\r\nfighting for their deliverance? How could the Maid and Blue Beard be\r\nassociated in a heroic action? It is hard to answer such a question,\r\nbecause we cannot possibly tell how much of that kind of thing could\r\nbe tolerated by the barbarism of those rude old times. Perhaps our\r\ntext itself, if properly examined, will be found to contain internal\r\nevidence as to whether it is of an earlier or later date than 1440.\r\n\r\nThe bastard of Orleans was created Count of Dunois on July 14,\r\n1439.[29] The lines of the mystery, in which he is called by this\r\ntitle, cannot therefore be anterior to that date. They are numerous,\r\nand, by a singularity which has never been explained, are all in the\r\nfirst third of the book. When Dunois reappears later he is the Bastard\r\nagain. From this fact the editors of 1862 concluded that five thousand\r\nlines were prefixed to the primitive text subsequently, although they\r\nin no way differ from the rest, either in language, style, or prosody.\r\nBut may the rest of the poem be assigned to 1435 or 1439?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Mistere du siege_, preface, p. x.]\r\n\r\nThat is not my opinion. In the lines 12093 and 12094 the Maid tells\r\nTalbot he will die by the hand of the King's men. This prophecy must\r\nhave been made after the event: it is an obvious allusion to the\r\nnoble captain's end, and these lines must have been written after\r\n1453.\r\n\r\nSix years after the siege no clerk of Orleans would have thought of\r\ntravestying Jeanne as a lady of noble birth.\r\n\r\nIn line 10199 and the following of the \"_Mistere du Siege_\" the Maid\r\nreplies to the first President of the Parlement of Poitiers when he\r\nquestions her concerning her family:\r\n\r\n     \"As for my father's mansion, it is in the Bar country; and\r\n     he is of gentle birth and rank right noble, a good Frenchman\r\n     and a loyal.\"[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30:\r\n\r\n    Quant est de l'ostel de mon pere,\r\n      Il est en pays de Barois;\r\n    Gentilhomme et de noble afaire\r\n    Honneste et loyal Francois.\r\n\r\n_Mistere du siege_, pp. 397-398.]\r\n\r\nBefore a clerk would write thus, Jeanne's family must have been long\r\nennobled and the first generation must have died out, which happened\r\nin 1469; there must have come into existence that numerous family of\r\nthe Du Lys, whose ridiculous pretensions had to be humoured. Not\r\ncontent with deriving their descent from their aunt, the Du Lys\r\ninsisted on connecting the good peasant Jacquot d'Arc with the old\r\nnobility of Bar.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Jeanne's reference to \"her father's mansion\"\r\nconflicts with other scenes in the same mystery, this lengthy work\r\nwould appear to be all of a piece.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently compiled during the reign of Louis XI, by a citizen\r\nof Orleans who was a fair master of his subject. It would be\r\ninteresting to make a more detailed study of his authorities than has\r\nbeen done hitherto. This poet seems to have known a _Journal du siege_\r\nvery different from the one we possess.\r\n\r\nWas his mystery acted during the last thirty years of the century at\r\nthe festival instituted to commemorate the taking of Les Tourelles?\r\nThe subject, the style, and the spirit are all in harmony with such an\r\noccasion. But it is curious that a poem composed to celebrate the\r\ndeliverance of Orleans on May 8 should assign that deliverance to May\r\n9. And yet this is what the author of the mystery does when he puts\r\nthe following lines into the mouth of the Maid:\r\n\r\n     \"Remember how Orleans was delivered in the year one thousand\r\n     four hundred and twenty-nine, and forget not also that of\r\n     May it was the ninth day.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31:\r\n\r\n    ... Ayez en souvenance....\r\n    Comment Orleans eult delivrance....\r\n    L'an mil iiijc xxix;\r\n    Faites en memoire tous dis;\r\n    Des jours de may ce fut le neuf.\r\n\r\n_Mistere du siege_, lines 14375-14381, p. 559.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief chroniclers on the French side who have written of\r\nthe Maid. Others who came later or who have only dealt with certain\r\nepisodes in her life, need not be quoted here; their testimony will be\r\nbest examined when we come to that of the facts in detail. Placing on\r\none side any information to be obtained from _La Chronique de\r\nl'etablissement de la fete_,[32] from _La Relation_[33] of the Clerk\r\nof La Rochelle and other contemporary documents, we are now in a\r\nposition to realise that if we depended on the French chroniclers for\r\nour knowledge of Jeanne d'Arc we should know just as much about her as\r\nwe know of Sakya Muni.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 285 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Relation inedite sur Jeanne d'Arc, extraite du livre\r\nnoir de l'hotel de ville de La Rochelle_, ed.

They, however, furnish certain useful information. The\r\nearliest of these Burgundian chroniclers is a clerk of Picardy, the\r\nauthor of an anonymous chronicle, called _La Chronique des\r\nCordeliers_,[34] because the only copy of it comes from a house of the\r\nCordeliers at Paris. It is a history of the world from the creation to\r\nthe year 1431. M. Pierre Champion[35] has proved that Monstrelet made\r\nuse of it. This clerk of Picardy knew divers matters, and was\r\nacquainted with sundry state documents. But facts and dates he\r\ncuriously confuses. His knowledge of the Maid's military career is\r\nderived from a French and a popular source. A certain credence has\r\nbeen attached to his story of the leap from Beaurevoir; but his\r\naccount if accurate destroys the idea that Jeanne threw herself from\r\nthe top of the keep in a fit of frenzy or despair.[36] And it does not\r\nagree with what Jeanne said herself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Bibl.

He\r\nhas but a word to say of her indecision at Montepilloy, but that word,\r\nto be found nowhere else, is extremely significant. He saw her in the\r\ncamp at Compiegne; but unfortunately he either did not realise or did\r\nnot wish to say what impression she made upon him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Enguerrand de Monstrelet, _Chronique_, ed.

Moreover he was\r\nvery ill-informed, which is regrettable. For the man stands alone in\r\nhis day for energy of feeling and language, for passion of wrath and\r\nof pity, and for intense sympathy with the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_ (1405-1449), ed. A.\r\nTuetey, Paris, 1881, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nI must mention a document which is neither French nor Burgundian, but\r\nItalian. I refer to the _Chronique d'Antonio Morosini_, published and\r\nannotated with admirable erudition by M. Germain Lefevre-Pontalis.\r\nThis chronicle, or to be more precise, the letters it contains, are\r\nvery valuable to the historian, but not on account of the veracity of\r\nthe deeds here attributed to the Maid, which on the contrary are all\r\nimaginary and fabulous. In the _Chronique de Morosini_,[44] every\r\nsingle fact concerning Jeanne is presented in a wrong character and in\r\na false light. And yet Morosini's correspondents are men of business,\r\nthoughtful, subtle Venetians. These letters reveal how there were\r\nbeing circulated throughout Christendom a whole multitude of\r\nfictitious stories, imitated some from the Romances of Chivalry,\r\nothers from the Golden Legend, concerning that _Demoiselle_ as she is\r\ncalled, at once famous and unknown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Chronique d'Antonio Morosini_, ed. Leon Dorez and\r\nGermain Lefevre-Pontalis, Paris, 1900-1902, 4 vols. in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nAnother document, the diary of a German merchant, one Eberhard de\r\nWindecke,[45] a conscientious and clever edition of which has also\r\nbeen published by M. Germain Lefevre-Pontalis, presents the same\r\nphenomenon. Nothing here related of the Maid is even probable. As soon\r\nas she appears a whole cycle of popular stories grow up round her\r\nname. Eberhard obviously delights to relate them. Thus we learn from\r\nthese good foreign merchants that at no period of her existence was\r\nJeanne known otherwise than by fables, and that if she moved\r\nmultitudes it was by the spreading abroad of countless legends which\r\nsprang up wherever she passed and made way before her. And indeed,\r\nthere is much food for thought in that dazzling obscurity, which from\r\nthe very first enwrapped the Maid, in those radiant clouds of myth,\r\nwhich, while concealing her, rendered her all the more imposing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _Les sources allemandes de\r\nl'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc_, Eberhard Windecke, Paris, 1903, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThirdly, with its memoranda, its consultations, and its one hundred\r\nand forty depositions, furnished by one hundred and twenty-three\r\ndeponents, the rehabilitation trial forms a very valuable collection\r\nof documents.[46] M. Lanery d'Arc has done well to publish in their\r\nentirety the memoranda of the doctors as well as the treatise of the\r\nArchbishop of Embrun, the propositions of Master Heinrich von Gorcum\r\nand the _Sibylla Francica_.[47] From the trial of 1431 we learn what\r\ntheologians on the English side thought of the Maid. But were it not\r\nfor the consultations of Theodore de Leliis and of Paul Pontanus and\r\nthe opinions included in the later trial we should not know how she\r\nwas regarded by the doctors of Italy and France. It is important to\r\nascertain what were the views held by the whole Church concerning a\r\ndamsel condemned during her lifetime, when the English were in power,\r\nand rehabilitated after her death when the French were victorious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Trial_, vols. ii to iii, 1844-1845 (vols. v and vi,\r\n1846-1847, contain the evidence).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, 1889, in 8vo. _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 411-468.]\r\n\r\nDoubtless many matters were elucidated by the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three witnesses heard at Domremy, at Vaucouleurs, at Toul, at\r\nOrleans, at Paris, at Rouen, at Lyon, witnesses drawn from all ranks\r\nof life--churchmen, princes, captains, burghers, peasants, artisans.\r\nBut we are bound to admit that they come far short of satisfying our\r\ncuriosity, and for several reasons. First, because they replied to a\r\nlist of questions drawn up with the object of establishing a certain\r\nnumber of facts within the scope of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The\r\nHoly Inquisitor who conducted the trial was curious, but his curiosity\r\nwas not ours. This is the first reason for the insufficiency of the\r\nevidence from our point of view.[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 378-463.]\r\n\r\nBut there are other reasons. Most of the witnesses appear excessively\r\nsimple and lacking in discernment. In so large a number of men of all\r\nages and of all ranks it is sad to find how few were equipped with\r\nlucid and judicial minds. It would seem as if the human intellect of\r\nthose days was enwrapped in twilight and incapable of seeing anything\r\ndistinctly. Thought as well as speech was curiously puerile. Only a\r\nslight acquaintance with this dark age is enough to make one feel as\r\nif among children. Want and ignorance and wars interminable had\r\nimpoverished the mind of man and starved his moral nature. The scanty,\r\nslashed, ridiculous garments of the nobles and the wealthy betray an\r\nabsurd poverty of taste and weakness of intellect.[49] One of the most\r\nstriking characteristics of these small minds is their triviality;\r\nthey are incapable of attention; they retain nothing. No one who reads\r\nthe writings of the period can fail to be struck by this almost\r\nuniversal weakness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: J. Quicherat, _Histoire du costume_, Paris, 1875, large\r\n8vo, _passim_. G. Demay, _Le costume au moyen age d'apres les sceaux_,\r\nParis, 1880, p. 121, figs. 76 and 77.]\r\n\r\nBy no means all the evidence given in these one hundred and forty\r\ndepositions can be treated seriously. The daughter of Jacques Boucher,\r\nsteward to the Duke of Orleans, depones in the following terms: \"At\r\nnight I slept alone with Jeanne. Neither in her words or her acts did\r\nI ever observe anything wrong. She was perfectly simple, humble, and\r\nchaste.\"[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 34.]\r\n\r\nThis young lady was nine years old when she perceived with a\r\ndiscernment somewhat precocious that her sleeping companion was\r\nsimple, humble, and chaste.\r\n\r\nThat is unimportant. But to show how one may sometimes be deceived by\r\nthe witnesses whom one would expect to be the most reliable, I will\r\nquote Brother Pasquerel.[51] Brother Pasquerel is Jeanne's chaplain.\r\nHe may be expected to speak as one who has seen and as one who knows.\r\nBrother Pasquerel places the examination at Poitiers before the\r\naudience granted by the King to the Maid in the chateau of\r\nChinon.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Ibid._, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: We must notice, however, that Brother Pasquerel, who was\r\nnot present either at Chinon or at Poitiers, is careful to say that he\r\nknows nothing of Jeanne's sojourn in these two towns save what she\r\nherself has told him. Now we are surprised to find that she herself\r\nplaced the examination at Poitiers before the audience at Chinon,\r\nsince she says in her trial that at Chinon, when she gave her King a\r\nsign, the clerks ceased to contend with her.--_Trial_, vol. i, p.\r\n145.]\r\n\r\nForgetting that the whole relieving army had been in Orleans since May\r\n4, he supposes that, on the evening of Friday the 6th, it was still\r\nexpected.[53] From such blunders we may judge of the muddled condition\r\nof this poor priest's brain. His most serious shortcoming, however, is\r\nthe invention of miracles. He tries to make out that when the convoy\r\nof victuals reached Orleans, there occurred, by the Maid's special\r\nintervention, and in order to carry the barges up the river, a sudden\r\nflood of the Loire which no one but himself saw.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Expectando succursum regis_, _Trial_, vol. iii, p.\r\n109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Dunois[55] is also somewhat deceptive. We know that\r\nDunois was one of the most intelligent and prudent men of his day, and\r\nthat he was considered a good speaker. In the defence of Orleans and\r\nin the coronation campaign he had displayed considerable ability.\r\nEither his evidence must have seriously suffered at the hands of the\r\ntranslator and the scribes, or he must have caused it to be given by\r\nhis chaplain. He speaks of the \"great number of the enemy\" in terms\r\nmore appropriate to a canon of a cathedral or a woollen draper than to\r\na captain entrusted with the defence of a city and expected to know\r\nthe actual force of the besiegers. All his evidence dealing with the\r\ntransport of victuals on April 28 is well-nigh unintelligible. And\r\nDunois is unable to state that Troyes was the first stage in the\r\narmy's march from Gien.[56] Relating a conversation he held with the\r\nMaid after the coronation, he makes her speak as if her brothers were\r\nawaiting her at Domremy, whereas they were with her in France.[57]\r\nCuriously blundering, he attempts to prove that Jeanne had visions by\r\nrelating a story much more calculated to give the impression that the\r\nyoung peasant girl was an apt feigner and that at the request of the\r\nnobles she reproduced one of her ecstasies, like the Esther of the\r\nlamented Doctor Luys.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Ibid._, pp. 2 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Ibid._, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Ibid._, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nIn that portion of this work which deals with the rehabilitation trial\r\nI have given my opinion of the evidence of the clerks of the court, of\r\nthe usher Massieu, of the Brothers Isambard de la Pierre and Martin\r\nLadvenu.[59] All these burners of witches and avengers of God worked\r\nas heartily at Jeanne's rehabilitation as they had at her\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 15, 161, 329; vol. iii, pp. 41 and\r\n_passim_.]\r\n\r\nIn many cases and often on events of importance, the evidence of\r\nwitnesses is in direct conflict with the truth. A woollen draper of\r\nOrleans, one Jean Luillier, comes before the commissioners and as bold\r\nas brass maintains that the garrison could not hold out against so\r\ngreat a besieging force.[60] Now this statement is proved to be false\r\nby the most authentic documents, which show that the English round\r\nOrleans were very weak and that their resources were greatly\r\nreduced.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: L. Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise au siege\r\nd'Orleans_ (1428-1429), Orleans, 1892, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nWhen the evidence given at the second trial has obviously been dressed\r\nup to suit the occasion, or even when it is absolutely contrary to the\r\ntruth, we must blame not only those who gave it, but those who\r\nreceived it. In its elicitation the latter were too artful. This\r\nevidence has about as much value as the evidence in a trial by the\r\nInquisition. In certain matters it may represent the ideas of the\r\njudges as much as those of the witnesses.\r\n\r\nWhat the judges in this instance were most desirous to establish was\r\nthat Jeanne had not understood when she was spoken to of the Church\r\nand the Pope, that she had refused to obey the Church Militant because\r\nshe believed the Church Militant to be Messire Cauchon and his\r\nassessors. In short, it was necessary to represent her as almost an\r\nimbecile. In ecclesiastical procedure this expedient was frequently\r\nadopted. And there was yet another reason, a very strong one, for\r\npassing her off as an innocent, a damsel devoid of intelligence. This\r\nsecond trial, like the first, had been instituted with a political\r\nmotive; its object was to make known that Jeanne had come to the aid\r\nof the King of France not by devilish incitement, but by celestial\r\ninspiration. Consequently in order that divine wisdom might be made\r\nmanifest in her she must be shown to have had no wisdom of her own. On\r\nthis string the examiners were constantly harping. On every occasion\r\nthey drew from the witnesses the statement that she was simple, very\r\nsimple. _Una simplex bergereta_,[62] says one. _Erat multum simplex et\r\nignorans_,[63] says another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Ibid._, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nBut since, despite her ignorance, this innocent damsel had been sent\r\nof God to deliver or to capture towns and to lead men at arms, there\r\nmust needs be innate in her a knowledge of the art of war, and in\r\nbattle she must needs manifest the strength and the counsel she had\r\nreceived from above. Wherefore it was necessary to obtain evidence to\r\nestablish that she was more skilled in warfare than any man.\r\n\r\nDamoiselle Marguerite la Touroulde makes this affirmation.[64] The\r\nDuke of Alencon declares that the Maid was apt alike at wielding the\r\nlance, ranging an army, ordering a battle, preparing artillery, and\r\nthat old captains marvelled at her skill in placing cannon.[65] The\r\nDuke quite understands that all these gifts were miraculous and that\r\nto God alone was the glory. For if the merit of the victories had been\r\nJeanne's he would not have said so much about them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Ibid._, p. 100. On the other hand see the evidence of\r\nDunois (vol. iii, p. 16), \"licet dicta Johanna aliquotiens _jocose_\r\nloqueretur de facto armorum, pro animando armatos ... tamen quando\r\nloquebatur seriose de guerra ... nunquam affirmative asserebat nisi\r\nquod erat missa ad levandum obsidionem Aurelianensem.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd if God had chosen the Maid to perform so great a task, it must\r\nhave been because in her he beheld the virtue which he preferred above\r\nall others in his virgins. Henceforth it sufficed not for her to have\r\nbeen chaste; her chastity must become miraculous, her chastity and her\r\nmoderation in eating and drinking must be exalted into sanctity.\r\nWherefore the witnesses are never tired of stating: _Erat casta, erat\r\ncastissima. Ille loquens non credit aliquam mulierem plus esse castam\r\nquam ista Puella erat. Erat sobria in potu et cibo. Erat sobria in\r\ncibo et potu._[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 438, 457; vol. iii, pp. 100,\r\n219.]\r\n\r\nThe heavenly source of such purity must needs have been made manifest\r\nby Jeanne's possessing singular immunities. And on this point there is\r\na mass of evidence. Rough men at arms, Jean de Novelompont, Bertrand\r\nde Poulengy, Jean d'Aulon; great nobles, the Count of Dunois and the\r\nDuke of Alencon, come forward and affirm on oath that in them Jeanne\r\nnever provoked any carnal desires. Such a circumstance fills these old\r\ncaptains with astonishment; they boast of their past vigour and wonder\r\nthat for once their youthful ardour should have been damped by a maid.\r\nIt seems to them most unnatural and humanly impossible. Their\r\ndescription of the effect Jeanne produced upon them recalls Saint\r\nMartha's binding of the Tarascon beast. Dunois in his evidence is very\r\nmuch occupied with miracles. He points to this one as, to human\r\nreason, the most incomprehensible of all. If he neither desired nor\r\nsolicited this damsel, of this unique fact he can find but one\r\nexplanation, it is that Jeanne was holy, _res divina_. When Jean de\r\nNovelompont and Bertrand de Poulengy describe their sudden continence,\r\nthey employ identical forms of speech, affected and involved. And then\r\nthere comes a king's equerry, Gobert Thibaut, who declares that in the\r\narmy there was much talk of this divine grace, vouchsafed to the\r\nArmagnacs[67] and denied to English and Burgundians, at least, so the\r\nbehaviour of a certain knight of Picardy, and of one Jeannotin, a\r\ntailor of Rouen, would lead us to believe.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 438; vol. iii, pp. 15, 76, 100,\r\n219, and 457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 89 and 121.]\r\n\r\nSuch evidence obviously answers to the ideas of the judges, and turns,\r\nso to speak, on theological rather than on natural facts.\r\n\r\nIn inquisitorial inquiries there abound such depositions as those of\r\nJean de Novelompont and of Bertrand de Poulengy, containing passages\r\ndrawn up in identical terms. But I must admit that in the\r\nrehabilitation trial they are rare, partly because the witnesses were\r\nheard at long intervals of time and in different countries, and partly\r\nbecause in the Maid's case no elaborate proceedings were necessary\r\nowing to her adversaries not being represented.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that all the evidence given at this trial, with\r\nthe exception of that of Jean d'Aulon, should have been translated\r\ninto Latin. This process has obscured fine shades of thought and\r\ndeprived the evidence of its original flavour.\r\n\r\nSometimes the clerk contents himself with saying that the depositions\r\nof a witness were like those of his predecessor. Thus on the raising\r\nof the siege of Orleans all the burgesses depone like the woollen\r\ndraper, who himself was not thoroughly conversant with the\r\ncircumstances in which his town had been delivered. Thus the Sire de\r\nGaucourt, after a brief declaration, gives the same evidence as\r\nDunois, although the Count had related matters so strikingly\r\nindividual that it seems strange they should have been common to two\r\nwitnesses.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 2 and 35.]\r\n\r\nCertain evidence would appear to have been cut short. Brother\r\nPasquerel's abruptly comes to an end at Paris. This circumstance, if\r\nwe did not possess his signature at the conclusion of the Latin letter\r\nto the Hussites, would lead us to believe that the good Brother left\r\nthe Maid immediately after the attack on La Porte Saint-Honore. It\r\nsurely cannot have chanced that in so long a series of questions and\r\nanswers not one word was said of the departure from Sully or of the\r\ncampaign which began at Lagny and ended at Compiegne.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 100 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nWe conclude, therefore, that in the study of this voluminous evidence\r\nwe must exercise great judgment and that we must not expect it to\r\nenlighten us on all the circumstances of Jeanne's life.\r\n\r\nFourthly. On certain points of the Maid's history the only exact\r\ninformation is to be obtained from account-books, letters, deeds, and\r\nother authentic documents of the period. The records published by\r\nSimeon Luce and the lease of the Chateau de l'Ile inform us of the\r\ncircumstances among which Jeanne grew up.[71] Neither the two trials\r\nnor the chronicles had revealed the terrible conditions prevailing in\r\nthe village of Domremy from 1412 to 1425.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Simeon Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy, recherches\r\ncritiques sur les origines de la mission de la Pucelle_, Paris, 1886,\r\nin 8vo; _La France pendant la guerre de cent ans: episodes historiques\r\net vie privee aux xiv'e et xv'e siecles_, Paris, 1890, in 12mo.]\r\n\r\nThe fortress accounts kept at Orleans[72] and the documents of the\r\nEnglish administration[73] enable us to estimate approximately the\r\nrespective forces of defenders and besiegers of the city. On this\r\npoint also they enable us to correct the statements of chroniclers and\r\nwitnesses in the rehabilitation trial.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: D.

Robillard de Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur le proces\r\nde condamnation de Jeanne d'Arc_, Rouen, 1869, in 8vo [_Precis des\r\ntravaux de l'Academie de Rouen, 1867-1868_, pp. 321-448]; _Notes sur\r\nles juges et les assesseurs du proces de condamnation de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, Rouen, 1890, in 8vo [_Precis des travaux de l'Academie de\r\nRouen, 1888-1889_, pp. 375-504].]\r\n\r\nHow many other detached papers, all valuable to the historian, might I\r\nnot enumerate! Surely this is another reason for mistrusting records\r\nfalse or falsified, as, for example, the patent of nobility of Guy de\r\nCailly.[76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 342 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nRapid as this examination of authorities has been, I think nothing\r\nessential has been omitted. To sum up, even in her lifetime the Maid\r\nwas scarce known save by fables. Her oldest chroniclers were devoid of\r\nany critical sense, for the early legends concerning her they relate\r\nas facts.\r\n\r\nThe Rouen trial, certain accounts, a few letters, sundry deeds, public\r\nand private, are the most trustworthy documents. The rehabilitation\r\ntrial is also useful to the historian, provided always that we\r\nremember how and why that trial was conducted.\r\n\r\nBy means of such records we may attain to a pretty accurate knowledge\r\nof Jeanne d'Arc's life and character.\r\n\r\nThe salient fact which results from a study of all these authorities\r\nis that she was a saint. She was a saint with all the attributes of\r\nfifteenth-century sanctity. She had visions, and these visions were\r\nneither feigned nor counterfeited. She really believed that she heard\r\nthe voices which spoke to her and came from no human lips. These\r\nvoices generally addressed her clearly and in words she could\r\nunderstand. She heard them best in the woods and when the bells were\r\nringing. She saw forms, she said, like myriads of tiny shapes, like\r\nsparks on a dazzling background. There is no doubt she had visions of\r\nanother nature, since she tells us how she beheld Saint Michael in the\r\nguise of a _prud'homme_, that is as a good knight, and Saint Catherine\r\nand Saint Margaret, wearing crowns. She saw them saluting her; she\r\nkissed their feet and inhaled their sweet perfume.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean if not that she was subject to hallucinations of\r\nhearing, sight, touch, and smell? But the most strongly affected of\r\nher senses was her hearing. She says that her voices appear to her;\r\nshe sometimes calls them her council. She hears them very plainly\r\nunless there is a noise around her. Generally she obeys them; but\r\nsometimes she resists. We may doubt whether her visions were really so\r\ndistinct as she makes out. Because she either could not, or would not,\r\nshe never gave her judges at Rouen any very clear or precise\r\ndescription of them. The angel she described most in detail was the\r\none which brought the crown, and which she afterwards confessed to\r\nhave seen only in imagination.\r\n\r\nAt what age did she become subject to these trances? We cannot say\r\nexactly. But it was probably towards the end of her childhood,\r\nnotwithstanding that according to Jean d'Aulon, childhood was a state\r\nout of which she never completely developed.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is always hazardous to found a medical diagnosis on\r\ndocuments purely historical, several men of science have attempted to\r\ndefine the pathological conditions which rendered the young girl\r\nsubject to false perceptions of sight and hearing.[78] Owing to the\r\nrapid strides made by psychiatry during recent years, I have consulted\r\nan eminent man of science, who is thoroughly conversant with the\r\npresent stage attained by this branch of pathology, to which he has\r\nhimself rendered important service. I asked Doctor Georges Dumas,\r\nProfessor at the Sorbonne, whether sufficient material exists for\r\nscience to make a retrospective diagnosis of Jeanne's case. He replied\r\nto my inquiry in a letter which appears as the first Appendix to this\r\nwork.[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Briere de Boismont, _De l'hallucination historique, ou\r\netude medico-psychique sur les voix et les revelations de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, 1861, in 8vo. Le Vicomte de Mouchy, _Jeanne d'Arc, etude\r\nhistorique et psychologique_, Montpellier, 1868, in 8vo, 67 pp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Vol. ii, Appendix i.]\r\n\r\nWith such a subject I am not qualified to deal. But it does lie within\r\nmy province to make an observation concerning the hallucinations of\r\nJeanne d'Arc, which has been suggested to me by a study of the\r\ndocuments. This observation is of infinite significance. I shall be\r\ncareful to restrict it to the limits prescribed by the object and the\r\nnature of this work.\r\n\r\nThose visionaries, who believe they are entrusted with a divine\r\nmission, are distinguished by certain characteristics from other\r\ninspired persons. When mystics of this class are studied and compared\r\nwith one another, resemblances are found to exist which may extend to\r\nvery slight details: certain of their words and acts are identical.\r\nIndeed as we come to recognise how vigorous is the determinism\r\ncontrolling the actions of these visionaries, we are astonished to\r\nfind the human machine, when impelled by the same mysterious agent,\r\nperforming its functions with inevitable uniformity. To this group of\r\nthe religious Jeanne belongs. In this connection it is interesting to\r\ncompare her with Saint Catherine of Sienna,[80] Saint Colette of\r\nCorbie,[81] Yves Nicolazic, the peasant of Kernanna,[82] Suzette\r\nLabrousse, the inspired woman of the Revolution Church,[83] and with\r\nmany other seers and seeresses of this order, who all bear a family\r\nlikeness to one another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Acta Sanctorum_, 1675, April, iii, 851.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Ibid._, March 1, 1532.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Le Pere Hugues de Saint-Francois, _Les grandeurs de Sainte\r\nAnne_, Rennes, 1657, in 8vo; L'abbe Max Nicol, _Sainte-Anne-d'Auray_,\r\nParis, Brussels, s.d., in 8vo, pp. 37 _et seq._ M. le Docteur G. de\r\nClosmadeuc has kindly lent me his valuable work, as yet unpublished,\r\non Yves Nicolazic, which is characterised by the same exactness of\r\ninformation and of criticism as are to be found in his studies of\r\nlocal history.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Recueil des ouvrages de la celebre Mademoiselle\r\nLabrousse, du Bourg de Vauxains, en Perigord, canton de Ribeirac de la\r\nDordogne, actuellement prisonniere au chateau Saint-Ange, a Rome_,\r\nBordeaux, 1797, in 8vo; E. Lairtullier, _Les femmes celebres de 1789 a\r\n1795_, Paris, 1842, in 8vo, vol. i, pp. 212 _et seq._; Abbe Chr.\r\nMoreau, _Une mystique revolutionnaire Suzette Labrousse_, Paris, 1886,\r\nin 8vo; A. France, _Susette Labrousse_, Paris, 1907, in 12mo.]\r\n\r\nThree visionaries especially are closely related to Jeanne. The\r\nearliest in date is a vavasour of Champagne, who had a mission to speak\r\nto King John; of this holy man I have written sufficiently in the\r\npresent work. The second is a farrier of Salon, who had a mission to\r\nspeak to Louis XIV; the third, a peasant of Gallardon, named Martin,\r\nwho had a mission to speak to Louis XVIII. Articles on the farrier and\r\nthe farmer, who both saw apparitions and showed signs to their\r\nrespective kings, will be found in the appendices at the end of this\r\nwork.[84] In spite of difference in sex, the points of similarity\r\nbetween Jeanne d'Arc and these three men are very close and very\r\nsignificant; they are inherent in the very nature of Jeanne and her\r\nfellow visionaries; and the variations, which at a first glance might\r\nseem to separate widely the latter from Jeanne, are aesthetic, social,\r\nhistorical, and consequently external and contingent. Between them and\r\nher there are of course striking contrasts in appearance and in\r\nfortune. They were entirely wanting in that charm which she never\r\nfailed to exercise; and it is a fact that while they failed miserably\r\nshe grew in strength and flowered in legend. But it is the duty of the\r\nscientific mind to recognise common characteristics, proving identity\r\nof origin alike in the noblest individual and in the most wretched\r\nabortion of the same species.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Vol. ii, Appendices ii and iii.]\r\n\r\nThe free-thinkers of our day, imbued as they are, for the most part,\r\nwith transcendentalism, refuse to recognise in Jeanne not merely that\r\nautomatism which determines the acts of such a seeress, not only the\r\ninfluence of constant hallucination, but even the suggestions of the\r\nreligious spirit. What she achieved through saintliness and\r\ndevoutness, they make her out to have accomplished by intelligent\r\nenthusiasm. Such a disposition is manifest in the excellent and\r\nerudite Quicherat, who all unconsciously introduces into the piety of\r\nthe Maid a great deal of eclectic philosophy. This point was not\r\nwithout its drawbacks. It led free-thinking historians to a ridiculous\r\nexaggeration of Jeanne's intellectual faculties, to the absurdity of\r\nattributing military talent to her and to the substitution of a kind\r\nof polytechnic phenomenon for the fifteenth century's artless marvel.\r\nThe Catholic historians of the present day when they make a saint of\r\nthe Maid are much nearer to nature and to truth. Unfortunately the\r\nChurch's idea of saintliness has grown insipid since the Council of\r\nTrent, and orthodox historians are disinclined to study the variations\r\nof the Catholic Church down the ages. In their hands therefore she\r\nbecomes sanctimonious and bigoted. So much so that in a search for the\r\nmost curiously travestied of all the Jeannes d'Arc we should have been\r\ndriven to choose between their miraculous protectress of Christian\r\nFrance, the patroness of officers, the inimitable model of the pupils\r\nof Saint-Cyr, and the romantic Druidess, the inspired woman-soldier of\r\nthe national guard, the patriot gunneress of the Republicans, had\r\nthere not arisen a Jesuit Father to create an ultramontane Jeanne\r\nd'Arc.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Le P. Ayroles, _La vraie Jeanne d'Arc_, 5 vols. in large\r\n8vo, Paris, 1894-1902. Writing of this book in a study of\r\n_L'Abjuration de Jeanne d'Arc_ (Paris, 1902, pp. 7 and 8, note), Canon\r\nUlysse Chevalier, author of a valuable _Repertoire des sources du\r\nmoyen age_, displays boldness and sound sense. \"From the dimensions of\r\nthese five volumes,\" he says, \"one might expect this work to be the\r\nfullest history of Jeanne d'Arc; it is nothing of the sort. It is a\r\nchaos of memoranda translated or rendered into modern French,\r\nreflections and arguments against free-thought as represented by\r\nMichelet, H. Martin, Quicherat, Vallet de Viriville, Simeon Luce, and\r\nJoseph Fabre. Two headings will suffice to give an idea of the book's\r\ntone: _The Pseudo-theologians, executioners of Jeanne d'Arc,\r\nexecutioners of the Papacy_ (vol. i, p. 87); _The University of Paris\r\nand the Brigandage of Rouen_ (p. 149). The author too often judges the\r\nfifteenth century by the standards of the nineteenth. Is he quite sure\r\nthat if he had been a member of the University of Paris in 1431 he\r\nwould have thought and pronounced in favour of Jeanne, and in\r\nopposition to his colleagues?\"]\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Jeanne's sincerity I have raised no doubts. It is\r\nimpossible to suspect her of lying; she firmly believed that she\r\nreceived her mission from her voices. But whether she were not\r\nunconsciously directed is more difficult to ascertain. What we know of\r\nher before her arrival at Chinon comes to very little. One is inclined\r\nto believe that she had been subject to certain influences; it is so\r\nwith all visionaries: some unseen director leads them. Thus it must\r\nhave been with Jeanne. At Vaucouleurs she was heard to say that the\r\nDauphin held the kingdom in fief (_en commende_).[86] Such a term she\r\nhad not learnt from the folk of her village. She uttered a prophecy\r\nwhich she had not invented and which had obviously been fabricated for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 456.]\r\n\r\nShe must have associated with priests who were faithful to the cause\r\nof the Dauphin Charles, and who desired above all things the end of\r\nthe war. Abbeys were being burned, churches pillaged, divine service\r\ndiscontinued.[87] Those pious persons who sighed for peace, now that\r\nthey saw the Treaty of Troyes failing to establish it, looked for the\r\nrealisation of their hopes to the expulsion of the English. And the\r\nwonderful, the unique point about this young peasant girl--a point\r\nsuggesting the ecclesiastic and the monk--is not that she felt herself\r\ncalled to ride forth and fight, but that in \"her great pity\" she\r\nannounced the approaching end of the war, by the victory and\r\ncoronation of the King, at a time when the nobles of the two\r\ncountries, and the men-at-arms of the two parties, neither expected\r\nnor desired the war ever to come to an end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Le P. Denifle, _La desolation des eglises, monasteres\r\nhopitaux en France vers le milieu du xv'ieme siecle_, Macon, 1897,\r\nin 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe mission, with which she believed the angel had entrusted her and\r\nto which she consecrated her life, was doubtless extraordinary,\r\nmarvellous; and yet it was not unprecedented: it was no more than\r\nsaints, both men and women, had already endeavoured to accomplish in\r\nhuman affairs. Jeanne d'Arc arose in the decline of the great Catholic\r\nage, when sainthood, usually accompanied by all manner of oddities,\r\nmanias, and illusions, still wielded sovereign power over the minds of\r\nmen. And of what miracles was she not capable when acting according to\r\nthe impulses of her own heart, and the grace of her own mind? From the\r\nthirteenth to the fifteenth centuries God's servants perform wondrous\r\nworks. Saint Dominic, possessed by holy wrath, exterminates heresy\r\nwith fire and sword; Saint Francis of Assisi for the nonce founds\r\npoverty as an institution of society; Saint Antony of Padua defends\r\nmerchants and artisans against the avarice and cruelty of nobles and\r\nbishops; Saint Catherine brings the Pope back to Rome. Was it\r\nimpossible, therefore, for a saintly damsel, with God's aid, to\r\nre-establish within the hapless realm of France that royal power\r\ninstituted by our Lord Himself and to bring to his coronation a new\r\nJoash snatched from death for the salvation of the holy people?\r\n\r\nThus did pious French folk, in the year 1428, regard the mission of\r\nthe Maid. She represented herself as a devout damsel inspired by God.\r\nThere was nothing incredible in that. When she announced that she had\r\nreceived revelations touching the war from my Lord Saint Michael, she\r\ninspired the men-at-arms of the Armagnac party and the burghers of the\r\ncity of Orleans with a confidence as great as could have been\r\ncommunicated to the troops, marching along the Loire in the winter of\r\n1871, by a republican engineer who had invented a smokeless powder or\r\nan improved form of cannon. What was expected from science in 1871 was\r\nexpected from religion in 1428, so that the Bastard of Orleans would\r\nas naturally employ Jeanne as Gambetta would resort to the technical\r\nknowledge of M. de Freycinet.\r\n\r\nWhat has not been sufficiently remarked upon is that the French party\r\nmade a very adroit use of her. The clerks at Poitiers, while inquiring\r\nat great length into her religion and her morals, brought her into\r\nevidence. These Poitiers clerks were no monks ignorant of the world;\r\nthey constituted the Parliament of the lawful King; they were the\r\nbanished members of the University, men deeply involved in political\r\naffairs, compromised by revolutions, despoiled and ruined, and very\r\nimpatient to regain possession of their property. They were directed\r\nby the cleverest man in the King's Council, the Duke Archbishop of\r\nReims, the Chancellor of the kingdom. By the ceremoniousness and the\r\ndeliberation of their inquiries, they drew upon Jeanne the curiosity,\r\nthe interest, and the hopes of minds lost in amazement.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: O. Raguenet, _Les juges de Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers,\r\nmembres du Parlement ou gens d'Eglise?_ in _Lettres et memoires de\r\nl'Academie de Sainte-Croix d'Orleans VII_, 1894, pp. 339-442; D.\r\nLacombe, _L'hote de Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers, maitre Jean Rabateau,\r\nPresident au Parlement de Poitiers in Revue du Bas-Poitou_, 1891, pp.\r\n46-66.]\r\n\r\nThe defences of the city of Orleans consisted in its walls, its\r\ntrenches, its cannon, its men-at-arms, and its money. The English had\r\nfailed both to surround it and to take it by assault. Convoys and\r\ncompanies passed between their bastions. Jeanne was introduced into\r\nthe town with a strong relieving army. She brought flocks of oxen,\r\nsheep, and pigs. The townsfolk believed her to be an angel of the\r\nLord. Meanwhile the men and the money of the besiegers were waxing\r\nscant. They had lost all their horses. Far from being in a position to\r\nattempt a new attack, they were not likely to be able to hold out long\r\nin their bastions. At the end of April there were four thousand\r\nEnglish before Orleans and perhaps less, for, as it was said, soldiers\r\nwere deserting every day; and companies of these deserters went\r\nplundering through the villages. At the same time the city was\r\ndefended by six thousand men-at-arms and archers, and by more than\r\nthree thousand men of the town bands. At Saint Loup, there were\r\nfifteen hundred French against four hundred English; at Les Tourelles,\r\nthere were five thousand French against four or five hundred English.\r\nBy their retreat from Orleans the _Godons_ abandoned to their fate the\r\nsmall garrisons of Jargeau, Meung, and Beaugency.[89] The Battle of\r\nPatay gives us some idea of the condition of the English army. It was\r\nno battle but a massacre, and one which Jeanne only reached in time to\r\nmourn over the cruelty of the conquerors. And yet the King, in his\r\nletters to his good towns, attributed to her a share in the victory.\r\nEvidently the Royal Council made a point of glorifying its Holy Maid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Mr. Andrew Lang (_La Jeanne d'Arc de M. Anatole France_,\r\np. 60) misreads this passage when he takes it to mean that the English\r\nwithdrew their garrisons from these places. That their ultimate\r\nsurrender became inevitable after the English retreat from Orleans is\r\nwhat the writer intends to convey.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nBut at heart what did they really think, those who employed her, those\r\nRegnaults de Chartres, those Roberts le Macon, those Gerards Machet?\r\nThey were certainly in no position to discuss the origin of the\r\nillusions which enveloped her. And, albeit there were atheists even\r\namong churchmen, to the majority there would be nothing to cause\r\nastonishment in the appearance of Saint Michael, the Archangel. In\r\nthose days nothing appeared more natural than a miracle. But a miracle\r\nvanishes when closely observed. And they had the damsel before their\r\nvery eyes. They perceived that good and saintly as she was, she\r\nwielded no supernatural power.\r\n\r\nWhile the men-at-arms and all the common folk welcomed her as the maid\r\nof God and an angel sent from heaven for the salvation of the realm,\r\nthese good lords thought only of profiting from the sentiments of\r\nconfidence which she inspired and in which they had little share.\r\nFinding her as ignorant as possible, and doubtless deeming her less\r\nintelligent than she really was, they intended to do as they liked\r\nwith her. They must soon have discovered that it was not always easy.\r\nShe was a saint, saints are intractable. What were the true relations\r\nbetween the Royal Council and the Maid? We do not know; and it is a\r\nmystery which will never be solved. The judges at Rouen thought they\r\nknew that she received letters from Saint Michael.[90] It is possible\r\nthat her simplicity was sometimes taken advantage of. We have reason\r\nfor believing that the march to Reims was not suggested to her in\r\nFrance; but there is no doubt that the Chancellor of the kingdom,\r\nMessire Regnault de Chartres, Archbishop of Reims, eagerly desired his\r\nrestoration to the see of the Blessed Saint Remi and the enjoyment of\r\nhis benefices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nThe coronation campaign was really nothing but a series of\r\nnegotiations, backed by an army. Its object was to show the good towns\r\na king saintly and pacific. Had there been any idea of fighting, the\r\ncampaign would have been directed against Paris or against Normandy.\r\n\r\nAt the inquiry of 1456, five or six witnesses, captains, magistrates,\r\necclesiastics, and an honest widow, gave evidence that Jeanne was well\r\nversed in the art of war. They agreed in saying that she rode a horse\r\nand wielded a lance better than any one. A master of requests stated\r\nthat she amazed the army by the length of time she could remain in the\r\nsaddle. Such qualities we are not entitled to deny her, neither can we\r\ndispute the diligence and the ardour which Dunois praised in her, on\r\nthe occasion of a demonstration by night before Troyes.[91] As to the\r\nopinion that this damsel was clever in arraying and leading an army\r\nand especially skilled in the management of artillery, that is more\r\ndifficult to credit and would require to be vouched for by some one\r\nmore trustworthy than the poor Duke of Alencon, who was never\r\nconsidered a very rational person.[92] What we have said about the\r\nrehabilitation trial sufficiently explains this curious glorification\r\nof the Maid. It was understood that Jeanne's military inspiration came\r\nfrom God. Henceforth there was no danger of its being too much admired\r\nand it came to be praised somewhat at random.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Ibid._, p. 100. See _ante_, p. xxvi (note 4).]\r\n\r\nAfter all the Duke of Alencon was quite moderate when he represented\r\nher as a distinguished artillery-woman. As early as 1429, a humanist\r\non the side of Charles VII asserted in Ciceronian language that in\r\nmilitary glory she equalled and surpassed Hector, Alexander, Hannibal\r\nand Caesar: \"Non Hectore reminiscat et gaudeat Troja, exultet Graecia\r\nAlexandro, Annibale Africa, Italia Caesare et Romanis ducibus omnibus\r\nglorietur, Gallia etsi ex pristinis multos habeat, hac tamen una\r\nPuella contenta, audebit se gloriari et laude bellica caeteris\r\nnationibus se comparare, verum quoque, si expediet, se anteponere.\"[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Letter from Alain Chartier in the _Trial_, vol. v, pp.\r\n135, 136; Capitaine P. Marin, _Jeanne d'Arc tacticien et strategiste_,\r\nParis, 1889, 4 vols. in 12mo; Le General Canonge, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\nguerriere_, Paris, 1907, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nFor ever praying and for ever wrapped in ecstasy, Jeanne never\r\nobserved the enemy; she did not know the roads; she paid no heed to\r\nthe number of troops engaged; she did not take into account either the\r\nheight of walls or the breadth of trenches. Even to-day officers are\r\nto be heard discussing the Maid's military tactics.[94] Those tactics\r\nwere simple; they consisted in preventing men from blaspheming against\r\nGod and consorting with light women. She believed that for their sins\r\nthey would be destroyed, but that if they fought in a state of grace\r\nthey would win the victory. Therein lay all her military science, save\r\nthat she never feared danger.[95] She displayed a courage which was at\r\nonce proud and gentle; she was more valiant, more constant, more noble\r\nthan the men and in that worthy to lead them. And is it not admirable\r\nand rare to find such heroism united to such innocence?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _Rossel et la legende de Jeanne d'Arc_ in _la Petite\r\nRepublique_ of July 15, 1896; _Jeanne d'Arc soldat_ by Art Roe, in _le\r\nTemps_ of May 8, 1907. See also the works of Captain Marin, always so\r\npraiseworthy for their carefulness and good faith.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nCertain of the leaders indeed, and notably the princes of the blood\r\nroyal, knew no more than she. The art of war in those days resolved\r\nitself into the art of riding. Any idea of marching along converging\r\nlines, of concentrated movements, of a campaign methodically planned,\r\nof a prolonged effort with a view to some great result was unknown.\r\nMilitary tactics were nothing more than a collection of peasants'\r\nstratagems and a few rules of chivalry. The freebooters, captains, and\r\nsoldiers of fortune were all acquainted with the tricks of the trade,\r\nbut they recognised neither friend nor foe; and their one desire was\r\npillage. The nobles affected great concern for honour and praise; in\r\nreality they thought of nothing but gain. Alain Chartier said of them:\r\n\"They cry 'to arms,' but they fight for money.\"[96]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Alain Chartier, _Oeuvres_, ed. Andre du Chesne, p.\r\n412.]\r\n\r\nSeeing that war was to last as long as life, it was waged with\r\ndeliberation. Men-at-arms, horse-soldiers and foot, archers,\r\ncross-bowmen, Armagnacs as well as English and Burgundians, fought\r\nwith no great ardour. Of course they were brave: but they were\r\ncautious too and were not ashamed to confess it. Jean Chartier,\r\nprecentor of Saint-Denys, chronicler of the Kings of France, relating\r\nhow on a day the French met the English near Lagny, adds: \"And there\r\nthe battle was hard and fierce, for the French were barely more than\r\nthe English.\"[97] These simple folk, seeing that one man is as good as\r\nanother, admitted the risk of fighting one to one. Their minds had not\r\nfed on Plutarch as had those of the Revolution and the Empire. And for\r\ntheir encouragement they had neither the _carmagnoles_ of Barrere, nor\r\nthe songs of Marie-Joseph Chenier, nor the bulletins of _la grande\r\narmee_. Why did these captains, these men-at-arms go and fight in one\r\nplace rather than in another seems to be a natural question....\r\nBecause they wanted goods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Jean Chartier, _Chronique de Charles VII_, vol. i, p.\r\n121.]\r\n\r\nThis perpetual warfare was not sanguinary. During what was described\r\nas Jeanne d'Arc's mission, that is from Orleans to Compiegne, the\r\nFrench lost barely a few hundred men. The English suffered much more\r\nheavily, because they were the fugitives, and in a rout it was the\r\ncustom for the conquerors to kill all those who were not worth holding\r\nto ransom. But battles were rare, and so consequently were defeats,\r\nand the number of the combatants was small. There were but a handful\r\nof English in France. And they may be said to have fought only for\r\nplunder. Those who suffered from the war were those who did not fight,\r\nburghers, priests, and peasants. The peasants endured terrible\r\nhardships, and it is quite conceivable that a peasant girl should have\r\ndisplayed a firmness in war, a persistence and an ardour unknown\r\nthroughout the whole of chivalry.\r\n\r\nIt was not Jeanne who drove the English from France. If she\r\ncontributed to the deliverance of Orleans, she retarded the ultimate\r\nsalvation of France by causing the opportunity of conquering Normandy\r\nto be lost through the coronation campaign. The misfortunes of the\r\nEnglish after 1428 are easily explained. While in peaceful Guyenne\r\nthey engaged in agriculture, in commerce, in navigation, and set the\r\nfinances in good order, the country which they had rendered prosperous\r\nwas strongly attached to them. On the banks of the Seine and the Loire\r\nit was very different; there they had never taken root; in numbers\r\nthey were always too few, and they had never obtained any hold on the\r\ncountry. Shut up in fortresses and chateaux, they did not cultivate\r\nthe country enough to conquer it, for one must work on the land if one\r\nwould take possession of it. They left it waste and abandoned it to\r\nthe soldiers of fortune by whom it was ravaged and exhausted. Their\r\ngarrisons, absurdly small, were prisoners in the country they had\r\nconquered. The English had long teeth, but a pike cannot swallow an\r\nox. That they were too few and that France was too big had been\r\nplainly seen after Crecy and after Poitiers. Then, after Verneuil,\r\nduring the troubled reign of a child, weakened by civil discord,\r\nlacking men and money, and bound to keep in subjection the countries\r\nof Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, were they likely to succeed better?\r\nIn 1428, they were but a handful in France, and to maintain themselves\r\nthere they depended on the help of the Duke of Burgundy, who\r\nhenceforth deserted them and wished them every possible harm.\r\n\r\nThey lacked means alike for the capture of new provinces and the\r\npacification of those they had already conquered. The very character\r\nof the sovereignty their princes claimed, the nature of the rights\r\nthey asserted, which were founded on institutions common to the two\r\ncountries, rendered the organisation of their conquest difficult\r\nwithout the consent and even, one may say, without the loyal\r\nconcurrence and friendship of the conquered. The Treaty of Troyes did\r\nnot subject France to England, it united one country to the other.\r\nSuch a union occasioned much anxiety in London. The Commons did not\r\nconceal their fear that Old England might become a mere isolated\r\nprovince of the new kingdom.[98] France for her part did not concur in\r\nthe union. It was too late. During all the time that they had been\r\nmaking war on these _Coues_[99] they had grown to hate them. And\r\npossibly there already existed an English character and a French\r\ncharacter which were irreconcilable. Even in Paris, where the\r\nArmagnacs were as much feared as the Saracens, the _Godons_[100] met\r\nwith very unwilling support. What surprises us is not that the English\r\nshould have been driven from France, but that it should have happened\r\nso slowly. Does this amount to saying that the young saint had no part\r\nwhatever in the work of deliverance? By no means. Hers was the nobler,\r\nthe better part; the part of sacrifice; she set the example of the\r\nhighest courage and displayed heroism in a form unexpected and\r\ncharming. The King's cause, which was indeed the national cause, she\r\nserved in two ways: by giving confidence to the men-at-arms of her\r\nparty, who believed her to be a bringer of good fortune, and by\r\nstriking fear into the English, who imagined her to be the devil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: See the deliberations of the Commons on December 2,\r\n1421, in Brequigny, _Lettres de rois, reines et autres personnages des\r\ncours de France et d'Angleterre_, Paris, 1847 (2 vols. in 4to), vol.\r\nii, pp. 393 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: For the origin of this term see _post_, vol. i, p. 22\r\nand note 2.--W.S.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: For the origin of this term see _ibid._ and note\r\n1.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nOur best historians cannot forgive the ministers and captains of 1428\r\nfor not having blindly obeyed the Maid. But that was not at all the\r\nadvice given at the time by the Archbishop of Embrun to King Charles;\r\nhe, on the contrary, recommended him not to abandon the means inspired\r\nby human reason.[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: The Reverend Father M. Fornier, _Histoire des\r\nAlpes-Maritimes_, Paris, 1890, in 8vo, vol. ii, p. 324; Lanery d'Arc,\r\n_Memoires et consultations_, pp. 565 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been repeated that the lords and captains were\r\njealous of her, especially old Gaucourt.[102] But such a statement\r\nshows an absolute ignorance of human nature. They were envious one of\r\nanother; this and no other sentiment was the jealousy that made them\r\ntolerate the Maid's assuming the title of commander in war.[103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 117; _Perceval de Cagny_, p. 168;\r\nMarquis de Gaucourt, _Le sire de Gaucourt_, Orleans, 1855, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Perceval de Cagny_, pp. 168, 170, 171; _Cronicques de\r\nNormendie_, ed. Hellot, pp. 77, 78.]\r\n\r\nThose secret intrigues on the part of the King and his captains, who\r\nare said to have plotted together the destruction of the saint, I\r\nadmit having found it impossible to discover. To certain historians\r\nthey appear very obvious: for my part, do what I may, I cannot discern\r\nthem. The Chamberlain, the Sire de la Tremouille, had no pretensions\r\nto nobility of character; and the Chancellor Regnault de Chartres was\r\nhard-hearted, but what strikes me is that the Sire de la Tremouille\r\nrefused to give up this valuable damsel to the Duke of Alencon when he\r\nasked for her, and that the Chancellor retained her in order to make\r\nuse of her.[104] I am not of the opinion that Jeanne was a prisoner at\r\nSully. I believe that when she went to join the Chancellor, who\r\nemployed her until her capture by the Burgundians, she quitted the\r\ncastle in estate, with trumpeters, and banners flying. After the girl\r\nsaint he employed a boy saint, a shepherd who had stigmata; which\r\nproves that he did not regret having made use of a devout person to\r\nfight against the King's enemies and to recover his own archbishopric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Perceval de Cagny_, pp. 170, 171; _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 313; Heraut Berry, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe excellent Quicherat and the magnanimous Henri Martin are very hard\r\non the Government of 1428. According to them it was a treacherous\r\nGovernment. Yet the only reproach they bring against Charles VII and\r\nhis councillors is that they did not understand the Maid as they\r\nthemselves understood her. But such an understanding has required the\r\nlapse of four hundred years. To arrive at the illuminated ideas of a\r\nQuicherat and a Henri Martin concerning Jeanne d'Arc, three centuries\r\nof absolute monarchy, the Reformation, the Revolution, the wars of the\r\nRepublic and of the Empire, and the sentimental Neo-Catholicism of\r\n'48, have all been necessary. Through all these brilliant prisms,\r\nthrough all these succeeding lights do romantic historians and\r\nbroad-minded paleographers view the figure of Jeanne d'Arc; and we ask\r\ntoo much from the poor Dauphin Charles, from La Tremouille, from\r\nRegnault de Chartres, from the Lord of Treves, from old Gaucourt, when\r\nwe require them to have seen Jeanne as centuries have made and moulded\r\nher.[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: H. Martin, _Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 1856, in 12mo; J.\r\nQuicherat, _Nouvelles preuves des trahisons essuyees par la Pucelle_\r\nin _Revue de Normandie_, vol. vi (1866), pp. 396-401.]\r\n\r\nThis, however, remains: after having made so much use of her, the\r\nRoyal Council did nothing to save her.\r\n\r\nMust the disgrace of such neglect fall upon the whole Council and upon\r\nthe Council alone? Who ought really to have interfered? And how? What\r\nought King Charles to have done? Should he have offered to ransom the\r\nMaid? She would not have been surrendered to him at any price. As for\r\ncapturing her by force, that is a mere child's dream. Had they entered\r\nRouen, the French would not have found her there; Warwick would always\r\nhave had time to put her in a place of safety, or to drown her in the\r\nriver. Neither money nor arms would have availed to recapture her.\r\n\r\nBut this was no reason for standing with folded arms. Influence could\r\nhave been brought to bear on those who were conducting the trial.\r\nDoubtless they were all on the side of the _Godons_; that old\r\n_Cabochien_ of a Pierre Cauchon was very much committed to them; he\r\ndetested the French; the clerks, who owed allegiance to Henry VI,\r\nwere naturally inclined to please the Great Council of England which\r\ndisposed of patronage; the doctors and masters of the University of\r\nFrance greatly hated and feared the Armagnacs. And yet the judges of\r\nthe trial were not all infamous prevaricators; the chapter of Rouen\r\nlacked neither courage nor independence.[106] Among those members of\r\nthe University who were so bitter against Jeanne, there were men\r\nhighly esteemed for doctrine and character. They for the most part\r\nbelieved this trial to be a purely religious one. By dint of seeking\r\nfor witches, they had come to find them everywhere. These females, as\r\nthey called them, they were sending to the stake every day, and\r\nreceiving nothing but thanks for it. They believed as firmly as Jeanne\r\nin the possibility of the apparitions which she said had been\r\nvouchsafed to her, only they were persuaded either that she lied or\r\nthat she saw devils. The Bishop, the Vice-Inquisitor and the\r\nassessors, to the number of forty and upwards, were unanimous in\r\ndeclaring her heretical and devilish. There were doubtless many who\r\nimagined that by passing sentence against her they were maintaining\r\nCatholic orthodoxy and unity of obedience against the abettors of\r\nschism and heresy; they wished to judge wisely. And even the boldest\r\nand the most unscrupulous, the Bishop and the Promoter, would not have\r\ndared too openly to infringe the rules of ecclesiastical justice in\r\norder to please the English. They were priests, and they preserved\r\npriestly pride and respect for formality. Here was their weak point;\r\nin this respect for formality they might have been struck. Had the\r\nother side instituted vigorous legal proceedings, theirs might\r\npossibly have been thwarted, arrested, and the fatal sentence\r\nprevented. If the metropolitan of the Bishop of Beauvais, the\r\nArchbishop of Reims, had intervened in the trial, if he had suspended\r\nhis suffragan for abuse of authority, or some other reason, Pierre\r\nCauchon would have been greatly embarrassed; if, as he decided to do\r\nlater, King Charles VII had brought about the intervention of the\r\nmother and brothers of the Maid; if Jacques d'Arc and la Romee had\r\nprotested in due form against an action so manifestly one-sided; if\r\nthe register of Poitiers[107] had been sent for inclusion among the\r\ndocuments of the trial; if the high prelates subject to King Charles\r\nVII had asked for a safe conduct in order to come and give evidence in\r\nJeanne's favour at Rouen; finally, if the King, his Council, and the\r\nwhole Church of France had demanded an appeal to the Pope, as they\r\nwere legally entitled to do, then the trial might have had a different\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Even when the canons who took part in the trial are\r\nseverally considered. _Cf._ Ch. de Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur le\r\nproces de condamnation de Jeanne d'Arc_, Rouen, 1869, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Or at least the conclusions of the doctors which have\r\nbeen preserved. As for the register itself it could not have contained\r\nanything of great importance. From their evidence at the\r\nrehabilitation trial we see that the Poitiers clerks were not desirous\r\nfor much to be said of their inquiry.]\r\n\r\nBut they were afraid of the University of Paris. They feared lest\r\nJeanne might be after all what so many learned doctors maintained her\r\nto be, a heretic, a miscreant seduced by the prince of darkness. Satan\r\ntransforms himself into an angel of light, and it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish the true prophets from the false. The hapless Maid was\r\ndeserted by the very clergy whose croziers had so recently been\r\ncarried before her; of all the Poitiers masters not one was found to\r\ntestify in the chateau of Rouen to that innocence which they had\r\nofficially recognised eighteen months before.\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to trace the reputation of the Maid down\r\nthe ages. But to do so would require a whole book. I shall merely\r\nindicate the most striking revolutions of public opinion concerning\r\nher. The humanists of the Renaissance display no great interest in\r\nher: she was too Gothic for them. The Reformers, for whom she was\r\ntainted with idolatry, could not tolerate her picture.[108] It seems\r\nstrange to us to-day, but it is none the less certain, and in\r\nconformity with all we know of French feeling for royalty, that whilst\r\nthe monarchy endured it was the memory of Charles VII that kept alive\r\nthe memory of Jeanne d'Arc and saved her from oblivion.[109] Respect\r\ndue to the Prince generally hindered his faithful subjects from too\r\nclosely inquiring into the legends of Jeanne as well as into those of\r\nthe Holy Ampulla, the cures for King's evil, the _oriflamme_ and all\r\nother popular traditions relating to the antiquity and celebrity of\r\nthe royal throne of France. In 1609, when in a college of Paris, the\r\nMaid was the subject of sundry literary themes in which she was\r\nunfavourably treated,[110] a certain lawyer, Jean Hordal, who boasted\r\nthat he came of the same race as the heroine, complained of these\r\nacademic disputes as being derogatory to royal majesty--\"I am greatly\r\nastonished,\" he said, \"that ... public declamations against the honour\r\nof France, of King Charles VII and his Council,[111] should be\r\nsuffered in France.\" Had Jeanne not been so closely associated with\r\nroyalty, her memory would have been very much neglected by the wits of\r\nthe seventeenth century. In the minds of scholars, Catholics and\r\nProtestants alike, who considered the life of St. Margaret as mere\r\nsuperstition,[112] her apparitions did her harm. In those days even\r\nthe _Sorbonagres_ themselves were expurgating the martyrology and the\r\nlegends of saints. One of them, Edmond Richer, like Jeanne a native of\r\nChampagne, the censor of the university in 1600, and a zealous\r\nGallican, wrote an apology for the Maid who had defended the Crown of\r\nCharles VII[113] with her sword. Albeit a firm upholder of the\r\nliberties of the French Church, Edmond Richer was a good Catholic. He\r\nwas pious and of sound doctrine; he firmly believed in angels, but he\r\ndid not believe either in Saint Catherine or Saint Margaret, and their\r\nappearing to the Maid greatly embarrassed him. He solved the\r\ndifficulty by supposing that the angels had represented themselves to\r\nthe Maid as the two saints, whom in her ignorance she devoutly\r\nworshipped. The hypothesis seemed to him satisfactory, \"all the more\r\nso,\" he said, \"because the Spirit of God, which governs the Church,\r\naccommodates himself to our infirmity.\" Thirty or forty years later,\r\nanother doctor of the Sorbonne, Jean de Launoy, who was always\r\nferreting after saints, completed the discrediting of Saint\r\nCatherine's legend.[114] The voices of Domremy were falling into\r\ndisrepute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Aug.

It is none the less interesting to learn from him that he merely\r\ntreated his subject as an occasion for glorifying the Bastard of\r\nOrleans. He expressly says in his preface: \"I did not so much regard\r\nher (the Maid) as the chief character of the poem, who, strictly\r\nspeaking, is the Comte de Dunois.\" Chapelain was in the pay of the Duc\r\nde Longueville, a descendant of Dunois.[115] It is of Dunois that he\r\nsings; \"the illustrious shepherdess\" contributes the marvellous\r\nelement to his poem, and, according to the good man's own expression,\r\nfurnishes _les machines necessaires_ for an epic. Saint Catherine and\r\nSaint Margaret are too commonplace to be included among _ces\r\nmachines_. Chapelain tells us that he took particular care so to\r\narrange his poem that \"everything which happens in it by divine favour\r\nmight be believed to have taken place through human agency carried to\r\nthe highest degree to which nature is capable of ascending.\" Herein we\r\ndiscern the dawn of the modern spirit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Jean Chapelain, _La Pucelle ou la France delivree_,\r\nParis, 1656, in fol.]\r\n\r\nBossuet also is careful not to mention Saint Catherine and Saint\r\nMargaret. The four or five quarto pages which he devotes to Jeanne\r\nd'Arc in his \"Abrege de l'Histoire de France pour l'instruction du\r\nDauphin\"[116] are very interesting, not for his statement of facts,\r\nwhich is confused and inexact,[117] but for the care the author takes\r\nto represent the miraculous deeds attributed to Jeanne in an\r\nincidental and dubious manner. In Bossuet's opinion, as in Gerson's,\r\nthese things are matters of edification, not of faith. Writing for the\r\ninstruction of a prince, Bossuet was bound to abridge; but his\r\nabridgment goes too far when, representing Jeanne's condemnation to be\r\nthe work of the Bishop of Beauvais, he omits to say that the Bishop of\r\nBeauvais pronounced this sentence with the unanimous concurrence of\r\nthe University of Paris, and in conjunction with the Vice-Inquisitor.[118]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Oeuvres de messire Jacques-Benigne Bossuet_, Paris,\r\nin 4to, vol. xi, 1749, numbered pages; vol. xii, pp. 234 _et seq._ Cf.\r\nwhat he says of inspired persons in _l'Instruction sur les etats\r\nd'oraison_, Paris, 1697, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: \"This girl called Jeanne d'Arq ... had been a servant\r\nin an inn,\" _loc. cit._, p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: We must not be too severe on a tutor's note-books. But\r\nBossuet, who places the rehabilitation under the date 1431, does not\r\ntell us that it was only pronounced twenty-five years later. On the\r\ncontrary, as far as he is concerned, we might conclude that it\r\noccurred before the deliverance of Compiegne. The following are his\r\nwords: \"In execution of this sentence, she was burned alive at Rouen\r\nin 1431. The English spread the rumour that at the last she had\r\nadmitted the revelations which she had so loudly boasted to be false.\r\nBut some time afterwards the Pope appointed commissioners. Her trial\r\nwas solemnly revised and her conduct approved of by a final sentence\r\nwhich the Pope himself confirmed. The Burgundians were forced to raise\r\nthe siege of Compiegne,\" _loc. cit._ p. 236. Mezeray is more credulous\r\nthan Bossuet; he mentions \"the Saints Catherine and Margaret, who\r\npurified her soul with heavenly conversations, wherefore she venerated\r\nthem with a particular devotion.\" In relating the trial, he like\r\nBossuet, ignores the Vice-Inquisitor (_Histoire de France_, vol. ii,\r\n1746, in folio, pp. 11 _et seq._)]\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century philosophers did not descend on France like a\r\ncloud of locusts; they were the result of two centuries of the\r\ncritical spirit. If the story of Jeanne d'Arc contained too much\r\nmonkish superstition for their taste, it was because they had learned\r\ntheir ecclesiastical history from the Baillets and the Tillemonts, who\r\nwere pious indeed, but very critical of legends. Voltaire, writing of\r\nJeanne, jeered at the rascally monks and their dupes. But if we quote\r\nthe lines of _La Pucelle_, why not also the article[119] in the\r\n_Dictionnaire Philosophique_, which contains three pages of profounder\r\ntruth and nobler thought than certain voluminous modern works in which\r\nVoltaire is insulted in clerical jargon?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Voltaire ed. Beuchot, vol. xxvi. _Cf._ also _Essai sur\r\nles moeurs_, chap. lxxx. \"Finally, being accused of having once\r\nresumed man's dress, which had been left near her on purpose to tempt\r\nher, her judges ... declared her a relapsed heretic and caused to be\r\nburnt at the stake one who in heroic ages, when men erected altars to\r\ntheir liberators, would have had an altar raised to her for having\r\nserved her King. Afterwards Charles VII rehabilitated her memory,\r\nwhich her death itself had sufficiently honoured.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was precisely at the end of the eighteenth century that Jeanne\r\nbegan to be better known and more justly appreciated, first through a\r\nlittle book, which the Abbe Lenglet du Fresnoy derived almost wholly\r\nfrom the unpublished history of old Richer,[120] then by l'Averdy's\r\nerudite researches into the two trials.[121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: L'Abbe Lenglet du Fresnoy, _Histoire de Jeanne d'Arc,\r\nvierge, heroine et martyre d'Etat suscitee par la Providence pour\r\nretablir la monarchie francaise, tiree des proces et pieces originales\r\ndu temps_, Paris, 1753-1754, 3 vols. in 12mo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: F. de L'Averdy, _Memorial lu au comite des manuscrits\r\nconcernant la recherche a faire des minutes originales des differentes\r\naffaires qui ont eu lieu par rapport a Jeanne d'Arc, appelee\r\ncommunement la Pucelle d'Orleans_, Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1787, in\r\n4to; _Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliotheque du roi,\r\nlus au comite etabli par sa Majeste dans l'Academie royale des\r\nInscriptions et Belles Lettres_, Paris, Imp. Royale, 1790, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless humanism, and after humanism the Reformation, and after\r\nthe Reformation Cartesianism, and after Cartesianism experimental\r\nphilosophy had banished the old credulity from thoughtful minds. When\r\nthe Revolution came, the bloom had already long faded from the flower\r\nof Gothic legend. It seemed as if the glory of Jeanne d'Arc, so\r\nintimately related to the traditions of the royal house of France,\r\ncould not survive the monarchy, and as if the tempest which scattered\r\nthe royal ashes of Saint Denys and the treasure of Reims, would also\r\nbear away the frail relics and the venerated images of the saint of\r\nthe Valois. The new _regime_ did indeed refuse to honour a memory so\r\ninseparable from royalty and from religion. The festival of Jeanne\r\nd'Arc at Orleans, shorn of ecclesiastical pomp in 1791, was\r\ndiscontinued in 1793. Later the Maid's history appeared somewhat too\r\nGothic even to the _emigres_; Chateaubriand did not dare to introduce\r\nher into his \"Genie du Christianisme.\"[122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: \"Modern times present but two fine subjects for an epic\r\npoem, the Crusades and the Discovery of the New World\" (ed. 1802,\r\nParis, vol. ii, p. 7).]\r\n\r\nBut in the year XI the First Consul, who had just concluded the\r\nConcordat and was meditating the restoration of all the pageantry of\r\nthe coronation, reinstituted the festival of the Maid with its incense\r\nand its crosses. Glorified of old in Charles VII's letters to his good\r\ntowns, Jeanne was now exalted in _Le Moniteur_ by Bonaparte.[123]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: \"The illustrious Jeanne d'Arc has proved that there is\r\nno miracle which the French genius is incapable of working when\r\nnational independence is at stake\" (_Moniteur_ of 10 Pluviose, year\r\nXI, January 30, 1803).

[Original\r\ntaken from the Reiset collection.]]\r\n\r\nOnly by constant transformation do the figures of poetry and history\r\nlive in the minds of nations. Humanity cannot be interested in a\r\npersonage of old time unless it clothe it in its own sentiments and in\r\nits own passions. After having been associated with the monarchy of\r\ndivine right, the memory of Jeanne d'Arc came to be connected with\r\nthe national unity which that monarchy had rendered possible; in\r\nImperial and Republican France she became the symbol of _la patrie_.\r\nCertainly the daughter of Isabelle Romee had no more idea of _la\r\npatrie_ as it is conceived to-day than she had of the idea of landed\r\nproperty which lies at its base. She never imagined anything like what\r\nwe call the nation. That is something quite modern; but she did\r\nconceive of the heritage of kings and of the domain of the House of\r\nFrance. And it was there, in that domain and in that heritage, that\r\nthe French gathered together before forming themselves into _la\r\npatrie_.\r\n\r\nUnder influences which it is impossible for us exactly to discover,\r\nthe idea came to her of re-establishing the Dauphin in his\r\ninheritance; and this idea appeared to her so grand and so beautiful\r\nthat in the fulness of her very ingenuous pride, she believed it to\r\nhave been suggested to her by angels and saints from Paradise. For\r\nthis idea she gave her life. That is why she has survived the cause\r\nfor which she suffered. The very highest enterprises perish in their\r\ndefeat and even more surely in their victory. The devotion, which\r\ninspired them, remains as an immortal example. And if the illusion,\r\nunder which her senses laboured, helped her to this act of\r\nself-consecration, was not that illusion the unconscious outcome of\r\nher own heart? Her foolishness was wiser than wisdom, for it was that\r\nfoolishness of martyrdom, without which men have never yet founded\r\nanything great or useful. Cities, empires, republics rest on\r\nsacrifice. It is not without reason therefore, not without justice\r\nthat, transformed by enthusiastic imagination, she became the symbol\r\nof _la patrie_ in arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, Le Brun de Charmettes,[124] a royalist jealous of imperial\r\nglory, wrote the first patriotic history of Jeanne d'Arc. The history\r\nis an able work. It has been followed by many others, conceived in the\r\nsame spirit, composed on the same plan, written in the same style.\r\nFrom 1841 to 1849, Jules Quicherat, by his publication of the two\r\ntrials and the evidence, worthily opened an incomparable period of\r\nresearch and discovery. At the same time, Michelet in the fifth volume\r\nof his \"Histoire de France,\" wrote pages of high colour and rapid\r\nmovement, which will doubtless remain the highest expression of the\r\nromantic art as applied to the Maid.[125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Le Brun de Charmettes, _Histoire de Jeanne d'Arc\r\nsurnommee la Pucelle d'Orleans_, Paris, 1817, 4 vols. in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Michelet, _Histoire de France_, vol. v.]\r\n\r\nBut of all the histories written between 1817 and 1870, or at least of\r\nall those with which I have made acquaintance, for I have not\r\nattempted to read them all, the most discerning in my opinion is the\r\nfourth book of Vallet de Viriville's \"Histoire de Charles VII\" in\r\nwhich his chief preoccupation is to place the Maid in that group of\r\nvisionaries to which she really belongs.[126]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, Paris, 1863, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nWallon's book has been widely circulated if not widely read. A\r\nmonotonous, conscientious work moderately enthusiastic, it owes its\r\nsuccess to its unimpeachable exactitude.[127] If there must be an\r\northodox Jeanne d'Arc to suit fashionable persons, then for such a\r\npurpose, M. Marius Sepet's representation of the Maid would be equally\r\nexact and more graceful.[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: H. Wallon, _Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 1860, 2 vols. in\r\n8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: M. Sepet, _Jeanne d'Arc_, with an introduction by Leon\r\nGautier, Tours, 1869, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nAfter the war of 1871, the twofold influence of the patriotic spirit,\r\nexalted by defeat, and the revival of Catholicism among the middle\r\nclass gave a new impetus to admiration of the Maid. Arts and letters\r\ncompleted the transfiguration of Jeanne.\r\n\r\nCatholics, like the learned Canon Dunand,[129] vie in zeal and\r\nenthusiasm with free-thinking idealists like M. Joseph Fabre.[130] By\r\nreproducing the two trials in a very artistic manner, in modern French\r\nand in a direct form of speech, M. Fabre has popularised the most\r\nancient and the most touching impression of the Maid.[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Chanoine Dunand, _Histoire de Jeanne d'Arc_, Toulouse,\r\n1898-1899, 3 vols. in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Joseph Fabre, _Jeanne d'Arc liberatrice de la France_,\r\nnew edition, Paris, 1894, in 12mo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Proces de condamnation de Jeanne d'Arc...._,\r\ntranslated with commentary by J. Fabre, new edition, Paris, 1895, in\r\n18mo.]\r\n\r\nFrom this period date almost innumerable works of erudition, among\r\nwhich must be noted those of Simeon Luce, which henceforth no one who\r\nwould treat of Jeanne's early years can afford to neglect.[132]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, _op. cit._; _La France\r\npendant la guerre de Cent Ans_, _op. cit._]\r\n\r\nWe are equally indebted to M. Germain Lefevre-Pontalis for his fine\r\neditions and his discerning studies so eruditely graceful and exact.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period of romantic and Neo-Catholic enthusiasm the\r\narts of painting and sculpture produced numerous representations of\r\nJeanne, which had hitherto been very rare. Now everywhere were to be\r\nfound Jeanne in armour and on horseback, Jeanne in prayer, Jeanne in\r\ncaptivity, Jeanne suffering martyrdom. Of all these images expressing\r\nin different manners and with varying merit the taste and the\r\nsentiment of the period, one work only appears great and true, and of\r\nstriking beauty: Rude's Jeanne d'Arc beholding a vision.[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Lanery d'Arc, _Le livre d'Or de Jeanne d'Arc_, Nos.\r\n2080 to 2112.]\r\n\r\nThe word _patrie_ did not exist in the days of the Maid. People spoke\r\nof the kingdom of France.[134] No one, not even jurists, knew exactly\r\nwhat were its limits, which were constantly changing. The diversity of\r\nlaws and customs was infinite, and quarrels between nobles were\r\nconstantly arising. Nevertheless, men felt in their hearts that they\r\nloved their native land and hated the foreigner. If the Hundred Years'\r\nWar did not create the sentiment of nationality in France, it fostered\r\nit. In his \"Quadrilogue Invectif\" Alain Chartier represents France,\r\nindicated by her robe sumptuously adorned with the emblems of the\r\nnobility, of the clergy and of the _tiers etat_, but lamentably soiled\r\nand torn, adjuring the three orders not to permit her to perish.\r\n\"After the bond of the Catholic faith,\" she says to them, \"Nature has\r\ncalled you before all things to unite for the salvation of your native\r\nland, and for the defence of that lordship under which God has caused\r\nyou to be born and to live.\"[135] And these are not the mere maxims of\r\na humourist versed in the virtues of antiquity. On the hearts of\r\nhumble Frenchmen it was laid to serve the country of their birth.\r\n\"Must the King be driven from his kingdom, and must we become\r\nEnglish?\" cried a man-at-arms of Lorraine in 1428.[136] The subjects\r\nof the Lilies, as well as those of the Leopard, felt it incumbent\r\nupon them to be loyal to their liege lord. But if any change for the\r\nworse occurred in the lordships to which they belonged, they were\r\nquite ready to make the best of it, because a lordship must increase\r\nor decrease, according to power and fortune, according to the good\r\nright or the good pleasure of the holder; it may be dismembered by\r\nmarriages, or gifts, or inheritance, or alienated by various\r\ncontracts. On the occasion of the Treaty of Bretigny, which seriously\r\nnarrowed the dominions of King John, the folk of Paris strewed the\r\nstreets with grass and flowers as a sign of rejoicing.[137] As a\r\nmatter of fact, nobles changed their allegiance as often as it was\r\nnecessary. Juvenal des Ursins relates in his Journal[138] how at the\r\ntime of the English conquest of Normandy, a young widow was known to\r\nquit her domain with her three children in order to escape doing\r\nhomage to the King from beyond the seas. But how many Norman nobles\r\nwere like her in refusing to swear fealty to the former enemies of the\r\nkingdom? The example of fidelity to the king was not always set by\r\nthose of his own family. The Duke of Bourbon, in the name of all the\r\nprinces of the blood royal, prisoners with him in the hands of the\r\nEnglish, proposed to Henry V that they should go and negotiate in\r\nFrance for the cession of Harfleur, promising that if the Royal\r\nCouncil met them with refusal they would acknowledge Henry V to be\r\nKing of France.[139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: A. Thomas, _Le mot \"Patrie\" et Jeanne d'Arc_ in _Revue\r\ndes Idees_, July 15, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _Les oeuvres de Maistre Alain Chartier_, published by\r\nAndre Duchesne, Paris, 1642, in 4to, p. 410.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 436. See _post_, vol. i, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Froissart, _Chroniques_, book i, chap. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Jean Juvenal des Ursins in Buchon, _Choix des\r\nChroniques_, iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Rymer, _Foedera_, vol. ix, p. 427.]\r\n\r\nEvery one thought first of himself. Whoever possessed land owed\r\nhimself to his land; his neighbour was his enemy. The burgher thought\r\nonly of his town. The peasant changed his master without knowing it.\r\nThe three orders were not yet united closely enough to form, in the\r\nmodern sense of the word, a state.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the royal power united the French. This union became\r\nstronger in proportion as royalty grew more powerful. In the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, that desire to think and act in common,\r\nwhich creates great nations, became very strong among us--at least in\r\nthose families which furnished officers to the Crown--and it even\r\nspread among the lower orders of society. Rabelais introduces Francois\r\nVillon and the King of England into a tale so inflamed with military\r\nbravado that it might have been told over the camp fire in an almost\r\nidentical manner by one of Napoleon's grenadiers.[140] In his preface\r\nto the poem we have just quoted, Chapelain writes of the occasions\r\nwhen \"_la patrie_ who is our common mother, has need of all her\r\nchildren.\" Already the old poet expresses himself like the author of\r\nthe _Marseillaise_.[141]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Pantagruel_, book iv, chap. lxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _La Pucelle_, Preface.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the feeling for _la patrie_ did exist under\r\nthe old _regime_. The impulse imparted to this sentiment by the\r\nRevolution was none the less immense. It added to it the idea of\r\nnational unity and national territorial integrity. It extended to all\r\nthe right of property hitherto reserved to a small number, and thus,\r\nso to speak, divided _la patrie_ among the citizens. While rendering\r\nthe peasant capable of possessing, the new _regime_ imposed upon him\r\nthe obligations of defending his actual or potential possessions.\r\nRecourse to arms is a necessity alike for whomsoever acquires or\r\nwishes to acquire territory. Hardly had the Frenchman come to enjoy\r\nthe rights of a man and of a citizen, hardly had he entered into\r\npossession or thought he might enter into possession of a home and\r\nlands of his own, when the armies of the Coalition arrived \"to drive\r\nhim back to ancient slavery.\" Then the patriot became a soldier.\r\nTwenty-three years of warfare, with the inevitable alternations of\r\nvictories and defeats, built up our fathers in their love of _la\r\npatrie_ and their hatred of the foreigner.\r\n\r\nSince then, as the result of industrial progress, there have arisen in\r\none country and another, rivalries which are every day growing more\r\nbitter. The present methods of production by multiplying antagonism\r\namong nations, have given rise to imperialism, to colonial expansion\r\nand to armed peace.\r\n\r\nBut how many contrary forces are at work in this formidable creation\r\nof a new order of things! In all countries the great development of\r\ntrade and manufactures has given birth to a new class. This class,\r\npossessing nothing, having no hope of ever possessing anything,\r\nenjoying none of the good things of life, not even the light of day,\r\ndoes not share the fear which haunted the peasant and burgher of the\r\nRevolution, of being despoiled by an enemy coming from abroad; the\r\nmembers of this new class, having no wealth to defend, regard foreign\r\nnations with neither terror nor hatred. At the same time over all the\r\nmarkets of the world there have arisen financial powers, which,\r\nalthough they often affect respect for old traditions, are by their\r\nvery functions essentially destructive of the national and patriotic\r\nspirit. The universal capitalist system has created in France, as\r\neverywhere else, the internationalism of the workers and the\r\ncosmopolitanism of the financiers.\r\n\r\nTo-day, just as two thousand years ago, in order to discern the\r\nfuture, we must regard not the enterprises of the great but the\r\nconfused movements of the working classes. The nations will not\r\nindefinitely endure this armed peace which weighs so heavily upon\r\nthem. Every day we behold the organising of an universal community of\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nI believe in the future union of nations, and I long for it with that\r\nardent charity for the human race, which, formed in the Latin\r\nconscience in the days of Epictetus and Seneca, and through so many\r\ncenturies extinguished by European barbarism, has been revived in the\r\nnoblest breasts of modern times. And in vain will it be argued against\r\nme that these are the mere dream-illusions of desire: it is desire\r\nthat creates life and the future is careful to realise the dreams of\r\nphilosophers. Nevertheless, that we to-day are assured of a peace that\r\nnothing will disturb, none but a madman would maintain. On the\r\ncontrary, the terrible industrial and commercial rivalries growing up\r\naround us indicate future conflicts, and there is nothing to assure us\r\nthat France will not one day find herself involved in a great European\r\nor world conflagration. Her obligation to provide for her defence\r\nincreases not a little those difficulties which arise from a social\r\norder profoundly agitated by competition in production and antagonism\r\nbetween classes.\r\n\r\nAn absolute empire obtains its defenders by inspiring fear; democracy\r\nonly by bestowing benefits. Fear or interest lies at the root of all\r\ndevotion. If the French proletariat is to defend the Republic\r\nheroically in the hour of peril, then it must either be happy or have\r\nthe hope of becoming so. And what use is it to deceive ourselves? The\r\nlot of the workman to-day is no better in France than in Germany, and\r\nnot so good as in England or America.\r\n\r\nOn these important subjects I have not been able to forbear expressing\r\nthe truth as it appears to me; there is a great satisfaction in saying\r\nwhat one believes useful and just.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for me to submit to my readers a few reflections\r\non the difficult art of writing history, and to explain certain\r\npeculiarities of form and language which will be found in this work.\r\n\r\nTo enter into the spirit of a period that has passed away, to make\r\noneself the contemporary of men of former days, deliberate study and\r\nloving care are necessary. The difficulty lies not so much in what one\r\nmust know as in what one must not know. If we would really live in the\r\nfifteenth century, how many things we must forget: knowledge, methods,\r\nall those acquisitions which make moderns of us. We must forget that\r\nthe earth is round, and that the stars are suns, and not lamps\r\nsuspended from a crystal vault; we must forget the cosmogony of\r\nLaplace, and believe in the science of Saint Thomas, of Dante, and of\r\nthose cosmographers of the Middle Age who teach the Creation in seven\r\ndays and the foundation of kingdoms by the sons of Priam, after the\r\ndestruction of Great Troy. Such and such a historian or paleographer\r\nis powerless to make us understand the contemporaries of the Maid. It\r\nis not knowledge he lacks, but ignorance--ignorance of modern warfare,\r\nof modern politics, of modern religion.\r\n\r\nBut when we have forgotten, as far as possible, all that has happened\r\nsince the youth of Charles VII, in order to think like a clerk in\r\nexile at Poitiers, or a burgher at Orleans serving on the ramparts of\r\nhis city, we must recover all our intellectual resources in order to\r\nembrace the entirety of events, and discover that sequence between\r\ncause and effect which escape the clerk or the burgher. \"I have\r\ncontracted my horizon,\" says the Chatterton of Alfred de Vigny, when\r\nhe explains how he is conscious of nothing that has happened since the\r\ndays of the old Saxons. But Chatterton wrote poems, pseudo chronicles,\r\nand not history. The historian must alternately contract his horizon\r\nand widen it. If he undertake to tell an old story, he must needs\r\nsuccessively--or sometimes at one and the same moment--assume the\r\ncredulity of the folk he restores to life, and the discernment of the\r\nmost accomplished critic. By a strange process, he must divide his\r\npersonality. He must be at once the ancient man and the modern man; he\r\nmust live on two different planes, like that curious character in a\r\nstory by Mr. H.G. Wells, who lives and moves in a little English town,\r\nand all the time sees herself at the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nI have carefully visited cities and countries in which the events I\r\npropose to relate took place. I have seen the valley of the Meuse\r\namidst the flowers and perfumes of spring, and I have seen it again\r\nbeneath a mass of mist and cloud. I have travelled along the smiling\r\nbanks of the Loire, so full of renown; through La Beauce, with its\r\nvast horizons bordered with snow-topped mountains; through\r\nl'Ile-de-France, where the sky is serene; through La Champagne, with\r\nits stony hills covered with those low vines which, trampled upon by\r\nthe coronation army, bloomed again into leaves and fruit, says the\r\nlegend, and by St. Martin's Day yielded a late but rich vintage.[142]\r\nI have lingered in barren Picardy, along the Bay of the Somme so sad\r\nand bare beneath the flight of its birds of passage. I have wandered\r\nthrough the fat meadows of Normandy to Rouen with its steeples and\r\ntowers, its ancient charnel houses, its damp streets, its last\r\nremaining timbered houses with high gables. I have imagined these\r\nrivers, these lands, these chateaux and these towns as they were five\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Germain Lefevre-Pontalis, _Les sources allemandes de\r\nl'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 93.]\r\n\r\nI have accustomed my gaze to the forms assumed by the beings and the\r\nobjects of those days. I have examined all that remains of stone, of\r\niron, or of wood worked by the hands of those old artisans, who were\r\nfreer and consequently more ingenious than ours, and whose handicraft\r\nreveals a desire to animate and adorn everything. To the best of my\r\nability I have studied figures carved and painted, not exactly in\r\nFrance--for there, in those days of misery and death, art was little\r\npractised--but in Flanders, in Burgundy, in Provence, where the\r\nworkmanship is often in a style at once affected and _naif_, and\r\nfrequently beautiful. As I gazed at the old miniatures, they seemed to\r\nlive before me, and I saw the nobles in the absurd magnificence of\r\ntheir _etoffes a tripes_,[143] the dames and the damoiselles somewhat\r\ndevilish with their horned caps and their pointed shoes; clerks seated\r\nat the desk, men-at-arms riding their chargers and merchants their\r\nmules, husbandmen performing from April till March all the tasks of\r\nthe rural calendar; peasant women, whose broad coifs are still worn by\r\nnuns. I drew near to these folk, who were our fellows, and who yet\r\ndiffered from us by a thousand shades of sentiment and of thought; I\r\nlived their lives; I read their hearts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Imitation velvet.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that there exists no authentic\r\nrepresentation of Jeanne. In the art of the fifteenth century all that\r\nrelates to her amounts to very little: hardly anything remains--a\r\nsmall piece of _bestion_ tapestry, a slight pen-and-ink figure on a\r\nregister, a few illuminations in manuscripts of the reigns of Charles\r\nVII, Louis XI, and Charles VIII, that is all. I have found it\r\nnecessary to contribute to this very meagre iconography of Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, not because I had anything to add to it, but in order to\r\nexpunge the contributions of the forgers of that period. In Appendix\r\nIV, at the end of this work, will be found the short article in which\r\nI point out the forgeries which, for the most part, are already old,\r\nbut had not been previously denounced. I have limited my researches to\r\nthe fifteenth century, leaving to others the task of studying those\r\npictures of the Renaissance in which the Maid appears decked out in\r\nthe German fashion, with the plumed hat and slashed doubtlet of a\r\nSaxon ritter or a Swiss mercenary.[144] I cannot say who served as a\r\nprototype for these portraits, but they closely resemble the woman\r\naccompanying the mercenaries in _La Danse des morts_, which Nicholas\r\nManuel painted at Berne, on the wall of the Dominican Monastery,\r\nbetween 1515 and 1521.[145] In _le Grand Siecle_ Jeanne d'Arc becomes\r\nClorinda, Minerva, Bellona in ballet costume.[146]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: See the picture of 1581, preserved in the Orleans\r\nMuseum and reproduced in Wallon's _Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 466.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: _La Danse des Morts_, painted at Berne between 1515 and\r\n1520 by Nicolas Manuel, lithographed by Guillaume Stettler, s.d. in\r\nfolio oblong, engraving xx. M. Salomon Reinach believes this prototype\r\nmay be found in the Judiths of Cranach.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Lanery d'Arc, _Le livre d'Or de Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nIconography, Nos. 2080-2112.]\r\n\r\nTo my mind a continuous story is more likely than any controversy or\r\ndiscussion to make my subject live, and bring home its verities to my\r\nreaders. It is true that the documents relating to the Maid do not\r\nlend themselves very easily to this kind of treatment. As I have just\r\nshown, they may nearly all be regarded as doubtful from several points\r\nof view, and objections to them arise at every moment. Nevertheless, I\r\nthink that by making a cautious and judicious use of these documents\r\none may obtain material sufficient for a truthful history of\r\nconsiderable extent. Besides, I have always indicated the sources of\r\nmy facts, so that every one may judge for himself of the\r\ntrustworthiness of my authorities.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my story I have related many incidents which, without\r\nhaving a direct relation to Jeanne, reveal the spirit, the morals, and\r\nthe beliefs of her time. These incidents are usually of a religious\r\norder. They must necessarily be so, for Jeanne's story--and I cannot\r\nrepeat it too often--is the story of a saint, just like that of\r\nColette of Corbie, or of Catherine of Sienna.\r\n\r\nI have yielded frequently, perhaps too frequently, to the desire to\r\nmake the reader live among the men and things of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. And in order not to distract him suddenly from them, I have\r\navoided suggesting any comparison with other periods, although many\r\nsuch occurred to me.\r\n\r\nMy history is founded on the form and substance of ancient documents;\r\nbut I have hardly ever introduced into it literal quotations; I\r\nbelieve that unless it possesses a certain unity of language a book\r\nis unreadable, and I want to be read.\r\n\r\nIt is neither affectation of style nor artistic taste that has led me\r\nto adhere as far as possible to the tone of the period and to prefer\r\narchaic forms of language whenever I thought they would be\r\nintelligible, it is because ideas are changed when words are changed\r\nand because one cannot substitute modern for ancient expressions\r\nwithout altering sentiments and characters.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to make my style simple and familiar. History is\r\ntoo often written in a high-flown manner that renders it wearisome and\r\nfalse. Why should we imagine historical facts to be out of the\r\nordinary run of things and on a scale different from every-day\r\nhumanity?\r\n\r\nThe writer of a history such as this is terribly tempted to throw\r\nhimself into the battle. There is hardly a modern account of these old\r\ncontests, in which the author, be he ecclesiastic or professor, does\r\nnot with pen behind ear, rush into the _melee_ by the side of the\r\nMaid. Even at the risk of missing the revelation of some of the\r\nbeauties of her nature, I deem it better to keep one's own personality\r\nout of the action.\r\n\r\nI have written this history with a zeal ardent and tranquil; I have\r\nsought truth strenuously, I have met her fearlessly. Even when she\r\nassumed an unexpected aspect, I have not turned from her. I shall be\r\nreproached for audacity, until I am reproached for timidity.\r\n\r\nI have pleasure in expressing my gratitude to my illustrious\r\n_confreres_, MM. Paul Meyer and Ernest Lavisse, who have given me\r\nvaluable advice. I owe much to M. Petit Dutaillis for certain kindly\r\nobservations which I have taken into consideration. I am also greatly\r\nindebted to M. Henri Jadart, Secretary of the Reims Academy; M. E.\r\nLanglois, Professor at the Faculte des Lettres of Lille; M. Camille\r\nBloch, some time archivist of Loiret, M. Noel Charavay, autographic\r\nexpert, and M. Raoul Bonnet.\r\n\r\nM. Pierre Champion, who albeit still young is already known as the\r\nauthor of valuable historical works, has placed the result of his\r\nresearches at my disposal with a disinterestedness I shall never be\r\nable adequately to acknowledge. He has also carefully read the whole\r\nof my work. M. Jean Brousson has given me the advantage of his\r\nperspicacity which far surpasses what one is entitled to expect from\r\none's secretary.\r\n\r\nIn the century which I have endeavoured to represent in this work,\r\nthere was a fiend, by name Titivillus. Every evening this fiend put\r\ninto a sack all the letters omitted or altered by the copyists during\r\nthe day. He carried them to hell, in order that, when Saint Michael\r\nweighed the souls of these negligent scribes, the share of each one\r\nmight be put in the scale of his iniquities. Should he have survived\r\nthe invention of printing, surely this most properly meticulous fiend\r\nmust to-day be assuming the heavy task of collecting the misprints\r\nscattered throughout the books which aspire to exactitude; it would be\r\nvery foolish of him to trouble about others. As occasion requires he\r\nwill place those misprints to the account of reader or author. I am\r\ninfinitely indebted to my publishers and friends MM. Calmann, Levy and\r\nto their excellent collaborators for the care and experience they have\r\nemployed in lightening the burden, which Titivillus will place on my\r\nback on the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL.

Now they wind in sudden bends, now in gradual\r\ncurves, for ever breaking up into narrow streams, and then the threads\r\nof greenish waters gather together again, or here and there are\r\nsuddenly lost to sight underground. In the summer the river is a lazy\r\nstream, barely bending in its course the reeds which grow upon its\r\nshallow bed; and from the bank one may watch its lapping waters kept\r\nback by clumps of rushes scarcely covering a little sand and moss. But\r\nin the season of heavy rains, swollen by sudden torrents, deeper and\r\nmore rapid, as it rushes along, it leaves behind it on the banks a\r\nkind of dew, which rises in pools of clear water on a level with the\r\ngrass of the valley.\r\n\r\nThis valley, two or three miles broad, stretches unbroken between low\r\nhills, softly undulating, crowned with oaks, maples, and birches.\r\nAlthough strewn with wild-flowers in the spring, it looks severe,\r\ngrave, and sometimes even sad. The green grass imparts to it a\r\nmonotony like that of stagnant water. Even on fine days one is\r\nconscious of a hard, cold climate. The sky seems more genial than the\r\nearth. It beams upon it with a tearful smile; it constitutes all the\r\nmovement, the grace, the exquisite charm of this delicate tranquil\r\nlandscape. Then when winter comes the sky merges with the earth in a\r\nkind of chaos. Fogs come down thick and clinging. The white light\r\nmists, which in summer veil the bottom of the valley, give place to\r\nthick clouds and dark moving mountains, but slowly scattered by a red,\r\ncold sun. Wanderers ranging the uplands in the early morning might\r\ndream with the mystics in their ecstasy that they are walking on\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nThus, after having passed on the left the wooded plateau, from the\r\nheight of which the chateau of Bourlemont dominates the valley of the\r\nSaonelle, and on the right Coussey with its old church, the winding\r\nriver flows between le Bois Chesnu on the west and the hill of Julien\r\non the east. Then on it goes, passing the adjacent villages of Domremy\r\nand Greux on the west bank and separating Greux from Maxey-sur-Meuse.\r\nAmong other hamlets nestling in the hollows of the hills or rising on\r\nthe high ground, it passes Burey-la-Cote, Maxey-sur-Vaise, and\r\nBurey-en-Vaux, and flows on to water the beautiful meadows of\r\nVaucouleurs.[147]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: J. Ch. Chappellier, _Etude historique et geographique\r\nsur Domremy, pays de Jeanne d'Arc_, Saint-Die, 1890, in 8vo. E.\r\nHinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 1894, in 18mo.]\r\n\r\nIn this little village of Domremy, situated at least seven and a half\r\nmiles further down the river than Neufchateau and twelve and a half\r\nabove Vaucouleurs, there was born, about the year 1410 or 1412,[148]\r\na girl who was destined to live a remarkable life. She was born poor.\r\nHer father,[149] Jacques or Jacquot d'Arc, a native of the village of\r\nCeffonds in Champagne,[150] was a small farmer and himself drove his\r\nhorses at the plough.[151] His neighbours, men and women alike, held\r\nhim to be a good Christian and an industrious workman.[152] His wife\r\ncame from Vouthon, a village nearly four miles northwest of Domremy,\r\nbeyond the woods of Greux. Her name being Isabelle or Zabillet, she\r\nreceived at some time, exactly when is uncertain, the surname of\r\nRomee.[153] That name was given to those who had been to Rome or on\r\nsome other important pilgrimage;[154] and it is possible that Isabelle\r\nmay have acquired her name of Romee by assuming the pilgrim's shell\r\nand staff.[155] One of her brothers was a parish priest, another a\r\ntiler; she had a nephew who was a carpenter.[156] She had already\r\nborne her husband three children: Jacques or Jacquemin, Catherine, and\r\nJean.[157]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: This may be inferred from vol. i, p. 46, of the\r\n_Trial_. But Jeanne did not know how old she was when she left her\r\nfather's house (_Trial_, vol. i, p. 51). I have ignored the letter of\r\nPerceval de Boulainvilliers, p. 116, vol. v, of the _Trial_.

It\r\nis said that in those days and in that country the form of exorcism\r\npronounced by the priest during the baptismal ceremony was much longer\r\nfor girls than for boys.[159] We do not know whether Messire Jean\r\nMinet,[160] the parish priest, pronounced it over the child in all its\r\nliteral fulness, but we notice the custom as one of the numerous signs\r\nof the Church's invincible mistrust of woman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 393, _passim_. S. Luce, _Jeanne\r\nd'Arc a Domremy_, vol. xvi, p. 357.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: A. Monteil, _Histoire des Francais_, 1853, in 18mo,\r\nvol. ii, p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 46. Jean Minet was a native of\r\nNeufchateau.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom then prevailing the child had several\r\ngodfathers and godmothers.[161] The men-gossips were Jean Morel, of\r\nGreux,[162] husbandman; Jean Barrey, of Neufchateau; Jean Le Langart\r\nor Lingui, and Jean Rainguesson; the women, Jeannette, wife of\r\nThevenin le Royer, called Roze, of Domremy; Beatrix, wife of\r\nEstellin,[163] husbandman in the same village; Edite, wife of Jean\r\nBarrey; Jeanne, wife of Aubrit, called Jannet and described as Maire\r\nAubrit when he was appointed secretary to the lords of Bourlemont;\r\nJeannette, wife of Thiesselin de Vittel, a scholar of Neufchateau. She\r\nwas the most learned of all, for she had heard stories read out of\r\nbooks. Among the godmothers there are mentioned also the wife of\r\nNicolas d'Arc, Jacques' brother, and two obscure Christians, one\r\ncalled Agnes, the other Sibylle.[164] Here, as in every group of good\r\nCatholics, we have a number of Jeans, Jeannes, and Jeannettes. St.\r\nJohn the Baptist was a saint of high repute; his festival, kept on the\r\n24th of June, was a red-letter day in the calendar, both civil and\r\nreligious; it marked the customary date for leases, hirings, and\r\ncontracts of all kinds. In the opinion of certain ecclesiastics,\r\nespecially of the mendicant orders, St. John the Evangelist, whose\r\nhead had rested on the Saviour's breast and who was to return to earth\r\nwhen the ages should have run their course, was the greatest saint in\r\nParadise.[165] Wherefore, in honour of the Precursor of the Saviour\r\nor of his best beloved disciple, when babes were baptised the name\r\nJean or Jeanne was frequently preferred to all others. To render these\r\nholy names more in keeping with the helplessness of childhood and the\r\nhumble destiny awaiting most of us, they were given the diminutive\r\nforms of Jeannot and Jeannette. On the banks of the Meuse the peasants\r\nhad a particular liking for these diminutives at once unpretentious\r\nand affectionate: Jacquot, Pierrollot, Zabillet, Mengette,\r\nGuillemette.[166] After the wife of the scholar, Thiesselin, the child\r\nwas named Jeannette. That was the name by which she was known in the\r\nvillage. Later, in France, she was called Jeanne.[167]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: J. Corblet, _Parrains et marraines_, in _Revue de l'art\r\nchretien_, 1881, vol. xiv, pp. 336 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Simeon Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, proofs and\r\nillustrations, li, p. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: _Ibid._, p. clxxix, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Cf. _Trial_, index, under _parrains_ and _marraines_.\r\nIt is not always possible to assign to these personages the names they\r\nbore and the position they occupied at the exact date when they are\r\nintroduced.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in the _Revue\r\nHistorique_, vol. iv, p. 342.

Henri Lepage, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\nest-elle Lorraine?_ Nancy, 1852, pp. 57-79.]\r\n\r\nShe was brought up in her father's house, in Jacques' poor\r\ndwelling.[168] In the front there were two windows admitting but a\r\nscanty light. The stone roof forming one side of a gable on the garden\r\nside sloped almost to the ground. Close by the door, as was usual in\r\nthat country, were the dung-heap, a pile of firewood, and the farm\r\ntools covered with rust and mud. But the humble enclosure, which\r\nserved as orchard and kitchen-garden, in the spring bloomed in a\r\nwealth of pink and white flowers.[169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 244 _et seq._ Jacques d'Arc's\r\nhouse doubtless looked on to the road; the Du Lys, or rather the\r\nThiesselins, pulled it down and erected in its place a house no longer\r\nexisting. The shields which ornamented its facade have been placed\r\nupon the door of the building now shown as Jeanne's house. What is\r\nrepresented as Jeanne's room is the bakehouse (E. Hinzelin, _Chez\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 74). See an article by Henri Arsac in _L'echo de\r\nl'Est_, 26 July, 1890. A whole literature has been written on this\r\nsubject (Lanery d'Arc, _Livre d'or_, pp. 330 _et seq._).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: Emile Hinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThese good Christians had one more child, the youngest, Pierre, who\r\nwas called Pierrelot.[170]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 151, 220.]\r\n\r\nFed on light wine and brown bread, hardened by a hard life, Jeanne\r\ngrew up in an unfruitful land, among people who were rough and sober.\r\nShe lived in perfect liberty. Among hard-working peasants the children\r\nare left to themselves. Isabelle's daughter seems to have got on well\r\nwith the village children.\r\n\r\nA little neighbour, Hauviette, three or four years younger than she,\r\nwas her daily companion. They liked to sleep together in the same\r\nbed.[171] Mengette, whose parents lived close by, used to come and\r\nspin at Jacques d'Arc's house. She helped Jeanne with her household\r\nduties.[172] Taking her distaff with her, Jeanne used often to go and\r\npass the evening at Saint-Amance, at the house of a husbandman\r\nJacquier, who had a young daughter.[173] Boys and girls grew up as a\r\nmatter of course side by side. Being neighbours, Jeanne and Simonin\r\nMusnier's son were brought up together. When Musnier's son was still a\r\nchild he fell ill, and Jeanne nursed him.[174]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 417: \"_Jacuit amorose in domo\r\npatris sui._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Ibid._, p. 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: _Ibid._, p. 408.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: _Ibid._, p. 423.]\r\n\r\nIn those days it was not unprecedented for village maidens to know\r\ntheir letters. A few years earlier Maitre Jean Gerson had counselled\r\nhis sisters, peasants of Champagne, to learn to read, and had\r\npromised, if they succeeded, to give them edifying books.[175] Albeit\r\nthe niece of a parish priest, Jeanne did not learn her horn-book, thus\r\nresembling most of the village children, but not all, for at Maxey\r\nthere was a school attended by boys from Domremy.[176]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: E.

Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_,\r\ndocument in facsimile xiii.]\r\n\r\nFrom her mother she learnt the Paternoster, Ave Maria, and the\r\ncredo.[177] She heard a few beautiful stories of the saints. That was\r\nher whole education. On holy days, in the nave of the church, beneath\r\nthe pulpit, while the men stood round the wall, she, in the manner of\r\nthe peasant women, squatted on her toes, listening to the priest's\r\nsermon.[178]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 46, 47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 402. See in Montfaucon's\r\n_Monuments de la Monarchie Francaise_, vol. iii, the second miniature,\r\nthe \"Douze perils d'enfer\" (the twelve perils of hell).]\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was old enough she laboured in the fields, weeding,\r\ndigging, and, like the Lorraine maidens of to-day, doing the work of a\r\nman.[179]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 409, 415, 420.]\r\n\r\nThe river meadows were the chief source of wealth to the dwellers on\r\nthe banks of the Meuse. When the hay harvest was over, according to\r\nhis share of the arable land, each villager in Domremy had the right\r\nto turn so many head of cattle into the meadows of the village. Each\r\nfamily took its turn at watching the flocks and herds in the meadows.\r\nJacques d'Arc, who had a little grazing land of his own, turned out\r\nhis oxen and his horses with the others. When his turn came to watch\r\nthem, he delegated the task to his daughter Jeanne, who went off into\r\nthe meadow, distaff in hand.[180]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 51, 66; vol. ii, p. 404. S. Luce,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. lij.]\r\n\r\nBut she would rather do housework or sew or spin. She was pious. She\r\nswore neither by God nor his saints; and to assert the truth of\r\nanything she was content to say: \"There's no mistake.\"[181] When the\r\nbells rang for the _Angelus_, she crossed herself and knelt.[182] On\r\nSaturday, the Holy Virgin's day, she climbed the hill overgrown with\r\ngrass, vines, and fruit-trees, with the village of Greux nestling at\r\nits foot, and gained the wooded plateau, whence she could see on the\r\neast the green valley and the blue hills. On the brow of the hill,\r\nbarely two and a half miles from the village, in a shaded dale full of\r\nmurmuring sounds, from beneath beeches, ash-trees, and oaks gush forth\r\nthe clear waters of the Saint-Thiebault spring, which cure fevers and\r\nheal wounds. Above the spring rises the chapel of Notre-Dame de\r\nBermont. In fine weather it is pervaded by the scent of fields and\r\nwoods, and winter wraps this high ground in a mantle of sadness and\r\nsilence. In those days, clothed in a royal cloak and wearing a crown,\r\nwith her divine child in her arms, Notre-Dame de Bermont received the\r\nprayers and the offerings of young men and maidens. She worked\r\nmiracles. Jeanne used to visit her with her sister Catherine and the\r\nboys and girls of the neighbourhood, or quite alone. And as often as\r\nshe could she lit a candle in honour of the heavenly lady.[183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 404.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 423.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: _Trial_, index, at the word _Bermont_.

Lanery d'Arc, _Livre d'or_, p. 330.]\r\n\r\nA mile and a quarter west of Domremy was a hill covered with a dense\r\nwood, which few dared enter for fear of boars and wolves. Wolves were\r\nthe terror of the countryside. The village mayors gave rewards for\r\nevery head of a wolf or wolf-cub brought them.[184] This wood, which\r\nJeanne could see from her threshold, was the Bois Chesnu, the wood of\r\noaks, or possibly the hoary [_chenu_] wood, the old forest.[185] We\r\nshall see later how this Bois Chesnu was the subject of a prophecy of\r\nMerlin the Magician.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Alexis Monteil, _Histoire des Francois_, vol. i, p.\r\n91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _Trial_, index, under the words _Bois Chesnu_.]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill, towards the village, was a spring[186] on the\r\nmargin of which gooseberry bushes intertwined their branches of greyish\r\ngreen. It was called the Gooseberry Spring or the Blackthorn Spring.[187]\r\nIf, as was thought by a graduate of the University of Paris,[188] Jeanne\r\ndescribed it as _La Fontaine-aux-Bonnes-Fees-Notre-Seigneur_, it must\r\nhave been because the village people called it by that name. By making\r\nuse of such a term it would seem as if those rustic souls were trying\r\nto Christianise the nymphs of the woods and waters, in whom certain\r\nteachers discerned the demons which the heathen once worshipped as\r\ngoddesses.[189] It was quite true. Goddesses as much feared and\r\nvenerated as the Parcae had come to be called Fates,[190] and to them\r\nhad been attributed power over the destinies of men. But, fallen long\r\nsince from their powerful and high estate, these village fairies had\r\ngrown as simple as the people among whom they lived. They were invited\r\nto baptisms, and a place at table was laid for them in the room next\r\nthe mother's. At these festivals they ate alone and came and went\r\nwithout any one's knowing; people avoided spying upon their movements\r\nfor fear of displeasing them. It is the custom of divine personages to\r\ngo and come in secret. They gave gifts to new-born infants. Some were\r\nvery kind, but most of them, without being malicious, appeared\r\nirritable, capricious, jealous; and if they were offended even\r\nunintentionally, they cast evil spells. Sometimes they betrayed their\r\nfeminine nature by unaccountable likes and dislikes. More than one\r\nfound a lover in a knight or a churl; but generally such loves came to\r\na bad end. And, when all is said, gentle or terrible, they remained\r\nthe Fates, they were always the Destinies.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: _Ibid._, index, under the words _Fontaine des\r\nGroseilliers_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 67-210; vol. ii. pp. 391 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, ed.

Like the spring the tree had many\r\nnames. It was called _l'Arbre-des-Dames_, _l'Arbre-aux-Loges-les-Dames_,\r\n_l'Arbre-des-Fees_, _l'Arbre-Charmine-Fee-de-Bourlemont_, _le\r\nBeau-Mai_.[195]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: Richer, _Histoire manuscrite de Jeanne d'Arc_, ms. fr.\r\n10,448, fols. 14, 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: For tree worship, see an article by M.

In the old days, when Berthe\r\nwas spinning, a lord of Bourlemont, called Pierre Granier,[196] became\r\na fairy's knight, and kept his tryst with her at eve under the\r\nbeech-tree. A romance told of their loves. One of Jeanne's godmothers,\r\nwho was a scholar at Neufchateau, had heard this story, which closely\r\nresembled that tale of Melusina so well known in Lorraine.[197] But a\r\ndoubt remained as to whether fairies still frequented the beech-tree.\r\nSome believed they did, others thought they did not. Beatrix, another\r\nof Jeanne's godmothers, used to say: \"I have heard tell that fairies\r\ncame to the tree in the old days. But for their sins they come there\r\nno longer.\"[198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 404.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: _Ibid._, p. 404, _passim_. _Simple Crayon de la\r\nnoblesse des ducs de Lorraine et de Bar_, in Le Brun des Charmettes'\r\n_Histoire de Jeanne d'Arc_, vol. i, p. 266.

There is no doubt as to the meaning of these words.]\r\n\r\nThis simple-minded woman meant that the fairies were the enemies of\r\nGod and that the priest had driven them away. Jean Morel, Jeanne's\r\ngodfather, believed the same.[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF JOAN OF ARC AT DOMREMY IN 1419]\r\n\r\nIndeed on Ascension Eve, on Rogation days and Ember days, crosses were\r\ncarried through the fields and the priest went to _l'Arbre-des-Fees_\r\nand chanted the Gospel of St. John. He chanted it also at the\r\nGooseberry Spring and at the other springs in the parish.[200] For the\r\nexorcising of evil spirits there was nothing like the Gospel of St.\r\nJohn.[201]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 397.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: _Ibid._, p. 390. Bergier, _Dictionnaire de theologie_,\r\nunder the word _Conjuration_.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord Aubert d'Ourches held that there had been no fairies at\r\nDomremy for twenty or thirty years.[202] On the other hand there were\r\nthose in the village who believed that Christians still held converse\r\nwith them and that Thursday was the trysting day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 187.]\r\n\r\nYet another of Jeanne's godmothers, the wife of the mayor Aubrit, had\r\nwith her own eyes seen fairies under the tree. She had told her\r\ngoddaughter. And Aubrit's wife was known to be no witch or soothsayer\r\nbut a good woman and a circumspect.[203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: _Ibid._, pp. 67, 209.]\r\n\r\nIn all this Jeanne suspected witchcraft. For her own part she had\r\nnever met the fairies under the tree. But she would not have said that\r\nshe had not seen fairies elsewhere.[204] Fairies are not like angels;\r\nthey do not always appear what they really are.[205]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: _Ibid._, pp. 178, 209 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: For the traditions of fairies at Domremy and for\r\nJeanne's opinion of them, see _Trial_, index, under the word _Fees_.]\r\n\r\nEvery year, on the fourth Sunday in Lent,--called by the Church\r\n\"_Laetare_ Sunday,\" because during the mass of the day was chanted the\r\npassage beginning _Laetare Jerusalem_,--the peasants of Bar held a\r\nrustic festival. This was their well-dressing when they went together\r\nto drink from some spring and to dance on the grass. The peasants of\r\nGreux kept their festival at the Chapel of Notre-Dame de Bermont;\r\nthose of Domremy at the Gooseberry Spring and at _l'Arbre-des-Fees_.[206]\r\nThey used to recall the days when the lord and lady of Bourlemont\r\nthemselves led the young people of the village. But Jeanne was still a\r\nbabe in arms when Pierre de Bourlemont, lord of Domremy and Greux,\r\ndied childless, leaving his lands to his niece Jeanne de Joinville,\r\nwho lived at Nancy, having married the chamberlain of the Duke of\r\nLorraine.[207]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: Concerning the Sunday and the Festival of the\r\nWell-Dressing at Domremy, see _Trial_, index, under the word\r\n_Fontaine_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 67, 212, 404 _et seq._ S. Luce,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. xx-xxii.]\r\n\r\nAt the well-dressing the young men and maidens of Domremy went to the\r\nold beech-tree together. After they had hung it with garlands of\r\nflowers, they spread a cloth on the grass and supped off nuts,\r\nhard-boiled eggs, and little rolls of a curious form, which the\r\nhousewives had kneaded on purpose.[208] Then they drank from the\r\nGooseberry Spring, danced in a ring, and returned to their own homes\r\nat nightfall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 407, 411, 413, 421.]\r\n\r\nJeanne, like all the other damsels of the countryside, took her part\r\nin the well-dressing. Although she came from the quarter of Domremy\r\nnearest Greux, she kept her feast, not at Notre-Dame de Bermont, but\r\nat the Gooseberry Spring and _l'Arbre-des-Fees_.[209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: _Ibid._, pp. 391-462.]\r\n\r\nIn her early childhood she danced round the tree with her companions.\r\nShe wove garlands for the image of Notre-Dame de Domremy, whose\r\nchapel crowned a neighbouring hill. The maidens were wont to hang\r\ngarlands on the branches of _l'Arbre-des-Fees_. Jeanne, like the\r\nothers, bewreathed the tree's branches; and, like the others,\r\nsometimes she left her wreaths behind and sometimes she carried them\r\naway. No one knew what became of them; and it seems their\r\ndisappearance was such as to cause wise and learned persons to wonder.\r\nOne thing, however, is sure: that the sick who drank from the spring\r\nwere healed and straightway walked beneath the tree.[210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 67, 209, 210.]\r\n\r\nTo hail the coming of spring they made a figure of May, a mannikin of\r\nflowers and foliage.[211]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 434.]\r\n\r\nClose by _l'Arbre-des-Dames_, beneath a hazel-tree, there was a\r\nmandrake. He promised wealth to whomsoever should dare by night, and\r\naccording to the prescribed rites, to tear him from the ground,[212]\r\nnot fearing to hear him cry or to see blood flow from his little human\r\nbody and his forked feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: _Atropa Mandragor_, female mandragora, _main de\r\ngloire_, _herbe aux magiciens_. _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 89, 213. _Journal\r\nd'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nThe tree, the spring, and the mandrake caused the inhabitants of\r\nDomremy to be suspected of holding converse with evil spirits. A\r\nlearned doctor said plainly that the country was famous for the number\r\nof persons who practised witchcraft.[213]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nWhen quite a little girl, Jeanne journeyed several times to Sermaize\r\nin Champagne, where dwelt certain of her kinsfolk. The village priest,\r\nMessire Henri de Vouthon, was her uncle on her mother's side. She had\r\na cousin there, Perrinet de Vouthon, by calling a tiler, and his son\r\nHenri.[214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: This is probable but not certain. _Trial_, vol. ii, pp.\r\n74, 388; vol. v, p. 252.

Gilardoni, _Sermaize et son eglise_, published at\r\nVitry-le-Francois, 1893, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nFull thirty-seven and a half miles of forest and heath lie between\r\nDomremy and Sermaize. Jeanne, we may believe, travelled on horseback,\r\nriding behind her brother on the little mare which worked on the\r\nfarm.[215]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Capitaine Champion, _Jeanne d'Arc ecuyere_, Paris,\r\n1901, 12mo, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nAt each visit the child spent several days at her cousin Perrinet's\r\nhouse.[216]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Boucher de Molandon, _La famille de Jeanne d'Arc_, p.\r\n627. E. de Bouteiller et G. de Braux, _Nouvelles recherches_, pp. 9\r\nand 10. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. xlv _et seq._]\r\n\r\nWith regard to feudal overlordship the village of Domremy was divided\r\ninto two distinct parts. The southern part, with the chateau on the\r\nMeuse and some thirty homesteads, belonged to the lords of Bourlemont\r\nand was in the domain of the castellany of Grondrecourt, held in fief\r\nfrom the crown of France. It was a part of Lorraine and of Bar. The\r\nnorthern half of the village, in which the monastery was situated, was\r\nsubject to the provost of Monteclaire and Andelot and was in the\r\nbailiwick of Chaumont in Champagne.[217] It was sometimes called\r\nDomremy de Greux because it seemed to form a part of the village of\r\nGreux adjoining it on the highroad in the direction of Vaucouleurs.[218]\r\nThe serfs of Bourlemont were separated from the king's men by a brook,\r\nclose by towards the west, flowing from a threefold source and hence\r\ncalled, so it is said, the Brook of the Three Springs. Modestly the\r\nstream flowed beneath a flat stone in front of the church, and then\r\nrushed down a rapid incline into the Meuse, opposite Jacques d'Arc's\r\nhouse, which it passed on the left, leaving it in the land of\r\nChampagne and of France.[219] So far we may be fairly certain; but we\r\nmust beware of knowing more than was known in that day. In 1429 King\r\nCharles' council was uncertain as to whether Jacques d'Arc was a\r\nfreeman or a serf.[220] And Jacques d'Arc himself doubtless was no\r\nbetter informed. On both banks of the brook, the men of Lorraine and\r\nChampagne were alike peasants leading a life of toil and hardship.\r\nAlthough they were subject to different masters they formed none the\r\nless one community closely united, one single rural family. They\r\nshared interests, necessities, feelings--everything. Threatened by the\r\nsame dangers, they had the same anxieties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: E. Misset, _Jeanne d'Arc champenoise_, Paris, s.d.\r\n(1894), 8vo.

But theirs were the quarrels of princes. The\r\nvillagers observed them just as the frog in the old fable looked on at\r\nthe bulls fighting in the meadow. Pale and trembling, poor Jacques saw\r\nhimself trodden underfoot by these fierce warriors. At a time when the\r\nwhole of Christendom was given up to pillage, the men-at-arms of the\r\nLorraine Marches were renowned as the greatest plunderers in the\r\nworld. Unfortunately for the labourers of the castellany of\r\nVaucouleurs, close to this domain, towards the north, there lived\r\nRobert de Saarbruck, Damoiseau of Commercy, who, subsisting on\r\nplunder, was especially given to the Lorraine custom of marauding. He\r\nwas of the same way of thinking as that English king who said that\r\nwarfare without burnings was no good, any more than chitterlings\r\nwithout mustard.[222] One day, when he was besieging a little\r\nstronghold in which the peasants had taken refuge, the Damoiseau set\r\nfire to the crops of the neighbourhood and let them burn all night\r\nlong, so that he might see more clearly how to place his men.[223]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: Colonel de Boureulle, _Le pays de Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nSaint-Die, 1890, in 8vo, 28 small engravings.

Tuetey, _Les ecorcheurs sous Charles VII_,\r\nMontbeliard, 1874, vol. i, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nIn 1419 this baron was making war on the brothers Didier and Durand of\r\nSaint-Die. It matters not for what reason. For this war as for every\r\nwar the villagers had to pay. As the men-at-arms were fighting\r\nthroughout the whole castellany of Vaucouleurs, the inhabitants of\r\nDomremy began to devise means of safety, and in this wise. At Domremy\r\nthere was a castle built in the meadow at the angle of an island\r\nformed by two arms of the river, one of which, the eastern arm, has\r\nlong since been filled up.[224] Belonging to this castle was a chapel\r\nof Our Lady, a courtyard provided with means of defence, and a large\r\ngarden surrounded by a moat wide and deep. This castle, once the\r\ndwelling of the Lords of Bourlemont, was commonly called the Fortress\r\nof the Island. The last of the lords having died without children, his\r\nproperty had been inherited by his niece Jeanne de Joinville. But soon\r\nafter Jeanne d'Arc's birth she married a Lorraine baron, Henri\r\nd'Ogiviller, with whom she went to reside at the castle of Ogiviller\r\nand at the ducal court of Nancy. Since her departure the fortress of\r\nthe island had remained uninhabited. The village folk decided to rent\r\nit and to put their tools and their cattle therein out of reach of the\r\nplunderers. The renting was put up to auction. A certain Jean Biget of\r\nDomremy and Jacques d'Arc, Jeanne's father, being the highest bidders,\r\nand having furnished sufficient security, a lease was drawn up between\r\nthem and the representatives of Dame d'Ogiviller. The fortress, the\r\ngarden, the courtyard, as well as the meadows belonging to the domain,\r\nwere let to Jean Biget and Jacques d'Arc for a term of nine years\r\nbeginning on St. John the Baptist's Day, 1419, and in consideration of\r\na yearly rent of fourteen _livres tournois_[225] and three _imaux_ of\r\nwheat.[226] Besides the two tenants in chief there were five\r\nsub-tenants, of whom the first mentioned was Jacquemin, the eldest of\r\nJacques d'Arc's sons.[227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 66, 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: In 1390 one _livre tournois_ was worth L7 5_s_ of\r\npresent money; in 1488, L5. Cf. Avenel, _Histoire economique_, 1894\r\n(W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: \"_Imal_,\" says Le Trevoux, \"is a measure of corn used\r\nat Nancy.\" There are two _imaux_ in a quarter, and four quarters in a\r\n_real_, which contains fifteen bushels, according to the Paris\r\nmeasure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: The Archives of the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle,\r\ncollection Ruppes II, No. 28.

In that very year, 1419, Robert de\r\nSaarbruck and his company met the men of the brothers Didier and\r\nDurand at the village of Maxey, the thatched roofs of which were to be\r\nseen opposite Greux, on the other bank of the Meuse, along the foot of\r\nwooded hills. The two sides here engaged in a battle, in which the\r\nvictorious Damoiseau took thirty-five prisoners, whom he afterwards\r\nliberated after having exacted a high ransom, as was his wont. Among\r\nthese prisoners was the Squire Thiesselin de Vittel, whose wife had\r\nheld Jacques d'Arc's second daughter over the baptismal font. From one\r\nof the hills of her village, Jeanne, who was then seven or a little\r\nolder, could see the battle in which her godmother's husband was taken\r\nprisoner.[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 420-426. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a\r\nDomremy_, p. lxiv.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile matters grew worse and worse in the kingdom of France. This\r\nwas well known at Domremy, situated as it was on the highroad, and\r\nhearing the news brought by wayfarers.[229] Thus it was that the\r\nvillagers heard of the murder of Duke John of Burgundy on the Bridge\r\nat Montereau, when the Dauphin's Councillors made him pay the price of\r\nthe blood he had shed in the Rue Barbette. These Councillors, however,\r\nstruck a bad bargain; for the murder on the Bridge brought their young\r\nPrince very low. There followed the war between the Armagnacs and the\r\nBurgundians. From this war the English, the obstinate enemies of the\r\nkingdom, who for two hundred years had held Guyenne and carried on a\r\nprosperous trade there,[230] sucked no small advantage. But Guyenne\r\nwas far away, and perhaps no one at Domremy knew that it had once been\r\na part of the domain of the kings of France. On the other hand every\r\none was aware that during the recent trouble the English had recrossed\r\nthe sea and had been welcomed by my Lord Philip, son of the late Duke\r\nJohn. They occupied Normandy, Maine, Picardy, l'Ile-de-France, and\r\nParis the great city.[231] Now in France the English were bitterly\r\nhated and greatly feared on account of their reputation for cruelty.\r\nNot that they were really more wicked than other nations.[232] In\r\nNormandy, their king, Henry, had caused women and property to be\r\nrespected in all places under his dominion. But war is in itself\r\ncruel, and whosoever wages war in a country is rightly hated by the\r\npeople of that country. The English were accused of treachery, and\r\nnot always wrongly accused, for good faith is rare among men. They\r\nwere ridiculed in various ways. Playing upon their name in Latin and\r\nin French, they were called angels. Now if they were angels they were\r\nassuredly bad angels. They denied God, and their favorite oath\r\n_Goddam_[233] was so often on their lips that they were called\r\n_Godons_. They were devils. They were said to be _coues_, that is, to\r\nhave tails behind.[234] There was mourning in many a French household\r\nwhen Queen Ysabeau delivered the kingdom of France to the\r\n_coues_,[235] making of the noble French lilies a litter for the\r\nleopard. Since then, only a few days apart, King Henry V of Lancaster\r\nand King Charles VI of Valois, the victorious king and the mad king,\r\nhad departed to present themselves before God, the Judge of the good\r\nand the evil, the just and the unjust, the weak and the powerful. The\r\ncastellany of Vaucouleurs was French.[236] Dwelling there were clerks\r\nand nobles who pitied that later Joash, torn from his enemies in\r\nchildhood, an orphan spoiled of his heritage, in whom centred the hope\r\nof the kingdom. But how can we imagine that poor husbandmen had\r\nleisure to ponder on these things? How can we really believe that the\r\npeasants of Domremy were loyal to the Dauphin Charles, their lawful\r\nlord, while the Lorrainers of Maxey, following their Duke, were on the\r\nside of the Burgundians?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Lienard, _Dictionnaire topographique de la Meuse_,\r\nintroduction, p. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: Dom Devienne, _Histoire de Bordeaux_, pp. 98, 103.

The\r\nDomremy and Greux children went there to school. There were quarrels\r\nbetween them; the little Burgundians of Maxey fought pitched battles\r\nwith the little Armagnacs of Domremy. More than once Joan, at the\r\nBridge end in the evening, saw the lads of her village returning\r\ncovered with blood.[237] It is quite possible that, passionate as she\r\nwas, she may have gravely espoused these quarrels and conceived\r\ntherefrom a bitter hatred of the Burgundians. Nevertheless, we must\r\nbeware of finding an indication of public opinion in these boyish\r\ngames played by the sons of villeins. For centuries the brats of these\r\ntwo parishes were to fight and to insult each other.[238] Insults and\r\nstones fly whenever and wherever children gather in bands, and those\r\nof one village meet those of another. The peasants of Domremy, Greux,\r\nand Maxey, we may be sure, vexed themselves little about the affairs\r\nof dukes and kings. They had learnt to be as much afraid of the\r\ncaptains of their own side as of the captains of the opposite party,\r\nand not to draw any distinction between the men-at-arms who were their\r\nfriends and those who were their enemies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 65, 66.

Messire Robert, Lord of Baudricourt\r\nand Blaise, son of the late Messire Liebault de Baudricourt, was then\r\ncaptain of Vaucouleurs and bailie of Chaumont for the Dauphin Charles.\r\nHe might be reckoned a great plunderer, even in Lorraine. In the\r\nspring of this year, 1420, the Duke of Burgundy having sent an embassy\r\nto the Lord Bishop of Verdun, as the ambassadors were returning they\r\nwere taken prisoners by Sire Robert in league with the Damoiseau of\r\nCommercy. To avenge this offence the Duke of Burgundy declared war on\r\nthe Captain of Vaucouleurs, and the castellany was ravaged by bands of\r\nEnglish and Burgundians.[239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, ch. iii.]\r\n\r\nIn 1423 the Duke of Lorraine was waging war with a terrible man, one\r\nEtienne de Vignolles, a Gascon soldier of fortune already famous under\r\nthe dreaded name of La Hire,[240] which he was to leave after his\r\ndeath to the knave of hearts in those packs of cards marked by the\r\ngreasy fingers of many a mercenary. La Hire was nominally on the side\r\nof the Dauphin Charles, but in reality he only made war on his own\r\naccount. At this time he was ravaging Bar west and south, burning\r\nchurches and laying waste villages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Pierre d'Alheim, _Le jargon Jobelin_, Paris, 1892, in\r\n18mo: glossary, under the word _Hirenalle_, p. 61, and the verbal\r\ncommunication of M.

Collot Turlaut,\r\nwho two years before had married Mengette, daughter of Jean de\r\nVouthon and Jeanne's cousin-german,[241] was killed there by a bomb\r\nfired from a Lorraine mortar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: S.

Many\r\nduties fell to the lot of the village elder, especially in troubled\r\ntimes. It was for him to summon the mayor and the aldermen to the\r\ncouncil meetings, to cry the decrees, to command the watch day and\r\nnight, to guard the prisoners. It was for him also to collect taxes,\r\nrents, and feudal dues, an ungrateful office in a ruined country.[242]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: Bonvalot, _Le tiers etat d'apres la charte de Beaumont\r\net ses filiales_, Paris, 1886, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nUnder pretence of safeguarding and protecting them, Robert de\r\nSaarbruck, Damoiseau of Commercy, who for the moment was Armagnac, was\r\nplundering and ransoming the villages belonging to Bar, on the left\r\nbank of the Meuse.[243] On the 7th of October, 1423, Jacques d'Arc, as\r\nelder, signed below the mayor and sheriff the act by which the Squire\r\nextorted from these poor people the annual payment of two _gros_ from\r\neach complete household and one from each widow's household, a tax\r\nwhich amounted to no less than two hundred and twenty golden crowns,\r\nwhich the elder was charged to collect before the winter feast of\r\nSaint-Martin.[244]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. lxxi _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Ibid._, proofs and illustrations, li, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nThe following year was bad for the Dauphin Charles, for the French and\r\nScottish horsemen of his party met with the worst possible treatment\r\nat Verneuil. This year the Damoiseau of Commercy turned Burgundian and\r\nwas none the better or the worse for it.[245] Captain La Hire was\r\nstill fighting in Bar, but now it was against the young son of Madame\r\nYolande, the Dauphin Charles's brother-in-law, Rene d'Anjou, who had\r\nlately come of age and was now invested with the Duchy of Bar. At the\r\npoint of the lance Captain La Hire was demanding certain sums of money\r\nthat the Cardinal Duke of Bar owed him.[246]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, pp.\r\n16, 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, appendix, lxii.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Robert, Sire de Baudricourt, was fighting with Jean\r\nde Vergy, lord of Saint-Dizier, Seneschal of Burgundy.[247] It was a\r\nfine war. On both sides the combatants laid hands on bread, wine,\r\nmoney, silver-plate, clothes, cattle big and little, and what could\r\nnot be carried off was burnt. Men, women, and children were put to\r\nransom. In most of the villages of Bassigny agriculture was suspended,\r\nnearly all the mills were destroyed.[248]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: Du Chesne, _Genealogie de la maison de Vergy_, Paris,\r\n1625, folio. _Nouvelle biographie generale_, vol. xlv, p. 1125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: S. Luce, Domremy and Vaucouleurs, from 1412 to 1425, in\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, ch. iii.]\r\n\r\nTen, twenty, thirty bands of Burgundians were ravaging the castellany\r\nof Vaucouleurs, laying it waste with fire and sword. The peasants hid\r\ntheir horses by day, and by night got up to take them to graze. At\r\nDomremy life was one perpetual alarm.[249] All day and all night there\r\nwas a watchman stationed on the square tower of the monastery. Every\r\nvillager, and, if the prevailing custom were observed, even the\r\npriest, took his turn as watchman, peering for the glint of lances\r\nthrough the dust and sunlight down the white ribbon of the road,\r\nsearching the horrid depths of the wood, and by night trembling to see\r\nthe villages on the horizon bursting into flame. At the approach of\r\nmen-at-arms the watchman would ring a noisy peal of those bells, which\r\nin turn celebrated births, mourned for the dead, summoned the people\r\nto prayer, dispelled storms of thunder and lightning, and warned of\r\ndanger. Half clothed the awakened villagers would rush to stable, to\r\ncattle-shed, and pell-mell drive their flocks and herds to the castle\r\nbetween the two arms of the River Meuse.[250]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 66. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a\r\nDomremy_, p. lxxxvi, and appendix, xiv, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nOne day in the summer of 1425, there fell upon the villages of Greux\r\nand Domremy a certain chief of these marauding bands, who was\r\nmurdering and plundering throughout the land, by name Henri d'Orly,\r\nknown as Henri de Savoie. This time the island fortress was of no use\r\nto the villagers. Lord Henri took all the cattle from the two villages\r\nand drove them fifteen or twenty leagues[251] away to his _chateau_ of\r\nDoulevant. He had also captured much furniture and other property; and\r\nthe quantity of it was so great that he could not store it all in one\r\nplace; wherefore he had part of it carried to Dommartin-le-Franc, a\r\nneighbouring village, where there was a _chateau_ with so large a\r\ncourt in front that the place was called Dommartin-la-Cour. The\r\npeasants cruelly despoiled were dying of hunger. Happily for them, at\r\nthe news of this pillage, Dame d'Ogiviller sent to the Count of\r\nVaudemont in his _chateau_ of Joinville, complaining to him, as her\r\nkinsman, of the wrong done her, since she was lady of Greux and\r\nDomremy. The _chateau_ of Doulevant was under the immediate suzerainty\r\nof the Count of Vaudemont. As soon as he received his kinswoman's\r\nmessage he sent a man-at-arms with seven or eight soldiers to\r\nrecapture the cattle. This man-at-arms, by name Barthelemy de\r\nClefmont, barely twenty years of age, was well skilled in deeds of\r\nwar. He found the stolen beasts in the _chateau_ of Dommartin-le-Franc,\r\ntook them and drove them to Joinville. On the way he was pursued and\r\nattacked by Lord d'Orly's men and stood in great danger of death. But\r\nso valiantly did he defend himself that he arrived safe and sound at\r\nJoinville, bringing the cattle, which the Count of Vaudemont caused to\r\nbe driven back to the pastures of Greux and Domremy.[252]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: A league is two and a half English miles (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. 275 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nUnexpected good fortune! With tears the husbandman welcomed his\r\nrestored flocks and herds. But was he not likely to lose them for ever\r\non the morrow?\r\n\r\nAt that time Jeanne was thirteen or fourteen. War everywhere around\r\nher, even in the children's play; the husband of one of her godmothers\r\ntaken and ransomed by men-at-arms; the husband of her cousin-german\r\nMengette killed by a mortar;[253] her native land overrun by\r\nmarauders, burnt, pillaged, laid waste, all the cattle carried off;\r\nnights of terror, dreams of horror,--such were the surroundings of her\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: E. de Bouteiller and G. de Braux, _Nouvelles\r\nrecherches_, pp. 4-15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJEANNE'S VOICES\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when she was about thirteen, it befell one summer day, at noon,\r\nthat while she was in her father's garden she heard a voice that\r\nfilled her with a great fear. It came from the right, from towards the\r\nchurch, and at the same time in the same direction there appeared a\r\nlight. The voice said: \"I come from God to help thee to live a good\r\nand holy life.[254] Be good, Jeannette, and God will aid thee.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 52, 72, 73, 89, 170.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that fasting conduces to the seeing of visions.\r\nJeanne was accustomed to fast. Had she abstained from food that\r\nmorning and if so when had she last partaken of it? We cannot\r\nsay.[255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: The manuscript runs: _non jejunaverat die praecedenti_.\r\nQuicherat omits _non_. _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52. Cf. _Revue critique_,\r\nMarch, 1908, p. 215.]\r\n\r\nOn another day the voice spoke again and repeated, \"Jeannette, be\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThe child did not know whence the voice came. But the third time, as\r\nshe listened, she knew it was an angel's voice and she even recognised\r\nthe angel to be St. Michael. She could not be mistaken, for she knew\r\nhim well. He was the patron saint of the duchy of Bar.[256] She\r\nsometimes saw him on the pillar of church or chapel, in the guise of\r\na handsome knight, with a crown on his helmet, wearing a coat of mail,\r\nbearing a shield, and transfixing the devil with his lance.[257]\r\nSometimes he was represented holding the scales in which he weighed\r\nsouls, for he was provost of heaven and warden of paradise;[258] at\r\nonce the leader of the heavenly hosts and the angel of judgment.[259]\r\nHe loved high lands.[260] That is why in Lorraine a chapel had been\r\ndedicated to him on Mount Sombar, north of the town of Toul. In very\r\nremote times he had appeared to the Bishop of Avranches and commanded\r\nhim to build a church on Mount Tombe, in such a place as he should\r\nfind a bull hidden by thieves; and the site of the building was to\r\ninclude the whole area overtrodden by the bull. The Abbey of\r\nMont-Saint-Michel-au-Peril-de-la-Mer was erected in obedience to this\r\ncommand.[261]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: V.

The French attributed this victory to the\r\nall-powerful intercession of the archangel.[262] And why should he not\r\nhave favoured the French who worshipped him with peculiar devoutness?\r\nSince my Lord St. Denys had permitted his abbey to be taken by the\r\nEnglish, my Lord St. Michael, who carefully guarded his, was in a fair\r\nway to become the true patron saint of the kingdom.[263] In the year\r\n1419 the Dauphin Charles had had escutcheons painted, representing St.\r\nMichael fully armed, holding a naked sword and in the act of slaying a\r\nserpent.[264] The maid of Domremy, however, knew but little of the\r\nmiracles worked by my Lord St. Michael in Normandy. She recognised the\r\nangel by his weapons, his courtesy, and the noble words that fell from\r\nhis lips.[265]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 272 (opinion of Jean Bochard, called de Vaucelle,\r\nBishop of Avranches).

Act according to their advice; for they are appointed to\r\nguide thee and counsel thee in all thou hast to do, and thou mayest\r\nbelieve what they shall say unto thee.\" And these things came to pass\r\nas the Lord had ordained.[266]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _Ibid._, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nThis promise filled her with great joy, for she loved them both.\r\nMadame Sainte Marguerite was highly honoured in the kingdom of\r\nFrance, where she was a great benefactress. She helped women in\r\nlabour,[267] and protected the peasant at work in the fields. She was\r\nthe patron saint of flax-spinners, of procurers of wet-nurses, of\r\nvellum-dressers, and of bleachers of wool. Her precious relics in a\r\nreliquary, carried on a mule's back, were paraded by ecclesiastics\r\nthrough towns and villages. Plenteous alms[268] were showered upon the\r\nexhibitors in return for permission to touch the relics. Many times\r\nhad Jeanne seen Madame Sainte Marguerite at church, painted life-size,\r\na holy-water sprinkler in her hand, her foot on a dragon's head.[269]\r\nShe was acquainted with her history as it was related in those days,\r\nsomewhat on the lines of the following narrative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: _La vierge Marguerite substituee a la Lucine antique_,\r\nanalysis of an unpublished poem of the fifteenth century, Paris, 1885,\r\nin 8vo, p. 2.

Hinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 65-72.]\r\n\r\nThe blessed Margaret was born at Antioch. Her father, Theodosius, was\r\na priest of the Gentiles. She was put out to nurse and secretly\r\nbaptised. One day when she was in her fifteenth year, as she was\r\nwatching the flock belonging to her nurse, the governor Olibrius saw\r\nher, and, struck by her great beauty, conceived a great passion for\r\nher. Wherefore he said to his servants: \"Go, bring me that girl, in\r\norder that if she be free I may marry her, or if she be a slave I may\r\ntake her into my service.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when she was brought he inquired of her her country, her name,\r\nand her religion. She replied that she was called Margaret and that\r\nshe was a Christian.\r\n\r\nAnd Olibrius said unto her: \"How comes it that so noble and beautiful\r\na girl as you can worship Jesus the Crucified?\"\r\n\r\nAnd because she replied that Jesus Christ was alive for ever, the\r\ngovernor in wrath had her thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nThe next day he summoned her to appear before him and said: \"Unhappy\r\ngirl, have pity on your own beauty and for your own sake worship our\r\ngods. If you persist in your blindness I will have your body rent in\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Margaret made answer: \"Jesus suffered death for me, and I would\r\nfain die for him.\"\r\n\r\nThen the governor commanded her to be hung from the wooden horse, to\r\nbe beaten with rods, and her flesh to be torn with iron claws. And the\r\nblood flowed from the virgin's body as from a pure spring of fresh\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThose who stood by wept, and the governor covered his face with his\r\ncloak that he might not see the blood. And he commanded to unloose her\r\nand take her back to prison.\r\n\r\nThere she was tempted by the Spirit, and she prayed the Lord to reveal\r\nto her the enemy whom she had to withstand. Thereupon a huge dragon,\r\nappearing before her, rushed forward to devour her, but she made the\r\nsign of the cross and he disappeared. Then, in order to seduce her,\r\nthe devil assumed the form of a man. He came to her gently, took her\r\nhands in his and said: \"Margaret, what you have done sufficeth.\" But\r\nshe seized him by the hair, threw him to the ground, placed her right\r\nfoot upon his head and cried: \"Tremble, proud enemy, thou liest\r\nbeneath a woman's foot.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the presence of the assembled people, she was brought\r\nbefore the judge, who commanded her to sacrifice to idols. And when\r\nshe refused he had her body burned with flaming pine-wood, but she\r\nseemed to suffer no pain. And fearing lest, amazed at this miracle,\r\nall the people should be converted, Olibrius commanded that the\r\nblessed Margaret should be beheaded. She spoke unto the executioner\r\nand said: \"Brother, take your axe and strike me.\" With one blow he\r\nstruck off her head. Her soul took flight to heaven in the form of a\r\ndove.[270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Voragine, _La legende doree_ (Legende de Sainte\r\nMarguerite). Douhet, _Dictionnaire des legendes_, pp. 824-836.]\r\n\r\nThis story had been told in songs and mysteries.[271] It was so well\r\nknown that the name of the governor, jestingly vilified and fallen\r\ninto ridicule, was in common parlance bestowed on braggarts and\r\nblusterers. A fool who posed as a wicked person was called _an\r\nolibrius_.[272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: Gaston Paris, _La litterature francaise au moyen age_,\r\n1890, in 16mo, p. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: La Curne, _Dictionnaire de l'ancien langage francais_,\r\nunder the word _Olibrius_.

The legend\r\nof Saint Reine is only a somewhat ancient variant of the legend of\r\nSaint Margaret.]\r\n\r\nMadame Sainte Catherine, whose coming the angel had announced to\r\nJeanne at the same time as that of Madame Sainte Marguerite, was the\r\nprotectress of young girls and especially of servants and spinsters.\r\n\r\nOrators and philosophers too had chosen as their patron saint the\r\nvirgin who had confounded the fifty doctors and triumphed over the\r\nmagi of the east. In the Meuse valley rhymed prayers like the\r\nfollowing were addressed to her:\r\n\r\n    Ave, tres sainte Catherine,\r\n    Vierge pucelle nette et fine.[273]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273:\r\n\r\n    Hail, thou holy Catherine,\r\n    Virgin Maid so pure and fine.\r\n\r\n_Bibliotheque Mazarine, manuscrit_, 515. _Recueil de prieres_, folio\r\n55. This manuscript comes from the banks of the Meuse.]\r\n\r\nThis fine lady was no stranger to Jeanne; she had her church at Maxey,\r\non the opposite bank of the river; and her name was borne by Isabelle\r\nRomee's eldest daughter.[274]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: S. Luce, _loc. cit._, proofs and illustrations, xiii,\r\np. 19, note 2.

Jean Mielot told how the virgin of Alexandria\r\ncontroverted the subtle arguments of Homer, the syllogisms of\r\nAristotle, the very learned reasonings of the famous physicians\r\nAEsculapius and Galen, practised the seven liberal arts, and disputed\r\naccording to the rules of dialectics.[275] Jacques d'Arc's daughter\r\nhad heard nothing of all that; she knew Saint Catherine from stories\r\nout of some history written in the vulgar tongue, in verse or in\r\nprose, so many of which were in circulation at that time.[276]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: J. Mielot, _Vie de sainte Catherine_, text revised by\r\nMarius Sepet, 1881, in large 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Gaston Paris, _La litterature francaise au moyen age_,\r\npp. 82, 213.]\r\n\r\nCatherine, daughter of King Costus and Queen Sabinella, as she grew in\r\nyears, became proficient in the arts, and a skilful embroiderer in\r\nsilk. While her body was resplendent with beauty, her soul was clouded\r\nby the darkness of idolatry. Many barons of the empire sought her in\r\nmarriage; she scorned them and said: \"Find me a husband wise,\r\nhandsome, noble, and rich.\" Now in her sleep she had a vision. Holding\r\nthe Child Jesus in her arms, the Virgin Mary appeared unto her and\r\nsaid: \"Catherine, will you take him for your husband? And you, my\r\nsweet son, will you have this virgin for your bride?\"\r\n\r\nThe Child Jesus made answer: \"Mother, I will not have her; bid her\r\ndepart from you, for she is a worshipper of idols. But if she will be\r\nbaptised I will consent to put the nuptial ring on her finger.\"\r\n\r\nDesiring to marry the King of Heaven, Catherine went to ask for\r\nbaptism at the hands of the hermit Ananias, who lived in Armenia on\r\nMount Negra. A few days afterwards, when she was praying in her room,\r\nshe saw Jesus Christ appear in the midst of a numerous choir of angels\r\nand of saints. He drew near unto her and placed his ring upon her\r\nfinger. Then only did Catherine know that her bridal was a spiritual\r\nbridal.\r\n\r\nIn those days Maxentius was Emperor of the Romans. He commanded the\r\npeople of Alexandria to offer great sacrifices to the idols.\r\nCatherine, as she was at prayer in her oratory, heard the chanting of\r\nthe priests and the bellowing of the victims. Straightway she went to\r\nthe public square, and beholding Maxentius at the gate of the temple,\r\nshe said unto him: \"How comes it that thou art so foolish as to\r\ncommand this people to offer incense to idols? Thou admirest this\r\ntemple built by the hands of thy workmen. Thou admirest these\r\nornaments which are but dust blown away by the wind. Thou shouldest\r\nrather admire the sky, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is\r\ntherein. Thou shouldest rather admire the ornaments of the heavens:\r\nthe sun, the moon, and the stars, and those circling planets, which\r\nfrom the beginning of the world move from the west and return to the\r\neast and never grow weary. And when thou hast observed all these\r\nthings, ask and learn who is their Creator. It is our God, the Lord of\r\nHosts, and the God of gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman,\" replied the emperor, \"leave us to finish our sacrifice;\r\nafterwards we will make answer unto thee.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he commanded Catherine to be taken into the palace and strictly\r\nguarded, because he marvelled at the great wisdom and the wonderful\r\nbeauty of this virgin. He summoned fifty doctors well versed in the\r\nknowledge of the Egyptians and the liberal arts; and, when they were\r\ngathered together, he said unto them: \"A maiden of subtle mind\r\nmaintains that our gods are but demons. I could have forced her to\r\nsacrifice or have made her pay the penalty of her disobedience; I\r\njudged it better that she should be confounded by the power of your\r\nreasoning. If you triumph over her, you will return to your homes\r\nladen with honours.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the wise men made answer: \"Let her be brought, that her rashness\r\nmay be made manifest, that she may confess that never until now has\r\nshe met men of wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when she learned that she was to dispute with wise men, Catherine\r\nfeared lest she should not worthily defend the gospel of Jesus Christ.\r\nBut an angel appeared to her and said: \"I am the Archangel Saint\r\nMichael, sent by God to make known unto thee that from this strife\r\nthou shalt come forth victorious and worthy of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nthe hope and crown of those who strive for him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the virgin disputed with the doctors. When they maintained that it\r\nwas impossible for God to become man, and be acquainted with grief,\r\nCatherine showed how the birth and passion of Jesus Christ had been\r\nannounced by the Gentiles themselves, and prophesied by Plato and the\r\nSibyl.\r\n\r\nThe doctors had nothing to oppose to arguments so convincing.\r\nTherefore the chief among them said to the emperor: \"Thou knowest that\r\nup till now no one has disputed with us without being straightway\r\nconfounded. But this maid, through whom the Spirit of God speaks,\r\nfills us with wonder, and we know nothing nor dare we say anything\r\nagainst Christ. And we boldly confess that if thou hast no stronger\r\narguments to bring forth in favour of the gods, whom hitherto we have\r\nworshipped, we will all of us embrace the Christian religion.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, the tyrant was so transported with wrath that\r\nhe had the fifty doctors burned in the middle of the town. But as a\r\nsign that they suffered for the truth, neither their garments nor the\r\nhairs of their heads were touched by the fire.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Maxentius said unto Catherine: \"O virgin, issue of a noble\r\nline, and worthy of the imperial purple, take counsel with thy youth,\r\nand sacrifice to our gods. If thou dost consent, thou shalt take rank\r\nin my palace after the empress, and thy image, placed in the middle of\r\nthe town, shall be worshipped by all the people like that of a\r\ngoddess.\"\r\n\r\nBut Catherine answered: \"Speak not of such things. The very thought of\r\nthem is sin. Jesus Christ hath chosen me for his bride. He is my love,\r\nmy glory, and all my delight.\"\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to flatter her with soft words, the tyrant hoped\r\nto reduce her to obedience through fear; therefore he threatened her\r\nwith death.\r\n\r\nCatherine's courage did not waver. \"Jesus Christ,\" she said, \"offered\r\nhimself to his Father as a sacrifice for me; it is my great joy to\r\noffer myself as an agreeable sacrifice to the glory of his name.\"\r\n\r\nStraightway Maxentius commanded that she should be scourged with rods,\r\nand then cast into a dark dungeon and left there without food.\r\nThereupon, at the call of urgent affairs, Maxentius set out for a\r\ndistant province.\r\n\r\nNow the empress, who was a heathen, had a vision, in which Saint\r\nCatherine appeared to her surrounded by a marvellous light. Angels\r\nclad in white were with her, and their faces could not be looked upon\r\nby reason of the brightness that proceeded from them. And Catherine\r\ntold the empress to draw near. Taking a crown from the hand of one of\r\nthe angels who attended her, she placed it upon the head of the\r\nempress, saying: \"Behold a crown sent down to thee from heaven, in the\r\nname of Jesus Christ, my God, and my Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the empress was troubled by this wonderful dream.\r\nWherefore, attended by Porphyrius, a knight who was commander-in-chief\r\nof the army, in the early hours of night she repaired to the prison in\r\nwhich Catherine was confined. Here in her cell a dove brought her\r\nheavenly food, and angels dressed the virgin's wounds. The empress and\r\nPorphyrius found the dungeon bathed in a light so bright that it\r\nfilled them with a great fear, and they fell prostrate on the ground.\r\nBut there straightway filled the dungeon an odour marvellously sweet,\r\nwhich comforted them and gave them courage.\r\n\r\n\"Arise,\" said Catherine, \"and be not afraid, for Jesus Christ calleth\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThey arose, and beheld Catherine in the midst of a choir of angels.\r\nThe saint took from the hands of one among them a crown, very\r\nbeautiful and shining like gold, and she put it upon the empress's\r\nhead. This crown was the sign of martyrdom. For indeed the names of\r\nthis queen and of the knight Porphyrius were already written in the\r\nbook of eternal rewards.\r\n\r\nOn his return Maxentius commanded Catherine to be brought before him,\r\nand said unto her: \"Choose between two things: to sacrifice and live,\r\nor to die in torment.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine made answer: \"It is my desire to offer to Jesus Christ my\r\nflesh and my blood. He is my lover, my shepherd, and my husband.\"\r\n\r\nThen the provost of the city of Alexandria, whose name was Chursates,\r\ncommanded to be made four wheels furnished with very sharp iron\r\nspikes, in order that upon these wheels the blessed Catherine should\r\ndie a miserable and a cruel death. But an angel broke the machine, and\r\nwith such violence that the parts of it flying asunder killed a great\r\nnumber of the Gentiles. And the empress, who beheld these things from\r\nthe top of her tower, came down and reproached the emperor for his\r\ncruelty. Full of wrath, Maxentius commanded the empress to sacrifice;\r\nand when she refused, he commanded her breasts to be torn out and her\r\nhead to be cut off. And while she was being taken to the torturer,\r\nCatherine exhorted her, saying: \"Go, rejoice, queen beloved of God,\r\nfor to-day thou shalt exchange for a perishable kingdom an\r\neverlasting empire, and a mortal husband for an immortal lover.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the empress was taken to suffer death outside the walls.\r\nPorphyrius carried away the body and had it buried reverently as that\r\nof a servant of Jesus Christ. Wherefore Maxentius had Porphyrius put\r\nto death, and his body cast to the dogs. Then, summoning Catherine\r\nbefore him, he said unto her: \"Since, by thy magic arts thou hast\r\ncaused the empress to perish, now if thou repent thou shalt be first\r\nin my palace. To-day, therefore, sacrifice to the gods, or thy head\r\nshall be struck off.\"\r\n\r\nShe made answer: \"Do as thou hast resolved that I may take my place in\r\nthe band of maidens who are around the Lamb of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor sentenced her to be beheaded. And when they had led her\r\noutside the city of Alexandria, to the place of death, she raised her\r\neyes to heaven and said: \"Jesus, hope and salvation of the faithful,\r\nglory and beauty of virgins, I pray thee to listen and to answer the\r\nprayer of whomsoever, in memory of my martyrdom, shall invoke me in\r\ndeath or in peril whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a voice from heaven made answer: \"Come, my beloved bride; the gate\r\nof heaven is open to thee. And to those who shall invoke me through\r\nthy intercession, I promise help from on high.\" From the riven neck of\r\nthe virgin flowed forth milk instead of blood.\r\n\r\nThus Madame Sainte Catherine passed from this world to celestial\r\nhappiness, on the twenty-fifth day of the month of November, which was\r\na Friday.[277]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: Voragine, _La legende doree_, 1846, pp. 789-797.\r\nDouhet, _Dictionnaire des legendes_, 1855, pp. 824-836.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord Saint Michael, the Archangel, did not forget his promise. The\r\nladies Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret came as he had said. On\r\ntheir very first visit the young peasant maid vowed to them to\r\npreserve her virginity as long as it should please God.[278] If there\r\nwere any meaning in such a promise, Jeanne, however old she may then\r\nhave been, could not have been quite a child. And it seems probable\r\nthat the angel and the saints appeared to her first when she was on\r\nthe threshold of womanhood, that is, if she ever became a woman.[279]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 128. Hinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\np. 29. When we come to the trial, we shall consider whether it be\r\npossible to reconcile Jeanne's assertions with regard to this vow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 128; vol. iii, p. 219.]\r\n\r\nThe saints soon entered into familiar relations with her.[280] They\r\ncame to the village every day, and often several times a day. When she\r\nsaw them appear in a ray of light coming down from heaven, shining and\r\nclad like queens, with golden crowns on their heads, wearing rich and\r\nprecious jewels, the village maiden crossed herself devoutly and\r\ncurtsied low.[281] And because they were ladies of good breeding, they\r\nreturned her salutation. Each one had her own particular manner of\r\ngreeting, and it was by this manner that Jeanne distinguished one from\r\nthe other, for the dazzling light of their countenances rendered it\r\nimpossible for her to look them in the face. They graciously permitted\r\ntheir earth-born friend to touch their feet, to kiss the hems of their\r\ngarments, and to inhale rapturously the sweet perfume they\r\nemitted.[282] They addressed her courteously,[283] as it seemed to\r\nJeanne. They called the lowly damsel daughter of God. They taught her\r\nto live well and go to church. Without always having anything very new\r\nto say to her, since they came so constantly, they spoke to her of\r\nthings which filled her with joy, and, after they had disappeared,\r\nJeanne ardently pressed her lips to the ground their feet had\r\ntrodden.[284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: _Ibid._, index, under the words, _Voices_, _Catherine_,\r\nand _Marguerite_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 71-85, 167 _seq._, 186 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: _Ibid._, pp. 185, 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: In the French, _humblement_. In old French _humblement_\r\nmeans courteously. In Froissart there is a passage quoted by La Curne:\r\n\"_Li contes de Hainaut rechut ces seigneurs d'Engleterre, l'un apres\r\nl'autre, moult humblement._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 130.]\r\n\r\nOftentimes she received the heavenly ladies in her little garden,\r\nclose to the precincts of the church. She used to meet them near the\r\nspring; often they even appeared to their little friend surrounded by\r\nheavenly companies. \"For,\" Isabelle's daughter used to say, \"angels\r\nare wont to come down to Christians without being seen, but I see\r\nthem.\"[285] It was in the woods, amid the light rustling of the\r\nleaves, and especially when the bells rang for matins or compline,\r\nthat she heard the sweet words most distinctly. And so she loved the\r\nsound of the bells, with which her Voices mingled. So, when at nine\r\no'clock in the evening, Perrin le Drapier, sexton of the parish,\r\nforgot to ring for compline, she reproached him with his negligence,\r\nand scolded him for not doing his duty. She promised him cakes if in\r\nthe future he would not forget to ring the bells.[286]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: _Ibid._, p. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 413, note 2.]\r\n\r\nShe told none of these things to her priest; for this, according to\r\nsome good doctors, she must be censured, but, according to others\r\nequally excellent, she must be commended. For if on the one hand we\r\nare to consult our ecclesiastical superiors in matters of faith, on\r\nthe other, where the gift of the Holy Ghost is poured out, there\r\nreigns perfect liberty.[287]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52, marginal comment of the d'Urfe\r\nMS.: _Celavit visiones curato, patri et matri et cuicumque_, in the\r\n_Trial_, vol. i, p. 128, note. Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et\r\nconsultations en faveur de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 471.]\r\n\r\nSince the two saints had been visiting Jeanne, my Lord Saint Michael\r\nhad come less often; but he had not forsaken her. There came a time\r\nwhen he talked to her of love for the kingdom of France, of that love\r\nwhich she felt in her heart.[288]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 171: \"_Et luy racontet l'angle la\r\npitie qui estoit ou royaume de France._\" _Pitie_ means here occasion\r\nfor tenderness and love. The angel is thinking especially of the\r\nDauphin. For the meaning and use of this word, cf. Monstrelet, vol.\r\niii, p. 74: \"_... et le peuple plorant de pitie et de joie qu'ils\r\navoient a regarder leur seigneur_.\" Gerard de Nevers in La Curne:\r\n\"_Pitie estoit de voir festoyer leur seigneur; on ne pourroit retenir\r\nses larmes en voyant la joie qu'ils marquoient de recevoir leur\r\nseigneur._\"]\r\n\r\nAnd the holy visitants, whose voices grew stronger and more ardent as\r\nthe maiden's soul grew holier and more heroic, revealed to her her\r\nmission. \"Daughter of God,\" they said, \"thou must leave thy village,\r\nand go to France.\"[289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nHad this idea of a holy militant mission, conceived by Jeanne through\r\nthe intermediary of her Voices, come into her mind spontaneously\r\nwithout the intervention of any outside will, or had it been suggested\r\nto her by some one who was influencing her? It would be impossible to\r\nsolve this problem were there not a slight indication to direct us.\r\nJeanne at Domremy was acquainted with a prophecy foretelling that\r\nFrance would be ruined by a woman and saved by a maiden.[290] It made\r\nan extraordinary impression upon her; and later she came to speak in a\r\nmanner which proved that she not only believed it, but was persuaded\r\nthat she herself was the maiden designated by the prophecy.[291] Who\r\ntaught her this? Some peasant? We have reason to believe that the\r\npeasants did not know it, and that it was current among\r\necclesiastics.[292] Besides, it is important to notice in this\r\nconnection that Jeanne was acquainted with a particular form of this\r\nprophecy, obviously arranged for her benefit, since it specified that\r\nthe Maiden Redemptress should come from the borders of Lorraine. This\r\nlocal addition is not the work of a cowherd; it suggests rather a mind\r\napt to direct souls and to inspire deeds. It is no longer possible to\r\ndoubt that the prophecy thus revised is the work of an ecclesiastic\r\nwhose intentions may be easily divined. Henceforth one is conscious of\r\nan idea agitating and possessing the young seer of visions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: \"_Nonne alias dictum fuit quod Francia per mulierem\r\ndesolaretur, et postea per Virginem restaurari debebat?_\" Evidence\r\ngiven by Durand Lassois in _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 447. Nevertheless the woman Le\r\nRoyer of Domremy remembered it and was astonished by it. _Et hunc ipsa\r\ntestis haec audisse recordata est et stupefacta fuit._]\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Meuse, among the humble folk of the countryside,\r\nsome churchman, preoccupied with the lot of the poor people of France,\r\ndirected Jeanne's visions to the welfare of the kingdom and to the\r\nconclusion of peace. He carried the ardour of his pious zeal so far as\r\nto collect prophecies concerning the salvation of the French crown,\r\nand to add to them with an eye to the accomplishment of his design.\r\nFor such an ecclesiastic we must seek among the priests of Lorraine\r\nor Champagne upon whom the national misfortunes imposed cruel\r\nsufferings.[293] Merchants and artizans, crushed under the burden of\r\ntaxes and subsidies, and ruined by changes in the coinage,[294]\r\npeasants, whose houses, barns, and mills had been destroyed, and whose\r\nfields had been laid waste, no longer contributed to the expenses of\r\npublic worship.[295] Canons and ecclesiastics, deprived both of their\r\nfeudal dues and of the contributions of the faithful, quitted the\r\nreligious houses and set out to beg their bread from door to door,\r\nleaving behind in the monasteries only two or three old monks, and a\r\nfew children. The fortified abbeys attracted captains and soldiers of\r\nboth sides. They entrenched themselves within the walls; they\r\nplundered and burnt. When one of those holy houses succeeded in\r\nremaining standing, the wandering village folk made it their place of\r\nrefuge, and it was impossible to prevent the refectories and\r\ndormitories from being invaded by women.[296] In the midst of this\r\nobscure throng of souls afflicted by the sufferings and the scandals\r\nof the Church may be divined the prophet and the director of the Maid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: Monstrelet, vol. iii, p. 180.

The successor of Messire Jean Minet, if we\r\nmay judge from his conversation which has been preserved, was as\r\nsimple as his flock.[297] Jeanne saw many priests and monks. She was\r\nin the habit of visiting her uncle, the priest of Sermaize, and of\r\nseeing in the Abbey of Cheminon,[298] her cousin, a young ecclesiastic\r\nin minor orders, who was soon to follow her into France. She was in\r\ntouch with a number of priests who would be very quick to recognise\r\nher exceptional piety, and her gift of beholding things invisible to\r\nthe majority of Christians. They engaged her in conversations, which,\r\nhad they been preserved, would doubtless present to us one of the\r\nsources whence she derived inspiration for her marvellous vocation.\r\nOne among them, whose name will never be known, raised up an angelic\r\ndeliverer for the king and the kingdom of France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 402, 434.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: These two persons, however, are only known to us\r\nthrough somewhat doubtful genealogical documents. _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n252.

Knowing nothing of the\r\ninfluences she was under, incapable of recognising in her Voices the\r\necho of a human voice or the promptings of her own heart, she\r\nresponded timidly to the saints when they bade her fare forth into\r\nFrance: \"I am a poor girl, and know not how to ride a horse or how to\r\nmake war.\"[299]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 52, 53.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as she began to receive these revelations she gave up her\r\ngames and her excursions. Henceforth she seldom danced round the\r\nfairies' tree, and then only in play with the children.[300] It would\r\nseem that she also took a dislike to working in the fields, and\r\nespecially to herding the flocks. From early childhood she had shown\r\nsigns of piety. Now she gave herself up to extreme devoutness; she\r\nconfessed frequently, and communicated with ecstatic fervour; she\r\nheard mass in her parish church every day. At all hours she was to be\r\nfound in church, sometimes prostrate on the ground, sometimes with her\r\nhands clasped, and her face turned towards the image of Our Lord or of\r\nOur Lady. She did not always wait for Saturday to visit the chapel at\r\nBermont. Sometimes, when her parents thought she was tending the\r\nherds, she was kneeling at the feet of the miracle-working Virgin. The\r\nvillage priest, Messire Guillaume Frontey, could do nothing but praise\r\nthe most guileless of his parishioners.[301] One day he happened to\r\nsay with a sigh: \"If Jeannette had money she would give it to me for\r\nthe saying of masses.\"[302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 404, 407, 409, 411, 414, 416,\r\n_passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 402, 434.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: _Ibid._, p. 402. Concerning Jeanne's religious\r\nobservances, see _Ibid._, index, under the words _Messe_, _Vierge_,\r\n_Cloche_.]\r\n\r\nAs for the good man, Jacques d'Arc, it is possible that he may have\r\noccasionally complained of those pilgrimages, those meditations, and\r\nthose other practices which ill accorded with the ordinary tenor of\r\ncountry life. Every one thought Jeanne odd and erratic. Mengette and\r\nher friends, when they found her so devout, said she was too\r\npious.[303] They scolded her for not dancing with them. Among others,\r\nIsabellette, the young wife of Gerardin d'Epinal, the mother of little\r\nNicholas, Jeanne's godson, roundly condemned a girl who cared so\r\nlittle for dancing.[304] Colin, son of Jean Colin, and all the\r\nvillage lads made fun of her piety. Her fits of religious ecstasy\r\nraised a smile. She was regarded as a little mad. She suffered from\r\nthis persistent raillery.[305] But with her own eyes she beheld the\r\ndwellers in Paradise. And when they left her she would cry and wish\r\nthat they had taken her with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: _Ibid._, p. 427.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 432.]\r\n\r\n\"Daughter of God, thou must leave thy village and go forth into\r\nFrance.\"[306]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 52, 53.]\r\n\r\nAnd the ladies Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret spoke again and\r\nsaid: \"Take the standard sent down to thee by the King of Heaven, take\r\nit boldly and God will help thee.\" As she listened to these words of\r\nthe ladies with the beautiful crowns, Jeanne was consumed with a\r\ndesire for long expeditions on horseback, and for those battles in\r\nwhich angels hover over the heads of the warriors. But how was she to\r\ngo to France? How was she to associate with men-at-arms? Ignorant and\r\ngenerously impulsive like herself, the Voices she heard merely\r\nrevealed to her her own heart, and left her in sad agitation of mind:\r\n\"I am a poor girl, knowing neither how to bestride a horse nor how to\r\nmake war.\"[307]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: _Ibid._, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nJeanne's native village was named after the blessed Remi;[308] the\r\nparish church bore the name of the great apostle of the Gauls, who, in\r\nbaptising King Clovis, had anointed with holy oil the first Christian\r\nprince of the noble House of France, descended from the noble King\r\nPriam of Troy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 393, 400, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThus runs the legend of Saint Remi as it was told by churchmen. In\r\nthose days the pious hermit Montan, who lived in the country of Laon,\r\nbeheld a choir of angels and an assembly of saints; and he heard a\r\nvoice full and sweet saying: \"The Lord hath looked down upon the\r\nearth. That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that\r\nhe might release the children of the slain: that they may declare the\r\nname of the Lord in Sion: and his praise in Jerusalem. When the people\r\nassemble together, and kings to serve the Lord.[309] And Cilinia shall\r\nbring forth a son for the saving of the people.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: Psalm ci, 20-23. _Vulgate_, Douai Version (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nNow Cilinia was old, and her husband Emilius was blind. Yet Cilinia,\r\nhaving conceived, brought forth a son; and with the milk with which\r\nshe nourished her babe she rubbed the eyes of the father, and\r\nstraightway his eyes were opened, and he saw.\r\n\r\nThis child, whose birth had been foretold by angels, was called Remi,\r\nwhich, being interpreted, means oar; for by his teaching, as with a\r\nwell-cut oar, he was to guide the Church of God, and especially the\r\nchurch of Reims, over the stormy sea of life, and by his merits and\r\nhis prayers bring it into the heaven of eternal salvation.\r\n\r\nIn retirement and in the practice of holy and Christian observances,\r\nCilinia's son passed his pious youth at Laon. Hardly had he entered\r\nhis twenty-second year, when the episcopal seat of Reims fell vacant\r\non the death of the blessed Bishop Bennade. An immense concourse of\r\npeople nominated Remi the shepherd of the flock. He refused a burden\r\nwhich he said was too heavy for the weakness of his youth. But\r\nsuddenly there fell upon his forehead a ray of celestial light, and a\r\ndivine liquid was shed upon his hair, and scented it with a strange\r\nperfume. Wherefore, without further delay, the bishops of the\r\nprovince of Reims, with one consent, consecrated him their bishop.\r\nEstablished in the seat of Saint Sixtus, the blessed Remi revealed\r\nhimself liberal in almsgiving, assiduous in vigilance, fervent in\r\nprayer, perfect in charity, marvellous in doctrine, and holy in all\r\nhis conversation. Like a city built on the top of a mountain, he was\r\nadmired of all men.\r\n\r\nIn those days, Clovis, King of France, was a heathen, with all his\r\nknights. But he had won a great victory over the Germans by invoking\r\nthe name of Christ. Wherefore, at the entreaty of the saintly Queen\r\nClotilde, his wife, he resolved to ask baptism at the hands of the\r\nblessed Bishop of Reims. When this pious desire had been made known to\r\nhim, Saint Remi taught the King and his subjects that, renouncing\r\nSatan and his pomps and his works, they must believe in God and in\r\nJesus Christ his Son. And as the solemn festival of Easter was\r\napproaching, he commanded them to fast according to the custom of the\r\nfaithful. On the day of the Passion of Our Lord, the eve of the day on\r\nwhich Clovis was to be baptised, early in the morning the Bishop went\r\nto the King and Queen and led them to an oratory dedicated to the\r\nblessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles. Suddenly the chapel was filled\r\nwith a light so brilliant that the sunshine became as shadow, and from\r\nthe midst of this light there came a voice saying: \"Peace be with you,\r\nit is I, fear not and abide in my love.\" After these words the light\r\nfaded, but there remained in the chapel an odour of ineffable\r\nsweetness. Then, with his face shining like the countenance of Moses,\r\nand illuminated within by a divine brightness, the holy Bishop\r\nprophesied and said: \"Clovis and Clotilde, your descendants shall set\r\nback the boundaries of the kingdom. They shall raise the church of\r\nJesus Christ and triumph over foreign nations provided they fall not\r\nfrom virtue and depart not from the way of salvation, neither enter\r\nupon the sinful road leading to destruction and to those snares of\r\ndeadly vices which overthrow empires and cause dominion to pass from\r\none nation to another.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the way is being prepared from the King's palace to the\r\nbaptistry; curtains and costly draperies are hung up: the houses on\r\neach side of the street are covered with hangings; the church is\r\ndecorated, and the baptistry is strewn with balsam and all manner of\r\nsweet-smelling herbs. Overwhelmed with the Lord's favour the people\r\nseem already to taste the delights of Paradise. The procession sets\r\nout from the palace; the clergy lead with crosses and banners, singing\r\nhymns and sacred canticles; then comes the Bishop leading the King by\r\nthe hand; and lastly the Queen follows with the people. By the way the\r\nKing asked the Bishop if yonder was the kingdom of God he had promised\r\nhim. \"No,\" answered the blessed Remi, \"but it is the beginning of the\r\nroad that leads to it.\" When they had reached the baptistry, the\r\npriest who bore the holy chrism was hindered by the crowd from\r\nreaching the sacred font; so that, as God had ordained, there was no\r\nholy oil for the benediction at the font. Then the Pontiff raises his\r\neyes to heaven, and prays in silence and in tears. Straightway there\r\ndescends a dove white as snow, bearing in its beak an ampulla full of\r\nchrism sent from heaven. The heavenly oil emits a delicious perfume,\r\nwhich intoxicates the multitude with a delight such as they had never\r\nexperienced before that hour. The holy Bishop takes the ampulla,\r\nsprinkles the baptismal water with chrism, and straightway the dove\r\nvanishes.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of so great a miracle of grace, the King, transported\r\nwith joy, renounces Satan and his pomps and his works. He demands\r\ninstant baptism, and bends over the fountain of life.[310]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: Gregoire de Tours, _Le livre des miracles_, ed.\r\nBordier, 1864, in 8vo, vol. ii, pp. 27, 31. Hincmar, _Vita sancti\r\nRemigii_ in the _Patrologie de Migne_, vol. cxxv, pp. 1130 _et seq._\r\nH. Jadart, _Bibliographie des ouvrages concernant la vie et le culte\r\nde saint Remi, eveque de Reims_, 1891, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nEver since then the kings of France have been anointed with the divine\r\noil which the dove brought down from heaven. The holy ampulla\r\ncontaining it is kept in the church of Saint Remi at Reims. And by\r\nGod's grace on the day of the King's anointing this ampulla is always\r\nfound full.[311]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: Froissart, Bk. II, ch. lxxiv. Le doyen de\r\nSaint-Thibaud, p. 328.

We may believe that\r\nthey used to sing the complaint of Saint Remi. Every year, when on the\r\n1st of October the festival of the patron saint came round, the priest\r\nwas wont to pronounce an eulogium on the saint.[312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: A. Monteil, _Histoire des Francais_, 1853, vol. ii, p.\r\n194.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a mystery was performed at Reims in which the miracles\r\nof the apostle of Gaul were fully represented.[313]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: _Mystere de saint Remi_, Arsenal Library, ms. no.\r\n3.364. This mystery dates from the fifteenth century, from the time of\r\nthe wars in Champagne. The following lines relate to the misfortunes\r\nof the kingdom:\r\n\r\n    SAINT-ESTIENNE\r\n\r\n    O Jhesucrist, qui les sains cieulx\r\n    As de lumiere environnez,\r\n    Soleil et lune enlumines,\r\n    Et ordonnez a ta plaisance;\r\n    Pour le tres doulz pais de France\r\n    Les martirs, non pas un mais tous,\r\n    A jointes mains et a genoux\r\n    Te requierent que tu effaces\r\n    La grant doleur de France; et faces\r\n    Par ta sainte digne vertu\r\n    Qu'ilz aient paix; adfin que tu,\r\n    Ta doulce mere et tous les sains,\r\n    Et ceulx qui sont de pechiez sains,\r\n    Devotement servis y soient!...\r\n\r\nSAINT STEPHEN\r\n\r\nO Jesus Christ who hast surrounded the heavens with light and kindled\r\nthe sun and the moon, command, if it be thy will, the martyrs, not one\r\nonly but all, to clasp their hands and on bended knee to implore thee\r\nto remove the great sorrow from France; and by thy holy and august\r\nmerit ordain that they may have peace, that thou, thy sweet mother and\r\nall the saints and those who are cleansed from sin may be served\r\ndevoutly!...\r\n\r\n    SAINT-NICOLAS\r\n\r\n    Dieu tout puissant fay tant qu'il ysse\r\n    Hors du doulz pais sans amer\r\n    Que toutes gens doivent amer\r\n    C'est France, ou sont les bons Chrestiens\r\n    S'on les confort; si les soustiens\r\n    Car l'engin de leur adversaire\r\n    Et son faulx art les tire a faire\r\n    Contre ta sainte voulente.\r\n    Ayez pitie de Crestiente\r\n    Beau sire Dieux\r\n    Tant en France qu'en autres lieux!\r\n    Ce seroit Pitie a oultrance\r\n    Que si noble roiaume, comme France,\r\n    Fust par male temptacion\r\n    Mis du tout a perdicion....\r\n\r\n    Fol. 3, verso.\r\n\r\nSAINT NICHOLAS\r\n\r\nGod all powerful grant that he may issue forth from that sweet land\r\nwhich all must love, all France, where are good Christians, and may\r\nthey be comforted, and may they be sustained; for the power of their\r\nadversary and his false art tempt them to withstand thy holy will.\r\nHave pity on Christendom, good lord God, on other lands as well as on\r\nFrance! It would be the worst of pities if so noble a kingdom as\r\nFrance were through much temptation to fall into perdition....]\r\n\r\nAnd among them were some which would appeal strongly to rustic souls.\r\nIn his mortal life my Lord Saint Remi had healed a blind man possessed\r\nof devils. A man bestowed his goods on the chapter of Reims for the\r\nsalvation of his soul and died; ten years after his death Saint Remi\r\nrestored him to life, and made him declare his gift. Being\r\nentertained by persons who had nothing to drink, the saint filled\r\ntheir cask with miraculous wine. He received from King Clovis the gift\r\nof a mill; but when the miller refused to yield it up to him, my Lord\r\nSaint Remi, by the power of God, threw down the mill, and cast it into\r\nthe centre of the earth. One night when the Saint was alone in his\r\nchapel, while all his clerks were asleep, the glorious apostles Peter\r\nand Paul came down from Paradise to sing matins with him.\r\n\r\nWho better than the folk of Domremy should know of the baptism of King\r\nClovis of France, and of the descent of the Holy Ghost, at the singing\r\nof Veni Creator Spiritus, bearing in its beak the holy ampulla, full\r\nof chrism blessed by Our Lord?[314]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: _Mystere de Saint Remi_, Arsenal Library, ms. no.\r\n3.364, fol. 69, verso.]\r\n\r\nWho better than they should understand the words addressed to the very\r\nChristian King, by my Lord Saint Remi, not doubtless in the Church's\r\nLatin, but in the good tongue of the people and very much like the\r\nfollowing: \"Now, Sire, take knowledge and serve God faithfully and\r\njudge justly, that thy kingdom may prosper. For if justice depart from\r\nit then shall this kingdom be in danger of perdition.\"[315]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: _Mystere de Saint Remi_, fol. 71, verso.]\r\n\r\nIn short, in one way or another, whether through the clerks who\r\ndirected her or through the peasants among whom she dwelt, Jeanne had\r\nknowledge of the good Archbishop Remi, who so dearly cherished the\r\nroyal blood in the holy ampulla at Reims, and of the anointing of the\r\nvery Christian kings.[316]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316:\r\n\r\n    _Le bon archevesque Remy,\r\n    Qui tant aime le sang royal,\r\n    Qui tant a son conseil loyal,\r\n    Qui tant aime Dieu et l'Eglise._\r\n\r\n    _Mystere de Saint Remi_, fol. 77.\r\n\r\nThe good Archbishop Remi, who so dearly cherishes the _royal_ blood,\r\nso faithful in counsel, so devout a lover of God and the Church.]\r\n\r\nAnd the Angel appeared unto her and said: \"Daughter of God, thou shalt\r\nlead the Dauphin to Reims that he may there receive worthily his\r\nanointing.\"[317]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nThe maid understood. The scales fell from her eyes; a bright light was\r\nshed abroad in her mind. Behold wherefore God had chosen her. Through\r\nher the Dauphin Charles was to be anointed at Reims. The white dove,\r\nwhich of old was sent to the blessed Remi, was to come down again at\r\nthe Virgin's call. God, who loves the French, marks their king with a\r\nsign, and when there is no sign the royal power has departed. The\r\nanointing alone makes the king, and Messire Charles de Valois had not\r\nbeen anointed. Notwithstanding the father lies becrowned and\r\nbesceptred in the basilica of Saint-Denys in France, the son is but\r\nthe dauphin and will not enter into his inheritance till the day when\r\nthe oil of the inexhaustible ampulla shall flow over his forehead. And\r\nGod has chosen her, a young, ignorant peasant maid, to lead him,\r\nthrough the ranks of his enemies, to Reims, where he shall receive the\r\nunction poured upon Saint Louis. Unfathomable ways of God! The humble\r\nmaid, knowing not how to ride a horse, unskilled in the arts of war,\r\nis chosen to bring to Our Lord his temporal vicar of Christian France.\r\n\r\nHenceforth Jeanne knew what great deeds she was to bring to pass. But\r\nas yet she discerned not the means by which she was to accomplish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Thou must fare forth into France,\" Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret\r\nsaid to her.\r\n\r\n\"Daughter of God, thou shalt lead the Dauphin to Reims[318] that he\r\nmay there receive worthily his anointing,\" the Archangel Michael said\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 130; vol. ii, p. 456; vol. iii, p.\r\n3, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nShe must obey them--but how? If at that time there were not just at\r\nhand some devout adviser to direct her, one incident quite personal\r\nand unimportant, which then occurred in her father's house, may have\r\nsufficed to point out the way to the young saint.\r\n\r\nTenant-in-chief of the Castle on the island in 1419, and in 1423 elder\r\nof the community, Jacques d'Arc was one of the notables of Domremy.\r\nThe village folk held him in high esteem and readily entrusted him\r\nwith difficult tasks. Towards the end of March, 1427, they sent him to\r\nVaucouleurs as their authorised proxy in a lawsuit they were\r\nconducting before Robert de Baudricourt. It was a question of the\r\npayment of damages required at once from the lord and the inhabitants\r\nof Greux and Domremy by a certain Guyot Poignant, of Montigny-le-Roi.\r\nThese damages went back four years to when, as a return for his\r\nprotection, the Damoiseau of Commercy had extorted from Greux and\r\nDomremy a sum amounting to two hundred and twenty golden crowns.\r\n\r\nGuyot Poignant had become security for this sum which had not been\r\npaid by the time fixed. The Damoiseau seized Poignant's wood, hay, and\r\nhorses to the value of one hundred and twenty golden crowns, which\r\namount the said Poignant reclaimed from the nobles and villeins of\r\nGreux and Domremy. The suit was still pending in 1427, when the\r\ncommunity nominated Jacques d'Arc its authorised proxy, and sent him\r\nto Vaucouleurs. The result of the dispute is not known; but it is\r\nsufficient to note that Jeanne's father saw Sire Robert and had speech\r\nwith him.[319]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. cliv, clv, clvi,\r\n97, 359 _et seq._; _La France pendant la guerre de cent ans_, p. 287.]\r\n\r\nOn his return home he must have more than once related these\r\ninterviews, and told of the manners and words of so great a personage.\r\nAnd doubtless Jeanne heard many of these things. Assuredly she must\r\nhave pricked up her ears at the name of Baudricourt. Then it was that\r\nher dazzling friend, the Archangel Knight, came once more to awaken\r\nthe obscure thought slumbering within her: \"Daughter of God,\" he said,\r\n\"go thou to the Captain Robert de Baudricourt, in the town of\r\nVaucouleurs, that he may grant unto thee men who shall take thee to\r\nthe gentle Dauphin.\"[320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nResolved to obey faithfully the behest of the Archangel which\r\naccorded with her own desire, Jeanne foresaw that her mother, albeit\r\npious, would grant her no aid in her design and that her father would\r\nstrongly oppose it. Therefore she refrained from confiding it to\r\nthem.[321]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 128.]\r\n\r\nShe thought that Durand Lassois would be the man to give her the\r\nsuccour of which she had need. In consideration of his age she called\r\nhim uncle,--he was her elder by sixteen years.\r\n\r\nTheir kinship was by marriage: Lassois had married one Jeanne,\r\ndaughter of one Le Vauseul, husbandman, and of Aveline, sister of\r\nIsabelle de Vouthon, and consequently cousin-german of Isabelle's\r\ndaughter.[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 443. Boucher de Molandon, _La\r\nfamille de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 146. E. de Bouteiller and G. de Braux,\r\n_Nouvelles recherches sur la famille de Jeanne d'Arc_, introduction,\r\npp. xxi, xxii.]\r\n\r\nWith his wife, his father-in-law, and his mother-in-law, Lassois dwelt\r\nat Burey-en-Vaulx, a hamlet of a few homesteads, lying on the left\r\nbank of the Meuse, in the green valley, five miles from Domremy, and\r\nless than two and a half miles from Vaucouleurs.[323]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 411, 431, 439. S. Luce, _Jeanne\r\nd'Arc a Domremy_, p. clxi. Hinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nJeanne went to see him, told him of her design, and showed him that\r\nshe must needs see Sire Robert de Baudricourt. That her kind kinsman\r\nmight the more readily believe in her, she repeated to him the strange\r\nprophecy, of which we have already made mention: \"Was it not known of\r\nold,\" she said, \"that a woman should ruin the kingdom of France and\r\nthat a woman should re-establish it?\"[324]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 443, 444.]\r\n\r\nThis prognostication, it appears, caused Durand Lassois to reflect.\r\nOf the two facts foretold therein, the first, the evil one, had come\r\nto pass in the town of Troyes, when Madame Ysabeau had given the\r\nKingdom of the Lilies and Madame Catherine of France to the King of\r\nEngland. It only remained to hope that the second, the good, would\r\nlikewise come to pass. If in the heart of Durand Lassois there were\r\nany love for the Dauphin Charles, such must have been his desire; but\r\non this point history is silent.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to her cousin, Jeanne met with others besides her\r\nkinsfolk, the Vouthons and their children. She visited a young\r\nnobleman, by name Geoffroy de Foug, who dwelt in the parish of\r\nMaxey-sur-Vayse, of which the hamlet of Burey formed part. She\r\nconfided to him that she wanted to go to France. My Lord Geoffroy did\r\nnot know much of Jeanne's parents; he was ignorant even of their\r\nnames. But the damsel seemed to him good, simple, pious, and he\r\nencouraged her in her marvellous undertaking.[325] A week after her\r\narrival at Burey she attained her object: Durand Lassois consented to\r\ntake her to Vaucouleurs.[326]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 442.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 53, 221; vol. ii, p. 443.]\r\n\r\nBefore starting she asked a favour from her aunt Aveline who was with\r\nchild; she said to her: \"If the babe you bear is a daughter, call her\r\nCatherine in memory of my dead sister.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine, who had married Colin de Greux, had just died.[327]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: Genealogical Inquiry made by the Bailie of Chaumont\r\nconcerning Jehan Royer (8 October, 1555) in E. de Bouteiller and G. de\r\nBraux, _Nouvelles recherches sur la famille de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 62.\r\n[Document of doubtful authenticity.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFIRST VISIT TO VAUCOULEURS--FLIGHT TO NEUFCHATEAU--JOURNEY TO\r\nTOUL--SECOND VISIT TO VAUCOULEURS\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert de Baudricourt, who in those days commanded the town of\r\nVaucouleurs for the Dauphin Charles, was the son of Liebault de\r\nBaudricourt deceased, once chamberlain of Robert, Duke of Bar,\r\ngovernor of Pont-a-Mousson, and of Marguerite d'Aunoy, Lady of Blaise\r\nin Bassigny. Fourteen or fifteen years earlier he had succeeded his\r\ntwo uncles, Guillaume, the Bastard of Poitiers, and Jean d'Aunoy as\r\nBailie of Chaumont and Commander of Vaucouleurs. His first wife had\r\nbeen a rich widow; after her death he had married, in 1425, another\r\nwidow, as rich as the first, Madame Alarde de Chambley. And it is a\r\nfact that the peasants of Uruffe and of Gibeaumex stole the cart\r\ncarrying the cakes ordered for the wedding feast. Sire Robert was like\r\nall the warriors of his time and country; he was greedy and cunning;\r\nhe had many friends among his enemies and many enemies among his\r\nfriends; he fought now for his own side, now against it, but always\r\nfor his own advantage. For the rest he was no worse than his fellows,\r\nand one of the least stupid.[328]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 271. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 67. Le R.P.

Les Baudricourt_,\r\nParis, 1903, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nClad in a poor red gown,[329] but her heart bright with mystic love,\r\nJeanne climbed the hill dominating the town and the valley. Without\r\nany difficulty she entered the castle, for its gates were opened as\r\nfreely as if it had been a fair; and she was led into the hall where\r\nwas Sire Robert among his men-at-arms. She heard the Voice saying to\r\nher: \"That is he!\"[330] And immediately she went straight to him, and\r\nspoke to him fearlessly, beginning, doubtless, by saying what she\r\ndeemed to be most urgent: \"I am come to you, sent by Messire,\" she\r\nsaid, \"that you may send to the Dauphin and tell him to hold himself\r\nin readiness, but not to give battle to his enemies.\"[331]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 436.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 456.]\r\n\r\nAssuredly she must thus have spoken, prompted by a new revelation from\r\nher Voices. And it is important to notice that she repeated word for\r\nword what had been said seventy-five years earlier, not far from\r\nVaucouleurs, by a peasant of Champagne who was a vavasour, that is, a\r\nfreeman. This peasant's career had begun like Jeanne's, but had come\r\nto a much more abrupt conclusion. Jacques d'Arc's daughter had not\r\nbeen the first to say that revelations had been made to her concerning\r\nthe war. Periods of great distress are the times when inspired persons\r\nmost commonly appear. Thus it came to pass that in the days of the\r\nPlague and of the Black Prince the vavasour of Champagne heard a voice\r\ncoming forth from a beam of light.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at work in the fields the voice had said to him: \"Go\r\nthou, and warn John, King of France, that he fight not against any of\r\nhis enemies.\" It was a few days before the Battle of Poitiers.[332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: _Chronique des quatre premiers Valois_, ed. S. Luce,\r\nParis, 1861, in 8vo, pp. 46-48.]\r\n\r\nThen the counsel was wise; but in the month of May, 1428, it seemed\r\nless wise, and appeared to have little bearing on the state of affairs\r\nat that time. Since the disaster of Verneuil, the French had not felt\r\nequal to giving battle to their enemies; and they were not thinking of\r\nit. Towns were taken and lost, skirmishes were fought, sallies were\r\nattempted, but the enemy was not engaged in pitched battles. There was\r\nno need to restrain the Dauphin Charles, whom in those days nature and\r\nfortune rendered unadventurous.[333] About the time that Jeanne was\r\nuttering these words before Sire Robert, the English in France were\r\npreparing an expedition, and were hesitating, unable to decide whether\r\nto march on Angers or on Orleans.[334]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: P. de Fenin, _Memoires_, ed. Mademoiselle Dupont,\r\nParis, 1837, pp. 195, 222, 223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: L. Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise au siege\r\nd'Orleans_, Orleans, 1892, in 8vo, pp. 75, 76.]\r\n\r\nJeanne gave utterance according to the promptings of her Archangel and\r\nher Saints, and touching warfare and the condition of the kingdom they\r\nknew neither more nor less than she. But it is not surprising that\r\nthose who believe themselves sent by God should ask to be waited for.\r\nAnd again in the damsel's fear lest the French knights should once\r\nmore give battle after their own guise there was much of the sound\r\ncommon sense of the people. They were only too well acquainted with\r\nknightly warfare.\r\n\r\nPerfectly calm and self-possessed, Jeanne went on and uttered a\r\nprophecy concerning the Dauphin: \"Before mid Lent my Lord will grant\r\nhim aid.\" Then straightway she added: \"But in very deed the realm\r\nbelongs not to the Dauphin. Nathless it is Messire's will that the\r\nDauphin should be king and receive the kingdom in trust--_en\r\ncommande_.[335] Notwithstanding his enemies, the Dauphin shall be\r\nking; and it is I who shall lead him to his anointing.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: _Et quod aberet in commendam: illud regnum_, _Trial_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 456 (evidence of Bertrand de Poulengy).]\r\n\r\nDoubtless the title Messire, in the sense in which she employed it,\r\nsounded strange and obscure, since Sire Robert, failing to understand\r\nit, asked: \"Who is Messire?\"\r\n\r\n\"The King of Heaven,\" the damsel answered.\r\n\r\nShe had made use of another term, concerning which, as far as we know,\r\nSire Robert made no remark; and yet it is suggestive.[336]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 456.]\r\n\r\nThat word _commande_ employed in matters connected with inheritance\r\nsignified something given in trust.[337] If the King received the\r\nkingdom _en commande_ he would merely hold it in trust. Thus the\r\nmaid's utterance agreed with the views of the most pious concerning\r\nOur Lord's government of kingdoms. By herself she could not have\r\nhappened on the word or the idea; she had obviously been instructed by\r\none of those churchmen whose influence we have discerned already[338]\r\nin the Lorraine prophecy, but the trace of whom has completely\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: See La Curne and Godefroy for the word _commande_.\r\nDurand de Maillane, _Dictionnaire de droit canonique_, 1770, vol. i,\r\npp. 567 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: See _ante_, p. 59, _post_, pp. 177, 178.]\r\n\r\nTouching things spiritual Jeanne held converse with several priests;\r\namong others with Messire Arnolin, of Gondrecourt-le-Chateau, and\r\nMessire Dominique Jacob, priest of Moutier-sur-Saulx, who was her\r\nconfessor.[339] It is a pity we do not know what these ecclesiastics\r\nthought of the insatiable cruelty of the English, of the pride of my\r\nLord Duke of Burgundy, of the misfortunes of the Dauphin, and whether\r\nthey did not hope that one day Our Lord Jesus Christ at the prayer of\r\nthe common folk would condescend to grant the kingdom _en commande_ to\r\nCharles, son of Charles. It was possibly from one of these that Jeanne\r\nderived her theocratic ideas.[340]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 392, 393, 458, 459.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: As for Nicolas de Vouthon, priest of the Abbey of\r\nCheminon, what is stated concerning him in the evidence of the 2nd and\r\n3rd November, 1476, seems improbable. _Trial_, vol. v, p. 252. E. de\r\nBouteiller and G. de Braux, _Nouvelles recherches sur la famille de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, pp. xviii _et seq._, 9.]\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking to Sire Robert there was present, and not by\r\nchance merely, a certain knight of Lorraine, Bertrand de Poulengy, who\r\npossessed lands near Gondrecourt and held an office in the provostship\r\nof Vaucouleurs.[341] He was then about thirty-six years of age. He was\r\na man who associated with churchmen; at least he was familiar with the\r\nmanner of speech of devout persons.[342] Perhaps he now saw Jeanne\r\nfor the first time; but he must certainly have heard of her; and he\r\nknew her to be good and pious. Twelve years before he had frequently\r\nvisited Domremy; he knew the country well; he had sat beneath _l'Arbre\r\ndes Dames_, and had been several times to the house of Jacques d'Arc\r\nand Romee, whom he held to be good honest farmer folk.[343]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 475. Servais, in _Memoires de la\r\nSociete des Lettres, Sciences et Arts de Bar-le-Duc_, vol. vi, p. 139.\r\nE. de Bouteiller and G. de Braux, _Nouvelles recherches_, p. xxviii.\r\nS. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, proofs and illustrations xcv, p.\r\n143 and note 3. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p.\r\n204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: This appears from the manner in which he reports\r\nJeanne's words.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 451, 458.]\r\n\r\nIt may be that Bertrand de Poulengy was struck by the damsel's speech\r\nand bearing; it is more likely that the knight was in touch with\r\ncertain ecclesiastics unknown to us, who were instructing the peasant\r\nseeress with an eye to rendering her better able to serve the realm of\r\nFrance and the Church. However that may be, in Bertrand she had a\r\nfriend who was to be her strong support in the future.\r\n\r\nFor the nonce, however, if our information be correct, he did nothing\r\nand spoke not a word. Perhaps he judged it best to wait until the\r\ncommander of the town should be ready to grant a more favourable\r\nhearing to the saint's request. Sire Robert understood nothing of all\r\nthis; one point only appeared plain to him, that Jeanne would make a\r\nfine camp-follower and that she would be a great favourite with the\r\nmen-at-arms.[344]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 72. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 35.]\r\n\r\nIn dismissing the villein who had brought her, he gave him a piece of\r\nadvice quite in keeping with the wisdom of the time concerning the\r\nchastising of daughters: \"Take her back to her father and box her ears\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nSire Robert held such discipline to be excellent, for more than once\r\nhe urged Uncle Lassois to take Jeanne home well whipped.[345]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 444. L. Mougenot, _Jeanne d'Arc,\r\nle Duc de Lorraine et le Sire de Baudricourt_, Nancy, 1895, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nAfter a week's absence she returned to the village. Neither the\r\nCaptain's contumely nor the garrison's insults had humiliated or\r\ndiscouraged her. Imagining that her Voices had foretold them,[346] she\r\nheld them to be proofs of the truth of her mission. Like those who\r\nwalk in their sleep she was calm in the face of obstacles and yet\r\nquietly persistent. In the house, in the garden, in the meadow, she\r\ncontinued to sleep that marvellous slumber, in which she dreamed of\r\nthe Dauphin, of his knights, and of battles with angels hovering\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nShe found it impossible to be silent; on all occasions her secret\r\nescaped from her. She was always prophesying, but she was never\r\nbelieved. On St. John the Baptist's Eve, about a month after her\r\nreturn, she said sententiously to Michel Lebuin, a husbandman of\r\nBurey, who was quite a boy: \"Between Coussey and Vaucouleurs is a girl\r\nwho in less than a year from now will cause the Dauphin to be anointed\r\nKing of France.\"[347]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: _Ibid._, p. 440.]\r\n\r\nOne day meeting Gerardin d'Epinal, the only man at Domremy not of the\r\nDauphin's party, whose head according to her own confession she would\r\nwillingly have cut off, although she was godmother to his son, she\r\ncould not refrain from announcing even to him in veiled words her\r\nmystic dealing with God: \"Gossip, if you were not a Burgundian there\r\nis something I would tell you.\"[348]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: _Ibid._, p. 423.]\r\n\r\nThe good man thought it must be a question of an approaching betrothal\r\nand that Jacques d'Arc's daughter was about to marry one of the lads\r\nwith whom she had broken bread under _l'Arbre des Fees_ and drunk\r\nwater from the Gooseberry Spring.\r\n\r\nAlas! how greatly would Jacques d'Arc have desired the secret to be of\r\nthat nature. This upright man was very strict; he was careful\r\nconcerning his children's conduct; and Jeanne's behaviour caused him\r\nanxiety. He knew not that she heard Voices. He had no idea that all\r\nday Paradise came down into his garden, that from Heaven to his house\r\na ladder was let down, on which there came and went without ceasing\r\nmore angels than had ever trodden the ladder of the Patriarch Jacob;\r\nneither did he imagine that for Jeannette alone, without any one else\r\nperceiving it, a mystery was being played, a thousand times richer and\r\nfiner than those which on feast days were acted on platforms, in towns\r\nlike Toul and Nancy. He was miles away from suspecting such incredible\r\nmarvels. But what he did see was that his daughter was losing her\r\nsenses, that her mind was wandering, and that she was giving utterance\r\nto wild words. He perceived that she could think of nothing but\r\ncavalcades and battles. He must have known something of the escapade\r\nat Vaucouleurs. He was terribly afraid that one day the unhappy child\r\nwould go off for good on her wanderings. This agonising anxiety\r\nhaunted him even in his sleep. One night he dreamed that he saw her\r\nfleeing with men-at-arms; and this dream was so vivid that he\r\nremembered it when he awoke. For several days he said over and over\r\nagain to his sons, Jean and Pierre: \"If I really believed that what I\r\ndreamed of my daughter would ever come true, I would rather see her\r\ndrowned by you; and if you would not do it I would drown her\r\nmyself.\"[349]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 131, 132, 219.]\r\n\r\nIsabelle repeated these words to her daughter hoping that they might\r\nalarm her and cause her to correct her ways. Devout as she was,\r\nJeanne's mother shared her father's fears. The idea that their\r\ndaughter was in danger of becoming a worthless creature was a cruel\r\nthought to these good people. In those troubled times there was a\r\nwhole multitude of these wild women whom the men-at-arms carried with\r\nthem on horseback. Each soldier had his own.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for saints in their youth by the strangeness of\r\ntheir behaviour to give rise to such suspicions. And Jeanne displayed\r\nthose signs of sainthood. She was the talk of the village. Folk\r\npointed at her mockingly, saying: \"There goes she who is to restore\r\nFrance and the royal house.\"[350]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 421, cf. p. 433, \"_et alii juvenes\r\nde ea deridebant_,\" said Colin's son, referring to her piety.]\r\n\r\nThe neighbours had no difficulty in finding a cause for the\r\nstrangeness which possessed the damsel. They attributed it to some\r\nmagic spell. She had been seen beneath the _Beau Mai_ bewreathing it\r\nwith garlands. The old beech was known to be haunted as well as the\r\nspring near by. It was well known, too, that the fairies cast spells.\r\nThere were those who discovered that Jeanne had met a wicked fairy\r\nthere. \"Jeannette has met her fate beneath _l'Arbre des Fees_,\"[351]\r\nthey said. Would that none but peasants had believed that story!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June, from the Duke of Bedford, Regent of France for\r\nHenry VI, Antoine de Vergy, Governor of Champagne, received a\r\ncommission to furnish forth a thousand men-at-arms for the purpose of\r\nbringing the castellany of Vaucouleurs into subjection to the English.\r\nThree weeks later, commanded by the two Vergy, Antoine and Jean, the\r\nlittle company set forth. It consisted of four knights-banneret,\r\nfourteen knights-bachelor, and three hundred and sixty-three\r\nmen-at-arms. Pierre de Trie, commander of Beauvais, Jean, Count of\r\nNeufchatel and Fribourg, were ordered to join the main body.[352]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: Report of Andre d'Epernon in S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a\r\nDomremy_, p. clxvii and proofs and illustrations, pp. 217, 218, 220.]\r\n\r\nOn the march, as was his custom, Antoine de Vergy laid waste all the\r\nvillages of the castellany with fire and sword. Threatened once again\r\nwith a disaster with which they were only too well acquainted, the\r\nfolk of Domremy and Greux already beheld their cattle captured, their\r\nbarns set on fire, their wives and daughters ravished. Having\r\nexperienced before that the Castle on the Island was not secure\r\nenough, they determined to flee and seek refuge in their market town\r\nof Neufchateau, only five miles away from Domremy. Thus they set out\r\ntowards the middle of July. Abandoning their houses and fields and\r\ndriving their cattle before them, they followed the road, through the\r\nfields of wheat and rye and up the vine-clad hills to the town,\r\nwherein they lodged as best they could.[353]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 51, 214; vol. ii, pp. 391-454. S.\r\nLuce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. clxxvi.]\r\n\r\nThe d'Arc family was taken in by the wife of Jean Waldaires, who was\r\ncalled La Rousse. She kept an inn, where lodged soldiers, monks,\r\nmerchants, and pilgrims. There were some who suspected her of\r\nharbouring bad women.[354] And there is reason to believe that certain\r\nof her women customers were of doubtful reputation. Albeit she herself\r\nwas of good standing, that is to say, she was rich. She had money\r\nenough to lend sometimes to her fellow-citizens.[355] Although\r\nNeufchateau belonged to the Duke of Lorraine, who was of the\r\nBurgundian party, it has been thought that the hostess of this inn\r\ninclined towards the Armagnacs; but it is vain to attempt to discover\r\nthe sentiments of La Rousse concerning the troubles of the kingdom of\r\nFrance.[356]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. clxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 51, 214; vol. ii, p. 402.]\r\n\r\nAt Neufchateau as at Domremy Jeanne drove her father's beasts to the\r\nfield and kept his flocks.[357] Handy and robust she used also to help\r\nLa Rousse in her household duties.[358] This circumstance gave rise to\r\nthe malicious report set on foot by the Burgundians that she had been\r\nserving maid in an inn frequented by drunkards and bad women.[359] The\r\ntruth is that Jeanne, when she was not tending the cattle, and helping\r\nher hostess, passed all her time in church.[360]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 409, 423, 428, 463.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: _Ibid._, pp. 416, 417.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: Monstrelet, vol. iii, p. 314.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nThere were two fine religious houses in the town, one belonging to the\r\nGrey Friars, the other to the Sisters of St. Claire, the sons and\r\ndaughters of good St. Francis.[361] The monastery of the Grey Friars\r\nhad been built two hundred years earlier by Mathieu II of Lorraine.\r\nThe reigning duke had recently added richly to its endowments. Noble\r\nladies, great lords, and among others a Bourlemont lord of Domremy and\r\nGreux lay there beneath brasses.[362]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. clxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: Expilly, _Dictionnaire geographique de la France_,\r\nunder the word _Neufchateau_.]\r\n\r\nIn the flower of their history these mendicant monks of old had\r\nwelcomed to their third order crowds of citizens and peasants as well\r\nas multitudes of princes and kings.[363] Now they languished corrupt\r\nand decadent among the French friars. Quarrels and schisms were\r\nfrequent. Notwithstanding Colette of Corbie's attempted restoration of\r\nthe rule, the old discipline was nowhere observed.[364] These\r\nmendicants distributed leaden medals, taught short prayers to serve as\r\ncharms, and vowed special devotion to the holy name of Jesus.[365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: S.M. de Vernon, _Histoire generale et particuliere du\r\ntiers-ordre de Saint-Francois_, Paris, 1667, 3 vols. in 8vo. Hilarion\r\nde Nolay, _Histoire du tiers-ordre_, Lyon, 1694, in 4to.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: Acta Sanctorum, March, vol. i, p. 549.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Wadding, _Annales Minorum_, vol. v, p. 183.]\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight Jeanne spent in the town of Neufchateau,[366] she\r\nfrequented the church of the Grey Friars monastery, and two or three\r\ntimes confessed to brethren of the order.[367] It has been stated that\r\nshe belonged to the third order of St. Francis, and the inference has\r\nbeen drawn that her affiliation dated from her stay at Neufchateau.[368]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: Jean Morel declares that she was at Neufchateau four\r\ndays, and he adds: \"What I tell you I know, for I was with the others\r\nat Neufchateau\" (_Trial_, vol. ii, p. 392); Gerard Guillemette speaks\r\nof four or five days (_Ibid._, p. 414); Nicolas Bailly of three or\r\nfour (_Ibid._, p. 451). But Jeanne told her judges at Rouen that she\r\nstayed a fortnight at Neufchateau (_Ibid._, vol. i, p. 51). When she\r\ngave her evidence, the event was less remote, and doubtless her\r\nrecollection of it was more accurate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, chs. ix, x, xi. Abbe\r\nV. Mourot, _Jeanne d'Arc et le tiers-ordre de Saint-Francois_,\r\nSaint-Die, 1886, in 8vo. L. de Kerval, _Jeanne d'Arc et les\r\nFranciscains_, Vanves, 1893, in 18mo. _E iera begina_, says a\r\ncorrespondent of Morosini, edited by Lefevre-Pontalis, vol. iii, p. 92\r\nand note 2.]\r\n\r\nSuch an inference is very doubtful; and in any case the affiliation\r\ncannot have been very ceremonious. It is difficult to see how in so\r\nshort a time the friars could have instructed her in the practices of\r\nFranciscan piety. She was far too imbued with ecclesiastical notions\r\nconcerning the spiritual and the temporal power, she was too full of\r\nmysteries and revelations to imbibe their spirit. Besides, her sojourn\r\nat Neufchateau was troubled by anxiety and broken by absences.\r\n\r\nIn this town she received a summons to appear before the official of\r\nToul, in whose jurisdiction she was, as a native of Domremy-de-Greux.\r\nA young bachelor of Domremy alleged that a promise of marriage had\r\nbeen given him by Jacques d'Arc's daughter. Jeanne denied it. He\r\npersisted in his statement, and summoned her to appear before the\r\nofficial.[369] To this ecclesiastical tribunal such cases belonged; it\r\npronounced judgment on questions of nullity of marriage or validity of\r\nbetrothal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 128, 219. E. Misset, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\nChampenoise_, 1895, in 8vo, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe curious part of Jeanne's case is that her parents were against\r\nher, and on the side of the young man. It was in defiance of their\r\nwishes that she defended the suit and appeared before the official.\r\nLater she declared that in this matter she had disobeyed them, and\r\nthat it was the only time she had failed in the submission she owed\r\nher parents.[370]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 219: _quibus obediebat in omnibus,\r\nnisi in processu Tullensi_.]\r\n\r\nThe journey from Neufchateau to Toul and back involved travelling more\r\nthan twenty leagues on foot, over roads infested with bands of armed\r\nmen, through a country desolated by fire and sword, from which the\r\npeasants of Domremy had recently fled in a panic. To such a journey,\r\nhowever, she made up her mind against the will of her parents.\r\n\r\nPossibly she may have appeared before the judge at Toul, not once but\r\ntwo or three times. And there was a great chance of her having to\r\njourney day and night with her so-called betrothed, for he was passing\r\nover the same road at the same time. Her Voices bade her fear nothing.\r\nBefore the judge she swore to speak the truth, and denied having made\r\nany promise of marriage.\r\n\r\nShe had done nothing wrong. But an evil interpretation was set upon\r\nconduct which proceeded alone from an innocence both singular and\r\nheroic. At Neufchateau it was said that on those journeys she had\r\nconsumed all her substance. But what was her substance? Alas! she had\r\nset out with nothing. She may have been driven to beg her bread from\r\ndoor to door. Saints receive alms as they give them: for the love of\r\nGod. There was a story that her betrothed seeing her living during the\r\ntrial in company with bad women, had abandoned his demand for justice,\r\nrenouncing a bride of such bad repute.[371] Such calumnies were only\r\ntoo readily believed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 215. Article 9 of the deed of\r\naccusation is drawn up as the result of an inquiry made at\r\nNeufchateau.]\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight's sojourn at Neufchateau, Jacques d'Arc and his\r\nfamily returned to Domremy. The orchard, the house, the monastery, the\r\nvillage, the fields,--in what a state of desolation did they behold\r\nthem! The soldiers had plundered, ravaged, burnt everything. Unable to\r\nexact ransom from the villeins who had taken flight, the men-at-arms\r\nhad destroyed all their goods. The monastery once as proud as a\r\nfortress, with its watchman's tower, was now nothing but a heap of\r\nblackened ruins. And now on holy days the folk of Domremy must needs\r\ngo to hear mass in the church of Greux.[372]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 396, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nSo full of danger were the times that the villagers were ordered to\r\nkeep in fortified houses and castles.[373]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. clxxx, 230.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the English were laying siege to the town of Orleans, which\r\nbelonged to their prisoner Duke Charles. By so doing they acted badly,\r\nfor, having possession of his body, they ought to have respected his\r\nproperty.[374] They built fortified towers round the city of Orleans,\r\nthe very heart of France; and it was said that they had entrenched\r\nthemselves there in great strength.[375] Now Saint Catherine and Saint\r\nMargaret loved the Land of the Lilies; they were the sworn friends and\r\ngentle cousins of the Dauphin Charles. They talked to the shepherd\r\nmaid of the misfortunes of the kingdom and continued to say: \"Leave\r\nthy village and go into France.\"[376]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _Mistere du siege_, v, 497.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, chs. xxxiv, xxxv. Jean\r\nChartier, _Chronique_, chs. xxxii, xxxv; _Journal du siege_, pp. 2 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 52, 216.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was all the more impatient to set forth because she had herself\r\nannounced the time of her arrival in France, and that time was drawing\r\nnear. She had told the Commander of Vaucouleurs that succour should\r\ncome to the Dauphin before mid Lent. She did not want to make her\r\nVoices lie.[377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 456.]\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of January occurred the opportunity she was looking\r\nfor of returning to Burey. At this time Durand Lassois' wife, Jeanne\r\nle Vauseul, was brought to bed.[378] It was the custom in the country\r\nfor the young kinswomen and friends of the mother to attend and wait\r\nupon her and her babe. A good and kindly custom, followed all the more\r\nreadily because of the opportunity it gave of pleasant meetings and\r\ncheerful gossip.[379] Jeanne urged her uncle to ask her father that\r\nshe might be sent to tend the sick woman, and Lassois consented: he\r\nwas always ready to do what his niece asked him, and perhaps his\r\ncomplaisance was encouraged by pious persons of some importance.[380]\r\nBut how this father, who shortly before had said that he would throw\r\nhis daughter into the Meuse rather than that she should go off with\r\nmen-at-arms, should have allowed her to go to the gates of the town,\r\nprotected by a kinsman of whose weakness he was well aware, is hard to\r\nunderstand. However so he did.[381]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 428, 434. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\na Domremy_, p. clxxx.

As she went by the house of the husbandman\r\nGerard Guillemette of Greux, whose children and Jacques d'Arc's were\r\ngreat friends, she cried: \"Good-bye! I am going to Vaucouleurs.\"[382]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: _Ibid._, p. 416.]\r\n\r\nA few paces further she saw her friend Mengette: \"Good-bye, Mengette,\"\r\nshe said. \"God bless thee.\"[383]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: _Ibid._, p. 431.]\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, on the doorsteps of the houses, whenever she saw faces\r\nshe knew, she bade them farewell.[384] But she avoided Hauviette with\r\nwhom she had played and slept in childhood and whom she dearly loved.\r\nIf she were to bid her good-bye she feared that her heart would fail\r\nher. It was not till later that Hauviette heard of her friend's\r\ndeparture and then she wept bitterly.[385]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 418.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: _Ibid._, p. 419: _dixit quod nescivit recessum dictae\r\nJohannae; quae testis propter hoc multum flebat, quia eam multum propter\r\nsuam bonitatem diligebat et quod sua socia erat_.]\r\n\r\nOn her second arrival at Vaucouleurs, Jeanne imagined that she was\r\nsetting foot in a town belonging to the Dauphin, and, in the language\r\nof the day, entering the royal antechamber.[386] She was mistaken.\r\nSince the beginning of August, 1428, the Commander of Vaucouleurs had\r\nyielded the fortress to Antoine de Vergy, but had not yet surrendered\r\nit to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 436.]\r\n\r\nIt was one of those promises to capitulate at the end of a given time.\r\nThey were not uncommon in those days, and they ceased to be valid if\r\nthe fortress were relieved before the day fixed for its\r\nsurrender.[387]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. clxviii, 222,\r\n234.]\r\n\r\nJeanne went to Sire Robert in his castle just as she had done nine\r\nmonths before; and this was the revelation she made to him: \"My Lord\r\nCaptain,\" she said, \"know that God has again given me to wit, and\r\ncommanded me many times to go to the gentle Dauphin, who must be and\r\nwho is the true King of France, and that he shall grant me men-at-arms\r\nwith whom I shall raise the siege of Orleans and take him to his\r\nanointing at Reims.\"[388]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 273; _La Chronique de\r\nLorraine_ in Dom Calmet, _Histoire de Lorraine_, vol. iii, col. vj,\r\ngives an amplified version of these words, the authenticity of which\r\nis doubtful.]\r\n\r\nThis time she announces that it is her mission to deliver Orleans. And\r\nthe anointing is not to come to pass until this the first part of her\r\ntask shall have been accomplished. We cannot fail to recognise the\r\nreadiness and the tact with which the Voices altered their commands\r\npreviously given, according to the necessities of the moment. Robert's\r\nmanner towards Jeanne had completely changed. He said nothing about\r\nboxing her ears and sending her back to her parents. He no longer\r\ntreated her roughly; and if he did not believe her announcement at\r\nleast he listened to it readily.\r\n\r\nIn one of her conversations with him she spoke of strange matters:\r\n\"Once I have accomplished the behest Messire has given me, I shall\r\nmarry and I shall bear three sons, the eldest of whom shall be pope,\r\nthe second emperor, and the third king.\"\r\n\r\nSire Robert answered gayly: \"Since thy sons are to be such great\r\npersonages, I should like to give thee one. Thereby should I myself\r\nhave honour.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne replied: \"Nay, gentle Robert, nay. It is not yet time. The Holy\r\nGhost shall appoint the time.\"[389]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 219, 220. The source is doubtful.\r\nNevertheless the accusation here lays stress on these facts produced\r\nby the inquiry. If Jeanne denied having spoken these words, it was\r\nbecause she had forgotten them, or because they had been so changed\r\nthat she could disavow the form in which they were presented to her.]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the few of her words handed down to us, in the early\r\ndays of her mission the young prophetess spoke alternately two\r\ndifferent languages. Her speech seemed to flow from two distinct\r\nsources. The one ingenuous, candid, naive, concise, rustically simple,\r\nunconsciously arch, sometimes rough, alike chivalrous and holy,\r\ngenerally bearing on the inheritance and the anointing of the Dauphin\r\nand the confounding of the English. This was the language of her\r\nVoices, her own, her soul's language. The other, more subtle,\r\nflavoured with allegory and flowers of speech, critical with\r\nscholastic grace, bearing on the Church, suggesting the clerk and\r\nbetraying some outside influence. The words she uttered to Sire Robert\r\ntouching the children she should bear are of the second sort. They are\r\nan allegory. Her triple birth signifies that the peace of Christendom\r\nshall be born of her work, that after she shall have fulfilled her\r\ndivine mission, the Pope, the Emperor, and the King--all three sons of\r\nGod--shall cause concord and love to reign in the Church of Jesus\r\nChrist. The apologue is quite clear; and yet a certain amount of\r\nintelligence is necessary for its comprehension. The Captain failed to\r\nunderstand it; he interpreted it literally and answered accordingly,\r\nfor he was a simple fellow and a merry.[390]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: See _ante_, page 66.]\r\n\r\nJeanne lodged in the town with humble folk, Henri Leroyer and his wife\r\nCatherine, friends of her cousin Lassois. She used to occupy her time\r\nin spinning, being a good spinster; and the little she had she gave to\r\nthe poor. With Catherine she went to the parish church.[391] In the\r\nmorning, in her most devout moods, she would climb the hill, round the\r\nfoot of which cluster the roofs of the town, and enter the chapel of\r\nSainte Marie-de-Vaucouleurs. This collegiate church, built in the\r\nreign of Philippe VI, adjoined the _chateau_ wherein dwelt the\r\nCommander of Vaucouleurs. The venerable stone nave rose up boldly\r\ntowards the east, overlooking the vast extent of hills and meadows,\r\nand dominating the valley where Jeanne had been born and bred. She\r\nused to hear mass and remain long in prayer.[392]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 446.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 461.]\r\n\r\nUnder the chapel, in the crypt, there was an image of the Virgin,\r\nancient and deeply venerated, called Notre-Dame-de-la-Voute.[393] It\r\nworked miracles, but especially on behalf of the poor and needy.\r\nJeanne delighted to remain in this dark and lonely crypt, where the\r\nsaints preferred to visit her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. cxcxiv.]\r\n\r\nOne day a young clerk, barely more than a child, who waited in the\r\nchapel, saw the damsel motionless, with hands clasped, head thrown\r\nback, eyes full of tears raised to heaven; and as long as he lived the\r\nvision of that rapture remained imprinted on his mind.[394]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 460, 461 (evidence of Jean le\r\nFumeux in the rehabilitation trial).]\r\n\r\nShe confessed often, usually to Jean Fournier, priest of\r\nVaucouleurs.[395]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: _Ibid._, p. 446.]\r\n\r\nHer hostess was touched by the goodness and gentleness of her manner\r\nof life; but she was profoundly agitated when one day the damsel said\r\nto her: \"Dost thou not know it hath been prophesied that France ruined\r\nby a woman shall be saved by a maiden from the Lorraine Marches?\"\r\n\r\nLeroyer's wife knew as well as Durand Lassois that Madame Ysabeau, as\r\nfull of wickedness as Herodias, had delivered up Madame Catherine of\r\nFrance and the Kingdom of the Lilies to the King of England. And\r\nhenceforth she was almost persuaded to believe that Jeanne was the\r\nmaid announced by the prophecy.[396]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: _Ibid._, p. 447.]\r\n\r\nThis pious damsel held converse with devout persons and also with men\r\nof noble rank. To all alike she said: \"I must to the gentle Dauphin.\r\nIt is the will of Messire, the King of Heaven, that I wend to the\r\ngentle Dauphin. I am sent by the King of Heaven. I must go even if I\r\ngo on my knees.\"[397]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 448.]\r\n\r\nRevelations of this nature she made to Messire Aubert, Lord of\r\nOurches. He was a good Frenchman and of the Armagnac party, since four\r\nyears earlier he had made war against the English and Burgundians. She\r\ntold him that she must go to the Dauphin, that she demanded to be\r\ntaken to him, and that to him should redound profit and honour\r\nincomparable.\r\n\r\nAt length through her illuminations and her prophecies, her fame was\r\nspread abroad in the town; and her words were found to be good.[398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: _Quae puella multum bene loquebatur._ _Trial_, vol. ii,\r\np. 450. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nIn the garrison there was a man-at-arms of about twenty-eight years of\r\nage, Jean de Novelompont or Nouillompont, who was commonly called Jean\r\nde Metz. By rank a freeman, albeit not of noble estate, he had\r\nacquired or inherited the lordship of Nouillompont and Hovecourt,\r\nsituate in that part of Barrois which was outside the Duke's domain;\r\nand he bore its name.[399] Formerly in the pay of Jean de Wals,\r\nCaptain and Provost of Stenay, he was now, in 1428, in the service of\r\nthe Commander of Vaucouleurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 363; _Journal du siege_, p. 45. S.\r\nLuce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. xcv, cxi, cxxvj. De Beaucourt,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p. 204, note. E. de Bouteiller and\r\nG. de Braux, _Nouvelles recherches_, pp. xxv _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOf his morals and manner of life we know nothing, except that three\r\nyears before he had sworn a vile oath and been condemned to pay a fine\r\nof two _sols_.[400] Apparently when he took the oath he was in great\r\nwrath.[401] He was more or less intimate with Bertrand de Poulengy,\r\nwho had certainly spoken to him of Jeanne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: _A sol tournois_ is the twentieth part of a _livre\r\ntournois_ (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. cxc, 160, 161.]\r\n\r\nOne day he met the damsel and said to her: \"Well, _ma mie_, what are\r\nyou doing here? Must the King be driven from his kingdom and we all\r\nturn English?\"[402]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 435-457. E. de Bouteiller and G.\r\nde Braux, _Nouvelles recherches_, pp. xxvi, xxvii.]\r\n\r\nSuch words from a young Lorraine warrior are worthy of notice. The\r\nTreaty of Troyes did not subject France to England; it united the two\r\nkingdoms. If war continued after as before, it was merely to decide\r\nbetween the two claimants, Charles de Valois and Henry of Lancaster.\r\nWhoever gained the victory, nothing would be changed in the laws and\r\ncustoms of France. Yet this poor freebooter of the German Marches\r\nimagined none the less that under an English king he would be an\r\nEnglishman. Many French of all ranks believed the same and could not\r\nsuffer the thought of being Anglicised; in their minds their own fates\r\ndepended on the fate of the kingdom and of the Dauphin Charles.\r\n\r\nJeanne answered Jean de Metz: \"I came hither to the King's territory\r\nto speak with Sire Robert, that he may take me or command me to be\r\ntaken to the Dauphin; but he heeds neither me nor my words.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with the fixed idea welling up in her heart that her mission\r\nmust be begun before the middle of Lent: \"Notwithstanding, ere mid\r\nLent, I must be before the Dauphin, were I in going to wear my legs to\r\nthe knees.\"[403]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 436. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de\r\nCharles VII_, vol. ii, pp. 396 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nA report ran through the towns and villages. It was said that the son\r\nof the King of France, the Dauphin Louis, who had just entered his\r\nfifth year, had been recently betrothed to the daughter of the King of\r\nScotland, the three-year-old Madame Margaret, and the common people\r\ncelebrated this royal union with such rejoicings as were possible in a\r\ndesolated country.[404] Jeanne, when she heard these tidings, said to\r\nthe man-at-arms: \"I must go to the Dauphin, for no one in the world,\r\nno king or duke or daughter of the King of Scotland, can restore the\r\nrealm of France.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 436. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a\r\nDomremy_, p. cxci.]\r\n\r\nThen straightway she added: \"In me alone is help, albeit for my part,\r\nI would far rather be spinning by my poor mother's side, for this life\r\nis not to my liking. But I must go; and so I will, for it is Messire's\r\ncommand that I should go.\"\r\n\r\nShe said what she thought. But she did not know herself; she did not\r\nknow that her Voices were the cries of her own heart, and that she\r\nlonged to quit the distaff for the sword.\r\n\r\nJean de Metz asked, as Sire Robert had done: \"Who is Messire?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is God,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThen straightway, as if he believed in her, he said with a sudden\r\nimpulse: \"I promise you, and I give you my word of honour, that God\r\nhelping me I will take you to the King.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her his hand as a sign that he pledged his word and asked:\r\n\"When will you set forth?\"\r\n\r\n\"This hour,\" she answered, \"is better than to-morrow; to-morrow is\r\nbetter than after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nJean de Metz himself, twenty-seven years later, reported this\r\nconversation.[405] If we are to believe him, he asked the damsel in\r\nconclusion whether she would travel in her woman's garb. It is easy to\r\nimagine what difficulties he would foresee in journeying with a\r\npeasant girl clad in a red frock over French roads infested with\r\nlecherous fellows, and that he would deem it wiser for her to disguise\r\nherself as a boy. She promptly divined his thought and replied: \"I\r\nwill willingly dress as a man.\"[406]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 436.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: _Ibid._, p. 436, 437.]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why these things should not have occurred. Only if\r\nthey did, then a Lorraine freebooter suggested to the saint that idea\r\nconcerning her dress which later she will think to have received from\r\nGod.[407]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 161, 176, 332. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 45. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 372.]\r\n\r\nOf his own accord, or rather, acting by the advice of some wise\r\nperson, Sire Robert desired to know whether Jeanne was not being\r\ninspired by an evil spirit. For the devil is cunning and sometimes\r\nassumes the mark of innocence. And as Sire Robert was not learned in\r\nsuch matters, he determined to take counsel with his priest.\r\n\r\nNow one day when Catherine and Jeanne were at home spinning, they\r\nbeheld the Commander coming accompanied by the priest, Messire Jean\r\nFournier. They asked the mistress of the house to withdraw; and when\r\nthey were left alone with the damsel, Messire Jean Fournier put on\r\nhis stole and pronounced some Latin words which amounted to saying:\r\n\"If thou be evil, away with thee; if thou be good, draw nigh.\"[408]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 446.]\r\n\r\nIt was the ordinary formula of exorcism or, to be more exact, of\r\nconjuration. In the opinion of Messire Jean Fournier these words,\r\naccompanied by a few drops of holy water, would drive away devils, if\r\nthere should unhappily be any in the body of this village maiden.\r\n\r\nMessire Jean Fournier was convinced that devils were possessed by an\r\nuncontrollable desire to enter the bodies of men, and especially of\r\nmaidens, who sometimes swallowed them with their bread. They dwelt in\r\nthe mouth under the tongue, in the nostrils, or penetrated down the\r\nthroat into the stomach. In these various abodes their action was\r\nviolent; and their presence was discerned by the contortions and\r\nhowlings of the miserable victims who were possessed.\r\n\r\nPope St. Gregory, in his Dialogues, gives a striking example of the\r\nfacility with which devils insinuate themselves into women. He tells\r\nhow a nun, being in the garden, saw a lettuce which she thought looked\r\ntender. She plucked it, and, neglecting to bless it by making the sign\r\nof the cross, she ate of it and straightway fell possessed. A man of\r\nGod having drawn near unto her, the demon began to cry out: \"It is I!\r\nIt is I who have done it! I was seated upon that lettuce. This woman\r\ncame and she swallowed me.\" But the prayers of the man of God drove\r\nhim out.[409]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: Voragine, _La legende doree_, in the Festival of the\r\nExaltation of the Holy Cross.]\r\n\r\nThe caution required in such a matter was therefore not exaggerated by\r\nMessire Jean Fournier. Possessed by the idea that the devil is subtle\r\nand woman corrupt, carefully and according to prescribed rules he\r\nproceeded to solve a difficult problem. It was generally no easy\r\nmatter to recognise one possessed by the devil and to distinguish\r\nbetween a demoniac and a good Christian. Very great saints had not\r\nbeen spared the trial to which Jeanne was to be subjected.\r\n\r\nHaving recited the formula and sprinkled the holy water, Messire Jean\r\nFournier expected, if the damsel were possessed, to see her struggle,\r\nwrithe, and endeavour to take flight. In such a case he must needs\r\nhave made use of more powerful formulae, have sprinkled more holy\r\nwater, and made more signs of the cross, and by such means have driven\r\nout the devils until they were seen to depart with a terrible noise\r\nand a noxious odour, in the shape of dragons, camels, or fish.[410]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Migne, _Dictionnaire des sciences occultes_, Paris, 2\r\nvols. in large 8vo, under the word _Exorcisme_.]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing suspicious in Jeanne's attitude. No wild agitation,\r\nno frenzy. Merely anxious and intreating, she dragged herself on her\r\nknees towards the priest. She did not flee before God's holy name.\r\nMessire Jean Fournier concluded that no devil was within her.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in the house with Catherine, Jeanne, who now understood the\r\nmeaning of the ceremony, showed strong resentment towards Messire Jean\r\nFournier. She reproached him with having suspected her: \"It was wrong\r\nof him,\" she said to her hostess, \"for, having heard my confession, he\r\nought to have known me.\"[411]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 446.]\r\n\r\nShe would have thanked the priest of Vaucouleurs had she known how he\r\nwas furthering the fulfilment of her mission by subjecting her to this\r\nordeal. Convinced that this maiden was not inspired by the devil, Sire\r\nRobert must have been driven to conclude that she might be inspired by\r\nGod; for apparently he was a man of simple reasoning. He wrote to the\r\nDauphin Charles concerning the young saint; and doubtless he bore\r\nwitness to the innocence and goodness he beheld in her.[412]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 115. _Journal du siege_, p. 48.\r\n_Mirouer des femmes vertueuses_ in the _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 267.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it looked as if the Captain would have to resign his command\r\nto my Lord de Vergy, Sire Robert did not intend to quit his country\r\nwhere he had dealings with all parties. Indeed he cared little enough\r\nabout the Dauphin Charles, and it is difficult to see what personal\r\ninterest he can have had in recommending him a prophetess. Without\r\npretending to discover what was passing in his mind, one may believe\r\nthat he wrote to the Dauphin on Jeanne's behalf at the request of some\r\nof those persons who thought well of her, probably of Bertrand de\r\nPoulengy and of Jean de Metz. These two men-at-arms, seeing that the\r\nDauphin's cause was lost in the Lorraine Marches, had every reason for\r\nproceeding to the banks of the Loire, where they might still fight\r\nwith the hope of advantage.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of setting out, they appeared disposed to take the seeress\r\nwith them, and even to defray all her expenses, reckoning on repaying\r\nthemselves from the royal coffers at Chinon, and deriving honour and\r\nadvantage from so rare a marvel. But they waited to be assured of the\r\nDauphin's consent.[413]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: Extract from the eighth report of Guillaume Charrier,\r\nin the _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 257 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jeanne could not rest. She came and went from Vaucouleurs to\r\nBurey and from Burey to Vaucouleurs. She counted the days; time\r\ndragged for her as for a woman with child.[414]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 447.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, feeling she could wait no longer, she resolved\r\nto go to the Dauphin Charles alone. She clad herself in garments\r\nbelonging to Durand Lassois, and with this kind cousin set forth on\r\nthe road to France.[415] A man of Vaucouleurs, one Jacques Alain,\r\naccompanied them.[416] Probably these two men expected that the damsel\r\nwould herself realise the impossibility of such a journey and that\r\nthey would not go very far. That is what happened. The three\r\ntravellers had barely journeyed a league from Vaucouleurs, when, near\r\nthe Chapel of Saint Nicholas, which rises in the valley of Septfonds,\r\nin the middle of the great wood of Saulcy, Jeanne changed her mind and\r\nsaid to her comrades that it was not right of her to set out thus.\r\nThen they all three returned to the town.[417]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 53; vol. ii, pp. 443 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 445-447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: _Ibid._, pp. 447-457.]\r\n\r\nAt length a royal messenger brought King Charles's reply to the\r\nCommander of Vaucouleurs. The messenger was called Colet de\r\nVienne.[418] His name indicates that he came from the province which\r\nthe Dauphin had governed before the death of the late King, and which\r\nhad remained unswervingly faithful to the unfortunate prince. The\r\nreply was that Sire Robert should send the young saint to\r\nChinon.[419]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: _Ibid._, p. 406. S.

Anonymous poem on\r\nthe arrival of the Maid, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p. 30.]\r\n\r\nThat which Jeanne had demanded and which it had seemed impossible to\r\nobtain was granted. She was to be taken to the King as she had desired\r\nand within the time fixed by herself. But this departure, for which\r\nshe had so ardently longed, was delayed several days by a remarkable\r\nincident. The incident shows that the fame of the young prophetess had\r\ngone out through Lorraine; and it proves that in those days the great\r\nof the land had recourse to saints in their hour of need.\r\n\r\nJeanne was summoned to Nancy by my Lord the Duke of Lorraine.\r\nFurnished with a safe-conduct that the Duke had sent her, she set\r\nforth in rustic jerkin and hose on a nag given her by Durand Lassois\r\nand Jacques Alain. It had cost them twelve francs which Sire Robert\r\nrepaid them later out of the royal revenue.[420] From Vaucouleurs to\r\nNancy is twenty-four leagues. Jean de Metz accompanied her as far as\r\nToul; Durand Lassois went with her the whole way.[421]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: Durand Lassois says it cost twelve francs, Jean de\r\nMetz, sixteen. \"_Ce serait aujourd'hui un cheval de cent ecus._\" It\r\nwould be a horse worth one hundred crowns to-day (L.

Rene of Anjou,\r\nnow in his twentieth year, was a man of culture as much in love with\r\nsound learning as with chivalry, and withal kind, affable, and\r\ngracious. When not engaged in some military expedition and in wielding\r\nthe lance he delighted to illuminate manuscripts. He had a taste for\r\nflower-decked gardens and stories in tapestry; and like his fair\r\ncousin the Duke of Orleans he wrote poems in French.[424] Invested\r\nwith the duchy of Bar by the Cardinal Duke of Bar, his great-uncle,\r\nhe would inherit the duchy of Lorraine after the death of Duke Charles\r\nwhich could not be far off. This marriage was rightly regarded as a\r\nclever stroke on the part of Madame Yolande. But he who reigns must\r\nfight. The Duke of Burgundy, ill content to see a prince of the house\r\nof Anjou, the brother-in-law of Charles of Valois, established between\r\nBurgundy and Flanders, stirred up against Rene the Count of Vaudemont,\r\nwho was a claimant of the inheritance of Lorraine. The Angevin policy\r\nrendered a reconciliation between the Duke of Burgundy and the King of\r\nFrance difficult. Thus was Rene of Anjou involved in the quarrels of\r\nhis father-in-law of Lorraine. It befell that in this year, 1429, he\r\nwas waging war against the citizens of Metz, the War of the Basketful\r\nof Apples.[425] It was so called because the cause of war was a\r\nbasketful of apples which had been brought into the town of Metz\r\nwithout paying duty to the officers of the Duke of Lorraine.[426]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: Le Pere Anselme, _Histoire genealogique de la maison de\r\nFrance_, vol. ii, p. 218.

Rene, Duke of Bar, had\r\ntherefore ties of kindred, friendship, and interest binding him at the\r\nsame time to the English and Burgundian party as well as to the party\r\nof France. Such was the situation of most of the French nobles. Rene's\r\ncommunications with the Commander of Vaucouleurs were friendly and\r\nconstant.[428] It is possible that Sire Robert may have told him that\r\nhe had a damsel at Vaucouleurs who was prophesying concerning the\r\nrealm of France. It is possible that the Duke of Bar, curious to see\r\nher, may have had her sent to Nancy, where he was to be towards the\r\n20th of February. But it is much more likely that Rene of Anjou\r\nthought less about the Maid of Vaucouleurs, whom he had never seen,\r\nthan about the little Moor and the jester who enlivened the ducal\r\npalace.[429] In this month of February, 1429, he was neither desirous\r\nnor able to concern himself greatly with the affairs of France; and\r\nalthough brother-in-law to King Charles, he was preparing not to\r\nsuccour the town of Orleans, but to besiege the town of Metz.[430]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: S.

Dom Calmet, _Histoire de Lorraine_,\r\nvol. ii, proofs and illustrations, col. cxcix.]\r\n\r\nOld and ill, Duke Charles dwelt in his palace with his paramour Alison\r\ndu Mai, a bastard and a priest's daughter, who had driven out the\r\nlawful wife, Dame Marguerite of Bavaria. Dame Marguerite was pious and\r\nhigh-born, but old and ugly, while Madame Alison was pretty. She had\r\nborne Duke Charles several children.[431]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. cc, note.]\r\n\r\nThe following story appears the most authentic. There were certain\r\nworthy persons at Nancy who wanted Duke Charles to take back his good\r\nwife. To persuade him to do so they had recourse to the exhortations\r\nof a saint, who had revelations from Heaven, and who called herself\r\nthe Daughter of God. By these persons the damsel of Domremy was\r\nrepresented to the enfeebled old Duke as being a saint who worked\r\nmiracles of healing. By their advice he had her summoned in the hope\r\nthat she possessed secrets which should alleviate his sufferings and\r\nkeep him alive.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw her he asked whether she could not restore him to\r\nhis former health and strength.\r\n\r\nShe replied that \"of such things\" she knew nothing. But she warned him\r\nthat his ways were evil, and that he would not be cured until he had\r\namended them. She enjoined upon him to send away Alison, his\r\nconcubine, and to take back his good wife.[432]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 87. Dom Calmet, _Histoire de\r\nLorraine_, vol. iii, proofs and illustrations, col. vj.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt she had been told to say something of this kind; but it also\r\ncame from her own heart, for she loathed bad women.\r\n\r\nJeanne had come to the Duke because it was his due, because a little\r\nsaint must not refuse when a great lord wishes to consult her, and\r\nbecause in short she had been brought to Nancy. But her mind was\r\nelsewhere; of nought could she think but of saving the realm of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nReflecting that Madame Yolande's son with a goodly company of\r\nmen-at-arms would be of great aid to the Dauphin, she asked the Duke\r\nof Lorraine, as she took her leave, to send this young knight with her\r\ninto France.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your son,\" she said, \"with men-at-arms as my escort. In\r\nreturn I will pray to God for your restoration to health.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke did not give her men-at-arms; neither did he give her the\r\nDuke of Bar, the heir of Lorraine, the ally of the English, who was\r\nnevertheless to join her soon beneath the standard of King Charles.\r\nBut he gave her four francs and a black horse.[433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 391, 444.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was on her return from Nancy that she wrote to her parents\r\nasking their pardon for having left them. The fact that they received\r\na letter and forgave is all that is known.[434] One cannot forbear\r\nsurprise that Jacques d'Arc, all through the month that his daughter\r\nwas at Vaucouleurs, should have remained quietly at home, when\r\npreviously, after having merely dreamed of her being with men-at-arms,\r\nhe had threatened that if his sons did not drown her he would with his\r\nown hands. For he must have been aware that at Vaucouleurs she was\r\nliving with men-at-arms. Knowing her temperament, he had displayed\r\ngreat simplicity in letting her go. One cannot help supposing that\r\nthose pious persons who believed in Jeanne's goodness, and desired her\r\nto be taken into France for the saving of the kingdom, must have\r\nundertaken to reassure her father and mother concerning their\r\ndaughter's manner of life; perhaps they even gave the simple folk to\r\nunderstand that if Jeanne did go to the King her family would derive\r\ntherefrom honour and advantage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nBefore or after her journey to Nancy (which is not known), certain of\r\nthe townsfolk of Vaucouleurs who believed in the young prophetess\r\neither had made, or purchased for her ready made, a suit of masculine\r\nclothing, a jerkin, cloth doublet, hose laced on to the coat, gaiters,\r\nspurs, a whole equipment of war. Sire Robert gave her a sword.[435]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 54; vol. ii, pp. 438, 445, 447,\r\n457. _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in the _Revue historique_,\r\nvol. iv, p. 336.]\r\n\r\nShe had her hair cut round like a boy.[436] Jean de Metz and Bertrand\r\nde Poulengy, with their servants Jean de Honecourt and Julien, were to\r\naccompany her as well as the King's messenger, Colet de Vienne, and\r\nthe bowman Richard.[437] There was still some delay and councils were\r\nheld, for the soldiers of Antoine de Lorraine, Lord of Joinville,\r\ninfested the country. Throughout the land there was nothing but\r\npillage, robbery, murder, cruel tyranny, the ravishing of women, the\r\nburning of churches and abbeys, and the perpetration of horrible\r\ncrimes. Those were the hardest times ever known to man.[438] But the\r\ndamsel was not afraid, and said: \"In God's name! take me to the gentle\r\nDauphin, and fear not any trouble or hindrance we may meet.\"[439]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in the _Revue\r\nhistorique_, _ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 406, 432, 442, 457; vol. iii, p.\r\n209.

Bertrand de Poulengy says\r\nthat the journey to Chinon (6th March) lasted eleven days, and that\r\nsometimes they travelled by night only (_ibid._). It is difficult to\r\nadmit that they started from Vaucouleurs on the 23rd of February, and\r\nthat about 660 kilometres were traversed in eleven days.]\r\n\r\nA few friends who had followed her so far watched her go. Among them\r\nwere her hosts, Henri Leroyer and Catherine, and Messire Jean Colin,\r\ncanon of Saint-Nicolas, near Vaucouleurs, to whom Jeanne had confessed\r\nseveral times.[441] They trembled for their saint as they thought of\r\nthe perils of the way and the length of the journey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 431, 446.]\r\n\r\n\"How can you,\" they asked her, \"set forth on such a journey when there\r\nare men-at-arms on every hand?\" But out of the serene peace of her\r\nheart she answered them:\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear men-at-arms; my way has been made plain before me. If\r\nthere be men-at-arms my Lord God will make a way for me to go to my\r\nLord Dauphin. For that am I come.\"[442]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: _Ibid._, p. 449.]\r\n\r\nSire Robert was present at her departure. According to the customary\r\nformula he took an oath from each of the men-at-arms that they would\r\nsurely and safely conduct her whom he confided to them. Then, being a\r\nman of little faith, he said to Jeanne in lieu of farewell: \"Go! and\r\ncome what may.\"[443] And the little company went off into the mist,\r\nwhich at that season envelops the meadows of the Meuse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 55.]\r\n\r\nThey were obliged to avoid frequented roads and to beware especially\r\nof passing by Joinville, Montiers-en-Saulx and Sailly, where there\r\nwere soldiers of the hostile party. Sire Bertrand and Jean de Metz\r\nwere accustomed to such stealthy expeditions; they knew the byways and\r\nwere acquainted with useful precautions, such as binding up the\r\nhorses' feet in linen so as to deaden the sound of hoofs on the\r\nground.[444]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: De Pimodan, _La premiere etape de Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris,\r\n1891, in 8vo, with maps.]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, having escaped all danger, the company approached the\r\nright bank of the Marne and reached the Abbey of Saint-Urbain.[445]\r\nFrom time immemorial it had been a place of refuge, and in those days\r\nits abbot was Arnoult of Aulnoy, a kinsman of Robert of\r\nBaudricourt.[446] The gate of the plain edifice opened for the\r\ntravellers who passed beneath the groined vaulting of its roof.[447]\r\nThe abbey included a building set apart for strangers. There they\r\nfound the resting-place of the first stage of their journey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: Jolibois, _Dictionnaire historique de la Haute-Marne_,\r\np. 492.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: De Pimodan, _La premiere etape de Jeanne d'Arc_, _loc.\r\ncit._]\r\n\r\nOn the right of the outer door was the abbey church wherein were\r\npreserved the relics of Pope Saint Urbain. On the 24th of February, in\r\nthe morning, Jeanne attended conventual mass there.[448] Then she and\r\nher companions took horse again. Crossing the Marne by the bridge\r\nopposite Saint-Urbain, they pressed on towards France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 54, 55.]\r\n\r\nThey had still one hundred and twenty-five leagues to cover and three\r\nrivers to cross, in a country infested with brigands. Through fear of\r\nthe enemy they journeyed by night.[449] When they lay down on the\r\nstraw the damsel, keeping her hose laced to her coat, slept in her\r\nclothes, under a covering, between Jean de Metz and Bertrand de\r\nPoulengy in whom she felt confidence. They said afterwards that they\r\nnever desired the damsel because of the holiness they beheld in\r\nher;[450] that may or may not be believed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 437. According to the somewhat\r\nimprobable testimony of Bertrand de Poulengy. _See ante_, p. 96, note\r\n6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 457.]\r\n\r\nJean de Metz was filled with no such ardent faith in the prophetess,\r\nsince he inquired of her: \"Will you really do what you say?\"\r\n\r\nTo which she replied: \"Have no fear. I do what I am commanded to do.\r\nMy brethren in Paradise tell me what I have to do. It is now four or\r\nfive years since my brethren in Paradise and Messire told me that I\r\nmust go forth to war to deliver the realm of France.\"[451]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: _Ibid._, pp. 437, 438.]\r\n\r\nThese rude comrades did not all preserve an attitude of religious\r\nrespect in her presence. Certain mocked her and diverted themselves by\r\ntalking before her as if they belonged to the English party.\r\nSometimes, as a joke, they got up a false alarm and pretended to turn\r\nback. Their jests were wasted. She believed them, but she was not\r\nafraid, and would say gravely to those who thought to frighten her\r\nwith the English: \"Be sure not to flee. I tell you in God's name, they\r\nwill not harm you.\"[452]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 199.]\r\n\r\nEver at the approach of danger whether real or feigned, there came to\r\nher lips the words of encouragement: \"Do not be afraid. You will see\r\nhow graciously the fair Dauphin will look upon us when we come to\r\nChinon.\"[453]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 458.]\r\n\r\nHer greatest grief was that she could not pray in church as often as\r\nshe would like. Every day she repeated: \"If we could, we should do\r\nwell to hear mass.\"[454]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 438.]\r\n\r\nAs they avoided high roads they were not often in the way of bridges;\r\nand they were frequently forced to ford rivers in flood. They crossed\r\nthe Aube, near Bar-sur-Aube, the Seine near Bar-sur-Seine, the Yonne\r\nopposite Auxerre, where Jeanne heard mass in the church of\r\nSaint-Etienne; then they reached the town of Gien, on the right bank\r\nof the Loire.[455]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 54; vol. ii, p. 437.]\r\n\r\nAt length these Lorrainers beheld a French town loyal to the King of\r\nFrance. They had travelled seventy-five leagues through the enemy's\r\ncountry without being attacked or molested. Afterwards this was\r\nconsidered miraculous. But was it impossible for seven or eight\r\nArmagnac horsemen to traverse English and Burgundian lands without\r\nmisadventure? The Commander of Vaucouleurs frequently sent letters to\r\nthe Dauphin which reached him, and the Dauphin was in the habit of\r\ndespatching messengers to the Commander; Colet de Vienne had just\r\nborne his message.[456]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 406, 432, 445, 448, 457.]\r\n\r\nIn point of fact the followers of the Dauphin ran risks well nigh as\r\ngreat in the provinces under his sway as in lands subject to other\r\nmasters.[457]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: Monstrelet, vol. v, p. 269.

Indeed, it was after their passage of the\r\nLoire that Bertrand de Poulengy and his companions found themselves\r\nexposed to the greatest danger.\r\n\r\nInformed of their approach, certain men-at-arms of the French party\r\nwent before and lay in ambush, waiting to surprise them. They intended\r\nto capture the damsel, cast her into a pit, and keep her there beneath\r\na great stone, in the hope that the King who had sent for her would\r\ngive a large sum for her rescue.[458] It was the custom for\r\nfreebooters and mercenaries thus to cast travellers into pits\r\ndelivering them on payment of ransom. Eighteen years before, at\r\nCorbeil, five men had been kept in a pit on bread and water by\r\nBurgundians. Three of them died, being unable to pay the ransom.[459]\r\nSuch a fate very nearly befell Jeanne. But the wretches who were lying\r\nin wait for her, at the moment when they should have struck did\r\nnothing, wherefore is unknown, perhaps because they were afraid of not\r\nbeing the stronger.[460]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: Abbe J.-J.

According\r\nto popular belief the origin of her worship in this place was warlike\r\nand national and dated back to the beginning of French history. It was\r\nknown that after his victory over the Saracens at Poitiers Charles\r\nMartel had placed his sword in the oratory of the Blessed\r\nCatherine.[462] But it must be admitted that since then the sanctuary\r\nhad long suffered from desertion and neglect. Rather more than forty\r\nyears before the coming of the damsel from Domremy, its walls in the\r\ndepths of a wood were overrun by briers and brambles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 56, 75; vol. iii, pp. 3, 21; vol.\r\nv, p. 378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: That Saint Catherine was known in the west shortly\r\nbefore the Crusades is possible, but not that her worship should date\r\nback to Charles Martel; at any rate it flourished in the days of\r\nJeanne d'Arc. _Cf._ H. Moranville, _Un pelerinage en Terre sainte et\r\nau Sinai au XV'e siecle_, in the _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des\r\nChartes_, vol. lxvi (1905), pp. 70 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn those days it was not uncommon for saints of both sexes, if they\r\nhad suffered from some unjust neglect, to come and complain to some\r\npious person of the wrong being done them on earth. They appeared\r\npossibly to a monk, to a peasant or a citizen, denounced the impiety\r\nof the faithful in terms urgent and sometimes violent, and commanded\r\nhim to reinstate their worship and restore their sanctuary. And this\r\nis what Madame Saint Catherine did. In the year 1375 she entrusted a\r\nknight of the neighbourhood of Fierbois, one Jean Godefroy, who was\r\nblind and paralysed, with the restoration of her oratory to its old\r\nbrilliance and fame, promising to cure him if he would pray for nine\r\ndays in the place where Charles Martel had put his sword. Jean\r\nGodefroy had himself carried to the deserted chapel, but beforehand\r\nhis servants must perforce hew a way through the thicket with their\r\naxes. Madame Saint Catherine restored to Jean Godefroy the use of his\r\neyes and his limbs, and it was by this benefit that she recalled to\r\nthe people of Touraine the glory they had slighted. The oratory was\r\nrepaired; the faithful again wended their way thither, and miracles\r\nabounded. At first the saint healed the sick; then, when the land was\r\nravaged by war, it was her office more especially to deliver from the\r\nhands of the English such prisoners as had recourse to her. Sometimes\r\nshe rendered captives invisible to their guards; sometimes she broke\r\nbonds, chains, and locks; to wit, those of a nobleman by name Cazin du\r\nBoys, who in 1418 was taken with the garrison of Beaumont-sur-Oise.\r\nLocked in an iron cage, bound with a strong rope on which slept a\r\nBurgundian, he thought on Madame Saint Catherine, and dedicated\r\nhimself to this glorious virgin. Immediately the cage was opened.\r\nSometimes she even constrained the English to unchain their prisoners\r\nthemselves and set them free without ransom. That was a great miracle.\r\nOne no less great was worked by her on Perrot Chapon, of\r\nSaint-Sauveur, near Luzarches. For a month Perrot had been in bonds in\r\nan English prison, when he dedicated himself to Saint Catherine and\r\nfell asleep. He awoke, still bound, in his own house.\r\n\r\nGenerally she helped those who helped themselves. Such was the case of\r\nJean Ducoudray, citizen of Saumur, a prisoner in the castle of Belleme\r\nin 1429. He commended his soul devoutly to Saint Catherine, then\r\nleapt forth, throttled the guard, climbed the ramparts, dropped the\r\nheight of two lances, and went out a free man into the country.[463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: _Les miracles de Madame Sainte Katerine_, _passim_. G.\r\nLaunay, Article in _Bull. soc. archeol. du Vendomois_, 1880, vol. xix,\r\npp. 23-25.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps these miracles would have been less frequent had the English\r\nbeen in greater force in France; but their men were few: in Normandy\r\nthey intrenched themselves in towns, abandoning the open country to\r\nsoldiers of fortune who ranged the district and captured convoys, thus\r\ngreatly promoting the intervention of Madame Saint Catherine.[464]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La guerre des partisans dans la\r\nHaute Normandie_ (1424-1429), in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_\r\n(1893-1896).]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, who had become her votaries and whom she had delivered,\r\ndischarged their vows by making the pilgrimage to Fierbois. In her\r\nchapel there, they hung the cords and chains with which they had been\r\nbound, their armour, and sometimes, in special cases, the armour of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThis had been done nine months before Jeanne's coming to Fierbois by a\r\ncertain knight, Jean du Chastel. He had escaped from the hands of a\r\ncaptain, who accused him of having committed treason thereby, alleging\r\nthat du Chastel had given him his word of honour. Du Chastel on the\r\nother hand maintained that he had not sworn, and he challenged the\r\ncaptain to meet him in single combat. The issue of the combat proved\r\nright to be on the side of the French knight; for with the aid of\r\nMadame Saint Catherine he was victorious. In return he came to\r\nFierbois to offer to his holy protectress the armour of the vanquished\r\nEnglishman, in the presence of my Lord, the Bastard of Orleans, of\r\nCaptain La Hire and several other nobles.[465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: _Les miracles de Madame Sainte Katerine_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nJeanne must have delighted to hear tell of such miracles, or others\r\nlike them, and to see so many weapons hanging from the chapel walls.\r\nShe must have been well pleased that the saint who visited her at all\r\nhours and gave her counsel should so manifestly appear the friend of\r\npoor soldiers and peasants cast into bonds, cages and pits, or hanged\r\non trees by the _Godons_.\r\n\r\nShe prayed in the chapel and heard two masses.[466]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF ORLEANS FROM THE 12TH OF OCTOBER, 1428, TILL THE 6TH OF\r\nMARCH, 1429\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the victory of Verneuil and the conquest of Maine, the English\r\nhad advanced but little in France and their actual possessions there\r\nwere becoming less and less secure.[467] If they spared the lands of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans it was not on account of any scruple. Albeit on\r\nthe banks of the Loire it was held dishonourable to seize the domains\r\nof a noble when he was a prisoner,[468] everything is fair in war. The\r\nRegent had not scrupled to seize the duchy of Alencon when its duke\r\nwas a prisoner.[469] The truth is that by bribes and entreaties the\r\ngood Duke Charles dissuaded the English from attacking his duchy. From\r\n1424 until 1426 the citizens of Orleans purchased peace by money\r\npayments.[470] The _Godons_, not being in a position to take the\r\nfield, were all the more ready to enter into such agreements. During\r\nthe minority of their half English and half French King, the Duke of\r\nGloucester, the brother and deputy of the Regent, and his uncle, the\r\nBishop of Winchester, Chancellor of the Kingdom, were tearing out each\r\nother's hair, and their disputes were the occasion of bloodshed in the\r\nLondon streets.[471] Towards the end of the year 1425 the Regent\r\nreturned to England, where he spent seventeen months reconciling uncle\r\nand nephew and restoring public peace. By dint of craft and vigour he\r\nsucceeded so far as to render his fellow countrymen desirous and\r\nhopeful of completing the conquest of France. With that object, in\r\n1428, the English Parliament voted subsidies.[472]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 190.

At present he was gathering an army in\r\nEngland, intended for the banks of the Loire. He got as many bowmen as\r\nhe wanted; but of horse and men-at-arms he was disappointed. Only\r\nthose of low estate were willing to go and fight in a land ravaged by\r\nfamine.[474] At length the noble earl, the fair cousin of King Henry,\r\ncrossed the sea with four hundred and forty-nine men-at-arms and two\r\nthousand two hundred and fifty archers.[475] In France he found troops\r\nrecruited by the Regent, four hundred horse of whom two hundred were\r\nNorman, with three bowmen to each horseman, according to the English\r\ncustom.[476] He led his men to Paris where irrevocable resolutions\r\nwere taken.[477] Hitherto the plan had been to attack Angers; at the\r\nlast moment it was decided to lay siege to Orleans.[478]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: L.

L. Jarry, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nBetween la Beauce and la Sologne, at the entrance to the loyal\r\nprovinces Touraine, Blesois, and Berry, the ducal city confronted the\r\nenemy, lying on a bend of the Loire, just as the arrow's point is\r\nlodged on the taut bow.[479] Bishopric, university, market of the\r\ncountry far and wide, on its belfries, towers, and steeples it raised\r\nproudly towards heaven the cross of Our Lord, the three _coeurs de\r\nlis_ of the city and the three _fleurs de lis_ of the dukes. Beneath\r\nthe high slate roofs of its houses of stone or wood, built along\r\nwinding streets or dark alleys, Orleans sheltered fifteen thousand\r\nsouls. There were to be found officers of justice and of the treasury,\r\ngoldsmiths, druggists, grocers, tanners, butchers, fishmongers, rich\r\ncitizens as delicate as amber, who loved fine clothes, fine houses,\r\nmusic and dancing; priests, canons, wardens, and fellows of the\r\nuniversity; booksellers, scriveners, illuminators, painters, scholars\r\nwho were not all founts of learning, but who played prettily on the\r\nflute; monks of every habit, Black-friars, Grey-friars, Mathurins,\r\nCarmelites, Augustinians, and artisans and labourers to boot, smiths,\r\ncoopers, carpenters, boatmen, fishermen.[480]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: Le Maire, _Antiquites_, p. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Astesan in _Paris et ses historiens_, by Le Roux de\r\nLincy and Tisserand, pp. 528 _et seq._ Le Maire, _Antiquites_, ch.\r\nxix, pp. 75 _et seq._ P.

The southern side along the Loire and\r\nthe northern side extended to some three thousand feet. The eastern\r\nand western boundaries were only one hundred and fifty feet long. The\r\ncity was surrounded by walls six feet thick and from eighteen to\r\nthirty-three feet high above the moat. These walls were flanked by\r\nthirty-four towers, pierced with five gates and two posterns.[481] The\r\nfollowing is the description of the situation of these gates,\r\nposterns, and towers, with the names of those which became famous\r\nduring the siege.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: Jollois, _Histoire du siege d'Orleans_, Paris, 1833, in\r\n4to, with plans. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, pp. 183 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nPassing from the south east to the south west angle of the wall, were:\r\nLa Tour Neuve, round and huge, washed by the Loire; three other towers\r\non the river bank; the postern Chesneau, the only one opening on to\r\nthe water and defended by a portcullis; the tower of La\r\nCroiche-Meuffroy, so called from the crook or spur which protruded\r\nfrom the foot of the tower into the river; two other towers washed by\r\nthe Loire; La Port du Pont, with drawbridge and flanked by two towers;\r\nLa Tour de l'Abreuvoir; la Tour de Notre-Dame, deriving its name from\r\na chapel built against the city walls; la Tour de la Barre-Flambert,\r\nthe last on this side, at the south west angle of the ramparts and\r\ncommanding the river. All along the Loire the walls had a stone\r\nparapet with machicolated battlements, whence pavingstones could be\r\nthrown, and whence, when attempts were made to scale the walls, the\r\nenemy's ladders could be hurled down. The distance between the towers\r\nwas about a bow-shot.\r\n\r\nOn the western side were first three towers, then two gate towers\r\ncalled Regnard or Renard from the name of citizens to whom had once\r\nbelonged the adjoining palace, where in 1428 dwelt Jacques Boucher,\r\nTreasurer of the Duke of Orleans. Then came another tower and lastly\r\nLa Porte Bernier or Bannier, at the north west angle of the ramparts.\r\nOn this side the walls had been constructed in the days of the\r\ncross-bow, which shot a greater distance than the bow. The towers\r\nhere, therefore, were farther apart at the distance of a cross-bow\r\nshot one from the other, and the walls were lower than elsewhere. On\r\nthe northern side, looking towards the forest, were ten towers at a\r\nbow-shot's interval. The second, that of Saint-Samson, was used as an\r\narsenal. The sixth and seventh flanked the Paris Gate.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side were likewise ten towers at the same distance one\r\nfrom the other as those on the north. The fifth and sixth were those\r\nof the Burgundian Gate, also called the Gate of Saint-Aignan, because\r\nit was close to the church of Saint-Aignan without the walls; the last\r\nwas the great corner tower, called La Tour Neuve, which thus comes to\r\nhave been twice counted.\r\n\r\nThe stone bridge lined with houses which led from the town to the left\r\nbank of the Loire was famous all over the world. It had nineteen\r\narches of varying breadth. The first, on leaving the town by La Porte\r\ndu Pont, was called l'Allouee or Pont Jacquemin-Rousselet; here was a\r\ndrawbridge. The fifth arch abutted on an island which was long,\r\nnarrow, and in the form of a boat, like all river islands. Above the\r\nbridge it was called Motte-Saint-Antoine, from a chapel built upon it\r\ndedicated to that saint; and below, Motte-des-Poissonniers, because in\r\norder to keep captured fish alive boats with holes in them were moored\r\nto it. In 1447, to provide against the occupation of this island by\r\nthe enemy, the people of Orleans had constructed a tower, the tower or\r\nfortress of Saint-Antoine, beyond the sixth arch and occupying the\r\nwhole breadth of the bridge. On the buttress between the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth arch was a cross of gilded bronze, supported by a pedestal of\r\nstone. It was indeed what it was called, the Cross Beautiful,--La\r\nBelle-Croix. The buttresses of the eighteenth arch were extended, and\r\non the abutment there rose a little castle formed of two towers joined\r\nby a vaulted porch. This little castle was called Les Tourelles.\r\nBetween the nineteenth and the twentieth arch as in the first was a\r\ndrawbridge. Outside it was Le Portereau; and thence ran the road to\r\nToulouse, which beyond the Loiret on the heights of Olivet joined the\r\nroad to Blois.[482]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: Jollois, _Lettre a Messieurs les membres de la Societe\r\ndes Antiquaires de France, sur l'emplacement du fort des Tourelles de\r\nl'ancien pont d'Orleans_, Paris, 1834, in folio with illustrations.\r\nAbbe Dubois, _Histoire du siege_, dissertation, v.

Two and a\r\nhalf miles east of Orleans, on the height of Checy, l'Ile aux Bourdons\r\nwas separated from the Sologne bank by a thin arm of the river and by\r\na narrow channel from l'Ile Charlemagne and l'Ile-aux-Boeufs, with\r\ntheir green grass and underwood facing Combleux on the La Beauce bank.\r\nA boat dropping down the river would next come to the two islands\r\nSaint-Loup, and, doubling La Tour Neuve, would glide between the two\r\nMartinet Islets on the right and l'Ile-aux-Toiles on the left. Thence\r\nit would pass under the bridge which overspanned, as we have seen, an\r\nisland called above bridge Motte-Saint-Antoine and below,\r\nMotte-des-Poissonniers. At length, below the ramparts, opposite\r\nSaint-Laurent-des-Orgerils, it would come to two islets Biche-d'Orge\r\nand another, the name of which is unknown, possibly it was\r\nnameless.[483]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: For some unknown reason modern historians have named\r\nthe little island to the right of Saint-Laurent l'Ile Charlemagne,\r\nwhich causes it to be confused with the Ile Charlemagne lying to the\r\nEast of l'Ile-aux-Boeufs. On the accompanying plan we indicate the\r\nlittle island just below Biche-d'Orge by the name of Petite Ile\r\nCharlemagne. Jollois, _Histoire du siege_, engraving 1.

On the south\r\nthe fishermen's suburb of Le Portereau, with its Augustinian church\r\nand monastery, extended along the river at the foot of the vineyards\r\nof Saint-Jean-le-Blanc, which produced the best wine in the\r\ncountry.[484] Above, on the gentle slopes ascending to the bleak\r\nplateau of Sologne, the Loiret, with its torrential springs, its\r\nlimpid waters, its shady banks, the gardens and the brooks of Olivet,\r\nsmiled beneath a mild and showery sky.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: Symphorien Guyon, _Histoire de l'eglise et diocese\r\nd'Orleans_, Orleans, 1647, vol. i, preface. Le Maire, _Antiquites_, p.\r\n36.]\r\n\r\nThe _faubourg_ of the Burgundian gate stretching eastwards was the\r\nbest built and the most populous. There were the wonderful churches of\r\nSaint-Michel and of Saint-Aignan. The cloister of the latter was held\r\nto be marvellous.[485] Leaving this suburb and passing by the\r\nvineyards along the sandy branch of the Loire extending between the\r\nbank of the river and l'Ile-aux-Boeufs about a quarter of a league\r\nfurther on, one comes to the steep slope of Saint-Loup; and, advancing\r\nstill further towards the east, the belfries of Saint-Jean-de-Bray,\r\nCombleux and Checy may be seen rising one beyond the other between the\r\nriver and the Roman road from Autun to Paris. On the north of the city\r\nwere fine monasteries and beautiful churches, the chapel of\r\nSaint-Ladre, in the cemetery; the Jacobins, the Cordeliers, the church\r\nof Saint-Pierre-Ensentelee. Directly north, the _faubourg_ of La Porte\r\nBernier lay along the Paris road, and close by there stretched the\r\nsombre city of the wolves, the deep forest of oaks, horn-beams,\r\nbeeches, and willows, wherein were hidden, like wood-cutters and\r\ncharcoal-burners, the villages of Fleury and Samoy.[486]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: _Journal du siege_, pp. 13, 15. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 270.

Lottin, _Recherches sur\r\nOrleans_, vol. i, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Orleans were resolved to fight, not for their\r\nhonour indeed; in those days no honour redounded to a citizen from the\r\ndefence of his own city; his only reward was the risk of terrible\r\ndanger. When the town was captured the great and wealthy had but to\r\npay ransom and the conqueror entertained them well; the lesser and\r\npoorer nobility ran greater risks. In this year, 1428, the knights,\r\nwho defended Melun and surrendered after having eaten their horses and\r\ntheir dogs, were drowned in the Seine. \"Nobility was worth nothing,\"\r\nran a Burgundian song.[489]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: Le Roux de Lincy, _Chants historiques et populaires du\r\ntemps de Charles VII_, Paris, 1862, in 18mo, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nBut generally being of noble birth saved one's life. As for those\r\nburghers brave enough to defend themselves, they were likely to\r\nperish. There were no fixed rules with regard to them; sometimes\r\nseveral were hanged; sometimes only one, sometimes all. It was also\r\nlawful to cut off their heads or to throw them into the water, sewn in\r\na sack. In that same year, 1428, Captains La Hire and Poton had failed\r\nin their assault on Le Mans and decamped just in time. The citizens who\r\nhad aided them were beheaded in the square du Cloitre-Saint-Julien, on\r\nthe Olet stone, by order of William Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who had\r\nalready arrived at Olivet, and of John Talbot, the most courteous of\r\nEnglish knights, who was shortly to come there too.[490] Such an\r\nexample was sufficient to warn the people of Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 225, 226. _Geste\r\ndes nobles_, p. 202. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 251.

Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_,\r\npp. 107, 112.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that it was under the control of the Governor, the\r\ntown administered its own affairs by means of twelve magistrates\r\nelected for two years by the citizens, subject to the governor's\r\napprobation.[491] These magistrates risked more than the other\r\ncitizens. One of them, as he passed the monastery of Saint-Sulpice,\r\nwhere was the place of execution, might well reflect that before the\r\nyear was out he might have justice executed on him there for having\r\ndefended his lord's inheritance. Yet the twelve were resolved to\r\ndefend this inheritance; and they acted for the common weal with\r\npromptness and with wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, pp. 164, 171. P.\r\nMantellier, _Histoire du siege_, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe people of Orleans were not taken by surprise. Their fathers had\r\nwatched the English closely, and put their city in a state of defence.\r\nThey themselves, in the year 1425, had so firmly expected a siege that\r\nthey had collected arms in the Tower of Saint-Samson, while all, rich\r\nand poor alike, had been required to dig dykes and build\r\nramparts.[492] War has always been costly. They devoted three quarters\r\nof the yearly revenue of the town to keeping up the ramparts and other\r\npreparations for war. Hearing of the approach of the Earl of\r\nSalisbury, with marvellous energy they prepared to receive him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: _The Monk of Dunfermline_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 341.\r\nLe Maire, _Antiquites_, pp. 283 _et seq._ Lottin, _Recherches_, vol.\r\ni, pp. 160, 161.]\r\n\r\nThe walls, except those along the river, were devoid of breastwork;\r\nbut in the shops were stakes and cross-beams intended for the\r\nmanufacture of balustrades. These were put up on the fortifications to\r\nform parapets, with barbicans of a pent-house shape so as to provide\r\nwith cover the defenders firing from the walls.[493] At the entrance\r\nto each suburb wooden barriers were erected, with a lodge for the\r\nporter whose duty it was to open and shut them. On the tops of the\r\nramparts and in the towers were seventy-one pieces of artillery,\r\nincluding cannons and mortars, without counting culverins. The quarry\r\nof Montmaillard, three leagues from the town, produced stones which\r\nwere made into cannon balls. At great expense there were brought into\r\nthe city lead, powder, and sulphur which the women prepared for use in\r\nthe cannons and culverins. Every day there were manufactured in\r\nthousands, arrows, darts, stacks of bolts,[494] armed with iron points\r\nand feathered with parchment, numbers of _pavas_, great shields made\r\nof pieces of wood mortised one into the other and covered with\r\nleather. Corn, wine, and cattle were purchased in great quantities\r\nboth for the inhabitants and the men-at-arms, the King's men, and\r\nadventurers who were expected.[495]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: Jollois, _Histoire du siege_, p. 6.

According to their trades they were divided\r\ninto as many companies as there were towers. Thus defending themselves\r\nthey had the right to refuse to admit any garrison within the walls.\r\nThey held to this right because it delivered them from the pillage,\r\nthe rapine, the burnings and constant molestations inflicted by the\r\nKing's men. But now they were eager to renounce it; for they realised\r\nthat alone with only the town bands and those from the neighbouring\r\nvillages, mere peasants, they could not sustain the siege; to resist\r\nthe enemy they must have horsemen, skilled in wielding the lance, and\r\nfoot, skilled in the use of the cross-bow. While their Governor the\r\nSire de Gaucourt and my Lord, the Bastard of Orleans, the King's\r\nLieutenant General, went to Chinon and Poitiers to obtain supplies of\r\nmen and money[496] from the King, the citizens in commissions of two\r\nand two went forth asking help of the towns, travelling as far as\r\nBourbonnais and Languedoc.[497] The magistrates appealed to those\r\nsoldiers of fortune who held the neighbouring country for the King of\r\nFrance. By the mouths of the two heralds of the city, Orleans and\r\nCoeur-de-Lis, they proclaimed that within the city walls were gold\r\nand silver in abundance and such good provision of victuals and arms\r\nas would nourish and accoutre two thousand combatants for two years,\r\nand that every gentle, honest knight who would might share in the\r\ndefence of the city and wage battle to the death.[498]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: Accounts of Hemon Raguier, Bibl.

In those days God was greatly\r\nto be feared; he was almost as terrible as in the days of the\r\nPhilistines. The poor fisher folk were afraid of being repulsed if\r\nthey addressed him in their affliction; they thought it better to take\r\na roundabout road and to seek the intercession of Our Lady and the\r\nsaints. God respected his Mother and sought to please her on every\r\noccasion. Likewise he deferred to the wishes of the Blessed, seated on\r\nhis right hand and on his left in Paradise, and he inclined his ear to\r\nlisten to the petitions they presented to him. Thus in cases of dire\r\nnecessity it was customary to solicit the favour of the saints by\r\npresenting prayers and offerings. Then also did the citizens of\r\nOrleans remember Saint Euverte and Saint-Aignan, the patrons of their\r\ntown. In very ancient days Saint Euverte had sat upon that episcopal\r\nseat, now, in 1428, occupied by a Scot. Messire Jean de Saint Michel,\r\nand Saint Euverte had shone with all the glory of apostolic\r\nvirtue.[499] His successor, Saint-Aignan had prayed to God. He had\r\nregarded the city in a peril like unto that of which it was now in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: _Journal du siege_, p. 51. _Chronique de la fete_ in\r\nthe _Trial_, vol. v, p. 296. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, pp. 27-31.]\r\n\r\nThe following is his story as it was known to the people of Orleans.\r\nWhen still young, Saint-Aignan had withdrawn to a solitary place near\r\nOrleans. There Saint Euverte, at that time bishop of the city,\r\ndiscovered him. He ordained him priest, appointed him Abbot of\r\nSaint-Laurent-des-Orgerils, and elected him to succeed him in the\r\ngovernment of the faithful. And when Saint Euverte had passed from\r\nthis life to the other, the blessed Aignan, with the consent of the\r\npeople of Orleans, was proclaimed bishop by the voice of a little\r\nchild. For God, who is praised out of the mouths of babes, permitted\r\none of them, borne in his swaddling clothes to the altar, to speak and\r\nsay: \"Aignan, Aignan is chosen of God to be bishop of this town.\" Now\r\nin the sixtieth year of his pontificate, the Huns invaded Gaul, led by\r\ntheir King Attila, who boasted that wherever he went the stars fell\r\nand the earth trembled beneath him, that he was the hammer of the\r\nworld, _stellas pre se cadere, terram tremere, se malleum esse\r\nuniversi orbis_. Every town on his march had been destroyed by him,\r\nand now he was advancing against Orleans. Then the blessed Aignan went\r\nforth into the city of Arles, to the Patrician Aetius, who commanded\r\nthe Roman army, and implored his aid in so great a peril. Having\r\nobtained of the Patrician promise of succour, Aignan returned to his\r\nepiscopal see, which he found surrounded by barbarian warriors. The\r\nHuns, having made breaches in the walls, were preparing an assault.\r\nThe blessed saint went up on to the ramparts, knelt and prayed, and\r\nthen, having prayed, spat upon the enemy. By God's will that drop of\r\nhis saliva was followed by all the raindrops in the sky. A tempest\r\narose: the rain fell in such torrents on the barbarians that their\r\ncamp was flooded; their tents were overturned by the power of the\r\nwinds, and many among them perished by lightning. The rain lasted for\r\nthree days, after which time Attila assailed the ramparts with\r\npowerful engines of war. When they saw the walls fall down the\r\ninhabitants were terrified. All hope of resistance being at an end,\r\nthe holy bishop, clad in his episcopal robes, went to the King of the\r\nHuns and adjured him to take pity on the people of Orleans,\r\nthreatening him with the wrath of God if he dealt hardly with the\r\nconquered. These prayers and these threats did not soften Attila's\r\nheart. On his return to the faithful, the bishop warned them that\r\nhenceforth nothing remained to them but trust in God; divine succour,\r\nhowever, would not fail them. And soon, according to the promise he\r\nhad given them, God delivered the town by means of the Romans and the\r\nFranks, who defied the Huns in a great battle. Not long after the\r\nmiraculous deliverance of his beloved city, Saint Aignan fell asleep\r\nin the Lord.[500]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: Hubert, _Antiquitez historiques de l'eglise royale de\r\nSaint-Aignan d'Orleans_, 1661, in 8vo, pp. 1-15.]\r\n\r\nWherefore, in this great peril of the English, the citizens of Orleans\r\nresorted to Saint Euverte and Saint-Aignan for succour and relief.\r\nAccording to the marvels accomplished by Saint-Aignan in this mortal\r\nlife they measured his power of working miracles now that he was in\r\nParadise. These two confessors had each his church in the faubourg de\r\nBourgogne, wherein their bodies were jealously guarded.[501] In those\r\ndays the bones of martyrs and confessors were devoutly worshipped. It\r\nwas said that sometimes they shed abroad a healing odour which\r\nrepresented the virtues proceeding from them. They were enclosed in\r\ngilded reliquaries adorned with precious stones, and no miracle was\r\nthought too great to be accomplished by these holy relics. On the 6th\r\nof August, 1428, the clergy of the city went to the church wherein was\r\nthe reliquary of Saint Euverte and bore it round the walls, that they\r\nmight be strengthened. And the holy reliquary made the round of the\r\nwhole city, followed by all the people. On the 8th of September a\r\n_tortis_ weighing one hundred and ten livres[502] was offered to\r\nSaint-Aignan. In time of need the favour of the saints was solicited\r\nby all kinds of gifts, garments, jewels, coins, houses, lands, woods,\r\nponds; but natural wax was thought to be especially grateful to them.\r\nA _tortis_ was a wheel of wax on which candles were placed and two\r\nescutcheons bearing the arms of the city.[503]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 32. _Journal du siege_, p. 14.\r\nHubert, _loc. cit._, chs. iii, iv. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, pp.\r\n82, 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: A livre varied in weight from province to province;\r\ngenerally it was about seventeen ounces (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: Le Maire, _Antiquites_, p. 285. P. Mantellier,\r\n_Histoire du siege_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nThus did the people of Orleans strive to provision and protect their\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nAdventurers from all parts responded to the magistrates' appeal. The\r\nfirst to hasten to the city were: Messire Archambaud de Villars,\r\nGovernor of Montargis; Guillaume de Chaumont, Lord of Guitry; Messire\r\nPierre de la Chapelle, a baron of La Beauce; Raimond Arnaud de\r\nCorraze, knight of Bearn; Don Matthias of Aragon; Jean de Saintrailles\r\nand Poton de Saintrailles. The Abbot of Cerquenceaux, sometime student\r\nat the University of Orleans, arrived at the head of a band of\r\nfollowers.[504] Thus the number of friends who entered the city was\r\nwell-nigh as great as that of the expected foe. The defenders were\r\npaid; they were furnished with bread, meat, fish, forage in plenty,\r\nand casks of wine were broached for them. In the beginning the\r\ninhabitants treated them like their own children. The citizens all\r\ncontributed to the entertainment of the strangers, and gave them what\r\nthey had. But this concord did not long endure. Whatever tradition\r\nalleges as to the friendly relations subsisting between the citizens\r\nand their military guests,[505] affairs in Orleans were in truth not\r\ndifferent from what they were in other besieged towns; before long the\r\ninhabitants began to complain of the garrison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 257, 258. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, pp. 6, 7. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, p. 204. J. Devaux, _Le\r\nGatinais au temps de Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Ann. Soc. hist. et arch. du\r\nGatinais_, vol. v, 1887, p. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: _Journal du siege_, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September the Earl of Salisbury reached Janville, having\r\ntaken with ease towns, fortified churches or castles to the number of\r\nforty. But that was not his greatest achievement; for, although he had\r\nleft but few men in each place, he had by that means rid himself on\r\nthe march of that portion of his army which had already shown itself\r\nready to drop away.[506]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: _Geste des Nobles_, p. 204. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 256. Letter from Salisbury to the Commons of London, in Delpit,\r\n_Collection de documents francais qui se trouvent en Angleterre_, pp.\r\n236, 237. Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_, pp. 79-89.]\r\n\r\nFrom Janville he sent two heralds to Orleans to summon the inhabitants\r\nto surrender. The magistrates lodged these heralds honourably in the\r\nfaubourg Bannier, at the Hotel de la Pomme and confided to them a\r\npresent of wine for the Earl of Salisbury; they knew their duty to so\r\ngreat a prince. But they refused to open their gates to the English\r\ngarrison, alleging, doubtless, as was the custom of citizens in those\r\ndays, that they were not able to open them, having those within who\r\nwere stronger than they.[507]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: Abbe Dubois, _Histoire du siege_, p. 11. Jarry, _Le\r\ncompte de l'armee anglaise_, p. 82. Boucher de Molandon, _Les comptes\r\nde ville d'Orleans des quatorzieme et quinzieme siecles_, Orleans,\r\n1880, in 8vo, pp. 91 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nNow that the danger was drawing near, on the 6th of October, priests,\r\nburgesses, notables, merchants, mechanics, women and children walked\r\nin solemn procession with crosses and banners, singing psalms and\r\ninvoking the heavenly guardians of the city.[508]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, p. 205. P. Mantellier,\r\n_Histoire du siege_, p. 17.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 12th of this month, at the news that the enemy was\r\ncoming through Sologne, the magistrates sent soldiers to pull down the\r\nhouses of Le Portereau, the suburb on the left bank, also the\r\nAugustinian church and monastery of that suburb, as well as all other\r\nbuildings in which the enemy might lodge or entrench himself. But the\r\nsoldiers were taken by surprise. That very day the English occupied\r\nOlivet and appeared in Le Portereau.[509] With them were the victors\r\nof Verneuil, the flower of English knighthood: Thomas, Lord of Scales\r\nand of Nucelles, Governor of Pontorson, whom the King of England\r\ncalled cousin; William Neville; Baron Falconbridge; William Gethyn, a\r\nWelsh knight, Bailie of Evreux; Lord Richard Gray, nephew of the Earl\r\nof Salisbury; Gilbert Halsall, Richard Panyngel, Thomas Guerard,\r\nknights, and many others of great renown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: _Journal du siege_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nOver the two hundred lances from Normandy there floated the standards\r\nof William Pole, Earl of Suffolk, and of John Pole, two brothers\r\ndescended from a comrade-in-arms of Duke William; of Thomas Rampston,\r\nknight banneret, the Regent's chamberlain; of Richard Walter, squire,\r\nGovernor of Conches, Bailie and Captain of Evreux; of William Mollins,\r\nknight; of William Glasdale, whom the French called Glacidas, squire,\r\nBailie of Alencon, a man of humble birth.[510]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: _Journal du siege_, pp. 2-4. Boucher de Molandon et de\r\nBeaucorps, _L'armee anglaise vaincue par Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nThe archers were all on horseback. There were practically no\r\nfoot-soldiers. In carts drawn by oxen were barrels of powder,\r\ncross-bows, arrows, cannon-balls, and guns of all kinds, muskets,\r\nfowling-pieces, and large cannon. The two English master-gunners,\r\nPhilibert de Moslant and William Appleby, accompanied the troops.\r\nThere were also two masters of mining with thirty-eight workmen. Of\r\nwomen there were not a few, some of them acting as spies.[511]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: L. Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_, pp. 26, 28,\r\n29. Boucher de Molandon and de Beaucorps, _L'armee anglaise vaincue\r\npar Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 50 _et seq._ Mademoiselle A. de Villaret,\r\n_Campagne des anglais_, ch. iv, pp. 39, 53; Accounts of the siege,\r\nnos. 30, 31, p. 214. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, p. 205.]\r\n\r\nWhen the army arrived it was greatly diminished by desertions, having\r\nshed runaways at each victory. Some returned to England, others roamed\r\nthrough the realm of France robbing and plundering. That very 12th of\r\nOctober orders had been despatched from Rouen to the Bailies and\r\nGovernors of Normandy to arrest those English who had departed from\r\nthe company of my Lord, the Earl of Salisbury.[512]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: L. Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe fort of Les Tourelles and its outworks barred the entrance to the\r\nbridge. The English established themselves in Le Portereau, placed their\r\ncannon and their mortars on the rising ground of Saint-Jean-le-Blanc,[513]\r\nand, on the following Sunday, they hurled down upon the city a shower\r\nof stone cannon-balls, which did great damage to the houses, but\r\nkilled no one save a woman of Orleans, named Belles, who dwelt near\r\nthe Chesneau postern on the river bank. Thus the siege, which was to\r\nbe ended by a woman's victory, began with a woman's death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 258. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, p. 66. Jean Raoulet in Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. iii,\r\np. 198. _Journal du siege_, pp. 1, 2. Abbe Dubois, _Histoire du\r\nsiege_, p. 246. P. Mantellier, _Histoire du siege_, p. 27. H. Baraude,\r\n_Le siege d'Orleans et Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nThat same week the English cannon destroyed twelve water mills near La\r\nTour Neuve. Whereupon the people of Orleans constructed within the\r\ncity eleven mills worked by horses,[514] in order that there might be\r\nno lack of flour. There were a few skirmishes at the bridge. Then on\r\nThursday, the 21st of October, the English attempted to storm the\r\noutworks of Les Tourelles. The little band of adventurers in the\r\nservice of the town and the city troops made a gallant defence. The\r\nwomen helped; throughout the four hours that the assault lasted long\r\nlines of gossips might be seen hurrying to the bridge, bearing their\r\npots and pans filled with burning coals and boiling oil and fat,\r\nfrantic with joy at the idea of scalding the _Godons_.[515] The attack\r\nwas repulsed; but two days later the French perceived that the\r\noutworks were undermined; the English had dug subterranean passages,\r\nto the props of which they had afterwards set fire. The outworks\r\nhaving become untenable in the opinion of the soldiers, they were\r\ndestroyed and abandoned. It was deemed impossible to defend Les\r\nTourelles thus dismantled. Those towers which would once have\r\narrested an army's progress for a whole month were now useless against\r\ncannon. In front of La Belle Croix the townsfolk erected a rampart of\r\nearth and wood. Beyond this outwork two arches of the bridge were cut\r\nand replaced by a movable platform. And when this was done, the fort\r\nof Les Tourelles was abandoned to the English with no great regret.\r\nThe latter set up a rampart of earth and faggots on the bridge,\r\nbreaking two of its arches, one in front, the other behind their\r\nearthwork.[516]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: _Journal du siege_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: _Ibid._, pp. 7-8. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, pp.\r\n208, 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: _Journal du siege_, pp. 5-8.]\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, towards evening, a few hours after the flag of St.\r\nGeorge had been planted on the fort, the Earl of Salisbury, with\r\nWilliam Glasdale and several captains, went up one of the towers to\r\nobserve the lie of the city. Looking from a window he beheld the walls\r\narmed with cannon; the towers vanishing into pinnacles or with\r\nterraces on their flat roofs; the battlements dry and grey; the\r\nsuburbs adorned for a few days longer with the fine stone-work of\r\ntheir churches and monasteries; the vineyards and the woods yellow\r\nwith autumn tints; the Loire and its oval-shaped islands,--all\r\nslumbering in the evening calm. He was looking for the weak point in\r\nthe ramparts, the place where he might make a breach and put up his\r\nscaling ladders. For his plan was to take Orleans by assault. William\r\nGlasdale said to him, \"My Lord, look well at your city. You have a\r\ngood bird's-eye view of it from here.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a cannon-ball breaks off a corner of the window recess,\r\na stone from the wall strikes Salisbury, carrying away one eye and one\r\nside of his face. The shot had been fired from La Tour Notre-Dame.\r\nThat at least was generally believed. It was never known who had fired\r\nit. A townsman, alarmed by the noise, hastened to the spot, saw a\r\nchild coming out of the tower and the cannon deserted. It was thought\r\nthat the hand of an innocent child had fired the bullet by the\r\npermission of the Mother of God, who had been irritated by the Earl of\r\nSalisbury's despoiling monks and pillaging the Church of Notre Dame de\r\nClery. It was said also that he was punished for having broken his\r\noath, for he had promised the Duke of Orleans to respect his lands and\r\nhis towns. Borne secretly to Meung-sur-Loire, he died there on\r\nWednesday the 27th of October; and the English were very\r\nsorrowful.[517] Most of them felt that loss to be irreparable which\r\nhad deprived them of a chief who was conducting the siege vigorously,\r\nand who in less than twelve days had captured Les Tourelles, the very\r\ncorner-stone of the city's defence. But there were others who\r\nreflected that he must have been very simple to imagine that thick\r\nramparts could be overthrown by stone balls, the force of which had\r\nalready been spent in crossing the wide stretches of the river, and\r\nthat he must have been mad to attempt to storm a city which could only\r\nbe reduced by famine. Then they thought: \"He is dead. God receive his\r\nsoul! But he has brought us into a sorry plight.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: _Journal du siege_, pp. 10, 12. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 264.

A Norman clerk composed two songs on this sad death,\r\none against the English, the other for them. The first, which is the\r\nbetter, closes with a couplet, worthy in its profound wisdom of King\r\nSolomon himself:[519]\r\n\r\n    Certes le duc de Bedefort\r\n    Se sage est, il se tendra\r\n    Avec sa femme en ung fort,\r\n    Chaudement le mieulx[520] que il porra,\r\n    De bon ypocras finera,\r\n    Garde son corps, lesse la guerre:\r\n    Povre et riche porrist en terre.[521]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 345. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n263. _Journal du siege_, p. 10.

He will drink\r\ngood hypocras (a kind of wine). He looks after himself, leaves warfare\r\nand the poor and rich to rot in the ground.]\r\n\r\nThe day after the taking of Les Tourelles and when its loss had been\r\nremedied as best might be, the King's lieutenant-general entered the\r\ntown. He was le Seigneur Jean, Count of Porcien and of Montaing, Grand\r\nChamberlain of France, son of Duke Louis of Orleans, who had been\r\nassassinated in 1407 by order of Jean-Sans-Peur, and whose death had\r\narmed the Armagnacs against the Burgundians. Dame de Cany was his\r\nmother, but he ought to have been the son of the Duchess of Orleans\r\nsince the Duke was his father. Not only was it no drawback to children\r\nto be born outside wedlock and of an adulterous union, but it was a\r\ngreat honor to be called the bastard of a prince. There have never\r\nbeen so many bastards as during these wars, and the saying ran:\r\n\"Children are like corn: sow stolen wheat and it will sprout as well\r\nas any other.\"[522] The Bastard of Orleans was then twenty-six at the\r\nmost. The year before, with a small company, he had hastened to\r\nrevictual the inhabitants of Montargis, who were besieged by the Earl\r\nof Warwick. He had not only revictualled the town; but with the help\r\nof Captain La Hire had driven away the besiegers. This augured well\r\nfor Orleans.[523] The Bastard was the cleverest baron of his day. He\r\nknew grammar and astrology, and spoke more correctly than any\r\none.[524] In his affability and intelligence he resembled his father,\r\nbut he was more cautious and more temperate. His amiability, his\r\ncourtesy and his discretion caused it to be said that he was in favour\r\nwith all the ladies, even with the Queen.[525] In everything he was\r\napt, in war as well as in diplomacy, marvellously adroit, and a\r\nconsummate dissembler.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i,\r\np. 25; vol. ii, p. 389.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 273, 274. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, pp. 243, 247.

These knights came with a company of eight hundred men,\r\narchers, arbalesters, and Italian foot, bearing broad shields like\r\nthose of St. George in the churches of Venice and Florence. They\r\nrepresented all the nobles and free-lances who for the moment could be\r\ngathered together.[526]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: _Journal du siege_, pp. 10, 12. _Cronique Martiniane_,\r\np. 8. _Le jouvencel_, p. 277. Loiseleur, _Comptes des depenses_, pp.\r\n90, 91.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of its chief, Salisbury's army was paralysed by\r\ndisunion and diminished by desertions. Winter was coming: the\r\ncaptains, seeing there was nothing to be done for the present, broke\r\nup their camp, and, with such men as remained to them, went off to\r\nshelter behind the walls of Meung and Jargeau.[527] On the evening of\r\nthe 8th of November all that remained before the city was the garrison\r\nof Les Tourelles, consisting of five hundred Norman horse, commanded\r\nby William Molyns and William Glasdale. The French might besiege and\r\ntake them: they would not budge. The Governor, the old Sire de\r\nGaucourt, had just fallen on the pavement in La Rue des Hotelleries\r\nand broken his arm; he couldn't move.[528] But what about the rest of\r\nthe defenders?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: _Journal du siege_, pp. 12, 13.

Jean de Bueil, _Le\r\njouvencel_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: _Journal du siege_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, no one knew what to do. These warriors were doubtless\r\nacquainted with many measures for the succour of a besieged town, but\r\nthey were all measures of surprise.[529] Their only devices were\r\nsallies, ambuscades, skirmishes, and other such valiant feats of\r\narms. Should they fail in raising a siege by surprise, then they\r\nremained inactive,--at the end of their ideas and of their resources.\r\nTheir most experienced captains were incapable of any common\r\neffort,--of any concerted action, of any enterprise in short,\r\nrequiring a continuous mental effort and the subordination of all to\r\none. Each was for his own hand and thought of nothing but booty. The\r\ndefence of Orleans was altogether beyond their intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: _Le jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 142.]\r\n\r\nFor twenty-one days Captain Glasdale remained entrenched, with his\r\nfive hundred Norman horse, under the battered walls of Les Tourelles,\r\nbetween his earthworks on Le Portereau side, which couldn't have\r\nbecome very formidable as yet, and his barrier on the bridge, which\r\nbeing but wood, a spark could easily have set on fire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the citizens were at work. After the departure of the\r\nEnglish they performed a huge and arduous task. Concluding, and\r\nrightly, that the enemy would return not through La Sologne this time,\r\nbut through La Beauce, they destroyed all their suburbs on the west,\r\nnorth, and east, as they had already destroyed or begun to destroy Le\r\nPortereau. They burned and pulled down twenty-two churches and\r\nmonasteries, among others the church of Saint-Aignan and its\r\nmonastery, so beautiful that it was a pity to see it spoiled, the\r\nchurch of Saint Euverte, the church of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils, not\r\nwithout promising the blessed patrons of the town that when they\r\nshould have delivered the city from the English, the citizens would\r\nbuild them new and more beautiful churches.[530]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: _Journal du siege_, p. 19. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 270. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 61. Le P. Denifle, _La\r\ndesolation des eglises de France_, petition C.]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November Captain Glasdale beheld Sir John Talbot\r\napproaching Les Tourelles. He brought three hundred men furnished with\r\ncannon, mortars, and other engines of war. Thenceforward the\r\nbombardment was resumed more violently than before: roofs were broken\r\nthrough, walls were battered, but there was more noise than work. In\r\nLa Rue Aux-Petits-Souliers a cannon-ball fell on to a table, round\r\nwhich five persons were dining, and no one was hurt. It was thought to\r\nhave been a miracle of Our Lord worked at the intercession of Saint\r\nAignan, the patron saint of the city.[531] The people of Orleans had\r\nwherewith to answer the besiegers. For the seventy cannon and mortars,\r\nof which the city artillery consisted, there were twelve professional\r\ngunners with servants to wait on them. A very clever founder named\r\nGuillaume Duisy had cast a mortar which from its position at the crook\r\nor spur by the Chesneau postern, hurled stone bullets of one hundred\r\nand twenty _livres_ on to Les Tourelles. Near this mortar were two\r\ncannon, one called Montargis because the town of Montargis had lent\r\nit, the other named _Rifflart_[532] after a very popular demon. A\r\nculverin firer, a Lorrainer living at Angers, had been sent by the\r\nKing to Orleans, where he was paid twelve _livres_[533] a month. His\r\nname was Jean de Montesclere. He was held to be the best master of his\r\ntrade. He had in his charge a huge culverin which inflicted great\r\ndamage on the English.[534]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: _Journal du siege_, pp. 16, 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: _Ibid._, p. 17. J.L.

When a cannon-ball happened to fall\r\nnear him he would tumble to the ground and be carried into the town to\r\nthe great joy of the English who believed him dead. But their joy was\r\nshort-lived, for Maitre Jean soon returned to his post and bombarded\r\nthem as before.[535] These culverins were loaded with leaden bullets\r\nby means of an iron ramrod. They were tiny cannon or rather large guns\r\non gun-carriages. They could be moved easily.[536] And so Maitre\r\nJean's culverin was brought wherever it was needed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: _Journal du siege_, p. 28. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol.\r\ni, p. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: Loiseleur, _Comptes_, p. 114. P. Mantellier, _Histoire\r\ndu siege_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of December a truce was proclaimed for the celebration of\r\nthe Nativity of Our Lord. Of one faith and one religion, on feast days\r\nthe hostility of the combatants ceased, and courtesy reconciled the\r\nknights of the two camps whenever the calendar reminded them that they\r\nwere Christians. Noel is a gay feast. Captain Glasdale wanted to\r\ncelebrate it with carol singing according to the English custom. He\r\nasked my Lord Jean, the Bastard of Orleans, and Marshal de Boussac to\r\nsend him a band of musicians, which they graciously did. The Orleans\r\nplayers went forth to Les Tourelles with their clarions and their\r\ntrumpets; and they played the English such carols as rejoiced their\r\nhearts. To the folk of Orleans, who came on to the bridge to listen to\r\nthe music, it sounded very melodious; but no sooner had the truce\r\nexpired than every man looked to himself. For from one bank to the\r\nother the cannon burst from their slumber, hurling balls of stone and\r\ncopper with renewed vigour.[537]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: _Journal du siege_, pp. 15, 18.]\r\n\r\nThat which the people of Orleans had foreseen happened on the 30th of\r\nDecember. On that day the English came in great force through La\r\nBeauce to Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils.[538] All the French knights went\r\nout to meet them and performed great feats of arms; but the English\r\noccupied Saint-Laurent, and then the siege really began. They erected\r\na bastion on the left bank of the Loire, west of Le Portereau, in a\r\nplace called the Field of Saint-Prive. Another they erected in the\r\nlittle island to the right of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils.[539] On the\r\nright bank, at Saint-Laurent, they constructed an entrenched camp. At\r\na bow-shot's distance on the road to Blois, in a place called la\r\nCroix-Boissee, they built another bastion. Two bow-shots away, towards\r\nthe north on the road to Mans, at a spot called Les Douze-Pierres,\r\nthey raised a fort which they called London.[540]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: To the number of 2500. _Journal du siege_, p. 20.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 265.

Girault's report in the _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 283.\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 16, note 5; vol. iv, supplement xiii.]\r\n\r\nBy these works half of Orleans was invested, which was as good as\r\nsaying that it was not invested at all. People went in and out as they\r\npleased. Small relieving companies despatched by the King arrived\r\nwithout let or hindrance. On the 5th of January, 1429, Admiral de\r\nCulant with five hundred men-at-arms crosses the Loire opposite\r\nSaint-Loup and enters the city by the Burgundian Gate. On the 8th of\r\nFebruary there enters William Stuart, brother of the Constable of\r\nScotland, at the head of a thousand combatants well accoutred, and\r\naccompanied by several knights and squires. On the morrow they are\r\nfollowed by three hundred and twenty soldiers. Victuals and ammunition\r\nare constantly arriving; on the 3rd of January, nine hundred and\r\nfifty-four pigs and four hundred sheep; on the 10th, powder and\r\nvictuals; on the 12th, six hundred pigs; on the 24th, six hundred head\r\nof fat cattle and two hundred pigs; on the 31st, eight horses loaded\r\nwith oil and fat.[541]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: _Journal du siege_, pp. 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 34.]\r\n\r\nIt became evident to Lord Scales, William Pole, and Sir John Talbot,\r\nwho since Salisbury's[542] death had been conducting the siege, that\r\nmonths and months must elapse ere the investment could be completed\r\nand the city surrounded by a ring of forts connected by a moat.\r\nMeanwhile the miserable _Godons_, up to the ears in mud and snow, were\r\nfreezing in their wretched hovels,--mere shelters of wood and earth.\r\nIf things went on thus they were in danger of being worse off and more\r\nstarved than the besieged. Therefore, following the example of the\r\nlate Earl, from time to time they tried to bring matters to a crisis;\r\nwithout great hope of success they endeavoured to take the town by\r\nassault.[543]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: Boucher de Molandon and A. de Beaucorps, _L'armee\r\nanglaise vaincue par Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 3 _et seq._ Jarry, _Le compte\r\nde l'armee anglaise_, proofs and illustrations v, p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: Jan. 1, 2. _Journal du siege_, pp. 21, 22, 30.]\r\n\r\nOn the side of the Renard Gate the wall was lower than elsewhere; and,\r\nas their strongest force lay in this direction, they preferred to\r\nattack this part of the ramparts. They stormed the Renard Gate,\r\nrushing against the barriers with loud cries of Saint George; but the\r\nking's men and the city bands drove them back to their bastions.[544]\r\nEach of these ill planned and useless assaults cost them many men. And\r\nthey already lacked both soldiers and horses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: 4-27 Jan. _Journal du siege_, pp. 21, 22, 30.]\r\n\r\nNeither had they succeeded in alarming the people of Orleans by their\r\ndouble bombardment on the south and on the west. There was a joke in\r\nthe town that a great cannon-ball had fallen near La Porte Banniere\r\ninto the midst of a crowd of a hundred people without touching one,\r\nexcept a fellow who had his shoe taken off by it, but suffered no\r\nfurther hurt than having to put it on again.[545]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: 17 Jan. _Ibid._, p. 26.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French, English, and Burgundian knights took delight in\r\nperforming valiant deeds of prowess. Whenever the whim took them, and\r\nunder the slightest protest, they sallied forth into the country, but\r\nalways with the object of capturing some booty, for they thought of\r\nlittle else. One day, for instance, towards the end of January, when\r\nit was bitterly cold, a little band of English marauders entered the\r\nvineyards of Saint-Ladre and Saint-Jean-de-la-Ruelle to gather sticks\r\nfor firewood. The watchman no sooner announces them than behold all\r\nthe banners flying to the wind. Marshal de Boussac, Messire Jacques de\r\nChabannes, Seneschal of Bourbonnais, Messire Denis de Chailly, and\r\nmany another baron, and with them captains and free-lances, make forth\r\ninto the fields. Not one of them can have commanded as many as twenty\r\nmen.[546]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: _Ibid._, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe King's council was making every effort to succour Orleans. The\r\nKing summoned the nobles of Auvergne. They had been true to the Lilies\r\never since the day when the Dauphin, Canon of Notre-Dame-d'Ancis, and\r\nbarely more than a child, had travelled over wild peaks to subdue two\r\nor three rebellious barons.[547] At the royal call the nobles of\r\nAuvergne came forth from their mountains. Beneath the standard of the\r\nCount of Clermont, in the early days of February, they reached Blois,\r\nwhere they joined the Scottish force of John Stuart of Darnley, the\r\nConstable of Scotland, and a company from Bourbonnais, under the\r\ncommand of the barons La Tour-d'Auvergne and De Thouars.[548]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. ii, p. 732.

Loiseleur, _Comptes des\r\ndepenses de Charles VII pour secourir Orleans_, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nJust at this time tidings were received of a convoy of victuals and\r\nammunition which Sir John Fastolf was bringing from Paris to the\r\nEnglish at Orleans. With two hundred men-at-arms the Bastard started\r\nfrom Orleans to concert measures with the Count of Clermont. It was\r\ndecided to attack the convoy. Commanded by the Count of Clermont and\r\nthe Bastard the whole army from Blois marched towards Etampes with the\r\nobject of encountering Sir John Fastolf.[549]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: _Journal du siege_, p. 37.]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February there sallied forth from Orleans fifteen\r\nhundred fighting men commanded by Messire Guillaume d'Albret, Sir\r\nWilliam Stuart, brother of the Constable of Scotland, the Marshal de\r\nBoussac, the Lord of Gravelle, the two Captains Saintrailles, Captain\r\nLa Hire, the Lord of Verduzan, and sundry other knights and squires.\r\nThey were summoned by the Bastard and ordered to join the Count of\r\nClermont's army on the road to Etampes, at the village of\r\nRouvray-Saint-Denis, near Angerville.[550]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 231. _Chronique\r\nde la Pucelle_, pp. 266, 267. _Journal du siege_, pp. 37, 38.]\r\n\r\nThe next day, Saturday, the eve of the first Sunday in Lent, when the\r\nCount of Clermont's army was still some distance away, they reached\r\nRouvray. There, early in the morning, the Gascons of Poton and La Hire\r\nperceived the head of the convoy advancing into the plain, along the\r\nEtampes road.\r\n\r\nThere they were, a line of three hundred carts and wagons full of arms\r\nand victuals conducted by English soldiers and merchants and peasants\r\nfrom Normandy, Picardy, and Paris, fifteen hundred men at the most,\r\nall tranquil and unsuspecting. There naturally occurred to the Gascons\r\nthe idea of falling upon these people and making short work with them\r\nat the moment when they least expected it.[551] In great haste they\r\nsent to the Count of Clermont for permission to attack. As handsome as\r\nAbsalom and Paris of Troy, full of words and eaten up of vanity, the\r\nCount of Clermont, who was but a lad and none of the wisest, had that\r\nvery day received his spurs and was at his first engagement.[552] He\r\nfoolishly sent word to the Gascons not to attack before his arrival.\r\nThe Gascons obeyed greatly disappointed; they saw what was being lost\r\nby waiting. And at length, perceiving that they have walked into the\r\nlion's mouth, the English leaders, Sir John Fastolf, Sir Richard\r\nGethyn, Bailie of Evreux, Sir Simon Morhier, Provost of Paris, place\r\nthemselves in good battle array. With their wagons they make a long\r\nnarrow enclosure in the plain. There they entrench their horsemen,\r\nposting the archers in front, behind stakes planted in the ground with\r\ntheir points inclined towards the enemy.[553] Seeing these\r\npreparations, the Constable of Scotland loses patience and leads his\r\nfour hundred horsemen in a rush upon the stakes, where the horses'\r\nlegs are broken.[554] The English, discovering that it is only a small\r\ncompany they have to deal with, bring out their cavalry and charge\r\nwith such force that they overthrow the French and slay three hundred.\r\nMeanwhile the men of Auvergne had reached Rouvray and were scouring\r\nthe village, draining the cellars. The Bastard left them and came to\r\nthe help of the Scots with four hundred fighting men. But he was\r\nwounded in the foot, and in great danger of being taken.[555]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: _Journal du siege_, pp. 38, 39. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, pp. 267, 268. _Mistere du siege_, line 8867.

La\r\nHire and Poton, beholding the enemy's standards dispersed over the\r\nplain, gathered together as many men as they could, between sixty and\r\neighty, and threw themselves on a small part of the English force,\r\nwhich they overcame. If at this juncture the rest of the French had\r\nrallied they might have saved the honour and advantage of the\r\nday.[557] But the Count of Clermont, who had not attempted to come to\r\nthe aid of the Bastard and the Constable of Scotland, displayed his\r\nunfailing cowardice to the end. Having seen them all slain, he\r\nreturned with his army to Orleans, where he arrived well on into the\r\nnight of the 12th of February.[558] There followed him with their\r\ntroops in disorder, the Baron La Tour-d'Auvergne, the Viscount of\r\nThouars, the Marshal de Boussac, the Lord of Gravelle and the Bastard,\r\nwho with the greatest difficulty kept in the saddle. Jamet du Tillay,\r\nLa Hire, and Poton came last, watching to see that the English did not\r\ncomplete their discomfiture by falling upon them from the forts.[559]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: _Journal du siege_, p. 43. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 269.

To honour\r\nthe French for having discomfited so many natives of Dieppe the\r\ndelighted English merrily named the combat the Battle of the\r\nHerrings.[560]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 230-233.\r\nMonstrelet, vol. iv, p. 313.

Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p. 37.]\r\n\r\nAlbeit the Count of Clermont was the King's cousin, the people of\r\nOrleans received him but coldly. He was held to have acted shamefully\r\nand treacherously; and there were those who let him know what they\r\nthought. On the morrow he made off with his men of Auvergne and\r\nBourbonnais amidst the rejoicings of the townsfolk who did not want to\r\nsupport those who would not fight.[561] At the same time there left\r\nthe city Sire Louis de Culant, High Admiral of France and Captain La\r\nHire, with two thousand men-at-arms. At their departure there arose\r\nfrom the citizens such howls of displeasure, that to appease them it\r\nwas necessary to explain that the captains were going to fetch fresh\r\nsupplies of men and victuals, which was the actual truth. My Lord\r\nRegnault de Chartres, the date of whose arrival at Orleans is\r\nuncertain, departed with them; but he could not be reproached for\r\ngoing, since as Chancellor of France his place was in the King's\r\nCouncil. But what must indeed have appeared strange was that my Lord\r\nSaint-Michel, the successor of Saint-Euverte and Saint-Aignan, should\r\nquit his episcopal see and desert his afflicted spouse.[562] When the\r\nrats go the vessel is on the point of sinking. Only the Lord Bastard\r\nand the Marshal de Boussac were left in the city. And even the Marshal\r\nwas not to stay long. A month later he went, saying that the King had\r\nneed of him and that he must go and take possession of broad lands\r\nfallen to him through his wife, by the death of his brother-in-law,\r\nthe Lord of Chateaubrun, at the Battle of the Herrings.[563] The\r\ntownsfolk deemed the reason a good one. He promised to return before\r\nlong, and they were content. Now the Marshal de Boussac was one of the\r\nbarons who had the welfare of the kingdom most at heart.[564] But he\r\nwho has lands must needs do his duty by them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: 18 Feb. _Journal du siege_, pp. 50, 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: _Ibid._, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: 16 March. _Ibid._, p. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: Thaumas de la Thaumassiere, _Histoire du Berry_,\r\nBourges, 1689, in fol., pp. 648-656.]\r\n\r\nBelieving that they were betrayed and abandoned, the citizens\r\nbethought them of securing their own safety. Since the King was not\r\nable to protect them, they resolved that in order to escape from the\r\nEnglish, they would give themselves to one more powerful than he.\r\nTherefore, to Lord Philip, Duke of Burgundy, they despatched Captain\r\nPoton of Saintrailles, who was known to him because he had been his\r\nprisoner, and two magistrates of the city, Jean de Saint-Avy and Guion\r\ndu Fosse. Their mission was to pray and entreat the Duke to look\r\nfavourably on the town, and for the sake of his good kinsman, their\r\nLord, Charles, Duke of Orleans, a prisoner in England, and thus\r\nprevented from defending his own domain, to induce the English to\r\nraise the siege until such time as the troubles of the realm should be\r\nset at rest.[565] Thus they were offering to place their town as a\r\npledge in the hands of the Duke of Burgundy. Such an offer was in\r\naccordance with the secret desire of the Duke, who, having sent a few\r\nhundred Burgundian horse to the walls of Orleans, was helping the\r\nEnglish, and did not intend to do it for nothing.[566]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: _Journal du siege_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 317. _Journal du siege_, p. 52.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 269.

Du Tillet,\r\n_Recueil des traites_, p. 221.]\r\n\r\nPending the uncertain and distant day when they might be thus\r\nprotected, the people of Orleans continued to protect themselves as\r\nbest they could. But they were anxious and not without reason. For\r\nalthough they might prevent the enemy from entering within the city,\r\nthey could devise no means for speedily driving him away. In the early\r\ndays of March they observed with concern that the English were digging\r\na ditch to serve them as cover in passing from one bastion to another,\r\nfrom la Croix-Boissee to Saint-Ladre. This work they attempted to\r\ndestroy. They vigorously attacked the _Godons_ and took a few\r\nprisoners. With two shots from his culverin Maitre Jean killed five\r\npersons, including Lord Gray, the nephew of the late Earl of\r\nSalisbury.[567] But they could not hinder the English from completing\r\ntheir work. The siege continued with terrible vigour. Agitated by\r\ndoubts and fears, consumed with anxiety, without sleep, without rest,\r\nand succeeding in nothing, they began to despair. Suddenly a strange\r\nrumour arises, spreads, and gains credence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: 3 March. _Journal du siege_, p. 54.]\r\n\r\nIt is told that there had lately passed through the town of Gien a\r\nmaid (_une pucelle_), who proclaimed that she was on her way to Chinon\r\nto the gentle Dauphin, and said that she had been sent by God to raise\r\nthe siege of Orleans and take the King to his anointing at Reims.[568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 21, 23. _Journal du siege_, pp.\r\n46 _et seq._ _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 278.]\r\n\r\nIn colloquial language, a maid (_une pucelle_) was a girl of humble\r\nbirth, who earned her livelihood by manual work and was generally a\r\nservant. Thus the leaden pumps used in kitchens were usually called\r\n_pucelles_. The term was doubtless vulgar, but it had no evil meaning.\r\nIn spite of Clopinel's naughty saying: \"_Je legue ma pucelle a mon\r\ncure_,\" it was used to describe a respectable girl of good\r\nmorals.[569]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: La Curne, under the word _Pucelle_; Du Cange, ad. v.\r\n_Pucella_.\r\n\r\n    _Je laisse cent sols de deniers\r\n    A ceulx qui boivent voluntiers\r\n    Et s'ay laissie a mon cure\r\n    Ma pucelle quand je mourrai,_\r\n\r\nsays Eustache Deschamps (quoted by La Curne); Du Cange cites a will of\r\n1274: \"afterwards I leave to Laurence _ma pucelle_ and twelve _livres_\r\nof Paris.\"]\r\n\r\nThe tidings that a little saint of lowly origin, one of Our Lord's\r\npoor, was bringing divine help to Orleans made a great impression on\r\nminds excited by the fevers of the siege and rendered religious\r\nthrough fear. The Maid inspired them with a burning curiosity, which\r\nthe Lord Bastard, like a wise man, deemed it prudent to encourage. He\r\ndespatched to Chinon two knights charged to inquire concerning the\r\ndamsel. One was Sire Archambaud of Villars, Governor of Montargis,\r\nwhom the Bastard had already sent to the King during the siege; he was\r\nan aged knight, once the intimate friend of Duke Louis of Orleans, and\r\none of the seven Frenchmen who fought against the seven Englishmen at\r\nMontendre,[570] in 1402: an Orleans citizen of the early days,\r\nnotwithstanding his great age he had vigourously defended Les\r\nTourelles on the 21st of October. The other, Messire Jamet du Tillay,\r\na Breton squire, had recently won great honour by covering the retreat\r\nof Rouvray with his men. They set forth and the whole town anxiously\r\nawaited their return.[571]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: _Relation contemporaine du combat de Montendre_, in\r\n_Bulletin de la Societe de l'Histoire de France_, 1834, pp. 109-113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 3, 125, 215. _Journal du siege_,\r\npp. 5, 6, 31, 44. _Nouvelle biographie generale_, articles by Vallet\r\nde Viriville.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT CHINON--PROPHECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the village of Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois, Jeanne dictated a\r\nletter to the King, for she did not know how to write. In this letter\r\nshe asked permission to come to him, and told him that to bring him\r\naid she had travelled over one hundred and fifty leagues, and that she\r\nknew of many things for his good. She was said to have added that were\r\nhe hidden amidst many others she would recognise him;[572] but later,\r\nwhen she was questioned on this matter, she replied that she had no\r\nrecollection of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 56, 75.]\r\n\r\nTowards noon, when the letter had been sealed, Jeanne and her escort\r\nset out for Chinon.[573] She went to the King, just as in those days\r\nthere went to him the sons of poor widows of Azincourt and Verneuil\r\nriding lame horses found in some meadow,--fifteen-year-old lads coming\r\nforth from their ruined towers to mend their own fortunes and those of\r\nFrance; just as Loyalty, Desire, and Famine went to him.[574] Charles\r\nVII was France, the image and symbol of France. Yet he was but a poor\r\ncreature withal, the eleventh of the miserable children born to the\r\nmad Charles VI and his prolific Bavarian Queen.[575] He had grown up\r\namong disasters, and had survived his four elder brethren. But he\r\nhimself was badly bred, knock-kneed, and bandy-legged;[576] a\r\nveritable king's son, if his looks only were considered, and yet it\r\nwas impossible to swear to his descent.[577] Through his presence on\r\nthe bridge at Montereau on that day, when, according to a wise man, it\r\nwere better to have died than to have been there,[578] he had grown\r\npale and trembling, looking dully at everything going to wrack and\r\nruin around him. After their victory of Verneuil and their partial\r\nconquest of Maine, the English had left him four years' respite. But\r\nhis friends, his defenders, his deliverers had alike been terrible.\r\nPious and humble, well content with his plain wife, he led a sad,\r\nanxious life in his chateaux on the Loire. He was timid. And well\r\nmight he be so, for no sooner did he show friendship towards or\r\nconfidence in one of the nobility than that noble was killed. The\r\nConstable de Richemont and the Sire de la Tremouille had drowned the\r\nLord de Giac after a mock trial.[579] The Marshal de Boussac, by\r\norder of the Constable, had slain Lecamus de Beaulieu with even less\r\nceremony. Lecamus was riding his mule in a meadow on the bank of the\r\nClain, when he was set upon, thrown down, his head split open, and his\r\nhand cut off. The favourite's mule was taken back to the King.[580]\r\nThe Constable de Richemont had given Charles in his stead La\r\nTremouille, a very barrel of a man, a toper, a kind of Gargantua who\r\ndevoured the country. La Tremouille having driven away Richemont, the\r\nKing kept La Tremouille until the Constable, of whom he was greatly in\r\ndread, should return. And indeed so meek and fearful a prince had\r\nreason to dread this Breton, always defeated, always furious, bitter,\r\nferocious, whose awkwardness and violence created an impression of\r\nrude frankness.[581]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: _Ibid._, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: Bueil, _Le jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 32, and Tringant, xv;\r\nJean Chartier, _Chronique_, ch. cxxxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: Vallet de Viriville, _Isabeau de Baviere_, 1859, in\r\n8vo, and _Notes sur l'etat civil des princes et princesses nes\r\nd'Isabeau de Baviere_ in the _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_,\r\nvol. xix, pp. 473-482.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: Th.

The\r\nCounts of Clermont and of Pardiac united to aid him. The King's\r\nmother-in-law, Yolande of Aragon, the kingdomless Queen of Sicily and\r\nJerusalem, and the Duchess of Anjou, took the part of the discontented\r\nbarons.[582] The Count of Clermont took prisoner the Chancellor of\r\nFrance, the first minister of the crown, and held him to ransom. The\r\nKing had to pay for the restoration of his Chancellor.[583] In Poitou\r\nthe Constable was warring against the King's men, while the provinces\r\nwhich remained loyal were being wasted by free lances in the King's\r\npay, while the English were advancing towards the Loire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: De Beaucourt, _op. cit._, vol. ii, pp. 143, 144 _et\r\nseq._ E.

Yet he was\r\nas good as another; and perhaps at that time he was just the king that\r\nwas needed. A Philippe of Valois or a Jean le Bon would have amused\r\nhimself by losing his provinces at the point of the sword. Poor King\r\nCharles had neither their means nor their desire to perform deeds of\r\nprowess, or to press to the front of the battle by riding down the\r\ncommon herd. He had one good point: he did not love feats of prowess\r\nand it was impossible for him to be one of those chivalrous knights\r\nwho make war for the love of it. His grandfather before him, who had\r\nbeen equally lacking in chivalrous graces, had greatly damaged the\r\nEnglish. The grandson had not Charles V's wisdom, but he also was not\r\nfree from guile and was inclined to believe that more may be gained by\r\nthe signing of a treaty than at the point of the lance.[584]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: P. de Fenin, _Memoires_, p. 222. De Beaucourt,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, Introduction. E. Charles, _Le caractere de\r\nCharles VII_, in _Revue contemporaine_, vol. xxii, pp. 300-328.]\r\n\r\nConcerning his poverty ridiculous stories were in circulation. It was\r\nsaid that a shoemaker, to whom he could not pay ready money, had torn\r\nfrom his leg the new gaiter he had just put on, and gone off, leaving\r\nthe King with his old ones.[585] It was related how one day La Hire\r\nand Saintrailles, coming to see him, had found him dining with the\r\nQueen, with two chickens and a sheep's tail as their only\r\nentertainment.[586] But these were merely good stories. The King still\r\npossessed domains wide and rich; Auvergne, Lyonnais, Dauphine,\r\nTouraine, Anjou, all the provinces south of the Loire, except Guyenne\r\nand Gascony.[587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: Le doyen de Saint-Thibaud, _Tableau des rois de\r\nFrance_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: Martial d'Auvergne, _Les vigiles de Charles VII_, ed.\r\nCoustelier, 1724 (2 vols. in 12mo), vol. i, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: L. Drapeyron, _Jeanne d'Arc et Philippe le Bon_, in\r\n_Revue de geographie_, November, 1886, p. 331.]\r\n\r\nHis great resource was to convoke the States General. The nobility\r\ngave nothing, alleging that it was beneath their dignity to pay money.\r\nWhen, notwithstanding their poverty, the clergy did contribute\r\nsomething, it was still, always the third estate that bore more than\r\nits share of the financial burden. That extraordinary tax, the\r\n_taille_,[588] became annual. The King summoned the Estates every\r\nyear, sometimes twice a year. They met not without difficulty.[589]\r\nThe roads were dangerous. At every corner travellers might be robbed\r\nor murdered. The officers, who journeyed from town to town collecting\r\nthe taxes, had an armed escort for fear of the Scots and other\r\nmen-at-arms in the King's service.[590]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: _Taille_, so called from a notched stick (Eng. tally),\r\nused by the tax-collector, the number of notches indicating the amount\r\nof the tax due. There were two _tailles_: _la taille seigneuriale_, a\r\ncontribution paid by serfs to their lord; and _la taille royale_, paid\r\nby the third estate to the King. The latter was first levied by\r\nPhilippe le Bel (1285-1314), but was only an occasional tax until the\r\nreign of Charles VII, who converted it into a regular impost. But\r\nalthough collected at stated intervals its amount varied from reign to\r\nreign, becoming intolerably burdensome under the spendthrift kings,\r\nwhile wise rulers, like Henri IV, considerably reduced it. It was not\r\nabolished until the Revolution (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: _Recueil des ordonnances_, vol. xiii, p. xcix, and the\r\nindex of this volume under the word _Impots_.

Thus the representatives of the towns\r\nwere in no hurry to present themselves at the meeting of the Estates.\r\nIt might have been different had they believed that their money would\r\nbe employed for the good of the realm. But they knew that the King\r\nwould first use it to make gifts to his barons. The deputies were\r\ninvited to come and devise means for the repression of the pillage and\r\nplunder from which they were suffering;[591] and, when at the risk of\r\ntheir lives they did come to the royal presence, they were forced to\r\nconsent to the _taille_ in silence. The King's officers threatened to\r\nhave them drowned if they opened their mouths. At the meeting of the\r\nEstates held at Mehun-sur-Yevre in 1425 the men from the good towns\r\nsaid they would be glad to help the King, but first they desired that\r\nan end be put to pillage, and my Lord Bishop of Poitiers, Hugues de\r\nComberel, said likewise. On hearing his words the Sire de Giac said to\r\nthe King: \"If my advice were taken, Comberel would be thrown into the\r\nriver with the others of his opinion.\" Whereupon the men from the good\r\ntowns voted two hundred and sixty thousand livres.[592] In September,\r\n1427, assembled at Chinon, they granted five hundred thousand livres\r\nfor the war.[593] By writs issued on the 8th of January, 1428, the\r\nKing summoned the States General to meet six months hence, on the\r\nfollowing 18th of July, at Tours.[594] On the 18th of July no one\r\nattended. On the 22nd of July came a new summons from the King,\r\ncommanding the Estates to meet at Tours on the 10th of September.[595]\r\nBut the meeting did not take place until October, at Chinon, just when\r\nthe Earl of Salisbury was marching on the Loire. The States granted\r\nfive hundred thousand livres.[596]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: _Le jouvencel_, vol. i, Introduction, pp. xix, xx.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 237.

In those days of war and pillage many a field was\r\nlying fallow, many a shop was closed, and few were the merchants\r\nambling on their nags from town to town.[597]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: Th.

To extricate himself from this embarrassment he employed\r\nthree devices, of which the best was useless. First, as he owed every\r\none money,--the Queen of Sicily,[598] La Tremouille,[599] his\r\nChancellor,[600] his butcher,[601] the chapter of Bourges, which\r\nprovided him with fresh fish,[602] his cooks,[603] his footmen,[604]--he\r\nmade over the proceeds of the tax to his creditors.[605] Secondly, he\r\nalienated the royal domain: his towns and his lands belonged to every\r\none save himself.[606] Thirdly, he coined false money. It was not with\r\nevil intent, but through necessity, and the practice was quite\r\nusual.[607]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: Dom Morice, _Preuves de l'histoire de Bretagne_, vol.\r\nii, cols. 1145, 1194. _Ordonnances_, vol. xv, p. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i,\r\np. 373.

His debtors were the King and a multitude of nobles high and\r\nlow.[608] He was therefore a powerful personage. In those difficult\r\ndays he rendered the crown services self-interested, but none the less\r\nvaluable. From January to August, 1428, he advanced sums amounting to\r\nabout twenty-seven thousand livres for which he received lands and\r\ncastles as security.[609] Fortunately the Royal Council included a\r\nnumber of Jurists and Churchmen who were good business men. One of\r\nthem, an Angevin, Robert Le Macon, Lord of Treves, of plebeian birth,\r\nhad entered the Council during the Regency. He was the first among\r\nthose of lowly origin who served Charles VII so ably that he came to\r\nbe called The Well Served (_Le Bien Servi_).[610] Another, the Sire de\r\nGaucourt, had aided his King in war.[611]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: Clairambault, _Titres, Scelles_, vol. 205, pp. 8769,\r\n8771, 8773, _passim_.

This is\r\nRegnault de Chartres, whom we have already seen promoted to be\r\nminister of finance.[612] Son of Hector de Chartres, master of Woods\r\nand Waters in Normandy, he took orders, became archdeacon of Beauvais,\r\nthen chamberlain of Pope John XXIII, and in 1414, at about\r\nthirty-four, was raised to the archiepiscopal see of Reims.[613] The\r\nfollowing year three of his brothers fell on the gory field of\r\nAzincourt. In 1418 Hector de Chartres perished at Paris, assassinated\r\nby the Butchers.[614] Regnault himself, cast into prison by the\r\nCabochiens, expected to be put to death. He vowed that if he escaped\r\nhe would fast every Wednesday, and drink water for breakfast every\r\nFriday and Saturday, for the rest of his life.[615] One must not judge\r\na man by an act prompted by fear. Nevertheless we may well hesitate to\r\nrank the author of this vow with those Epicureans who did not believe\r\nin God, of whom there were said to be many among the clerks. We may\r\nconclude rather that his intelligence submitted to the common beliefs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: Le P.

Like the Sire de la Tremouille he lent money to\r\nthe King.[621] But in those days who did not lend the King money?\r\nCharles VII gave him the town and castle of Vierzon in payment of a\r\ndebt of sixteen thousand _livres tournois_.[622] When La Tremouille\r\nhad treated the Constable as the Constable had treated Louvet,\r\nRegnault de Chartres became Chancellor again. He entered into his\r\noffice on the 8th of November, 1428. By this time the Council had sent\r\nmen-at-arms and cannon to Orleans. No sooner was my Lord of Reims\r\nappointed than he threw himself into the city and spared no\r\ntrouble.[623] He was keenly attached to the goods of this world and\r\nmight pass for a miser.[624] But there can be no doubt of his devotion\r\nto the royal cause, nor of his hatred of those who fought under the\r\nLeopard and the Red Cross.[625]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p.\r\n632.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: Le P.

Duchesne, _Histoire des chanceliers et garde des\r\nsceaux de France_, p. 487.]\r\n\r\nAfter eleven days' journey, Jeanne reached Chinon on the 6th of\r\nMarch.[626] It was the fourth Sunday in Lent, that very Sunday on\r\nwhich the lads and lasses of Domremy went forth in bands, into the\r\ncountry still grey and leafless, to eat their nuts and hard-boiled\r\neggs, with the rolls their mothers had kneaded. That was what they\r\ncalled their well-dressing. But Jeanne was not to recollect past\r\nwell-dressings nor the home she had left without a word of\r\nfarewell.[627] Ignoring those rustic, well-nigh pagan festivals which\r\npoor Christians introduced into the penance of the holy forty days,\r\nthe Church had named this Sunday _Laetare_ Sunday, from the first word\r\nin the introit for the day: _Laetare, Jerusalem_. On that Sunday the\r\npriest, ascending the altar steps, says low mass; and at high mass the\r\nchoir sings the following words from Scripture: \"_Laetare, Jerusalem;\r\net conventum facite, omnes qui diligitis eam ..._: Rejoice ye with\r\nJerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy\r\nwith her all ye that mourn for her: That ye may suck, and be satisfied\r\nwith the breasts of her consolations; ...\"[628] That day priests,\r\nmonks, and clerks versed in holy Scripture, as in the churches with\r\nthe people assembled they sang _Laetare, Jerusalem_, had present before\r\ntheir minds the virgin announced by prophecy, raised up for the\r\ndeliverance of the kingdom, marked with a sign, who was then making\r\nher humble entrance into the town. Perhaps more than one applied what\r\nthat passage of Scripture says of the Holy Nation to the realm of\r\nFrance, and in the coincidence of that liturgical text and the happy\r\ncoming of the Maid found occasion for hope. _Laetare, Jerusalem!_\r\nRejoice ye, O people, in your true King and your rightful sovereign.\r\n_Et conventum facite_: and come together. Unite all your strength\r\nagainst the enemy. _Gaudete cum laetitia, qui in tristitia fuistis_:\r\nafter your long mourning, rejoice. The Lord sends you succour and\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 394, 462.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: Isaiah, ch. 66, verse 10 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nBy the intercession of Saint Julien, and probably with the aid of\r\nCollet de Vienne, the King's messenger, Jeanne found a lodging in the\r\ntown, near the castle, in an inn kept by a woman of good repute.[629]\r\nThe spits were idle. And the guests, deep in the chimney-corner, were\r\nwatching the grilling of Saint Herring, who was suffering worse\r\ntorments than Saint Lawrence.[630] In those times no one in\r\nChristendom neglected the Church's injunctions concerning the fasts\r\nand abstinences of Holy Lent. Following the example of Our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist who fasted forty days in the desert, the faithful observed the\r\nfast from Quadragesima Sunday until Easter Sunday, making forty days\r\nafter abstracting the Sundays when the fast was broken but not the\r\nabstinence. Thus fasting and with her soul comforted, Jeanne listened\r\nto the soft whisper of her Voices.[631] The two days she spent in the\r\ninn were passed in retirement, on her knees.[632] The banks of the\r\nVienne and the broad meadows, still in their black wintry garb, the\r\nhill-slopes over which light mists floated, did not tempt her. But\r\nwhen, on her way to church, climbing up a steep street, or merely\r\ngrooming her horse in the inn yard, she raised her eyes to the north,\r\nthere on a mountain close at hand, just about the distance that would\r\nbe traversed by one of those stone cannon-balls which had been in use\r\nfor the last fifty or sixty years, she saw the towers of the finest\r\ncastle of the realm. Behind its proud walls there breathed that King\r\nto whom she had journeyed, impelled by a miraculous love.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: _La vie de saint Harenc glorieux martir et comment il\r\nfut pesche en la mer et porte a Dieppe_, in _Recueil des poesies\r\nfrancaises des XV'e et XVI'e siecles_, by A. de Montaiglon, vol.\r\nii, pp. 325-332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: Still if Jeanne were the age she is said to have been,\r\nabout eighteen, she was under no obligation to fast, but only to be\r\nabstinent. Nevertheless, when imprisoned at Rouen, she fasted during\r\nLent; but we do not know how old her judges considered her to be.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 143.]\r\n\r\nThere were three castles merging before her into one long mass of\r\nembattled walls, of keeps, towers, turrets, curtains, barbicans,\r\nramparts, and watch-towers; three castles separated one from the other\r\nby dykes, barriers, posterns, and portcullis. On her left, towards\r\nsunset, crowded, one behind the other, the eight towers of Coudray,\r\none of which had been built for a king of England, while the newest\r\nwere more than two hundred years old. On the right could be plainly\r\nseen the middle castle, with its ancient walls and its towers crowned\r\nwith machicolated battlements. There was the chamber of Saint Louis,\r\nthe King's chamber, the apartment of him whom Jeanne called the Gentle\r\nDauphin. And there also, close to the rush-strewn room, was the great\r\nhall in which she was to be received. Towards the town the site of the\r\nhall was indicated by an adjoining tower, square and very old. On the\r\nright extended a vast bailey or stronghold, intended as a lodging for\r\nthe garrison, and a defence of the middle part of the castle. Near by\r\na large chapel raised its roof, in the form of an inverted keel, above\r\nthe ramparts. This chapel, built by Henry II of England, was under the\r\npatronage of Saint George, and from it the bailey received its name of\r\nFort Saint George.[633] In those days every one knew the story of\r\nSaint George the valiant knight, who with his lance transfixed a\r\ndragon and delivered a King's daughter, and then suffered martyrdom\r\nconfessing his faith. Like Saint Catherine he had been bound to a\r\nwheel with sharp spikes, and the wheel had been miraculously broken\r\nlike that on which the executioners had bound the Virgin of\r\nAlexandria. And like her Saint George had suffered death by means of\r\nan axe, thus proving that he was a great saint.[634] In one thing,\r\nhowever, he was wrong; he was of the party of the _Godons_, who for\r\nmore than three hundred years had kept his feast as that of all the\r\nEnglish. They held him to be their patron saint and invoked him before\r\nall other saints. Thus his name was pronounced as constantly by the\r\nvilest Welsh archer as by a knight of the Garter. In truth no one\r\nknew what he thought and whether he did not condemn all these\r\nmarauders who were fighting for a bad cause; but there was reason to\r\nfear that such great honours would affect him. The saints of Paradise\r\nare generally ready to take the side of those who invoke them most\r\ndevoutly. And Saint George, after all, was just as English as Saint\r\nMichael was French. That glorious archangel had appeared as the most\r\nvigilant protector of the Lilies ever since my Lord Saint Denys, the\r\npatron saint of the kingdom, had permitted his abbey to be taken. And\r\nJeanne knew it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: G. de Cougny, _Notice archeologique et historique sur\r\nle chateau de Chinon_, Chinon, 1860, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: _La legende doree_, translated by Gustave Brunet, 1846,\r\npp. 259, 264. Douhet, _Dictionnaire des legendes_, pp. 426, 436.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the despatches brought from the Commander of Vaucouleurs by\r\nColet de Vienne were presented to the King.[635] These despatches\r\ninstructed him concerning the deeds and sayings of the damsel. This\r\nwas one of those countless matters to be examined by the Council, one\r\nwhich, it appears, the King must himself investigate, as pertaining to\r\nhis royal office and as interesting him especially, since it might be\r\na question of a damsel of remarkable piety, and he was himself the\r\nhighest ecclesiastical personage in France.[636] His grandfather, wise\r\nprince that he was, would have been far from scorning the counsel of\r\ndevout women in whom was the voice of God. About the year 1380 he had\r\nsummoned to Paris Guillemette de la Rochelle, who led a solitary and\r\ncontemplative life, and acquired such great power therefrom, so it was\r\nsaid, that during her transports she raised herself more than two feet\r\nfrom the ground. In many a church King Charles V had beautiful\r\noratories built, where she might pray for him.[637] The grandson\r\nshould do no less, for his need was still greater. There were still\r\nmore recent examples in his family of dealings between kings and\r\nsaints. His father, the poor King Charles VI, when he was passing\r\nthrough Tours, had caused Louis, Duke of Orleans, to present to him\r\nDame Marie de Maille. She had taken a vow of virginity and had\r\ntransformed the spouse, who approached her like a devouring lion, into\r\na timorous lamb. She revealed secrets to the King, and he was pleased\r\nwith her, for three years later he wanted to see her again at Paris.\r\nThis time they talked long together in private, and she revealed more\r\nsecrets to the King, so that he sent her away with gifts.[638] This\r\nsame Prince had granted an audience to a poor knight of Caux, one\r\nRobert le Mennot, to whom, when he was in danger of shipwreck near the\r\ncoast of Syria, had been vouchsafed a vision. He proclaimed that God\r\nhad sent him to restore peace.[639] Still more favourably had the King\r\nreceived a woman, Marie Robine, who was commonly called la Gasque of\r\nAvignon.[640] In 1429, there were those at court who remembered the\r\nprophetess sent to Charles VI to confirm him in his subjection to Pope\r\nBenedict XIII. This pope was held to be an antipope; nevertheless, La\r\nGasque was regarded as a prophetess. Like Jeanne she had had many\r\nvisions concerning the desolation of the realm of France; and she had\r\nseen weapons in the sky.[641] The kings of England were no less ready\r\nthan the kings of France to heed the words of those saintly men and\r\nwomen, multitudes of whom were at that time uttering prophecies. Henry\r\nV consulted the hermit of Sainte-Claude, Jean de Gand, who foretold\r\nthe King's approaching death; and on his death-bed he again had the\r\nstern prophet summoned.[642] It was the custom of saints to speak to\r\nkings and of kings to listen to them. How could a pious prince disdain\r\nso miraculous a source of counsel? Had he done so he would have\r\nincurred the censure of the wisest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 273. _Journal du siege_,\r\npp. 46, 47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: _Epitre de Jouvenel des Ursins_, in De Beaucourt,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_ vol. v, p. 206, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, p. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: _Acta sanctorum_, vol. iii, March, p. 742.

Of her mission and her miracles\r\nthey could say nothing. But they spoke of the good they had seen in\r\nher during the journey, and affirmed that there was no evil in\r\nher.[643]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 273. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 46.]\r\n\r\nOf a truth, God speaketh through the mouths of virgins. But in such\r\nmatters it is necessary to act with extreme caution, to distinguish\r\ncarefully between the true prophetesses and the false, not to take for\r\nmessengers from heaven the heralds of the devil. The latter sometimes\r\ncreate illusions. Following the example of Simon the Magician, who\r\nworked wonders vying with the miracles of St. Peter, these creatures\r\nhave recourse to diabolical arts for the seduction of men. Twelve\r\nyears before, there had prophesied a woman, likewise from the\r\nLorraine Marches, Catherine Suave, a native of Thons near Neufchateau,\r\nwho lived as a recluse at Port de Lates, yet most certainly did the\r\nBishop of Maguelonne know her to be a liar and a sorceress, wherefore\r\nshe was burned alive at Montpellier in 1417.[644] Multitudes of women,\r\nor rather of females, _mulierculae_,[645] lived like this Catherine and\r\nended like her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: _Parvus Thalamus_, ed.

At first she replied that she would say\r\nnothing save to the King. But when the clerks represented to her that\r\nthey were questioning her in the King's name, she told them that the\r\nKing of Heaven had bidden her do two things: one was to raise the\r\nsiege of Orleans, the other to lead the King to Reims for his\r\nanointing and his coronation.[646] Just as at Vaucouleurs before Sire\r\nRobert, so before these Churchmen she repeated very much what the\r\nvavasour of Champagne had said formerly, when he had been sent to Jean\r\nle Bon, as she was now sent to the Dauphin Charles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 646: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 22. These facts were known at\r\nLyons on the 22nd of April, 1429. (Clerk of the Chambre des Comptes of\r\nBrabant, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 426.)]\r\n\r\nHaving journeyed as far as the Plain of Beauce, where King John,\r\nimpatient for battle, was encamped with his army, the vavasour of\r\nChampagne entered the camp and asked to see the wisest and best of the\r\nKing's liegemen at court. The nobles, to whom this request was\r\ncarried, began to laugh. But one among them, who had with his own eyes\r\nseen the vavasour, recognised at once that he was a good, simple man\r\nand without guile. He said to him: \"If thou hast any advice to give,\r\ngo to the King's chaplain.\" The vavasour therefore went to King John's\r\nchaplain and said to him: \"Obtain for me an audience of the King; I\r\nhave something to tell that I will say to no one but to him.\" \"What is\r\nit?\" asked the chaplain. \"Tell me what is in your heart.\" But the good\r\nman would not reveal his secret. The chaplain went to King John and\r\nsaid to him: \"Sire, there is a worthy man here who seems to me wise in\r\nhis way. He desires to say to you something that he will tell to you\r\nalone.\" King John refused to see the good man. He summoned his\r\nconfessor, and, accompanied by the chaplain, sent him to learn the\r\nvavasour's secret. The two priests went to the man and told him that\r\nthe King had appointed them to hear him. At this announcement,\r\ndespairing of ever seeing King John, and trusting to the Confessor and\r\nthe chaplain not to reveal his secret to any but the King, he uttered\r\nthese words: \"While I was alone in the fields, a voice spake unto me\r\nthree times, saying: 'Go unto King John of France and warn him that he\r\nfight not with any of his enemies.' Obedient to that voice am I come\r\nto bring the tidings to King John.\" Having heard the vavasour's secret\r\nthe confessor and the chaplain took him to the King, who laughed at\r\nhim. With his comrades-in-arms he advanced to Poitiers, where he met\r\nthe Black Prince. He lost his whole army in battle, and, twice wounded\r\nin the face, was taken prisoner by the English.[647]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 647: S. Luce, _Chronique des quatre premiers Valois_, Paris,\r\n1861, in 8vo, pp. 46, 48.]\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastics, who had examined Jeanne, held various opinions\r\nconcerning her. Some declared that her mission was a hoax, and that\r\nthe King ought to beware of her.[648] Others on the contrary held\r\nthat, since she said she was sent of God, and that she had something\r\nto tell the King, the King should at least hear her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 648: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 115.

When he was nearly sixty, Gelu had\r\nwithdrawn from the Council, and exchanged the archiepiscopal see of\r\nTours for the bishopric of Embrun, which was less exalted and more\r\nretired. He was illustrious and venerable.[649] Jean Girard and Pierre\r\nl'Hermite informed him of the coming of the damsel in a letter,\r\nwherein they told him also that, having been questioned in turn by\r\nthree professors of theology, she had been found devout, sober,\r\ntemperate, and in the habit of participating once a week in the\r\nsacraments of confession and communion. Jean Girard thought she might\r\nhave been sent by the God who raised up Judith and Deborah, and who\r\nspoke through the mouths of the Sibyls.[650]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. iii, col. 1089.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: Le R.P.

Daily he\r\nconfessed, and communicated on every feast day.[651] But he believed\r\nin foretelling events by means of the stars, in which he did not\r\ndiffer from other princes of his time. Each one of them had an\r\nastrologer in his service.[652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: The Monk of Dunfermline, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n340.

De Beaucourt, _Histoire\r\nde Charles VII_, vol. vi, p. 399.]\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Burgundy had been constantly accompanied by a Jewish\r\nsoothsayer, Maitre Mousque. On that day, the end of which he was never\r\nto see, as he was going to the Bridge of Montereau, Maitre Mousque\r\ncounselled him not to advance any further, prophesying that he would\r\nnot return. The Duke continued on his way and was killed.[653] The\r\nDauphin Charles confided in Jean des Builhons, in Germain de\r\nThibonville and in all others of the peaked cap.[654]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: Chastellain, vol. iii, p. 446.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i,\r\np. 173.]\r\n\r\nHe always had two or three astrologers at court. These almanac makers\r\ndrew up schemes of nativity, cast horoscopes and read in the sky the\r\napproach of wars and revolutions. One of them, Maitre Rolland the\r\nScrivener, a fellow of the University of Paris, was one night, at a\r\ncertain hour, observing the heavens from his roof, when he saw the\r\napex of Virgo in the ascendant, Venus, Mercury, and the sun half way\r\nup the sky.[655] This his colleague, Guillaume Barbin of Geneva,\r\ninterpreted to mean that the English would be driven from France and\r\nthe King restored by the hand of a mere maid.[656] If we may believe\r\nthe Inquisitor Brehal, some time before Jeanne's coming into France, a\r\nclever astronomer of Seville, Jean de Montalcin by name, had written\r\nto the King among other things the following words: \"By a virgin's\r\ncounsel thou shalt be victorious. Continue in triumph to the gates of\r\nParis.\"[657]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: I here correct the text of Simon de Phares (_Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, p. 536) according to the written opinion of M. Camille\r\nFlammarion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 536.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 341.]\r\n\r\nAt that very time the Dauphin Charles had with him at Chinon an old\r\nNorman astrologer, one Pierre, who may have been Pierre de\r\nSaint-Valerien, canon of Paris. The latter had recently returned from\r\nScotland, whither, accompanied by certain nobles, he had gone to fetch\r\nthe Lady Margaret, betrothed to the Dauphin Louis. Not long afterwards\r\nthis Maitre Pierre was, rightly or wrongly, believed to have read in\r\nthe sky that the shepherdess from the Meuse valley was appointed to\r\ndrive out the English.[658]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: Recueil de Simon de Phares, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n32, note.]\r\n\r\nJeanne had not long to wait in her inn. Two days after her arrival,\r\nwhat she had so ardently desired came to pass: she was taken to the\r\nKing.[659] In the last century near the Grand-Carroy, opposite a\r\nwooden-fronted house, there was shown a well on the edge of which,\r\naccording to tradition, Jeanne set foot when she alighted from her\r\nhorse, before climbing the steep ascent leading to the Castle.\r\nThrough La Vieille Porte,[660] she was already crossing the moat when\r\nthe King was still hesitating as to whether he would receive her. Many\r\nof his familiar advisers, and those not the least important,\r\ncounselled him to beware of a strange woman whose designs might be\r\nevil. There were others who put it before him that this shepherdess\r\nwas introduced by letters from Robert de Baudricourt carried through\r\nhostile provinces; that in journeying to the King she had forded many\r\nrivers in a manner almost miraculous. On these considerations the King\r\nconsented to receive her.[661]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: The kerb was removed during the Second Empire.

Th. Basin,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII et de Louis XI_, vol. i, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nThe great hall was crowded. As at every audience given by the King the\r\nroom was close with the breath of the assembled multitude. The vast\r\nchamber presented that aspect of a market-house or of a rout which was\r\nso familiar to courtiers. It was evening; fifty torches flamed beneath\r\nthe painted beams of the roof.[662] Men of middle age in robes and\r\nfurs, young, smooth-faced nobles, thin and narrow shouldered, of\r\nslender build, their lean legs in tight hose, their feet in long,\r\npointed shoes; barons fully armed to the number of three hundred,\r\naccording to Aulic custom, pushed, crowded and elbowed each other\r\nwhile the usher was here and there striking the courtiers on the head\r\nwith his rod.[663]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 75, 141.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: Le Curial, in _Les oeuvres de Maistre Alain\r\nChartier_, ed. Du Chesne, Paris, 1642, in 4to, p. 398.]\r\n\r\nBesides the two ambassadors from Orleans, Messire Jamet du Tillay and\r\nthe old baron Archambaud de Villars, governor of Montargis, there were\r\npresent Simon Charles, Master of Requests, as well as certain great\r\nnobles, the Count of Clermont, the Sire de Gaucourt, and probably the\r\nSire de La Tremouille and my Lord the Archbishop of Reims, Chancellor\r\nof the kingdom.[664] On hearing of Jeanne's approach, King Charles\r\nburied himself among his retainers, either because he was still\r\nmistrustful and hesitating, or because he had other persons to speak\r\nto, or for some other reason.[665] Jeanne was presented by the Count\r\nof Vendome.[666] Robust, with a firm, short neck, her figure appeared\r\nfull, although confined by her man's jerkin. She wore breeches like a\r\nman,[667] but still more surprising than her hose was her head-gear\r\nand the cut of her hair. Beneath a woollen hood, her dark hair hung\r\ncut round in soup-plate fashion like a page's.[668] Women of all ranks\r\nand all ages were careful to hide their hair so that not one lock of\r\nit should escape from beneath the coif, the veil, or the high\r\nhead-dress which was then the mode. Jeanne's flowing locks looked\r\nstrange to the folk of those days.[669] She went straight to the\r\nKing, took off her cap, curtsied, and said: \"God send you long life,\r\ngentle Dauphin.\"[670]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: According to Jeanne there were present La Tremoille and\r\nthe Archbishop of Reims, but she also mentions the Duke of Alencon,\r\nwho was certainly not there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: _Ibid._, pp. 102-103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: _Ibid._, p. 219. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, p. 205.

It is possible that on that day he may have been poorly attired.\r\nWe know that it was his custom to have new sleeves put to his old\r\ndoublets.[671] And in any case he did not show off his clothes. Very\r\nugly, knock-kneed, with emaciated thighs, small, odd, blinking eyes,\r\nand a large bulbous nose, on his bony, bandy legs tottered and\r\ntrembled this prince of twenty-six.[672]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 671: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p.\r\n195.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 672: Th.

De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nThat Jeanne should have seen his picture already and recognised him by\r\nit is hardly likely. Portraits of princes were rare in those days.\r\nJeanne had never handled one of those precious books in which King\r\nCharles may have been painted in miniature as one of the Magi offering\r\ngifts to the Child Jesus.[673] It was not likely that she had ever\r\nseen one of those figures painted on wood in the semblance of her\r\nKing, with hands clasped, beneath the curtains of his oratory.[674]\r\nAnd if by chance some one had shown her one of these portraits her\r\nuntrained eyes could have discerned but little therein. Neither need\r\nwe inquire whether the people of Chinon had described to her the\r\ncostume the King usually wore and the shape of his hat: for like every\r\none else he kept his hat on indoors even at dinner. What is most\r\nprobable is that those who were kindly disposed towards her pointed\r\nout the King. At any rate he was not difficult to distinguish, since\r\nthose who saw her go up to him were in no wise astonished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 673: As in the miniature painted by Jean Fouquet, more than\r\nten years later. Gruyer, _Les Quarante Fouquet de Chantilly_, Paris,\r\n1897, in 4to.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 674: _Note sur un ancien portrait de Charles VII, conserve\r\nau Louvre_, in the _Bulletin de la Societe des Antiquaires de France_,\r\n1862, pp. 67 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nWhen she had made her rustic curtsey, the King asked her name and what\r\nshe wanted. She replied: \"Fair Dauphin, my name is Jeanne the Maid;\r\nand the King of Heaven speaks unto you by me and says that you shall\r\nbe anointed and crowned at Reims, and be lieutenant of the King of\r\nHeaven, who is King of France.\" She asked to be set about her work,\r\npromising to raise the siege of Orleans.[675]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 103. _Relation du greffier de La\r\nRochelle_, p. 337. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 273. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 67, 68.]\r\n\r\nThe King took her apart and questioned her for some time. By nature he\r\nwas gentle, kind to the poor and lowly, but not devoid of mistrust and\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nIt is said that during this private conversation, addressing him with\r\nthe familiarity of an angel, she made him this strange announcement:\r\n\"My Lord bids me say unto thee that thou art indeed the heir of France\r\nand the son of a King; he has sent me to thee to lead thee to Reims to\r\nbe crowned there and anointed if thou wilt.\"[676] Afterwards the\r\nMaid's chaplain reported these words, saying he had received them\r\nfrom the Maid herself. All that is certain is that the Armagnacs were\r\nnot slow to turn them into a miracle in favour of the Line of the\r\nLilies. It was asserted that these words spoken by God himself, by the\r\nmouth of an innocent girl, were a reply to the carking, secret anxiety\r\nof the King. Madame Ysabeau's son, it was said, distracted and\r\nsaddened by the thought that perhaps the royal blood did not flow in\r\nhis veins, was ready to renounce his kingdom and declare himself a\r\nusurper, unless by some heavenly light his doubts concerning his birth\r\nshould be dispelled.[677] Men told how his face shone with joy[678]\r\nwhen it was revealed to him that he was the true heir of France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 103 (evidence of Brother\r\nPasquerel).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: The Abridger of the _Trial_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp.\r\n258, 259. Basin, _Histoire de Charles VII et de Louis XI_, vol. i, p.\r\n67. _Journal du siege_, p. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 116 (evidence of S. Charles). S.\r\nLuce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. lxi.]\r\n\r\nDoubtless the Armagnac preachers were in the habit of speaking of\r\nQueen Ysabeau as \"_une grande gorre_\" and a Herodias of\r\nlicentiousness; but one would like to know whence her son derived his\r\ncurious misgiving. He had not manifested it on entering into his\r\ninheritance; and, had occasion required, the jurists of his party\r\nwould have proved to him by reasons derived from laws and customs that\r\nhe was by birth the true heir and the lawful successor of the late\r\nKing; for filiation must be proved not by what is hidden, but by what\r\nis manifest, otherwise it would be impossible to assign the legal heir\r\nto a kingdom or to an acre of land. Nevertheless it must be borne in\r\nmind that the King was very unfortunate at this time. Now misfortune\r\nagitates the conscience and raises scruples; and he might well doubt\r\nthe justice of his cause since God was forsaking him. But if he were\r\nindeed assailed by painful doubts, how can he have been relieved from\r\nthem by the words of a damsel who, as far as he then knew, might be\r\nmad or sent to him by his enemies? It is hard to reconcile such\r\ncredulity with what we know of his suspicious nature. The first\r\nthought that occurred to him must have been that ecclesiastics had\r\ninstructed the damsel.\r\n\r\nA few moments after he had dismissed her, he assembled the Sire de\r\nGaucourt and certain other members of his Council and repeated to them\r\nwhat he had just heard: \"She told me that God had sent her to aid me\r\nto recover my kingdom.\"[679] He did not add that she had revealed to\r\nhim a secret known to himself alone.[680]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 17, 209. As early as April the\r\npromised deliverance of Orleans and coronation at Reims had been heard\r\nof at Lyons (_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 426).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: Pasquerel alone of the witnesses mentions this\r\n(_Trial_, vol. iii, p. 103). Cf. the anecdote of the Sire de Boissy\r\nrelated by P. Sala in his collection, _Les hardiesses des grands rois\r\net empereurs_ (_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 278).]\r\n\r\nThe King's Counsellors, knowing little of the damsel, decided that\r\nthey must have her before them to examine her concerning her life and\r\nher belief.[681]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nThe Sire de Gaucourt took her from the inn and lodged her in a tower\r\nof that Castle of Coudray, which for the last three days she had seen\r\ndominating the town.[682] One of the three castles, Le Coudray was\r\nonly separated from the middle chateau in which the King dwelt by a\r\nmoat and fortifications.[683] The Sire de Gaucourt confided her to\r\nthe care of the lieutenant of the Town of Chinon, Guillaume Bellier,\r\nthe King's Major Domo.[684] He gave her for her servant one of his own\r\npages, a child of fifteen, Immerguet, sometimes called Minguet, and\r\nsometimes Mugot. His real name was Louis de Coutes, and he came of an\r\nold warrior family which had been in the service of the house of\r\nOrleans for a century. His father, Jean, called Minguet, Lord of\r\nFresnay-le-Gelmert, of la Gadeliere and of Mitry, Chamberlain to the\r\nDuke of Orleans, had died in great poverty the year before. He had\r\nleft a widow and five children, three boys and two girls, one of whom,\r\nJeanne by name, had since 1421 been the wife of Messire Florentin\r\nd'Illiers, Governor of Chateaudun. Thus the little page, Louis de\r\nCoutes, and his mother, Catherine le Mercier, Dame de Noviant, who\r\ncame of a noble Scottish family, were both in a state of penury,\r\nalbeit the Duke of Orleans in acknowledgment of his Chamberlain's\r\nfaithful services had from his purse granted aid to the Lady of\r\nNoviant.[685] Jeanne kept Minguet with her all day, but at night she\r\nslept with the women.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: _Ibid._, p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: G. de Cougny, _Charles VII et Jeanne d'Arc a Chinon_,\r\nTours, 1877, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: _Ibid._, pp. 65, 73.

She prayed and often wept many tears.[687] For\r\nseveral days persons of high estate came to speak with her. They found\r\nher dressed as a boy.[688]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 687: _Ibid._, p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 688: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 274 _et seq._ Jean\r\nChartier, _Chronique_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nSince she had been with the King, divers persons asked her whether\r\nthere were not in her country a wood called \"Le Bois-Chenu.\"[689] This\r\nquestion was put to her because a prophecy of Merlin concerning a maid\r\nwho should come from \"Le Bois-Chenu\" was then in circulation. And folk\r\nwere impressed by it; for in those days every one gave heed to\r\nprophecies and especially to those of Merlin the Magician.[690]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 133, 340.

To the science of numbers, which is the key to\r\nthe future, he added a knowledge of physics, by means of which he\r\nworked his enchantments. Thus it was easy for him to transform rocks\r\ninto giants. And yet he was conquered by a woman; the fairy Vivien\r\nenchanted the enchanter and kept him in a hawthorn bush under a spell.\r\nThis is only one of many examples of the power of women.\r\n\r\nFamous doctors and illustrious masters held that Merlin had laid bare\r\nmany future events and prophesied many things which had not yet\r\nhappened. To such as were amazed that the son of the Devil should have\r\nreceived the gift of prophecy they replied that the Holy Ghost is able\r\nto reveal his secrets to whomsoever he pleases, for had he not caused\r\nthe Sibyls to speak, and opened the mouth of Balaam's ass?\r\n\r\nMerlin had seen in a vision Sire Bertrand du Guesclin in the guise of\r\na warrior bearing an eagle on his shield. This was remembered after\r\nthe Constable had wrought his great deeds.[691]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: Cuvelier, _Le poeme de Du Guesclin_, l. 3285.\r\nFrancisque-Michel and Th.

The\r\nexactness with which its prognostications had been fulfilled down to\r\n1135 was marvelled at, and an attempt was made to interpret the\r\nprophecies relating to subsequent times.\" Gaston Paris, _La\r\nlitterature francaise au moyen age_, 1890, pp. 86-104.]\r\n\r\nIn the prophecies of this Wise Man the English believed no less firmly\r\nthan the French. When Arthur of Brittany, Count of Richemont, was\r\ntaken prisoner, held to ransom, and brought before King Henry, the\r\nlatter, when he perceived a boar on the arms of the Duke, broke forth\r\ninto rejoicing; for he called to mind the words of Merlin who had\r\nsaid, \"A Prince of Armorica, called Arthur, with a boar for his crest,\r\nshall conquer England, and when he shall have made an end of the\r\nEnglish folk he shall re-people the land with a Breton race.\"[692]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: Le Baud, _Histoire de Bretagne_, Paris, 1638, in fol.,\r\np. 451.]\r\n\r\nNow during the Lent of 1429 there was circulated among the Armagnacs\r\nthis prophecy, taken from a book of the prophecies of Merlin: \"From\r\nthe town of the Bois-Chenu there shall come forth a maid for the\r\nhealing of the nation. When she hath stormed every citadel, with her\r\nbreath she shall dry up all the springs. Bitter tears shall she shed\r\nand fill the Island with a terrible noise.

The\r\nforest of Denmark shall rise up and with a human voice say: 'Come,\r\nCambria, and take Cornwall unto thyself.'\"[693]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 340-342.]\r\n\r\nIn these mysterious words Merlin dimly foretells that a virgin shall\r\nperform great and wonderful deeds before perishing by the hand of the\r\nenemy. On one point only is he clear, or so it seems; that is, when he\r\nsays that this virgin shall come from the town of the Bois-Chenu.\r\n\r\nIf this prophecy had been traced back to its original source and read\r\nin the fourth book of the _Historia Britonum_, where it is to be found\r\nunder the title of _Guyntonia Vaticinium_, it would have been seen to\r\nrefer to the English city of Winchester, and it would have appeared\r\nthat in the version then in circulation in France, the original\r\nmeaning had been garbled, distorted, and completely metamorphosed. But\r\nno one thought of verifying the text. Books were rare and minds\r\nuncritical. This deliberately falsified prophecy was accepted as the\r\npure word of Merlin and numerous copies of it were spread abroad.\r\n\r\nWhence came these copies? Their origin doubtless will remain a mystery\r\nfor ever; but one point is certain: they referred to La Romee's\r\ndaughter, to the damsel who, from her father's house, could see the\r\nedge of \"Le Bois-Chenu.\" Thus they came from close at hand and were of\r\nrecent circulation.[694] If this amended prophecy of Merlin be not\r\nthe one that reached Jeanne in her village, forecasting that a Maid\r\nshould come from the Lorraine Marches for the saving of the kingdom,\r\nthen it was closely related to it. The two prognostications have a\r\nfamily likeness.[695] They were uttered in the same spirit and with\r\nthe same intention; and they indicate that the ecclesiastics of the\r\nMeuse valley and those of the Loire had agreed to draw attention to\r\nthe inspired damsel of Domremy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: Morosini, vol. iv, p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: Pierre Migiet weaves the two prophecies into one, which\r\nhe says he has read in a book, _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 133.]\r\n\r\nAs Merlin had foretold the works of Jeanne, so Bede must also have\r\npredicted them, for Bede and Merlin were always together in matters of\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nThe Monk of Wearmouth, the Venerable Bede, who had been dead six\r\ncenturies, had been a veritable mine of knowledge in his lifetime. He\r\nhad written on theology and chronology; he had discoursed of night and\r\nday, of weeks and months, of the signs of the zodiac, of epacts, of\r\nthe lunar cycle, and of the movable feasts of the Church. In his book\r\n_De temporum ratione_ he had treated of the seventh and eighth ages of\r\nthe world, which were to follow the age in which he lived. He had\r\nprophesied. During the siege of Orleans, churchmen were circulating\r\nthese obscure lines attributed to him, and foretelling the coming of\r\nthe Maid:\r\n\r\n    _Bis sex cuculli, bis septem se sociabunt,[696]\r\n    Gallorum pulli Tauro nova bella parabunt\r\n    Ecce beant bella, tunc fert vexilla Puella._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: Adopting the emendation made by M. Germain\r\nLefevre-Pontalis in his _Chronique d'Antonio Morosini_, vol. iii, pp.\r\n126, 127; vol. iv, pp. 316 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe first of these lines is a chronogram, that is, it contains a date.\r\nTo decipher it you take the numeral letters of the line and add them\r\ntogether; the total gives the date.\r\n\r\n     bIs seX CVCVLLI, bIs septeM se soCIabVnt.\r\n\r\n     1 + 10 + 100 + 5 + 100 + 5 + 50 + 50 + 1 + 1 + 1000 + 100 +\r\n     1 + 5 = 1429.\r\n\r\nHad any one sought these lines in the works of the Venerable Bede they\r\nwould not have found them, because they are not there; but no one\r\nthought of looking for them any more than they thought of looking for\r\nthe Foret Chenue in Merlin.[697] And it was understood that both Bede\r\nand Merlin had foretold the coming of the Maid. In those days\r\nprophecies, chronograms, and charms flew like pigeons from the banks\r\nof the Loire and spread abroad throughout the realm. Not later than\r\nthe May or June of this year the pseudo Bede will reach Burgundy.\r\nEarlier still he will be heard of in Paris. The aged Christine de\r\nPisan, living in retirement in a French abbey, before the last day of\r\nJuly, 1429, will write that Bede and Merlin had beheld the Maid in a\r\nvision.[698]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: _The Complete Works of the Venerable Bede_, ed. Giles,\r\nLondon, 1843-1844, 12 vols., in 8vo, in _Patres Ecclesiae Anglicanae_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: Christine de Pisan, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 12.\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 126.

They were truly\r\nindefatigable, and by a stroke of good luck we possess a piece of\r\ntheir workmanship which has escaped the ravages of time. It is a short\r\nLatin poem written in the obscure prophetic style, of which the\r\nfollowing is a translation through the old French.\r\n\r\n\"A virgin clothed in man's attire, with the body of a maid, at God's\r\nbehest goes forth to raise the downcast King, who bears the lilies,\r\nand to drive out his accursed enemies, even those who now beleaguer\r\nthe city of Orleans and strike terror into the hearts of its\r\ninhabitants. And if the people will take heart and go out to battle,\r\nthe treacherous English shall be struck down by death, at the hand of\r\nthe God of battles who fights for the Maid, and the French shall cause\r\nthem to fall, and then shall there be an end of the war; and the old\r\ncovenants and the old friendship shall return. Pity and righteousness\r\nshall be restored. There shall be a treaty of peace, and all men shall\r\nof their own accord return to the King, which King shall weigh justice\r\nand administer it unto all men and preserve his subjects in beautiful\r\npeace. Henceforth no English foe with the sign of the leopard shall\r\ndare to call himself King of France [added by the translator] and\r\nadopt the arms of France, which arms are borne by the holy Maid.\"[699]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: Buchon, _Math. d'Escouchy_, etc., p. 537. G.\r\nLefevre-Pontalis, Eberhard Windecke, pp. 21-31. A Latin text of this\r\nprophecy is to be found on the fly-leaf of the Cartulary of\r\nTherouanne.]\r\n\r\nThese false prophecies give some idea of the means employed for the\r\nsetting to work of the inspired damsel. Such methods may be somewhat\r\ntoo crafty for our liking. These clerks had but one object,--the peace\r\nof the realm and of the church. The miraculous deliverance of the\r\npeople had to be prepared. We must not be too hasty to condemn those\r\npious frauds without which the Maid could not have worked her\r\nmiracles. Much art and some guile are necessary to contrive for\r\ninnocence a hearing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on a steep rock, on the bank of the Durance, in the remote\r\nsee of Saint-Marcellin, Jacques Gelu remained faithful to the King he\r\nhad served and careful for the interests of the house of Orleans and\r\nof France. To the two churchmen, Jean Girard and Pierre l'Hermite, he\r\nreplied that, for the sake of the orphan and the oppressed, God would\r\ndoubtless manifest himself, and would frustrate the evil designs of\r\nthe English; yet one should not easily and lightly believe the words\r\nof a peasant girl bred in solitude, for the female sex was frail and\r\neasily deceived, and France must not be made ridiculous in the eyes of\r\nthe foreigner. \"The French,\" he added, \"are already famous for the\r\nease with which they are duped.\" He ended by advising Pierre l'Hermite\r\nthat it would be well for the King to fast and do penance so that\r\nHeaven might enlighten him and preserve him from error.[700]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 393-407; vol. v, p. 473.\r\nMarcellin Fornier, _Histoire des Alpes-Maritimes ou Cottiennes_, vol.\r\nii, pp. 313, 314.]\r\n\r\nBut the mind of the oracle and ex-councillor could not rest. He wrote\r\ndirect to King Charles and Queen Marie to warn them of the danger. To\r\nhim it seemed that there could be no good in the damsel. He mistrusted\r\nher for three reasons: first, because she came from a country in the\r\npossession of the King's enemies, Burgundians and Lorrainers;\r\nsecondly, she was a shepherdess and easily deceived; thirdly, she was\r\na maid. He cited as an example Alexander of Macedon, whom a Queen\r\nendeavoured to poison. She had been fed on venom by the King's enemies\r\nand then sent to him in the hope that he would fall a victim to the\r\nwench's[701] wiles. But Aristotle dismissed the seductress and thus\r\ndelivered his prince from death. The Archbishop of Embrun, as wise as\r\nAristotle, warned the King against conversing with the damsel in\r\nprivate. He advised that she should be kept at a distance and\r\nexamined, but not repulsed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: [In the original French _garce_.] The text has _grace_,\r\nwhich is not possible. I have conjectured that the word should be\r\n_garce_.]\r\n\r\nA prudent answer to those letters reassured Gelu. In a new epistle he\r\ntestified to the King his satisfaction at hearing that the damsel was\r\nregarded with suspicion and left in uncertainty as to whether she\r\nwould or would not be believed. Then, with a return to his former\r\nmisgivings, he added: \"It behoves not that she should have frequent\r\naccess to the King until such time as certainty be established\r\nconcerning her manner of life and her morals.\"[702]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: M. Fornier, _Histoire des Alpes-Maritimes ou\r\nCottiennes_, vol. ii, pp. 313, 314.]\r\n\r\nKing Charles did indeed keep Jeanne in uncertainty as to what was\r\nbelieved of her. But he did not suspect her of craftiness and he\r\nreceived her willingly. She talked to him with the simplest\r\nfamiliarity. She called him gentle Dauphin, and by that term she\r\nimplied nobility and royal magnificence.[703] She also called him her\r\n_oriflamme_, because he was her _oriflamme_, or, as in modern language\r\nshe would have expressed it, her standard.[704] The _oriflamme_ was\r\nthe royal banner. No one at Chinon had seen it, but marvellous things\r\nwere told of it. The _oriflamme_ was in the form of a gonfanon with\r\ntwo wings, made of a costly silk, fine and light, called\r\n_sandal_,[705] and it was edged with tassels of green silk. It had\r\ncome down from heaven; it was the banner of Clovis and of Saint\r\nCharlemagne. When the King went to war it was carried before him. So\r\ngreat was its virtue that the enemy at its approach became powerless\r\nand fled in terror. It was remembered how, when in 1304 Philippe le\r\nBel defeated the Flemings, the knight who bore it was slain. The next\r\nday he was found dead, but still clasping the standard in his\r\narms.[706] It had floated in front of King Charles VI before his\r\nmisfortunes, and since then it had never been unfurled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 703: Clerk of the Town Hall of Albi, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p.\r\n300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: Thomassin, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: _Sandal_ or _cendal_, a silk bearing some resemblance\r\nto taffetas. Cf. Godefroy, _Lexique de l'ancien francais_ (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: Du Cange, _Glossaire_, under the word _auriflamma_. Le\r\nRoux de Lincy and Tisserand, _Paris et ses historiens_, pp. 150, 251,\r\n257, 259. [_Histoire generale de Paris._]]\r\n\r\nOne day when the Maid and the King were talking together, the Duke of\r\nAlencon entered the hall. When he was a child, the English had taken\r\nhim prisoner at Verneuil and kept him five years in the Crotoy\r\nTower.[707] Only recently set at liberty, he had been shooting quails\r\nnear Saint-Florent-les-Saumur, when a messenger had brought the\r\ntidings that God had sent a damsel to the King to turn the English out\r\nof France.[708] This news interested him as much as any one because he\r\nhad married the Duke of Orleans' daughter; and straightway he had come\r\nto Chinon to see for himself. In the days of his graceful youth the\r\nDuke of Alencon appeared to advantage, but he was never renowned for\r\nhis wisdom. He was weak-minded, violent, vain, jealous, and extremely\r\ncredulous. He believed that ladies find favour by means of a certain\r\nherb, the mountain-heath; and later he thought himself bewitched. He\r\nhad a disagreeable, harsh voice; he knew it, and the knowledge annoyed\r\nhim.[709] As soon as she saw him approaching, Jeanne asked who this\r\nnoble was. When the King replied that it was his cousin Alencon, she\r\ncurtsied to the Duke and said: \"Be welcome. The more representatives\r\nof the blood royal are here the better.\"[710] In this she was\r\ncompletely mistaken. The Dauphin smiled bitterly at her words. Not\r\nmuch of the royal blood of France ran in the Duke's veins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: Perceval de Cagny, p. 136. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\npp. 224, 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\niii, pp. 408, 409. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. vi,\r\npp. 43, 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day Jeanne went to the King's mass. When she approached\r\nher Dauphin she bowed before him. The King took her into a room and\r\nsent every one away except the Sire de la Tremouille and the Duke of\r\nAlencon.\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne addressed to him several requests. More especially did she\r\nask him to give his kingdom to the King of Heaven. \"And afterwards,\"\r\nshe added, \"the King of Heaven will do for you what he has done for\r\nyour predecessors and will restore you to the condition of your\r\nfathers.\"[711]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: _Ibid._, pp. 91, 92. Eberhard Windecke, pp. 152 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nIn discoursing thus of things spiritual, in giving utterance to those\r\nprecepts of reformation and of a new life, she was repeating what the\r\nclerks had taught her. Nevertheless she was by no means imbued with\r\nthis doctrine. It was too subtle for her, and it was shortly to fade\r\nfrom her mind and give place to an ardour less monastic but more\r\nchivalrous.\r\n\r\nThat same day she rode out with the King and threw a lance in the\r\nmeadow with so fine a grace that the Duke of Alencon, marvelling, made\r\nher a present of a horse.[712]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nA few days later this young noble took her to the Abbey of\r\nSaint-Florent-les-Saumur,[713] the church of which was so greatly\r\nadmired that it was called La Belle d'Anjou. Here in this abbey there\r\ndwelt at that time his mother and his wife. It is said that they were\r\nglad to see Jeanne. But they had no great faith in the issue of the\r\nwar. The young Dame of Alencon said to her: \"Jeannette, I am full of\r\nfear for my husband. He has just come out of prison, and we have had\r\nto give so much money for his ransom that gladly would I entreat him\r\nto stay at home.\" To which Jeanne replied: \"Madame, have no fear. I\r\nwill bring him back to you in safety, and either such as he is now or\r\nbetter.\"[714]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Perceval de Cagny, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 96.]\r\n\r\nShe called the Duke of Alencon her fair Duke,[715] and loved him for\r\nthe sake of the Duke of Orleans, whose daughter he had married. She\r\nloved him also because he believed in her when all others doubted or\r\ndenied, and because the English had done him wrong. She loved him too\r\nbecause she saw he had a good will to fight. It was told how when he\r\nwas a captive in the hands of the English at Verneuil, and they\r\nproposed to give him back his liberty and his goods if he would join\r\ntheir party, he had rejected their offer.[716] He was young like her;\r\nshe thought that he like her must be sincere and noble. And perhaps in\r\nthose days he was, for doubtless he was not then seeking to discover\r\npowders with which to dry up the King.[717]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: Perceval de Cagny, p. 151, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: Cf. 1 Kings xiii, 4 (W.S.).

Here also\r\nwere gathered together many famous clerks learned in theology, secular\r\nas well as regular,[719] and grave doctors and masters were summoned\r\nto join them. Jeanne set out under escort. At first she thought she\r\nwas being taken to Orleans. Her faith was like that of the ignorant\r\nbut believing folk, who, having taken the cross, went forth and\r\nthought every town they approached was Jerusalem. Half way she\r\ninquired of her guides where they were taking her. When she heard that\r\nit was to Poitiers: \"In God's name!\" she said, \"much ado will be\r\nthere, I know. But my Lord will help me. Now let us go on in God's\r\nstrength!\"[720]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 116, 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: Belisaire Ledain, _Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers_,\r\nSaint-Maixent, 1891, in 8vo, 15 pages.

Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 316.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT POITIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fourteen years the town of Poitiers had been the capital of that\r\npart of France which belonged to the French. The Dauphin Charles had\r\ntransferred his Parlement there, or rather had assembled there those\r\nfew members who had escaped from the Parlement of Paris. The Parlement\r\nof Poitiers consisted of two chambers only. It would have judged as\r\nwisely as King Solomon had there been any questions on which to\r\npronounce judgment, but no litigants presented themselves--they were\r\nafraid of being captured on the way by freebooters and captains in the\r\nKing's pay; besides, in the disturbed state of the kingdom justice had\r\nlittle to do with the settlement of disputes. The councillors, who for\r\nthe most part had lands near Paris, were hard put to it for food and\r\nclothing. They were rarely paid and there were no perquisites. In vain\r\nthey had inscribed their registers with the formula: _Non deliberetur\r\ndonec solvantur species_; no payments were forthcoming from the\r\nsuitors.[721] The Attorney General, Messire Jean Jouvenel des Ursins,\r\nwho owned rich lands and houses in Ile-de-France, Brie, and Champagne,\r\nwas filled with pity at the sight of that good and honourable lady\r\nhis wife, his eleven children, and his three sons-in-law going\r\nbarefoot and poorly clad through the streets of the town.[722] As for\r\nthe doctors and professors who had followed the King's fortunes, in\r\nvain were they wells of knowledge and springs of clerkly learning,\r\nsince, for lack of a University to teach in, they reaped no advantage\r\nfrom their eloquence and their erudition. The town of Poitiers, having\r\nbecome the first city in the realm, had a Parlement but no University,\r\nlike a lady highly born but one-eyed withal, for the Parlement and the\r\nUniversity are the two eyes of a great city. Thus in their doleful\r\nleisure they were consumed with a desire, if it were God's will, to\r\nrestore the King's fortunes as well as their own. Meanwhile, shivering\r\nwith cold and emaciated with hunger, they groaned and lamented. Like\r\nIsrael in the desert they sighed for the day when the Lord, inclining\r\nhis ear to their supplications, should say: \"At even ye shall eat\r\nflesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall\r\nknow that I am the Lord your God.\" _Vespere comedetis carnes et mane\r\nsaturabimini panibus: scietisque quod ego sum Dominus deus vester._\r\n(Exodus xvi, 12.) It was from among these poor and faithful servants\r\nof a poverty-stricken King that were chosen for the most part the\r\ndoctors and clerks charged with the examination of the Maid. They\r\nwere: the Lord Bishop of Poitiers;[723] the Lord Bishop of\r\nMaguelonne;[724] Maitre Jean Lombard, doctor in theology, sometime\r\nprofessor of theology at the University of Paris;[725] Maitre\r\nGuillaume le Maire, bachelor of theology, canon of Poitiers;[726]\r\nMaitre Gerard Machet, the King's Confessor;[727] Maitre Jourdain\r\nMorin;[728] Maitre Jean Erault, professor of theology;[729] Maitre\r\nMathieu Mesnage, bachelor of theology;[730] Maitre Jacques\r\nMeledon;[731] Maitre Jean Macon, a very famous doctor of civil law and\r\nof canon law;[732] Brother Pierre de Versailles, a monk of Saint-Denys\r\nin France, of the order of Saint Benedict, professor of theology,\r\nPrior of the Priory of Saint-Pierre de Chaumont, Abbot of Talmont in\r\nthe diocese of Laon, Ambassador of his most Christian Majesty the King\r\nof France;[733] Brother Pierre Turelure, of the Order of Saint\r\nDominic, Inquisitor at Toulouse;[734] Maitre Simon Bonnet;[735]\r\nBrother Guillaume Aimery, of the Order of Saint-Dominic, doctor and\r\nprofessor of theology;[736] Brother Seguin of Seguin of the Order of\r\nSaint Dominic, doctor and professor of theology;[737] Brother Pierre\r\nSeguin, Carmelite;[738] several of the King's Councillors,\r\nlicentiates of civil as well as of canon law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: Neuville, _Le Parlement royal a Poitiers_, in the\r\n_Revue historique_, vol. vi, p. 18.

But we must remember that in those days theology subtle\r\nand inflexible dominated all human knowledge and forced the secular\r\narm to give effect to its judgment. Therefore, as soon as an ignorant\r\ngirl caused it to be believed that she had seen God, the Virgin, the\r\nsaints, and the angels, she must either pass from miracle to miracle,\r\nthrough an edifying death to beatification, or from heresy to heresy\r\nthrough an ecclesiastical prison, to be burnt as a witch. And, as the\r\nholy inquisitors were fully persuaded that the Devil easily entered\r\ninto a woman, the unhappy creature was more likely to be burnt alive\r\nthan to die in an odour of sanctity. But Jeanne before the doctors at\r\nPoitiers was an exception; she ran no risk of being suspected in\r\nmatters of faith. Even Brother Pierre Turelure himself had no desire\r\nto find in her one of those heretics he zealously sought to discover\r\nat Toulouse. In her presence the illustrious masters drew in their\r\ntheological claws. They were churchmen, but they were Armagnacs, for\r\nthe most part business men, diplomatists, old councillors of the\r\nDauphin.[739] As priests, doubtless they were possessed of a certain\r\nbody of dogma and morality, and of a code of rules for judging matters\r\nof faith. But now it was a question not of curing the disease of\r\nheresy, but of driving out the English. Jeanne was in favour with my\r\nLord the Duke of Alencon and with my Lord the Bastard; the inhabitants\r\nof Orleans were looking to her for their deliverance. She promised to\r\ntake the King to Reims; and it happened that the cleverest and the\r\nmost powerful man in France, the Chancellor of the kingdom, my Lord\r\nRegnault de Chartres, was Archbishop and Count of Reims; and that had\r\ngreat weight.[740]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: O. Raguenet de Saint-Albin, _Les juges de Jeanne d'Arc\r\na Poitiers, membres du Parlement ou gens d'Eglise_, Orleans, 1894, in\r\n8vo, 46 pages.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: See _ante_, pp. 153, 154.]\r\n\r\nIf it should be as she said, if God had verily sent her to the aid of\r\nthe Lilies, to the mind of whomsoever possessed sense and learning it\r\nappeared marvellous but not incredible. No one denied that God could\r\ndirectly intervene in the affairs of kingdoms, for he himself had\r\nsaid: _Per me reges regnant_.\r\n\r\nIn this Church holy and indivisible, there were the doctors of\r\nPoitiers who deliberately pronounced God to be on the side of the\r\nDauphin, while the University of Paris as deliberately pronounced God\r\nto be on the side of the Burgundians and the English. His messenger\r\nneed not necessarily be an angel. He might employ a creature human or\r\nnot human, like the raven that fed Elijah. And that a woman should\r\nengage in war accorded with what was written in books concerning\r\nCamilla, the Amazons, and Queen Penthesilea, and with what the Bible\r\nsays of the strong women, Deborah, Jahel, Judith of Bethulia, raised\r\nup by God for the salvation of Israel. For it is written: \"The mighty\r\none did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of Titans\r\nsmite him, nor high giants set upon him; but Judith the daughter of\r\nMerari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance.\"[741]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741: Judith, xvi, 7 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nJeanne was taken to the mansion where dwelt Maitre Jean Rabateau, not\r\nfar from the law-courts, in the heart of the town.[742] Maitre Jean\r\nRabateau was Lay Attorney General; all criminal cases went to him,\r\nwhile civil cases went to the ecclesiastical Attorney General, Jean\r\nJouvenel. Alike King's advocates, in the King's service, they both\r\nrepresented him in cases wherein he was concerned. The King was an\r\nunprofitable client. For representing him in criminal trials Maitre\r\nJean Rabateau received four hundred livres a year. He was forbidden to\r\nappear in any but crown cases; and no one suspected him of receiving\r\nmany bribes. If in addition he held the office of Councillor to the\r\nDuke of Orleans he gained little by it. Like most Parlement officials\r\nhe was for the moment very poor. A stranger in Poitiers, he had no\r\nhouse there, but lodged in a mansion, which, because it belonged to a\r\nfamily named Rosier, was called the Hotel de la Rose. It was a large\r\ndwelling. Witnesses whom it was necessary to keep securely and deal\r\nwith honourably were entertained there. Jeanne was taken there\r\nalthough the Parlement had nothing to do with her cross-examination.[743]\r\nOnce again she was placed in charge of a man who served both the Duke\r\nof Orleans and the King of France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 19, 74, 82, 203. _Chronique de\r\nla Pucelle_, p. 275. B. Ledain, _Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers_,\r\nSaint-Maixent, 1891, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: Nevertheless see _Le mistere du siege_, pp. 397-406.]\r\n\r\nJean Rabateau's wife, in common with the wives of all lawyers, was a\r\nwoman of good reputation.[744] While she was at La Rose, Jeanne would\r\nstay long on her knees every day after dinner. At night she would\r\nrise from her bed to pray, and pass long hours in the little oratory\r\nof the mansion. It was in this house that the doctors conducted her\r\nexamination. When their coming was announced she was seized with cruel\r\nanxiety. The Blessed Saint Catherine was careful to reassure her.[745]\r\nShe likewise had disputed with doctors and confounded them. True,\r\nthose doctors were heathen, but they were learned and their minds were\r\nsubtle; for in the life of the Saint it is written: \"The Emperor\r\nsummoned fifty doctors versed in the lore of the Egyptians and the\r\nliberal arts. And when she heard that she was to dispute with the wise\r\nmen, Catherine feared lest she should not worthily defend the Gospel\r\nof Jesus Christ. But an angel appeared unto her and said: 'I am the\r\nArchangel Saint Michael, and I am come to tell thee that thou shalt\r\ncome forth from the strife victorious and worthy of Our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, the hope and crown of those who strive for him.' And the\r\nVirgin disputed with the doctors.\"[746]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: There can be no reason for suspecting this lady of not\r\nliving up to her reputation, for nothing is known of her, not even\r\nwhether she were Maitre Jean Rabateau's first or second wife, for he\r\nhad two. The first was the daughter of Benoit Pidelet. Cf. B. Ledain,\r\n_La maison de Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers, Maitre Jean Rabateau_ (_Revue\r\ndu Bas-Poitou_, April, 1891, pp. 48, 66). A. Barbier, _Jeanne d'Arc et\r\nl'hotellerie de la Rose_, Poitiers, 1892, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: Voragine, _La legende doree_ (Vie de Sainte\r\nCatherine).]\r\n\r\nThe grave doctors and masters and the principal clerks of the\r\nParlement of Poitiers, in companies of two and three, repaired to the\r\nhouse of Jean Rabateau, and each one of them in turn questioned\r\nJeanne. The first to come were Jean Lombard, Guillaume le Maire,\r\nGuillaume Aimery, Pierre Turelure, and Jacques Meledon. Brother Jean\r\nLombard asked: \"Wherefore have you come? The King desires to know what\r\nled you to come to him.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne's reply greatly impressed these clerks: \"As I kept my flocks a\r\n_Voice appeared to me_. The Voice said: 'God has great pity on the\r\npeople of France. Jeanne, thou must go into France.' On hearing these\r\nwords I began to weep. Then the Voice said unto me: 'Go to\r\nVaucouleurs. There shalt thou find a captain, who will take thee\r\nsafely into France, to the King. Fear not.' I did as I was bidden, and\r\nI came to the King without hindrance.\"[747]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 204 (evidence of Brother\r\nSeguin).]\r\n\r\nThen the word fell to Brother Guillaume Aimery: \"According to what you\r\nhave said, the Voice told you that God will deliver the people of\r\nFrance from their distress; but if God will deliver them he has no\r\nneed of men-at-arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"In God's name,\" replied the Maid, \"the men-at-arms will fight, and\r\nGod will give the victory.\"\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume declared himself satisfied.[748]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: _Ibid._, pp. 203, 204.]\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of March, Maitre Pierre de Versailles and Maitre Jean\r\nErault went together to Jean Rabateau's lodging. The squire, Gobert\r\nThibault, whom Jeanne had already seen at Chinon, came with them. He\r\nwas a young man and very simple, one who believed without asking for a\r\nsign. As they came in Jeanne went to meet them, and, striking the\r\nsquire on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, she said: \"I wish I had\r\nmany men as willing as you.\"[749]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: _Ibid._, p. 74.]\r\n\r\nWith men-at-arms she felt at her ease. But the doctors she could not\r\ntolerate, and she suffered torture when they came to argue with her.\r\nAlthough these theologians showed her great consideration, their\r\neternal questions wearied her; their slowness and heaviness\r\nexasperated her. She bore them a grudge for not believing in her\r\nstraightway, without proof, and for asking her for a sign, which she\r\ncould not give them, since neither Saint Michael nor Saint Catherine\r\nnor Saint Margaret appeared during the examination. In retirement, in\r\nthe oratory, and in the lonely fields the heavenly visitants came to\r\nher in crowds; angels and saints, descending from heaven, flocked\r\naround her. But when the doctors came, immediately the Jacob's ladder\r\nwas drawn up. Besides, the clerks were theologians, and she was a\r\nsaint. Relations are always strained between the heads of the Church\r\nMilitant and those devout women who communicate directly with the\r\nChurch Triumphant. She realised that the revelations granted to her so\r\nabundantly inspired her most favourable judges with doubts, suspicion,\r\nand even mistrust. She dared not confide to them much of the mystery\r\nof her Voices, and when the Churchmen were not present she told\r\nAlencon, her fair Duke, that she knew more and could do more than she\r\nhad ever told all those clerks.[750] It was not to them she had been\r\nsent; it was not for them that she had come. She felt awkward in their\r\npresence, and their manners were the occasion of that irritation which\r\nis discernible in more than one of her replies.[751] Sometimes when\r\nthey questioned her she retreated to the end of her bench and sulked.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 275.]\r\n\r\n\"We come to you from the King,\" said Maitre Pierre de Versailles.\r\n\r\nShe replied with a bad grace: \"I am quite aware that you are come to\r\nquestion me again. I don't know A from B.\"[752] But to the question:\r\n\"Wherefore do you come?\" she made answer eagerly: \"I come from the\r\nKing of Heaven to raise the siege of Orleans, and take the King to be\r\ncrowned and anointed at Reims. Maitre Jean Erault, have you ink and\r\npaper? Write what I shall tell you.\" And she dictated a brief\r\nmanifesto to the English captains: \"You, Suffort, Clasdas, and La\r\nPoule, in the name of the King of Heaven I call upon you to return to\r\nEngland.\"[753]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 74 (evidence of Gobert\r\nThibault).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 74. Boucher de Molandon and A. de\r\nBeaucorps, _L'armee anglaise_, p. 111. La Poule, as he is called here,\r\nis identical with Suffort, and is none other than William Pole, Earl\r\nof Suffolk, unless John Pole, William's brother, be intended, but he\r\nwas not one of the three organisers of the siege. As for Clasdas or\r\nGlasdale, as the French called him, he served under the orders of the\r\nCommander of Les Tourelles. These errors may have been Jeanne's, or\r\npossibly they were made by the witness. They do not recur in the\r\nletter to the English.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Erault, who wrote at her dictation, was, like most of the\r\nclerks, favourably disposed towards her. Further, he had his own\r\nideas. He recollected that Marie of Avignon, surnamed La Gasque, had\r\nuttered true and memorable prophecies to King Charles VI. Now La\r\nGasque had told the King that the realm was to suffer many sorrows;\r\nand she had seen weapons in the sky. Her story of her vision had\r\nconcluded with these words: \"While I was afeard, believing myself\r\ncalled upon to take these weapons, a voice comforted me, saying: 'They\r\nare not for thee, but for a Virgin, who shall come and with these\r\nweapons deliver the realm of France.'\" Maitre Jean Erault meditated on\r\nthese marvellous revelations and came to believe that Jeanne was the\r\nVirgin announced by Marie of Avignon.[754]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Gerard Machet, the King's Confessor, had found it written that\r\na Maid should come to the help of the King of France. He remarked on\r\nit to Gobert Thibault, the Squire, who was no very great\r\npersonage;[755] and he certainly spoke of it to several others.\r\nGerard Machet, Doctor of Theology, sometime Vice Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, from which he was now excluded, was regarded as one of the\r\nlights of the Church. He loved the court,[756] although he would not\r\nadmit it, and enjoyed the favour of the King, who had just rewarded\r\nhis services by giving him money with which to purchase a mule.[757]\r\nAll doubts concerning the disposition of these doctors are removed by\r\nthe discovery that the King's Confessor himself put into circulation\r\nthose prophecies which had been distorted in favour of the Maid from\r\nthe Bois-Chenu.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: _Ibid._, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: _Lettres de Gerard Machet_, Bibl. nat.

Now it is written: \"The woman\r\nshall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man\r\nput on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the\r\nLord thy God\" (Deuteronomy xxii, 5). The Council of Gangres, held in\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Valens, had anathematised women who dressed\r\nas men and cut short their hair.[759] Many saintly women, impelled by\r\na strange inspiration of the Holy Ghost, had concealed their sex by\r\nmasculine garb. At Saint-Jean-des-Bois, near Compiegne, was preserved\r\nthe reliquary of Saint Euphrosyne of Alexandria, who lived for\r\nthirty-eight years in man's attire in the monastery of the Abbot\r\nTheodosius.[760] For these reasons, and because of these precedents,\r\nthe doctors argued: since Jeanne had put on this clothing not to\r\noffend another's modesty but to preserve her own, we will put no evil\r\ninterpretation on an act performed with good intent, and we will\r\nforbear to condemn a deed justified by purity of motive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 71, 72, 73, 171.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: Labbe, _Sacro-Sancta Consilia_ (1671), vol. ii, pp.\r\n413, 434.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 760: Surius, _Vitae S.S._ (1618), vol. i, pp. 21-24. Gabriel\r\nBrosse, _Histoire abregee de la vie et de la translation de Sainte\r\nEuphrosine, Vierge d'Alexandrie, patronne de l'abbaye de\r\nBeaulieu-les-Compiegne_, Paris, 1649, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nCertain of her questioners inquired why she called Charles Dauphin\r\ninstead of giving him his title of King. This title had been his by\r\nright since the 30th of October, 1422; for on that day, the ninth\r\nsince the death of the King his father, at Mehun-sur-Yevre, in the\r\nchapel royal, he had put off his black gown and assumed the purple\r\nrobe, while the heralds, raising aloft the banner of France, cried:\r\n\"Long live the King!\"\r\n\r\nShe answered: \"I will not call him King until he shall have been\r\nanointed and crowned at Reims. To that city I intend to take\r\nhim.\"[761]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 761: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nWithout this anointing there was no king of France for her. Of the\r\nmiracles which had followed that anointing she had heard every year\r\nfrom the mouth of her priest as he recited the glorious deeds of the\r\nBlessed Saint Remi, the patron saint of her parish. This reply was\r\nsuch as to satisfy the interrogators because, both for things\r\nspiritual and temporal, it was important that the King should be\r\nanointed at Reims.[762] And Messire Regnault de Chartres must have\r\nardently desired it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 762: It may be noticed that during the consultation of the\r\ndoctors, according to the report of it given by Thomassin in _Le\r\nregistre Delphinal_, Charles of Valois is designated alike by the\r\ntitle of King and by that of Dauphin (_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 303).]\r\n\r\nContradicted by the clerks, she opposed the Church's doctrine by the\r\ninspiration of her own heart, and said to them: \"There is more in the\r\nBook of Our Lord than in all yours.\"[763]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 763: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThis was a bold and biting reply, which would have been dangerous had\r\nthe theologians been less favourably inclined to her. Otherwise they\r\nmight have held it to be trespassing on the rights of the Church, who,\r\nas the guardian of the Holy Books, is their jealous interpreter, and\r\ndoes not suffer the authority of Scripture to be set up against the\r\ndecisions of Councils.[764] What were those books, which without\r\nhaving read she judged to be contrary to those of Our Lord, wherein\r\nwith mind and spirit she seemed to read plainly? They would seem to be\r\nthe Sacred Canons and the Sacred Decretals. This child's utterance\r\nsapped the very foundations of the Church. Had the doctors of Poitiers\r\nbeen less zealously Armagnac they would henceforth have mistrusted\r\nJeanne and suspected her of heresy. But they were loyal servants of\r\nthe houses of Orleans and of France. Their cassocks were ragged and\r\ntheir larders empty;[765] their only hope was in God, and they feared\r\nlest in rejecting this damsel they might be denying the Holy Ghost.\r\nBesides, everything went to prove that these words of Jeanne were\r\nuttered without guile and in all ignorance and simplicity. No doubt\r\nthat is why the doctors were not shocked by them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 764: Le Pere Didon, _Vie de Jesus_, vol. i, Preface.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 765: Juvenal des Ursins, _Histoire de Charles VI_, p. 359.]\r\n\r\nBrother Seguin of Seguin in his turn questioned the damsel. He was\r\nfrom Limousin, and his speech betrayed his origin. He spoke with a\r\ndrawl and used expressions unknown in Lorraine and Champagne. Perhaps\r\nhe had that dull, heavy air, which rendered the folk of his province\r\nsomewhat ridiculous in the eyes of dwellers on the Loire, the Seine,\r\nand the Meuse. To the question: \"What language do your Voices speak?\"\r\nJeanne replied: \"A better one than yours.\"[766]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 766: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 204.]\r\n\r\nEven saints may lose patience. If Brother Seguin did not know it\r\nbefore, he learnt it that day. And what business had he to doubt that\r\nSaint Catherine and Saint Margaret, who were on the side of the\r\nFrench, spoke French? Such a doubt Jeanne could not bear, and she gave\r\nher questioner to understand that when one comes from Limousin one\r\ndoes not inquire concerning the speech of heavenly ladies.\r\nNotwithstanding he pursued his interrogation: \"Do you believe in God?\"\r\n\"Yes, more than you do,\" said the Maid, who, knowing nothing of the\r\ngood Brother, was somewhat hasty in esteeming herself better grounded\r\nin the faith than he.\r\n\r\nBut she was vexed that there should be any question of her belief in\r\nGod, who had sent her. Her reply, if favourably interpreted, would\r\ntestify to the ardour of her faith. Did Brother Seguin so understand\r\nit? His contemporaries represented him as being of a somewhat bitter\r\ndisposition. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that he was\r\ngood-natured.[767]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 767: It seems to have been the fate of the inhabitants of\r\nLimousin to be jeered at by the French of Champagne and of l'Ile de\r\nFrance. After Brother Seguin we have the student from Limousin to whom\r\nPantagruel says: \"Thou art Limousin to the bone and yet here thou wilt\r\npass thyself off as a Parisian.\" It is the lot of M. de Pourceaugnac.\r\nLa Fontaine, in 1663, writes from Limoges to his wife that the people\r\nof Limousin are by no means afflicted; neither do they labour under\r\nHeaven's displeasure \"as the folk of our provinces imagine.\" But he\r\nadds that he does not like their habits. It would seem that at first\r\nBrother Seguin was annoyed by Jeanne's mocking vivacious repartees.\r\nBut he cherished no ill-will against her. \"The Limousin's good nature\r\ndoes not permit the endurance of any unfriendly feeling,\" says Abel\r\nHugo in _La France pittoresque: Haute-Vienne_. Cf. A. Precicou,\r\n_Rabelais et les Limousins_, Limoges, 1906, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\n\"But after all,\" he said, \"it cannot be God's will that you should be\r\nbelieved unless some sign appear to make us believe in you. On your\r\nword alone we cannot counsel the King to run the risk of granting you\r\nmen-at-arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"In God's name,\" she answered, \"it was not to give a sign that I came\r\nto Poitiers. But take me to Orleans and I will show you the signs\r\nwherefore I am sent. Let me be given men, it matters not how many, and\r\nI will go to Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she repeated what she was continually saying: \"The English shall\r\nall be driven out and destroyed. The siege of Orleans shall be raised\r\nand the city delivered from its enemies, after I shall have summoned\r\nit to surrender in the name of the King of Heaven. The Dauphin shall\r\nbe anointed at Reims, the town of Paris shall return to its allegiance\r\nto the King, and the Duke of Orleans shall come back from\r\nEngland.\"[768]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 768: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 205.]\r\n\r\nLong did the doctors and masters, following the example of Brother\r\nSeguin of Seguin, urge her to show a sign of her mission. They thought\r\nthat if God had chosen her to deliver the French nation he would not\r\nfail to make his choice manifest by a sign, as he had done for Gideon,\r\nthe son of Joash. When Israel was sore pressed by the Midianites, and\r\nwhen God's chosen people hid from their enemies in the caves of the\r\nmountains, the Angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon under an oak, and\r\nsaid unto him: \"Surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smite the\r\nMidianites as one man.\" To which Gideon made answer: \"If now I have\r\nfound grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with\r\nme.\" And Gideon made ready a kid and kneaded unleavened cakes; the\r\nflesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot and brought\r\nthe pot and the basket beneath the oak. Then the Angel of God said\r\nunto him: \"Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon\r\nthis rock, and pour out the broth.\" And he did so. Then the angel of\r\nthe Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and\r\ntouched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out\r\nof the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. When\r\nGideon perceived that he had seen an angel of the Lord, he cried out:\r\n\"Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face\r\nto face.\"[769] With three hundred men Gideon subdued the Midianites.\r\nThis example the doctors had before their minds.[770]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 769: Judges, ch. vi. (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 770: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nBut for the Maid the sign of victory was victory itself. She said\r\nwithout ceasing: \"The sign that I will show you shall be Orleans\r\nrelieved and the siege raised.\"[771]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 771: _Ibid._, pp. 20, 205. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n278. _Journal du siege_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nSuch persistency made an impression on most of her interrogators. They\r\ndetermined to make of it, not a stone of stumbling, but rather an\r\nexample of zeal and a subject of edification. Since she promised them\r\na sign it behoved them in all humility to ask God to send it, and,\r\nfilled with a like hope, joining with the King and all the people, to\r\npray to the God, who delivered Israel, to grant them the banner of\r\nvictory. Thus were overcome the arguments of Brother Seguin and of\r\nthose who, led away by the precepts of human wisdom, desired a sign\r\nbefore they believed.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination which had lasted six weeks, the doctors declared\r\nthemselves satisfied.[772]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 772: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 19, 20.]\r\n\r\nThere was one point it was necessary to ascertain; they must know\r\nwhether Jeanne was, as she said, a virgin. Matrons had indeed already\r\nexamined her on her arrival at Chinon. Then there was a doubt as to\r\nwhether she were man or maid; and it was even feared that she might be\r\nan illusion in woman's semblance, produced by the art of demons, which\r\nscholars considered by no means impossible.[773] It was not long since\r\nthe death of that canon who held that now and again knights are\r\nchanged into bears and spirits travel a hundred leagues in one night,\r\nthen suddenly become sows or wisps of straw.[774] Suitable measures\r\nhad therefore been taken. But they must be carried out exactly,\r\nwisely, and cautiously, for the matter was of great importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 773: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 95; vol. iii, p. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 774: Mary Darmesteter, _Froissart_, Paris, 1894, in 12mo, p.\r\n96.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT POITIERS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nA belief, common to learned and ignorant alike, ascribed special\r\nvirtues to the state of virginity. Such ideas had been handed down\r\nfrom a remote antiquity; their origin was pre-Christian; they were an\r\nimmemorial inheritance, one part of which came from the Gauls and\r\nGermans, the other from the Romans and Greeks. In the land of Gaul\r\nthere still lingered a memory of the sacred beauty of the white\r\npriestesses of the forest; and sometimes in the Island of Sein, along\r\nthe misty shores of the Ocean, there wandered the shades of those nine\r\nsisters at whose bidding, in days of yore, the tempest raged and was\r\nstilled.\r\n\r\nAccording to these beliefs, which had dawned in the childhood of\r\nraces, the gift of prophecy is bestowed on virgins alone. It is the\r\nheritage of a Cassandra or a Velleda. It was said that Sibyls had\r\nprophesied the coming of Jesus Christ. In the Church they were\r\nconsidered the first witnesses of Christ among the Gentiles, and they\r\nwere venerated as the august sisters of the prophets of Israel. The\r\n_Dies Irae_ mentions one of them in the same breath with King David\r\nhimself. By what pious frauds their fame for prophecy was established,\r\nwe cannot tell any more than Jean Gerson or Gerard Machet. With the\r\ndoctors of the fifteenth century we must look upon these virgins as\r\nspeaking the word of truth to the nations, who venerated but did not\r\nunderstand them. Such was the ancient tradition of the Christian\r\nChurch. The most ancient fathers of the Church, Justin, Origen,\r\nClement of Alexandria, frequently made use of the Sibylline oracles;\r\nand the heathen were at a loss for a reply when Lactantius confronted\r\nthem with these prophetesses of the nations. Trusting in the word of\r\nVarro, Saint Jerome firmly believed in their existence. Into _The City\r\nof God_ Saint Augustine introduces the Erythrean Sibyl, who, he says,\r\nfaithfully foretold the Life of the Saviour. As early as the\r\nthirteenth century, these virgins of old had their places in\r\ncathedrals by the side of patriarchs and prophets. But it was not\r\nuntil the fifteenth century that multitudes of them were represented;\r\nsculptured on church porches, carved on choir stalls, painted on\r\nchapel walls or glass windows. Each one has her distinctive attribute.\r\nThe Persian holds the lantern and the Libyan the torch, which\r\nilluminated the darkness of the Gentiles. The Agrippine, the European,\r\nand Erythrean are armed with the sword; the Phrygian bears the Paschal\r\ncross; the Hellespontine presents a rose tree in flower; the others\r\ndisplay the visible signs of the mystery they foretell: the Cumaean a\r\nmanger; the Delphian, the Samian, the Tiburtine, the Cimmerian a crown\r\nof thorns, a sceptre of reeds, scourges, a cross.[775]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 775: Jean Philippe de Lignan, Rome, 1481 (not paginated),\r\nleaf 10 and the following.

Morosini,\r\nvol. iv, supplement xiv, p. 319.]\r\n\r\nThe very economy of the Christian religion--the ordering of its\r\nmysteries, wherein humanity is represented as ruined by a woman and\r\nsaved by a virgin, and all flesh is involved in Eve's curse--led to\r\nthe triumph of virginity and the exaltation of a condition which, in\r\nthe words of a Father of the Church, is in the flesh, yet not of the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n\"It is because of virginity,\" says Saint Gregory of Nyssa, \"that God\r\nvouchsafes to dwell with men. It is virginity which gives men wings to\r\nsoar towards heaven.\" Celibacy raises the Apostle John above the\r\nPrince of the Apostles himself. At the funeral of the Virgin Mary,\r\nPeter gave John a palm branch, saying: \"It becometh one who is\r\ncelibate to bear the Virgin's palm.\"[776]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 776: Voragine, _La legende doree_ (Assomption de la\r\nVierge).]\r\n\r\nThroughout western Christendom the Virgin Mary--the Virgin _par\r\nexcellence_--had been the object of zealous devout worship[777] ever\r\nsince the twelfth century. The great cathedrals of northern France,\r\ndedicated to Our Lady, celebrated the feast of their patron saint on\r\nthe day of the Assumption. On the sculptured pillar of the central\r\nporch was the Virgin, with her divine Child and the Virgin's lily.\r\nSometimes Eve figured beneath, in order to represent at once sin and\r\nits redemption: the second Eve redeeming the first, the Virgin exalted\r\nthe woman humbled. Marvellous scenes are portrayed on the tympanums of\r\nporches. The Virgin is kneeling; at her side is a flowering lily in a\r\nvase. The Angel, book in hand, greets her with an AVE, thus\r\ntransposing the name EVA, _mutans Evae nomen_. Or again, with her feet\r\nresting on the crescent moon, she rises to the highest heaven:\r\n_Exaltata est super choros angelorum_. Further, from Jesus Christ she\r\nreceives the precious crown: _Posuit in capite ejus coronam de lapide\r\npretioso_. In gems of painted glass, church windows portrayed the\r\nfigures of Mary's virginity; the stone which Daniel saw dug from the\r\nmountain by no human hand, Gideon's fleece, Moses' burning bush, and\r\nAaron's budding rod.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 777: Le Cure de Saint-Sulpice, _Notre Dame de France ou\r\nhistoire du culte de la Sainte Vierge en France_, Paris, 1862, 7 vols.\r\nin 8vo. Abbe Mignard, _La Sainte Vierge_, Paris, 1877, in 8vo, pp. 382\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn an inexhaustible flow of images, expressed in hymns, sequences, and\r\nlitanies, she was the Mystic Rose, the Ivory Tower, the Ark of the\r\nCovenant, the Gate of Heaven, the Morning Star. She was the Well of\r\nLiving Water, the Fountain of the Garden, the Walled Orchard, the\r\nBright and Shining Stone, the Flower of Virtue, the Palm of Sweetness,\r\nthe Myrtle of Temperance, the Sweet Ointment.\r\n\r\nIn the Golden Legend, images rich and charming clothed the idea that\r\ngrace and power resided in virginity. The hagiographers burst forth in\r\nloving praise of the brides of Jesus Christ; of those especially who\r\nput on the white robe of virginity and the red roses of martyrdom. It\r\nwas during the passion of virgins that miracles of the most abounding\r\ngrace were worked. Angels bring down to Dorothea celestial roses,\r\nwhich she scatters over her executioners. Virgin martyrs exercise\r\ntheir power over beasts. The lions of the amphitheatre lick the feet\r\nof Saint Thecla. The wild beasts of the circus gather together, and\r\nwith tails interlaced, prepare a throne for Saint Euphemia; in the\r\npit, aspics form a pleasing necklace for Saint Christina. It is not\r\nthe will of the divine Spouse for whom they endure anguish that they\r\nshould suffer in their modesty. When the executioner tears off Saint\r\nAgnes's garments, her hair grows thicker and clothes her in a\r\nmiraculous garment. When Saint Barbara is to be taken naked through\r\nthe streets, an angel brings her a white tunic. These Agneses and\r\nthese Dorotheas, these Catherines and these Margarets, this legion of\r\ninnocent conquerors prepared men's minds to believe in the miracle of\r\na virgin stronger than armed men. Had not Saint Genevieve turned away\r\nAttila and his barbarian warriors from Paris?\r\n\r\nThe fable of the Maid and the Unicorn, so widely known in those days,\r\nis a lively expression of this belief in a special virtue residing in\r\nthe state of virginity.\r\n\r\nThe unicorn was half goat and half horse, of immaculate whiteness; it\r\nbore a marvellous sword upon its forehead. Hunters, when they saw it\r\npass in the thicket, had never been able to reach it, so rapid was its\r\ncourse. But if a virgin in the forest called the unicorn, the creature\r\nobeyed, came and laid its head on her lap, and allowed such feeble\r\nhands to take and bind it. If however a damsel corrupt and no longer a\r\nmaid approached it, the unicorn slew her immediately.[778]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 778: _De l'unicorne qu'une jeune fille seduit_, in the\r\n_Bestiaire_ of R. de Fournival (Paulin Paris, _Manuscrits francais_,\r\nvol. iv, p. 25).

Those who would anathematise all works of the flesh she\r\nheld to be abominable and impious. A maid deserved praise for\r\npreserving her virginity, provided always that her motives were\r\npraiseworthy. Two hundred years before the reign of Charles VII, a\r\nyoung girl of Reims realised that a grave sin may be committed against\r\nthe Church of God by refusing the solicitations of a clerk in a\r\nvineyard. Here is the damsel's story as related by the canon Gervais.\r\n\r\n\"On a day, Guillaume with the White Hands, Uncle of King Philippe of\r\nFrance, for his pleasure rode forth from his town. A clerk of his\r\nfollowing, Gervais by name, who was in the heat of youth, saw a maiden\r\nwalking alone in a vineyard. He went to her, greeted her and asked:\r\n'What are you doing in such great haste?' And with fitting words he\r\ncourteously solicited her.\r\n\r\n\"Without even looking at him, calmly and gravely she replied: 'God\r\nforbid, youth, that I should ever be yours or any man's, for if I were\r\nto lose my virginity and my body its purity, I should inevitably fall\r\ninto eternal damnation.'\r\n\r\n\"Such words caused the clerk to suspect that the maiden belonged to\r\nthe impious sect of the Cathari, whom the Church was in those days\r\npursuing relentlessly and punishing severely. One of the errors of\r\nthese heretics was indeed to condemn all carnal intercourse. Impatient\r\nto resolve his doubts, Gervais straightway provoked the damsel to a\r\ndiscussion on the Church's teaching in this matter. Meanwhile, the\r\nArchbishop, Guillaume with the White Hands, turned his steed, and,\r\nfollowed by his monks, came to the vineyard where the clerk and the\r\nmaiden were disputing together. When he learnt the cause of their\r\ndisagreement he ordered the maiden to be seized and brought into the\r\ntown. There he exhorted her, and, in charity, endeavoured to convert\r\nher to the Catholic Faith.\r\n\r\n\"She would not submit, however. 'I am not well enough grounded in\r\ndoctrine to defend myself,' she said to him. 'But in the town I have a\r\nmistress, who, with good reasons, will easily refute all your\r\narguments. She it is who lodges in that house.'\r\n\r\n\"The Archbishop Guillaume straightway sent to inquire after this\r\nwoman; and, having questioned her, perceived that what the maiden had\r\nsaid concerning her was true. The very next day he convoked an\r\nassembly of clerks and nobles to judge the two women. Both of them\r\nwere condemned to be burnt. The mistress contrived to escape, but\r\npromises and persuasions having failed to turn the maiden from the\r\npernicious error of her ways, she was delivered up to the executioner.\r\nShe died without shedding a tear, without uttering a complaint.\"[780]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 780: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition en\r\nFrance_, Paris, 1893, in 8vo, p. 293.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1416 there was a certain woman, a native of the Duchy of\r\nBar, Catherine Sauve by name. She was then a solitary, living at\r\nMontpellier, on the road to Lattes. Having been publicly accused, she\r\nwas examined by the Inquisitor's Vicar, Maitre Raymond Cabasse, and\r\nfound to be infected with the heresy of the Cathari. Among other\r\nerrors she maintained that all carnal intercourse is sinful, even in\r\nwedlock. Wherefore she was delivered to the secular arm and burned at\r\nthe stake on the 2nd of November in that year.[781]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 781: Germain, _Catherine Sauve_, in _Academie des sciences\r\net lettres de Montpellier, Lettres_, vol. i, 1854, in 4to, pp.\r\n539-552.]\r\n\r\nIt was then commonly believed that such maidens as gave themselves to\r\nthe devil were straightway stripped of their virginity; and that thus\r\nhe obtained power over these unhappy creatures.[782] Such ways\r\naccorded with what was known of his libidinous disposition. These\r\npleasures were tempered to his woeful state. And thereby he gained a\r\nfurther advantage,--that of unarming his victim,--for virginity is as\r\na coat of mail against which the darts of hell are but blades of\r\nstraw. Hence it was all but certain that a soul vowed to the devil\r\ncould not reside within a maid.[783] Wherefore, there was one\r\ninfallible way of proving that the peasant girl from Vaucouleurs was\r\nnot given up to magic or to sorcery, and had made no pact with the\r\nEvil One. Recourse was had to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 782: Du Cange, _Glossaire_, under the word _Matrimonium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 783: Pierre Le Loyer, _Livre des spectres_, 1586, in 4to,\r\npp. 527, 551.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was seen, visited, privately inspected, and thoroughly examined\r\nby wise women, _mulieres doctas_; by knowing virgins, _peritas\r\nvirgines_; by widows and wives, _viduas et conjugates_. First among\r\nthese matrons were: the Queen of Sicily and of Jerusalem, Duchess of\r\nAnjou; Dame Jeanne de Preuilly, wife of the Sire de Gaucourt, Governor\r\nof Orleans, who was about fifty-seven years of age; and Dame Jeanne de\r\nMortemer, wife of Messire Robert le Macon, Lord of Treves, a man full\r\nof years.[784] The last was only eighteen, and one would have expected\r\nher to be better acquainted with the _Calendrier des Vieillards_ than\r\nwith the formulary of matrons. It is strange with what assurance the\r\ngood wives of those days undertook the solution of a problem which had\r\nappeared difficult to King Solomon in all his wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 784: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 102. Vallet de Viriville, article\r\n_Le Macon_, in _Nouvelle biographie generale_.]\r\n\r\nJeanne of Domremy was found to be a maid pure and intact.[785]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 785: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 210. Eberhard Windecke, p. 157.\r\nMorosini, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nWhile she herself was being subjected to the interrogatories of\r\ndoctors and the examination of matrons, certain clerics who had been\r\ndespatched to her native province were there prosecuting an inquiry\r\nconcerning her birth, her life, and her morals.[786] The ecclesiastics\r\nhad been chosen from those mendicant Friars[787] who could pass freely\r\nalong the highways and byways of the enemy's country without exciting\r\nthe suspicion of English and Burgundians. And, indeed, they were in no\r\nway molested. From Domremy and from Vaucouleurs they brought back sure\r\ntestimony to the humility, the devotion, the honesty, and the\r\nsimplicity of Jeanne. But, most important, they had found no\r\ndifficulty in gleaning certain pious tales, such as commonly adorned\r\nthe childhood of saints. To these monks we must attribute an important\r\nshare in the development of those legends of Jeanne's early years,\r\nwhich were so soon to become popular. From this time, apparently,\r\ndates the story that when Jeanne was in her seventh year, wolves\r\nspared her sheep, and birds of the woods came at her call and ate\r\ncrumbs from her lap.[788] Such saintly flowers suggest a Franciscan\r\norigin; among them are the wolf of Gubbio and the birds preached to by\r\nSaint Francis. These mendicants may also have furnished examples of\r\nthe Maid's prophetic gift. They may have spread abroad the story that,\r\nwhen she was at Vaucouleurs, on the day of the Battle of the Herrings,\r\nshe knew of the great hurt inflicted on the French at Rouvray.[789]\r\nThe success of such little stories was immediate and complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 786: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 787: Simeon Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. cxliii.\r\n_Trial_, vol. ii, p. 397.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 788: Letter from Perceval de Boulainvilliers to the Duke of\r\nMilan, in the _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 115, 121. _Journal d'un bourgeois\r\nde Paris_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 789: _Journal du siege_, p. 48. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 275.]\r\n\r\nAfter this examination and inquiry, the doctors came to the following\r\nconclusions: \"The King, beholding his own need and that of his realm,\r\nand considering the constant prayers to God of his poor subjects and\r\nall others who love peace and justice, ought not to repulse or reject\r\nthe Maid who says that God has sent her to bring him succour, albeit\r\nthese promises may be nothing[790] but the works of man; neither ought\r\nhe lightly or hastily to believe in her. But, according to Holy\r\nScripture he must try her in two ways: to wit, with human wisdom, by\r\ninquiring of her life, her morals, and her motive, as saith Saint Paul\r\nthe Apostle: _Probate spiritus, si ex Deo sunt_; and by earnest prayer\r\nto ask for a sign of her work and her divine hope, by which to tell\r\nwhether it is by God's will that she is come. Thus God commanded Ahaz\r\nthat he should ask for a sign when God promised him victory, saying\r\nunto him: _Pete signum a Domino_; and Gideon did likewise when he\r\nasked for a sign and many others, etc. Since the coming of the said\r\nMaid, the King hath observed her in the two manners aforesaid: to wit,\r\nby trial of human wisdom and by prayer, asking God for a sign. As for\r\nthe first, which is trial by human wisdom, he has tested the said Maid\r\nin her life, her origin, her morals, her intention; and has kept her\r\nnear him for the space of six weeks to show her to all people, whether\r\nclerks, ecclesiastics, monks, men-at-arms, wives, widows or others. In\r\npublic and in private she hath conversed with persons of all\r\nconditions. But there hath been found no evil in her, nothing but\r\ngood, humility, virginity, devoutness, honesty, simplicity. Of her\r\nbirth, as well as of her life, many marvellous things are related.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 790: The word _seules_ in the text is doubtful.]\r\n\r\n\"As for the second ordeal, the King asked her for a sign, to which she\r\nreplied that before Orleans she would give it, but neither earlier nor\r\nelsewhere, for thus it is ordained of God.\r\n\r\n\"Now, seeing that the King hath made trial of the aforesaid Maid as\r\nfar as it was in his power to do, that he findeth no evil in her, and\r\nthat her reply is that she will give a divine sign before Orleans;\r\nseeing her persistency, and the consistency of her words, and her\r\nurgent request that she be sent to Orleans to show there that the aid\r\nshe brings is divine, the King should not hinder her from going to\r\nOrleans with men-at-arms, but should send her there in due state\r\ntrusting in God. For to fear her or reject her when there is no\r\nappearance of evil in her would be to rebel against the Holy Ghost,\r\nand to render oneself unworthy of divine succour, as Gamaliel said of\r\nthe Apostles in the Council of the Jews.\"[791]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 791: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 391, 392.]\r\n\r\nIn short, the doctors' conclusion was that as yet nothing divine\r\nappeared in the Maid's promises, but that she had been examined and\r\nbeen found humble, a virgin, devout, honest, simple, and wholly good;\r\nand that, since she had promised to give a sign from God before\r\nOrleans, she must be taken there, for fear that in her the gift of the\r\nHoly Ghost should be rejected.\r\n\r\nOf these conclusions a great number of copies were made and sent to\r\nthe towns of the realm as well as to the princes of Christendom. The\r\nEmperor Sigismond, for example, received a copy.[792]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 792: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 32, 41.]\r\n\r\nIf the doctors of Poitiers had intended this six weeks inquiry,\r\nculminating in a favourable and solemn conclusion, to bring about the\r\nglorification of the Maid and the heartening of the French people by\r\nthe preparation and announcement of the marvel they had before them,\r\nthen they succeeded perfectly.[793]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 793: The conclusions of the Poitiers commission were\r\ncirculated everywhere. Traces of them are to be found in Brittany\r\n(Buchon and _Chronique de Morosini_), in Flanders (_Chronique de\r\nTournai_ and _Chronique de Morosini_), in Germany (Eb. Windecke), in\r\nDauphine (Buchon).]\r\n\r\nThat prolonged investigation, that minute examination reassured those\r\ndoubting minds among the French, who suspected a woman dressed as a\r\nman of being a devil; they flattered men's imaginations with the hope\r\nof a miracle; they appealed to all hearts to judge favourably of the\r\ndamsel who came forth radiant from the fire of ordeal and appeared as\r\nif glorified with a celestial halo. Her vanquishing the doctors in\r\nargument made her seem like another Saint Catherine.[794] But that she\r\nshould have met difficult questions with wise answers was not enough\r\nfor a multitude eager for marvels. It was imagined that she had been\r\nsubjected to a strange probation from which she had come forth by\r\nnothing short of a miracle. Thus a few weeks after the inquiry, the\r\nfollowing wonderful story was related in Brittany and in Flanders:\r\nwhen at Poitiers she was preparing to receive the communion, the\r\npriest had one wafer that was consecrated and another that was not. He\r\nwanted to give her the unconsecrated wafer. She took it in her hand\r\nand told the priest that it was not the body of Christ her Redeemer,\r\nbut that the body was in the wafer which the priest had covered with\r\nthe corporal.[795] After that there could be no doubt that Jeanne was\r\na great saint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 794: \"_Altra santa Catarina_\" (Morosini, vol. iii, p. 52).\r\nThere is no doubt that here she is compared to Saint Catherine of\r\nAlexandria and not to Saint Catherine of Sienna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 795: Morosini, vol. iii, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the inquiries, a favourable opportunity for\r\nintroducing the Maid into Orleans arrived in the beginning of April.\r\nFor her arming and her accoutring she was sent first to Tours.[796]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 66, 210.]\r\n\r\nSixty-six years later, an inhabitant of Poitiers, almost a hundred\r\nyears old, told a young fellow-citizen that he had seen the Maid set\r\nout for Orleans on horseback, in white armour.[797] He pointed to the\r\nvery stone from which she had mounted her horse in the corner of the\r\nRue Saint-Etienne. Now, when Jeanne was at Poitiers, she was not in\r\narmour. But the people of Poitou had named the stone \"the Maid's\r\nmounting stone.\" With what a glad eager step the Saint must have leapt\r\nfrom that stone on to the horse which was to carry her away from those\r\nfurred cats to the afflicted and oppressed whom she was longing to\r\nsuccour.[798]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: Jean Bouchet, _Annales d'Aquitaine_, in the _Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, pp. 536, 537.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: Guilbert, _Histoire des villes de France_, vol. iv,\r\nPoitiers. Cf. B. Ledain, _La Maison de Jeanne d'Arc a Poitiers_,\r\nSaint-Maixent, 1892, in 8vo. According to M. Ledain the Hotel de la\r\nRose was on the spot now occupied by a house, number 13 in La Rue\r\nNotre-Dame-la-Petite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT TOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tours the Maid lodged in the house of a dame commonly called\r\nLapau.[799] She was Eleonore de Paul, a woman of Anjou, who had been\r\nlady-in-waiting to Queen Marie of Anjou. Married to Jean du Puy, Lord\r\nof La Roche-Saint-Quentin, Councillor of the Queen of Sicily, she had\r\nremained in the service of the Queen of France.[800]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 799: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 800: Vallet de Viriville, _Notices et extraits de chartes et\r\nde manuscrits appartenant au British Museum de Londres_, in the\r\n_Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, vol. viii, pp. 139, 140.]\r\n\r\nThe town of Tours belonged to the Queen of Sicily, who grew richer and\r\nricher as her son-in-law grew poorer and poorer. She aided him with\r\nmoney and with lands. In 1424, the duchy of Touraine with all its\r\ndependencies, except the castellany of Chinon, had come into her\r\npossession.[801] The burgesses and commonalty of Tours earnestly\r\ndesired peace. Meanwhile they made every effort to escape from pillage\r\nat the hands of men-at-arms. Neither King Charles nor Queen Yolande\r\nwas able to defend them, so they must needs defend themselves.[802]\r\nWhen the town watchmen announced the approach of one of those\r\nmarauding chiefs who were ravaging Touraine and Anjou, the citizens\r\nshut their gates and saw to it that the culverins were in their\r\nplaces. Then there was a parley: the captain from the brink of the\r\nmoat maintained that he was in the King's service and on his way to\r\nfight the English; he asked for a night's rest in the town for himself\r\nand his men. From the heights of the ramparts he was politely\r\nrequested to pass on; and, in case he should be tempted to force an\r\nentry, a sum of money was offered him.[803] Thus the citizens fleeced\r\nthemselves for fear of being robbed. In like manner, only a few days\r\nbefore Jeanne's coming, they had given the Scot, Kennedy, who was\r\nravaging the district, two hundred livres to go on. When they had got\r\nrid of their defenders, their next care was to fortify themselves\r\nagainst the English. On the 29th of February of this same year, 1429,\r\nthese citizens lent one hundred crowns to Captain La Hire, who was\r\nthen doing his best for Orleans. And even on the approach of the\r\nEnglish they consented to receive forty archers belonging to the\r\ncompany of the Sire de Bueil, only on condition that Bueil should\r\nlodge in the castle with twenty men, and that the others should be\r\nquartered in the inns, where they were to have nothing without paying\r\nfor it. Thus it was or was not; and the Sire de Bueil went off to\r\ndefend Orleans.[804]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 801: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p.\r\n77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 802: Vallet de Viriville, _Analyse et fragments tires des\r\nArchives municipales de Tours_ in _Cabinet historique_, vol. v, pp.\r\n102-121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 803: Quicherat, _Rodrigue de Villandrando_, Paris, 1879, in\r\n8vo, pp. 14 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 804: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, Introduction, p. xxii, note 1.]\r\n\r\nIn Jean du Puy's house, Jeanne was visited by an Augustinian monk, one\r\nJean Pasquerel. He was returning from the town of Puy-en-Velay where\r\nhe had met Isabelle Romee and certain of those who had conducted\r\nJeanne to the King.[805]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 805: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nIn this town, in the sanctuary of Anis, was preserved an image of the\r\nMother of God, brought from Egypt by Saint Louis. It was of great\r\nantiquity and highly venerated, for the prophet Jeremiah had with his\r\nown hands carved it out of sycamore wood in the semblance of the\r\nvirgin yet to be born, whom he had seen in a vision.[806] In holy week,\r\npilgrims flocked from all parts of France and of Europe,--nobles,\r\nclerks, men-at-arms, citizens and peasants; and many, for penance or\r\nthrough poverty, came on foot, staff in hand, begging their bread from\r\ndoor to door. Merchants of all kinds betook themselves thither; and it\r\nwas at once the most popular of pilgrimages and one of the richest\r\nfairs in the world. All round the town the stream of travellers\r\noverflowed from the road on to vineyards, meadows, and gardens. On the\r\nday of the Festival, in the year 1407, two hundred persons perished,\r\ncrushed to death in the throng.[807]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 806: Francisque Mandet, _Histoire du Velay_, Le Puy,\r\n1860-1862 (7 vols. in 12mo), vol. i, pp. 590 _et seq._ S. Luce,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, ch. xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 807: Jean Juvenal des Ursins, 1407.]\r\n\r\nIn certain years the feast of the conception of Our Lord fell on the\r\nsame day as that of his death; and thus there coincided the promise\r\nand the fulfilment of the promise of the greatest of mysteries. Then\r\nHoly Friday became still holier. It was called Great Friday, and on\r\nthat day such as entered the sanctuary of Anis received plenary\r\nindulgence. On that day the crowd of pilgrims was greater than usual.\r\nNow, in the year 1429, Good Friday fell on the 25th of March, the day\r\nof the Annunciation.[808]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 808: Nicole de Savigni, _Notes sur les exploits de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc et sur divers evenements de son temps_, in the _Bulletin de la\r\nSociete de l'Histoire de Paris_, 1, 1874, p. 43. Chanoine Lucot,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc en Champagne_, Chalons, 1880, pp. 12, 13.]\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, nothing extraordinary in Brother Pasquerel's\r\nmeeting Jeanne's relatives at Puy during Holy Week. That a peasant\r\nwoman should travel two hundred and fifty miles on foot, through a\r\ncountry infested with soldiers and other robbers, in a season of snows\r\nand mist, to obtain an indulgence, was an every-day matter if we\r\nremember the surname which had for long been hers.[809] This was not\r\nLa Romee's first pilgrimage. As we do not know which members of the\r\nMaid's escort the good Brother met, we are at liberty to conjecture\r\nthat Bertrand de Poulengy was among them. We know little about him,\r\nbut his speech would suggest that he was a devout person.[810]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 809: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 191; vol. ii, p. 74, note. La Romee\r\nmay have received her surname for an entirely different reason. Most\r\nof our knowledge of Jeanne's mother is derived from documents of very\r\ndoubtful authenticity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 810: Francis C. Lowell considers the idea of La Romee's\r\npilgrimage to Puy as a \"characteristic example of the madness\" of\r\nSimeon Luce (_Joan of Arc_, Boston, 1896, in 8vo, p. 72, note).\r\nNevertheless, after considerable hesitation, I, like Luce, have\r\nrejected the corrections proposed by Lebrun de Charmettes and\r\nQuicherat, and adopted unamended the text of the _Trial_.]\r\n\r\nJeanne's comrades, having made friends with Pasquerel, said to him:\r\n\"You must go with us to Jeanne. We will not leave you until you have\r\ntaken us to her.\" They travelled together. Brother Pasquerel went with\r\nthem to Chinon, which Jeanne had left; then he went on to Tours, where\r\nhis convent was.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians, who claimed to have received their rule from St.\r\nFrancis himself, wore the grey habit of the Franciscans. It was from\r\ntheir order that in the previous year the King had chosen a chaplain\r\nfor his young son, the Dauphin Louis. Brother Pasquerel held the\r\noffice of reader (_lector_) in his monastery.[811] He was in priest's\r\norders. Quite young doubtless and of a wandering disposition, like\r\nmany mendicant monks of those days, he had a taste for the miraculous,\r\nand was excessively credulous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 811: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 101. For the meaning of _Lector_,\r\nprofessor of theology, cf. Du Cange.]\r\n\r\nJeanne's comrades said to her: \"Jeanne, we have brought you this good\r\nfather. You will like him well when you know him.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"The good father pleases me. I have already heard tell of\r\nhim, and even to-morrow will I confess to him.\" The next day the good\r\nfather heard her in confession, and chanted mass before her. He became\r\nher chaplain, and never left her.[812]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 812: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 101 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century Tours was one of the chief manufacturing\r\ntowns of the kingdom. The inhabitants excelled in all kinds of trades.\r\nThey wove tissues of silk, of gold, and of silver. They manufactured\r\ncoats of mail; and, while not competing with the armourers of Milan,\r\nof Nuremberg, and of Augsburg, they were skilled in the forging and\r\nhammering of steel.[813] Here it was that, by the King's command, the\r\nmaster armourer made Jeanne a suit of mail.[814] The suit he furnished\r\nwas of wrought iron; and, according to the custom of that time,\r\nconsisted of a helmet, a cuirass in four parts, with epaulets,\r\narmlets, elbow-pieces, fore-armlets, gauntlets, cuisses, knee-pieces,\r\ngreaves and shoes.[815] The maker had doubtless no thought of\r\naccentuating the feminine figure. But the armour of that period, full\r\nin the bust, slight in the waist, with broad skirts beneath the\r\ncorselet, in its slender grace and curious slimness, always has the\r\nair of a woman's armour, and seems made for Queen Penthesilea or for\r\nthe Roman Camilla. The Maid's armour was white and unadorned, if one\r\nmay judge from its modest price of one hundred _livres tournois_. The\r\ntwo suits of mail, made at the same time by the same armourer for Jean\r\nde Metz and his comrade, were together worth one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five _livres tournois_.[816] Possibly one of the skilful and\r\nrenowned drapers of Tours took the Maid's measure for a _houppelande_\r\nor loose coat in silk or cloth of gold or silver, such as captains\r\nwore over the cuirass. To look well, the coat, which was open in\r\nfront, must be cut in scallops that would float round the horseman as\r\nhe rode. Jeanne loved fine clothes but still more fine horses.[817]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 813: E. Giraudet, _Histoire de la ville de Tours_, Tours,\r\n1874, 2 vols. in 8vo, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 814: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 67, 94, 210; vol. iv, pp. 3,\r\n301, 363.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 815: J.

But the complete horse's armour\r\nwas included in this\" (Maurice Maindron, _Pour l'histoire de\r\nl'armure_, in _Le monde moderne_, 1896). According to the calculation\r\nof P. Clement (_Jacques Coeur et Charles VII_, 1873, p. lxvi), 100\r\nlivres would be equal to 4000 francs of present money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 817: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 76.

Le Fevre de Saint-Remy,\r\n_ibid._, p. 439.]\r\n\r\nThe King invited her to choose a horse from his stables. If we may\r\nbelieve a certain Latin poet, she selected an animal of illustrious\r\norigin, but very old. It was a war horse, which Pierre de Beauvau,\r\nGovernor of Maine and Anjou, had given to one of the King's two\r\nbrothers; who had both been dead, the one thirteen years, the other\r\ntwelve.[818] This steed, or another, was brought to Lapau's house and\r\nthe Duke of Alencon went to see it. The horse must likewise be\r\naccoutred, it must be furnished with a chanfrin to protect its head\r\nand one of those wooden saddles with broad pommels which seemed to\r\nencase the rider.[819] A shield was out of the question. Since\r\nchain-armour, which was not proof against blows, had been succeeded by\r\nthat plate-armour, on which nothing could make an impression, they had\r\nceased to be used save in pageants. As for the sword,--the noblest\r\npart of her accoutrement and the bright symbol of strength joined to\r\nloyalty,--Jeanne refused to take that from the royal armourer; she was\r\nresolved to receive it from the hand of Saint Catherine herself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: Anonymous poem in the _Trial_, vol. v, p. 38 and note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 819: Capitaine Champion, _Jeanne d'Arc ecuyere_, pp. 146 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nWe know that on her coming into France she had stopped at Fierbois and\r\nheard three masses in Saint Catherine's chapel.[820] Therein the\r\nVirgin of Alexandria had many swords, without counting the one Charles\r\nMartel was said to have given her, and which it would not have been\r\neasy to find again. A good Touranian in Touraine, Saint Catherine was\r\nan Armagnac ever on the side of those who fought for the Dauphin\r\nCharles. When captains and soldiers of fortune stood in danger of\r\ndeath, or were prisoners in the hands of their enemies, she was the\r\nsaint they most willingly invoked; for they knew she wished them\r\nwell. She did not save them all, but she aided many. They came to\r\nrender her thanks; and as a sign of gratitude they offered her their\r\narmour, so that her chapel looked like an armoury.[821] The walls\r\nbristled with swords; and, as gifts had been flowing in for half a\r\ncentury, ever since the days of King Charles V, the sacristans were\r\nprobably in the habit of taking down the old weapons to make room for\r\nthe new, hoarding the old steel in some store-house until an\r\nopportunity arrived for selling it.[822] Saint Catherine could not\r\nrefuse a sword to the damsel, whom she loved so dearly that every day\r\nand every hour she came down from Paradise to see and talk with her on\r\nearth,--a maiden who in return had shown her devotion by travelling to\r\nFierbois to do the Saint reverence. For we must not omit to state that\r\nSaint Catherine in company with Saint Margaret had never ceased to\r\nappear to Jeanne both at Chinon and at Tours. She was present at all\r\nthose secret assemblies, which the Maid called sometimes her Council\r\nbut oftener her Voices, doubtless because they appealed more to her\r\nears and her mind than to her eyes, despite the burst of light which\r\nsometimes dazzled her, and notwithstanding the crowns she was able to\r\ndiscern on the heads of the saints. The Voices indicated one sword\r\namong the multitude of those in the Chapel at Fierbois. Messire\r\nRichard Kyrthrizian and Brother Gille Lecourt, both of them priests,\r\nwere then custodians of the chapel. Such is the title they assumed\r\nwhen they signed the accounts of miracles worked by their saint.\r\nJeanne in a letter caused them to be asked for the sword, which had\r\nbeen revealed to her. In the letter she said that it would be found\r\nunderground, not very deep down, and behind the altar. At least these\r\nwere all the directions she was able to give afterwards, and then she\r\ncould not quite remember whether it was behind the altar or in front.\r\nWas she able to give the custodians of the chapel any signs by which\r\nto recognise the sword? She never explained this point, and her letter\r\nis lost.[823]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 820: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 56, 75, 76, 77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 821: Abbe Bourasse, _Les miracles de madame sainte Katerine\r\nde Fierboys en Touraine_ (1375-1446), Tours, 1858, in 8vo, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 822: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 277. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 823: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 77. _Les miracles de madame sainte\r\nKaterine_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that she believed the sword had been shown to\r\nher in a vision and in no other manner. An armourer of Touraine, whom\r\nshe did not know (afterwards she maintained that she had never seen\r\nhim), was appointed to carry the letter to Fierbois. The custodians of\r\nthe chapel gave him a sword marked with five crosses, or with five\r\nlittle swords on the blade, not far from the hilt. In what part of the\r\nchapel had they found it? No one knows. A contemporary says it was in\r\na coffer with some old iron. If it had been buried and hidden it was\r\nnot very long before, because the rust could easily be removed by\r\nrubbing. The priests were careful to offer it to the Maid with great\r\nceremony[824] before giving it to the armourer who had come for it.\r\nThey enclosed it in a sheath of red velvet, embroidered with the royal\r\nflowers de luce. When Jeanne received it she recognised it to be the\r\none revealed to her in a celestial vision and promised her by her\r\nVoices, and she failed not to let the little company of monks and\r\nsoldiers who surrounded her know that it was so. This they took to be\r\na good omen and a sign of victory.[825] To protect Saint Catherine's\r\nsword the priests of the town gave her a second sheath; this one was\r\nof black cloth. Jeanne had a third made of very tough leather.[826]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 824: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 76, 234, 236. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 277. _Journal du siege_, p. 49.

It was said to be the sword of the great Charles\r\nMartel, long buried and forgotten. Many believed it had belonged to\r\nAlexander and the knights of those ancient days. Every one thought\r\nwell of it and esteemed it likely to bring good fortune. When the\r\nEnglish and the Burgundians heard tell of the matter, there soon\r\noccurred to them the idea that the Maid had discovered what was hidden\r\nbeneath the earth by taking counsel of demons; or they suspected her\r\nof having herself craftily hidden the sword in the place she had\r\nindicated in order to deceive princes, clergy, and people. They\r\nwondered anxiously whether those five crosses were not signs of the\r\ndevil.[827] Thus there began to arise conflicting illusions, according\r\nto which Jeanne appeared either saint or sorceress.[828]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 827: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 108, 109. _Chronique de\r\nLorraine_, in the _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 332. Eberhard Windecke, p. 101.\r\nCf. _Journal du siege_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 828: Jean Chartier, vol. i, p. 122.]\r\n\r\nThe King had given her no command. Acting according to the counsel of\r\nthe doctors, he did not hinder her from going to Orleans with\r\nmen-at-arms. He even had her taken there in state in order that she\r\nmight give the promised sign. He granted her men to conduct her, not\r\nfor her to conduct. How could she have conducted them since she did\r\nnot know the way? Meanwhile she had a standard made according to the\r\ncommand of Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret, who had said: \"Take the\r\nstandard in the name of the King of Heaven!\" It was of a coarse white\r\ncloth, or buckram, edged with silk fringe. At the bidding of her\r\nVoices, Jeanne caused a painter of the town to represent on it what\r\nshe called \"the World,\"[829] that is, Our Lord seated upon his throne,\r\nblessing with his right hand, and in his left holding the globe of the\r\nworld. On his right and on his left were angels, both painted as they\r\nwere in churches, and presenting Our Lord with flowers de luce. Above\r\nor on one side were the names Jhesus--Maria, and the background was\r\nstrewn with the royal lilies in gold.[830] She also had a coat-of-arms\r\npainted: on an azure shield a silver dove, holding in its beak a\r\nscroll on which was written: \"_De par le Roi du Ciel_.\"[831] This\r\ncoat-of-arms she had painted on the reverse of the standard bearing on\r\nthe front the picture of Our Lord. A servant of the Duke of Alencon,\r\nPerceval de Cagny, says that she ordered to be made another and a\r\nsmaller standard, a banner, on which was the picture of Our Lady\r\nreceiving the angel's salutation. The Tours painter Jeanne employed\r\ncame from Scotland and was called Hamish Power. He provided the\r\nmaterial and executed the paintings of the two escutcheons, of the\r\nsmall one as well as of the large. For this he received from the\r\nkeeper of the war treasury twenty-five _livres tournois_.[832] Hamish\r\nPower had a daughter, Heliote by name, who was about to be married and\r\nto whom Jeanne afterwards showed kindness.[833]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 829: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 77, 179, 236; vol. iii, p. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 830: _Ibid._, pp. 78, 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 831: _Ibid._, pp. 78, 117, 181, 300. _Relation du greffier\r\nde La Rochelle_, p. 338.

For long only kings,\r\nemperors, and leaders in war had had the right of raising it. The\r\nfeudal suzerain had it carried before him; vassals ranged themselves\r\nbeneath their lord's banners. But in 1429 banners had ceased to be\r\nused save in corporations, guilds, and parishes, borne only before the\r\narmies of peace. In war they were no longer needed. The meanest\r\ncaptain, the poorest knight had his own standard. When fifty French\r\nmen-at-arms went forth from Orleans against a handful of English\r\nmarauders, a crowd of banners like a swarm of butterflies waved over\r\nthe fields. \"To raise one's standard\" came to be a figure of speech\r\nfor \"to be puffed up.\"[834] So indeed it was permissible for a\r\nfreebooter to raise his standard when he commanded scarce a score of\r\nmen-at-arms and half-naked bowmen. Even if Jeanne, as she may have\r\ndone, held her standard to be a sign of sovereign command, and if,\r\nhaving received it from the King of Heaven, she thought to raise it\r\nabove all others, was there a soul in the realm to say her nay? What\r\nhad become of all those feudal banners which for eighty years had been\r\nin the vanguard of defeat; sown over the fields of Crecy; collected\r\nbeneath bushes and hedges by Welsh and Cornish swordsmen; lost in the\r\nvineyards of Maupertuis, trampled underfoot by English archers on the\r\nsoft earth into which sank the corpses of Azincourt; gathered in\r\nhandfuls under the walls of Verneuil by Bedford's marauders? It was\r\nbecause all these banners had miserably fallen, it was because at\r\nRouvray a prince of the blood royal had shamefully trailed his nobles'\r\nbanners in flight, that the peasant now raised her banner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 834: In Beaudouin de Sebourg (xx, 249) is the passage:\r\n\r\n    _Il est cousin au conte\r\n    Il en fait estandart_\r\n\r\nquoted by Godefroy. Cf. La Curne and Littre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF ORLEANS FROM THE 7TH OF MARCH TO THE 28TH OF APRIL, 1429\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the terrible and ridiculous discomfiture of the King's men in\r\nthe Battle of the Herrings, the citizens of Orleans had lost all faith\r\nin their defenders.[835] Their minds agitated, suspicious and\r\ncredulous were possessed by phantoms of fear and wrath. Suddenly and\r\nwithout reason they believe themselves betrayed. One day it is\r\nannounced that a hole big enough for a man to pass through has been\r\nmade in the town wall just where it skirts the outbuildings of the\r\nAumone.[836] A crowd of people hasten to the spot; they see the hole\r\nand a piece of the wall which had been restored, with two loop-holes;\r\nthey fail to understand, and think themselves sold and betrayed into\r\nthe enemy's hands; they rave and break forth into howls, and seek the\r\npriest in charge of the hospital to tear him to pieces.[837] A few\r\ndays after, on Holy Thursday, a similar rumour is spread abroad:\r\ntraitors are about to deliver up the town into the hands of the\r\nEnglish. The folk seize their weapons; soldiers, burgesses, villeins\r\nmount guard on the outworks, on the walls and in the streets. On the\r\nmorrow, the day after that on which the panic had originated, fear\r\nstill possesses them.[838]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 835: \"_Pourquoy la Hire, Poton et plusieurs autres vaillants\r\nhommes qui moult enviz s'en alloient ainsi honteusement_,\" _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 836: The hospital of Orleans, close to the cathedral.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 837: 9 March. _Journal du siege_, pp. 56, 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 838: _Journal du siege_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of March the besiegers saw approaching the Norman\r\nvassals, summoned by the Regent. But they were only six hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine lances all told, and they were only bound to serve for\r\ntwenty-six days. Under the leadership of Scales, Pole, and Talbot, the\r\nEnglish continued the investment works as best they could.[839] On the\r\n10th of March, two and a half miles east of the city, they occupied\r\nwithout opposition the steep slope of Saint-Loup and began to erect a\r\nbastion there, which should command the upper river and the two roads\r\nfrom Gien and Pithiviers, at the point where they meet near the\r\nBurgundian gate.[840] On the 20th of March they completed the bastion\r\nnamed London, on the road to Mans. Between the 9th and 15th of April\r\ntwo new bastions were erected towards the west, Rouen nine hundred\r\nfeet east of London, Paris nine hundred feet from Rouen. About the\r\n20th they fortified Saint-Jean-le-Blanc across the Loire and\r\nestablished a watch to guard the crossing of the river.[841] This was\r\nbut little in comparison with what remained to be done, and they were\r\nshort of men; for they had less than three thousand round the town.\r\nWherefore they fell upon the peasants. Now that the season for tending\r\nthe vines was drawing near, the country folk went forth into the\r\nfields thinking only of the land; but the English lay in wait for\r\nthem, and when they had taken them prisoners, set them to work.[842]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 839: Boucher de Molandon, _L'armee anglaise vaincue par\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, ch. ii.

They were furnished with no stabling for\r\nhorses. They could not be built near enough to render assistance to\r\neach other; the besieger was in danger of being himself besieged in\r\nthem. In short, from these vexatious methods of warfare the English\r\nreaped nothing but disappointment and disgrace. The Sire de Bueil, one\r\nof the defenders, perceived this when he was reconnoitring.[843] In\r\nfact it was so easy to pass through the enemy's lines that merchants\r\nwere willing to run the risk of taking cattle to the besieged. There\r\nentered into the town, on the 7th of March, six horses loaded with\r\nherrings; on the 15th, six horses with powder; on the 29th, cattle and\r\nvictuals; on the 2nd of April, nine fat oxen and horses; on the 5th,\r\none hundred and one pigs and six fat oxen; on the 9th, seventeen pigs,\r\nhorses, sucking-pigs, and corn; on the 13th, coins with which to pay\r\nthe garrison; on the 16th, cattle and victuals; on the 23rd, powder\r\nand victuals. And more than once the besieged had carried off, in the\r\nvery faces of the English, victuals and ammunition destined for the\r\nbesiegers and including casks of wine, game, horses, bows, forage, and\r\neven twenty-six head of large cattle.[844]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 843: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, p. xxii; vol. ii, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 844: _Journal du siege_, pp. 56, 62.]\r\n\r\nThe siege was costing the English dear,--forty thousand _livres\r\ntournois_ a month.[845] They were short of money; they were obliged to\r\nresort to the most irritating expedients. By a decree of the 3rd of\r\nMarch King Henry had recently ordered all his officers in Normandy to\r\nlend him one quarter of their pay.[846] In their huts of wood and\r\nearth, the men-at-arms, who had endured much from the cold, now began\r\nto suffer hunger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 845: Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_, pp. 50, 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: Pierre Sureau's account in Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee\r\nanglaise_, proofs and illustrations, no. vi, pp. 45, 46.]\r\n\r\nThe wasted fields of La Beauce, of l'Ile-de-France, and of Normandy\r\ncould furnish them with no great store of sheep or oxen. Their food\r\nwas bad, their drink worse. The vintage of 1427 had been bad, that of\r\nthe following year was poor and weak--more like sour grapes than\r\nwine.[847] Now an old English author has written of the soldiers of\r\nhis country:\r\n\r\n    \"They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:\r\n    Either they must be dieted like mules\r\n    And have their provender tied to their mouths\r\n    Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.\"[848]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 221, 222 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: Shakespeare, _Henry VI_, part i, act i, scene ii.\r\nAccording to M. G. Duval the first part of this play was adapted from\r\none of Shakespeare's predecessors.]\r\n\r\nA sudden humiliation still further weakened the English. Captain Poton\r\nde Saintrailles and the two magistrates, Guyon du Fosse and Jean de\r\nSaint-Avy, who had gone on an embassy to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nreturned to Orleans on the 17th of April. The Duke had granted their\r\nrequest and consented to take the town under his protection. But the\r\nRegent, to whom the offer had been made, would not have it thus.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he would be very sorry if after he had beaten the bush\r\nanother should go off with the nestlings.[849] Therefore the offer was\r\nrejected. Nevertheless the embassy had been by no means useless, and\r\nit was something to have raised a new cause of quarrel between the\r\nDuke and the Regent. The ambassadors returned accompanied by a\r\nBurgundian herald who blew his trumpet in the English camp, and, in\r\nthe name of his master, commanded all combatants who owed allegiance\r\nto the Duke to raise the siege. Some hundreds of archers and\r\nmen-at-arms, Burgundians, men of Picardy and of Champagne, departed\r\nforthwith.[850]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 849: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 850: _Journal du siege_, pp. 69, 70. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 270.

They slew the watch and entered the\r\ncamp, where they found piles of money, robes of martin, and a goodly\r\nstore of weapons. Absorbed in pillage, they paid no heed to defending\r\nthemselves and were surprised by the enemy, who in great force had\r\nhastened to the place. They fled pursued by the English who slew many.\r\nOn that day the town resounded with the lamentations of women weeping\r\nfor a father, a husband, a brother, kinsmen.[851]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 851: _Journal du siege_, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nWithin those walls, in a space where there was room for not more than\r\nfifteen thousand inhabitants, forty thousand[852] were huddled\r\ntogether, one vast multitude agonised by all manner of suffering;\r\ndepressed by domestic sorrow; racked with anxiety; maddened by\r\nconstant danger and perpetual panic. Although the wars of those days\r\nwere not so sanguinary as they became later, the sallies of the\r\ninhabitants of Orleans were the occasion of constant and considerable\r\nloss of life. Since the middle of March the English bullets had fallen\r\nmore into the centre of the town; and they were not always harmless.\r\nOn the eve of Palm Sunday one stone, fired from a mortar, killed or\r\nwounded five persons; another, seven.[853] Many of the inhabitants,\r\nlike the provost, Alain Du Bey, died of fatigue or of the infected\r\nair.[854]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 852: Jollois, _Histoire du siege_, part vi, ch. i.

Morosini, vol. iii, p. 25, note\r\n2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 853: _Journal du siege_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 854: _Ibid._, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nIn the Christendom of those days all men were taught to believe that\r\nearthquakes, wars, famine, pestilence are punishments for wrong-doing.\r\nCharles, the Fair Duke of Orleans, good Christian that he was, held\r\nthat great sorrows had come upon France as chastisement for her sins,\r\nto wit: swelling pride, gluttony, sloth, covetousness, lust, and\r\nneglect of justice, which were rife in the realm; and in a ballad he\r\ndiscoursed of the evil and its remedy.[855] The people of Orleans\r\nfirmly believed that this war was sent to them of God to punish\r\nsinners, who had worn out his patience. They were aware both of the\r\ncause of their sorrows and of the means of remedying them. Such was\r\nthe teaching of the good friars preachers; and, as Duke Charles put it\r\nin his ballad, the remedy was to live well, to amend one's life, to\r\nhave masses said and sung for the souls of those who had suffered\r\ndeath in the service of the realm, to renounce the sinful life, and to\r\nask forgiveness of Our Lady and the saints.[856] This remedy had been\r\nadopted by the people of Orleans. They had had masses said in the\r\nChurch of Sainte-Croix for the souls of nobles, captains, and\r\nmen-at-arms killed in their service, and especially for those who had\r\ndied a piteous death in the Battle of the Herrings. They had offered\r\ncandles to Our Lady and to the patron saints of the town, and had\r\ncarried the shrine of Saint-Aignan round the walls.[857]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 855: Charles d'Orleans, _Poesies_, edited by A.\r\nChampollion-Figeac, Paris, 1842, in 8vo, p. 176.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 856: Miniature in the MS. of the poems of Charles d'Orleans,\r\nin the British Museum, Royal 16 F. ii, fol. 73 v'o.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 857: _Journal du siege_, p. 43. Symphorien Guyon, _Histoire\r\nde la ville d'Orleans_, vol. ii, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nEvery time they felt themselves in great danger, they brought it forth\r\nfrom the Church of Sainte-Croix, carried it in grand procession round\r\nthe town and over the ramparts,[858] then, having brought it back to\r\nthe cathedral, they listened to a sermon preached in the porch by a\r\ngood monk chosen by the magistrates.[859] They said prayers in public\r\nand resolved to amend their lives. Wherefore they believed that in\r\nParadise Saint Euverte and Saint-Aignan, touched by their piety, must\r\nbe interceding for them with Our Lord; and they thought they could\r\nhear the voices of the two pontiffs. Saint Euverte was saying,\r\n\"All-powerful Father, I pray and entreat thee to save the city of\r\nOrleans. It is mine. I was its bishop. I am its patron saint. Deliver\r\nit not up to its enemies.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 858: _Chronique de la fete_, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n297.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 859: Accounts of the Commune, _passim_, in _Journal du\r\nsiege_, pp. 210 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThen afterwards spoke Saint-Aignan: \"Give peace to the people of\r\nOrleans. Father, thou who by the mouth of a child didst appoint me\r\ntheir shepherd, grant that they fall not into the hands of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Orleans expected that the Lord would not at once\r\nanswer the prayers of the two confessors. Knowing the sternness of his\r\njudgments they feared lest he would reply: \"For their sins are the\r\nFrench people justly chastised. They suffer because of their\r\ndisobedience to Holy Church. From the least to the greatest in the\r\nrealm each vies with the other in evil-doing. The husbandmen,\r\ncitizens, lawyers and priests are hard and avaricious; the princes,\r\ndukes and noble lords are proud, vain, cursers, swearers, and\r\ntraitors. The corruptness of their lives infects the air. It is just\r\nthat they suffer chastisement.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Lord should speak thus must be expected, because he was angry\r\nand because the people of Orleans had greatly sinned. But now, behold,\r\nOur Lady, she who loves the King of the Lilies, prays for him and for\r\nthe Duke of Orleans to the Son, whose pleasure it is to do her will in\r\nall things: \"My Son, with all my heart I entreat thee to drive the\r\nEnglish from the land of France; they have no right to it. If they\r\ntake Orleans, then they will take the rest at their pleasure. Suffer\r\nit not, O my Son, I beseech thee.\" And Our Lord, at the prayer of his\r\nholy Mother, forgives the French and consents to save them.[860]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 860: _Mistere du siege_, lines 6964 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThus in those days, according to their ideas of the spiritual world,\r\ndid men represent even the councils of Paradise. There were folk not a\r\nfew, and those not unlearned, who believed that as the result of these\r\ncouncils Our Lord had sent his Archangel to the shepherdess. And it\r\nmight even be possible that he would save the kingdom by the hand of a\r\nwoman. Is it not in the weak things of the world that he maketh his\r\npower manifest?\r\n\r\nDid he not allow the child David to overthrow the giant Goliath, and\r\ndid he not deliver into the hands of Judith the head of Holophernes?\r\nIn Orleans itself was it not by the mouth of a babe that he had caused\r\nto be named that shepherd who was to deliver the besieged town from\r\nAttila?[861]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 861: Aug. Theiner, _Saint Aignan ou le siege d'Orleans par\r\nAttila, notice historique suivie de la vie de ce saint, tiree des MSS.\r\nde la Bibliotheque du Roi_, Paris, 1832, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord of Villars and Messire Jamet du Tillay, having returned from\r\nChinon, reported that they had with their own eyes seen the Maid; and\r\nthey told of the marvels of her coming. They related how she had\r\ntravelled far, fording rivers, passing by many towns and villages held\r\nby the English, as well as through those French lands wherein were\r\nrife pillage and all manner of evils. Then they went on to tell how,\r\nwhen she was taken to the King, she had spoken fair words to him as\r\nshe curtsied, saying: \"Gentle Dauphin, God sends me to help and\r\nsuccour you. Give me soldiers, for by grace divine and by force of\r\narms, I will raise the siege of Orleans and then lead you to your\r\nanointing at Reims, according as God hath commanded me, for it is his\r\nwill that the English return to their country and leave in peace your\r\nkingdom which shall remain unto you. Or, if they do not quit the land,\r\nthen will God cause them to perish.\" Further, they told how,\r\ninterrogated by certain prelates, knights, squires, and doctors in\r\nlaw, her bearing had been found honest and her words wise. They\r\nextolled her piety, her candour, that simplicity which testified that\r\nGod dwelt with her, and that skill in managing a horse and wielding\r\nweapons which caused all men to marvel.[862]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 862: _Journal du siege_, p. 46. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 278. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of March, tidings came, that, taken to Poitiers, she had\r\nthere been examined by doctors and famous masters, and had replied to\r\nthem with an assurance equal to that of Saint Catherine before the\r\ndoctors at Alexandria. Because her words were good and her promises\r\nsure, it was said that the King, trusting in her, had caused her to be\r\narmed in order that she might go to Orleans, where she would soon\r\nappear, riding on a white horse, wearing at her side the sword of\r\nSaint Catherine and holding in her hand the standard she had received\r\nfrom the King of Heaven.[863]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 863: _Journal du siege_, pp. 47, 48. P. Mantellier,\r\n_Histoire du siege_, pp. 61 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nTo the ecclesiastics what was told of Jeanne seemed marvellous but not\r\nincredible, since parallel instances were to be found in sacred\r\nhistory, which was all the history they knew. To those who were\r\nlettered among them their erudition furnished fewer reasons for denial\r\nthan for doubt or belief. Those who were simple frankly wondered at\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nCertain of the captains, and certain even of the people, treated them\r\nwith derision. But by so doing they ran the risk of ill usage. The\r\ninhabitants of the city believed in the Maid as firmly as in Our Lord.\r\nFrom her they expected help and deliverance. They summoned her in a\r\nkind of mystic ecstasy and religious frenzy. The fever of the siege\r\nhad become the fever of the Maid.[864]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 864: _Journal du siege_, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the use made of her by the King's men proved that,\r\nfollowing the counsel of the theologians, they were determined to\r\nadopt only such methods as were prompted by human prudence. She was to\r\nenter the town with a convoy of victuals, then being prepared at Blois\r\nby order of the King assisted by the Queen of Sicily.[865] In all the\r\nloyal provinces a new effort was being made for the relief and\r\ndeliverance of the brave city. Gien, Bourges, Blois, Chateaudun, Tours\r\nsent men and victuals; Angers, Poitiers, La Rochelle, Albi, Moulins,\r\nMontpellier, Clermont sulphur, saltpetre, steel, and arms.[866] And if\r\nthe citizens of Toulouse gave nothing it was because their city, as\r\nthe notables consulted by the _capitouls_[867] ingenuously declared,\r\nhad nothing to give--_non habebat de quibus_.[868]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 865: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 93. _Geste des nobles_, in _La\r\nchronique de la Pucelle_, p. 250.

Thomas, in _Annales du Midi_, 1889, p. 232. It would\r\nappear that Saint-Flour, although solicited, did not contribute: it\r\nhad enough to do to defend itself from the freebooters who were\r\nconstantly hovering round. Cf. _Villandrando et les ecorcheurs a\r\nSaint-Flour_ by M. Boudet, Clermont-Ferrand, 1895, in 8vo, pp. 18 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nThe King's councillors, notably my Lord Regnault de Chartres,\r\nChancellor of the Realm, were forming a new army. What they had failed\r\nto accomplish, by means of the men of Auvergne, they would now attempt\r\nwith troops from Anjou and Le Mans. The Queen of Sicily, Duchess of\r\nTouraine and Anjou, willingly lent her aid. Were Orleans taken she\r\nwould be in danger of losing lands by which she set great store.\r\nTherefore she spared neither men, money, nor victuals. After the\r\nmiddle of April, a citizen of Angers, one Jean Langlois, brought\r\nletters informing the magistrates of the imminent arrival of the corn\r\nshe had contributed. The town gave Jean Langlois a present, and the\r\nmagistrates entertained him at dinner at the Ecu Saint-Georges. This\r\ncorn was a part of that large convoy which the Maid was to\r\naccompany.[869]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 869: Receipts of the town of Orleans in 1429, in Boucher de\r\nMolandon, _Premiere expedition de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 36.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month, by order of my Lord the Bastard, the\r\ncaptains of the French garrisons of La Beauce and Gatinais, betook\r\nthemselves to the town to reinforce the army of Blois, the arrival of\r\nwhich was announced. On the 28th, there entered my Lord Florent\r\nd'Illiers,[870] Governor of Chateaudun, with four hundred fighting\r\nmen.[871]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 870: Florent d'Illiers, descended from an old family of the\r\nChartres country, had married Jeanne, daughter of Jean de Coutes and\r\nsister of the little page whom the Sire de Gaucourt had given the Maid\r\n(A. de Villaret).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: _Journal du siege_, p. 73. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 278.]\r\n\r\nWhat was to become of Orleans? The siege, badly conducted, was causing\r\nthe English the most grievous disappointments. Further, their captains\r\nperceived they would never succeed in taking the town by means of\r\nthose bastions, between which anything, either men, victuals, or\r\nammunition, could pass, and with an army miserably quartered in mud\r\nhovels, ravaged by disease, and reduced by desertions to three\r\nthousand, or at the most to three thousand two hundred men. They had\r\nlost nearly all their horses. Far from being able to continue the\r\nattack it was hard for them to maintain the defensive and to hold out\r\nin those miserable wooden towers, which, as Le Jouvencel said, were\r\nmore profitable to the besieged than to the besiegers.[872]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 872: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nTheir only hope, and that an uncertain and distant one, lay in the\r\nreinforcements, which the Regent was gathering with great\r\ndifficulty.[873] Meanwhile, time seemed to drag in the besieged town.\r\nThe warriors who defended it were brave, but they had come to the end\r\nof their resources and knew not what more to do. The citizens were\r\ngood at keeping guard, but they would not face fire. They did not\r\nsuspect the miserable condition to which the besiegers had been\r\nreduced. Hardship, anxiety, and an infected atmosphere depressed their\r\nspirits. Already they seemed to see _Les Coues_ taking the town by\r\nstorm, killing, pillaging, and ravaging. At every moment they believed\r\nthemselves betrayed. They were not calm and self-possessed enough to\r\nrecognise the enormous advantages of their situation. The town's means\r\nof communication, whereby it could be indefinitely reinforced and\r\nrevictualled, were still open. Besides, a relieving army, well in\r\nadvance of that of the English, was on the point of arriving. It was\r\nbringing a goodly drove of cattle, as well as men and ammunition\r\nenough to capture the English fortresses in a few days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 873: Jarry, _Le compte de l'armee anglaise_, pp. 75 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nWith this army the King was sending the Maid who had been promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT BLOIS--THE LETTER TO THE ENGLISH--THE DEPARTURE FOR\r\nORLEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an escort of soldiers of fortune the Maid reached Blois at the\r\nsame time as my Lord Regnault de Chartres, Chancellor of France, and\r\nthe Sire de Gaucourt, Governor of Orleans.[874] She was in the domain\r\nof the Prince, whom it was her great desire to deliver: the people of\r\nBlois owed allegiance to Duke Charles, a prisoner in the hands of the\r\nEnglish. Merchants were bringing cows, rams, ewes, herds of swine,\r\ngrain, powder and arms into the town.[875] The Admiral, De Culant, and\r\nthe Lord Ambroise de Lore had come from Orleans to superintend the\r\npreparations. The Queen of Sicily herself had gone to Blois.\r\nNotwithstanding that at this time the King consulted her but seldom,\r\nhe now sent to her the Duke of Alencon, commissioned to concert with\r\nher measures for the relief of the city of Orleans.[876] There came\r\nalso the Sire de Rais, of the house of Laval and of the line of the\r\nDukes of Brittany, a noble scarce twenty-four, generous and\r\nmagnificent, bringing in his train, with a goodly company from Maine\r\nand Anjou, organs for his chapel, choristers, and little singing-boys\r\nfrom the choir school.[877] The Marshal de Boussac, the Captains La\r\nHire and Poton came from Orleans.[878] An army of seven thousand men\r\nassembled beneath the walls of the town.[879] All that was now waited\r\nfor was the money necessary to pay the cost of the victuals and the\r\nhire of the soldiers. Captains and men-at-arms did not give their\r\nservices on credit. As for the merchants, if they risked the loss of\r\ntheir victuals and their life, it was only for ready money.[880] No\r\ncash, no cattle--and the wagons stayed where they were.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 874: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 875: _Journal du siege_, _passim_. _Chronique de Tournai_,\r\ned.

Surrender to the Maid sent hither by God, the King\r\n     of Heaven, the keys of all the good[883] towns in France\r\n     that you have taken and ravaged.[884] She is come here in\r\n     God's name to claim the Blood Royal.[885] She is ready to\r\n     make peace if so be you will do her satisfaction by giving\r\n     and paying back to France what you have taken from\r\n     her.[886] And you, archers, comrades-in-arms, gentle and\r\n     otherwise,[887] who are before the town of Orleans, go ye\r\n     hence into your own land, in God's name. And if you will\r\n     not, then hear the wondrous works[888] of the Maid who will\r\n     shortly come upon you to your very great hurt. And you, King\r\n     of England, if you do not thus, I am a Chieftain of\r\n     war,--and in whatsoever place in France I meet with your\r\n     men, I will force them to depart willy nilly; and if they\r\n     will not, then I will have them all slain. I am sent hither\r\n     by God, the King of Heaven, body for body, to drive them all\r\n     out of the whole of France. And if they obey, then will I\r\n     show them mercy. And think not in your heart that you will\r\n     hold the kingdom of France [from] God, the King of Heaven,\r\n     Son of the Blessed Mary, for it is King Charles, the true\r\n     heir, who shall so hold it. God, the King of Heaven, so\r\n     wills it, and he hath revealed it unto King Charles by the\r\n     Maid. With a goodly company the King shall enter Paris. If\r\n     ye will not believe these wondrous works wrought by God and\r\n     the Maid, then, in whatsoever place ye shall be, there shall\r\n     we fight. And if ye do me not right, there shall be so great\r\n     a noise as hath not been in France for a thousand years. And\r\n     know ye that the King of Heaven will send such great power\r\n     to the Maid, to her and to her good soldiers, that ye will\r\n     not be able to overcome her in any battle; and in the end\r\n     the God of Heaven will reveal who has the better right. You,\r\n     Duke of Bedfort, the Maid prays and beseeches you that you\r\n     bring not destruction upon yourself. If you do her right,\r\n     you may come in her company where the French will do the\r\n     fairest deed ever done for Christendom. And if ye will have\r\n     peace in the city of Orleans, then make ye answer; and, if\r\n     not, then remember it will be to your great hurt and that\r\n     shortly.

Here we must interpret the terms\r\n_comrades_ and _gentle_ according to their true meaning and not\r\nconsider them as used ironically, as in the following passage from\r\nFroissart: \"_Il (le duc de Lancastre) entendit comme il pourroit estre\r\nsaisy de quatre gentils compaignons qui estrangle avoyent son oncle,\r\nle duc de Glocestre, au chasteau de Calais._\" \"He (the Duke of\r\nLancaster) realised how he might be seized by the four gentle comrades\r\nwho had strangled his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, in the Castle of\r\nCalais.\" (Froissart in La Curne.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 888: French. _Attendez les nouvelles de la Pucelle_ and\r\nfurther on: _Si vous ne voules croire lez nouvelles de par Dieu de la\r\nPucelle...._ This word _Nouvelles_ then as now meant _tidings_, but it\r\nalso had a sense of _marvels_ as in the following phrase: \"_En celle\r\nannee apparurent maintes nouvelles a Rosay en Brie; le vin fut mue en\r\nsang et le pain en chair sensiblement ou (au) sacrement de l'autel._\"\r\n(\"In that year many _marvels_ were wrought at Rosay in Brie; the wine\r\nwas turned to blood and the bread to flesh visibly at the sacrament of\r\nthe altar.\") (_Chroniques de Saint Denys_, in La Curne.)]\r\n\r\nSuch is the letter. It was written in a new spirit; for it proclaimed\r\nthe kingship of Jesus Christ and declared a holy war. It is hard to\r\ntell whether it proceeded from Jeanne's own inspiration or was\r\ndictated to her by the council of ecclesiastics. On first thoughts one\r\nmight be inclined to attribute to the priests the idea of a summons,\r\nwhich is a literal application of the precepts of Deuteronomy:\r\n\r\n\"When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim\r\npeace unto it.\r\n\r\n\"And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee,\r\nthen it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be\r\ntributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.\r\n\r\n\"And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against\r\nthee, then thou shalt besiege it:\r\n\r\n\"And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou\r\nshalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:\r\n\r\n\"But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is\r\nin the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto\r\nthyself.\" (Deuteronomy xx, 10-14.)\r\n\r\nBut at least it is certain that on this occasion the Maid is\r\nexpressing her own sentiments. Afterwards we shall find her saying: \"I\r\nasked for peace, and when I was refused I was ready to fight.\"[889]\r\nBut, as she dictated the letter and was unable to read it, we may ask\r\nwhether the clerks who held the pen did not add to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 889: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 55, 84, 240.]\r\n\r\nTwo or three passages suggest the ecclesiastical touch. Afterwards the\r\nMaid did not remember having dictated \"body for body,\" which is quite\r\nunimportant. But she declared that she had not said: \"I am chief in\r\nwar\" and that she had dictated: \"Surrender to the King\" and not\r\n\"Surrender to the Maid.\"[890] Possibly her memory failed her; it was\r\nnot always faithful. Nevertheless she appeared very certain of what\r\nshe said, and twice she repeated that \"chief in war\" and \"surrender to\r\nthe Maid\" were not in the letter. It may have been that the monks who\r\nwere with her used these expressions. To these wandering priests a\r\ndispute over fiefs mattered little, and it was not their first concern\r\nto bring King Charles into the possession of his inheritance.\r\nDoubtless they desired the good of the kingdom of France; but\r\ncertainly they desired much more the good of Christendom; and we shall\r\nsee that, if those mendicant monks, Brother Pasquerel and later Friar\r\nRichard, follow the Maid, it will be in the hope of employing her to\r\nthe Church's advantage. Thus it would be but natural that they should\r\ndeclare her at the outset commander in war, and even invest her with a\r\nspiritual power superior to the temporal power of the King, and\r\nimplied in the phrase: \"Surrender to the Maid ... the keys of the good\r\ntowns.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 890: _Ibid._, pp. 55, 56, 84.]\r\n\r\nThis very letter indicates one of those hopes which among others she\r\ninspired. They expected that after she had fulfilled her mission in\r\nFrance, she would take the cross and go forth to conquer Jerusalem,\r\nbringing all the armies of Christian Europe in her train.[891] At this\r\nvery time a disciple of Bernardino of Siena, Friar Richard, a\r\nFranciscan lately come from Syria,[892] and who was shortly to meet\r\nthe Maid, was preaching at Paris, announcing the approach of the end\r\nof the world, and exhorting the faithful to fight against\r\nAntichrist.[893] It must be remembered that the Turks, who had\r\nconquered the Christian knights at Nicopolis and at Semendria, were\r\nthreatening Constantinople and spreading terror throughout Europe.\r\nPopes, emperors, kings felt the necessity of making one great effort\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 891: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 64, 82 _et seq._ Christine de\r\nPisan, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p. 16.

See the pictures in the\r\nnumerous fifteenth century little popular books concerning Antichrist.\r\n(Brunet, _Manuel du libraire_, vol. i, col. 316.)]\r\n\r\nIn England it was said that between Saint-Denys and Saint-George there\r\nhad been born to King Henry V and Madame Catherine of France a boy,\r\nhalf English and half French, who would go to Egypt and pluck the\r\nGrand Turk's beard.[894] On his death-bed the conqueror Henry V was\r\nlistening to the priests repeating the penitential psalms. When he\r\nheard the verse: _Benigne fac Domine in bona voluntate tua ut\r\naedificentur muri Jerusalem_, he murmured with his dying breath: \"I\r\nhave always intended to go to Syria and deliver the holy city out of\r\nthe hand of the infidel.\"[895] These were his last words. Wise men\r\ncounselled Christian princes to unite against the Crescent. In France,\r\nthe Archbishop of Embrun, who had sat in the Dauphin's Council, cursed\r\nthe insatiable cruelty of the English nation and those wars among\r\nChristians which were an occasion of rejoicing to the enemies of the\r\nCross of Christ.[896]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 894: Felix Rabbe, _Jeanne d'Arc en Angleterre_, Paris, 1891,\r\np. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 895: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 112.

Marcellin Fornier, _Histoire des Alpes, Maritimes\r\nou Cottiennes_, vol. ii, pp. 315 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nTo summon the English and French to take the cross together, was to\r\nproclaim that after ninety-one years of violence and crime the cycle\r\nof secular warfare had come to an end. It was to bid Christendom\r\nreturn to the days when Philippe de Valois and Edward Plantagenet\r\npromised the Pope to join together against the infidel.\r\n\r\nBut when the Maid invited the English to unite with the French in a\r\nholy and warlike enterprise, it is not difficult to imagine with what\r\nkind of a reception the _Godons_ would greet such an angelic summons.\r\nAnd at the time of the siege of Orleans, the French on their side had\r\ngood reasons for not taking the cross with the _Coues_.[897]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 897: In all extant copies of the Letter to the English,\r\nexcept that of the Trial, at the passage \"you may come\" [_Encore que\r\npourrez venir_] the text is completely illegible.]\r\n\r\nThe learned did not greatly appreciate the style of this letter. The\r\nBastard of Orleans thought the words very simple; and a few years\r\nlater a good French jurist pronounced it coarse, heavy, and badly\r\narranged.[898] We cannot aspire to judge better than the jurist and\r\nthe Bastard, both men of erudition. Nevertheless, we wonder whether it\r\nwere not that her manner of expression seemed bad to them, merely\r\nbecause it differed from the style of legal documents. True it is that\r\nthe letter from Blois indicates the poverty of the French prose of\r\nthat time when not enriched by an Alain Chartier; but it contains\r\nneither term nor expression which is not to be met with in the good\r\nauthors of the day. The words may not be correctly ordered, but the\r\nstyle is none the less vivacious. There is nothing to suggest that the\r\nwriter came from the banks of the Meuse; no trace is there of the\r\nspeech of Lorraine or Champagne.[899] It is clerkly French.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 898: _Per unam litteram suo materno idiomate confectam,\r\nverbis bene simplicibus_, _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 7, evidence of the\r\nBastard of Orleans.

E.\r\nLanglois.)]\r\n\r\nWhile Isabelle de Vouthon had gone on a pilgrimage to Puy, her two\r\nyoungest children, Jean and Pierre, had set out for France to join\r\ntheir sister, with the intention of making their fortunes through her\r\nor the King. Likewise, Brother Nicolas of Vouthon, Jeanne's cousin\r\ngerman, a monk in priest's orders in the Abbey of Cheminon, joined the\r\nyoung saint.[900] To have thus attracted her kinsfolk before giving\r\nany sign of her power, Jeanne must have had witnesses on the banks of\r\nthe Meuse; and certain venerable ecclesiastical personages, as well as\r\nnoble lords of Lorraine, must have answered for her reputation in\r\nFrance. Such guarantors of the truth of her mission were doubtless\r\nthose who had instructed her in and accredited her by prophecy.\r\nPerhaps Brother Nicolas of Vouthon was himself of the number.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 900: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 252.

[Document of very doubtful authenticity.]]\r\n\r\nIn the army she was regarded as a holy maiden. Her company consisted\r\nof a chaplain, Brother Jean Pasquerel;[901] two pages, Louis de Coutes\r\nand Raymond;[902] her two brethren, Pierre and Jean; two heralds,\r\nAmbleville and Guyenne;[903] two squires, Jean de Metz and Bertrand de\r\nPoulengy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 901: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 902: _Ibid._, pp. 65, 67, 124. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n277.

A squire, one Jean d'Aulon,\r\nwhom the King gave her for a steward, joined her at Blois.[905] He\r\nwas the poorest squire of the realm. He was entirely dependent on the\r\nSire de La Tremouille, who lent him money; but he was well known for\r\nhis honour and his wisdom.[906] Jeanne attributed the defeats of the\r\nFrench to their riding forth accompanied by bad women and to their\r\ntaking God's holy name in vain. And this opinion, far from being held\r\nby her alone, prevailed among persons of learning and religion;\r\naccording to whom the disaster of Nicopolis was occasioned by the\r\npresence of prostitutes in the army, and by the cruelty and\r\ndissoluteness of the knights.[907]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 904: Extracts from the Accounts of Hemon Raguier, _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 257, 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 905: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 211.

The decrees embodying this prohibition\r\nasserted that wars, pestilence, and famine were caused by blasphemy\r\nand that the blasphemers were in part responsible for the sufferings\r\nof the realm.[908] Wherefore the Maid went among the men-at-arms,\r\nexhorting them to turn away the women who followed the army, and to\r\ncease taking the Lord's name in vain. She besought them to confess\r\ntheir sins and receive divine grace into their souls, maintaining that\r\ntheir God would aid them and give them the victory if their souls were\r\nright.[909]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 908: _Ordonnances des rois de France_, vol. xi, p. 105; vol.\r\nxiii, p. 247.

Very early she was mentioned in connection with La\r\nHire, the most valiant of the French, and it was imagined that she\r\ntaught him to confess and to cease swearing. These are pretty stories\r\n(_Trial_, vol. iii, p. 32; vol. iv, p. 327).]\r\n\r\nJeanne took her standard to the Church of Saint-Sauveur and gave it to\r\nthe priests to bless.[910] The little company formed at Tours was\r\njoined at Blois by ecclesiastics and monks, who, on the approach of\r\nthe English, had fled in crowds from the neighbouring abbeys, and were\r\nnow suffering from cold and hunger. It was generally thus. Monks were\r\nfor ever flocking to the armies. Many churches and most abbeys had\r\nbeen reduced to ruin. Those of the mendicants, built outside the\r\ntowns, had all perished,--plundered and burnt by the English or pulled\r\ndown by the townsfolk; for, when threatened with siege, the\r\ninhabitants always dealt thus with the outlying portions of their\r\ntown. The homeless monks found no welcome in the cities, which were\r\nsparing of their goods; they must needs take the field with the\r\nsoldiers and follow the army. From such a course their rule suffered\r\nand piety gained nothing. Among mercenaries, sumpters and camp\r\nfollowers, these hungry nomad monks lived an edifying life. Those who\r\naccompanied the Maid were doubtless neither worse nor better than the\r\nrest, and as they were very hungry their first care was to eat.[911]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 910: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 103.

It is true\r\nthat the damsel was said to work wonders. Many believed in them;\r\nothers mocked and said aloud: \"Behold the brave champion and captain\r\nwho comes to deliver the realm of France.\"[912]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 912: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 327. Tringant, _Le Jouvencel_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 277, merely says that few soldiers went willingly to the\r\nrelief of Orleans, which is not strictly accurate.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid had a banner made for the monks to assemble beneath and\r\nsummon the men-at-arms to prayer. This banner was white, and on it\r\nwere represented Jesus on the Cross between Our Lady and Saint\r\nJohn.[913] The Duke of Alencon went back to the King to make known to\r\nhim the needs of the company at Blois. The King sent the necessary\r\nfunds; and at length they were ready to set out.[914] At the start\r\nthere were two roads open, one leading to Orleans along the right bank\r\nof the Loire, the other along the left bank. At the end of twelve or\r\nfourteen miles the road along the right bank came out on the edge of\r\nthe Plain of La Beauce, occupied by the English who had garrisons at\r\nMarchenoir, Beaugency, Meung, Montpipeau, Saint-Sigismond, and\r\nJanville. In that direction lay the risk of meeting the army, which\r\nwas coming to the aid of the English round Orleans. After the\r\nexperience of the Battle of the Herrings such a meeting was to be\r\nfeared. If the road along the left bank were taken, the march would\r\nlie through the district of La Sologne, which still belonged to King\r\nCharles; and if the river were left well on one side, the army would\r\nbe out of sight of the English garrisons of Beaugency and of Meung.\r\nTrue, it would involve crossing the Loire, but by going up the river\r\nfive miles east of the besieged city a crossing could conveniently be\r\neffected between Orleans and Jargeau. On due deliberation it was\r\ndecided that they should go by the left bank through La Sologne. It\r\nwas decided to take in the victuals in two separate lots for fear the\r\nunloading near the enemy's bastions should take too long.[915] On\r\nWednesday, the 27th of April, they started.[916] The priests in\r\nprocession, with a banner at their head, led the march, singing the\r\n_Veni creator Spiritus_.[917] The Maid rode with them in white armour,\r\nbearing her standard. The men-at-arms and the archers followed,\r\nescorting six hundred wagons of victuals and ammunition and four\r\nhundred head of cattle.[918] The long line of lances, wagons, and\r\nherds defiled over the Blois bridge into the vast plain beyond. The\r\nfirst day the army covered twenty miles of rutty road. Then at\r\ncurfew, when the setting sun, reflected in the Loire, made the river\r\nlook like a sheet of copper between lines of dark reeds, it\r\nhalted,[919] and the priests sang _Gabriel angelus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 913: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 104 (Brother Pasquerel's\r\nevidence). _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 281.

Jeanne, who had not been\r\nwilling to take off her armour, awoke aching in every limb.[920] She\r\nheard mass and received communion from her chaplain, and exhorted the\r\nmen-at-arms always to confess their sins.[921] Then the army resumed\r\nits march towards Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 920: _Ibid._, p. 67 (evidence of Louis de Coutes).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 921: _Ibid._, p. 67.

The army descended the slopes towards the\r\nLoire and stopped at the Bouchet wharf, while the carts and the cattle\r\ncontinued their way along the bank as far as l'Ile-aux-Bourdons,\r\nopposite Checy, two and a half miles further up the river.[922] There\r\nthe unloading was to take place. At a signal from the watchmen my Lord\r\nthe Bastard, accompanied by Thibaut de Termes and certain other\r\ncaptains, left the town by the Burgundian Gate, took a boat at\r\nSaint-Jean-de-Braye, and came down to hold counsel with the Lords de\r\nRais and de Lore, who commanded the convoy.[923]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 922: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 4, 5.

Sorrow and wrath possessed her. She had been misled, that was\r\ncertain. But had it been done on purpose? Had they really intended to\r\ndeceive her? It is said that she had expressed a wish to go through La\r\nBeauce and not through La Sologne, and that she had received the\r\nanswer: \"Jeanne, be reassured; we will take you through La\r\nBeauce.\"[925] Is it possible? Why should the barons have thus trifled\r\nwith the holy damsel, whom the King had confided to their care, and\r\nwho already inspired most of them with respect? Certain of them, it is\r\ntrue, believing her not to be in earnest, would willingly have turned\r\nher to ridicule; but if one of them had played her the trick of\r\nrepresenting La Beauce as La Sologne, how was it there was no one to\r\nundeceive her? How could Brother Pasquerel, her chaplain, her steward,\r\nand the honest squire d'Aulon, have become the accomplices of so\r\nclumsy a jest? It is all very mysterious, and, when one comes to think\r\nof it, what is most mysterious is that Jeanne should have expressly\r\nasked to go to Orleans through La Beauce. Since she was so ignorant of\r\nthe way that when crossing the Blois bridge she never suspected that\r\nshe was going into La Sologne, there is not much likelihood of her\r\nrealising so exactly the lie of Orleans as to choose between entering\r\nit from the south or the west. A damsel knowing naught beyond the name\r\nof the gate through which she is to enter the city, and who is yet\r\npersuaded by malicious captains to take one road rather than another,\r\nsounds too much like a Mother Goose's tale.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 924: \"_Et cuidoit bien qu'ils deussent passer par devers les\r\nbastides du siege devers la Beausse._\" _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 925: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 285 (the Chronicle here\r\namplifies the evidence of Dunois, vol. iii, p. 67).]\r\n\r\nJeanne knew no more of Orleans than she did of Babylon. We may\r\ntherefore conjecture that there was a misunderstanding. She had spoken\r\nneither of Sologne nor of Beauce. Her Voices had told her that the\r\nEnglish would not budge. They had not shown her a picture of the town,\r\nthey had not given her either maps or plans: soldiers did not use\r\nthem. Doubtless Jeanne had said to the captains and priests what she\r\nwas soon to repeat to the Bastard: \"I must go to Talbot and the\r\nEnglish.\" And the priests and soldiers had replied quite frankly:\r\n\"Jeanne, we are going to Talbot and the English.\"[926] They had\r\nthought they were speaking the truth, since Talbot, who was conducting\r\nthe siege, would be before them, so to speak, from whatever side they\r\napproached the town. But apparently they had not thoroughly understood\r\nwhat the Maid said, and the Maid had not understood what they had\r\nreplied. For now she was angry and sad at finding herself separated\r\nfrom the town by the sands and waters of the river. What was there to\r\nvex her in this? Those who were with her then did not discover; and\r\nperhaps her reasons were misunderstood because they were spiritual and\r\nmystic. She certainly could not have judged that a military mistake\r\nhad been made by the bringing of troops and victuals through La\r\nSologne. As she did not know the roads, it was impossible for her to\r\ntell which was the best. She was ignorant alike of the enemy's\r\nposition, of the outworks of the besiegers, and of the defences of the\r\nbesieged. She had just learnt on what bank of the river the town was\r\nsituated, yet she must have thought she had good ground for complaint;\r\nfor she approached the Lord Bastard and inquired sharply: \"Are you the\r\nBastard of Orleans?\" \"I am he. I rejoice at your coming.\" \"Was it\r\nthrough your counsel that I came hither on this side of the river, and\r\nthat I did not go straight to where Talbot and the English are?\" \"It\r\nwas I and those wiser than I who gave this counsel, believing we acted\r\nfor the best and for the greatest safety.\" But Jeanne retorted: \"In\r\nGod's name! Messire's counsel is better and wiser than yours. You\r\nthought to deceive me, but you deceive yourselves. For I bring you\r\nsurer aid than ever came yet to knight or city; it is the aid of the\r\nKing of Heaven and comes from God himself, who not merely for my sake\r\nbut at the prayer of Saint Louis and Saint Charlemagne has had pity\r\nupon the town of Orleans, and will not suffer the enemy to hold at\r\nonce both the body and the city of the Duke.\"[927]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 926: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 5, 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 927: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 5, 6. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 284. Boucher de Molandon, _Premiere expedition de Jeanne d'Arc_, p.\r\n49.]\r\n\r\nOne may conclude that what really vexed her was that she had not been\r\ntaken straight to Talbot and the English. She had just heard that\r\nTalbot with his camp was on the right bank. And when she spoke of\r\nTalbot and the English she meant only those English who were with\r\nTalbot. For, as she came down into the Loire valley, near the ford of\r\nSaint-Jean-le-Blanc, she must have seen the bastion of Les Augustins\r\nand Les Tourelles at the end of the bridge; and she must have known\r\nthat there were also English on the left bank. But still, it is not\r\nclear why she should have desired to appear first before Talbot and\r\nhis English, and why she was now so annoyed at being separated from\r\nhim by the Loire. Did she think that the entrenched camp,\r\nSaint-Laurent-des-Orgerils, commanded by Scales, Suffolk, and Talbot\r\nwould be attacked immediately? Such an idea would never of itself\r\nhave occurred to her, since she did not know the place, and no soldier\r\nwould ever have put such madness into her head as an attack on an\r\nentrenched camp by a convoy of cattle and wagons. Neither, as has so\r\noften been asserted, can she have thought of forcing a passage between\r\nthe bastion Saint-Pouair and the outskirts of the wood, since of the\r\nbastions and of the forest she knew as little as of the rest. If such\r\nhad been her intention she would have announced it plainly to the\r\nBastard; for she knew how to make her meaning clear, and even educated\r\npersons considered that she spoke well. Then what was her idea? It is\r\nnot impossible to discover it if one remembers what must have been in\r\nthe saint's mind at that time, or if one merely recollects by what\r\nwords and deeds Jeanne had announced and prepared her mission. She had\r\nsaid to the doctors of Poitiers: \"The siege of Orleans shall be raised\r\nand the town delivered from the enemy after I have summoned it to\r\nsurrender in God's name.\"[928] In the name of the King of Heaven she\r\nhad called upon Scales, Suffolk, and Talbot to raise the siege. She\r\nhad written that she was ready to make peace, and had bidden them\r\nreturn to England. Now she asked Talbot, Suffolk, and Scales for an\r\nanswer. Since the English had not sent back her herald she herself\r\ncame to their leaders as the herald of Messire. She came to require\r\nthem to make peace, and if they would not make peace she was ready to\r\nfight. It was not until they had refused that she could be certain of\r\nconquering, not for any human reason, but because her Council had so\r\npromised her. Perhaps even she may have hoped that by appearing to the\r\nEnglish captains, her standard in hand, accompanied by Saint\r\nCatherine and Saint Margaret and Saint Michael the Archangel, she\r\nwould persuade them to leave France. She may have believed that\r\nTalbot, falling on his knees, would obey not her, but Him who sent\r\nher; that thus she would accomplish that for which she came, without\r\nshedding one drop of that French blood which was so dear to her;\r\nneither would the English whom she pitied lose their bodies or their\r\nsouls. In any case God must be obeyed and charity shown: it was only\r\nat such a price that victory could be gained. A victory so spiritual,\r\na conquest so angelic, she had come to win; but now it was snatched\r\nfrom her by the false wisdom of the leaders of her party. They were\r\nhindering her from fulfilling her mission,--perhaps from giving the\r\npromised sign,--and they were involving her with themselves in\r\nenterprises less certain of success and less noble in spirit. Hence\r\nher sorrow and her wrath.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 928: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 273.]\r\n\r\nEven after the discomfiture of her arrival, in order that she might\r\nplease God, she did not consider herself freed from the obligation of\r\noffering peace to her enemies.[929] And since she could not go\r\nstraight to Talbot's camp she wanted to appear before the fort of\r\nSaint-Jean-le-Blanc.[930]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 929: Opinion of Martin Berruyer, in Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires\r\net consultations_, ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 930: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 78, 214.]\r\n\r\nThere was no one left behind the palisades. But if she had gone and\r\nfound any of the enemy there she would first have offered them peace.\r\nOf this her subsequent behaviour within the city walls is positive\r\nproof. Her mission was not to contribute to the defence of Orleans\r\nplans of campaign or stratagems of war; her share in the work of\r\ndeliverance was higher and nobler. To suffering men, weak, unhappy,\r\nand selfish, she brought the invincible forces of love and faith, the\r\nvirtue of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMy Lord the Bastard who regarded Jeanne's mission as purely religious,\r\nand who would have been greatly astonished had any one told him that\r\nhe ought to consult this peasant on military matters,[931] appeared as\r\nif he did not understand the reproaches she addressed to him. And he\r\nwent away to see that operations were carried out according to the\r\nplans he had made.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 931: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nEverything had been carefully concerted and prepared, but a slight\r\nobstacle occurred. The barges that the people of Orleans were to send\r\nfor the victuals were not yet unmoored.[932] They were sailing\r\nvessels, and, as the wind was blowing from the east, they could not\r\nset out. No one knew how long they would be delayed, and time was\r\nprecious. Jeanne said confidently to those who were growing anxious:\r\n\"Wait a little, for in God's name everything shall enter the\r\ntown.\"[933]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 932: _Ibid._, p. 78. _Journal du siege_, pp. 74, 75.\r\n_Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 933: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 105. _Chronique du la Pucelle_,\r\np. 284.]\r\n\r\nShe was right. The wind changed: the sails were unfurled, and the\r\nbarges were borne up the river by a favourable wind, so strong that\r\none boat was able to tow two or three others.[934] Without hindrance\r\nthey passed the Saint-Loup bastion. My Lord the Bastard sailed in one\r\nof these boats with Nicole de Giresme, Grand Prior of France of the\r\norder of Rhodes. And the flotilla came to the port of Checy, where it\r\nremained at anchor all night.[935] It was decided that the relieving\r\narmy should that night encamp at the port of Bouchet and guard the\r\nconvoy by watching down the river, while one detachment was stationed\r\nnear the Islands of Checy to watch up the river in the direction of\r\nJargeau. In company with certain captains, and with a body of\r\nmen-at-arms and archers, the Maid followed the bank as far as\r\nl'Ile-aux-Bourdons.[936]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 934: Boucher de Molandon, _La delivrance d'Orleans et\r\nl'institution de la fete du 8 mai, Chronique anonyme du XV'e\r\nsiecle_, Orleans, 1883, in 8vo, pp. 28, 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 935: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 6. _Journal du siege_, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 936: _Chronique de la fete_, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p. 290.\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 23, note 5. Boucher de Molandon, _Premiere\r\nexpedition de Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 52-56.]\r\n\r\nThe lords who had brought the convoy decided that they would set out\r\nimmediately after the unloading. Having accomplished the first part of\r\nits task, the army would return to Blois to fetch the remaining\r\nvictuals and ammunition, for everything had not been brought at once.\r\nHearing that the soldiers, with whom she had come, were going away,\r\nJeanne wished to go with them; and, after having so urgently asked to\r\nbe taken to Orleans, now that she was before the gates of the city,\r\nher one idea was to go back.[937] Thus is the soul of the mystic blown\r\nhither and thither by the breath of the Spirit. Now as always Jeanne\r\nwas guided by impulses purely spiritual. She would not be parted from\r\nthese soldiers because she believed they had made their peace with\r\nGod, and she feared that she might not find others as contrite. For\r\nher, victory or defeat depended absolutely on whether the combatants\r\nwere in a state of grace or of sin. To lead them to confession was her\r\nonly art of war; no other science did she know, whether for fighting\r\nbehind ramparts or in the open field.[938]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 937: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 285. This document very\r\nuntrustworthy as a whole is in certain passages a better authority\r\nthan _Le journal du siege_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 938: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 104, 105 (Pasquerel's\r\nevidence).]\r\n\r\n\"As for entering the town,\" she said, \"it would hurt me to leave my\r\nmen, and I ought not to do it. They have all confessed, and in their\r\ncompany I should not fear the uttermost power of the English.\"[939]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 939: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 284, 285.]\r\n\r\nIn reality, as one may well imagine, whether or no they had confessed,\r\nwhether they were near or far from her, these mercenaries committed\r\nall the sins compatible with the simplicity of their minds. But the\r\ninnocent damsel did not see them. Sensitive to things invisible, her\r\neyes were closed to things material.\r\n\r\nShe was confirmed in her resolution to return to Blois by the captains\r\nwho had brought her and who wanted to take her back, alleging the\r\nKing's command. They wished to keep her because she brought good luck.\r\nMy Lord the Bastard, however, saw serious obstacles and even dangers\r\nin the way of her return.[940] In the state in which he had left the\r\npeople of Orleans, if their Maid were not straightway brought before\r\nthem they would rise in fury and despair, with cries, threats,\r\nrioting, and violence; everything was to be feared, even massacres. He\r\nentreated the captains, in the King's interest, to agree to Jeanne's\r\nentering Orleans; and without great difficulty, he induced them to\r\nreturn to Blois without her. But Jeanne did not give in so quickly. He\r\nbesought her to decide to cross the Loire. She refused and with such\r\ninsistence that he must have realised how difficult it is to influence\r\na saint. It was necessary for one of the lords who had brought her,\r\nthe Sire de Rais or the Sire de Lore, to join his entreaties to those\r\nof the Bastard, and to say to her: \"Assuredly you must go, for we\r\npromise to return to you shortly.\"[941]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 940: \"_Ex tunc dictus deponens habuit bonam spem de ea et\r\nplus quam ante_,\" _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 941: _Timens ne recedere vellent et quod opus remaneret\r\nimperfectum_, _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 78. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n286. _Chronique de la fete_, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p. 285. Boucher\r\nde Molandon, _Premiere expedition de Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 61, 62.]\r\n\r\nAt last, when she heard that Brother Pasquerel would go with them to\r\nBlois, accompanied by the priests and bearing her standard, believing\r\nthat her men would have a good spiritual director, she consented to\r\nstay.[942] She crossed the Loire with her brothers, her little\r\ncompany, the Bastard, the Marshal de Boussac, the Captain La Hire, and\r\nreached Checy, which was then quite a town, with two churches, an\r\ninfirmary, and a lepers' hospital.[943] She was received by a rich\r\nburgess, one Guy de Cailly, in whose manor of Reuilly she passed the\r\nnight.[944]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 942: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 105. _Mistere du siege_, line\r\n11,616.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 943: Boucher de Molandon, _Premiere expedition de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, pp. 62, 99, note xiv, and in _Bulletin de la Societe\r\narcheologique de l'Orleanais_, vol. iv, p. 429; vol. ix, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 944: _Journal du siege_, p. 75.

The birches and osiers of l'Ile-aux-Boeufs hid\r\nthem from the English in the Saint-Loup bastion. Besides, at that\r\nmoment, the enemy was occupied elsewhere. The town garrison was\r\nskirmishing with them in order to distract their attention. The\r\nfighting was somewhat hard. There were slain and wounded; prisoners\r\nwere taken on both sides; and the English lost a banner.[947] Beneath\r\nthe deserted[948] watch of Saint-Jean-le-Blanc the barges passed\r\nunprotected. Between l'Ile-aux-Boeufs and the Islet of Les Martinets\r\nthey turned starboard, to go down again, following the right bank,\r\nunder l'Ile-aux-Toiles, as far as La Tour Neuve, the base of which was\r\nwashed by the Loire, at the south-eastern corner of the town. Then\r\nthey took shelter in the moat near the Burgundian Gate.[949]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 945: _Journal du siege_, pp. 75, 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 946: Boucher de Molandon, _Premiere expedition de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 947: _Chronique de la Fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 948: _Journal du siege_, pp. 74, 75.

It was six o'clock in the evening before she\r\nleft Checy. The captains wanted her to enter the town at nightfall for\r\nfear of disorders and lest the crush around her should be too\r\ngreat.[950] Doubtless they passed along the broad valleys leading from\r\nSemoy towards the south, on the borders of the parishes of Saint-Marc\r\nand Saint-Jean-de-Braye. On the way she said to those who rode with\r\nher: \"Fear nothing. No harm shall happen to you.\"[951] And indeed the\r\nonly danger was for pedestrians. Horsemen ran little risk of being\r\npursued by the English, who were short of horses in their bastions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 950: _Journal du siege_, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 951: _Ibid._, p. 76.]\r\n\r\nOn that Friday, the 29th of April, in the darkness, she entered\r\nOrleans, by the Burgundian Gate. She was in full armour and rode a\r\nwhite horse.[952] A white horse was the steed of heralds and\r\narchangels.[953] The Bastard had placed her on his right. Before her\r\nwas borne her standard, on which figured two angels, each holding a\r\nflower de luce, and her pennon, painted with the picture of the\r\nAnnunciation. Then came the Marshal de Boussac, Guy de Cailly, Pierre\r\nand Jean d'Arc, Jean de Metz, and Bertrand de Poulengy, the Sire\r\nd'Aulon, and those lords, captains, men-of-war, and citizens who had\r\ncome to meet her at Checy.[954] Bearing torches and rejoicing as\r\nheartily as if they had seen God himself descending among them, the\r\ntownfolk of Orleans pressed around her.[955] They had suffered great\r\nprivations, they had feared that help would never come; but now they\r\nwere heartened and felt as if the siege had been raised already by the\r\ndivine virtue, which they had been told resided in this Maid. They\r\nlooked at her with love and veneration; elbowing and pushing each\r\nother, men, women, and children rushed forward to touch her and her\r\nwhite horse, as folk touch the relics of saints. In the crush a torch\r\nset her pennon on fire. The Maid, beholding it, spurred on her horse\r\nand galloped to the flame, which she extinguished with a skill\r\napparently miraculous; for everything in her was marvellous.[956]\r\nMen-at-arms and citizens, enraptured, accompanied her in crowds to the\r\nChurch of Sainte-Croix, whither she went first to give thanks, then to\r\nthe house of Jacques Boucher, where she was to lodge.[957]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 952: _Journal du siege_, pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 953: And even now trumpeters ride white horses (_Histoire de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, by Lebrun de Charmettes, 1817, in 8vo, vol. ii, p.\r\n21).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 954: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 7. _Journal du siege_, p. 76.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 287.

He was a very rich man and had\r\nmarried the daughter of one of the most influential burgesses of the\r\ncity.[958] Having stayed in the town throughout the siege, he\r\ncontributed to the defence by gifts of wheat, oats, and wine, and by\r\nadvancing funds for the purchase of ammunition and weapons. As the\r\ncare of the ramparts fell to the burgesses, it was Jacques' duty to\r\nkeep in repair and ready for defence the Renard Gate, where he dwelt,\r\nwhich was the most exposed to the English attack. His mansion, one of\r\nthe finest and largest in the town, once inhabited by Regnart or\r\nRenard, the family which had given its name to the gate, was in the\r\nRue des Talmeliers, quite near the fortifications. The captains held\r\ntheir councils of war there, when they did not meet at the house of\r\nChancellor Guillaume Cousinot in the Rue de la Rose.[959] Jacques\r\nBoucher's dwelling was doubtless well furnished with silver plate and\r\nstoried tapestry. It would appear that in one of the rooms there was\r\na picture representing three women and bearing this inscription:\r\n_Justice, Peace, Union_.[960]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 958: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 101; vol. iii, pp. 34, 68, 124 _et\r\nseq._, 211. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 285.

She had\r\nher armour taken off.[961] Jacques Boucher's wife and daughter passed\r\nthe night with her. Jeanne shared the child's bed. She was nine years\r\nold and was called Charlotte after Duke Charles, who was her father's\r\nlord.[962] It was the custom in those days for the host to share his\r\nbed with his man guest and the hostess with her woman guest. This was\r\nthe rule of courtesy; kings observed it as well as burgesses. Children\r\nwere taught how to behave towards a sleeping companion, to keep to\r\ntheir own part of the bed, not to fidget, and to sleep with their\r\nmouths shut.[963]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 961: G. Lefevre-Pontalis (_Chronique d'Antonio Morosini_,\r\nvol. iii, p. 101, note) discovers in _La chronique de la Pucelle_\r\n(xliv, p. 285) a wrong use of an incident cited by Dunois in his\r\nevidence, which must be allowed to have happened on the 7th of May, as\r\nDunois cited it (_Trial_, vol. iii, p. 9).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 962: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 34, 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 963: Franklin, _La vie privee d'autrefois_, vols. ii, xix,\r\n_passim_. H. Havard, _Dictionnaire de l'ameublement_, under the word\r\n_lit_.]\r\n\r\nThus the Duke's treasurer took the Maid into his house and entertained\r\nher at the town's expense. Jeanne's horses were stabled by a burgess\r\nnamed Jean Pillas.\r\n\r\nAs for the D'Arc brothers, they did not stay with their sister, but\r\nlodged in the house of Thevenin Villedart. The town paid all their\r\nexpenses; for example it furnished them with the shoes and gaiters\r\nthey needed and gave them a few gold crowns. Three of the Maid's\r\ncomrades, who were very destitute and came to see her at Orleans,\r\nreceived food.[964]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 964: Accounts of the fortress in _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 259,\r\n260.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the 30th of April, the town bands of Orleans were\r\nearly afoot. From morn till eve everything in the town was\r\ntopsy-turvy; the rebellion, which had been repressed so long, now\r\nbroke forth. As early as February the citizens had begun to mistrust\r\nand hate the knights;[965] now at last they shook off their yoke and\r\nbroke it.[966] Henceforth they would recognise no King's lieutenant,\r\nno governor, no lords, no generals; there was but one power and one\r\ndefence: the Maid.[967] The Maid was the people's captain. This\r\ndamsel, this shepherdess, this nun did the knights the greatest injury\r\nthey ever experienced: she reduced them to nothing. On the morning of\r\nthe 30th they must have been convinced that the popular revolution had\r\ntaken place. The town bands were waiting for the Maid to put herself\r\nat their head, and with her to march immediately against the _Godons_.\r\nThe captains endeavoured to make them understand that they must wait\r\nfor the army from Blois and the company of Marshal de Boussac, who\r\nthat night had set out to meet the army. The citizens in arms would\r\nlisten to nothing, and with loud cries clamoured for the Maid. She did\r\nnot appear. My Lord the Bastard, who was honey-tongued, had advised\r\nher to keep away.[968] This was the last advantage the leaders gained\r\nover her. And now as before, when she appeared to give way to them,\r\nshe was merely doing as she liked. As for the citizens, with the Maid\r\nor without her, they were determined to fight. The Bastard could not\r\nhinder them. They sallied forth,[969] accompanied by the Gascons of\r\nCaptain La Hire and the men of Messire Florent d'Illiers. They bravely\r\nattacked the bastion Saint-Pouair, which the English called Paris, and\r\nwhich was about eight hundred yards from the walls. They overcame the\r\noutposts and approached so close to the bastion that they were already\r\nclamouring for faggots and straw to be brought from the town to set\r\nfire to the palisades. But at the cry \"Saint George!\" the English\r\ngathered themselves together, and after a sore and sanguinary fight\r\nrepulsed the attack of the citizens and free-lances.[970]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 965: _Journal du siege_, pp. 43, 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 966: _Ibid._, pp. 78, 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 967: See the evidence of S. Charles (vol. iii, pp. 116, 117)\r\nand certain details in _La chronique de la Pucelle_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 968: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 7, 211; vol. iv, pp. 221, 222.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 250, 251, 287. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 969: _Journal du siege_, pp. 78, 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 970: _Ibid._, p. 78. _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 291, 292. Cf. Letter written from Germany, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 349.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid had known nothing of it. Sent from God, on her white horse, a\r\nmessenger armed yet peaceful, she held it neither just nor pious to\r\nfight the English before they had refused her offers of peace. On that\r\nday as before her one wish was to go in true saintly wise straight to\r\nTalbot. She asked for tidings of her letter and learnt that the\r\nEnglish captains had paid no heed to it, and had detained her herald,\r\nGuyenne.[971] This is what had happened:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 971: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 27, 108. _Journal du siege_, p.\r\n79.]\r\n\r\nThat letter, which the Bastard deemed couched in vulgar phrase,\r\nproduced a marvellous impression on the English. It filled them with\r\nfear and rage. They kept the herald who had brought it; and, although\r\nuse and custom insisted on the person of such officers being\r\nrespected, alleging that a sorceress's messenger must be a heretic,\r\nthey put him in chains, and after some sort of a trial condemned him\r\nto be burnt as the accomplice of the seductress.[972]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 972: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 284. _Trial_, vol. iii,\r\npp. 26, 27.]\r\n\r\nThey even put up the stake to which he was to be bound. And yet,\r\nbefore executing the sentence, they judged it well to consult the\r\nUniversity of Paris, as in like manner the Bishop of Beauvais was to\r\nconsult it eighteen months later.[973] Their evil disposition arose\r\nfrom fear. These unfortunates, who were treated as devils, were afraid\r\nof devils. They suspected the subtle French of being necromancers and\r\nsorcerers. They said that by repeating magic lines the Armagnacs had\r\ncompassed the death of the great King, Henry V. Fearing lest their\r\nenemies should make use of sorcery and enchantment against them, in\r\norder to protect themselves from all evil influences, they wore bands\r\nof parchment inscribed with the formulae of conjuration and called\r\n_periapts_.[974] The most efficacious of these amulets was the first\r\nchapter of the Gospel of St. John. At this time the stars were\r\nunfavourable to them, and astrologers were reading their approaching\r\nruin in the sky. Their late King, Henry V, when he was studying at\r\nOxford, had learnt there the rules of divination by the stars. For his\r\nown special use he kept in his coffers two astrolabes, one of silver\r\nand one of gold. When his queen, Catherine of France, was about to be\r\nconfined, he himself cast the horoscope of the expected child. And\r\nfurther, as there was a prophecy in England[975] which said that\r\nWindsor would lose what Monmouth had gained, he determined that the\r\nQueen should not be confined at Windsor. But destiny cannot be\r\nthwarted. The royal child was born at Windsor. His father was in\r\nFrance when he heard the tidings. He held them to be of ill omen, and\r\nsummoned Jean Halbourd of Troyes, minister general of the Trinitarians\r\nor Mathurins, \"excellent in astrology,\" who, having drawn up the\r\nscheme of nativity, could only confirm the King in his doleful\r\npresentiments.[976] And now the time had come. Windsor reigned; all\r\nwould be lost. Merlin had predicted that they would be driven out of\r\nFrance and by a Virgin utterly undone. When the Maid appeared they\r\ngrew pale with fright, and fear fell upon captains and soldiers.[977]\r\nThose whom no man could make afraid, trembled before this girl whom\r\nthey held to be a witch. They could not be expected to regard her as a\r\nsaint sent of God. The best they could think of her was that she was a\r\nvery learned sorceress.[978] To those she came to help she appeared a\r\ndaughter of God, to those she came to destroy she appeared a horrid\r\nmonster in woman's form. In this double aspect lay all her strength:\r\nangelic for the French, devilish for the English, to one and the other\r\nshe appeared invincible and supernatural.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 973: Martial de Paris, called d'Auvergne, _Vigiles de\r\nCharles VII_, ed. Coustelier, 1724, vol. i, p. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 974: La Curne, under the word _Periapt_.

Ambleville was also\r\ninstructed to tell Sir John Talbot, the Earl of Suffolk, and the Lord\r\nScales that in God's name the Maid required them to depart from France\r\nand go to England; otherwise they would suffer hurt. The English sent\r\nback Ambleville with an evil message.\r\n\r\n\"The English,\" he said to the Maid, \"are keeping my comrade to burn\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nShe made answer: \"In God's name they will do him no harm.\" And she\r\ncommanded Ambleville to return.[979]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 979: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 27. _Journal du siege_, p. 79.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 285, 286.]\r\n\r\nShe was indignant, and, no doubt, greatly disappointed. In truth, she\r\nhad never anticipated that Talbot and the leaders of the siege would\r\ngive such a welcome to a letter inspired by Saint Catherine and Saint\r\nMargaret and Saint Michael; but so broad was her charity that she was\r\nstill willing to offer peace to the English. In her innocence she may\r\nhave believed that her proclamations in God's name were misunderstood\r\nafter all. Besides, whatever happened, she was determined to go\r\nthrough with her duty to the end. At night she sallied forth from the\r\nBridge Gate and went as far as the outwork of La Belle-Croix. It was\r\nnot unusual for the two sides to address each other. La Belle-Croix\r\nwas within ear-shot of Les Tourelles. The Maid mounted the rampart and\r\ncried to the English: \"Surrender in God's name. I will grant you your\r\nlives only.\"\r\n\r\nBut the garrison and even the Captain, William Glasdale himself,\r\nhurled back at her coarse insults and horrible threats.\r\n\r\n\"Milk-maid! If ever we get you, you shall be burned alive.\"[980]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 980: _Journal du siege_, p. 79. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 290.]\r\n\r\nShe answered that it was a lie. But they were in earnest and sincere.\r\nThey firmly believed that this damsel was arming legions of devils\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 1st of May, my Lord the Bastard went to meet the army\r\nfrom Blois.[981] He knew the country; and, being both energetic and\r\ncautious, he was desirous to superintend the entrance of this convoy\r\nas he had done that of the other. He set out with a small escort. He\r\ndid not dare to take with him the Saint herself; but, in order, so to\r\nspeak, to put himself under her protection and tactfully to flatter\r\nthe piety and affections of the folk of Orleans, he took a member of\r\nher suite, her steward, Sire Jean d'Aulon.[982] Thus he grasped the\r\nfirst opportunity of showing his good will to the Maid, feeling that\r\nhenceforth nothing could be done except with her or under her\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 981: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 7. _Journal du siege_, p. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 982: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 211.]\r\n\r\nThe fervour of the citizens was not abated. That very day, in their\r\npassionate desire to see the Saint, they crowded round Jacques\r\nBoucher's house as turbulently as the pilgrims from Puy pressed into\r\nthe sanctuary of La Vierge Noire. There was a danger of the doors\r\nbeing broken in. The cries of the townsfolk reached her. Then she\r\nappeared: good, wise, equal to her mission, one born for the salvation\r\nof the people. In the absence of captains and men-at-arms, this wild\r\nmultitude only awaited a sign from her to throw itself in tumult on\r\nthe bastions and perish there. Notwithstanding the visions of war\r\nthat haunted her, that sign she did not give. Child as she was, and\r\nas ignorant of war as of life, there was that within her which turned\r\naway disaster. She led this crowd of men, not to the English bastions,\r\nbut to the holy places of the city. Down the streets she rode,\r\naccompanied by many knights and squires; men and women pressed to see\r\nher and could not gaze upon her enough. They marvelled at the manner\r\nof her riding and of her behaviour, in every point like a man-at-arms;\r\nand they would have hailed her as a veritable Saint George had they\r\nnot suspected Saint George of turning Englishman.[983]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 983: _Journal du siege_, p. 80. P. Mantellier, _Histoire du\r\nsiege_, pp. 92, 95.]\r\n\r\nThat Sunday, for the second time, she went forth to offer peace to the\r\nenemies of the kingdom. She passed out by the Renard Gate and went\r\nalong the Blois Road, through the suburbs that had been burnt down,\r\ntowards the English bastion. Surrounded by a double moat, it was\r\nplanted on a slope at the crossroads called La Croix Boissee or\r\nBuissee, because the townsfolk of Orleans had erected a cross there,\r\nwhich every Palm Sunday they dressed with a branch of box blessed by\r\nthe priest. Doubtless she intended to reach this bastion, and perhaps\r\nto go on to the camp of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils situated between La\r\nCroix Boissee and the Loire, where, as she had said, were Talbot and\r\nthe English. For she had not yet given up hope of gaining a hearing\r\nfrom the leaders of the siege. But at the foot of the hill, at a place\r\ncalled La Croix-Morin, she met some _Godons_ who were keeping watch.\r\nAnd there, in tones grave, pious, and noble, she summoned them to\r\nretreat before the hosts of the Lord. \"Surrender, and your lives shall\r\nbe spared. In God's name go back to England. If ye will not I will\r\nmake you suffer for it.\"[984]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 984: 1 May. _Journal du siege_, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nThese men-at-arms answered her with insults as those of Les Tourelles\r\nhad done. One of them, the Bastard of Granville, cried out to her:\r\n\"Would you have us surrender to a woman?\"\r\n\r\nThe French, who were with her, they dubbed pimps and infidels, to\r\nshame them for being in the company of a bad woman and a witch.[985]\r\nBut whether because they thought her magic rendered her invulnerable,\r\nor because they held it dishonourable to strike a messenger, now, as\r\non other occasions, they forbore to fire on her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 985: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 68 (evidence of Louis de\r\nCoutes).]\r\n\r\nThat Sunday, Jacquet le Prestre, the town varlet, offered the Maid\r\nwine.[986] The magistrates and citizens could not have more highly\r\nhonoured her whom they regarded as their captain. Thus they treated\r\nbarons, kings and queens when they were entertained in the city. In\r\nthose days wine was highly valued on account of its beneficent power.\r\nJeanne, when she emphasised a wish, would say: \"If I were never to\r\ndrink wine between now and Easter!...\"[987] But in reality she never\r\ndrank wine except mixed with water, and she ate little.[988]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 986: Extracts from fortress accounts, in the _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 987: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 988: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 9, 15, 18, 22, 60; vol. v, p.\r\n120. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 285. Morosini, p. 101. _Relation du\r\ngreffier de La Rochelle_, p. 337.]\r\n\r\nThroughout this time of waiting the Maid never rested for a moment. On\r\nMonday, May 2nd, she mounted her horse and rode out into the country\r\nto view the English bastions. The people followed her in crowds; they\r\nhad no fear and were glad to be near her. And when she had seen all\r\nthat she wanted, she returned to the city, to the cathedral church,\r\nwhere she heard vespers.[989]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 989: _Journal du siege_, p. 80. P. Mantellier, _Histoire du\r\nsiege_, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the 3rd of May, the day of the Invention of the Holy\r\nCross, which was the Cathedral Festival, she followed in the\r\nprocession, with the magistrates and the townsfolk. It was then that\r\nMaitre Jean de Macon, the precentor of the cathedral,[990] greeted her\r\nwith these words: \"My daughter, are you come to raise the siege?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 990: Charles Cuissard, _Notes chronologiques sur Jean de\r\nMacon_, in _Memoires de la Societe archeologique de l'Orleanais_, vol.\r\nxi, 1897, pp. 529, 545.]\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Yea, in God's name.\"[991]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 991: _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 291.\r\nLottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, p. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe people of Orleans all believed that the English round the city\r\nwere as innumerable as the stars in the sky; the notary, Guillaume\r\nGirault, expected nothing short of a miracle.[992] Jean Luillier,\r\nwoollen draper[993] by trade, thought it impossible for the citizens\r\nto hold out longer against an enemy so enormously their superior.[994]\r\nMessire Jean de Macon was likewise alarmed at the power and the\r\nnumbers of the _Godons_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 992: Note by Guill. Girault, notary in the _Trial_, vol. iv,\r\np. 282. _Journal du siege_, p. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 993: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 112, 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 994: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 24. Cf. _Ibid._, pp. 7, 8 (the\r\nevidence of Dunois amounts to much the same).]\r\n\r\n\"My daughter,\" he said to the Maid, \"their force is great and they are\r\nstrongly intrenched. It will be a difficult matter to turn them\r\nout.\"[995]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 995: _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 291.]\r\n\r\nIf notary Guillaume Girault, if draper Jean Luillier, if Messire Jean\r\nde Macon, instead of fostering these gloomy ideas, had counted the\r\nnumbers of the besieged and the besieging, they would have found that\r\nthe former were more numerous than the latter; and that the army of\r\nScales, of Suffolk, of Talbot appeared mean and feeble when compared\r\nwith the great besieging armies of the reign of King Henry V. Had they\r\nlooked a little more closely they would have perceived that the\r\nbastions, with the formidable names of London and of Paris, were\r\npowerless to prevent either corn, cattle, pigs, or men-at-arms being\r\nbrought into the city; and that these gigantic dolls were being mocked\r\nat by the dealers, who, with their beasts, passed by them daily. In\r\nshort, they would have realised that the people of Orleans were for\r\nthe moment better off than the English. But they had examined nothing\r\nfor themselves. They were content to abide by public opinion which is\r\nseldom either just or correct. The Maid did not share Messire Jean de\r\nMacon's illusions. She knew no more of the English than he did; yet\r\nbecause she was a saint, she replied tranquilly: \"With God all things\r\nare possible.\"[996] And Maitre Jean de Macon thought it well that such\r\nshould be her opinion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 996: _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 291.]\r\n\r\nWhat aggravated the trouble, the danger, and the panic of the\r\nsituation, was that the citizens believed they were betrayed. They\r\nrecollected the Count of Clermont at the Battle of the Herrings, and\r\nthey suspected the King's men of deserting them once again. After\r\nhaving done so much and spent so much they saw themselves given up to\r\nthe English. This idea made them mad.[997] There was a rumour that the\r\nMarshal de Boussac, who had started with my Lord the Bastard to meet\r\nthe second convoy of supplies, and who was to return on Tuesday the\r\n3rd, would not come back. It was said that the Chancellor of France\r\nwanted to disband the army. It was absurd. On the contrary, great\r\nefforts for the deliverance of the city were being made by the King's\r\nCouncil and that of the Queen of Sicily. But the people's brains had\r\nbeen turned by their long suffering and their terrible danger. A more\r\nreasonable fear was lest any mishap should occur on the road from\r\nBlois like that which had overtaken the force at Rouvray. The Maid's\r\ncomrades were infected with the anxieties of the townsfolk; one of\r\nthem betrayed his fears to her, but she was not affected by them. With\r\nthe radiant tranquillity of the illuminated, she said:[998] \"The\r\nMarshal will come. I am confident that no harm will happen to\r\nhim.\"[999]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 997: _Journal du siege_, pp. 51, 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 998: Beaucroix, in his evidence, says it was Jean d'Aulon\r\n(_Trial_, vol. iii, p. 79); but, according to his own testimony,\r\nd'Aulon was then following the Bastard (_Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 210).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 999: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 79. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n286. P. Mantellier, _Histoire du siege_, p. 85.]\r\n\r\nOn that day there entered into the city the little garrisons of Gien,\r\nof Chateau-Regnard, and of Montargis.[1000] But the Blois army did not\r\ncome. On the morrow, at daybreak, it was descried in the plain of La\r\nBeauce. And, indeed, the Sire de Rais and his company, escorted by the\r\nMarshal de Boussac and my Lord the Bastard, were skirting the Forest\r\nof Orleans.[1001] At these tidings the citizens must needs exclaim\r\nthat the Maid had been right in wishing to march straight against\r\nTalbot since the captains now followed the very road she had\r\nindicated. But in reality it was not just as they thought. Only one\r\npart of the Blois army had risked forcing its way between the western\r\nbastions; the convoy, with its escort, like the first convoy, was\r\ncoming through La Sologne and was to enter the town by water. Those\r\narrangements for the entrance of supplies, which, in the first\r\ninstance, had proved successful, were naturally now repeated.[1002]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1000: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1001: _Ibid._, p. 287. _Journal du siege_, p. 81.

Loiseleur, _Comptes des depenses_, ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1002: On the 4th of May, as on the 29th of April, the corn\r\nwas brought down the Loire. Indeed there exists a bill which makes\r\nmention of \"sailors who brought the corn which came from Blois on the\r\n4th day of May,\" \"_nottoniers qui amenerent les bles qui furent amenes\r\nde Blois le iiij'e jour de may_\" (Boucher de Molandon, _Premiere\r\nexpedition de Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 58, 59).]\r\n\r\nCaptain La Hire and certain other commanders, who had remained in the\r\ncity with five hundred fighting men, went out to meet the Sire de\r\nRais, the Marshal de Boussac and the Bastard. The Maid mounted her\r\nhorse and went with them. They passed through the English lines; and,\r\na little further on, having met the army, they returned to the town\r\ntogether. The priests, and among them Brother Pasquerel bearing the\r\nbanner, were the first to pass beneath the Paris bastion, singing\r\npsalms.[1003]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1003: The 4th of May, _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 105, 211.\r\n_Journal du siege_, p. 81. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 287.]\r\n\r\nJeanne dined at Jacques Boucher's house with her steward, Jean\r\nd'Aulon. When the table was cleared, the Bastard, who had come to the\r\ntreasurer's house, talked with her for a moment. He was gracious and\r\npolite, but spoke with restraint.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard on good authority,\" he remarked, \"that Fastolf is soon\r\nto join the English who are conducting the siege. He brings them\r\nsupplies and reinforcements and is already at Janville.\"\r\n\r\nAt these tidings Jeanne appeared very glad and said, laughing:\r\n\"Bastard, Bastard, in God's name, I command thee to let me know as\r\nsoon as thou shalt hear of Fastolf's arrival. For should he come\r\nwithout my knowledge, I warn thee thou shalt lose thy head.\"[1004]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1004: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 212 (Jean d'Aulon's evidence).]\r\n\r\nFar from betraying any annoyance at so rude a jest, he replied that\r\nshe need have no fear, he would let her know.[1005]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1005: _Ibid._, p. 212.]\r\n\r\nThe approach of Sir John Fastolf had already been announced on the\r\n26th of April. It was expressly in order to avoid him that the army\r\nhad come through La Sologne. It is possible that on the 4th of May the\r\ntidings of his coming had no surer foundation. But the Bastard knew\r\nsomething else. The corn of the second convoy, like that of the first,\r\nwas coming down the river. It had been resolved, in a council of war,\r\nthat in the afternoon the captains should attack the Saint-Loup\r\nbastion, and divert the English as had been done on the 29th of\r\nApril.[1006] The attack had already begun. But of this the Bastard\r\nbreathed not a word to the Maid. He held her to be the one source of\r\nstrength in the town. But he believed that in war her part was purely\r\nspiritual.[1007]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1006: _Ibid._, p. 212. _Journal du siege_, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1007: I have followed the account of Jean Chartier, vol. i,\r\np. 73 (amplified in _La chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 288), which is\r\nmore plausible than that of _Le journal du siege_.]\r\n\r\nAfter he had withdrawn, Jeanne, worn out by her morning's expedition,\r\nlay down on her bed with her hostess for a short sleep. Sire Jean\r\nd'Aulon, who was very weary, stretched himself on a couch in the same\r\nroom, thinking to take the rest he so greatly needed. But scarce had\r\nhe fallen asleep when the Maid leapt from her bed and roused him with\r\na great noise. He asked her what she wanted.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name,\" she answered in great agitation, \"my Council have\r\ntold me to go against the English; but I know not whether I am to go\r\nagainst their bastions or against Fastolf, who is bringing them\r\nsupplies.\"[1008]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1008: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 212, 213 (Jean d'Aulon's\r\nevidence).]\r\n\r\nIn her dreams she had been present at her Council, that is to say, she\r\nhad beheld her saints. She had seen Saint Catherine and Saint\r\nMargaret. There had happened to her what always happens. The saints\r\nhad told her no more than she herself knew. They had revealed to her\r\nnothing of what she needed to know. They had not informed her how, at\r\nthat very moment, the French were attacking the Saint-Loup bastion and\r\nsuffering great hurt. And the Blessed Ones had departed leaving her in\r\nerror and in ignorance of what was going on, and in uncertainty as to\r\nwhat she was to do. The good Sire d'Aulon was not the one to relieve\r\nher from her embarrassment. He, too, was excluded from the Councils of\r\nWar. Now he answered her nothing, and set to arming himself as quickly\r\nas possible. He had already begun when they heard a great noise and\r\ncries coming up from the street. From the passers-by, they gleaned\r\nthat there was fighting near Saint-Loup and that the enemy was\r\ninflicting great hurt on the French. Without staying to inquire\r\nfurther, Jean d'Aulon went straightway to his squire to have his\r\narmour put on. Almost at the same time Jeanne went down and asked:\r\n\"Where are my armourers? The blood of our folk is flowing.\"[1009]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1009: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 106.]\r\n\r\nIn the street she found Brother Pasquerel, her chaplain, with other\r\npriests, and Mugot, her page, to whom she cried: \"Ha! cruel boy, you\r\ndid not tell me that the blood of France was being shed!... In God's\r\nname, our people are hard put to it.\"[1010]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1010: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 68 (evidence of Louis de\r\nCoutes).]\r\n\r\nShe bade him bring her horse and leave the wife and daughter of her\r\nhost to finish arming her. On his return the page found her fully\r\naccoutred. She sent him to fetch her standard from her room. He gave\r\nit her through the window. She took it and spurred on her horse into\r\nthe high street, towards the Burgundian Gate, at such a pace that\r\nsparks flashed from the pavement.\r\n\r\n\"Hasten after her!\" cried the treasurer's wife.[1011]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1011: _Ibid._, p. 69.]\r\n\r\nSire d'Aulon had not seen her start. He imagined, why, it is\r\nimpossible to say, that she had gone out on foot, and, having met a\r\npage on horseback in the street, had made him dismount and give her\r\nhis horse.[1012] The Renard Gate and the Burgundian Gate were on\r\nopposite sides of the town. Jeanne, who for the last three days had\r\nbeen going up and down the streets of Orleans, took the most direct\r\nway. Jean d'Aulon and the page, who were hastily pursuing her, did not\r\ncome up with her until she had reached the gate. There they met a\r\nwounded man being brought into the town. The Maid asked his bearers\r\nwho the man was. He was a Frenchman, they replied. Then she said: \"I\r\nhave never seen the blood of a Frenchman flow without feeling my heart\r\nstand still.\"[1013]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1012: _Ibid._, p. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1013: _Ibid._, pp. 212, 213 (Jean d'Aulon's evidence).]\r\n\r\nThe Maid and Sire d'Aulon, with a few fighting men of their company,\r\npressed on through the fields to Saint-Loup. On the way they saw\r\ncertain of their party. The good squire, unaccustomed to great\r\nbattles, never remembered having seen so many fighting men at\r\nonce.[1014]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1014: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 213.]\r\n\r\nFor an hour the Sire de Rais' Bretons and the men from Le Mans had\r\nbeen skirmishing before the bastion. As the custom was those who had\r\narrived last were keeping watch.[1015] But if these combatants, who\r\nhad reached the town only that very morning, had attacked without\r\ntaking time to breathe, they must have been hard pressed. They were\r\ndoing what had been done on the 29th of April, and for the same\r\nreason:[1016] namely, occupying the English while the barges\r\ncorn-laden were coming down the river to the moat. On the top of their\r\nhigh hill, in their strong fortress, the English had easily held out\r\nalbeit they were but few; and the French King's men can hardly have\r\nbeen able to make head against them, since the Maid and Sire d'Aulon\r\nfound them scattered through the fields. She gathered them together\r\nand led them back to the attack. They were her friends: they had\r\njourneyed together: they had sung psalms and hymns together: together\r\nthey had heard mass in the fields. They knew that she brought good\r\nluck: they followed her. As she marched at their head her first idea\r\nwas a religious one. The bastion was built upon the church and convent\r\nof the Ladies of Saint-Loup. With the sound of a trumpet she had it\r\nproclaimed that nothing should be taken from the church.[1017] She\r\nremembered how Salisbury had come to a bad end for having pillaged the\r\nChurch of Notre Dame de Clery; and she desired to keep her men from\r\nan evil death.[1018] This was the first time she had seen fighting;\r\nand no sooner had she entered into the battle than she became the\r\nleader because she was the best. She did better than others, not\r\nbecause she knew more; she knew less. But her heart was nobler. When\r\nevery man thought of himself, she alone thought of others: when every\r\nman took heed to defend himself, she defended herself not at all,\r\nhaving previously offered up her life. And thus this child,--who\r\nfeared suffering and death like every human being, who knew by her\r\nVoices and her presentiments that she would be wounded,--went straight\r\non and stood beneath showers of arrows and cannon-balls on the edge of\r\nthe moat, her standard in hand, rallying her men.[1019] Through her\r\nwhat had been merely a diversion became a serious attack. The bastion\r\nwas stormed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1015: Gruel, _Chronique d'Arthur de Richemont_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1016: _Journal du siege_, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1017: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 124, 126.

Eberhard Windecke, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that the fort of Saint-Loup was being attacked, Sir John\r\nTalbot sallied forth from the camp of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils. In\r\norder to reach the threatened bastion he had some distance to go down\r\nhis lines and along the border of the forest. He set out, and on his\r\nway was reinforced by the garrisons of the western bastions. The town\r\nwatchmen observed his movements and sounded the alarm. Marshal Boussac\r\npassing through the Parisis Gate, went out to meet Talbot on the\r\nnorth, towards Fleury. The English captain was preparing to break\r\nthrough the French force when he saw a thick cloud of smoke rising\r\nover the fort Saint-Loup. He understood that the French had captured\r\nand set fire to it; and sadly he returned to the camp of\r\nSaint-Laurent-des-Orgerils.[1020]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1020: Perceval de Cagny says: \"Soon after [the arrival of\r\nthe Maid on the edge of the entrenchments] those in the fort wished to\r\nsurrender to her: she would not take them for ransom and said she\r\nwould capture them in any event, and redoubled the attack. And\r\nstraightway the fort was taken and almost all put to death.\" This is\r\nhard to believe. The English would sooner have surrendered to the\r\nhumblest menial in the Armagnac host than to the Maid: and it is not\r\nlikely that she would have refused to hold them as prisoners for\r\nransom. Besides, Perceval de Cagny has not the remotest idea of what\r\nhappened on the 4th of May. For example, he believes that the Maid\r\nopened the attack. Perceval de Cagny, pp. 144 _et seq._ _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 82. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 289. _Chronique de la\r\nfete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 294.]\r\n\r\nThe attack had lasted three hours. After the burning of the bastion\r\nthe English climbed into the church belfry. The French had difficulty\r\nin dislodging them; but they ran no danger thereby. Of prisoners, they\r\ntook two score, and the rest they slew. The Maid was very sorrowful\r\nwhen she saw so many of the enemy dead. She pitied these poor folk who\r\nhad died unconfessed.[1021] Certain _Godons_, wearing the\r\necclesiastical habit and ornaments, came to meet her. She perceived\r\nthat they were soldiers disguised in stoles and hoods taken from the\r\nsacristy of the Abbaye aux Dames. But she pretended to take them for\r\nwhat they represented themselves to be. She received them and had them\r\nconducted to her house without allowing any harm to come to them. With\r\na charitable jest she said: \"One should never question priests.\"[1022]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1021: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1022: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the fort she confessed to Brother Pasquerel, her\r\nchaplain. And she charged him to make the following announcement to\r\nall the men-at-arms: \"Confess your sins and thank God for the victory.\r\nIf you do not, the Maid will never help you more and will not remain\r\nin your company.\"[1023]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1023: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 106.]\r\n\r\nThe Saint-Loup bastion, attacked by fifteen hundred French, had been\r\ndefended by only three hundred English. That they made no vigorous\r\ndefence is indicated by the fact that only two or three Frenchmen were\r\nslain.[1024] It was not by any severe mental effort or profound\r\ncalculation that the French King's men had gained this advantage. It\r\nhad cost them little, and yet it was immense. It meant the cutting off\r\nof the besiegers' communications with Jargeau: it meant the opening of\r\nthe upper Loire: it was the first step towards the raising of the\r\nsiege. Better still, it afforded positive proof that these devils who\r\nhad inspired such fear were miserable creatures, who might be\r\nentrapped like mice and smoked out like wasps in their nest. Such\r\nunhoped-for good fortune was due to the Maid. She had done everything,\r\nfor without her nothing would have been done. She it was, who, in\r\nignorance wiser than the knowledge of captains and free-lances, had\r\nconverted an idle skirmish into a serious attack and had won the\r\nvictory by inspiring confidence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1024: At the capture of the Saint-Loup bastion:\r\n\r\n                          _Number of                  _Number of\r\n                           French engaged._            French slain._\r\n\r\nJournal du Siege           1,500\r\n                           without counting nobles.\r\nLetter of Charles VII                                  2\r\nMorosini's correspondent   3,500\r\nEberhard Windecke                                      2\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Number of          _Number of\r\n                                English engaged._   English slain._\r\n\r\nBrother Pasquerel               100 picked men      100 slain or taken\r\nJean d'Aulon                                        all killed or taken\r\nG.

She commanded that no one should think of quitting the\r\ntown, of attacking or making an assault, until he had first confessed.\r\nShe added that the men-at-arms must pay heed that no dissolute women\r\nfollowed in their train for fear lest God should cause them to be\r\ndefeated on account of their sins.[1026]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1026: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 107. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\npp. 289, 290.]\r\n\r\nWhen need was the Maid herself saw that her orders concerning bad\r\nwomen and blasphemers were scrupulously obeyed. More than once she\r\ndrove away the camp-followers. She rebuked men-at-arms who swore and\r\nblasphemed. One day, in the open street, a knight began to swear and\r\ntake God's name in vain. Jeanne heard him. She seized him by the\r\nthroat, exclaiming, \"Ah, Sir! dare you take in vain the name of Our\r\nLord and Master? In God's name you shall take back those words before\r\nI move from this place.\"\r\n\r\nA citizen's wife, passing down the street at that moment, beheld this\r\nman, who seemed to her to be a great baron, humbly receiving the\r\nSaint's reproaches and testifying his repentance.[1027]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1027: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 34, 35 (evidence of the widow\r\nHure).]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, which was Ascension Day, the captains held a\r\ncouncil-of-war in the house of Chancellor Cousinot in the Rue de la\r\nRose.[1028] There were present, as well as the Chancellor, my Lord the\r\nBastard, the Sire de Gaucourt, the Sire de Rais, the Sire de Graville,\r\nCaptain La Hire, my Lord Ambroise de Lore and several others. It was\r\ndecided that Les Tourelles, the chief stronghold of the besiegers,\r\nshould be attacked on the morrow. Meanwhile, it would be necessary to\r\nhold in check the English of the camp of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils.\r\nOn the previous day, when Talbot set out from Saint-Laurent, he had\r\nnot been able to reach Saint-Loup in time because he had been obliged\r\nto make a long circuit, going round the town from west to east. But,\r\nalthough, on that previous day, the enemy had lost command of the\r\nLoire above the town, they still held the lower river. They could\r\ncross it between Saint-Laurent and Saint-Prive[1029] as rapidly as the\r\nFrench could cross it by the Ile-aux-Toiles; and thus the English\r\nmight gather in force at Le Portereau. This, the French must prevent\r\nand, if possible, draw off the garrisons from Les Augustins and Les\r\nTourelles to Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils. With this object it was\r\ndecided that the people of Orleans with the folk from the communes,\r\nthat is, from the villages, should make a feigned attack on the\r\nSaint-Laurent camp, with mantelets, faggots, and ladders. Meanwhile,\r\nthe nobles would cross the Loire by l'Ile-aux-Toiles, would land at Le\r\nPortereau under the watch of Saint-Jean-le-Blanc which had been\r\nabandoned by the English, and attack the bastion of Les Augustins; and\r\nwhen that was taken, the fort of Les Tourelles.[1030] Thus there would\r\nbe one assault made by the citizens, another by the nobles; one real,\r\nthe other feigned; both useful, but only one glorious and worthy of\r\nknights. When the plan was thus drawn up, certain captains were of\r\nopinion that it would be well to send for the Maid and tell her what\r\nhad been decided.[1031] And, indeed, on the previous day, she had done\r\nso well that there was no longer need to hold her aloof. Others deemed\r\nthat it would be imprudent to tell her what was contemplated\r\nconcerning Les Tourelles. For it was important that the undertaking\r\nshould be kept secret, and it was feared that the holy damsel might\r\nspeak of it to her friends among the common people. Finally, it was\r\nagreed that she should know those decisions which affected the\r\ntrain-bands of Orleans, since, indeed, she was their captain, but that\r\nsuch matters as could not be safely communicated to the citizens\r\nshould be concealed from her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1028: May 5th.

These statements are very\r\ndoubtful.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was in another room of the house with the Chancellor's wife.\r\nMessire Ambroise de Lore went to fetch her; and, when she had come,\r\nthe Chancellor told her that the camp of Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils\r\nwas to be attacked on the morrow. She divined that something was being\r\nkept back; for she possessed a certain acuteness. Besides, since they\r\nhad hitherto concealed everything, it was natural she should suspect\r\nthat something was still being kept from her. This mistrust annoyed\r\nher. Did they think her incapable of keeping a secret? She said\r\nbitterly: \"Tell me what you have concluded and ordained. I could keep\r\na much greater secret than that.\"[1032]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1032: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 74, 75. Very\r\ndoubtful.]\r\n\r\nAnd refusing to sit down she walked to and fro in the room.\r\n\r\nMy Lord the Bastard deemed it well to avoid exasperating her by\r\ntelling her the truth. He pacified her without incriminating anybody:\r\n\"Jeanne, do not rage. It is impossible to tell you everything at once.\r\nWhat the Chancellor has said has been concluded and ordained. But if\r\nthose on the other side [of the water, the English of La Sologne]\r\nshould depart to come and succour the great bastion of Saint-Laurent\r\nand the English who are encamped near this part of the city, we have\r\ndetermined that some of us shall cross the river to do what we can\r\nagainst those on the other side [those of Les Augustins and Les\r\nTourelles]. And it seems to us that such a decision is good and\r\nprofitable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Maid replied that she was content, that such a decision seemed to\r\nher good, and that it should be carried out in the manner\r\ndetermined.[1033]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1033: _Ibid._, p. 75. _Journal du siege_, pp. 82, 83. Cf.\r\nthe evidence of S. Charles (_Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 116, 117).]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that by this proceeding the secrecy of the\r\ndeliberations had been violated, and that the nobles had not been able\r\nto do what they had determined or at least not in the way they had\r\ndetermined. On that Ascension Day the Maid for the last time sent a\r\nmessage of peace to the English, which she dictated to Brother\r\nPasquerel in the following terms: _Ye men of England, who have no\r\nright in the realm of France, the King of Heaven enjoins and commands\r\nyou by me, Jeanne the Maid, to leave your forts and return to your\r\ncountry. If ye will not I will make so great a noise as shall remain\r\nfor ever in the memory of man: This I write to you for the third and\r\nlast time, and I will write to you no more._\r\n\r\nSigned thus: Jhesus--Maria. Jeanne the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd below: _I should have sent to you with more ceremony. But you keep\r\nmy heralds. You kept my herald Guyenne. If you will send him back to\r\nme, I will send you some of your men taken at the bastion Saint-Loup;\r\nthey are not all dead._[1034]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1034: May 5th. _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 107 (Pasquerel's\r\nevidence).]\r\n\r\nJeanne went to La Belle Croix, took an arrow, and tied her letter to\r\nit with a string, then told an archer to shoot it to the English,\r\ncrying: \"Read! This is the message.\"\r\n\r\nThe English received the arrow, untied the letter, and having read it\r\nthey cried: \"This a message from the Armagnac strumpet.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she heard them, tears came into Jeanne's eyes and she wept. But\r\nsoon she beheld her saints, who spoke to her of Our Lord, and she was\r\ncomforted. \"I have had a message from my Lord,\" she said\r\njoyfully.[1035]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1035: _Ibid._, p. 108.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord the Bastard himself demanded the Maid's herald, threatening\r\nthat if he were not sent back he would keep the heralds whom the\r\nEnglish had sent to treat for the exchange of prisoners. It is\r\nasserted that he even threatened to put those prisoners to death. But\r\nAmbleville did not return.[1036]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1036: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 286. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 79, gives a different account of this episode.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF LES TOURELLES AND THE DELIVERANCE OF ORLEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Friday the 6th of May, the Maid rose at daybreak. She\r\nconfessed to her chaplain and heard mass sung before the priests and\r\nfighting men of her company.[1037] The zealous townsfolk were already\r\nup and armed. Whether or no she had told them, the citizens, who were\r\nstrongly determined to cross the Loire and attack Les Tourelles\r\nthemselves, were pressing in crowds to the Burgundian Gate. They found\r\nit shut. The Sire de Gaucourt was guarding it with men-at-arms. The\r\nnobles had taken this precaution in case the citizens should discover\r\ntheir enterprise and wish to take part in it. The gate was closed and\r\nwell defended. Bent on fighting and themselves recovering their\r\nprecious jewel, Les Tourelles, the citizens had recourse to her before\r\nwhom gates opened and walls fell; they sent for the Saint. She came,\r\nfrank and terrible. She went straight to the old Sire de Gaucourt,\r\nand, refusing to listen to him, said: \"You are a wicked man to try to\r\nprevent these people from going out. But whether you will or no, they\r\nwill go and will do as well as they did the other day.\"[1038]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1037: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 108 (Pasquerel's evidence).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1038: _Ibid._, pp. 116, 117. Evidence of S. Charles. P.\r\nMantellier, _Histoire du siege_, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nExcited by Jeanne's voice and encouraged by her presence, the\r\ncitizens, crying slaughter, threw themselves on Gaucourt and his\r\nmen-at-arms. When the old baron perceived that he could do nothing\r\nwith them, and that it was impossible to bring them to his way of\r\nthinking, he himself joined them. He had the gates opened wide and\r\ncried out to the townsfolk: \"Come, I will be your captain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the Lord of Villars and Sire d'Aulon he went out at the head\r\nof the soldiers, who had been keeping the gate, and all the\r\ntrain-bands of the town. At the foot of La Tour-Neuve, at the eastern\r\ncorner of the ramparts, there were boats at anchor. In them\r\nl'Ile-aux-Toiles was reached, and thence on a bridge formed by two\r\nboats they crossed over the narrow arm of the river which separates\r\nl'Ile-aux-Toiles from the Sologne bank.[1039] Those who arrived first\r\nentered the abandoned fort of Saint-Jean-le-Blanc, and, while waiting\r\nfor the others, amused themselves by demolishing it.[1040] Then, when\r\nall had passed over, the townsfolk gayly marched against Les\r\nAugustins. The bastion was situated in front of Les Tourelles, on the\r\nruins of the monastery; and the bastion would have to be taken before\r\nthe fortifications at the end of the bridge could be attacked. But the\r\nenemy came out of their entrenchments and advanced within two\r\nbow-shots of the French, upon whom from their bows and cross-bows they\r\nlet fly so thick a shower of arrows that the men of Orleans could not\r\nstand against them. They gave way and fled to the bridge of boats:\r\nthen, afraid of being cast into the river, they crossed over to\r\nl'Ile-aux-Toiles.[1041] The fighting men of the Sire de Gaucourt were\r\nmore accustomed to war. With the Lord of Villars, Sire d'Aulon, and a\r\nvaliant Spaniard, Don Alonzo de Partada, they took their stand on the\r\nslope of Saint-Jean-le-Blanc and resisted the enemy. Although very few\r\nin number, they were still holding out when, about three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, Captain La Hire and the Maid crossed the river with the\r\nfree-lances. Seeing the French hard put to it, and the English in\r\nbattle array, they mounted their horses, which they had brought over\r\nwith them, and holding their lances in rest spurred on against the\r\nenemy. The townsfolk, taking heart, followed them and drove back the\r\nEnglish. But at the foot of the bastion they were again\r\nrepulsed.[1042] In great agitation the Maid galloped from the bastion\r\nto the bank, and from the bank to the bastion, calling for the\r\nknights; but the knights did not come. Their plans had been upset,\r\ntheir order of battle reversed, and they needed time to collect\r\nthemselves. At last she saw floating over the island the banners of my\r\nLord the Bastard, the Marshal de Boussac, and the Lord de Rais. The\r\nartillery came too, and Master Jean de Montesclere with his culverin\r\nand his gunners, bringing all the engines needed for the assault. Four\r\nthousand men assembled round Les Augustins. But much time had been\r\nlost; they were only just beginning, and the sun was going down.[1043]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1039: _Journal du siege_, pp. 83, 84. Abbe Dubois, _Histoire\r\ndu siege_, p. 535. Jollois, _Histoire du siege_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1040: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1041: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 76. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, pp. 84, 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1042: \"_Et les rebouterent ils par maintes fois et\r\ntresbucherent de hault en bas._\" _Journal du siege_, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1043: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 214, 215 (Jean d'Aulon's\r\nevidence).]\r\n\r\nThe Sire de Gaucourt's men were ranged behind, to cover the besiegers\r\nin case the English from the bridge end should come to the aid of\r\ntheir countrymen in Les Augustins. But a quarrel arose in de\r\nGaucourt's company. Some, like Sire d'Aulon and Don Alonzo, judged it\r\nwell to stay at their post. Others were ashamed to stand idle. Hence\r\nhaughty words and bravado. Finally Don Alonzo and a man-at-arms,\r\nhaving challenged each other to see who would do the best, ran towards\r\nthe bastion hand in hand. At one single volley Maitre Jean's culverin\r\noverthrew the palisade. Straightway the two champions forced their way\r\nin.[1044]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1044: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 215 (Jean d'Aulon's evidence).]\r\n\r\n\"Enter boldly!\" cried the Maid.[1045] And she planted her standard on\r\nthe rampart. The Sire de Rais followed her closely.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1045: _Ibid._, p. 78 (evidence of Beaucroix). _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the French were increasing. They made a strong attack\r\non the bastion and soon took it by storm. Then one by one they had to\r\nassault the buildings of the monastery in which the _Godons_ were\r\nentrenched. In the end all the English were slain or taken, except a\r\nfew, who took refuge in Les Tourelles. In the huts the French found\r\nmany of their own men imprisoned. After bringing them out, they set\r\nfire to the fort, and thus made known to the English their new\r\ndisaster.[1046] It is said to have been the Maid who ordered the fire\r\nin order to put a stop to the pillage in which her men were\r\nmercilessly engaging.[1047]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1046: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 291. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 72. _Journal du siege_, pp. 84, 85. Of\r\ndoubtful authenticity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1047: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 291.]\r\n\r\nA great advantage had been won. But the French were slow to regain\r\nconfidence. When, in the darkness by the light of the fire, they\r\nbeheld for the first time close to them the bulwarks of Les Tourelles,\r\nthe men-at-arms were afraid. Certain said: \"It would take us more than\r\na month to capture it.\"[1048]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1048: Perceval de Cagny, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nThe lords, captains, and men-at-arms went back to the town to pass a\r\nquiet night. The archers and most of the townsfolk stayed at Le\r\nPortereau. The Maid would have liked to stay too, so as to be sure of\r\nbeginning again on the morrow.[1049] But, seeing that the captains\r\nwere leaving their horses and their pages in the fields, she followed\r\nthem to Orleans.[1050] Wounded in the foot by a caltrop,[1051]\r\novercome with fatigue, she felt weak, and contrary to her custom she\r\nbroke her fast, although the day was Friday.[1052] According to\r\nBrother Pasquerel, who in this matter is not very trustworthy, while\r\nshe was finishing her supper in her lodging, there came to her a noble\r\nwhose name is not mentioned and who addressed her thus: \"The captains\r\nhave met in council.[1053] They recognise how few we were in\r\ncomparison with the English, and that it was by God's great favour\r\nthat we won the victory. Now that the town is plentifully supplied we\r\nmay well wait for help from the King. Wherefore, the council deems it\r\ninexpedient for the men-at-arms to make a sally to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1049: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 79 (evidence of Beaucroix).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1050: _Ibid._, p. 70. _Chronique de la fete_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1051: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 291.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1052: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1053: The council is mentioned in _La chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 292; but this document is a mere echo of Brother\r\nPasquerel's evidence.]\r\n\r\nJeanne replied: \"You have been at your council; I have been at mine.\r\nNow believe me the counsel of Messire shall be followed and shall hold\r\ngood, whereas your counsel shall come to nought.\" And turning to\r\nBrother Pasquerel who was with her, she said: \"To-morrow rise even\r\nearlier than to-day, and do the best you can. Stay always at my side,\r\nfor to-morrow I shall have much ado--more than I have ever had, and\r\nto-morrow blood shall flow from my body.\"[1054]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1054: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 108, 109. Brother Pasquerel,\r\nwhom I follow here, reports Jeanne's saying in the following terms:\r\n_Exibit crastina die sanguis a corpore meo supra mammam._ I suspect\r\nhim of having added to the prophecy. He was too fond of miracles and\r\nprophecies. On the 28th of April the Maid says that the wind will\r\nchange, and it changed. Brother Pasquerel is not satisfied with so\r\nmoderate a marvel. He relates that Jeanne raised the waters of the\r\nLoire. We know on other authority that the Loire was high. It cannot\r\nbe denied that long before this Jeanne had foretold that she would be\r\nwounded. This fact, stated in a letter from Lyon, dated the 22nd of\r\nApril, 1429, was recorded in a register of La Cour des Comptes of\r\nBrabant. But she did not specify the day. _Dixit ... quod ipsa ante\r\nAureliam in conflictu telo vulnerabitur_ (_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 426).]\r\n\r\nIt was not true that the English outnumbered the French. On the\r\ncontrary they were far less numerous. There were scarce more than\r\nthree thousand men round Orleans. The succour from the King having\r\narrived, the captains could not have said that they were waiting for\r\nit. True it is that they were hesitating to proceed forthwith to\r\nattack Les Tourelles on the morrow; but that was because they feared\r\nlest the English under Talbot should enter the deserted town during\r\nthe assault, since the townsfolk, refusing to march against\r\nSaint-Laurent, had all gone to Le Portereau. The Maid's Council\r\ntroubled about none of these difficulties. No fears beset Saint\r\nCatherine and Saint Margaret. To doubt is to fear; they never doubted.\r\nWhatever may be said to the contrary, of military tactics and strategy\r\nthey knew nothing. They had not read the treatise of Vegetius, _De re\r\nmilitari_. Had they read it the town would have been lost. Jeanne's\r\nVegetius was Saint Catherine.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it was cried in the streets of the city that bread,\r\nwine, ammunition and all things necessary must be taken to those who\r\nhad stayed behind at Le Portereau. There was a constant passing to and\r\nfro of boats across the river. Men, women and children were carrying\r\nsupplies to the outposts.[1055]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1055: _Journal du siege_, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Saturday the 7th of May, Jeanne heard Brother Pasquerel\r\nsay mass and piously received the holy sacrament.[1056] Jacques\r\nBoucher's house was beset with magistrates and notable citizens. After\r\na night of fatigue and anxiety, they had just heard tidings which\r\nexasperated them. They had heard tell that the captains wanted to\r\ndefer the storming of Les Tourelles. With loud cries they appealed to\r\nthe Maid to help the townsfolk, sold, abandoned, and betrayed.[1057]\r\nThe truth was that my Lord the Bastard and the captains, having\r\nobserved during the night a great movement among the English on the\r\nupper Loire, were confirmed in their fears that Talbot would attack\r\nthe walls near the Renard Gate while the French were occupied on the\r\nleft bank. At sunrise they had perceived that during the night the\r\nEnglish had demolished their outwork Saint Prive, south of\r\nl'Ile-Charlemagne.[1058] That also caused them to believe firmly that\r\nin the evening the English had concentrated in the Saint-Laurent camp\r\nand the bastion, London. The townsfolk had long been irritated by the\r\ndelay of the King's men in raising the siege. And there is no doubt\r\nthat the captains were not so eager to bring it to an end as they\r\nwere.[1059] The captains lived by war, while the citizens died of\r\nit,--that made all the difference. The magistrates besought the Maid\r\nto complete without delay the deliverance she had already begun. They\r\nsaid to her: \"We have taken counsel and we entreat you to accomplish\r\nthe mission you have received from God and likewise from the King.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1056: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 109. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 295.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1057: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 292. _Trial_, vol. iii,\r\np. 215. _Journal du siege_, pp. 84, 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1058: _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1059: \"_Par l'accord et consentement des bourgeois d'Orleans\r\nmais contre l'opinion et volonte de tous les chefs et capitaines_,\"\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 292.]\r\n\r\n\"In God's name, I will,\" she said. And straightway she mounted her\r\nhorse, and uttering a very ancient phrase, she cried: \"Let who loves\r\nme follow me!\"[1060]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1060: _Chronique de l'etablissement de la fete_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 293. Le Roux de Lincy, _Proverbes_, vol. ii, p. 395.]\r\n\r\nAs she was leaving the treasurer's house a shad was brought her. She\r\nsaid to her host, smiling, \"In God's name! we will have it for supper.\r\nI will bring you back a _Godon_ who shall eat his share.\" She added:\r\n\"This evening we shall return by the bridge.\"[1061] For the last\r\nninety-nine days it had been impossible. But happily her words proved\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1061: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 124 (evidence of the woman P.\r\nMilet). _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nThe townsfolk had been too quick to take alarm. Notwithstanding their\r\nfear of Talbot and the English of the Saint-Laurent camp, the nobles\r\ncrossed the Loire in the early morning, and at Le Portereau rejoined\r\ntheir horses and pages who had passed the night there with the\r\narchers and train-bands. They were all there, the Bastard, the Sire de\r\nGaucourt, and the lords of Rais, Graville, Guitry, Coarraze, Villars,\r\nIlliers, Chailly, the Admiral de Culant, the captains La Hire, and\r\nPoton.[1062] The Maid was with them. The magistrates sent them great\r\nstore of engines of war: hurdles, all kinds of arrows, hammers, axes,\r\nlead, powder, culverins, cannon, and ladders.[1063] The attack began\r\nearly. What rendered it difficult was not the number of English\r\nentrenched in the bulwark and lodged in the towers: there were barely\r\nmore than five hundred of them;[1064] true, they were commanded by\r\nLord Moleyns, and under him by Lord Poynings and Captain Glasdale, who\r\nin France was called Glassidas, a man of humble birth, but the first\r\namong the English for courage.[1065] The assailants, citizens,\r\nmen-at-arms and archers were ten times more numerous. That so many\r\ncombatants had been assembled was greatly to the credit of the French\r\nnation; but so great an army of men could not be employed at once.\r\nKnights were not much use against earthworks; and the townsfolk\r\nalthough very zealous, were not very tenacious.[1066] Finally, the\r\nBastard, who was prudent and thoughtful, was afraid of Talbot.[1067]\r\nIndeed if Talbot had known and if he had wanted he might have taken\r\nthe town while the French were trying to take Les Tourelles. War is\r\nalways a series of accidents, but on that day no attempt whatever was\r\nmade to carry out any concerted movement. This vast army was not an\r\nirresistible force, since no one, not even the Bastard, knew how to\r\nbring it into action. In those days the issue of a battle was in the\r\nhands of a very few combatants. On the previous day everything had\r\nbeen decided by two or three men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1062: Berry, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 43, 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1063: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 292. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 284, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1064: _Journal du siege_, p. 87.

Notwithstanding the size of the army, for a long while\r\nthe assault resolved itself into a series of single combats. Twenty\r\ntimes did the most zealous approach the rampart and twenty times they\r\nwere forced to retreat.[1068] There were some wounded and some slain,\r\nbut not many. The nobles, who had been making war all their lives,\r\nwere cautious, while the soldiers of fortune were careful of their\r\nmen. The townsfolk were novices in war.[1069] The Maid alone threw\r\nherself into it with heart and soul. She was continually saying: \"Be\r\nof good cheer. Do not retreat. The fort will soon be yours.\"[1070]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1068: _Journal du siege_, p. 85. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 293. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 77.

Then about one o'clock they set\r\nto work again.[1071] The Maid carried the first ladder. As she was\r\nputting it up against the rampart, she was struck on the shoulder over\r\nthe right breast, by an arrow shot so straight that half a foot of the\r\nshaft pierced her flesh.[1072] She knew that she was to be wounded;\r\nshe had foretold it to her King, adding that he must employ her all\r\nthe same. She had announced it to the people of Orleans and spoken of\r\nit to her chaplain[1073] on the previous day; and certainly for the\r\nlast five days she had been doing her best to make the prophecy come\r\ntrue.[1074] When the English saw that the arrow had pierced her flesh\r\nthey were greatly encouraged: they believed that if blood were drawn\r\nfrom a witch all her power would vanish. It made the French very sad.\r\nThey carried her apart. Brother Pasquerel and Mugot, the page, were\r\nwith her. Being in pain, she was afraid and wept.[1075] As was usual\r\nwhen combatants were wounded in battle, a group of soldiers surrounded\r\nher; some wanted to charm her. It was a custom with men-at-arms to\r\nattempt to close wounds by muttering paternosters over them. Spells\r\nwere cast by means of incantations and conjurations. Certain\r\npaternosters had the power of stopping hemorrhage. Papers covered with\r\nmagic characters were also used. But it meant having recourse to the\r\npower of devils and committing mortal sin. Jeanne did not wish to be\r\ncharmed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1071: \"Post prandium,\" says Brother Pasquerel (_Trial_, vol.\r\niii, p. 108).

If my wound may be healed without sin\r\nthen am I willing to be made whole.\"[1076]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1076: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 109 (Pasquerel's evidence).]\r\n\r\nHer armour was taken off. The wound was anointed with olive oil and\r\nfat, and, when it was dressed, she confessed to Brother Pasquerel,\r\nweeping and groaning. Soon she beheld coming to her her heavenly\r\ncounsellors, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret. They wore crowns and\r\nemitted a sweet fragrance. She was comforted.[1077] She resumed her\r\narmour and returned to the attack.[1078]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1077: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 79; vol. iii, p. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1078: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 293.]\r\n\r\nThe sun was going down; and since morning the French had been wearing\r\nthemselves out in a vain attack upon the palisades of the bulwark. My\r\nLord the Bastard, seeing his men tired and night coming on, and afraid\r\ndoubtless of the English of the Saint-Laurent-des-Orgerils Camp,\r\nresolved to lead the army back to Orleans. He had the retreat sounded.\r\nThe trumpet was already summoning the combatants to Le Portereau.[1079]\r\nThe Maid came to him and asked him to wait a little.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1079: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 216 (Jean d'Aulon's evidence),\r\np. 25; (evidence of J. Luillier). _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 293.]\r\n\r\n\"In God's name!\" she said, \"you will enter very soon. Be not afraid\r\nand the English shall have no more power over you.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to some, she added: \"Wherefore, rest a little; drink and\r\neat.\"[1080]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1080: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 25. _Journal du siege_, pp. 85,\r\n86. Eberhard Windecke, p. 173.]\r\n\r\nWhile they were refreshing themselves, she asked for her horse and\r\nmounted it. Then, leaving her standard with a man of her company, she\r\nwent alone up the hill into the vineyards, which it had been\r\nimpossible to till this April, but where the tiny spring leaves were\r\nbeginning to open. There, in the calm of evening, among the vine props\r\ntied together in sheaves and the lines of low vines drinking in the\r\nearly warmth of the earth, she began to pray and listened for her\r\nheavenly voices.[1081] Too often tumult and noise prevented her from\r\nhearing what her angel and her saints had to say to her. She could\r\nonly understand them well in solitude or when the bells were tinkling\r\nin the distance, and evening sounds soft and rhythmic were ascending\r\nfrom field and meadow.[1082]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1081: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 8 (evidence of Dunois). I\r\nemphatically reject the facts alleged by Charles du Lys, concerning\r\nGuy de Cailly, who is said to have accompanied Jeanne into the\r\nvineyard and seen the angels coming down to her. Guy de Cailly's\r\npatent of nobility is apocryphal.

He was the least of the\r\nnobles in the army; but in the battles of those days every man was a\r\nlaw unto himself. The Maid's standard was still waving in front of the\r\nbulwark. The man who bore it was dropping with fatigue and had passed\r\nit on to a soldier, surnamed the Basque, of the company of my Lord of\r\nVillars.[1083] It occurred to Sire d'Aulon, as he looked upon this\r\nstandard blessed by priests and held to bring good luck, that if it\r\nwere borne in front, the fighting men, who loved it dearly, would\r\nfollow it and in order not to lose it would scale the bulwark. With\r\nthis idea he went to the Basque and said: \"If I were to enter there\r\nand go on foot up to the bulwark would you follow me?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1083: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 216. The Count Couret, _Un\r\nfragment inedit des anciens registres de la Prevote d'Orleans_,\r\nOrleans, 1897, pp. 12, 20, 21, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThe Basque promised that he would. Straightway Sire d'Aulon went down\r\ninto the ditch and protecting himself with his shield, which sheltered\r\nhim from the stones fired from the cannon, advanced towards the\r\nrampart.[1084]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1084: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 216.]\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour, the Maid, having offered a short prayer,\r\nreturned to the men-at-arms and said to them: \"The English are\r\nexhausted. Bring up the ladders.\"[1085]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1085: _Journal du siege_, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nIt was true. They had so little powder that their last volley fired in\r\nan insufficient charge carried no further than a stone thrown by\r\nhand.[1086] Nothing but fragments of weapons remained to them. She\r\nwent towards the fort. But when she reached the ditch she suddenly\r\nbeheld the standard so dear to her, a thousand times dearer than her\r\nsword, in the hands of a stranger. Thinking it was in danger, she\r\nhastened to rescue it and came up with the Basque just as he was going\r\ndown into the ditch. There she seized her standard by the part known\r\nas its tail, that is the end of the flag, and pulled at it with all\r\nher might, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Ha! my standard, my standard!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1086: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 293.]\r\n\r\nThe Basque stood firm, not knowing who was pulling thus from above.\r\nAnd the Maid would not let it go. The nobles and captains saw the\r\nstandard shake, took it for a sign and rallied. Meanwhile Sire d'Aulon\r\nhad reached the rampart. He imagined that the Basque was following\r\nclose behind. But, when he turned round he perceived that he had\r\nstopped on the other side of the ditch, and he cried out to him: \"Eh!\r\nBasque, what did you promise me?\"\r\n\r\nAt this cry the Basque pulled so hard that the Maid let go, and he\r\nbore the standard to the rampart.[1087]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1087: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 216, 217.]\r\n\r\nJeanne understood and was satisfied. To those near her she said: \"Look\r\nand see when the flag of my standard touches the bulwark.\"\r\n\r\nA knight replied: \"Jeanne, the flag touches.\"\r\n\r\nThen she cried: \"All is yours. Enter.\"[1088]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1088: _Journal du siege_, p. 86. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 293.]\r\n\r\nStraightway nobles and citizens, men-at-arms, archers, townsfolk threw\r\nthemselves wildly into the ditch and climbed up the palisades so\r\nquickly and in such numbers that they looked like a flock of birds\r\ndescending on a hedge.[1089] And the French, who had now entered\r\nwithin the fortifications, saw retreating before them, but with their\r\nfaces turned proudly towards the enemy, the Lords Moleyns and\r\nPoynings, Sir Thomas Giffart, Baillie of Mantes, and Captain Glasdale,\r\nwho were covering the flight of their men to Les Tourelles.[1090] In\r\nhis hand Glasdale was holding the standard of Chandos, which, after\r\nhaving waved over eighty years of victories, was now retreating before\r\nthe standard of a child.[1091] For the Maid was there, standing upon\r\nthe rampart. And the English, panic-stricken, wondered what kind of a\r\nwitch this could be whose powers did not depart with the flowing of\r\nher blood, and who with charms healed her deep wounds. Meanwhile she\r\nwas looking at them kindly and sadly and crying out, her voice broken\r\nwith sobs:\r\n\r\n\"Glassidas! Glassidas! surrender, surrender to the King of Heaven.\r\nThou hast called me strumpet; but I have great pity on thy soul and on\r\nthe souls of thy men.\"[1092]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1089: _Chronique de la fete_, in the _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n294.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1090: _Journal du siege_, p. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1091: Letter from Charles VII to the inhabitants of\r\nNarbonne, 10 May, 1429, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 103. Monstrelet, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 365.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1092: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 110 (Pasquerel's evidence).]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, from the walls of the town and the bulwark of La\r\nBelle Croix cannon balls rained down upon Les Tourelles.[1093]\r\nMontargis and Rifflart cast forth stones. Maitre Guillaume Duisy's new\r\ncannon, from the Chesneau postern, hurled forth balls weighing one\r\nhundred and twenty pounds.[1094] Les Tourelles were attacked from the\r\nbridge side. Across the arch broken by the English a narrow footway\r\nwas thrown, and Messire Nicole de Giresme, a knight in holy orders,\r\nwas the first to pass over.[1095] Those who followed him set fire to\r\nthe palisade which blocked the approach to the fort on that side. Thus\r\nthe six hundred English, their strength and their weapons alike\r\nexhausted, found themselves assailed both in front and in the rear. In\r\na crafty and terrible manner they were also attacked from beneath. The\r\npeople of Orleans had loaded a great barge with pitch, tow, faggots,\r\nhorse-bones, old shoes, resin, sulphur, ninety-eight pounds of olive\r\noil and such other materials as might easily take fire and smoke. They\r\nhad steered it under the wooden bridge, thrown by the enemy from Les\r\nTourelles to the bulwark: they had anchored the barge there and set\r\nfire to its cargo. The fire from the barge had caught the bridge just\r\nwhen the English were retreating. Through smoke and flames the six\r\nhundred passed over the burning platform. At length it came to the\r\nturn of William Glasdale, Lord Poynings and Lord Moleyns, who with\r\nthirty or forty captains, were the last to leave the lost bulwark; but\r\nwhen they set foot on the bridge, its beams, reduced to charcoal,\r\ncrumbled beneath them, and they all with the Chandos standard were\r\nengulfed in the Loire.[1096]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1093: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 293, 294.

Four\r\nhundred were slain, the others taken. The day had cost the people of\r\nOrleans a hundred men.[1099]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1099: The number of the English who defended Les Tourelles\r\nis given in _Le journal du siege_ as 400 or 500; in Charles VII's\r\nletter as 600; in _La relation de la fete du 8 mai_ as 800; in _La\r\nchronique de la Pucelle_ as 500. It is impossible to fix exactly the\r\nnumber of the French, but they were more than ten times as many as the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe English losses, by Guillaume Girault, are said to have been 300\r\nslain and taken; by Berry, 400 or 500 slain and taken; by Jean\r\nChartier, about 400 slain, the rest taken; by _La chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, 300 slain, 200 taken; by _Le journal du siege_, 400 or 500\r\nslain besides a few taken. By Monstrelet, in the MSS., 600 or 800\r\nslain or taken; in the printed editions, 1000; by Bower, 600 and more\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the French are said by Perceval de Cagny to have been 16\r\nto 20 slain; by Eberhard Windecke, 5 slain and a few wounded; by\r\nMonstrelet, about 100. The Maid estimated that in the various\r\nengagements at Orleans in which she took part \"one hundred and even\r\nmore\" of the French were wounded.]\r\n\r\nWhen in the black darkness, along the fire-reddened banks of the\r\nLoire, the last cries of the vanquished had died away, the French\r\ncaptains, amazed at their victory, looked anxiously towards\r\nSaint-Laurent-des Orgerils, for they were still afraid lest Sir John\r\nTalbot should sally forth from his camp to avenge those whom he had\r\nfailed to succour. Throughout that long attack, which had lasted from\r\nsunrise to sunset, Talbot, the Earl of Suffolk and the English of\r\nSaint-Laurent had not left their entrenchments. Even when Les\r\nTourelles were taken the conquerors remained on the watch, still\r\nexpecting Talbot.[1100] But this Talbot, with whose name French\r\nmothers frightened their children, did not budge. He had been greatly\r\nfeared that day, and he himself had feared lest,[1101] if he withdrew\r\nany of his troops to succour Les Tourelles, the French would capture\r\nhis camp and his forts on the west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1100: _Journal du siege_, p. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: Perceval de Cagny, p. 147. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 295.]\r\n\r\nThe army prepared to return to the town. In three hours, the bridge,\r\nthree arches of which had been broken, was rendered passable. Some\r\nhours after darkness, the Maid entered the city by the bridge as she\r\nhad foretold.[1102] In like manner all her prophecies were fulfilled\r\nwhen their fulfilment depended on her own courage and determination.\r\nThe captains accompanied her, followed by all the men-at-arms, the\r\narchers, the citizens and the prisoners who were brought in two by\r\ntwo. The bells of the city were ringing; the clergy and people sang\r\nthe Te Deum.[1103] After God and his Blessed Mother, they gave thanks\r\nin all humility to Saint Aignan and Saint Euverte, who had been\r\nbishops in their mortal lives and were now the heavenly patrons of the\r\ncity. The townsfolk believed that both before and during the siege\r\nthey had given the saints so much wax and had paraded their relics in\r\nso many processions that they had deserved their powerful\r\nintercession, and that thereby they had won the victory and been\r\ndelivered out of the enemy's hand. There was no doubt about the\r\nintervention of the saints because at the time of assault on Les\r\nTourelles two bishops bright and shining had been seen in the sky,\r\nhovering over the fort.[1104]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1102: _Journal du siege_, p. 88. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 295. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1103: _Chronique de l'etablissement de la fete_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 294 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1104: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 163.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was brought back to Jacques Boucher's house, where a surgeon\r\nagain dressed the wound she had received above the breast. She took\r\nfour or five slices of bread soaked in wine and water, but neither ate\r\nnor drank anything else.[1105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1105: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 295.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Sunday, the 8th of May, being the Feast of the\r\nAppearance of St. Michael, it was announced in Orleans, in the\r\nmorning, that the English issuing forth from those western bastions\r\nwhich were all that remained to them, were ranging themselves before\r\nthe town moat in battle array and with standards flying. The folk of\r\nOrleans, both the men-at-arms and the train-bands, greatly desired to\r\nfall upon them. At daybreak Marshal de Boussac and a number of\r\ncaptains went out and took up their positions over against the\r\nenemy.[1106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1106: _Journal du siege_, p. 89. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 296.

The passage beginning with the words, \"The\r\nSire of Rocquencourt said,\" must be taken as historical.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid went out into the country with the priests. Being unable to\r\nput on her cuirass because of the wound on her shoulder, she merely\r\nwore one of those light coats-of-mail called _jaserans_.[1107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1107: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 9 (evidence of Dunois).]\r\n\r\nThe men-at-arms inquired of her: \"To-day being the Sabbath, is it\r\nwrong to fight?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"You must hear mass.\"[1108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1108: _Ibid._, p. 29 (evidence of J. de Champeaux).]\r\n\r\nShe did not think the enemy should be attacked.\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of the holy Sabbath do not give battle. Do not attack\r\nthe English, but if the English attack you, defend yourselves stoutly\r\nand bravely, and be not afraid, for you will overcome them.\"[1109]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1109: _Journal du siege_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nIn the country, at the foot of a cross, where four roads met, one of\r\nthose consecrated stones, square and flat, which priests carried with\r\nthem on their journeys, was placed upon a table. Very solemnly did the\r\nofficiating ecclesiastics sing hymns, responses and prayers; and at\r\nthis altar the Maid with all the priests and all the men-at-arms heard\r\nmass.[1110]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1110: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\nAfter the _Deo gratias_ she recommended them to observe the movements\r\nof the English. \"Now look whether their faces or their backs be\r\ntowards you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was told that they had turned their backs and were going away.\r\n\r\nThree times she had told them: \"Depart from Orleans and your lives\r\nshall be saved.\" Now she asked that they should be allowed to go\r\nwithout more being required of them.\r\n\r\n\"It is not well pleasing to my Lord that they should be engaged\r\nto-day,\" she said. \"You will have them another time. Come, let us give\r\nthanks to God.\"[1111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1111: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\nThe _Godons_ were going. During the night they had held a council of\r\nwar and resolved to depart.[1112] In order to put a bold front on\r\ntheir retreat and to prevent its being cut off, they had faced the\r\nfolk of Orleans for an hour, now they marched off in good order.[1113]\r\nCaptain La Hire and Sire de Lore, curious as to which way they would\r\ntake and desiring to see whether they would leave anything behind\r\nthem, rode three or four miles in pursuit with a hundred or a hundred\r\nand twenty horse. The English were retreating towards Meung.[1114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1112: _Chronique de l'etablissement de la fete_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 294, 295. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1113: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1114: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 71, 97, 110. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 89. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 297.

Eberhard Windecke, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nA crowd of citizens, villeins and villagers rushed into the abandoned\r\nforts. The _Godons_ had left their sick and their prisoners there. The\r\ntownsfolk discovered also ammunition and even victuals, which were\r\ndoubtless not very abundant and not very excellent. \"But,\" says a\r\nBurgundian, \"they made good cheer out of them, for they cost them\r\nlittle.\"[1115] Weapons, cannons and mortars were carried into the\r\ntown. The forts were demolished so that they might henceforth be\r\nuseless to the enemy.[1116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1115: Charles VII's letter to the people of Narbonne, in the\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, p. 101. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1116: _Journal du siege_, pp. 209 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn that day there were grand and solemn processions and a good\r\nfriar[1117] preached. Clerks, nobles, captains, magistrates,\r\nmen-at-arms and citizens devoutly went to church and the people cried:\r\n\"Noel!\"[1118]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1117: _Ibid._, p. 216. _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 295.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1118: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 110. _Journal du siege_, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nThus, on the 8th of May, in the morning, was the town of Orleans\r\ndelivered, two hundred and nine days after the siege had been laid and\r\nnine days after the coming of the Maid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT TOURS AND AT SELLES-EN-BERRY--THE TREATISES OF JACQUES\r\nGELU AND OF JEAN GERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sunday the 8th of May, the English departed,\r\nretreating towards Meung and Beaugency. In the afternoon of the same\r\nday, Messire Florent d'Illiers with his men-at-arms left the town and\r\nwent straight to his captaincy of Chateaudun to defend it against the\r\n_Godons_ who had a garrison at Marchenoir and were about to descend on\r\nLe Dunois. On the next day the other captains from La Beauce and\r\nGatinais returned to their towns and strongholds.[1119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1119: _Journal du siege_, p. 91. G.

They wept with joy and with gratitude and\r\noffered themselves to her for her to do with them and their goods\r\nwhatever she would. And she thanked them kindly.[1121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1120: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1121: _Journal du siege_, pp. 91, 92.

In this letter he announced the capture of the forts of\r\nSaint-Loup, Les Augustins and Les Tourelles and called upon the\r\ntownsfolk to praise God and do honour to the great feats accomplished\r\nthere, especially by the Maid, who \"had always been present when these\r\ndeeds were done.\"[1122] Thus did the royal power describe Jeanne's\r\nshare in the victory. It was in no wise a captain's share; she held no\r\ncommand of any kind. But, sent by God, at least so it might be\r\nbelieved, her presence was a help and a consolation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1122: _Charles VII's Letter to the Inhabitants of Narbonne_,\r\nin _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 101, 104.

Banner in hand, she\r\nrode out to meet him and when she came to him, she took off her cap\r\nand bowed her head as far as she could over her horse. The King lifted\r\nhis hood, bade her look up and kissed her. It is said that he felt\r\nglad to see her, but in reality we know not what he felt.[1125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1123: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 80. _Journal du siege_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1124: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 72, 76, 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1125: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 116 (evidence of S.

Messire Jacques Gelu, sometime\r\nCouncillor to the Dauphin and now my Lord Archbishop of Embrun,[1126]\r\nhad at first been afraid that the King's enemies had sent him this\r\nshepherdess to poison him, or that she was a witch possessed by\r\ndemons. In the beginning he had advised her being carefully\r\ninterrogated, not hastily repulsed, for appearances are deceptive and\r\ndivine grace moves in a mysterious manner. Now, after having read the\r\nconclusions of the doctors of Poitiers, learnt the deliverance of\r\nOrleans, and heard the cry of the common folk, Messire Jacques Gelu no\r\nlonger doubted the damsel's innocence and goodness. Seeing that the\r\ndoctors were divided in their opinion of her, he drew up a brief\r\ntreatise, which he sent to the King, with a very ample, a very humble,\r\nand a very worthy dedicatory epistle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1126: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 394, 407; vol. v, p. 413.

The Archbishop\r\nof Embrun's treatise is likewise a carefully planned scholastic\r\nlabyrinth. Herein one advances only to retreat and retreats only to\r\nadvance, but without entirely losing one's way provided one walks with\r\nsufficient patience and attention. Like all scholastics, Gelu begins\r\nby giving the reasons against his own opinion and it is not until he\r\nhas followed his opponent at some length that he returns to his own\r\nargument. Into all the intricacies of his labyrinth it would take too\r\nlong to follow him. But since those who were round the King consulted\r\nthis theological treatise, since it was addressed to the King and\r\nsince the King and his Council may have based on it their opinion of\r\nJeanne and their conduct towards her, one is curious to know what, on\r\nso singular an occasion, they found taught and recommended therein.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1127: L. Paris, _Notice sur le dedale ou labyrinthe de\r\nl'eglise de Reims_, in _Ann. des Inst. provinc._, 1857, vol. ix, p.\r\n233.]\r\n\r\nTreating first of the Church's weal, Jacques Gelu holds that God\r\nraised up the Maid to confound the heretics, the number of whom,\r\naccording to him, is by no means small. \"To turn to confusion those\r\nwho believe in God as if they believed not,\" he writes, \"the Almighty,\r\nwho hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, _King of\r\nKings and Lord of Lords_, was pleased to succour the King of France by\r\nthe hand of a child of low estate.\" The Archbishop of Embrun discerns\r\nfive reasons why the divine succour was granted to the King; to wit:\r\nthe justice of his cause, the striking merits of his predecessors, the\r\nprayers of devout souls and the sighs of the oppressed, the injustice\r\nof the enemies of the kingdom and the insatiable cruelty of the\r\nEnglish nation.\r\n\r\nThat God should have chosen a maid to destroy armies in no way\r\nsurprises him. \"He created insects, such as flies and fleas, with\r\nwhich to humble man's pride.\" So persistently do these tiny creatures\r\nworry and weary us that they prevent our studying or acting. However\r\nstrong his self-control, a man may not rest in a room infested with\r\nfleas. By the hand of a young peasant, born of poor and lowly parents,\r\nsubject to menial labour, ignorant and simple beyond saying, it hath\r\npleased Him to strike down the proud, to humble them and make His\r\nMajesty manifest unto them by the deliverance of the perishing.\r\n\r\nThat to a virgin the Most High should have revealed His designs\r\nconcerning the Kingdom of the Lilies cannot astonish us; on virgins He\r\nreadily bestows the gift of prophecy. To the sibyls it pleased Him to\r\nreveal mysteries hidden from all the Gentiles. On the authority of\r\nNicanor, of Euripides, of Chrysippus, of Nennius, of Apollodorus, of\r\nEratosthenes, of Heraclides Ponticus, of Marcus Varro and of\r\nLactantius, Messire Jacques Gelu teaches that the sibyls were ten in\r\nnumber: the Persian, the Libyan, the Delphian, the Cimmerian, the\r\nErythrean, the Samian, the Cumaean, the Hellespontine, the Phrygian and\r\nthe Tiburtine. They prophesied to the Gentiles the glorious\r\nincarnation of Our Lord, the resurrection of the dead and the\r\nconsummation of the ages. This example appears to him worthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAs for Jeanne, she is in herself unknowable. Aristotle teaches: there\r\nis nothing in the intellect which hath not first been in the senses,\r\nand the senses cannot penetrate beyond experience. But what the mind\r\ncannot grasp directly it may come to comprehend by a roundabout way.\r\nWhen we consider her works, as far as in our human weakness we can\r\nknow, we say the Maid is of God. Albeit she hath adopted the\r\nprofession of arms, she never counsels cruelty; she is merciful to her\r\nenemies when they throw themselves upon her mercy and she offers\r\npeace. Finally the Archbishop of Embrun believes that this Maid is an\r\nangel sent by God, the Lord of Hosts, for the saving of the people;\r\nnot that she has the nature, but that she does the work of an angel.\r\n\r\nConcerning the conduct to be followed in circumstances so marvellous,\r\nthe doctor is of opinion that in war the King should act according to\r\nhuman wisdom. It is written: \"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\"\r\nIn vain would an active mind have been bestowed on man were he not to\r\nmake use of it in his undertakings. Long deliberation must precede\r\nprompt execution. It is not by a woman's desires or supplications that\r\nGod's help is obtained. A prosperous issue is the fruit of action and\r\nof counsel.\r\n\r\nBut the inspiration of God must not be rejected. Wherefore the will of\r\nthe Maid must be accomplished, even should that will appear doubtful\r\nand mistaken. If the words of the Maid are found to be stable, then\r\nthe King must follow her and confide to her as to God the conduct of\r\nthe enterprise to which she is committed. Should any doubt occur to\r\nthe King, let him incline rather towards divine than towards human\r\nwisdom, for as there is no comparing the finite with the infinite so\r\nthere is no comparing the wisdom of man with the wisdom of God.\r\nWherefore we must believe that He who sent us this child is able to\r\nimpart unto her a counsel superior to man's counsel. Then from this\r\nAristotelian reasoning the Archbishop of Embrun draws the following\r\ntwo-headed conclusion: \"On the one hand we give it to be understood\r\nthat the wisdom of this world must be consulted in the ordering of\r\nbattle, the use of engines, ladders and all other implements of war,\r\nthe building of bridges, the sufficient despatch of supplies, the\r\nraising of funds, and in all matters without which no enterprise can\r\nsucceed save by miracle.\r\n\r\n\"But when on the other hand divine wisdom is seen to be acting in some\r\npeculiar way, then human reason must be humble and withdraw. Then it\r\nis, we observe, that the counsel of the Maid must be asked for, sought\r\nafter and adopted before all else. He who gives life gives wherewithal\r\nto support life. On his workers he bestows the instruments for their\r\nwork. Wherefore let us hope in the Lord. He makes the King's cause his\r\nown. Those who support it he will inspire with the wisdom necessary to\r\nmake it triumphant. God leaves no work imperfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop concludes his treatise by commending the Maid to the\r\nKing because she inspires holy thoughts and makes manifest the works\r\nof piety. \"This counsel do we give the King that every day he do such\r\nthings as are well pleasing in the sight of the Lord and that he\r\nconfer with the Maid concerning them. When he shall have received her\r\nadvice let him practise it piously and devoutly; then shall not the\r\nLord withdraw His hand from Him but continue His loving kindness unto\r\nhim.\"[1128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1128: Bibl. Nat. Latin Collection, no. 6199, folio 36.\r\n_Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 395-410. Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et\r\nconsultations_, pp. 365 _et seq._ Le P. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant\r\nl'Eglise de son temps_, pp. 31-52.]\r\n\r\nThe great doctor Gerson, former Chancellor of the University, was then\r\nending his days at Lyon in the monastery of Les Celestins, of which\r\nhis brother was prior. His life had been full of work and\r\nweariness.[1129] In 1408 he was priest of Saint-Jean-en-Greve in\r\nParis. In that year he delivered in his parish church the funeral\r\noration of the Duke of Orleans, assassinated by order of the Duke of\r\nBurgundy; and he roused the passions of the mob to such a fury that he\r\nran great danger of losing his life. At the Council of Constance,\r\npossessed by a so-called \"merciful cruelty\"[1130] which goaded him to\r\nsend a heretic to the stake, he urged the condemnation of John Huss,\r\nregardless of the safe-conduct which the latter had received from the\r\nEmperor; for in common with all the fathers there assembled he held\r\nthat according to natural law both divine and human, no promise should\r\nbe kept if it were prejudicial to the Catholic Faith. With a like\r\nardour he prosecuted in the Council the condemnation of the thesis of\r\nJean Petit concerning the lawfulness of tyrannicide. In things\r\ntemporal as well as spiritual he advocated uniform obedience and the\r\nrespect of established authority. In one of his sermons he likens the\r\nkingdom of France to the statue of Nebuchadnezzar, making the\r\nmerchants and artisans the legs of the statue, \"which are partly iron,\r\npartly clay, because of their labour and humility in serving and\r\nobeying....\" Iron signifies labour, and clay humility. All the evil\r\nhas arisen from the King and the great citizens being held in\r\nsubjection by those of low estate.[1131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1129: Launoy, _Historia Navarrici Gymasii_, book iv, ch. v.\r\nJ.B.

A.\r\nLafontaine, _De Johanne Gersonio puerorum adulescentiumque\r\ninstitutore...._ La Chapelle-Montligeon, 1902, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe deliverance of the city of Orleans must have gladdened the heart\r\nof the old Orleanist partisan. The Dauphin's Councillors, eager to set\r\nthe Maid to work, had told him of the deliberations at Poitiers, and\r\nasked him, as a good servant of the house of France, for his opinion\r\nconcerning them. In reply he wrote a compendious treatise on the Maid.\r\n\r\nIn this work he is careful from the first to distinguish between\r\nmatters of faith and matters of devotion. In questions of faith doubt\r\nis forbidden. With regard to questions of devotion the unbeliever, to\r\nuse a colloquial expression, is not necessarily damned. Three\r\nconditions are necessary if a question is to be considered as one of\r\ndevotion: first, it must be edifying; second, it must be probable and\r\nattested by popular report or the testimony of the faithful; third, it\r\nmust touch on nothing contrary to faith. When these conditions are\r\nfulfilled, it is fitting neither persistently to condemn nor to\r\napprove, but rather to appeal to the church.\r\n\r\nFor example, the conception of the very holy Virgin, indulgences,\r\nrelics, are matters of faith and not of devotion. A relic may be\r\nworshipped in one place or another, or in several places at once.\r\nRecently the Parlement of Paris disputed concerning the head of Saint\r\nDenys, worshipped at Saint-Denys in France and likewise in the\r\ncathedral at Paris. This is a matter of devotion.[1133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1133: Gallia Christiana, vol. vii, col. 142. Jean Juvenal\r\ndes Ursins, year 1406.]\r\n\r\nWhence it may be concluded that it is lawful to consider the question\r\nof the Maid as a matter of devotion, especially when one reflects on\r\nher motives, which are the restitution of his kingdom to her King and\r\nthe very righteous expulsion or destruction of her very stubborn\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nAnd if there be those who make various statements concerning her idle\r\ntalk, her frivolity, her guile, now is the time to quote the saying of\r\nCato: \"Common report is not our judge.\" According to the words of the\r\nApostle, it doth not become us to call in question the servant of God.\r\nMuch better is it to abstain from judgment, as is permitted, or to\r\nsubmit doubtful points to ecclesiastical superiors. This is the\r\nprinciple followed in the canonisation of saints. The catalogue of the\r\nsaints is not, strictly speaking, necessarily a matter of faith, but\r\nof pious devotion. Nevertheless, it is not to be highly censured by\r\nany manner of man.\r\n\r\nTo come to the present case, the following circumstances are to be\r\nnoted: First, the royal council and the men-at-arms were induced to\r\nbelieve and to obey; and they faced the risk of being put to shame by\r\ndefeat under the leadership of a girl. Second, the people rejoice, and\r\ntheir pious faith seems to tend to the glory of God and the\r\nconfounding of his enemies. Third, the enemy, even his princes, are in\r\nhiding and stricken with many terrors. They give way to weakness like\r\na woman with child; they are overthrown like the Egyptians in the song\r\nsung by Miriam, sister of Moses, to the sound of the timbrel in the\r\nmidst of the women who went out with her with timbrels and with\r\ndances: \"Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the\r\nhorse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\"[1134] And let us\r\nlikewise sing the song of Miriam with the devotion which becometh our\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1134: Exodus, xv, 20, 21 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nFourth, and in conclusion, this point is worthy of consideration: The\r\nMaid and her men-at-arms despise not the wisdom of men; they tempt\r\nnot God. Wherefore it is plain that the Maid goes no further than what\r\nshe interprets to be the instruction or inspiration received from God.\r\n\r\nMany of the incidents of her life from childhood up have been\r\ncollected in abundance and might be set forth; but these we shall not\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nHere may be cited the examples of Deborah and of Saint Catherine who\r\nmiraculously converted fifty doctors or rhetoricians, of Judith and of\r\nJudas Maccabeus. As is usually the case, there were many circumstances\r\nin their lives which were purely natural.\r\n\r\nA first miracle is not always followed by the other miracles which men\r\nexpect. Even if the Maid should be disappointed in her expectation and\r\nin ours (which God forbid) we ought not to conclude therefrom, that\r\nthe first manifestation of her miraculous power proceeded from an evil\r\nspirit and not from heavenly grace; we should believe rather that our\r\nhopes have been disappointed because of our ingratitude and our\r\nblasphemy, or by some just and impenetrable judgment of God. We\r\nbeseech him to turn away his anger from us and vouchsafe unto us his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nHerein we perceive lessons, first for the King and the Blood Royal,\r\nsecondly for the King's forces and the kingdom; thirdly for the clergy\r\nand people; fourthly for the Maid. Of all these lessons the object is\r\nthe same, to wit: a good life, consecrated to God, just towards\r\nothers, sober, virtuous and temperate. With regard to the Maid's\r\npeculiar lesson, it is that God's grace revealed in her be employed\r\nnot in caring for trifles, not in worldly advantage, nor in party\r\nhatred, nor in violent sedition, nor in avenging deeds done, nor in\r\nfoolish self-glorification, but in meekness, prayer, and thanksgiving.\r\nAnd let every one contribute a liberal supply of temporal goods so\r\nthat peace be established and justice once more administered, and that\r\ndelivered out of the hands of our enemies, God being favourable unto\r\nus, we may serve him in holiness and righteousness.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his treatise, Gerson briefly examines one point\r\nof canon law which had been neglected by the doctors of Poitiers. He\r\nestablishes that the Maid is not forbidden to dress as a man.\r\n\r\nFirstly. The ancient law forbade a woman to dress as a man, and a man\r\nas a woman. This restriction, as far as strict legality is concerned,\r\nceases to be enforced by the new law.\r\n\r\nSecondly. In its moral bearing this law remains binding. But in such a\r\ncase it is merely a matter of decency.\r\n\r\nThirdly. From a legal and moral standpoint this law does not refuse\r\nmasculine and military attire to the Maid, whom the King of Heaven\r\nappoints His standard-bearer, in order that she may trample underfoot\r\nthe enemies of justice. In the operations of divine power the end\r\njustifies the means.\r\n\r\nFourthly. Examples may be quoted from history alike sacred and\r\nprofane, notably Camilla and the Amazons.\r\n\r\nJean Gerson completed this treatise on Whit-Sunday, a week after the\r\ndeliverance of Orleans. It was his last work. He died in the July of\r\nthat year, 1429, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.[1135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1135: _Oeuvres de Gerson_, ed. Ellies Dupin, Paris, 1706,\r\nin folio, vol. iv, p. 864. _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 298; vol. v, p. 412.\r\nLe P. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant l'Eglise de son temps_, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nThe treatise is the political testament of the great university doctor\r\nin exile. The Maid's victory gladdened the last days of his life. With\r\nhis dying voice he sings the Song of Miriam. But with his rejoicings\r\nover this happy event are mingled the sad presentiments of\r\nkeen-sighted old age. While in the Maid he beholds a subject for the\r\nrejoicing and edification of the people, he is afraid that the hopes\r\nshe inspires may soon be disappointed. And he warns those who now\r\nexalt her in the hour of triumph not to forsake her in the day of\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nHis dry close reasoning does not fundamentally differ from the ampler,\r\nmore flowery argument of Jacques Gelu. One and the other contain the\r\nsame reasons, the same proofs; and in their conclusions both doctors\r\nagree with the judges of Poitiers.\r\n\r\nFor the Poitiers doctors, for the Archbishop of Embrun, for the\r\nex-chancellor of the University, for all the theologians of the\r\nArmagnac party the Maid's case is not a matter of faith. How could it\r\nbe so before the Pope and the Council had pronounced judgment\r\nconcerning it? Men are free to believe in her or not to believe in\r\nher. But it is a subject of edification; and it behoves men to\r\nmeditate upon it, not in a spirit of prejudice, persisting in doubt,\r\nbut with an open mind and according to the Christian faith. Following\r\nthe counsel of Gerson, kindly souls will believe that the Maid comes\r\nfrom God, just as they believe that the head of Saint Denys may be\r\nvenerated by the faithful either in the Cathedral Church of Paris or\r\nin the abbey-church of Saint Denys in France. They will think less of\r\nliteral than of spiritual truths and they will not sin by inquiring\r\ntoo closely.\r\n\r\nIn short neither the treatise of Jacques Gelu nor that of Jean Gerson\r\nbrought much light to the King and his Council. Both treatises\r\nabounded in exhortations, but they all amounted to saying: \"Be good,\r\npious and strong, let your thoughts be humble and prudent,\" Concerning\r\nthe most important point, the use to be made of Jeanne in the conduct\r\nof war, the Archbishop of Embrun wisely recommended: \"Do what the Maid\r\ncommands and prudence directs; for the rest give yourselves to works\r\nof piety and prayers of devotion.\" Such counsel was somewhat\r\nembarrassing to a captain like the Sire de Gaucourt and even to a man\r\nof worth like my Lord of Treves. It appears that the clerks left the\r\nKing perfect liberty of judgment and of action, and that in the end\r\nthey advised him not to believe in the Maid, but to let the people and\r\nthe men-at-arms believe in her.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten days he spent at Tours the King kept Jeanne with him.\r\nMeanwhile the Council were deliberating as to their line of\r\naction.[1136] The royal treasury was empty. Charles could raise enough\r\nmoney to make gifts to the gentlemen of his household, but he had\r\ngreat difficulty in defraying the expenses of war.[1137] Pay was owing\r\nto the people of Orleans. They had received little and spent much.\r\nTheir resources were exhausted and they demanded payment. In May and\r\nin June the King distributed among the captains, who had defended the\r\ntown, sums amounting to forty-one thousand six hundred and thirty-one\r\nlivres.[1138] He had gained his victory cheaply. The total cost of\r\nthe defence of Orleans was one hundred and ten thousand livres. The\r\ntownsfolk did the rest; they gave even their little silver\r\nspoons.[1139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1136: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 12, 72, 76, 80. _Chronique de\r\nla Pucelle_, p. 298. _Journal du siege_, p. 93. _Chronique de la\r\nfete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 299.

Couret, _Un fragment inedit des anciens registres\r\nde la Prevote d'Orleans_.]\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless have been expedient to attempt to destroy that\r\nformidable army of Sir John Fastolf which had lately terrified the\r\ngood folk of Orleans. But no one knew where to find it. It had\r\ndisappeared somewhere between Orleans and Paris. It would have been\r\nnecessary to go forth to seek it; that was impossible, and no one\r\nthought of doing such a thing. So scientific a manoeuvre was never\r\ndreamed of in the warfare of those days. An expedition to Normandy was\r\nsuggested; and the idea was so natural that the King was already\r\nimagined to be at Rouen.[1140] Finally it was decided to attempt the\r\ncapture of the chateaux the English held on the Loire, both below and\r\nabove Orleans, Jargeau, Meung, Beaugency.[1141] A useful undertaking\r\nand one which presented no very great difficulties, unless it involved\r\nan encounter with Sir John Fastolf's army, and whether it would or no\r\nit was impossible to tell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1140: Morosini, vol. iii, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1141: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 9, 10.]\r\n\r\nWithout further delay my Lord the Bastard marched on Jargeau with a\r\nfew knights and some of Poton's soldiers of fortune; but the Loire was\r\nhigh and its waters filled the trenches. Being unprovided with siege\r\ntrain, they retreated after having inflicted some hurt on the English\r\nand slain the commander of the town.[1142]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1142: _Journal du siege_, p. 93. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 300.]\r\n\r\nBy the reasons of the captains the Maid set little store. She listened\r\nto her Voices alone, and they spoke to her words which were infinitely\r\nsimple. Her one idea was to accomplish her mission. Saint Catherine,\r\nSaint Margaret and Saint Michael the Archangel, had sent her into\r\nFrance not to calculate the resources of the royal treasury, not to\r\ndecree aids and taxes, not to treat with men-at-arms, with merchants\r\nand the conductors of convoys, not to draw up plans of campaign and\r\nnegotiate truces, but to lead the Dauphin to his anointing. Wherefore\r\nit was to Reims that she wished to take him, not that she knew how to\r\ngo there, but she believed that God would guide her. Delay, tardiness,\r\ndeliberation saddened and irritated her. When with the King she urged\r\nhim gently.\r\n\r\nMany times she said to him: \"I shall live a year, barely longer.\r\nDuring that year let as much as possible be done.\"[1143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1143: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nThen she enumerated the four charges which she must accomplish during\r\nthat time. After having delivered Orleans she must drive the _Godons_\r\nout of France, lead the King to be crowned and anointed at Reims and\r\nrescue the Duke of Orleans from the hands of the English.[1144] One\r\nday she grew impatient and went to the King when he was in one of\r\nthose closets of carved wainscot constructed in the great castle halls\r\nfor intimate or family gatherings. She knocked at the door and entered\r\nalmost immediately. There she found the King conversing with Maitre\r\nGerard Machet, his confessor, my Lord the Bastard, the Sire de Treves\r\nand a favourite noble of his household, by name Messire Christophe\r\nd'Harcourt. She knelt embracing the King's knees (for she was\r\nconversant with the rules of courtesy), and said to him: \"Fair\r\nDauphin, do not so long and so frequently deliberate in council, but\r\ncome straightway to Reims, there to receive your rightful\r\nanointing.\"[1145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1144: _Ibid._, p. 99 (evidence of the Duke of Alencon).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1145: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 12. _Journal du siege_, p. 93.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 299.]\r\n\r\nThe King looked graciously upon her but answered nothing. The Lord\r\nd'Harcourt, having heard that the Maid held converse with angels and\r\nsaints, was curious to know whether the idea of taking the King to\r\nReims had really been suggested to her by her heavenly visitants.\r\nDescribing them by the word she herself used, he asked: \"Is it your\r\nCouncil who speak to you of such things?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Yes, in this matter I am urged forward.\" Straightway my\r\nLord d'Harcourt responded: \"Will you not here in the King's presence\r\ntell us the manner of your Council when they speak to you?\"\r\n\r\nAt this request Jeanne blushed.\r\n\r\nWilling to spare her constraint and embarrassment, the King said\r\nkindly: \"Jeanne, does it please you to answer this question before\r\nthese persons here present?\"\r\n\r\nBut Jeanne addressing my Lord d'Harcourt said: \"I understand what you\r\ndesire to know and I will tell you willingly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd straightway she gave the King to understand what agony she endured\r\nat not being understood and she told of her inward consolation:\r\n\"Whenever I am sad because what I say by command of Messire is not\r\nreadily believed, I go apart and to Messire I make known my complaint,\r\nsaying that those to whom I speak are not willing to believe me. And\r\nwhen I have finished my prayer, straightway I hear a voice saying unto\r\nme: 'Daughter of God, go, I will be thy help.' And this voice fills me\r\nwith so great a joy, that in this condition I would forever\r\nstay.\"[1146]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1146: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 12 (evidence of Dunois).]\r\n\r\nWhile she was repeating the words spoken by the Voice, Jeanne raised\r\nher eyes to heaven. The nobles present were struck by the divine\r\nexpression on the maiden's face. But those eyes bathed in tears, that\r\nair of rapture, which filled my Lord the Bastard with amazement, was\r\nnot an ecstasy, it was the imitation of an ecstasy.[1147] The scene\r\nwas at once simple and artificial. It reveals the kindness of the\r\nKing, who was incapable of wounding the child in any way, and the\r\nlight-heartedness with which the nobles of the court believed or\r\npretended to believe in the most wonderful marvels. It proves likewise\r\nthat henceforth the little Saint's dignifying the project of the\r\ncoronation with the authority of a divine revelation was favourably\r\nregarded by the Royal Council.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1147: _Ibid._, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid accompanied the King to Loches and stayed with him until\r\nafter the 23rd of May.[1148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1148: _Ibid._, p. 116, vol. iv, p. 245.]\r\n\r\nThe people believed in her. As she passed through the streets of\r\nLoches they threw themselves before her horse; they kissed the Saint's\r\nhands and feet. Maitre Pierre de Versailles, a monk of Saint-Denys in\r\nFrance, one of her interrogators at Poitiers, seeing her receive these\r\nmarks of veneration, rebuked her on theological grounds: \"You do\r\nwrong,\" he said, \"to suffer such things to which you are not entitled.\r\nTake heed: you are leading men into idolatry.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne, reflecting on the pride which might creep into her heart,\r\nsaid: \"In truth I could not keep from it, were not Messire watching\r\nover me.\"[1149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1149: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nShe was displeased to see certain old wives coming to salute her; that\r\nwas a kind of adoration which alarmed her. But poor folk who came to\r\nher she never repulsed. She would not hurt them, but aided them as far\r\nas she could.[1150]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1150: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nWith marvellous rapidity the fame of her holiness had been spread\r\nabroad throughout the whole of France. Many pious persons were wearing\r\nmedals of lead or some other metal, stamped with her portrait,\r\naccording to the customary mode of honouring the memory of\r\nsaints.[1151] Paintings or sculptured figures of her were placed in\r\nchapels. At mass the priest recited as a collect \"the Maid's prayer\r\nfor the realm of France:\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1151: _Ibid._, pp. 290, 291. A.

Through Our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.\"[1153]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1152: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 104. I read _in se sperantes_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1153: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 104. Lanery d'Arc, _Le culte de\r\nJeanne d'Arc au XV'e siecle_, 1886, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nIn those days the saintly, both men and women, were consulted in all\r\nthe difficulties of life. The more they were deemed simple and\r\ninnocent the more counsel was asked of them. For if of themselves they\r\nknew nothing then all the surer was it that the voice of God was to be\r\nheard in their words. The Maid was believed to have no intelligence of\r\nher own, wherefore she was held capable of solving the most difficult\r\nquestions with infallible wisdom. It was observed that knowing nought\r\nof the arts of war, she waged war better than captains, whence it was\r\nconcluded that everything, which in her holy ignorance she undertook,\r\nshe would worthily accomplish. Thus at Toulouse it occurred to a\r\n_capitoul_ to consult her on a financial question. In that city the\r\nindignation of the townsfolk had been aroused because the guardians of\r\nthe mint had been ordered to issue coins greatly inferior to those\r\nwhich had been previously in circulation. From April till June the\r\n_capitouls_ had been endeavouring to get this order revoked. On the\r\n2nd of June, the _capitoul_, Pierre Flamenc, proposed that the Maid\r\nshould be written to concerning the evils resulting from the\r\ncorruption of the coinage and that she should be asked to suggest a\r\nremedy. Pierre Flamenc made this proposal at the Capitole because he\r\nthought that a saint was a good counsellor in all matters, especially\r\nin anything which concerned the coinage, particularly when, like the\r\nMaid, she was the friend of the King.[1154]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1154: A. Thomas, _Le siege d'Orleans, Jeanne d'Arc et les\r\ncapitouls de Toulouse_, in _Annales du Midi_, 1889, pp. 235, 236.]\r\n\r\nFrom Loches Jeanne sent a little gold ring to the Dame de Laval, who\r\nhad doubtless asked for some object she had touched.[1155] Fifty-four\r\nyears previously Jeanne Dame de Laval had married Sire Bertrand Du\r\nGuesclin whose memory the French venerated and who in the House of\r\nOrleans was known as the tenth of _Les Preux_. Dame Jeanne's renown,\r\nhowever, fell short of that of Tiphaine Raguenel, astrologer and\r\nfairy,[1156] who had been Sire Bertrand's first wife. Jeanne was a\r\ncholeric person and a miser. Driven out of her domain of Laval by the\r\nEnglish, she lived in retirement at Vitre with her daughter Anne.\r\nThirteen years before, the latter had incurred her mother's\r\ndispleasure by secretly marrying a landless younger son of a noble\r\nhouse. When Dame Jeanne discovered it she imprisoned her daughter in a\r\ndungeon and welcomed the younger son by shooting at him with a\r\ncross-bow. After which the two ladies dwelt together in peace.[1157]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1155: Letter from the Lavals, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 109.\r\nBertrand de Broussillon, _La maison de Laval, les Montfort-Laval_,\r\nParis, 1900, in 8vo, vol. iii, p. 75.

Here, shortly before had met the three estates of the\r\nkingdom; and here the troops were now gathering.[1158]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1158: Letter from Gui de Laval, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 105.\r\nLucien Jeny and P. Lanery d'Arc, _Jeanne d'Arc en Berry_, Paris, s.d.\r\nin 8vo, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 4th of June, she received a herald sent by the people\r\nof Orleans to bring her tidings of the English.[1159] As commander in\r\nwar they recognised none but her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1159: Fortress accounts in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 262.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, surrounded by monks, and side by side with men-at-arms,\r\nlike a nun she lived apart, a saintly life. She ate and drank\r\nlittle.[1160] She communicated once a week and confessed\r\nfrequently.[1161] During mass at the moment of elevation, at\r\nconfession and when she received the body of Our Lord she used to weep\r\nmany tears. Every evening, at the hour of vespers, she would retire\r\ninto a church and have the bells rung for about half an hour to summon\r\nthe mendicant friars who followed the army. Then she would begin to\r\npray while the brethren sang an anthem in honour of the Virgin\r\nMary.[1162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1160: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 3, 9, 15, 18, 22, 69, 219,\r\n_passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1161: _Ibid._, vol. v, under the words _Confession_ and\r\n_Communion_. The Duke of Alencon says twice a week (_Ibid._, vol. iii,\r\np. 100).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1162: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 14; vol. ii, pp. 420, 424.]\r\n\r\nWhile practising as far as she was able the austerities required by\r\nextreme piety, she appeared magnificently attired, like a lord, for\r\nindeed she held her lordship from God. She wore the dress of a knight,\r\na small hat, doublet and hose to match, a fine cloak of silk and cloth\r\nof gold well lined and shoes laced on the outer side of the\r\nfoot.[1163] Such attire in no wise scandalised even the most austere\r\nmembers of the Dauphin's party. They read in holy Scripture that\r\nEsther and Judith, inspired by the Lord, loaded themselves with\r\nornaments; true it was for sexual reasons and in order for the\r\nsalvation of Israel to attract Ahasuerus and Holophernes. Wherefore\r\nthey held that when Jeanne decked herself with masculine adornments,\r\nin order to appear before the men-at-arms as an angel giving victory\r\nto the Christian King, far from yielding to the vanities of the world,\r\nshe, like Esther and Judith, had nothing in her heart but the interest\r\nof the holy nation and the glory of God. The English and Burgundian\r\nclerks on the other hand converted into scandal what was a subject of\r\nedification, and maintained that she was a woman dissolute in dress\r\nand in manners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1163: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 220, 253; vol. ii, pp. 294, 438.\r\n_Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, p. 60.

It was when the bells were ringing,\r\nat the hour of compline and of matins, that she could best hear their\r\nwords.[1164] In those days bells of all kinds, large and small,\r\nmetropolitan, parochial or conventual, sounded in peals, or, chiming\r\nharmoniously, in voices grave or gay, spoke to all men and of all\r\nthings. Their song descended from the sky to mark the ecclesiastical\r\nand civic calendar. They called priests and people to church; they\r\nmourned for the dead and they praised God; they announced fairs and\r\nfield work; they clashed portentous tidings through the sky, and in\r\ntimes of war they called to arms and sounded the alarm. Friendly to\r\nthe husbandman they scattered the tempest, they warded off hail-storms\r\nand drove away pestilence. They put to flight those demons that,\r\nflying ceaselessly through the air, haunt the children of men; and to\r\ntheir blessed sound was attributed the power of calming\r\nviolence.[1165] Saint Catharine, she who visited Jeanne every day,\r\nwas the patron of bells and bell-ringers. Thus many bells bore her\r\nname. In the ringing of bells as in the rustling of leaves, Jeanne was\r\nwont to hear her Voices. She seldom heard them without seeing a light\r\nin the direction whence they came.[1166] Those Voices called her:\r\n\"Jeanne, daughter of God!\"[1167] Often the Archangel and the Saints\r\nappeared to her. When they came she did them reverence, bending her\r\nknee and bowing her head; she kissed their feet, knowing it to be a\r\ngreater mark of respect than kissing the countenance. She was\r\nconscious of the fragrance and grateful warmth of their glorified\r\nbodies.[1168]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1164: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 61, 62, 481.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1165: P. Blavignac, _La cloche_, Geneva, 1877, in 8vo.

There accompanied him\r\nangels so numerous and so tiny that they danced like sparks in the\r\ndamsel's dazzled eyes. When the saints and the Archangel went away,\r\nshe wept with grief because they had not taken her with them.[1169] In\r\nlike manner an angel visited Judith in the camp of Holofernes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1169: _Ibid._, pp. 72, 75.]\r\n\r\nOne day Jeanne's equerry, Jean d'Aulon, asked her what her Council\r\nwas, just as my Lord d'Harcourt had done. She replied that she had\r\nthree councillors, one of whom was always with her. Another was\r\nconstantly going and coming; the third was the one with whom the other\r\ntwo deliberated.\r\n\r\nSire d'Aulon, more curious than the King, besought and requested her\r\nto let him see this Council for once.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Your virtues are not great enough and you are not worthy\r\nto behold it.\"[1170]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1170: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 219, 220.]\r\n\r\nThe good squire never asked again. If he had read the Bible he would\r\nhave known that Elisha's servant did not see the angels beheld by the\r\nprophet (2 Kings VI, 16, 17).\r\n\r\nAnd yet Jeanne imagined that her Council had appeared to the King and\r\nhis court.\r\n\r\n\"My King,\" she said later, \"my King and many besides saw and heard the\r\nVoices that came to me. The Count of Clermont and two or three others\r\nwere with him.\"[1171]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1171: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nShe believed it was so. But in reality she never showed her Voices to\r\nanyone. Not even, despite what has been said to the contrary, to that\r\nGuy de Cailly who had been following her since Checy.[1172]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1172: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 342. Guy de Cailly's patent of\r\nnobility cannot be regarded as authentic. Vallet de Viriville, _Petit\r\ntraite...._ p. 92.]\r\n\r\nWith Brother Pasquerel Jeanne engaged in pious conversation. To him\r\nshe often expressed the desire that the Church after her death should\r\npray for her and for all the French slain in the war.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to depart from this world,\" she used to say to him, \"I\r\nshould like the King to build chantries, where prayers should be\r\noffered to Messire for the salvation of the souls of those who died in\r\nwar or for the defence of the realm.\"[1173]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1173: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nSuch a wish was common to all devout souls. What Christian in those\r\ndays did not hold the practice of saying masses for the dead to be\r\ngood and salutary? Thus, in the matter of devotion, the Maid was in\r\naccord with Duke Charles of Orleans, who, in one of his complaints,\r\nrecommends the saying and singing of masses for the souls of those who\r\nhad suffered violent death in the service of the realm.[1174]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1174: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 112. _Poesies de Charles\r\nd'Orleans_, ed. A. Champollion-Figeac, p. 174.]\r\n\r\nShe said one day to the good brother: \"There is succour that I am\r\nappointed to bring.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Pasquerel, albeit he had studied the Bible, cried out in\r\namazement: \"Such a history as yours there hath never been before in\r\nthe world. Nought like unto it can be read in any book.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne answered him even more boldly than the doctors at Poitiers:\r\n\"Messire has a book in which no clerk, however perfect his learning,\r\nhas ever read.\"[1175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1175: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 108, 109.]\r\n\r\nShe had received her mission from God alone, and she read in a book\r\nsealed against all the doctors of the Church.\r\n\r\nOn the reverse of her standard, sprinkled by mendicants with holy\r\nwater, she had had a dove painted, holding in its beak a scroll,\r\nwhereon were written the words \"in the name of the King of\r\nHeaven.\"[1176] These were the armorial bearings she had received from\r\nher Council. The emblem and the device seemed appropriate to her,\r\nsince she proclaimed that God had sent her, and since at Orleans she\r\nhad given the sign promised at Poitiers. The King, notwithstanding,\r\nchanged this shield for arms representing a crown supported upon a\r\nsword between two flowers-de-luce and indicating clearly what was the\r\naid that the Maid of God was bringing to the realm of France. It is\r\nsaid that she regretted having to abandon the arms communicated to her\r\nby divine revelation.[1177]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1176: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 78, 117, 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1177: _Ibid._, pp. 117, 300; vol. v, p. 227.]\r\n\r\nShe prophesied, and, as happens to all prophets, she did not always\r\nforetell what was to come to pass. It was the fate of the prophet\r\nJonah himself. And doctors explain how the prophecies of true prophets\r\ncannot be all fulfilled.\r\n\r\nShe had said: \"Before Saint John the Baptist's Day, in 1429, there\r\nshall not be one Englishman, howsoever strong and valiant, to be seen\r\nthroughout France, either in battle or in the open field.\"[1178]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1178: Letter written from Germany, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n351. Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 33, 46, 62.]\r\n\r\nThe nativity of Saint John the Baptist is celebrated on the 24th of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF JARGEAU--THE BRIDGE OF MEUNG--BEAUGENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 6th of June, the King lodged at Saint-Aignan near\r\nSelles-en-Berry.[1179] Among the gentlemen of his company were two\r\nsons of that Dame de Laval who, in her widowhood, had made the mistake\r\nof loving a landless cadet. Andre, the younger, at the age of twenty,\r\nhad just passed under the cloud of a disgrace common to nearly all\r\nnobles in those days; his grandmother's second husband, Sire Bertrand\r\nDu Guesclin, had experienced it several times. Taken prisoner in the\r\nchateau of Laval by Sir John Talbot, he had incurred a heavy debt in\r\norder to furnish the sixteen thousand golden crowns of his\r\nransom.[1180]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1179: Letter from Gui and Andre de Laval to the Ladies de\r\nLaval, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 106. L. Jeny and Lanery d'Arc, _Jeanne\r\nD'Arc en Berry_, Paris, 1892, in 8vo, p. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1180: Bertrand de Broussillon, _La maison de Laval_, vol.\r\niii, p. 21.]\r\n\r\nBeing in great need of money, the two young nobles offered their\r\nservices to the King, who received them very well, gave them not a\r\ncrown, but said he would show them the Maid. And as he was going with\r\nthem from Saint-Aignan to Selles, he summoned the Saint,[1181] who\r\nstraightway, armed at all points save her head, and lance in hand,\r\nrode out to meet the King. She greeted the two young nobles heartily\r\nand returned with them to Selles. The eldest, Lord Guy, she received\r\nin the house where she was lodging, opposite the church, and called\r\nfor wine. Such was the custom among princes. Cups of wine were\r\nbrought, into which the guests dipped slices of bread called\r\nsops.[1182] When offering him the wine cup, the Maid said to Lord Guy:\r\n\"I will shortly give you to drink at Paris.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1181: Letter from Gui and Andre de Laval, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, pp. 106 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1182: N. Villiaume, _Histoire de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 88.]\r\n\r\nShe told him that, three days before, she had sent a gold ring to Dame\r\nJeanne de Laval.\r\n\r\n\"It was a small matter,\" she added graciously. \"I should like to have\r\nsent her something of greater value, considering her reputation.\"[1183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1183: _Recommandation_ in French. The esteem in which she\r\nwas held. Compare Froissart cited by La Curne, Glossary, _ad v. \"Six\r\nbourgeois de la ville de Calais et de plus grande recommandation.\"_\r\n(\"Six citizens of Calais and of the highest reputation.\")]\r\n\r\nThat same day, at the hour of vespers, she set out from Selles for\r\nRomorantin with a numerous company of men-at-arms and train-bands,\r\ncommanded by Marshal de Boussac. She was surrounded by mendicant\r\nfriars and one of her brothers went with her. She wore white armour\r\nand a hood. Her horse was brought to her at the door of her house. It\r\nwas a great black charger which resolutely refused to let her mount\r\nhim. She had him led to the Cross by the roadside, opposite the\r\nchurch, and there she leapt into the saddle. Whereupon Lord Guy\r\nmarvelled; for he saw that the charger was as still as if he had been\r\nbound. She turned her horse's head towards the church porch, and in\r\nher clear woman's voice cried: \"Ye priests and churchmen, walk in\r\nprocessions and pray to God.\"\r\n\r\nThen, gaining the highroad: \"Go forward, go forward,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn her hand she carried a little axe. Her page bore her standard\r\nfurled.[1184]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1184: Letter from Gui and Andre de Laval, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, pp. 106, 107.]\r\n\r\nThe meeting-place was Orleans. On Thursday, the 9th of June, in the\r\nevening, Jeanne passed over the bridge she had crossed on the 8th of\r\nMay. Saturday, the 11th, the army set out for Jargeau.[1185] It\r\nconsisted of horse brought by the Duke of Alencon, the Count of\r\nVendome, the Bastard, the Marshal de Boussac, Captain La Hire, Messire\r\nFlorent d'Illiers, Messire Jamet du Tillay, Messire Thudal de\r\nKermoisan of Brittany, as well as of contingents furnished by the\r\ncommunes, in all, perhaps eight thousand combatants, many of whom were\r\narmed with pikes, axes, cross-bows and leaden mallets.[1186] The young\r\nDuke of Alencon was placed in command. He was not remarkable for his\r\nintelligence.[1187] But he knew how to ride, and in those days that\r\nwas the only knowledge indispensable to a general. Again the people of\r\nOrleans defrayed the cost of the expedition. For the payment of the\r\nfighting men they contributed three thousand livres, for their\r\nfeeding, seven hogsheads of corn. At their own request, the King\r\nimposed on them a new _taille_ of three thousand livres.[1188] At\r\ntheir own expense they despatched workmen of all trades,--masons,\r\ncarpenters, smiths. They lent their artillery. They sent culverins,\r\ncannons, La Bergere, and the large mortar to which four horses were\r\nharnessed, with the gunners Megret and Jean Boilleve.[1189] They\r\nfurnished ammunition, engines, arrows, ladders, pickaxes, spades,\r\nmattocks; and all were marked, for they were a methodical folk.\r\nEverything for the siege was sent to the Maid. For in this undertaking\r\nshe was the one commander they recognised, not the Duke of Alencon,\r\nnot even the Bastard their own lord's noble brother. For the\r\ninhabitants of Orleans, Jeanne was the leader of the siege; and to\r\nJeanne, before the besieged town, they despatched two of their\r\ncitizens,--Jean Leclerc and Francois Joachim.[1190] After the citizens\r\nof Orleans, the Sire de Rais contributed most to the expenses of the\r\nsiege of Jargeau.[1191] This unfortunate noble spent thoughtlessly\r\nright and left, while rich burgesses made great profits by lending to\r\nhim at a high rate of interest. The sorry state of his affairs was\r\nshortly to bring him to attempt their readjustment by vowing his soul\r\nto the devil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1185: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 94; vol. iv, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1186: _Mistere du siege_, line 15,761. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 95. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 299.

Warned\r\nthat the army of the French King was coming to besiege it, the Earl of\r\nSuffolk and his two brothers threw themselves into the town, with five\r\nhundred knights, squires, and other fighting men, as well as two\r\nhundred picked bowmen.[1194] The Duke of Alencon with six hundred\r\nhorse was at the head of the force, and with him, the Maid. The first\r\nnight they slept in the woods.[1195] On the morrow, at daybreak, my\r\nLord the Bastard, my Lord Florent d'Illiers, and several other\r\ncaptains joined them. They were in a great hurry to reach Jargeau.\r\nSuddenly they hear that Sir John Fastolf is at hand, coming from Paris\r\nwith two thousand combatants, bringing supplies and artillery to\r\nJargeau.[1196]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1192: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1193: Berry, in the _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1194: _Journal du siege_, p. 96. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 299. _Chronique de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 295.

Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 452.]\r\n\r\nThis was the army which had been the cause of Jeanne's anxiety on the\r\n4th of May, because her saints had not told her where Fastolf was. The\r\ncaptains held a council of war. Many thought the siege ought to be\r\nabandoned and that the army should go to meet Fastolf. Some actually\r\nwent off at once. Jeanne exhorted the men-at-arms to continue their\r\nmarch on Jargeau. Where Sir John Fastolf's army was, she knew no more\r\nthan the others; her reasons were not of this world.\r\n\r\n\"Be not afraid of any armed host whatsoever,\" she said, \"and make no\r\ndifficulty of attacking the English, for Messire leads you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she said: \"Were I not assured that Messire leads, I would\r\nrather be keeping sheep than running so great a danger.\"\r\n\r\nShe gained a better hearing from the Duke of Alencon than from any of\r\nthe Orleans leaders.[1197] Those who had gone were recalled and the\r\nmarch on Jargeau was continued.[1198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1197: Perceval de Cagny, p. 148, _passim_. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1198: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe suburbs of the town appeared undefended; but, when the French\r\nKing's men approached, they found the English posted in front of the\r\noutbuildings, wherefore they were compelled to retreat. When the Maid\r\nbeheld this, she seized her standard and threw herself upon the enemy,\r\ncalling on the fighting men to take courage. That night, the French\r\nKing's men were able to encamp in the suburbs.[1199] They kept no\r\nwatch, and yet from the Duke of Alencon's own avowal they would have\r\nbeen in great danger if the English had made a sally.[1200] The Maid's\r\njudgment was even more fully justified than she expected. Everything\r\nin her army depended upon the grace of God.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1199: The night of Friday, the 10th to 11th of June.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1200: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe very next day, in the morning the besiegers brought their siege\r\ntrain and their mortars up to the walls. The Orleans cannon fired upon\r\nthe town and did great damage. Three of La Bergere's volleys wrecked\r\nthe greatest tower on the fortifications.[1201]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1201: _Ibid._ _Journal du siege_, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nThe train-bands reached Jargeau on Saturday, the 11th. Straightway,\r\nwithout staying to take counsel, they hastened to the trenches and\r\nbegan the assault. They were too zealous; consequently, they went\r\nbadly to work, received no aid from the men-at-arms and were driven\r\nback in disorder.[1202]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1202: Perceval de Cagny, p. 150.]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday night, the Maid, who was accustomed to summon the enemy\r\nbefore fighting, approached the entrenchments, and cried out to the\r\nEnglish: \"Surrender the town to the King of Heaven and to King\r\nCharles, and depart, or it will be the worse for you.\"[1203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1203: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nTo this summons the English paid no heed, albeit they had a great\r\ndesire to come to some understanding. The Earl of Suffolk came to my\r\nLord the Bastard, and told him that if he would refrain from the\r\nattack, the town should be surrendered to him. The English asked for a\r\nfortnight's respite, after which time, they would undertake to\r\nwithdraw immediately, they and their horses, provided, doubtless, that\r\nby that time they had not been relieved.[1204] On both sides such\r\nconditional surrenders were common. The Sire de Baudricourt had signed\r\none at Vaucouleurs just before Jeanne's arrival there.[1205] In this\r\ncase it was mere trickery to ask the French to enter into such an\r\nagreement just when Sir John Fastolf was coming with artillery and\r\nsupplies.[1206] It has been asserted that the Bastard was taken in\r\nthis snare; but such a thing is incredible; he was far too wily for\r\nthat. Nevertheless, on the morrow, which was Sunday and the 12th of\r\nthe month, the Duke of Alencon and the nobles, who were holding a\r\ncouncil concerning the measures for the capture of the town, were told\r\nthat Captain La Hire was conferring with the Earl of Suffolk. They\r\nwere highly displeased.[1207] Captain La Hire, who was not a general,\r\ncould not treat in his own name, and had doubtless received powers\r\nfrom my Lord the Bastard. The latter commanded for the Duke, a\r\nprisoner in the hands of the English, while the Duke of Alencon\r\ncommanded for the King; and hence the disagreement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1204: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 79, 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1205: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. clxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1206: _Journal du siege, Chronique de la Pucelle_, J.\r\nChartier, Monstrelet, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1207: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid, who was always ready to show mercy to prisoners when they\r\nsurrendered and at the same time always ready to fight, said: \"If they\r\nwill, let them in their jackets of mail depart from Jargeau with their\r\nlives! If they will not, the town shall be stormed.\"[1208]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1208: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 79-80, 234.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alencon, without even inquiring the terms of the\r\ncapitulation, had Captain La Hire recalled.\r\n\r\nHe came, and straightway the ladders were brought. The heralds sounded\r\nthe trumpets and cried: \"To the assault.\"\r\n\r\nThe Maid unfurled her standard, and fully armed, wearing on her head\r\none of those light helmets known as _chapelines_,[1209] she went down\r\ninto the trenches with the King's men and the train-bands, well within\r\nreach of arrows and cannon-balls. She kept by the Duke of Alencon's\r\nside, saying: \"Forward! fair duke, to the assault.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1209: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 97. Perceval de Cagny, pp.\r\n150-151.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who was not so courageous as she, thought that she went\r\nrather hastily to work; and this he gave her to understand.\r\n\r\nThen she encouraged him: \"Fear not. God's time is the right time. When\r\nHe wills it you must open the attack. Go forward, He will prepare the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nAnd seeing him lack confidence, she reminded him of the promise she had\r\nrecently made concerning him in the Abbey of Saint-Florent-les-Saumur.\r\n\"Oh! Fair Duke, can you be afraid? Do you not remember that I promised\r\nyour wife to bring you back safe and sound?\"[1210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1210: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 95-96.]\r\n\r\nIn the thick of the attack, she noticed on the wall one of those long\r\nthin mortars, which, from the manner of its charging, was called a\r\nbreechloader. Seeing it hurl stones on the very spot where the King's\r\nfair cousin was standing, she realised the danger, but not for\r\nherself. \"Move away,\" she said quickly. \"That cannon will kill you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke had not moved more than a few yards, when a nobleman of\r\nAnjou, the Sire Du Lude, having taken the place he had quitted, was\r\nkilled by a ball from that same cannon.[1211] The Duke of Alencon\r\nmarvelled at her prophetic gift. Doubtless the Maid had been sent to\r\nsave him, but she had not been sent to save the Sire Du Lude. The\r\nangels of the Lord are sent for the salvation of some, for the\r\ndestruction of others. When the French King's men reached the wall,\r\nthe Earl of Suffolk cried out for a parley with the Duke of Alencon.\r\nNo heed was paid to him and the assault continued.[1212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1211: _Ibid._, pp. 96, 97. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n301. _Journal du siege_, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1212: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nThe attack had lasted four hours,[1213] when Jeanne, standard in hand,\r\nclimbed up a ladder leaning against the rampart. A stone fired from a\r\ncannon struck her helmet and knocked it with its escutcheon, bearing\r\nher arms, off her head. They thought she was crushed, but she rose\r\nquickly and cried to the fighting men: \"Up, friends, up! Messire has\r\ndoomed the English. They are ours at this moment. Be of good\r\ncheer.\"[1214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1213: _Journal du siege_, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1214: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 97. _Journal du siege_, p. 98.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 301-302. Perceval de Cagny, pp.\r\n150-151.]\r\n\r\nThe wall was scaled and the French King's men penetrated into the\r\ntown. The English fled into La Beauce and the French rushed in pursuit\r\nof them. Guillaume Regnault, a squire of Auvergne, came up with the\r\nEarl of Suffolk on the bridge and took him prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a gentleman?\" asked Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a knight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Suffolk dubbed him a knight and surrendered to him.[1215]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1215: _Journal du siege_, p. 99. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 302. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 82. Berry, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, p. 65.]\r\n\r\nVery soon the rumour ran that the Earl of Suffolk had surrendered on\r\nhis knees to the Maid.[1216] It was even stated that he had asked to\r\nsurrender to her as to the bravest lady in the world.[1217] But it is\r\nmore likely that he would have surrendered to the lowest menial of the\r\narmy rather than to a woman whom he held to be a witch possessed of\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1216: Fragment of a letter concerning the wonders which\r\nhappened in Poitou, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1217: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, p. 340.\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 70. _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 121-122.]\r\n\r\nJohn Pole, Suffolk's brother, was likewise taken on the bridge. The\r\nDuke's third brother, Alexander Pole, was slain in the same place or\r\ndrowned in the Loire.[1218]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1218: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 72. Perceval de Cagny, p. 151.\r\n_Journal du siege_, p. 99. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 328. Morosini, vol.\r\niii, pp. 128, 129.]\r\n\r\nThe garrison surrendered at discretion. Now, as always, no great harm\r\nwas done during the battle, but afterwards the conquerors made up for\r\nit. Five hundred English were massacred; the nobles alone were held to\r\nransom. And over them, the French fell to quarrelling. The French\r\nnobles kept them all for themselves; the train-bands claimed their\r\nshare, and, not getting it, began to destroy everything. What the\r\nnobles could save was carried off during the night, by water, to\r\nOrleans. The town was completely sacked; the old church, which had\r\nserved the _Godons_ as a magazine, was pillaged.[1219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1219: _Journal du siege_, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nIncluding killed and wounded, the French had not lost twenty\r\nmen.[1220]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1220: Perceval de Cagny, p. 151. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 302. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 82, 83. Berry, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 65.]\r\n\r\nWithout disarming, the Maid and the knights returned to Orleans. To\r\ncelebrate the taking of Jargeau, the magistrates organised a public\r\nprocession. An eloquent sermon was preached by a Jacobin monk, Brother\r\nRobert Baignart.[1221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1221: Accounts of the town of Orleans at the end of _Le\r\nJournal du siege_, ed. Charpentier and Cuissard, p. 229. Le R.P.\r\nChapotin, _La guerre de cent ans, Jeanne d'Arc et les Dominicains_,\r\nParis, 1889, 8vo, p. 82.]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Orleans presented the Duke of Alencon with six\r\ncasks of wine, the Maid with four, the Count of Vendome with\r\ntwo.[1222]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1222: A. de Villaret, _Campagne des Anglais_, proofs and\r\nillustrations, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nAs an acknowledgment of the good and acceptable services rendered by\r\nthe holy maiden, the councillors of the captive Duke Charles of\r\nOrleans, gave her a green cloak and a robe of crimson Flemish cloth\r\nor fine Brussels purple. Jean Luillier, who furnished the stuff,\r\nasked eight crowns for two ells of fine Brussels at four crowns the\r\nell; two crowns for the lining of the robe; two crowns for an ell of\r\nyellowish green cloth, making in all twelve golden crowns.[1223] Jean\r\nLuillier was a young woollen draper who adored the Maid and regarded\r\nher as an angel of God. He had a good heart; but fear of the English\r\ndazzled him, and where they were concerned caused him to see\r\ndouble.[1224] One of his kinsfolk was a member of the council elected\r\nin 1429. He himself was to be appointed magistrate a little\r\nlater.[1225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1223: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 112-113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1224: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1225: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 306.]\r\n\r\nJean Bourgeois, tailor, asked one golden crown for the making of the\r\nrobe and the cloak, as well as for furnishing white satin, taffeta,\r\nand other stuffs.[1226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1226: _Ibid._, pp. 112, 114.]\r\n\r\nThe town had previously given the Maid half an ell of cloth of two\r\nshades of green worth thirty-five _sous_ of Paris to make \"nettles\"\r\nfor her gown.[1227] Nettles were the Duke of Orleans' device, green or\r\npurple or crimson his colours.[1228] This green was no longer the\r\nbright colour of earlier days, it had gradually been growing darker as\r\nthe fortunes of the house declined. It had first been a vivid green,\r\nthen a brownish shade, and, finally, the tint of the faded leaf with a\r\nsuggestion of black in it which signified sorrow and mourning. The\r\nMaid's colour was _feuillemort_. She, like the officers of the duchy\r\nand the men of the train-bands, wore the Orleans livery; and thus\r\nthey made of her a kind of herald-at-arms or heraldic angel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1227: _Accounts of the Fortress_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1228: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 106, 259. _Catalogue des Arch. de\r\nJoursanvault_, vol. i, p. 129, nos. 603, 607, 619, 645, 772.\r\nDambreville, _Abrege de l'histoire des ordres de chevalerie_, p. 167.\r\nP. Mantellier, _Histoire du siege_, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nThe cloak of yellowish green and the robe embroidered with nettles,\r\nshe must have been glad to wear for love of Duke Charles, whom the\r\nEnglish had treated with such sore despite. Having come to defend the\r\nheritage of the captive prince, she said that in Jesus' name, the good\r\nDuke of Orleans was on her mind and she was confident that she would\r\ndeliver him.[1229] Her design was first to summon the English to give\r\nhim up; then, if they refused, to cross the sea and with an army to\r\nseek him in England.[1230] In case such means failed her, she had\r\nthought of another course which she would adopt, with the permission\r\nof her saints. She would ask the King if he would let her take\r\nprisoners, believing that she could take enough to exchange for Duke\r\nCharles.[1231] Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret had promised her\r\nthat thus his deliverance would take her less than three years and\r\nlonger than one.[1232] Such were the pious dreams of a child lulled to\r\nsleep by the sound of her village bells! Deeming it just that she\r\nshould labour and suffer to rescue her princes from trouble and\r\nweariness, she used to say, like a good servant: \"I know that in\r\nmatters of bodily ease God loves my King and the Duke of Orleans\r\nbetter than me; and I know it because it hath been revealed unto\r\nme.\"[1233]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1229: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 55, 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1230: _Ibid._, p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1231: _Ibid._, p. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1232: _Ibid._, pp. 133, 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1233: _Ibid._, p. 258.]\r\n\r\nThen, speaking of the captive duke she would say: \"My Voices have\r\nrevealed much to me concerning him. Duke Charles hath oftener been the\r\nsubject of my revelations than any man living except my King.\"[1234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1234: _Ibid._, p. 55.]\r\n\r\nIn reality, all that Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret had done was\r\nto tell her of the well-known misfortunes of the Prince. Valentine of\r\nMilan's son and Isabelle Romee's daughter were separated by a gulf\r\nbroader and deeper than the ocean which stretched between them. They\r\ndwelt at the antipodes of the world of souls, and all the saints of\r\nParadise would have been unable to explain one to the other.\r\n\r\nAll the same Duke Charles was a good prince and a debonair; he was\r\nkind and he was pitiful. More than any other he possessed the gift of\r\npleasing. He charmed by his grace, albeit but ill-looking and of weak\r\nconstitution.[1235] His temperament was so out of harmony with his\r\nposition that he may be said to have endured his life rather than to\r\nhave lived it. His father assassinated by night in the Rue Barbette in\r\nParis by order of Duke John; his mother a perennial fount of tears,\r\ndying of anger and of grief in a Franciscan nunnery; the two S's,\r\nstanding for _Soupirs_ (sighs) and _Souci_ (care), the emblems and\r\ndevices of her mourning, revealing her ingenious mind fancifully\r\nelegant even in despair; the Armagnacs, the Burgundians, the\r\nCabochiens, cutting each other's throats around him; these were the\r\nsights he had witnessed when little more than a child. Then he had\r\nbeen wounded and taken prisoner at the Battle of Azincourt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1235: Bibliotheque Nationale, ms. fr. 966, fol. 1.]\r\n\r\nNow, for fourteen years, dragged from castle to castle, from one end\r\nto the other of the island of fogs; imprisoned within thick walls,\r\nclosely guarded, receiving two or three of his countrymen at long\r\nintervals, but never permitted to converse with one except before\r\nwitnesses, he felt old before his time, blighted by misfortune. \"Fruit\r\nfallen in its greenness, I was put to ripen on prison straw. I am\r\nwinter fruit,\"[1236] he said of himself. In his captivity, he suffered\r\nwithout hope, knowing that on his death-bed Henry V had recommended\r\nhis brother not to give him up at any price.[1237]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1236: _Les poesies de Charles d'Orleans_, ed. Guichard,\r\n1842, in 12mo, p. 145.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1237: A. Champollion-Figeac, _Louis et Charles, ducs\r\nd'Orleans, leur influence sur les arts, la litterature et l'esprit de\r\nleur siecle_, Paris, 1844, 1 vol. in 8vo, with an atlas, pp. 300-337.]\r\n\r\nKind to others, kind to himself, he took refuge in his own thoughts,\r\nwhich were as bright and clear as his life was dark and sad. In the\r\ngloom of the stern castles of Windsor and of Bolingbroke, in the Tower\r\nof London, side by side with his gaolers, he lived and moved in the\r\nworld of phantasy of the _Romance of the Rose_. Venus, Cupid, Hope,\r\nFair-Welcome, Pleasure, Pity, Danger, Sadness, Care, Melancholy,\r\nSweet-Looks were around the desk, on which, in the deep embrasure of a\r\nwindow, beneath the sun's rays, he wrote his ballads, as delicate and\r\nfresh as an illumination on the page of a manuscript. For him it was\r\nthe world of allegory that really existed. He wandered in the forest\r\nof Long Expectation; he embarked on the vessel Good Tidings. He was a\r\npoet; Beauty was his lady; and courteously did he sing of her. From\r\nhis verses one would say that he was but the Captive of Lord\r\nLove.[1238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1238: _Les poesies de Charles d'Orleans_, ed. A.\r\nChampollion-Figeac, Paris, 1842, 8vo. Pierre Champion, _Le manuscrit\r\nautographe des poesies de Charles d'Orleans_, Paris, 1907, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nHe was left in ignorance of the affairs of his duchy; and, if he ever\r\nconcerned himself about it, it was when he collected the books of King\r\nCharles V which had been bought by the Duke of Bedford and resold to\r\nLondon merchants;[1239] or when he commanded that on the approach of\r\nthe English to Blois, its fine tapestries and his father's library\r\nshould be carried off to La Rochelle. After Beauty rich hangings and\r\ndelicate miniatures were what he loved most in the world.[1240] The\r\nbright sunshine of France, the lovely month of May, dancing and ladies\r\nwere what he longed for most. He was cured of prowess and of chivalry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1239: L. Delisle, _Recherches sur la librairie de Charles V_\r\n(1907), vol. i, p. 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1240: Le Roux de Lincy, _La bibliotheque de Charles\r\nd'Orleans a son chateau de Blois, en 1427_, Paris, 1843, 8vo, pp. 5-7.\r\nComte de Laborde, _Les ducs de Bourgogne, etudes sur les lettres, les\r\narts et l'industrie pendant le XV'e siecle_, Paris, 1852, vol. iii,\r\npp. 235 _et seq._--_Inventaires et documents relatifs aux joyaux et\r\ntapisseries des princes d'Orleans-Valois_, Paris, 1894, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nSome have wished to believe that from his duchy news reached him of\r\nthe Maid's coming. They have gone so far as to imagine that a faithful\r\nservant kept him informed of the happy incidents of May and June,\r\n1429;[1241] but nothing is less certain. On the contrary, the\r\nprobability is that the English refused to let him receive any\r\nmessage, and that he was totally ignorant of all that was going on in\r\nthe two kingdoms.[1242]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1241: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, Introduction by Vallet de\r\nViriville, pp. 8, 19 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1242: With regard to the year 1433, this is well established\r\n(_Poesies completes de Charles d'Orleans_, ed. Charles d'Hericault,\r\nParis, 1874, 2 vols. 8vo, introduction).]\r\n\r\nPossibly he did not care for news of the war as much as one might\r\nexpect. He hoped nothing from men-at-arms; and it was not to his fair\r\ncousins of France and to feats of prowess and battles that he looked\r\nfor deliverance. He knew too much about them. It was in peace that he\r\nput his trust, both for himself and for his people. Since the fathers\r\nwere dead, he thought that the sons might forgive and forget. He\r\nplaced his hope in his cousin of Burgundy; and he was right, for the\r\nfortunes of the English were in the hands of Duke Philip. Charles\r\nbrought himself, or at any rate he was to bring himself later, to\r\nrecognise the suzerainty of the King of England. It is less important\r\nto consider the weakness of men than the force of circumstances. And\r\nthe prisoner could never do enough to obtain peace: \"joy's greatest\r\ntreasure.\"[1243]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1243: _Poesies de Charles d'Orleans_, ed. A.\r\nChampollion-Figeac, pp. 175-176.]\r\n\r\nNo, despite her revelations, the picture Jeanne imagined of her fair\r\nDuke was not the true one. They were never to meet; but if they had\r\nmet there would have been serious misunderstandings between them, and\r\nthey would have remained incomprehensible one to the other. Jeanne's\r\nelemental, straight-forward way of thinking could never have accorded\r\nwith the ideas of so great a noble and so courteous a poet. They could\r\nnever have understood each other because she was simple, he subtle;\r\nbecause she was a prophetess while he was filled with courtly\r\nknowledge and lettered grace; because she believed, and he was as one\r\nnot believing; because she was a daughter of the common folk and a\r\nsaint ascribing all sovereignty to God, while for him law consisted in\r\nfeudal uses and customs, alliances and treaties;[1244] because, in\r\nshort, they held conflicting ideas concerning life and the world. The\r\nMaid's mission, her being sent by Messire to recover his duchy for\r\nhim, would never have appealed to the good Duke; and Jeanne would\r\nnever have understood his behaviour towards his English and Burgundian\r\ncousins. It was better they should never meet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1244: For him every treaty of peace was a good treaty, even\r\nthat of 1420, the Treaty of Troyes (Pierre Champion, _Le manuscrit\r\nautographe des poesies de Charles d'Orleans_, Paris, 1907, 8vo, p.\r\n32).]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Jargeau had given the French control of the upper\r\nLoire. In order to free the city of Orleans from all danger, it was\r\nnecessary to make sure of the banks of the lower river. There the\r\nEnglish still held Meung and Beaugency. On Tuesday, the 14th of June,\r\nat the hour of vespers, the army took the field.[1245]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1245: Perceval de Cagny, p. 152: \"_Je veux demain, apres\r\ndiner, aller voir ceux de Meung_.\" [\"To-morrow after dinner I will go\r\nto the people of Meung.\"] The turn of expression which this chronicle\r\nattributes to Jeanne is really that of the clerk who wrote it.]\r\n\r\nThey passed through La Sologne, and that same evening gained the\r\nBridge of Meung, situated above the town and separated from its walls\r\nby a broad meadow. Like most bridges, it was defended by a castlet at\r\neach end; and the English had provided it with an earthen outwork, as\r\nthey had done for Les Tourelles at Orleans.[1246] They defended it\r\nbadly, however, and the French King's men forced their way in before\r\nnightfall. They left a garrison there, and went out to encamp in\r\nBeauce, almost under the walls. The young Duke of Alencon lodged in a\r\nchurch with a few men-at-arms; and, as was his wont, did not keep\r\nwatch. He was surprised and ran great danger.[1247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1246: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 71, 97, 110. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 305. _Journal du siege_, p. 101.

Straight in front of them rose its square\r\ntower of somewhat proud aspect, although it had oftentimes been taken.\r\nThe suburbs were not fortified; but the French, when they entered\r\nthem, were riddled by a shower of arrows of every kind, fired by\r\narchers concealed in dwellings and outhouses. On both sides there were\r\nkilled and wounded. Finally, the English retreated into the castle and\r\nthe bridge bastions.[1249]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1249: _Journal du siege_, p. 101. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 304. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alencon stationed sentinels in front of the castle to\r\nwatch the English. Just then, he saw coming towards him, two nobles of\r\nBrittany, the Lords of Rostrenen and of Kermoisan, who said to him:\r\n\"The Constable asks the besiegers for entertainment.\"[1250]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1250: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 97, 98. Gruel, _Chronique de\r\nRichemont_, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nArthur of Brittany, Sire de Richemont, Constable of France, had spent\r\nthe winter in Poitou waging war against the troops of the Sire de La\r\nTremouille. Now in defiance of the King's prohibition the Constable\r\ncame to join the King's men.[1251] He had crossed the Loire at Amboise\r\nand arrived before Beaugency with six hundred men-at-arms and four\r\nhundred archers.[1252] His coming caused the captains great\r\nembarrassment. Some esteemed him a man of strong will and great\r\ncourage. But many were dependent upon the Sire de La Tremouille, as\r\nfor example the poor squire, Jean d'Aulon. The Duke of Alencon wanted\r\nto retreat, alleging that the King had commanded him not to receive\r\nthe Constable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1251: E. Cosneau, _Le connetable de Richemont_, pp. 93 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1252: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 315, 516. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 84. _Journal du siege_, pp. 101, 102. Perceval\r\nde Cagny, p. 153.]\r\n\r\n\"If the Constable comes, I shall retire,\" he said to Jeanne.\r\n\r\nTo the Breton nobles he replied, that if the Constable came into the\r\ncamp, the Maid, and the besiegers would fight against him.[1253]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1253: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 98. E. Cosneau, _Le connetable\r\nde Richemont_, p. 168.]\r\n\r\nSo decided was he that he mounted his horse to ride straight up to the\r\nBretons. The Maid, out of respect for him and for the King, was\r\npreparing to follow him. But many of the captains restrained the Duke\r\nof Alencon[1254] deeming that now was not the time to break a lance\r\nwith the Constable of France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1254: Gruel, _Chronique de Richemont_, pp. 70 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow a loud alarm was sounded in the camp. The heralds were\r\ncrying: \"To arms!\" The English were said to be approaching in great\r\nnumbers. The young Duke still wanted to retreat in order to avoid\r\nreceiving the Constable. This time Jeanne dissuaded him: \"We must\r\nstand together,\" she said.[1255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1255: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 98.]\r\n\r\nHe listened to this counsel and went forth to meet the Constable,\r\nfollowed by the Maid, my Lord the Bastard, and the Lords of Laval.\r\nNear the leper's hospital at Beaugency they encountered a fine\r\ncompany. As they approached, a thick-lipped little man, dark and\r\nfrowning, alighted from his horse.[1256] It was Arthur of Brittany.\r\nThe Maid embraced his knees as she was accustomed to do when holding\r\nconverse with the great ones of heaven and earth. Thus did every baron\r\nwhen he met one nobler than himself.[1257]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1256: Gruel, _Chronique de Richemont_, p. 71. Cf. E.\r\nCosneau, _Le connetable de Richemont_, pp. 169, 583. See a drawing in\r\nthe Gaignieres collection reproduced by J. Lair, _Essai sur la\r\nbataille de Formigny_, 1903, 8vo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1257: _Lors le saluerent et le vinrent accoller par les\r\njambes._ (Then they saluted him and embraced his knees.) J. de Bueil,\r\n_Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 191.]\r\n\r\nThe Constable spoke to her as a good Catholic, a devout servant of God\r\nand the Church, saying: \"Jeanne, I have heard that you wanted to fight\r\nagainst me. Whether you are sent by God I know not. If you are I do\r\nnot fear you. For God knows that my heart is right. If you are sent by\r\nthe devil I fear you still less.\"[1258]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1258: Gruel, _Chronique de Richemont_, pp. 71-72. I have\r\nhere followed Gruel, who is not generally very trustworthy, but whose\r\naccount in this particular seems probable, at least he is no mere\r\nhagiographer.]\r\n\r\nHe was entitled to speak thus, for he made a point of never\r\nacknowledging the devil's power over him. His love of God he showed by\r\nseeking out wizards and witches with a greater zeal than was displayed\r\nby bishops and inquisitors. In France, in Poitou, and in Brittany he\r\nhad sent more to the stake than any other man living.[1259]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1259: _Ibid._, p. 228.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alencon dared not either dismiss him or grant him a\r\nlodging for the night. It was the custom for new comers to keep the\r\nwatch. The Constable with his company kept watch that night in front\r\nof the castle.[1260]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1260: _Ibid._, p. 72. E. Cosneau, _Le connetable de\r\nRichemont_, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nWithout more ado the young Duke of Alencon proceeded to the attack.\r\nHere, again, those who bore the brunt of the attack and provided for\r\nthe siege were the citizens of Orleans. The magistrates of the town\r\nhad sent by water from Meung to Beaugency the necessary siege train,\r\nladders, pickaxes, mattocks, and those great pent-houses beneath which\r\nthe besiegers protected themselves like tortoises under their shells.\r\nThey had sent also cannons and mortars. The gay gunner, Master Jean de\r\nMontesclere, was there.[1261] All these supplies were addressed to the\r\nMaid. The magistrate, Jean Boilleve, brought bread and wine in a\r\nbarge.[1262] Throughout Friday, the 7th, mortars and cannon hurled\r\nstones on the besieged. At the same time from the valley and from the\r\nriver the attack was being made from barges. On the 17th of June, at\r\nmidnight, Sir Richard Gethyn, Bailie of Evreux, who commanded the\r\ngarrison, offered to capitulate. It was agreed that the English should\r\nsurrender the castle and bridge, and depart on the morrow, taking with\r\nthem horses and harness with each man his property to the value of not\r\nmore than one silver mark. Further, they were required to swear that\r\nthey would not take up arms again before the expiration of ten days.\r\nOn these terms, the next day, at sunrise, to the number of five\r\nhundred, they crossed the drawbridge and retreated on Meung, where the\r\ncastle, but not the bridge, remained in the hands of the\r\nEnglish.[1263] The Constable wisely sent a few men to reinforce the\r\ngarrison on the Meung Bridge.[1264] Sir Richard Gethyn and Captain\r\nMatthew Gough were detained as hostages.[1265]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1261: _Journal du siege_, p. 97. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1262: A. de Villaret, _Campagne des Anglais_, pp. 87-88, and\r\nproofs and illustrations, pp. 153, 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1263: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 305. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 102.

They are over there, full\r\none thousand fighting men.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne heard him speak but did not seize his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"What is that man-at-arms saying?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nAnd when she knew, turning to Arthur of Brittany, who was close by,\r\nshe said: \"Ah! Fair Constable, it was not my will that you should\r\ncome, but since you are here, I bid you welcome.\"[1266]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1266: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 98.]\r\n\r\nThe force the French had to face was Sir John Talbot and Sir John\r\nFastolf with the whole English army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF PATAY--OPINIONS OF ITALIAN AND GERMAN ECCLESIASTICS--THE\r\nGIEN ARMY\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving left Paris on the 9th of June, Sir John Fastolf was coming\r\nthrough La Beauce with five thousand fighting men. To the English at\r\nJargeau he was bringing victuals and arrows in abundance. Learning by\r\nthe way that the town had surrendered, he left his stores at Etampes\r\nand marched on to Janville, where Sir John Talbot joined him with\r\nforty lances and two hundred bowmen.[1267]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1267: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, ed.\r\nDupont, vol. i, p. 281.

Sir John Talbot wished to march to the relief of\r\nthe inhabitants of Beaugency and deliver them with the aid of God and\r\nSaint George. Sir John Fastolf counselled abandoning Sir Richard\r\nGethyn and his garrison to their fate; for the moment he deemed it\r\nwiser not to fight. Finding his own men fearful and the French full of\r\ncourage, he thought the best thing the English could do would be to\r\nestablish themselves in the towns, castles, and strongholds remaining\r\nto them, there to await the reinforcements promised by the Regent.\r\n\r\n\"In comparison with the French we are but a handfull,\" he said. \"If\r\nluck should turn against us, then we should be in a fair way to lose\r\nall those conquests won by our late King Henry after strenuous effort\r\nand long delay.\"[1268]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1268: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 331. Wavrin du Forestel,\r\n_Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, pp. 283 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nHis advice was disregarded and the army marched on Beaugency. The\r\nforce was not far from the town on Friday, the 17th of June, just when\r\nthe garrison was issuing forth with horses, armour, and baggage to the\r\namount of one silver mark's worth for each man.[1269]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1269: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, J.

(French\r\ntranslation by S. Luce, in _La revue bleue_, February 13, 1892, pp.\r\n201-204.)]\r\n\r\nInformed of the army's approach the French King's men went forth to\r\nmeet it. The scouts had not far to ride before they descried the\r\nstandards and pennons of England waving over the plain, about two and\r\na half miles from Patay. Then the French ascended a hill whence they\r\ncould observe the enemy. Captain La Hire and the young Sire de Termes\r\nsaid to the Maid: \"The English are coming. They are in battle array\r\nand ready to fight.\"\r\n\r\nAs was her wont, she made answer: \"Strike boldly and they will flee.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she added that the battle would not be long.[1270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1270: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 120. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p.\r\n328. The clerk who wrote down Thibault de Termes' evidence, being\r\nill-informed, described these words as having been uttered at the\r\nBattle of Patay. At Patay, Jeanne and La Hire were not near each\r\nother.]\r\n\r\nBelieving that the French were offering them battle, the English took\r\nup their position. The archers planted their stakes in the ground,\r\ntheir points inclined towards the enemy. Thus they generally prepared\r\nto fight; they had not done otherwise at the Battle of the Herrings.\r\nThe sun was already declining on the horizon.[1271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1271: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p.\r\n286.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alencon had by no means decided to descend into the plain.\r\nIn presence of the Constable, my Lord the Bastard and the captains, he\r\nconsulted the holy Maid, who gave him an enigmatical answer: \"See to\r\nit that you have good spurs.\"\r\n\r\nTaking her to mean the Count of Clermont's spurs, the spurs of\r\nRouvray, the Duke of Alencon exclaimed: \"What do you say? Shall we\r\nturn our backs on them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nOn all occasions her Voices counselled unwavering confidence. \"Nay. In\r\nGod's name, go down against them; for they shall flee and shall not\r\nstay and shall be utterly discomfited; and you shall lose scarce any\r\nmen; wherefore you will need your spurs to pursue them.\"[1272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1272: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 11. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 307. It is clear that this passage from Dunois' evidence and from\r\n_La chronique de la Pucelle_ cannot refer to the battle of June 18th,\r\nas has been thought. \"All the English divisions,\" says Dunois, \"united\r\ninto one army. We thought they were going to offer us battle.\" He is\r\nevidently referring to what happened on the 17th of June. The Duke of\r\nAlencon's evidence confuses everything. How could the Maid have said\r\nof the English: \"God sends them against us,\" when they were fleeing?]\r\n\r\nAccording to the opinions of doctors and masters it was well to listen\r\nto the Maid, but at the same time to follow the course marked out by\r\nhuman wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe commanders of the army, either because they judged the occasion\r\nunfavourable or because, after so many defeats, they feared a pitched\r\nbattle, did not come down from their hill. The two heralds sent by two\r\nEnglish knights to offer single combat received the answer: \"For\r\nto-day you may go to bed, because it grows late. But to-morrow, if it\r\nbe God's will, we will come to closer quarters.\"[1273]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1273: Those who would attribute this saying to the Maid have\r\nmisunderstood Wavrin. _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p. 287.]\r\n\r\nThe English, assured that they would not be attacked, marched off to\r\npass the night at Meung.[1274]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1274: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p.\r\n287. Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 326 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Saturday, the 18th, Saint Hubert's day, the French went\r\nforth against them. They were not there. The _Godons_ had decamped\r\nearly in the morning and gone off, with cannon, ammunition, and\r\nvictuals, towards Janville,[1275] where they intended to entrench\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1275: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, _Journal du siege_, Gruel,\r\nJ. Chartier, Berry, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nStraightway King Charles's army of twelve thousand men[1276] set out\r\nin pursuit of them. Along the Paris road they went, over the plain of\r\nBeauce, wooded, full of game, covered with thickets and brushwood,\r\nwild, but finely to the taste of English and French riders, who\r\npraised it highly.[1277]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1276: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p.\r\n289.

The\r\nmost skilled men-of-war, and among them my Lord the Bastard and the\r\nMarshal de Boussac, mounted on the finest of war-steeds, formed the\r\nvanguard. Then under the leadership of Captain La Hire, who knew the\r\ncountry, came the horse of the Duke of Alencon, the Count of Vendome,\r\nthe Constable of France, with archers and cross-bowmen. Last of all\r\ncame the rear-guard, commanded by the lords of Graville, Laval, Rais,\r\nand Saint-Gilles.[1280]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1280: _Ibid._, p. 71 (evidence of Louis de Coutes).

Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes\r\nchroniques_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid, ever zealous, desired to be in the vanguard; but she was\r\nkept back. She did not lead the men-at-arms, rather the men-at-arms\r\nled her. They regarded her, not as captain of war but as a bringer of\r\ngood luck. Greatly saddened, she must needs take her place in the\r\nrear, in the company, doubtless, of the Sire de Rais, where she had\r\noriginally been placed.[1281] The whole army pressed forward for fear\r\nthe enemy should escape them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1281: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 71. _Journal du siege_, p. 140.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 307. _Deux documents sur Jeanne d'Arc_\r\nin _La revue bleue_, February 13, 1892.]\r\n\r\nAfter they had ridden twelve or thirteen miles in overpowering heat,\r\nand passed Saint-Sigismond on the left and got beyond Saint-Peravy,\r\nCaptain Poton's sixty to eighty scouts reached a spot where the\r\nground, which had been level hitherto, descends, and where the road\r\nleads down into a hollow called La Retreve. They could not actually\r\nsee the hollow, but beyond it the ground rose gently; and, dimly\r\nvisible, scarcely two and a half miles away was the belfry of\r\nLignerolles on the wooded plain known as Climat-du-Camp. A league\r\nstraight in front of them was the little town of Patay.[1282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1282: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 11, 71, 98. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, pp. 306 _et seq._ _Journal du siege_, pp. 103 _et seq._ Jean\r\nChartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 85. Le Comte de Vassal, _La bataille\r\nde Patay_, Orleans, 1890.]\r\n\r\nIt is two o'clock in the afternoon. Poton's and Gugem's horse chance\r\nto raise a stag, which darts out of a thicket and plunges down into\r\nthe hollow of La Retreve. Suddenly a clamour of voices ascends from\r\nthe hollow. It proceeds from the English soldiers loudly disputing\r\nover the game which has fallen into their hands. Thus informed of the\r\nenemy's presence, the French scouts halt and straightway despatch\r\ncertain of their company to go and tell the army that they have\r\nsurprised the _Godons_ and that it is time to set to work.[1283]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1283: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 328.]\r\n\r\nNow this is what had been happening among the English. They were\r\nretreating in good order on Janville, their vanguard commanded by a\r\nknight bearing a white standard.[1284] Then came the artillery and the\r\nvictuals in waggons driven by merchants; then the main body of the\r\narmy, commanded by Sir John Talbot and Sir John Fastolf. The\r\nrear-guard, which was likely to bear the brunt of the attack,\r\nconsisted only of Englishmen from England.[1285] It followed at some\r\ndistance from the rest. Its scouts, having seen the French without\r\nbeing seen by them, informed Sir John Talbot, who was then between the\r\nhamlet of Saint-Peravy and the town of Patay. On this information he\r\ncalled a halt and commanded the vanguard with waggons and cannon to\r\ntake up its position on the edge of the Lignerolles wood. The position\r\nwas excellent: backed by the forest, the combatants were secure\r\nagainst being attacked in the rear,[1286] while in front they were\r\nable to entrench themselves behind their waggons. The main body did\r\nnot advance so far. It halted some little distance from Lignerolles,\r\nin the hollow of La Retreve. On this spot the road was lined with\r\nquickset hedges. Sir John Talbot with five hundred picked bowmen\r\nstationed himself there to await the French who must perforce pass\r\nthat way. His design was to defend the road until the rear-guard had\r\nhad time to join the main body, and then, keeping close to the hedges,\r\nhe would fall back upon the army.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1284: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p.\r\n291.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1285: _Ibid._, pp. 291-292.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1286: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 329.]\r\n\r\nThe archers, as was their wont, were making ready to plant in the\r\nground those pointed stakes, the spikes of which they turned against\r\nthe chests of the enemy's horses, when the French, led by Poton's\r\nscouts, came down upon them like a whirlwind, overthrew them, and cut\r\nthem to pieces.[1287]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1287: Wavrin du Forestel, _Anciennes chroniques_, vol. i, p.\r\n292. Monstrelet, vol. iii, pp. 329, 350.]\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Sir John Fastolf, at the head of the main body, was\r\npreparing to join the vanguard. Feeling the French cavalry at his\r\nheels, he gave spur and at full gallop led his men on to Lignerolles.\r\nWhen those of the white standard saw him arriving thus in rout, they\r\nthought he had been defeated. They took fright, abandoned the edge of\r\nthe wood, rushed into the thickets of Climat-du-Camp and in great\r\ndisorder came out on the Paris road. With the main body of the army,\r\nSir John Fastolf pushed on in the same direction. There was no battle.\r\nMarching over the bodies of Talbot's archers, the French threw\r\nthemselves on the English, who were as dazed as a flock of sheep and\r\nfell before the foe without resistance. Thus the French slew two\r\nthousand of those common folk whom the _Godons_ were accustomed to\r\ntransport from their own land to be killed in France. When the main\r\nbody of the French, commanded by La Hire, reached Lignerolles, they\r\nfound only eight hundred foot whom they soon overthrew. Of the twelve\r\nto thirteen thousand French on the march, scarce fifteen hundred took\r\npart in the battle or rather in the massacre. Sir John Talbot, who had\r\nleapt on to his horse without staying to put on his spurs, was taken\r\nprisoner by the Captains La Hire and Poton.[1288] The Lords Scales,\r\nHungerford and Falconbridge, Sir Thomas Guerard, Richard Spencer and\r\nFitz Walter were taken and held to ransom. In all, there were between\r\ntwelve and fifteen hundred prisoners.[1289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1288: \"In the neighbourhood of Lignerolles there have been\r\nfound horse-shoes, a javelin-point, the iron pieces of carts, and\r\nbullets.\" P.

Except for the vanguard, which had been the first\r\nto take flight, the English army was entirely destroyed. On the French\r\nside, the Sire de Termes, who was present, states that there was only\r\none killed; a man of his own company. Perceval de Boulainvilliers,\r\nCouncillor and King's Chamberlain, says there were three.[1290]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1290: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 120; vol. v, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid arrived[1291] before the slaughter was ended.[1292] She saw a\r\nFrenchman, who was leading some prisoners, strike one of them such a\r\nblow on the head that he fell down as if dead. She dismounted and\r\nprocured the Englishman a confessor. She held his head and comforted\r\nhim as far as she could. Such was the part she played in the Battle of\r\nPatay.[1293] It was the part of a saintly maid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1291: \"Et habuit _l'avant garde La Hire_ de quo ipsa Johanna\r\nfuit multum irata, quia ipsa multum affectabat habere onus de _l'avant\r\ngarde_ La Hire qui conducebat _l'avant garde_ percussit super\r\nAnglicos,\" _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 71 (evidence of Louis de Coutes).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1292: \"Habebat magnam pietatem de tanta occisione,\" _Trial_,\r\nvol. iii, p. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1293: After an examination of the documents I have concluded\r\nthat Louis de Coutes' narrative refers to Patay.]\r\n\r\nThe French spent the night in the town. Sir John Talbot, having been\r\nbrought before the Duke of Alencon and the Constable, was thus\r\naddressed by the young Duke: \"This morning you little thought what\r\nwould happen to you.\"\r\n\r\nTalbot replied: \"It is the chance of war.\"[1294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1294: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nA few breathless _Godons_ succeeded in reaching Janville.[1295] But\r\nthe townsfolk, with whom on their departure they had deposited their\r\nmoney and their goods, shut the gates in their faces and swore loyalty\r\nto King Charles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1295: Boucher de Molandon, _Janville, son donjon, son\r\nchateau, ses souvenirs du XV'e siecle_, Orleans, 1886, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe English commanders of the two small strongholds in La Beauce,\r\nMontpipeau and Saint Sigismond, set fire to them and fled.[1296]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1296: _Journal du siege_, p. 105; _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\npp. 307, 308.]\r\n\r\nFrom Patay the victorious army marched to Orleans. The inhabitants\r\nwere expecting the King. They had hung up tapestries ready for his\r\nentrance.[1297] But the King and his Chamberlain, fearing and not\r\nwithout reason, some aggressive movement on the part of the Constable,\r\nheld themselves secure in the Chateau of Sully.[1298] Thence they\r\nstarted for Chateauneuf on the 22nd of June. That same day the Maid\r\njoined the King at Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire. He received her with his\r\nusual kindness and said: \"I pity you because of the suffering you\r\nendure.\" And he urged her to rest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1297: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 307-308. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1298: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p.\r\n222 _et seq._; E. Cosneau, _Le connetable de Richemont_, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nAt these words she wept. It has been said that her tears flowed\r\nbecause of the indifference and incredulity towards her that the\r\nKing's urbanity implied.[1299] But we must beware of attributing to\r\nthe tears of the enraptured and the illuminated a cause intelligible\r\nto human reason. To her Charles appeared clothed in an ineffable\r\nsplendour like that of the holiest of kings. How, since she had shown\r\nhim her angels, invisible to ordinary folk, could she for one moment\r\nhave thought that he lacked faith in her?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1299: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 116 (evidence of S. Charles).\r\n\"_Et audivit ipse loquens ex ore regis multa bona de ea ... rex habuit\r\npietatem de ea et de poena quam portabat._\"]\r\n\r\n\"Have no doubt,\" she said to him, confidently, \"you shall receive the\r\nwhole of your kingdom and shortly shall be crowned.\"[1300]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1300: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 76, 116.]\r\n\r\nTrue, Charles seemed in no great haste to employ his knights in the\r\nrecovery of his kingdom. But his Council just then had no idea of\r\ngetting rid of the Maid. On the contrary, they were determined to use\r\nher cleverly, so as to put heart into the French, to terrify the\r\nEnglish, and to convince the world that God, Saint Michael, and Saint\r\nCatherine, were on the side of the Armagnacs. In announcing the\r\nvictory of Patay to the good towns, the royal councillors said not one\r\nword of the Constable, neither did they mention my Lord the\r\nBastard.[1301] They described as leaders of the army, the Maid, with\r\nthe two Princes of the Blood Royal, the Duke of Alencon, and the Duke\r\nof Vendome. In such wise did they exalt her. And, indeed, she must\r\nhave been worth as much and more than a great captain, since the\r\nConstable attempted to seize her. With this enterprise, he charged one\r\nof his men, Andrieu de Beaumont, who had formerly been employed to\r\ncarry off the Sire de la Tremouille. But, as Andrieu de Beaumont had\r\nfailed with the Chamberlain, so he failed with the Maid.[1302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1301: Letter from Charles VII to the people of Dauphine,\r\npublished by Fauche-Prunelle, in _Bull. de l'Acad.

Cosneau, _Le connetable de\r\nRichemont_, pp. 181, 182.]\r\n\r\nProbably she herself knew nothing of this plot. She besought the King\r\nto pardon the Constable,--a request which proves how great was her\r\nnaivete. By royal command Richemont received back his lordship of\r\nParthenay.[1303]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1303: 1431, 8th of May.

In 1420,\r\nconsidering him too Burgundian, they had devised for him a Bridge of\r\nMontereau.[1304] In reality, he was neither Armagnac nor Burgundian\r\nnor French nor English, but Breton. In 1423 he recognised the Treaty\r\nof Troyes; but two years later, when his brother, the Duke of\r\nRichemont, had gone over to the French King and received the\r\nConstable's sword from him, Duke John went to Charles of Valois, at\r\nSaumur, and did homage for his duchy.[1305] In short, he extricated\r\nhimself cleverly from the most embarrassing situations and succeeded\r\nin remaining outside the quarrel of the two kings who were both eager\r\nto involve him in it. While France and England were cutting each\r\nother's throats, he was raising Brittany from its ruins.[1306]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1304: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 30; De Beaucourt, _Histoire de\r\nCharles VII_, vol. i, pp. 202 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1305: Dom Morice, _Histoire de Bretagne_, vol. ii, col.\r\n1135-6; De Beaucourt, _loc. cit._, vol. ii, chap. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1306: Bellier-Dumaine, _L'administration du duche de\r\nBretagne sous le regne de Jean V_ (1399-1442) in _Les annales de\r\nBretagne_, vol. xiv-xvi (1898-99) _passim_, and 3rd part, Jean V and\r\ncommerce, industry, agriculture, public education (vol. xvi, p. 246),\r\nand 4th part, chap. iii, Jean V and towns, rural parishes (vol. xvi,\r\np. 495).]\r\n\r\nThe Maid filled him with curiosity and admiration. Shortly after the\r\nBattle of Patay, he sent to her, Hermine, his herald-at-arms, and\r\nBrother Yves Milbeau, his confessor, to congratulate her on her\r\nvictory.[1307] The good Brother was told to question Jeanne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1307: Eberhard Windecke, p. 179.]\r\n\r\nHe asked her whether it was God who had sent her to succour the King.\r\n\r\nJeanne replied that it was.\r\n\r\n\"If it be so,\" replied Brother Yves Milbeau, \"my Lord the Duke of\r\nBrittany, our liege lord, is disposed to proffer his service to the\r\nKing. He cannot come in person for he is sorely infirm. But he is to\r\nsend his son with a large army.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Brother was speaking lightly and making a promise for his\r\nduke which would never be kept. The only truth in it was that many\r\nBreton nobles were coming in to take service with King Charles.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, the little Saint made a curious mistake. She\r\nthought that Brother Yves had meant that the Duke of Brittany was her\r\nliege lord as well as his, which would have been altogether senseless.\r\nHer loyalty revolted: \"The Duke of Brittany is not my liege lord,\" she\r\nreplied sharply. \"The King is my liege lord.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as we can tell, the Duke of Brittany's caution had produced no\r\nfavourable impression in France. He was censured for having set the\r\nKing's war ban at nought and made a treaty with the English. Jeanne\r\nwas of that opinion and to Brother Yves she said so plainly: \"The Duke\r\nshould not have tarried so long in sending his men to aid the\r\nKing.\"[1308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1308: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 178, 179.]\r\n\r\nA few days later, the Sire de Rostrenen, who had accompanied the\r\nConstable to Beaugency and to Patay, came from Duke John to treat of\r\nthe prospective marriage between his eldest son, Francois, and Bonne\r\nde Savoie, daughter of Duke Amedee. With him was Comment-Qu'il-Soit,\r\nherald of Richard of Brittany, Count of Etampes. The herald was\r\ncommissioned to present the Maid with a dagger and horses.[1309]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1309: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 264. Eberhard Windecke, pp. 68-70,\r\n179. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 90. Dom Lobineau, _Histoire de Bretagne_,\r\nvol. i, p. 587. Dom Morice, _Histoire de Bretagne_, vol. i, pp. 508,\r\n580.]\r\n\r\nAt Rome, in 1428, there was a French clerk, a compiler of one of those\r\nhistories of the world so common in those days and so much alike. His\r\ncosmography, like all of them, began with the creation and came down\r\nto the pontificate of Martin V who was then Pope. \"Under this\r\npontificate,\" wrote the author, \"the realm of France, the flower and\r\nthe lily of the world, opulent among the most opulent, before whom the\r\nwhole universe bowed, was cast down by its invader, the tyrant Henry,\r\nwho was not even the lawful lord of the realm of England.\" Then this\r\nchurchman vows the Burgundians to eternal infamy and hurls upon them\r\nthe most terrible maledictions. \"May their eyes be torn out: may they\r\nperish by an evil death!\" Such language indicates a good Armagnac and\r\npossibly a clerk despoiled of his goods and driven into exile by the\r\nenemies of his country. When he learns the coming of the Maid and the\r\ndeliverance of Orleans, transported with joy and wonder, he re-opens\r\nhis history and consigns to its pages arguments in favour of the\r\nmarvellous Maid, whose deeds appear to him more divine than human, but\r\nconcerning whom he knows but little. He compares her to Deborah,\r\nJudith, Esther, and Penthesilea. \"In the books of the Gentiles it is\r\nwritten,\" he says, \"that Penthesilea, and a thousand virgins with her,\r\ncame to the succour of King Priam and fought so valiantly that they\r\ntore the Myrmidons in pieces and slew more than two thousand Greeks.\"\r\nAccording to him, both in courage and feats of prowess, the Maid far\r\nsurpasses Penthesilea. Her deeds promptly refute those who maintain\r\nthat she is sent by the Devil.[1310]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1310: L. Delisle, _Un nouveau temoignage relatif a la\r\nmission de Jeanne d'Arc_ in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_,\r\nvol. xlvi, pp. 649, 668. Le P. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant l'Eglise de\r\nson temps_, pp. 53, 60.]\r\n\r\nIn a moment the fame of the French King's prophetess had been spread\r\nabroad throughout Christendom. While in temporal affairs the people\r\nwere rending each other, in spiritual matters obedience to one common\r\nhead made Europe one spiritual republic with one language and one\r\ndoctrine, governed by councils. The spirit of the Church was\r\nall-pervading. In Italy, in Germany, the talk was all of the Sibyl of\r\nFrance and her prowess which was so intimately associated with the\r\nChristian faith. In those days it was sometimes the custom of those\r\nwho painted on the walls of monasteries to depict the Liberal Arts as\r\nthree noble dames. Between her two sisters, Logic would be painted,\r\nseated on a lofty throne, wearing an antique turban, clothed in a\r\nsparkling robe, and bearing in one hand a scorpion, in the other a\r\nlizard, as a sign that her knowledge winds its way into the heart of\r\nthe adversary's argument, and saves her from being herself entrapped.\r\nAt her feet, looking up to her, would be Aristotle, disputing and\r\nreckoning up his arguments on his fingers.[1311] This austere lady\r\nformed all her disciples in the same mould. In those days nothing was\r\nmore despicable than singularity. Originality of mind did not then\r\nexist. The clerks who treated of the Maid all followed the same\r\nmethod, advanced the same arguments, and based them on the same texts,\r\nsacred and profane. Conformity could go no further. Their minds were\r\nidentical, but not their hearts; it is the mind that argues, but the\r\nheart that decides. These scholastics, dryer than their parchment,\r\nwere men, notwithstanding; they were swayed by sentiment, by passion,\r\nby interests spiritual or temporal. While the Armagnac doctors were\r\ndemonstrating that in the Maid's case reasons for belief were stronger\r\nthan reasons for disbelief, the German or Italian masters, caring\r\nnought for the quarrel of the Dauphin of Viennois,[1312] remained in\r\ndoubt, unmoved by either love or hatred.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1311: Cathedrale du Puy.

Male, _Les Arts\r\nliberaux dans la statuaire du moyen age_, in _Revue archeologique_,\r\n1891.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1312: Another name for Dauphine (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nThere was a doctor of theology, one Heinrich von Gorcum, a professor\r\nat Cologne. As early as the month of June, 1429, he drew up a memorial\r\nconcerning the Maid. In Germany, minds were divided as to whether the\r\nnature of the damsel were human or whether she were not rather a\r\ncelestial being clothed in woman's form; as to whether her deeds\r\nproceeded from a human origin or had a supernatural source; and, if\r\nthe latter, whether that source were good or bad. Meister Heinrich von\r\nGorcum wrote his treatise to present arguments from Holy Scripture on\r\nboth sides, and he abstained from drawing any conclusion.[1313]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1313: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 411-421. Le P. Ayroles, _La\r\nPucelle devant l'Eglise de son temps_, vol. i, pp. 61-68.]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the same doubts and the same uncertainty prevailed\r\nconcerning the deeds of the Maid. Those there were who maintained that\r\nthey were mere inventions. At Milan, it was disputed whether any\r\ncredence could be placed in tidings from France. To discover the truth\r\nabout them, the notables of the city resolved to despatch a Franciscan\r\nfriar, Brother Antonio de Rho, a good humanist and a zealous preacher\r\nof moral purity.\r\n\r\nAnd Giovanni Corsini, Senator of the duchy of Arezzo, impelled by a\r\nlike curiosity, consulted a learned clerk of Milan, one Cosmo Raimondi\r\nof Cremona. The following is the gist of the learned Ciceronian's\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n\"Most noble lord, they say that God's choice of a shepherdess for the\r\nrestoration of a kingdom to a prince, is a new thing. And yet we know\r\nthat the shepherd David was anointed king. It is told how the Maid, at\r\nthe head of a small company, defied a great army. The victory may be\r\nexplained by an advantageous position and an unexpected attack. But\r\nsupposing we refrain from saying that the enemy was surprised and that\r\nhis courage forsook him, matters which are none the less possible,\r\nsupposing we admit that there was a miracle: what is there astonishing\r\nin that? Is it not still more wonderful that Samson should have slain\r\nso many Philistines with the jaw-bone of an ass?\r\n\r\n\"The Maid is said to possess the power of revealing the future.\r\nRemember the Sibyls, notably the Erythraean and the Cumaean. They were\r\nheathens. Why should not a like power be granted to a Christian? This\r\nwoman is a shepherdess. Jacob, when he kept Laban's flocks, conversed\r\nfamiliarly with God. To such examples and to such reasons, which\r\nincline me to give credence to the rumour, I add another reason\r\nderived from physical science. In treatises on astrology I have often\r\nread that by the favourable influence of the stars, certain men of\r\nlowly birth have become the equals of the highest princes and been\r\nregarded as men divine charged with a celestial mission. Guido da\r\nForli, a clever astronomer, quotes a great number of such instances.\r\nWherefore I should not deem myself to be incurring any reproach if I\r\nbelieved that through the influence of the stars, the Maid has\r\nundertaken what is reported of her.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his arguments the clerk of Cremona says that,\r\nwhile not absolutely rejecting the reports concerning her, he does not\r\nconsider them to be sufficiently proved.[1314]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1314: Le P. Ayroles, vol. iv, _La vierge guerriere_, pp. 240\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nJeanne maintained her resolution to go to Reims and take the King to\r\nhis anointing.[1315] She did not stay to consider whether it would be\r\nbetter to wage war in Champagne than in Normandy. She did not know\r\nenough of the configuration of the country to decide such a question,\r\nand it is not likely that her saints and angels knew more of geography\r\nthan she did. She was in haste to take the King to Reims for his\r\nanointing, because she believed it impossible for him to be king\r\nuntil he had been anointed.[1316] The idea of leading him to be\r\nanointed with the holy oil had come to her in her native village, long\r\nbefore the siege of Orleans.[1317] This inspiration was wholly of the\r\nspirit, and had nothing to do with the state of affairs created by the\r\ndeliverance of Orleans and the victory of Patay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1315: \"_Sed dicta puella semper fuit opinionis quod\r\nopportebat ire Remis._\" _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 12 (evidence of\r\nDunois).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1316: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 20. _Journal du siege_, pp. 93,\r\n94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1317: See _ante_, pp. 53 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe best course would have been to march straight on Paris after the\r\n18th of June. The French were then only ninety miles from the great\r\ncity, which at that juncture would not have thought of defending\r\nitself. Considering it as good as lost, the Regent shut himself up in\r\nthe Fort of Vincennes.[1318] They had missed their opportunity. The\r\nFrench King's Councillors, Princes of the Blood, were deliberating,\r\nsurprised by victory, not knowing what to do with it. Certain it is\r\nthat not one of them thought of conquering, and that speedily, the\r\nwhole inheritance of King Charles. The forces at their disposal, and\r\nthe very conditions of the society in which they lived, rendered it\r\nimpossible for them to conceive of such an undertaking. The lords of\r\nthe Great Council were not like the poverty stricken monks, dreaming\r\nin their ruined cloisters[1319] of an age of peace and concord. The\r\nKing's Councillors were no dreamers; they did not believe in the end\r\nof the war, neither did they desire it. But they intended to conduct\r\nit with the least possible risk and expenditure. There would always be\r\nfolk enough to don the hauberk and go a-plundering they said to\r\nthemselves; the taking and re-taking of towns must continue;\r\nsufficient unto the day is the evil thereof; to fight long one must\r\nfight gently; nine times out of ten more is gained by negotiations and\r\ntreaties than by feats of prowess; truces must be concluded craftily\r\nand broken cautiously; some defeats must be expected, and some work\r\nmust be left for the young. Such were the opinions of the good\r\nservants of King Charles.[1320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1318: Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 451. _Journal\r\nd'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 239. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 291.\r\nDe Barante, _Histoire des ducs de Bourgogne_, vol. iii, p. 323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1319: Le P. Denifle, _La desolation des eglises_,\r\nintroduction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1320: Those of Louis XI were of a like mind: \"One should\r\nfear risking a great battle if one be not constrained to it.\" Philippe\r\nde Comynes, ed. Mdlle. Dupont, vol. i, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nCertain among them wished the war to be carried on in Normandy.[1321]\r\nThe idea had occurred to them as early as the month of May, before the\r\nLoire campaign, and indeed there was much to be said for it. In\r\nNormandy they would cut the English tree at its root. It was quite\r\npossible that they might immediately recover a part of that province\r\nwhere the English had but few fighting men. In 1424 the Norman\r\ngarrisons consisted of not more than four hundred lances and twelve\r\nhundred bowmen.[1322] Since then they had received but few\r\nreinforcements. The Regent was recruiting men everywhere and\r\ndisplaying marvellous activity, but he lacked money, and his soldiers\r\nwere always deserting.[1323] In the conquered province, as soon as the\r\n_Coues_ came out of their strongholds they found themselves in the\r\nenemy's territory. From the borders of Brittany, Maine, Perche as far\r\nas Ponthieu and Picardy, on the banks of the Mayenne, Orne, the Dive,\r\nthe Touque, the Eure, the Seine, the partisans of the various factions\r\nheld the country, watching the roads, robbing, ravaging, and\r\nmurdering.[1324] Everywhere the French would have found these brave\r\nfellows ready to espouse their cause; the peasants and the village\r\npriests would likewise have wished them well. But the campaign would\r\ninvolve long sieges of towns, strongly defended, albeit held by but\r\nsmall garrisons. Now the men-at-arms dreaded the delays of sieges, and\r\nthe royal treasury was not sufficient for such costly undertakings.[1325]\r\nNormandy was ruined, stripped of its crops, and robbed of its cattle.\r\nWere the captains and their men to go into this famine-stricken land?\r\nAnd why should the King reconquer so poor a province?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1321: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 12, 13. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 300.

It was well known that brigands they\r\nwere, and brigands would remain, and that Normandy once reconquered,\r\nthey would have to be got rid of, to the last man, without honour and\r\nwithout profit. In which case would it not be better to leave them to\r\nbe dealt with by the _Godons_?\r\n\r\nOther nobles clamoured for an expedition into Champagne.[1326] And in\r\nspite of all that has been said to the contrary, the Maid's visions\r\nhad no influence whatever on this determination. The King's\r\nCouncillors led Jeanne and were far from being led by her. Once\r\nbefore they had diverted her from the road to Reims by providing her\r\nwith work on the Loire. Once again they might divert her into\r\nNormandy, without her even perceiving it, so ignorant was she of the\r\nroads and of the lie of the land. If there were certain who\r\nrecommended a campaign in Champagne, it was not on the faith of saints\r\nand angels, but for purely human reasons. Is it possible to discover\r\nthese reasons? There were doubtless certain lords and captains who\r\nconsidered the interest of the King and the kingdom, but every one\r\nfound it so difficult not to confound it with his own interest, that\r\nthe best way to discover who was responsible for the march on Reims is\r\nto find out who was to profit by it. It was certainly not the Duke of\r\nAlencon, who would have greatly preferred to take advantage of the\r\nMaid's help for the conquest of his own duchy.[1327] Neither was it my\r\nLord the Bastard, nor the Sire de Gaucourt, nor the King himself, for\r\nthey must have desired the securing of Berry and the Orleanais by the\r\ncapture of La Charite held by the terrible Perrinet Gressart.[1328] On\r\nthe other hand we may conclude that the Queen of Sicily would not be\r\nunfavourable to the march of the King, her son-in-law, in a north\r\neasterly direction. This Spanish lady was possessed by the Angevin\r\nmania. Reassured for the moment concerning the fate of her duchy of\r\nAnjou, she was pursuing eagerly, and to the great hurt of the realm of\r\nFrance, the establishment of her son Rene in the duchy of Bar and in\r\nthe inheritance of Lorraine. She cannot have been displeased,\r\ntherefore, when she saw the King keeping her an open road between Gien\r\nand Troyes and Chalons. But since the Constable's exile she had lost\r\nall influence over her son-in-law, and it is difficult to discover who\r\ncould have watched her interests in the Council of May, 1429.[1329]\r\nBesides, without seeking further, it is obvious that there was one\r\nperson, who above all others must have desired the anointing of the\r\nKing, and who more than any was in a position to make his opinion\r\nprevail. That person was the man on whom devolved the duty of holding\r\nin his consecrated hands the Sacred Ampulla, my Lord Regnault de\r\nChartres, Archbishop Duke of Reims, Chancellor of the Kingdom.[1330]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1326: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1327: Perceval de Cagny, p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1328: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1329: E. Cosneau, _Le connetable de Richemont_, pp. 179 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1330: Even after the coronation Regnault de Chartres would\r\nnot \"suffer the Maid and the Duke of Alencon to be together nor that\r\nhe should recover her.\" Perceval de Cagny, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nHe was a man of rare intelligence, skilled in business, a very clever\r\ndiplomatist, greedy of wealth, caring less for empty honours than for\r\nsolid advantage, avaricious, unscrupulous, one who at the age of about\r\nfifty had lost nothing of his consuming energy; he had recently\r\ndisplayed it by spending himself nobly in the defence of Orleans. Thus\r\ngifted, how could he fail to exercise a powerful control over the\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nFifteen years had passed since his elevation to the archiepiscopal see\r\nof Reims; and of his enormous revenue he had not yet received one\r\npenny. Albeit the possessor of great wealth from other sources, he\r\npleaded poverty. To the Pope he addressed heart-rending\r\nsupplications.[1331] If the Maid had found favour in the eyes of the\r\nPoitiers doctors, Monseigneur Regnault had had something to do with\r\nit. Had it not been for him, the doctors at court would never have\r\nproposed her examination. And we shall not be making too bold a\r\nhypothesis if we conclude, that when the march on Reims was decided in\r\nthe royal council, it was because the Archbishop, on grounds suggested\r\nby human reason, approved of what the Maid proposed by divine\r\ninspiration.[1332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1331: Le P. Denifle, _La desolation des eglises_,\r\nintroduction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1332: See _ante_, pp. 153-159.]\r\n\r\nWhile the coronation campaign was attended with grave drawbacks and\r\nmet with serious obstacles, it nevertheless brought great gain and a\r\ncertain subtle advantage to the royal cause. Unfortunately it left\r\nfree from attack the rest of France occupied by the English, and it\r\ngave the latter time to recover themselves and procure aid from over\r\nsea. We shall shortly see what good use they made of their\r\nopportunities.[1333] As to the advantages of the expedition, they were\r\nmany and various. First, Jeanne truly expressed the sentiments of the\r\npoor priests and the common folk when she said that the Dauphin would\r\nreap great profit from his anointing.[1334] From the oil of the holy\r\nAmpulla the King would derive a splendour, a majesty which would\r\nimpress the whole of France, yea, even the whole of Christendom. In\r\nthose days royalty was alike spiritual and temporal; and multitudes of\r\nmen believed with Jeanne that kings only became kings by being\r\nanointed with the holy oil. Thus it would not be wrong to say that\r\nCharles of Valois would receive greater power from one drop of oil\r\nthan from ten thousand lances. On a consideration like this the King's\r\nCouncillors must needs set great store. They had also to take into\r\naccount the time and the place. Might not the ceremony be performed in\r\nsome other town than Reims? Might not the so-called \"mystery\" take\r\nplace in that city which had been delivered by the intercession of its\r\nblessed patrons, Saint-Aignan and Saint Euverte? Two kings descended\r\nfrom Hugh Capet, Robert the Wise and Louis the Fat, had been crowned\r\nat Orleans.[1335] But the memory of their royal coronation was lost in\r\nthe mists of antiquity, while folk still retained the memory of a long\r\nprocession of most Christian kings anointed in the town where the holy\r\noil had been brought down to Clovis by the celestial dove.[1336]\r\nBesides, the lord Archbishop and Duke of Reims would never have\r\nsuffered the King to receive his anointing save at his hand and in his\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1333: Morosini, vol. iv, supplement, xvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1334: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 20, 300. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, pp. 322, 323. _Journal du siege_, pp. 93, 114. \"And although\r\nthe King had not money wherewith to pay his army, all knights,\r\nsquires, men-at-arms, and the commonalty refused not to serve the King\r\nin this journey in company with the Maid.\" Perceval de Cagny, p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1335: Le Maire, _Antiquites d'Orleans_, ch. xxv, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1336: Pius II, _Commentarii_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp.\r\n513-514. Pierre des Gros, _Jardin des nobles_ in P. Paris, _Manuscrits\r\nfrancais de la bibliotheque du roi_, vol. ii, p. 149, and _Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, pp. 533, 534.]\r\n\r\nTherefore it was necessary to go to Reims. It was necessary also to\r\nanticipate the English who had resolved to conduct thither their\r\ninfant King that he might receive consecration according to the\r\nancient ceremonial.[1337] But if the French had invaded Normandy they\r\nwould have closed the young Henry's road to Paris and to Reims, a road\r\nwhich was already insecure for him; and it would be childish to\r\nmaintain that the coronation could not have been postponed for a few\r\nweeks. If the conquest of Norman lands and Norman towns was renounced\r\ntherefore, it was not merely for the sake of capturing the holy\r\nAmpulla. The Lord Archbishop of Reims had other objects at heart. He\r\nbelieved, for example, that, by pressing in between the Duke of\r\nBurgundy and his English allies, an excellent impression would be\r\nproduced on the mind of that Prince and the edifying object-lesson\r\npresented to his consideration of Charles, son of Charles, King of\r\nFrance, riding at the head of a powerful army.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1337: William of Worcester [1415-1482, or Botoner,\r\nchronicler and traveller, secretary to Sir John Fastolf, disputed with\r\nJohn Paston concerning some land near Norwich, and frequently referred\r\nto in the Paston Letters. W.S.] in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 475. In 1430\r\nit was the intention of the English to take their King to Reims \"for\r\nwhich cause all the subjects of the kingdom would be more inclined to\r\nhim\" (advice given by Philippe le Bon to Henry VI, as cited by H. de\r\nLannoy, in P. Champion, _G. de Flavy_, p. 156). There was an English\r\nproject for carrying off the holy Ampulla from Reims. Pius II,\r\n_Commentarii_ in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 513.]\r\n\r\nTo attain the city of the Blessed Saint Remi two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles of hostile country must be traversed. But for some time the army\r\nwould be in no danger of meeting the enemy on the road. The English\r\nand Burgundians were engaged in using every means both fair and foul\r\nfor the raising of troops. For the moment the French need fear no foe.\r\nThe rich country of Champagne, sparsely wooded, well cultivated,\r\nteemed with corn and wine, and abounded in fat cattle.[1338] Champagne\r\nhad not been devastated like Normandy. There was a likelihood of\r\nobtaining food for the men-at-arms, especially if, as was hoped, the\r\ngood towns supplied victuals. They were very wealthy; their barns\r\noverflowed with corn. While owing allegiance to King Henry, no bonds\r\nof affection united them to the English or to the Burgundians. They\r\ngoverned themselves. They were rich merchants, who only longed for\r\npeace and who did their best to bring it about. Just now they were\r\nbeginning to suspect that the Armagnacs were growing the stronger\r\nparty. These folk of Champagne had a clergy and a _bourgeoisie_ who\r\nmight be appealed to. It was not a question of storming their towns\r\nwith artillery, mines, and trenches, but of getting round them with\r\namnesties, concessions to the merchants and elaborate engagements to\r\nrespect the privileges of the clergy. In this country there was no\r\nrisk of rotting in hovels or burning in bastions. The townsfolk were\r\nexpected to throw open their gates and partly from love, partly from\r\nfear, to give money to their lord the King.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1338: _Voyages du heraut Berry_, Bibl. Nat. ms. fr. 5873,\r\nfol. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign was already arranged, and that very skilfully.\r\nCommunications had been opened with Troyes and Chalons. By letters and\r\nmessages from a few notables of Reims it was made known to King\r\nCharles that if he came they would open to him the gates of their\r\ntown. He even received three or four citizens, who said to him, \"Go\r\nforth in confidence to our city of Reims. It shall not be our fault if\r\nyou do not enter therein.\"[1339]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1339: Jean Rogier in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 284-285.]\r\n\r\nSuch assurances emboldened the Royal Council; and the march into\r\nChampagne was resolved upon.\r\n\r\nThe army assembled at Gien; it increased daily. The nobles of Brittany\r\nand Poitou came in in great numbers, most of them mounted on sorry\r\nsteeds[1340] and commanding but small companies of men. The poorest\r\nequipped themselves as archers, and in default of better service were\r\nready to act as bowmen. Villeins and tradesmen came likewise.[1341]\r\nFrom the Loire to the Seine and from the Seine to the Somme the only\r\ncultivated land was round _chateaux_ and fortresses. Most of the\r\nfields lay fallow. In many places fairs and markets had been\r\nsuspended. Labourers were everywhere out of work. War, after having\r\nruined all trades, was now the only trade. Says Eustache Deschamps,\r\n\"All men will become squires. Scarce any artisans are left.\"[1342] At\r\nthe place of meeting there assembled thirty thousand men, of whom many\r\nwere on foot and many came from the villages, giving their services in\r\nreturn for food. There were likewise monks, valets, women and other\r\ncamp-followers. And all this multitude was an hungered. The King went\r\nto Gien and summoned the Queen who was at Bourges.[1343]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1340: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 312.

But queens had not\r\nusually been crowned at Reims; Queen Ysabeau, mother of the present\r\nKing, had received the crown from the hands of the Archbishop of Rouen\r\nin the Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris.[1344] Before her time, the wives of\r\nthe kings, following the example set by Berthe, wife of Pepin the\r\nShort, generally came to Saint-Denys to receive the crown of gold, of\r\nsapphire and of pearls given by Jeanne of Evreux to the monks of the\r\nAbbey.[1345] Sometimes the queens were crowned with their husbands,\r\nsometimes alone and in a different place; many had never been crowned\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1344: S.J. Morand, _Histoire de la Sainte-Chapelle royale du\r\nPalais_, Paris, 1790, in 4to, p. 77, and _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1345: Le P. J.

Nevertheless, at the last moment the plan was changed. The\r\nQueen, who had come to Gien, was sent back to Bourges. The King set\r\nout without her.[1346]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1346: _Journal du siege_, p. 107. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 310.]\r\n\r\n    Quand le roy s'en vint en France,\r\n    Il feit oindre ses houssiaulx,\r\n    Et la royne lui demande:\r\n    Ou veult aller cest damoiseaulx?[1347]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1347: When the King set out in France, he had his gaiters\r\ngreased; and the Queen asked him: whither will wend these damoiseaux?\r\nQuoted according to _La Chronique Messine_ by Vallet de Viriville,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i, p. 424, note 1.]\r\n\r\nIn reality the Queen asked nothing. She was ill-favoured and weak of\r\nwill.[1348] But the song says that the King on his departure had his\r\nold gaiters greased because he had no new ones. Those old jokes about\r\nthe poverty of the King of Bourges still held good.[1349] The King had\r\nnot grown rich. It was customary to pay the men-at-arms a part of\r\ntheir wages in advance. At Gien each fighting man received three\r\nfrancs. It did not seem much, but they hoped to gain more on the\r\nway.[1350]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1348: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iv, p.\r\n88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1349: See _ante_, pp. 148-152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1350: Perceval de Cagny, p. 157. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_,\r\nvol. i, p. 87. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 313.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 24th of June, the Maid set out from Orleans for Gien.\r\nOn the morrow she dictated from Gien a letter to the inhabitants of\r\nTournai, telling them how the English had been driven from all their\r\nstrongholds on the Loire and discomfited in battle. In this letter she\r\ninvited them to come to the anointing of King Charles at Reims and\r\ncalled upon them to continue loyal Frenchmen. Here is the letter:\r\n\r\n     [cross symbol] JHESUS [cross symbol] MARIA.\r\n\r\n     Fair Frenchmen and loyal, of the town of Tournay, from this\r\n     place the Maid maketh known unto you these tidings: that in\r\n     eight days, by assault or otherwise, she hath driven the\r\n     English from all the strongholds they held on the River\r\n     Loire. Know ye that the Earl of Suffort, Lapoulle his\r\n     brother, the Sire of Tallebord, the Sire of Scallez and my\r\n     lords Jean Falscof and many knights and captains have been\r\n     taken, and the brother of the Earl of Suffort and Glasdas\r\n     slain. I beseech you to remain good and loyal Frenchmen; and\r\n     I beseech and entreat you that ye make yourselves ready to\r\n     come to the anointing of the fair King Charles at Rains,\r\n     where we shall shortly be, and come ye to meet us when ye\r\n     know that we draw nigh.

The town of\r\nTournai, ceded to Philip the Good by the English government, in 1423,\r\nhad not recognised its new master. Jean de Thoisy, its bishop, resided\r\nat Duke Philip's court;[1354] but it remained the King's town,[1355]\r\nand the well-known attachment of its townsfolk to the Dauphin's\r\nfortunes was exemplary and famous.[1356] The Consuls of Albi, in a\r\nshort note concerning the marvels of 1429, were careful to remark that\r\nthis northern city, so remote that they did not exactly know where it\r\nwas, still held out for France, though surrounded by France's enemies.\r\n\"The truth is that the English occupy the whole land of Normandy, and\r\nof Picardy, except Tournay,\"[1357] they wrote.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1352: Letter from Charles VII to the people of Dauphine,\r\npublished by Fauche-Prunelle, in _Bulletin de l'Academie Delphinale_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 459; to the inhabitants of Tours, in _Le Cabinet\r\nhistorique_, vol. i, C. p. 109; to those of Poitiers, by Redet, in\r\n_Les memoires de la Societe des Antiquaires de l'Ouest_, vol. iii, p.\r\n106. _Relation du greffier de la Rochelle_ in _Revue historique_, vol.\r\niv, p. 341.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1353: This is a mere form of speech. Le Tournesis has always\r\nbeen territory separate from the County of Flanders, the Bishops of\r\nwhich were the former Lords of Tournai. As early as 1187 the King of\r\nFrance nominally held sovereign sway there. In reality the town was\r\ndivided into two factions: the rich and the merchants were for the\r\nBurgundian party, the common folk for the French (De La Grange,\r\n_Troubles a Tournai_, 1422-1430).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1354: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 352.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1355: _Chambre du Roi._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1356: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 184-185. _Chronique de\r\nTournai_, ed.

They protested their loyalty, and in honour of the King\r\nand in the hope of his recovering his kingdom they had grand\r\nprocessions; but their devotion stopped there; and, when their liege\r\nLord, King Charles, urgently demanded the arrears of their\r\ncontribution, of which he said he stood in great need, their\r\nmagistrates deliberated and decided to ask leave to postpone payment\r\nagain, and for as long as possible.[1358]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1358: H. Vandenbroeck, _Extraits analytiques des anciens\r\nregistres des consaux de la ville de Tournai_, vol. ii, pp. 328-330.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Maid herself dictated this letter. It will\r\nbe noticed that therein she takes to herself the credit and the whole\r\ncredit for the victory. Her candour obliged her to do so. In her\r\nopinion God had done everything, but he had done everything through\r\nher. \"The Maid hath driven the English out of all their strongholds.\"\r\nShe alone could reveal so naive a faith in herself. Brother Pasquerel\r\nwould not have written with such saintly simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in this letter Sir John Fastolf should be\r\nreckoned among the prisoners. This mistake is not peculiar to Jeanne.\r\nThe King announces to his good towns that three English captains have\r\nbeen taken, Talbot, the Lord of Scales and Fastolf. Perceval de\r\nBoulainvilliers, in his Latin epistle to the Duke of Milan, includes\r\nFastolf, whom he calls _Fastechat_, among the thousand prisoners taken\r\nby the folk of Dauphine. Finally, a missive despatched about the 25th\r\nof June, from one of the towns of the diocese of Lucon, shows great\r\nuncertainty concerning the fate of Talbot, Fastolf and Scales, \"who\r\nare said to be either prisoners or dead.\"[1359] Possibly the French\r\nhad laid hands on some noble who resembled Fastolf in appearance or in\r\nname; or perhaps some man-at-arms in order to be held to ransom had\r\ngiven himself out to be Fastolf. The Maid's letter reached Tournai on\r\nthe 7th of July. On the morrow the town council resolved to send an\r\nembassy to King Charles of France.[1360]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1359: Letter from Perceval de Boulainvilliers, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 120.

Vandenbroeck, vol. ii, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June, or about then, the Maid caused letters to be\r\ndespatched to the Duke of Burgundy, inviting him to come to the King's\r\ncoronation. She received no reply.[1361] Duke Philip was the last man\r\nin the world to correspond with the Maid. And that she should have\r\nwritten to him courteously was a sign of her goodness of heart. As a\r\nchild in her village she had been the enemy of the Burgundians before\r\nbeing the enemy of the English, but none the less she desired the good\r\nof the kingdom and a reconciliation between Burgundians and French.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1361: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 127. These letters are now lost.\r\nJeanne alludes to them in her letter of the 17th of July, 1429. \"_Et a\r\ntrois sepmaines que je vous avoye escript et envoie bonnes lettres par\r\nun heraut...._\"]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy could not lightly pardon the ambush of Montereau;\r\nbut at no time of his life had he vowed an irreconcilable hatred of\r\nthe French. An understanding had become possible after the year 1425,\r\nwhen his brother-in-law, the Constable of France, had excluded Duke\r\nJohn's murderers from the Royal Council. As for the Dauphin Charles,\r\nhe maintained that he had had nothing to do with the crime; but among\r\nthe Burgundians he passed for an idiot.[1362] In the depths of his\r\nheart Duke Philip disliked the English. After King Henry V's death he\r\nhad refused to act as their regent in France. Then there was the\r\naffair of the Countess Jacqueline which very nearly brought about an\r\nopen rupture.[1363] For many years the House of Burgundy had been\r\nendeavouring to gain control over the Low Countries. At last Duke\r\nPhilip attained his object by marrying his second cousin, John, Duke\r\nof Brabant to Jacqueline of Bavaria, Countess of Hainault, Holland and\r\nZealand, and Lady of Friesland. Jacqueline, finding her husband\r\nintolerable, fled to England, and there, having had her marriage\r\nannulled by the Antipope, Benedict XIII, married the Duke of\r\nGloucester, the Regent's brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1362: Dom Plancher, _Histoire de Bourgogne_, vol. iv, pp.\r\nlvi, lvii.

Cosneau, _Le connetable de Richemont_, pp. 114 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1363: Dom Plancher, _Histoire de Bourgogne_, vol. iv, proofs\r\nand illustrations, p. lv.]\r\n\r\nBedford, as prudent as Gloucester was headstrong, made every effort to\r\nretain the great Duke in the English alliance; but the secret hatred\r\nhe felt for the Burgundians burst forth occasionally in sudden acts of\r\nrage. Whether he planned the assassination of the Duke and the Duke\r\nknew it, is uncertain. But at any rate it is alleged that one day the\r\ncourteous Bedford forgot himself so far as to say that Duke Philip\r\nmight well go to England and drink more beer than was good for\r\nhim.[1364] The Regent had just tactlessly offended him by refusing to\r\nlet him take possession of the town of Orleans.[1365] Now Bedford was\r\nbiting his fingers with rage. Regretting that he had refused the Duke\r\nthe key to the Loire and the heart of France, he was at present eager\r\nto offer him the province of Champagne which the French were preparing\r\nto conquer: this was indeed just the time to present some rich gift to\r\nhis powerful ally.[1366]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1364: De Barante, _Histoire des ducs de Bourgogne_, vol. v,\r\np. 270.

He remained the ally of the English,\r\nintending to make use of them but not to play into their hands, and\r\nprepared, should he find it to his advantage, to make war on the\r\nFrench before being reconciled to them; he saw no harm in that. After\r\nthe Low Countries what he cared most about were ladies and beautiful\r\npaintings, like those of the brothers Van Eyck. He would not be likely\r\ntherefore to pay much attention to a letter from the Maid of the\r\nArmagnacs.[1367]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1367: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 308-309.

But, at the news that the town had\r\nhoisted the flag of St. Andrew, as a sign of fidelity to the English\r\nand Burgundians, the army changed its route, so little did it desire\r\nto take towns by force. The march was now directed towards Auxerre,\r\nwhere a more favourable reception was expected.[1369] The Maid in her\r\nimpatience had not waited for the King. She rode with the company\r\nwhich had started first. Had she been its leader she would not have\r\nturned from a town when its cannon were directed against her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1368: According to Perceval de Cagny, p. 157; the 28th of\r\nJune, according to Chartier, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1369: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nThe King set forth two days later, with the Princes of the Blood, many\r\nknights, the main battle, as it was called, and the Sire de la\r\nTremouille, who commanded the expedition.[1370] All these troops\r\narrived before Auxerre on the 1st of July.[1371] There on the\r\nhill-slope, encircled with vineyards and cornfields, rose the\r\nramparts, towers, roofs, and belfries of the blessed Bishop Germain's\r\ncity. That town towards which in the summer sunshine, in the company\r\nof gallant knighthood, she was now riding, fully armed like a handsome\r\nSaint Maurice, Jeanne had seen only three months before, under a dark\r\nand cloudy sky; then, clad like a stable-boy, in the company of two or\r\nthree poor soldiers of fortune, she was travelling over a bad road, on\r\nher way to the Dauphin Charles.[1372]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1370: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 90. _Chronique\r\nde la Pucelle_, pp. 309, 310.

Morosini, vol. iii, p. 142, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1372: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 54, 222.]\r\n\r\nSince 1424 the County of Auxerre had belonged to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nupon whom it had been bestowed by the Regent. The Duke governed it\r\nthrough a bailie and a captain.[1373]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1373: Abbe Lebeuf, _Histoire ecclesiastique et civile\r\nd'Auxerre_, vol. ii, p. 251; vol. iii, pp. 302, 506.]\r\n\r\nThe lord Bishop, Messire Jean de Corbie, formerly Bishop of Mende, was\r\nthought to be on the Dauphin's side.[1374] The Chapter of the\r\nCathedral on the other hand held to Burgundy.[1375] Twelve jurors,\r\nelected by the burgesses and other townsfolk, administered the affairs\r\nof the city. One can easily imagine that fear must have been the\r\ndominant sentiment in their hearts when they saw the royal army\r\napproaching. Men-at-arms, no matter whether they wore the white cross\r\nor the red, inspired all town dwellers with a well-grounded terror.\r\nAnd, in order to turn from their gates these violent and murderous\r\nthieves, the townsfolk were capable of resorting to the strongest\r\nmeasures, even to that of putting their hands in their purses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1374: Chardon, _Histoire de la ville d'Auxerre_, Auxerre,\r\n1834 (2 vols. in 8vo), vol. ii, p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1375: Dom Plancher, _Histoire de Bourgogne_, vol. iv, p. 76.\r\nChardon, _Histoire de la ville d'Auxerre_, vol. ii, pp. 257 _et seq._\r\nVallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i, p. 383.]\r\n\r\nThe royal heralds summoned the people of Auxerre to receive the King\r\nas their natural and lawful lord. Such a summons, backed by lances,\r\nplaced them in a very embarrassing position. Alike by refusing and by\r\nconsenting these good folk ran great risk. To transfer their\r\nallegiance was no light matter; their lives and their goods were\r\ninvolved. Foreseeing this danger, and conscious of their weakness,\r\nthey had entered into a league with the cities of Champagne. The\r\nobject of the league was to relieve its members from the burden of\r\nreceiving men-at-arms and the peril of having two hostile masters.\r\nCertain of the townsfolk therefore presented themselves before King\r\nCharles and promised him such submission as should be accorded by the\r\ntowns of Troyes, Chalons, and Reims.[1376]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1376: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 90. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 108. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 313. Monstrelet, vol.\r\niv, p. 436. Abbe Lebeuf, _Histoire ecclesiastique d'Auxerre_, vol. ii,\r\np. 51. Chardon, _Histoire de la ville d'Auxerre_, vol. ii, p. 259.]\r\n\r\nThis was not obedience, neither was it rebellion. Negotiations were\r\nbegun; ambassadors went from the town to the camp and from the camp to\r\nthe town. Finally the confederates, who were not lacking in\r\nintelligence, proposed an acceptable compromise,--one that princes\r\nwere constantly concluding with each other, to wit, a truce.\r\n\r\nThey said to the King: \"We entreat and request you to pass on, and we\r\nask you to agree to refrain from fighting.\" And, in order to secure\r\ntheir request being granted, they gave two thousand crowns to the\r\nSire de la Tremouille, who, it is said, kept them without a blush.\r\nFurther, the townsfolk undertook to revictual the army in return for\r\nmoney down; and that was worth considering, for there was famine in\r\nthe camp.[1377] This truce by no means pleased the men-at-arms, who\r\nthereby lost a fine opportunity for robbery and pillage. Murmurs\r\narose; many lords and captains said that it would not be difficult to\r\ntake the town, and that its capture should have been attempted. The\r\nMaid, who was always receiving promises of victory from her Voices,\r\nnever ceased calling the soldiers to arms.[1378] Unaffected by any of\r\nthese things, the King concluded the proposed truce; for he cared not\r\nby force of arms to obtain more than could be compassed by peaceful\r\nmethods. Had he attacked the town he might have taken it and held it\r\nin his mercy; but it would have meant certain pillage, murder,\r\nburning, and ravishing. On his heels would have come the Burgundians,\r\nand there would have been plundering, burning, ravishing, massacring\r\nover again. How many examples had there not been already of unhappy\r\ntowns captured and then lost almost immediately, devastated by the\r\nFrench, devastated by the English and the Burgundians, when each\r\ncitizen kept in his coffer a red cap and a white cap, which he wore in\r\nturns! Was there to be no end to these massacres and abominations,\r\nresentment against which caused the Armagnacs to be cursed throughout\r\nl'Ile de France, and which made it so hard for the lawful King to\r\nrecover his town of Paris. The royal Council thought the time had come\r\nto put an end to these things. It was of opinion that Charles of\r\nValois would the more easily reconquer his inheritance if, while\r\nmanifesting his power, he showed himself lenient and exercised royal\r\nclemency, as in arms and yet pursuing peace, he continued his march to\r\nReims.[1379]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1377: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 90. _Chronique\r\nde la Pucelle_, p. 313.

Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 91. _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 264-265.]\r\n\r\nIn this strong town there was a garrison of between five and six\r\nhundred men at the most.[1382] A bailie, Messire Jean de Dinteville,\r\ntwo captains, the Sires de Rochefort and de Plancy, commanded in the\r\ntown for King Henry and for the Duke of Burgundy.[1383] Troyes was a\r\nmanufacturing town; the source of its wealth was the cloth\r\nmanufacture. True, this industry had long been declining through\r\ncompetition and the removal of markets; its ruin was being\r\nprecipitated by the general poverty and the insecurity of the roads.\r\nNevertheless the cloth workers' guild maintained its importance and\r\nsent a number of magistrates to the Council.[1384]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1382: Jean Chartier, vol. i, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1383: Th.

Roserot, in _Collection des documents inedits\r\nrelatifs a la ville de Troyes_ (1886).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1384: F. Bourquelot, _Les foires de Champagne_, Paris, 1865,\r\nvol. i, p. 65. Louis Batiffol, _Jean Jouvenel, prevot des marchands_,\r\nParis, 1894, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nIn 1420, these merchants had sworn to the treaty which promised the\r\nFrench crown to the House of Lancaster; they were then at the mercy of\r\nEnglish and Burgundians. For the holding of those great fairs, to\r\nwhich they took their cloth, they must needs live at peace with their\r\nBurgundian neighbours, and if the _Godons_ had closed the ports of the\r\nSeine against their bales, they would have died of hunger. Wherefore\r\nthe notables of the town had turned English, which did not mean that\r\nthey would always remain English. Within the last few weeks great\r\nchanges had taken place in the kingdom; and the Gilles Laiguises, the\r\nHennequins, the Jouvenels did not pride themselves on remaining\r\nunchanged amidst vicissitudes of fortune which were transferring the\r\npower from one side to the other. The French victories gave them food\r\nfor reflection. Along the banks of the streams, which wound through\r\nthe city, there were weavers, dyers, curriers who were Burgundian at\r\nheart.[1385] As for the Churchmen, if they were thrilled by no love\r\nfor the Armagnacs, they felt none the less that King Charles was sent\r\nto them by a special dispensation of divine providence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1385: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Troyes was my lord Jean Laiguise, son of Master Huet\r\nLaiguise, one of the first to swear to the treaty of 1420.[1386] The\r\nChapter had elected him without waiting for the permission of the\r\nRegent, who declared against the election, not that he disliked the\r\nnew pontiff; Messire Jean Laiguise had sucked hatred of the Armagnacs\r\nand respect for the Rose of Lancaster from his _alma mater_ of Paris.\r\nBut my Lord of Bedford could not forgive any slighting of his\r\nsovereign rights.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1386: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. xiii, cols. 514-516.\r\nCourtalon-Delaistre, _Topographie historique du diocese de Troyes_\r\n(Troyes, 1783, 3 vols. in 8vo), vol. i, p. 384.

De Pange, _Le pays de\r\nJeanne d'Arc, le fief et l'arriere-fief_, Paris, 1902, in 8vo, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he incurred the censure of the whole Church of\r\nFrance and was judged by the bishops worse than the cruellest tyrants\r\nof Scripture--Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Artaxerxes[1387]--who, when\r\nthey chastised Israel had spared the Levites. More wicked than they\r\nand more sacrilegious, my Lord of Bedford threatened the privileges of\r\nthe Gallican Church, when, on behalf of the Holy See, he robbed the\r\nbishops of their patronage, levied a double tithe on the French\r\nclergy, and commanded churchmen to surrender to him the contributions\r\nthey had been receiving for forty years. That he was acting with the\r\nPope's consent made his conduct none the less execrable in the eyes of\r\nthe French bishops. The episcopal lords resolved to appeal from a Pope\r\nill informed to one with wider knowledge; for they held the authority\r\nof the Bishop of Rome to be insignificant in comparison with the\r\nauthority of the Council. They groaned: the abomination of desolation\r\nwas laying waste Christian Gaul. In order to pacify the Church of\r\nFrance thus roused against him, my lord of Bedford convoked at Paris\r\nthe bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Sens, which included the\r\ndioceses of Paris, Troyes, Auxerre, Nevers, Meaux, Chartres, and\r\nOrleans.[1388]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1387: Simeon Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. ccxxii,\r\naccording to Labbe and Cossart, _Sacro-Sancta-Consilia_, vol. xii,\r\ncol. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1388: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. ccxx and proofs\r\nand illustrations, ccix, pp. 238-239. Robillard de Beaurepaire, _Les\r\netats de Normandie sous la domination anglaise_, Evreux, 1859, in\r\n8vo.]\r\n\r\nMessire Jean Laiguise attended this Convocation. The Synod was held at\r\nParis, in the Priory of Saint-Eloi, under the presidency of the\r\nArchbishop, from the 1st of March till the 23rd of April, 1429.[1389]\r\nThe assembled bishops represented to my Lord the Regent the sorry\r\nplight of the ecclesiastical lords: the peasants, pillaged by\r\nsoldiers, no longer paid their dues; the lands of the Church were\r\nlying waste; divine service had ceased to be held because there was no\r\nmoney with which to support public worship. Unanimously they refused\r\nto pay the Pope and the Regent the double tithe; and they threatened\r\nto appeal from the Pope to the Council. As for despoiling the clergy\r\nof all the contributions they had received during the last forty\r\nyears, that, they declared, would be impious; and with great charity\r\nthey reminded my Lord of Bedford of the fate reserved by God's\r\njudgment for the impious even in this world. \"The Prince,\" they said,\r\n\"should beware of the miseries and sorrows already fallen upon a\r\nmultitude of princes, who with such demands had oppressed the Church\r\nwhich God redeemed with his own precious blood: some had perished by\r\nthe sword, some had been driven into exile, others had been despoiled\r\nof their illustrious sovereignties. Wherefore such as set themselves\r\nto enslave the Church, the Bride of God, may not hope to deserve the\r\ngrace of his divine Majesty.\"[1390]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1389: Labbe and Cossart, _Sacro-Sancta-Consilia_, vol. xii,\r\ncol. 392.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1390: Labbe and Cossart, _Sacro-Sancta-Consilia_, vol. xii,\r\ncol. 390, 399.]\r\n\r\nJean Laiguise's sentiments towards the English Regent were those of\r\nthe Synod. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that the Bishop of\r\nTroyes desired the death of the sinner, or even that he was hostile to\r\nthe English.[1391] The Church is usually capable of temporising with\r\nthe powers of this world. Wide is her mercy, and great her\r\nlongsuffering. She threatens oft before striking and receives the\r\nrepentance of the sinner at the first sign of contrition. But we may\r\nbelieve that if Charles of Valois were to win the power and show the\r\nwill to protect the Church of France, the Lord Bishop and the Chapter\r\nof Troyes would fear lest if they resisted him they might be resisting\r\nGod himself, since all power comes from God who _deposuit potentes_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1391: De Pange, _Le pays de Jeanne d'Arc, le fief et\r\nl'arriere-fief_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nKing Charles had not ventured to enter Champagne without taking\r\nmeasures for his safety; he knew on what he could rely in the town of\r\nTroyes. He had received information and promises; he maintained secret\r\nrelations with several burgesses of the city, and those none of the\r\nleast.[1392] During the first fortnight of May, a royal notary, ten\r\nclerks and leading merchants, on their way to the king, were arrested\r\njust outside the walls, on the Paris road, by the Sire de\r\nChateauvillain,[1393] a captain in the English service. This mission\r\nwas probably fulfilled by others more fortunate. It is easy to divine\r\nwhat questions were discussed at these audiences. The merchants would\r\nask whether Charles, if he became their Lord, would guarantee absolute\r\nfreedom to their trade; the clerks would ask his promise to respect\r\nthe goods of the Church. And the King doubtless was not sparing of his\r\npledges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1392: J. Rogier in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 285.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1393: Th. Boutiot in _Histoire de la ville de Troyes_, vol.\r\nii, pp. 316 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe Maid, with one division of the army, halted before the stronghold\r\nof Saint-Phal, belonging to Philibert de Vaudrey, commander of the\r\ntown of Tonnerre, in the service of the Duke of Burgundy.[1394] In\r\nthat place of Saint-Phal, Jeanne beheld approaching her a Franciscan\r\nfriar, who was crossing himself and sprinkling holy water, for he\r\nfeared lest she were the devil, and dared not draw near without having\r\nfirst exorcised the evil spirit. It was Friar Richard who was coming\r\nfrom Troyes.[1395] It will be interesting to see who this monk was as\r\nfar as we can tell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1394: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 288. Th.

Advent, sometimes called Saint\r\nMartin's Lent, begins on the Sunday which falls between the 27th of\r\nNovember and the 3rd of December. It lasts four weeks, which\r\nChristians spend in making themselves ready to celebrate the mystery\r\nof the Nativity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1396: Ed.

Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p.\r\nccxxxix.]\r\n\r\n\"Sow, sow your seed, my good folk,\" he said. \"Sow beans ready for the\r\nharvest, for He who is to come will come quickly.\"[1398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1398: _Journal du siege_, p. 110. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 315.]\r\n\r\nBy beans he meant the good works to be performed before Our Lord\r\nshould come in the clouds to judge the quick and the dead. Now it was\r\nimportant to sow those good works quickly, for the harvest-tide was\r\ndrawing nigh. The coming of Antichrist was but shortly to precede the\r\nend of the world and the consummation of the ages. In the month of\r\nApril, 1429, Friar Richard went to Paris; the Synod of the Province of\r\nSens was then holding its final session. It is possible that the good\r\nFriar was summoned to the great city by the Bishop of Troyes who was\r\npresent at the Synod; but at any rate it would appear that it was not\r\nthe rights of the Gallican Church the wandering monk went there to\r\ndefend.[1399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1399: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 233. Labbe,\r\nBoutiot.]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, he preached his first sermon at\r\nSainte-Genevieve; on the next and the following days, until Sunday,\r\nthe 24th, he preached every morning, from five until ten or eleven\r\no'clock, in the open air, on a platform, erected against the\r\ncharnel-house of the Innocents, on the spot whereon was celebrated the\r\ndance of death. Around the platform, about nine feet high, there\r\ncrowded five or six thousand persons, to whom he announced the speedy\r\ncoming of Antichrist and the end of the world.[1400] \"In Syria,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I met bands of Jews; I asked them whither they were going, and\r\nthey replied: 'We are wending in a multitude towards Babylon, for of a\r\ntruth the Messiah is born among men, and he will restore unto us our\r\ninheritance, and he will bring us again to the land of promise.' Thus\r\nspake those Syrian Jews. Now Scripture teaches us that He, whom they\r\ncall the Messiah, is in truth that Antichrist, of whom it is said he\r\nshall be born in Babylon, capital of the kingdom of Persia, he shall\r\nbe brought up at Bethsaida and in his youth he shall dwell at\r\nChorazin. Wherefore our Lord said: 'Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto\r\nthee, Bethsaida.' The year 1430,\" added Friar Richard, \"shall witness\r\ngreater marvels than have ever been seen before.[1401] The time\r\ndraweth nigh. He is born, the man of sin, the child of perdition, the\r\nwicked one, the beast vomited forth from the abyss, the abomination of\r\ndesolation; he came out of the tribe of Dan, of whom it is written:\r\n'Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path.' Soon shall\r\nreturn to the earth the prophets Elijah and Enoch, Moses, Jeremiah and\r\nSaint John the Evangelist; and soon shall dawn that day of wrath which\r\nshall grind the age in a mill and beat it in a mortar, according to\r\nthe testimony of David and the Sibyl.\"[1402] Then the good Brother\r\nconcluded by calling upon them to repent, to do penance and to\r\nrenounce empty riches. In short, in the opinion of the clerks, he was\r\na man of worship and an orator. His sermons produced more devoutness\r\namong the people, it was thought, than those of all the sermonizers\r\nwho for the last century had been preaching in the town. And it was\r\ntime that he came, for in those days the folk of Paris were greatly\r\naddicted to games of chance; yea, even priests unblushingly indulged\r\nin them, and seven years before, a canon of Saint-Merry, a great lover\r\nof dice was known to have gamed in his own house.[1403] Despite war\r\nand famine, the women of Paris loaded themselves with ornaments. They\r\ntroubled more about their beauty than about the salvation of their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1400: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1401: _Ibid._, p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1402: Th. Basin, _Histoire des regnes de Charles VII et de\r\nLouis XI_, vol. iv, pp. 103, 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1403: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nFriar Richard thundered most loudly against the draught boards of the\r\nmen and the ornaments of the women. One day notably, when he was\r\npreaching at Boulogne-la-Petite, he cried down dice and\r\n_hennins_,[1404] and spoke with such power that the hearts of those\r\nwho listened were changed. On returning to their homes, the citizens\r\nthrew into the streets gaming-tables, draught-boards, cards, billiard\r\ncues and balls, dice and dice-boxes, and made great fires before their\r\ndoors. More than one hundred of these fires continued burning in the\r\nstreets for three or four hours. Women followed the good example set\r\nby the men that day, and the next they burnt in public their\r\nhead-dresses, pads, ornaments, and the pieces of leather or whalebone\r\non which they mounted the fronts of their hoods. Young misses threw\r\noff their horns[1405] and their tails,[1406] ashamed to clothe\r\nthemselves in the devil's garb.[1407]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1404: A very high head-dress, fashionable in the fifteenth\r\ncentury (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1405: _Cornes_, the high-horned head-dress (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1406: _Queues_, trains (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1407: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 234, 235.]\r\n\r\nThe good Brother likewise caused to be burnt the mandrake roots which\r\nmany folk kept in their houses.[1408] Those roots are sometimes in\r\nthe form of an ugly little man, of a curious and devilish aspect. On\r\nthat account possibly, singular virtues are attributed to them. These\r\nmannikins were dressed in fine linen and silk and were kept in the\r\nbelief that they would bring good luck and procure wealth. Witches\r\nmade much of them; and those who believed that the Maid was a witch\r\naccused her of carrying a mandrake on her person. Friar Richard hated\r\nthese magic roots all the more strongly because he believed in their\r\npower of attracting wealth, the root of all evil. Once again his word\r\nwas obeyed; and many a Parisian threw away his mandrake in horror,\r\nalbeit he had bought it dear from some old wife who knew more than was\r\ngood for her.[1409] Friar Richard caused the Parisians to replace\r\nthese evil treasures by objects of greater edification,--pewter\r\nmedals, on which was stamped the name of Jesus, to the worship of whom\r\nhe was especially devoted.[1410]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1408: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1409: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 89, 213. _Journal d'un bourgeois\r\nde Paris_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1410: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 242, 243.\r\nVallet de Viriville, _Notes sur deux medailles de plomb relatives a\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, in _Revue archeologique_, 1861, pp. 429, 433.]\r\n\r\nHaving preached ten times in the town and once in the village of\r\nBoulogne, the good Brother announced his return to Burgundy and took\r\nhis leave of the Parisians.\r\n\r\n\"I will pray for you,\" he said; \"pray for me. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon all the folk, high and lowly, wept bitterly and copiously,\r\nas if each one were bearing to the grave his dearest friend. He wept\r\nwith them and consented to delay his departure for a little.[1411]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1411: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 1st of May, he was to preach to the devout Parisians\r\nfor the last time. Montmartre, the very spot where Saint Denis had\r\nsuffered martyrdom, was the place chosen for the meeting of the\r\nfaithful. In those unhappy days the hill was well-nigh uninhabited.\r\nBut on the evening before that day more than six thousand people\r\nflocked to the mount to be certain of having good places; and there\r\nthey passed the night, some in deserted hovels, but the majority in\r\nthe open, under the stars. When the morning came no Friar Richard\r\nappeared, and in vain they waited for him. Disappointed and sad, at\r\nlength they learnt that the Friar had been forbidden to preach.[1412]\r\nHe had said nothing in his sermons to offend the English. The\r\nParisians who had heard him believed him to be a good friend to the\r\nRegent and to the Duke of Burgundy. Perhaps he had taken flight owing\r\nto a report that the theologians of the University intended to proceed\r\nagainst him. His views concerning the end of the world were indeed\r\nboth singular and dangerous.[1413]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1412: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1413: It is yet to be explained how the author of the diary\r\ncalled _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_ avoided being scandalised by\r\nthem, orthodox university professor as he was; on the contrary he\r\nseems to have found the views of the good father edifying. Th. Basin,\r\n_Histoire des regnes de Charles VII et de Louis XI_, vol. iv, p. 104.]\r\n\r\nFriar Richard had gone off to Auxerre. Thence he went preaching\r\nthrough Burgundy and Champagne. If he was on the King's side he did\r\nnot let it appear. For in the month of June the folk of Champagne, and\r\nthe inhabitants of Chalons especially, deemed him a worthy man and\r\nattached to the Duke of Burgundy.[1414] And we have seen that on the\r\n4th of July he suspected the Maid of being either the devil or\r\npossessed by a devil.[1415]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1414: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1415: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 100, see _ante_, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nShe understood. When she saw the good Brother crossing himself and\r\nsprinkling holy water she knew that he took her for something\r\nevil,--for a phantom fashioned by the spirit of wickedness, or at\r\nleast for a witch.[1416] However, she was by no means offended as she\r\nhad been by the suspicions of Messire Jean Fournier. The priest, to\r\nwhom she had confessed, could not be forgiven for having doubted\r\nwhether she were a good Christian.[1417] But Friar Richard did not\r\nknow her, had never seen her. Besides, she was growing accustomed to\r\nsuch treatment. The Constable, Brother Yves Milbeau, and many others\r\nwho came to her asked whether she were from God or the devil.[1418] It\r\nwas without a trace of anger, although in a slightly ironical tone,\r\nthat she said to the preacher: \"Approach boldly, I shall not fly\r\naway.\"[1419]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1416: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1417: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 446.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1418: Gruel, _Chronique de Richemont_, p. 71. Eberhard\r\nWindecke, pp. 178, 179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1419: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 100.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Friar Richard, by the ordeal of holy water and by the sign\r\nof the cross, had proved that the damsel was not a devil and that\r\nthere was no devil in her. And when she said she had come from God he\r\nbelieved her with all his heart and esteemed her an angel of the\r\nLord.[1420]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1420: _Ibid._, pp. 99, 100.]\r\n\r\nHe confided to her the reason for his coming.[1421] The inhabitants of\r\nTroyes doubted whether she were of God; to resolve their doubts he had\r\ncome to Saint-Phal. Now he knew she was of God, and he was not\r\namazed; for he knew that the year 1430 would witness greater marvels\r\nthan had ever been seen before, and one day or other he was expecting\r\nto behold the Prophet Elias walking and conversing with men.[1422]\r\nFrom that moment he threw in his lot with the party of the Maid and\r\nthe Dauphin. It was not the Maid's prophecies concerning the realm of\r\nFrance that attracted him to her. The world was too near its end for\r\nhim to take any interest in the re-establishment of the madman's son\r\nin his inheritance. But he expected that once the kingdom of Jesus\r\nChrist had been established in the Land of the Lilies, Jeanne, the\r\nprophetess, and Charles, the temporal vicar of Jesus Christ, would\r\nlead the people of Christendom to deliver the Holy Sepulchre. That\r\nwould be a meritorious work and one which must be accomplished before\r\nthe consummation of the ages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1421: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, p. 342.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1422: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 235.]\r\n\r\nTo the burgesses and inhabitants of the town of Troyes Jeanne dictated\r\na letter. Herein, calling herself the servant of the King of Heaven\r\nand speaking in the name of God Himself, in terms gentle yet urgent,\r\nshe called upon them to render obedience to King Charles of France,\r\nand warned them that whether they would or no she with the King would\r\nenter into all the towns of the holy kingdom and bring them peace.\r\nHere is the letter:[1423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1423: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 287-288.]\r\n\r\n     JHESUS [cross symbol] MARIA\r\n\r\n     Good friends and beloved, an it please you, ye lords,\r\n     burgesses and inhabitants of the town of Troies, Jehanne the\r\n     Maid doth call upon and make known unto you on behalf of the\r\n     King of Heaven, her sovereign and liege Lord, in whose\r\n     service royal she is every day, that ye render true\r\n     obedience and fealty to the Fair King of France. Whosoever\r\n     may come against him, he shall shortly be in Reins\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: so in original] and in Paris, and in\r\n     his good towns of his holy kingdom, with the aid of King\r\n     Jhesus. Ye loyal Frenchmen, come forth to King Charles and\r\n     fail him not. And if ye come have no fear for your bodies\r\n     nor for your goods. An if ye come not, I promise you and on\r\n     your lives I maintain it, that with God's help we shall\r\n     enter into all the towns of the holy kingdom and shall there\r\n     establish peace, whosoever may oppose us. To God I commend\r\n     you. God keep you if it be his will. Answer speedily. Before\r\n     the city of Troyes, written at Saint-Fale, Tuesday the\r\n     fourth day of July.[1424]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1424: It should be Monday, 4th July.]\r\n\r\nOn the back:\r\n\r\n     \"To the lords and burgesses of the city of Troyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Maid gave this letter to Friar Richard, who undertook to carry it\r\nto the townsfolk.[1425]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1425: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 290.]\r\n\r\nFrom Saint-Phal the army advanced towards Troyes along the Roman\r\nroad.[1426] When they heard of the army's approach, the Council of the\r\ntown assembled on Tuesday, the 5th, early in the morning, and sent the\r\npeople of Reims a missive of which the following is the purport:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1426: Th. Boutiot, _Histoire de la ville de Troyes_, vol.\r\nii, p. 493.]\r\n\r\n     \"This day do we expect the enemies of King Henry and the\r\n     Duke of Burgundy who come to besiege us. In view of the\r\n     design of these our foes and having considered the just\r\n     cause we support and the aid of our princes promised unto\r\n     us, we have resolved in council, no matter what may be the\r\n     strength of our enemies, to continue in our obedience waxing\r\n     ever greater to King Henry and to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\n     even until death. And this have we sworn on the precious\r\n     body of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore we pray the\r\n     citizens of Reims to take thought for us as brethren and\r\n     loyal friends, and to send to my Lord the Regent and the\r\n     Duke of Burgundy to beseech and entreat them to take pity on\r\n     their poor subjects and come to their succour.\"[1427]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1427: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 288, 289.]\r\n\r\nOn that same day, in the morning, from his lodging at\r\nBrinion-l'Archeveque, King Charles despatched his heralds bearing\r\nclosed letters, signed by his hand, sealed with his seal, addressed to\r\nthe members of the Council of the town of Troyes. Therein he made\r\nknown unto them that by the advice of his Council, he had undertaken\r\nto go to Reims, there to receive his anointing, that his intention was\r\nto enter the city of Troyes on the morrow, wherefore he summoned and\r\ncommanded them to render the obedience they owed him and prepare to\r\nreceive him. He wisely made a point of reassuring them as to his\r\nintentions, which were not to avenge the past. Such was not his will,\r\nhe said, but let them comport themselves towards their sovereign as\r\nthey ought, and he would forget all and maintain them in his\r\nfavour.[1428]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1428: _Ibid._, p. 287. Th. Boutiot, _Histoire de la ville de\r\nTroyes_, vol. ii, p. 494.]\r\n\r\nThe Council refused to admit King Charles' heralds within the town;\r\nbut they received his letters, read them, deliberated over them, and\r\nmade known to the heralds the result of their deliberations which was\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     \"The lords, knights and squires who are in the town, on\r\n     behalf of King Henry and the Duke of Burgundy, have sworn\r\n     with us, inhabitants of the city, that we will not receive\r\n     into the town any who are stronger than we, without the\r\n     express command of the Duke of Burgundy. Having regard to\r\n     their oath, those who are in the town would not dare to\r\n     admit King Charles.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the councillors added for their excuse:\r\n\r\n     \"Whatever we the citizens may wish we must consider the men\r\n     of war in the city who are stronger than we.\"[1429]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1429: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThe councillors had King Charles' letter posted up and below it their\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nIn council they read the letter the Maid had dictated at Saint-Phal\r\nand entrusted to Friar Richard. The monk had not prepared them to give\r\nit a favourable reception, for they laughed at it heartily. \"There is\r\nno rhyme or reason in it,\" they said. \"'Tis but a jest.\"[1430] They\r\nthrew it in the fire without sending a reply. Jeanne was a\r\nbraggart,[1431] they said. And they added: \"We certify her to be mad\r\nand possessed of the devil.\"[1432]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1430: _Ibid._, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1431: In the _Mystery of the siege of Orleans_, the\r\nEnglishman Falconbridge likewise treats Jeanne as a boaster, lines\r\n12689-90:\r\n\r\n    _'Y nous fault prandre la coquarde,\r\n    Qui veult les Francois gouverner._\r\n\r\n\"We must capture that braggart who desires to govern the French.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1432: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThat same day, at nine o'clock in the morning, the army began to march\r\nby the walls and take up its position round the town.[1433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1433: _Ibid._ Th. Boutiot, _Histoire de la ville de Troyes_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 492.]\r\n\r\nThose who encamped to the south west could thence admire the long\r\nwalls, the strong gates, the high towers and the belfry of the city\r\nrising in the midst of a vast plain. On their right they would see\r\nabove the roofs the church of Saint-Pierre, the huge structure of\r\nwhich was devoid of tower and steeple.[1434] It was there that eight\r\nyears before had been celebrated the betrothal of King Henry V of\r\nEngland to the Lady Catherine of France. For in that town of Troyes,\r\nQueen Ysabeau and Duke Jean had made King Charles VI, bereft of sense\r\nand memory, sign away the Kingdom of the Lilies to the King of England\r\nand put his name to the ruin of Charles of Valois. At her daughter's\r\nbetrothal, Madame Ysabeau was present wearing a robe of blue silk\r\ndamask and a coat of black velvet lined with the skins of fifteen\r\nhundred minevers.[1435] After the ceremony she caused to be brought\r\nfor her entertainment her singing birds, goldfinches, chaffinches,\r\nsiskins and linnets.[1436]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1434: L.

They\r\ndesired above all things to see the King.[1437]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1437: It is impossible to take seriously those protestations\r\nof loyalty to the English, addressed to the people of Reims by the\r\ntownsfolk of Troyes, when the latter were on the point of surrendering\r\nto the French King, and especially after the reply they had just sent\r\nto King Charles's letters. See J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 289.\r\n\"Which reply having been made each of them had gone up on to the\r\nwalls, and assumed his guard with the intent and in the firm\r\nresolution that if any attack were made on them, they would resist to\r\nthe death.\"]\r\n\r\nThe town was strongly defended. The Duke of Burgundy had long been\r\nkeeping up the fortifications. In 1417 and 1419 the people of Troyes,\r\nlike those of Orleans in 1428, had pulled down their suburbs and\r\ndestroyed all the houses outside the town for two or three hundred\r\npaces from the ramparts. The arsenal was well furnished; the stores\r\noverflowed with victuals; but the Anglo-Burgundian garrison amounted\r\nonly to between five and six hundred men.[1438]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1438: J. Chartier, vol. i, p. 92. Th. Boutiot, _Histoire de\r\nla ville de Troyes_, vol. ii, pp. 391, 418, 419. A. Assier, _Une cite\r\nchampenoise au XV'e siecle_, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nOn that day also, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the Councillors of\r\nthe town of Troyes sent to inform the people of Reims of the arrival\r\nof the Armagnacs, and despatched to them copies of the letter from\r\nCharles of Valois, of their reply to it and of the Maid's letter,\r\nwhich they cannot therefore have burned immediately. They likewise\r\ncommunicated to them their resolution to resist to the death in case\r\nthey should receive succour. In like manner they wrote to the people\r\nof Chalons to tell them of the Dauphin's coming; and to them they made\r\nknown that the letter of Jeanne the Maid had been brought to Troyes by\r\nFriar Richard the preacher.[1439]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1439: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 289, 290.]\r\n\r\nThese writings amounted to saying: like all citizens in such\r\ncircumstances, we are in danger of being hanged either by the\r\nBurgundians or by the Armagnacs, which would be very grievous. To\r\navoid this calamity as far as in us lies, we give King Charles of\r\nValois to understand that we do not open our gates to him because the\r\ngarrison prevents us and that we are the weaker, which is true. And\r\nwe make known to our Lords, the Regent and the Duke of Burgundy, that\r\nthe garrison being too weak to defend us, which is true, we ask for\r\nsuccour, which is loyal; and we trust that the succour will not be\r\nsent, for if it were we should have to endure a siege, and risk being\r\ntaken by assault which for us merchants would be grievous. But, having\r\nasked for succour and not receiving it, we may then surrender without\r\nreproach. The important point is to cause the garrison, fortunately a\r\nsmall one, to make off. Five hundred men are too few for defence, but\r\ntoo many for surrender. As for enjoining the citizens of Reims to\r\ndemand succour for themselves and for us, that is merely to prove our\r\ngood-will to the Duke of Burgundy; and we risk nothing by it, for we\r\nknow that our trusty comrades of Reims will take care that when they\r\nask for succour they do not receive it, and that they will await a\r\nfavourable opportunity for opening their gates to King Charles, who\r\ncomes with a strong army. And now to conclude, we will resist to the\r\ndeath if we are succoured, which God forbid!\r\n\r\nSuch were the crafty thoughts of those dwellers in Champagne. The\r\ncitizens fired a few stone bullets on to the French. The garrison\r\nskirmished awhile and returned into the town.[1440]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1440: _Journal du siege_, p. 109. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\npp. 314, 315. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 91. Th. Boutiot,\r\n_Histoire de la ville de Troyes_, vol. ii, p. 497.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile King Charles' army was stricken with famine.[1441] The\r\nArchbishop of Embrun's counsel to provide the army with victuals by\r\nmeans of human wisdom was easier to give than to follow. There were\r\nbetween six and seven thousand men in camp who had not broken bread\r\nfor a week. The men-at-arms were reduced to feeding on pounded ears of\r\ncorn still green and on the new beans they found in abundance. Then\r\nthey called to mind how during Saint Martin's Lent Friar Richard had\r\nsaid to the folk of Troyes: \"Sow beans broadcast: He who is to come\r\nshall come shortly.\" What the good brother had said of the spiritual\r\nseed-time was interpreted literally: by a curious misunderstanding,\r\nwhat had been uttered concerning the coming of the Messiah was applied\r\nto the coming of King Charles. Friar Richard was held to be the\r\nprophet of the Armagnacs and the men-at-arms really believed that this\r\nevangelical preacher had caused the beans they gathered to grow; thus\r\nhad he provided for their nourishment by his excellence, his wisdom\r\nand his penetration into the counsels of God, who gave manna unto the\r\npeople of Israel in the desert.[1442]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1441: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1442: _Journal du siege_, pp. 109, 110. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 315.]\r\n\r\nThe King, who had been lodging at Brinion since the 4th of July,\r\narrived before Troyes in the afternoon of Friday the 8th.[1443] That\r\nvery day he held council of war with the commanders and princes of the\r\nblood to decide whether they should remain before the town until by\r\ndint of promises[1444] or threats they obtained its submission, or\r\nwhether they should pass on, leaving it to itself, as they had done at\r\nAuxerre.[1445]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1443: Perceval de Cagny, p. 157. Nevertheless see also\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 143, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1444: \"And always desiring and discussing the submission of\r\nthis city.\" Jean Chartier, vol. i, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1445: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 13.

Chartier and the _Chronique de la Pucelle_ put words into the\r\nmouths of Regnault de Chartres and Robert le Macon which are very\r\nimprobable.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion had lasted long when the Maid arrived and prophesied:\r\n\r\n\"Fair Dauphin,\" said she, \"command your men to attack the town of\r\nTroyes and delay no further in councils too prolonged, for, in God's\r\nname, before three days, I will cause you to enter the town, which\r\nshall be yours by love or by force and courage. And false Burgundy\r\nshall look right foolish.\"[1446]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1446: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 13. Evidence of Dunois.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 317. _Journal du siege_, p. 110. Jean\r\nChartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 94.]\r\n\r\nWherefore had they contrary to their custom summoned her to the\r\nCouncil? It was merely a question of firing a few cannon balls and\r\npretending to scale the walls, in short, of making a false attack.\r\nSuch a feigned assault was due to the people of Troyes, who could not\r\ndecently surrender save to some display of force; and besides the\r\nlower orders must be frightened, for they remained at heart\r\nBurgundian. Probably my Lord of Treves[1447] or another judged that\r\nthe little Saint by appearing beneath the ramparts of Troyes would\r\nstrike a religious terror into the weavers of the city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1447: Jean Chartier, vol. i, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThey had only to leave her to go her own way. The Council over, she\r\nmounted her horse, and lance in hand hurried to the moat, followed by\r\na crowd of knights, squires, and craftsmen.[1448] The point of attack\r\nwas to be the north west wall, between the Madeleine and the Comporte\r\nGates.[1449] Jeanne, who firmly believed that the town would be taken\r\nby her, spent the night inciting her people to bring faggots and put\r\nthe artillery in position. \"To the assault,\" she cried, and signed to\r\nthem to throw hurdles into the trenches.[1450]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1448: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 13, 14, 117.

The lower orders, imagining the\r\ntown already taken, and expecting the French to come to pillage,\r\nmassacre and ravish, as was the custom, took refuge in the churches.\r\nAs for the clerics and notables, this was just what they wanted.[1451]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1451: _Ibid._, p. 117. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i,\r\np. 96. J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 296.]\r\n\r\nBeing assured by Charles of Valois that they might come to him in\r\nsafety, the Lord Bishop Jean Laiguise, my Lord Guillaume Andouillette,\r\nMaster of the Hospital, the Dean of the Chapter, the clergy and the\r\nnotables went to the King.[1452]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1452: J.

Chartier, _Journal du siege_, _Chronique de la Pucelle_.\r\nCamusat, _Mel. hist._, part ii, fol. 214.]\r\n\r\nJean Laiguise was the spokesman. He came to do homage to the King and\r\nto offer excuse for the townsfolk.\r\n\r\nIt is not their fault, he said, if the King enter not according to his\r\ngood pleasure. The Bailie and those of the garrison, some three or\r\nfour hundred, guard the gates, and forbid their being opened. Let it\r\nplease the King to have patience until I have spoken to those of the\r\ntown. I trust that as soon as I have spoken to them, they will open\r\nthe gates and render the King such obedience as he shall be pleased\r\nwithal.[1453]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1453: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in _Revue\r\nhistorique_, vol. iv, p. 342. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, _Journal du\r\nsiege_, Chartier, _loc. cit._ Gilles de Roye in Chartier, vol. iii, p.\r\n205.]\r\n\r\nIn replying to the Bishop, the King set forth the reasons for the\r\nexpedition and the rights he held over the town of Troyes.\r\n\r\nWithout exception, he said, I will forgive all the deeds of past\r\ntimes, and, according to the example of Saint Louis,[1454] I will\r\nmaintain the people of Troyes in peace and liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1454: J. Rogier in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 296.]\r\n\r\nJean Laiguise demanded that such revenues and patronage as had been\r\nbestowed on churchmen by the late King, Charles VI, should be retained\r\nby them, and that those who had received the same from King Henry of\r\nEngland should be given charters by King Charles authorizing them to\r\nkeep their benefices, even in cases where the King had bestowed them\r\non others.\r\n\r\nThe King consented and the Lord Bishop beheld in him a new Cyrus. This\r\nconference he reported to the Council of the Town. Thereupon it\r\ndeliberated and resolved to render allegiance to the King, in\r\nconsideration of his legal right and provided he would grant an\r\namnesty for all offences, would leave no garrison in the city and\r\nwould abolish all aids, save the _gabelle_.[1455] Whereupon the\r\nCouncil sent letters to the citizens of Reims making known to them\r\nthis resolution and exhorting them to take a similar one:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1455: _Gabelle_, word of German origin (_gabe_), originally\r\napplied to all taxes, came to signify only the tax on salt. This tax\r\nwas first rendered oppressive by Philippe de Valois (1328-1350) who\r\ncreated a monopoly of salt in favour of the crown. He obliged each\r\nfamily to pay a tax on a certain quantity whether they consumed it or\r\nnot. The _Gabelle_, which led to several rebellions, was not abolished\r\nuntil the Revolution (1790).

You will keep\r\nyour lives and your goods, as we have done. For otherwise we should\r\nall be lost. We do not regret our submission. Our only grief is that\r\nwe delayed so long. You will be right glad to follow our example; for\r\nKing Charles is a prince of greater discretion, understanding and\r\nvalour than any who for many a long year have arisen in the noble\r\nhouse of France.\"[1456]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1456: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 295, 296.]\r\n\r\nFriar Richard went to find the Maid. As soon as he saw her, and when\r\nhe was still afar off, he knelt before her. When she saw him, she\r\nlikewise knelt before him, and they bowed low to each other. When he\r\nreturned to the town, the good Friar preached to the folks at length\r\nand exhorted them to obey King Charles. \"God is preparing his way,\" he\r\nsaid. \"To accompany him and to lead him to his anointing God hath sent\r\nhim a holy Maid, who, as I firmly believe, is as able to penetrate the\r\nmysteries of God as any saint in Paradise, save Saint John the\r\nEvangelist.\"[1457] The good Brother found himself obliged to recognise\r\nas superior to Jeanne at least one saint,--one who was the first of\r\nsaints, the apostle who had lain with his head on Jesus' breast, the\r\nprophet who was ere long to return to earth, when the ages should have\r\nbeen consummated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1457: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in _Revue\r\nhistorique_, vol. iv, p. 342.]\r\n\r\n\"If she wished,\" continued Friar Richard, \"she could bring in all the\r\nKing's men-at-arms, over the walls or in any other manner that pleased\r\nher. And many other things can she do.\"\r\n\r\nThe townsfolk had great faith and confidence in this good Brother who\r\nspoke so eloquently. What he said of the Maid appeared to them\r\nadmirable, and won their obedience to a king so powerfully\r\naccompanied. With one voice they all cried aloud, \"Long live King\r\nCharles of France!\"[1458]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1458: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, in _Revue\r\nhistorique_, vol. iv, p. 342.]\r\n\r\nBut now it was necessary to treat with the Bailie. He was not\r\nunapproachable, seeing that he had suffered this going and coming from\r\nthe town to the camp and the camp to the town; and with him must be\r\ndevised some honest means of getting rid of the garrison. With this\r\nobject the commonalty, preceded by the Lord Bishop, went in great\r\nnumbers to the Bailie and the Captains, and called upon them to\r\nprovide for the safety of the town.[1459] This demand they were\r\nincapable of granting, for to safeguard a city against its will and to\r\ndrive out thirty thousand French was beyond their power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1459: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 296, 297.]\r\n\r\nAs the townsfolk had anticipated, the Bailie was greatly embarrassed.\r\nBeholding his perplexity, the Councillors of the town said to him, \"If\r\nyou will not keep the treaty you have made for the public weal, then\r\nwill we bring the King's men into the city, whether you will or no.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bailie and the Captains refused to betray their English and\r\nBurgundian masters, but they consented to go. That was all that was\r\nrequired of them.[1460]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1460: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 13, 117; vol. iv, pp. 296, 297.\r\nJean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. iii, p. 205. Th.

Assier, _Une cite champenoise au XV'e\r\nsiecle_, Paris, 1875, in 12mo, pp. 16, 17.]\r\n\r\nThe town opened its gates to Charles. On Sunday, the 10th of July,\r\nvery early in the morning, the Maid entered first into Troyes and\r\nwith her the common folk whom she so dearly loved. Friar Richard\r\naccompanied her. She posted archers along the streets which the\r\nprocession was to follow, so that the King of France should pass\r\nthrough the town between a double row of those foot soldiers of his\r\narmy who had so nobly aided him.[1461]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1461: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 102. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n319.]\r\n\r\nWhile Charles of Valois was entering by one gate, the Burgundian\r\ngarrison was going out by the other.[1462] As had been agreed, the men\r\nof King Henry and Duke Philip bore away their arms and other\r\npossessions. Now, in their possessions they included such French\r\nprisoners as they were holding to ransom. And, according to the use\r\nand custom of war, it would seem that they were not altogether wrong;\r\nbut pitiful it was to see King Charles's men led away captive just as\r\ntheir lord was arriving. The Maid heard of it, and her kind heart was\r\ntouched. She hurried to the gate of the town, where with arms and\r\nbaggage the fighting men were assembled. She found there the lords of\r\nRochefort and Philibert de Moslant. She challenged them and called to\r\nthem to leave the Dauphin's men. But the Captains thought otherwise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1462: Chartier, _Journal du siege_. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 319.]\r\n\r\n\"Thus to proceed against the treaty is fraudulent and wicked,\" they\r\nsaid to her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the prisoners on their knees were entreating the Saint to\r\nkeep them.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name,\" she cried, \"they shall not go.\"[1463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1463: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 95, 96.\r\n_Journal du siege_, p. 112. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 319.]\r\n\r\nDuring this altercation there was standing apart a certain Burgundian\r\nsquire, and through his mind were passing concerning the Maid of the\r\nArmagnacs certain reflections to which he was to give utterance\r\nlater. \"By my faith,\" he was thinking, \"it is the simplest creature\r\nthat ever I saw. There is neither rhyme nor reason in her, no more\r\nthan in the greatest stupid. To so valiant a woman as Madame d'Or, I\r\nwill not compare her, and the Burgundians do but jest when they appear\r\nafraid of her.\"[1464]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1464: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 296, 297.]\r\n\r\nTo taste the full flavour of this joke it must be explained that\r\nMadame d'Or, about as high as one's boot, held the office of fool to\r\nmy Lord Philip.[1465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1465: Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol. ii, p. 168. S. Luce,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. clxxiii, clxxiv. P. Champion, _Notes sur\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, I. _Madame d'Or et Jeanne d'Arc_ in _Le moyen age_,\r\nJuly to August, 1907, pp. 193-199.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid failed to come to an understanding with the Lords de\r\nRochefort and de Moslant concerning the prisoners. They had right on\r\ntheir side. She had only the promptings of her kind heart. This\r\ndiscussion afforded great entertainment to the men-at-arms of both\r\nparties. When King Charles was informed of it, he smiled and said that\r\nto settle the dispute he would pay the prisoners' ransom, which was\r\nfixed at one silver mark per head. On receiving this sum the\r\nBurgundians extolled the generosity of the King of France.[1466]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1466: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 319.

He had put on his festive robes, gleaming with\r\nvelvet, with gold, and with precious stones. The Duke of Alencon and\r\nthe Maid, holding her banner in her hand, rode at his side. He was\r\nfollowed by all the knighthood. The townsfolk lit bonfires and danced\r\nin rings. The little children cried, \"Noel!\" Friar Richard\r\npreached.[1467]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1467: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 102.

Boutiot, _Histoire de la ville de Troyes_, vol. ii,\r\npp. 504 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe Maid prayed in the churches. In one church she held a babe over\r\nthe baptismal font. Like a princess or a holy woman, she was\r\nfrequently asked to be godmother to children she did not know and was\r\nnever to see again. She generally named the children Charles in honour\r\nof the King, and to the girls she gave her own name of Jeanne.\r\nSometimes she called the children by names chosen by their\r\nmothers.[1468]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1468: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the 11th of July, the army, which had remained outside\r\nthe walls, under the command of Messire Ambroise de Lore, passed\r\nthrough the town. The entrance of men-at-arms was a scourge, of which\r\nthe citizens were as much afraid as of the Black Death.[1469] King\r\nCharles, being careful to spare the citizens, took measures to control\r\nthis scourge. By his command the heralds cried that under pain of\r\nhanging no soldier must enter the houses or take anything against the\r\nwill of the townsfolk.[1470]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1469: T.

From Lettree the King\r\nsent his herald Montjoie to the people of Chalons to ask them to\r\nreceive him and render him obedience.[1471]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1471: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 298.

When the Dauphin was at Brinion-l'Archeveque, the people of\r\nChalons had heard of it from their friends of Troyes. The latter had\r\neven told them that Friar Richard, the preacher, had brought them a\r\nletter from Jeanne the Maid. Whereupon the folk of Chalons wrote to\r\nthose of Reims:\r\n\r\n\"We are amazed at Friar Richard. We esteemed him a man right worthy.\r\nBut he has turned sorcerer. We announce unto you that the citizens of\r\nTroyes are making war against the Dauphin's men. We are resolved to\r\nresist the enemy with all our strength.\"[1472]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1472: J.

But it was important to\r\ndisplay great loyalty to the Duke of Burgundy before receiving another\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThe Count Bishop of Chalons came out to Lettree to meet the King and\r\ngave up to him the keys of the town. He was Jean de Montbeliard-Saarbrueck,\r\none of the Sires of Commercy.[1473]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1473: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. v, col. 891-895. _Chronique\r\nde la Pucelle_, pp. 319-320.

Morosini, vol. iii, p. 182, note 2.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July the King and his army entered the town of\r\nChalons.[1474] There the Maid found four or five peasants from her\r\nvillage come to see her, and with them Jean Morel, who was her\r\nkinsman. By calling a husbandman, and about forty-three years of age,\r\nhe had fled with the d'Arc family to Neufchateau on the passing of the\r\nmen-at-arms. Jeanne gave him a red gown which she had worn.[1475] At\r\nChalons also she met another husbandman, younger than Morel by about\r\nten years, Gerardin from Epinal, whom she called her _compeer_,[1476]\r\njust as she called Gerardin's wife Isabellette her _commere_[1477]\r\nbecause she had held their son Nicolas over the baptismal font and\r\nbecause a godmother is a mother in the spirit. At home in the village\r\nJeanne mistrusted Gerardin because he was a Burgundian. At Chalons she\r\nshowed more confidence in him and talked to him of the progress of the\r\narmy, saying that she feared nothing except treason.[1478] Already she\r\nhad dark forebodings; doubtless she felt that henceforth the frankness\r\nof her soul and the simplicity of her mind would be hardly assailed by\r\nthe wickedness of men and the confusing forces of circumstance.\r\nAlready the words of Saint Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret\r\nhad lost some of their primitive clearness, for they had come to treat\r\nof those French and Burgundian state secrets which were not heavenly\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1474: J.

In this\r\nletter they said they had found King Charles kind, gracious, pitiful,\r\nand merciful; and of a truth the King was dealing leniently with the\r\ntowns of Champagne. The people of Chalons added that he had a great\r\nmind and a fine bearing.[1479] That was saying much.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1479: \"In as much as he is the prince of the greatest\r\ndiscretion, understanding, and valour that has long been seen in the\r\nnoble house of France.\" J.

Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\na Reims_, pp. 13 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Reims acted with extreme caution. On the arrival of\r\nthe King of France in the neighbourhood of the town, while they sent\r\ninforming him that their gates should be opened to him, to their Lord\r\nPhilip and likewise to the Burgundians and English captains, they sent\r\nword of the progress of the royal army as far as they knew it, and\r\ncalled upon them to oppose the enemy's march.[1480] But they were in\r\nno hurry to obtain succour, reckoning that, should they receive none,\r\nthey could surrender to King Charles without incurring any censure\r\nfrom the Burgundians, and that thus they would have nothing to fear\r\nfrom either party. For the moment they preserved their loyalty to the\r\ntwo sides, which was wise in circumstances so difficult and so\r\ndangerous. While observing the craft with which these towns of\r\nChampagne practised the art of changing masters, it is well to\r\nremember that their lives and possessions depended on their knowledge\r\nof that art.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1480: J. Rogier, _loc. cit._ Varin, p. 599.]\r\n\r\nAs early as the 1st of July Captain Philibert de Moslant wrote to them\r\nfrom Nogent-sur-Seine, where he was with his Burgundian company, that\r\nif they needed him he would come to their help like a good\r\nChristian.[1481] They feigned not to understand. After all, the Lord\r\nPhilibert was not their captain. What he proposed to do was, as he\r\nsaid, only out of Christian charity. The notables of Reims, who did\r\nnot wish for deliverance, had to beware, above all, of their natural\r\ndeliverer, the Sire de Chastillon, Grand Steward of France, the\r\ncommander of the town.[1482] And they must needs request help in such\r\na manner as not to obtain their request, for fear of being like the\r\nIsraelites, of whom it is written: _Et tribuit eis petitionem eorum_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1481: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 286 _et seq._\r\nVarin, pp. 600 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1482: H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, p. 18. Dom Marlot,\r\n_Hist. metrop. Remensis_, vol. ii, pp. 709 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nWhen the royal army was yet before the walls of Troyes, a herald\r\nappeared at the gates of Reims, bearing a letter given by the King, at\r\nBrinion-l'Archeveque, on Monday, the 4th of July. This letter was\r\ndelivered to the Council. \"You may have heard tidings,\" said the King\r\nto his good people of Reims, \"of the success and victory it hath\r\npleased God to vouchsafe unto us over our ancient enemies, the\r\nEnglish, before the town of Orleans and since then at Jargeau,\r\nBeaugency, and Meung-sur-Loire, in each of which places our enemies\r\nhave received grievous hurt; all their leaders and others to the\r\nnumber of four thousand have been slain or taken prisoners. Such\r\nthings having happened, more by divine grace than human skill, we,\r\naccording to the advice of our Princes of the Blood and the members of\r\nour Great Council, are coming to the town of Reims to receive our\r\nanointing and coronation. Wherefore we summon you, on the loyalty and\r\nobedience you owe us, to dispose yourselves to receive us in the\r\naccustomed manner as you have done for our predecessors.\"[1483]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1483: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 291-292.]\r\n\r\nAnd King Charles, adopting towards the citizens of Reims that same\r\nwise benignity he had shown to the citizens of Troyes, promised them\r\nfull pardon and oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Be not deterred,\" he said, \"by matters that are past and the fear\r\nthat we may remember them. Be assured that if now ye act towards us as\r\nye ought, ye shall be dealt with as becometh good and loyal subjects.\"\r\n\r\nHe even asked them to send notables to treat with him. \"If, in order\r\nto be better informed concerning our intentions, certain citizens of\r\nReims would come to us with the herald, whom we send, we should be\r\nwell pleased. They may come in safety and in such numbers as shall\r\nseem good to them.\"[1484]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1484: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 291.]\r\n\r\nOn the delivery of this letter the Council was convoked, but it so\r\nbefell that there were not enough aldermen to deliberate; hence the\r\nCouncil was relieved from a serious embarrassment. Whereupon the\r\ncommon folk were assembled in the various quarters of the city, and\r\nfrom the citizens thus consulted was obtained the following crafty\r\ndeclaration: \"It is our intention to live and die with the Council and\r\nthe Notables. According to their advice we shall act in concord and in\r\npeace, without murmuring or making answer, unless it be by the counsel\r\nand decree of the Commander of Reims and his Lieutenant.\"[1485]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1485: _Ibid._, p. 292. H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_,\r\npp. 17 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe Sire de Chastillon, Commander of the town, was then at\r\nChateau-Thierry with his lieutenants, Jean Cauchon and Thomas de\r\nBazoches, both of them knights. The citizens of Reims deemed it wise\r\nthat he should see King Charles's letter. Their Bailie, Guillaume\r\nHodierne, went to the Lord Captain and showed it to him. Most\r\nfaithfully did the Bailie express the sentiments of the people of\r\nReims: he asked the Sire de Chastillon to come to their deliverance,\r\nbut he asked in such a manner that he did not come. That was the\r\nall-important point; for by not appealing to him they laid themselves\r\nopen to a charge of treason, while if he did come they risked having\r\nto endure a siege grievous and dangerous.\r\n\r\nWith this object the Bailie declared that the citizens of Reims,\r\ndesirous to communicate with their captains, were willing to receive\r\nhim if he were accompanied by no more than fifty horse. Herein they\r\ndisplayed their good will, being entitled to refuse to receive a\r\ngarrison within their walls; this privilege notwithstanding, they\r\nconsented to admit fifty horse, which meant about two hundred fighting\r\nmen. As the citizens had foreseen, the Sire de Chastillon judged such\r\na number insufficient for his safety. He demanded as the conditions of\r\nhis coming, that the town should be victualled and put in a state of\r\ndefence, that he should enter it with three or four hundred\r\ncombatants, that the defence of the city as well as of the castle\r\nshould be entrusted to him, and that there should be delivered up to\r\nhim five or six notables as hostages. On these conditions he declared\r\nhimself ready to live and die for them.[1486]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1486: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 292, 293. Varin,\r\n_Archives de Reims_, pp. 910, 912. H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_,\r\np. 18.]\r\n\r\nHe marched with his company to within a short distance of the town,\r\nand then made known to the townsfolk that he had come to succour\r\nthem.[1487]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1487: J. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 295. H. Jadart,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, pp. 18, 19.]\r\n\r\nThe English were indeed recruiting troops wherever they could and\r\npressing all manner of folk into their service. They were said to be\r\narming even priests; and the Regent was certainly pressing into his\r\nservice the crusaders disembarked in France, whom the Cardinal of\r\nWinchester was intending to lead against the Hussites.[1488] As we may\r\nimagine, King Henry's Council did not fail to inform the inhabitants\r\nof Reims of the armaments which were being assembled. On the 3rd of\r\nJuly they were told that the troops were crossing the sea, and on the\r\n10th Colard de Mailly, Bailie of Vermandois, announced that they had\r\nlanded. But these tidings failed to inspire the folk of Champagne with\r\nany great confidence in the power of the English. While the Sire de\r\nChastillon was promising that in forty days they should have a fine\r\nlarge army from beyond the seas, King Charles with thirty thousand\r\ncombatants was but a few miles from their gates. The Sire de\r\nChastillon perceived, what he had previously suspected, that he was\r\ntricked. The citizens of Reims refused to admit him. Nothing remained\r\nfor him but to turn round and join the English.[1489]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1488: Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 451.

L. Paris, _Cabinet historique_, 1865,\r\np. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe Council of the city having assembled on that day, the clerk\r\nproceeded to draw up an official report of its deliberations:\r\n\r\n\"... After having represented to my Lord of Chastillon that he is the\r\nCommander and that the lords and the mass of the people who....\"[1491]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1491: H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nHe wrote no more. Finding it difficult to protest their loyalty to the\r\nEnglish while making ready King Charles's coronation, and considering\r\nit imprudent to recognize a new prince without being forced to it, the\r\ncitizens abruptly renounced the silver of speech and took refuge in\r\nthe gold of silence.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 16th, King Charles took up his quarters in the\r\nCastle of Sept-Saulx, ten miles from the city where he was to be\r\ncrowned. This fortress had been erected two hundred years before by\r\nthe warlike predecessors of my Lord Regnault. Its proud keep commanded\r\nthe crossing of the Vesle.[1492] There the King received the citizens\r\nof Reims, who came in great numbers to do him homage.[1493] Then, with\r\nthe Maid and his whole army, he resumed his march. Having traversed\r\nthe last stage of the highroad which wound along the bank of the\r\nVesle, he entered the great city of Champagne at nightfall. The\r\nsouthern gate, called Dieulimire, lowered its drawbridge and raised\r\nits two portcullises to let him pass.[1494]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1492: Perceval de Cagny, p. 159.

Their horror of receiving and maintaining men-at-arms within\r\ntheir gates they shared with the citizens of all towns, who in their\r\npanic were incapable of distinguishing Armagnac soldiers from English\r\nand Burgundians. Wherefore in all things were they diligent, but with\r\nthe firm intention of paying as little as possible. Seeing that to\r\nthem the coronation brought neither profit nor honour, the aldermen\r\nwere accustomed to throw the burden of it on the Archbishop, who, they\r\nsaid, as peer of France,[1498] would receive the emoluments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1495: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 322, 323, note. \"This\r\nritual dates back certainly as far as the 13th century.

The crown of Charlemagne, brilliant with rubies,\r\nsapphires and emeralds, adorned with four flowers-de-luce, which the\r\nKings of France received on their coronation, the English wished to\r\nplace on the head of their King Henry. This child King they were\r\npreparing to gird with the sword of Charlemagne, the illustrious\r\nJoyeuse, which in its sheath of violet velvet slept in the keeping of\r\nthe Burgundian Abbot of Saint-Denys. In English hands likewise were\r\nthe sceptre surmounted by a golden Charlemagne in imperial robes, the\r\nrod of justice terminated by a hand in horn of unicorn, the golden\r\nclasp of Saint Louis' mantle, and the golden spurs and the Pontifical,\r\ncontaining within its enamelled binding of silver-gilt the ceremonial\r\nof the coronation.[1499] The French must needs make shift with a crown\r\nkept in the sacristy of the cathedral.[1500] The other signs of\r\nroyalty handed down from Clovis, from Saint Charlemagne and Saint\r\nLouis must be represented as well as could be. After all, it was not\r\nunfitting that this coronation, won by a single expedition, should be\r\nexpressive of the labour and suffering it had cost. It was well that\r\nthe ceremony should suggest something of the heroic poverty of the\r\nmen-at-arms and the common folk who had brought the Dauphin thither.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1499: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 322, note 1.

It was enclosed in a reliquary in the form of a\r\ndove, because the Holy Ghost in the semblance of a dove had been seen\r\ndescending with the oil for the anointing of the first Christian\r\nKing.[1502] Of a truth in ancient books it was written that an angel\r\nhad come down from heaven with the miraculous ampulla,[1503] but men\r\nwere not disturbed by such inconsistencies, and among Christian folk\r\nno one doubted that the sacred chrism was possessed of miraculous\r\npower. For example, it was known that with use the oil became no less,\r\nthat the flask remained always full, as a premonition and a pledge\r\nthat the kingdom of France would endure for ever.

In their places came the Duke of Alencon,\r\nthe Counts of Clermont and of Vendome, the Sires de Laval, de La\r\nTremouille, and de Maille.\r\n\r\nOf the six ecclesiastical peers, three replied to the summons of the\r\nking-at-arms,--the Archbishop Duke of Reims, the Bishop Count of\r\nChalons, the Bishop Duke of Laon. For the missing bishops of Langres\r\nand Noyon were substituted those of Seez and Orleans. In the absence\r\nof Arthur of Brittany, Constable of France, the sword was held by\r\nCharles, Sire d'Albret.[1505]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1505: Letters from three noblemen of Anjou, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, pp. 127, 129.

He swore, first, to maintain the peace and\r\nprivileges of the Church; second, to preserve his people from\r\nexactions and not to burden them too heavily; third, to govern with\r\njustice and mercy.[1506]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1506: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 322, note 1.]\r\n\r\nFrom his cousin d'Alencon he received the arms of a knight.[1507] Then\r\nthe Archbishop anointed him with the holy oil, with which the Holy\r\nGhost makes strong priests, kings, prophets and martyrs. So this new\r\nSamuel consecrated the new Saul, making manifest that all power is of\r\nGod, and that, according to the example set by David, kings are\r\npontiffs, the ministers and the witnesses of the Lord. This pouring\r\nout of the oil, with which the Kings of Israel were anointed, had\r\nrendered the kings of most Christian France burning and shining lights\r\nsince the time of Charlemagne, yea, even since the days of Clovis; for\r\nthough it was baptism and confirmation rather than anointing that\r\nClovis received at the hands of the Blessed Saint Remi, yet he was\r\nanointed Christian and King by the blessed bishop, and at the same\r\ntime and with that same holy oil which God himself had sent to this\r\nprince and to his successors.[1508]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1507: Perceval de Cagny, p. 159. _Journal du siege_, p. 114.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 322.

Her white banner, before which the\r\nancient standard of Chandos had retreated, she held for a moment\r\nunfurled. Then others in their turn held her standard, her page Louis\r\nde Coutes, who never left her, and Friar Richard the preacher, who had\r\nfollowed her to Chalons and to Reims.[1511] In one of her dreams she\r\nhad lately given a crown to the King; she was looking for this crown\r\nto be brought into the church by heavenly messengers.[1512] Did not\r\nsaints commonly receive crowns from angels' hands? To Saint Cecilia an\r\nangel offered a crown with garlands of roses and lilies. To\r\nCatherine, the Virgin, an angel gave an imperishable crown, which she\r\nplaced upon the head of the Empress of Rome. But the crown curiously\r\nrich and magnificent that Jeanne looked for came not.[1513]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1510: Letter from three noblemen of Anjou, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, p. 129. F.

To the Chapter he presented\r\nhangings of green satin as well as ornaments of red velvet and white\r\ndamask. Moreover, he placed upon the altar a silver vase with thirteen\r\ngolden crowns. Regardless of the claims asserted by the canons, the\r\nLord Archbishop took possession of it, but it profited him little,\r\nfor he had to give it up.[1517] After the ceremony King Charles put\r\nthe crown on his head and over his shoulders the royal mantle, blue as\r\nthe sky, flowered with lilies of gold; and on his charger he passed\r\ndown the streets of Reims city. The people in great joy cried, \"Noel!\"\r\nas they had cried when my Lord the Duke of Burgundy entered. On that\r\nday the Sire de Rais was made marshal of France and the Sire de la\r\nTremouille count. The eldest of Madame de Laval's two sons, he to whom\r\nthe Maid had offered wine at Selles-en-Berry, was likewise made count.\r\nCaptain La Hire received the county of Longueville with such parts of\r\nNormandy as he could conquer.[1518]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1517: Dom Marlot, _Histoire de la ville de Reims_, vol. iv,\r\np. 175.

It was a day of\r\nfree drinking and fraternity. In the houses, at the doors, by the\r\nwayside, folk made good cheer, and the kitchens were busy; there were\r\nthat day consumed oxen in dozens, sheep in hundreds, chicken and\r\nrabbits in thousands. Folk stuffed themselves with spices, and (for it\r\nwas a thirsty day) they quaffed full many a beaker of wine of\r\nBurgundy, and especially of that wine of delicate flavour that comes\r\nfrom Beaune. At every coronation the ancient stag, made of bronze and\r\nhollow, which stood in the courtyard of the archiepiscopal palace was\r\ncarried into the Rue du Parvis; it was filled with wine and the people\r\ndrank from it as from a fountain. Finally the burgesses and all the\r\ninhabitants of Blessed Saint Remi's city, rich and poor alike, stuffed\r\nand satiated with good wine, having howled \"Noel!\" till they were\r\nhoarse, fell asleep over the wine-casks and the victuals, the remains\r\nof which were to be a cause of bitter dispute between the grim\r\naldermen and the King's men on the morrow.[1520]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1519: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 339.

He lodged at the Sign of _L'Ane Raye_ in\r\nthe Rue du Parvis in a hostelry kept by Alix, widow of Raulin Morieau.\r\nAs well as his daughter, he saw once more his son Pierre.[1521] The\r\ncousin, whom Jeanne called uncle and who had accompanied her to\r\nVaucouleurs to Sire Robert, had likewise come hither to the\r\ncoronation. He spoke to the King and told him all he knew of his\r\ncousin.[1522] At Reims also Jeanne found her young fellow-countryman,\r\nHusson Le Maistre, coppersmith of the village of Varville, about seven\r\nmiles from Domremy. She did not know him; but he had heard tell of\r\nher, and he was very familiar with Jacques and Pierre d'Arc.[1523]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1521: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 198; vol. v, pp. 141, 266.

He had\r\ncome doubtless for himself and on behalf of his village to ask the\r\nKing for an exemption from taxation. This request, presented to the\r\nKing by the Maid, was granted. On the 31st of the month the King\r\ndecreed that the inhabitants of Greux and of Domremy should be free\r\nfrom all _tailles_, aids, subsidies, and subventions.[1525] Out of the\r\npublic funds the magistrates of the town paid Jacques d'Arc's\r\nexpenses, and when he was about to depart they gave him a horse to\r\ntake him home.[1526]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1524: S.

The poor and humble came to her; good\r\nwives took her by the hand and touched their rings with hers.[1527] On\r\nher finger she wore a little ring made of a kind of brass, sometimes\r\ncalled electrum.[1528] Electrum was said to be the gold of the poor.\r\nIn place of a stone the ring had a collet inscribed with the words\r\n\"Jhesus Maria\" with three crosses. Oftentimes she reverently fixed her\r\ngaze upon it, for once she had had it touched by Saint Catherine.[1529]\r\nAnd that the Saint should have actually touched it was not incredible,\r\nseeing that some years before, in 1413, Sister Colette, who was vowed\r\nto virginal chastity, had received from the Virgin apostle a rich\r\ngolden ring, as a sign of her spiritual marriage with the King of\r\nKings. Sister Colette permitted the nuns and monks of her order to\r\ntouch this ring, and she confided it to the messengers she sent to\r\ndistant lands to preserve them from perils by the way.[1530] The Maid\r\nascribed great powers to her ring, albeit she never used it to heal\r\nthe sick.[1531]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1527: _Ibid._, p. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1528: Du Cange, _Glossarium_, under the words _Auriacum_,\r\n_electrum_, and _leto_.

Before the\r\ncoronation ceremony the nobles and knights had been given gloves,\r\naccording to the custom. One of them lost his; he asked the Maid to\r\nfind them, or others asked her for him. She did not promise to do it;\r\nnotwithstanding the matter became known, and various interpretations\r\nwere placed upon it.[1532]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1532: _Ibid._, p. 104. H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, p.\r\n37.]\r\n\r\nAfter the King's coronation, jostled by the crowd in the Rue du\r\nParvis, one can imagine some thoughtful clerk raising his eyes to the\r\nglorious facade of the Cathedral, that Bible in stone, already\r\nappearing ancient to men, who, knowing naught of the chronicles,\r\nmeasured time by the span of human existence. Such a clerk would have\r\ncertainly beheld on the left of the pointed arch above the rose\r\nwindow the colossal image of Goliath rising proudly in his coat of\r\nmail, and that same figure repeated on the right of the arch in the\r\nattitude of a man tottering and ready to fall.[1533] Then this clerk\r\nmust have remembered what is written in the first book of Kings:[1534]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1533: \"These figures (Goliath and David) must have been\r\nsculptured at the end of the 13th century.\" (L. Demaison, _Notice\r\nhistorique sur la cathedrale de Reims_, s.d. in 4to, p. 44.) The date\r\nof the rose window is 1280 (H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, p.\r\n44).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1534: According to the Vulgate. First book of Samuel\r\naccording to the Authorized Version (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n\"And there went out a man base-born from the camp of the Philistines,\r\nnamed Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span. And he\r\nhad a helmet of brass upon his head and he was clothed with a coat of\r\nmail with scales; and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand\r\nsicles of brass. And standing he cried out to the bands of Israel and\r\nsaid to them: I bring reproach unto the armies of Israel. Choose out a\r\nman of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now David had gone to feed his Father's sheep at Bethlehem. But he\r\narose in the morning and gave the charge of the flock to the keeper.\r\nAnd he came to the place of Magala and to the army which was going out\r\nto fight. And, seeing Goliath, he asked: 'Who is this uncircumcised\r\nPhilistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?'\r\n\r\n\"And the words which David spoke, were rehearsed before Saul; and he\r\nsent for him. David said to Saul, 'Let not any man's heart be dismayed\r\nin him; I, thy servant, will go and fight against this Philistine.'\r\nAnd Saul said to David 'Thou art not able to withstand this Philistine\r\nnor to fight against him; for thou art but a boy, but he is a warrior\r\nfrom his youth.' And David made answer, 'I will go against him and I\r\nwill take away the reproach from Israel.' Then Saul said to David, 'Go\r\nand the Lord be with thee.'\r\n\r\n\"And David took his staff which he had always in his hands, and chose\r\nhim five smooth stones out of the brook, and he took a sling in his\r\nhand; and went forth against the Philistine.\r\n\r\n\"And when the Philistine looked and beheld David, he despised him. For\r\nhe was a young man, and ruddy, and of a comely countenance. And the\r\nPhilistine said to David: 'Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a\r\nstaff?' Then said David to the Philistine: 'Thou comest to me with a\r\nsword, and with a spear and with a shield: but I come to thee in the\r\nname of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which thou\r\nhast defied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand that\r\nall the earth may know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear:\r\nfor it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.'\r\n\r\n\"And when the Philistine arose and was coming and drew nigh to meet\r\nDavid, David made haste and ran to the fight to meet the Philistine.\r\nAnd he put his hand into his scrip and took a stone, and cast it with\r\nthe sling and fetching it about struck the Philistine in the forehead,\r\nand the stone was fixed in his forehead and he fell on his face upon\r\nthe earth.\"[1535]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1535: 1 Samuel xvii. Where the author quotes direct from the\r\nVulgate the translator has followed the Douai version (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nThen the clerk, meditating on these words of the Book, would reflect\r\nhow God, the Unchanging, who saved Israel and struck down Goliath by\r\nthe sling of a shepherd lad, had raised up the daughter of a\r\nhusbandman for the deliverance of the most Christian realm and the\r\nreproach of the Leopard.[1536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1536: See the coronation of David and that of Louis XII by\r\nan unknown painter, about 1498, in the Cluny Museum.

Having received no reply, on the day of the coronation she\r\ndictated a second letter to the Duke. Here it is:\r\n\r\n     [cross symbol] JHESUS MARIA\r\n\r\n     \"High and greatly to be feared Prince, Duke of Burgundy,\r\n     Jehanne the Maid, in the name of the King of Heaven, her\r\n     rightful and liege lord, requires you and the King of France\r\n     to make a good peace which shall long endure. Forgive one\r\n     another heartily and entirely as becometh good Christians;\r\n     an if it please you to make war, go ye against the Saracens.\r\n     Prince of Burgundy, I pray you, I entreat you, I beseech you\r\n     as humbly as lieth in my power, that ye make war no more\r\n     against the holy realm of France, and that forthwith and\r\n     speedily ye withdraw those your men who are in any\r\n     strongholds and fortresses of the said holy kingdom; and in\r\n     the name of the fair King of France, he is ready to make\r\n     peace with you, saving his honour if that be necessary. And\r\n     in the name of the King of Heaven, my Sovereign liege Lord,\r\n     for your good, your honour and your life, I make known unto\r\n     you, that ye will never win in battle against the loyal\r\n     French and that all they who wage war against the holy realm\r\n     of France, will be warring against King Jhesus, King of\r\n     Heaven and of the world, my lawful liege lord. And with\r\n     clasped hands I beseech and entreat you that ye make no\r\n     battle nor wage war against us, neither you, nor your\r\n     people, nor your subjects; and be assured that whatever\r\n     number of folk ye bring against us, they will gain nothing,\r\n     and it will be sore pity for the great battle and the blood\r\n     that shall be shed of those that come against us. And three\r\n     weeks past, I did write and send you letters by a herald,\r\n     that ye should come to the anointing of the King, which\r\n     to-day, Sunday, the 17th day of this present month, is made\r\n     in the city of Reims: to which letter I have had no answer,\r\n     neither news of the said herald. To God I commend you; may\r\n     he keep you, if it be his will; and I pray God to establish\r\n     good peace.

Albeit the Maid liked not the Burgundians, in her own way\r\nshe realized forcibly how desirable was peace with the Duke of\r\nBurgundy. With clasped hands she entreats him to cease making war\r\nagainst France. \"An it please you to make war then go ye against the\r\nSaracens.\" Already she had counselled the English to join the French\r\nand go on a crusade. The destruction of the infidel was then the dream\r\nof gentle peace-loving souls; and many pious folk believed that the\r\nson of the knight, who had been vanquished at Nicopolis, would make\r\nthe Turks pay dearly for their former victory.[1538]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1538: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 82, 83.

It was hoped that peace would be concluded\r\nbefore their departure. The Angevin lords announced it to their\r\nqueens, Yolande and Marie.[1541] By so doing they showed how little\r\nthey knew the consummate old fox of Dijon. The French were not strong\r\nenough yet, neither were the English weak enough. It was agreed that\r\nin August an embassy should be sent to the Duke of Burgundy in the\r\ntown of Arras. After four days negotiation, a truce for fifteen days\r\nwas signed and the embassy left Reims.[1542] At the same time, the\r\nDuke at Paris solemnly renewed his complaint against Charles of\r\nValois, his father's assassin, and undertook to bring an army to the\r\nhelp of the English.[1543]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1540: _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 514, 515.

The\r\nKing of France shared with him the power of healing scrofula; and as\r\nthe power came to him from the holy oil brought down from heaven by a\r\ndove, it was thought that this virtue would be more effectual at the\r\ntime of the anointing, all the more because by lewdness, disobedience\r\nto the Christian Church, and other irregularities, he stood in danger\r\nof losing it. That is what had happened to King Philippe I.[1547] The\r\nKings of England touched for the evil; notably King Edward III worked\r\nwondrous cures on scrofulous folk who were covered with scars. For\r\nthese reasons scrofula was called Saint Marcoul's evil or King's evil.\r\nVirgins as well as kings could cure this royal malady.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1546: _Gallia Christ_: ix, pp, 239, 51 [Transcriber's Note:\r\nso in original; does not match other citations to this work].

In those days\r\nit was quite impossible to form any clear idea of how things came\r\nabout. At Orleans, doubtless, there were certain who were keen enough\r\nto perceive that the numerous and ingenious engines of war, gathered\r\ntogether by the magistrates, had been of great service; but folk\r\ngenerally prefer to ascribe results to miraculous causes, and the\r\nmerit of their deliverance the people of Orleans attributed first to\r\ntheir Blessed Patrons, Saint Aignan and Saint Euverte, and after them\r\nto Jeanne, the Divine Maid, believing that there was no easier,\r\nsimpler, or more natural explanation of the deeds they had\r\nwitnessed.[1550]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1550: _Journal du siege_, pp. 16, 88. _Chronique de\r\nl'etablissement de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 296. Lottin,\r\n_Recits historiques sur Orleans_, vol. i, p. 279.]\r\n\r\nGuillaume Girault, former magistrate of the town and notary at the\r\nChatelet, wrote and signed, with his own hand, a brief account of the\r\ndeliverance of the city. Herein he states that on Wednesday, Ascension\r\nEve, the bastion of Saint-Loup was stormed and taken as if by miracle,\r\n\"there being present, and aiding in the fight, Jeanne the Maid, sent\r\nof God;\" and that, on the following Saturday, the siege laid by the\r\nEnglish to Les Tourelles at the end of the bridge was raised by the\r\nmost obvious miracle since the Passion. And Guillaume Girault\r\ntestifies that the Maid led the enterprise.[1551] When eye-witnesses,\r\nparticipators in the deeds themselves, had no clear idea of events,\r\nwhat could those more remote from the scene of action think of them?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1551: _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 282, 283.]\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the French victories flew with astonishing\r\nrapidity.[1552] The brevity of authentic accounts was amply\r\nsupplemented by the eloquence of loquacious clerks and the popular\r\nimagination. The Loire campaign and the coronation expedition were\r\nscarcely known at first save by fabulous reports, and the people only\r\nthought of them as supernatural events.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1552: Tidings of the Deliverance of Orleans sent from Bruges\r\nto Venice the 10th of May (Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 23, 24).]\r\n\r\nIn the letters sent by royal secretaries to the towns of the realm and\r\nthe princes of Christendom, the name of Jeanne the Maid was associated\r\nwith all the deeds of prowess. Jeanne herself, by her monastic scribe,\r\nmade known to all the great deeds which, it was her firm belief, she\r\nhad accomplished.[1553]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1553: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 123, 139, 145, 147, 156, 159,\r\n161.]\r\n\r\nIt was believed that everything had been done through her, that the\r\nKing had consulted her in all things, when in truth the King's\r\ncounsellors and the Captains rarely asked her advice, listened to it\r\nbut seldom, and brought her forth only at convenient seasons.\r\nEverything was attributed to her alone. Her personality, associated\r\nwith deeds attested and seemingly marvellous, became buried in a vast\r\ncycle of astonishing fables and disappeared in a forest of heroic\r\nstories.[1554]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1554: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 60, 61.]\r\n\r\nContrite souls there were in those days, who, ascribing all the woes\r\nof the kingdom to the sins of the people, looked for salvation to\r\nhumility, repentance, and penance.[1555] They expected the end of\r\niniquity and the kingdom of God on earth. Jeanne, at least in the\r\nbeginning, was one of those pious folk. Sometimes, speaking as a\r\nmystic reformer, she would say that Jesus is King of the holy realm of\r\nFrance, that King Charles is his lieutenant, and does but hold the\r\nkingdom \"in fief.\"[1556] She uttered words which would create the\r\nimpression that her mission was all charity, peace, and love,--these,\r\nfor example, \"I am sent to comfort the poor and needy.\"[1557] Such\r\ngentle penitents as dreamed of a world pure, faithful, and good, made\r\nof Jeanne their saint and their prophetess. They ascribed to her\r\nedifying words she had never uttered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1555: Saint Vincent Ferrier; and Saint Bernardino of Siena.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1556: See _ante_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1557: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 88.]\r\n\r\n\"When the Maid came to the King,\" they said, \"she caused him to make\r\nthree promises: the first was to resign his kingdom, to renounce it\r\nand give it back to God, from whom he held it; the second, to pardon\r\nall such as had turned against him and afflicted him; the third, to\r\nhumiliate himself so far as to receive into favour all such as should\r\ncome to him, poor and rich, friend and foe.\"[1558]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1558: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 52-53. See _ante_, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nOr again, in apologues, simple and charming, like the following, they\r\nrepresented her accomplishing her mission:\r\n\r\n\"One day, the Maid asked the King to bestow a present upon her; and\r\nwhen he consented, she claimed as a gift the realm of France. Though\r\nastonished, the King did not withdraw his promise. Having received\r\nher present, the Maid required a deed of gift to be solemnly drawn up\r\nby four of the King's notaries and read aloud. While the King listened\r\nto the reading, she pointed him out to those that stood by, saying:\r\n'Behold the poorest knight in the kingdom.' Then, after a short time,\r\ndisposing of the realm of France, she gave it back to God. Thereafter,\r\nacting in God's name, she invested King Charles with it and commanded\r\nthat this solemn act of transmission should be recorded in\r\nwriting.\"[1559]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1559: L. Delisle, _Un nouveau temoignage relatif a la\r\nmission de Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_,\r\nvol. xlvi, p. 649. Le P. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant l'Eglise de son\r\ntemps_, pp. 57, 58.]\r\n\r\nIt was believed that Jeanne had prophesied that on Saint John the\r\nBaptist's Day, 1429, not an Englishman should be left in France.[1560]\r\nThese simple folk expected their saint's promises to be fulfilled on\r\nthe day she had fixed. They maintained that on the 23rd of June she\r\nhad entered the city of Rouen, and that on the morrow, Saint John the\r\nBaptist's day, the inhabitants of Paris had of their own accord,\r\nopened their gates to the King of France. In the month of July these\r\nstories were being told in Avignon.[1561] Reformers, numerous it would\r\nseem in France and throughout Christendom, believed that the Maid\r\nwould organise the English and French on monastic lines and make of\r\nthem one nation of pious beggars, one brotherhood of penitents.\r\nAccording to them, the following were the intentions of the two\r\nparties and the clauses of the treaty:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1560: Letter written by the agents of a town or of a prince\r\nof Germany, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1561: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 38, 46, 61.]\r\n\r\n\"King Charles of Valois bestows universal pardon and is willing to\r\nforget all wrongs. The English and French, having turned to\r\ncontrition and repentance, are endeavouring to conclude a good and\r\nbinding peace. The Maid herself has imposed conditions upon them.\r\nConforming to her will, the English and French for one year or for two\r\nwill wear a grey habit, with a little cross sewn upon it; on every\r\nFriday they will live on bread and water; they will dwell in unity\r\nwith their wives and will seek no other women. They promise God not to\r\nmake war except for the defense of their country.\"[1562]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1562: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 64, 65.]\r\n\r\nDuring the coronation campaign, nothing being known of the agreement\r\nbetween the King's men and the people of Auxerre, towards the end of\r\nJuly, it was related that the town having been taken by storm, four\r\nthousand five hundred citizens had been killed and likewise fifteen\r\nhundred men-at-arms, knights as well as squires belonging to the\r\nparties of Burgundy and Savoy. Among the nobles slain were mentioned\r\nHumbert Marechal, Lord of Varambon, and a very famous warrior, le Viau\r\nde Bar. Stories were told of treasons and massacres, horrible\r\nadventures in which the Maid was associated with that knave of hearts\r\nwho was already famous. She was said to have had twelve traitors\r\nbeheaded.[1563] Such tales were real romances of chivalry. Here is one\r\nof them:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1563: _Ibid._, pp. 144 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAbout two thousand English surrounded the King's camp, watching to see\r\nif they could do him some hurt. Then the Maid called Captain La Hire\r\nand said to him: \"Thou hast in thy time done great prowess, but to-day\r\nGod prepares for thee a deed greater than any thou hast yet performed.\r\nTake thy men and go to such and such a wood two leagues herefrom, and\r\nthere shalt thou find two thousand English, all lance in hand; them\r\nshalt thou take and slay.\"\r\n\r\nLa Hire went forth to the English and all were taken and slain as the\r\nMaid had said.[1564]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1564: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 150, 153.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the fairy-stories told of Jeanne to the joy of simple\r\nprimitive folk, who delighted in the idea of a maid slayer of giants\r\nand remover of mountains.\r\n\r\nThere was a rumour that after the sack of Auxerre, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy had been defeated and taken in a great battle, that the\r\nRegent was dead and that the Armagnacs had entered Paris.[1565]\r\nProdigies were said to have attended the capitulation of Troyes. On\r\nthe coming of the French, it was told how the townsfolk beheld from\r\ntheir ramparts a vast multitude of men-at-arms, some five or six\r\nthousand, each man holding a white pennon in his hand. On the\r\ndeparture of the French, they beheld them again, ranged but a bow-shot\r\nbehind King Charles. These knights with white pennons vanished when\r\nthe King had gone; for they were as miraculous as those white-scarfed\r\nknights, whom the Bretons had seen riding in the sky but shortly\r\nbefore.[1566]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1565: _Ibid._, pp. 166, 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1566: Fragment of a letter on the marvels in Poitou, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 121, 122. _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 343.]\r\n\r\nAll that the people of Orleans beheld when their siege was suddenly\r\nraised, all that Armagnac mendicants and the Dauphin's clerks related\r\nwas greedily received, accredited, and amplified. Three months after\r\nher coming to Chinon, Jeanne had her legend, which grew and increased\r\nand extended into Italy, Flanders, and Germany.[1567] In the summer of\r\n1429, this legend was already formed. All the scattered parts of what\r\nmay be described as the gospel of her childhood existed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1567: Morosini, vol. iii, p. 78, note 1. Eberhard Windecke,\r\n_passim_.

Letter from Jean Desch, Secretary of the town of Metz, _ibid._,\r\npp. 352, 355.]\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven Jeanne kept sheep; the wolves did not molest her\r\nflock; the birds of the field, when she called them, came and ate\r\nbread from her lap. The wicked had no power over her. No one beneath\r\nher roof need fear man's fraud or ill-will.[1568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1568: Letters from Perceval de Boulainvilliers to the Duke\r\nof Milan, in _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 114, 116.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is a Latin poet who is writing, the miracles attending\r\nJeanne's birth assume a Roman majesty and are clothed with the august\r\ndignity of ancient myths. Thus it is curious to find a humanist of\r\n1429 summoning the Italian muse to the cradle of Zabillet Romee's\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"The thunder rolled, the ocean shuddered, the earth shook, the heavens\r\nwere on fire, the universe rejoiced visibly; a strange transport\r\nmingled with fear moved the enraptured nations. They sing sweet verses\r\nand dance in harmonious motion at the sign of the salvation prepared\r\nfor the French people by this celestial birth.\"[1569]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1569: Anonymous poem on the coming of the Maid and the\r\nDeliverance of Orleans, _Trial_, vol. v, p. 27, line 70 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nMoreover an attempt was made to represent the wonders that had\r\nheralded the nativity of Jesus as having been repeated on the birth of\r\nJeanne. It was imagined that she was born on the night of the\r\nEpiphany. The shepherds of her village, moved by an indescribable joy,\r\nthe cause of which was unknown to them, hastened through the darkness\r\ntowards the marvellous mystery. The cocks, heralds of this new joy,\r\nsing at an unusual season and, flapping their wings, seem to prophesy\r\nfor two hours. Thus the child in her cradle had her adoration of the\r\nshepherds.[1570]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1570: \"_In nocte Epiphaniarum_,\" says the letter from\r\nPerceval de Boulainvilliers (_Trial_, vol. v, p. 116), that is, Jan.\r\n6. For centuries, even after the fourth century, the birth of our Lord\r\nwas celebrated on that day. In France it was the Feast of Kings and\r\nthen was sung the anthem: _Magi videntes stellam_.]\r\n\r\nOf her coming into France there was much to tell. It was related that\r\nin the Chateau of Chinon she had recognised the King, whom she had\r\nnever seen before, and had gone straight to him, although he was but\r\npoorly clad and surrounded by his baronage.[1571] It was said that she\r\nhad given the King a sign, that she had revealed a secret to him; and\r\nthat on the revelation of the secret, known to him alone, he had been\r\nilluminated with a heavenly joy. Concerning this interview at Chinon,\r\nwhile those present had little to say, the stories of many who were\r\nnot there were interminable.[1572]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1571: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 116, 192. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 273. _Journal du siege_, p. 47.

One day when Saint Catherine\r\nof Sienna was kneeling in the fuller's house, a dove as white as snow\r\nperched on the child's head.[1574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1573: _Journal du siege_, p. 294. _Chronique de\r\nl'etablissement de la fete_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 294.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1574: AA. SS., April 3rd. Didron, _Iconographie chretienne_,\r\npp. 438, 439. Alba Mignati, _Sainte Catherine de Sienne_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nA tale then in circulation is interesting as showing the idea which\r\nprevailed concerning the relations of the King and the Maid; it\r\nserves, likewise, as an example of the perversions to which the story\r\nof an actual fact is subject as it passes from mouth to mouth. Here is\r\nthe tale as it was gathered by a German merchant.\r\n\r\nOn a day, in a certain town, the Maid, hearing that the English were\r\nnear, went into the field; and straightway all the men-at-arms, who\r\nwere in the town, leapt to their steeds and followed her. Meanwhile,\r\nthe King, who was at dinner, learning that all were going forth in\r\ncompany with the Maid, had the gates of the town closed.\r\n\r\nThe Maid was told, and she replied without concern: \"Before the hour\r\nof nones, the King will have so great need of me, that he will follow\r\nme immediately, spurless, and barely staying to throw on his cloak.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus it came to pass. For the men-at-arms shut up in the town\r\nbesought the King to open the gates forthwith or they would break them\r\ndown. The gates were opened and all the fighting men hastened to the\r\nMaid, heedless of the King, who threw on his cloak and followed them.\r\n\r\nOn that day a great number of the English were slain.[1575]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1575: Eberhard Windecke, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the story which gives a very inaccurate representation of what\r\nhappened at Orleans on the 6th of May. The citizens hastened in crowds\r\nto the Burgundian Gate, resolved to cross the Loire and attack Les\r\nTourelles. Finding the gate closed, they threw themselves furiously on\r\nthe Sire de Gaucourt who was keeping it. The aged baron had the gate\r\nopened wide and said to them, \"Come, I will be your captain.\"[1576] In\r\nthe story the citizens have become men-at-arms, and it is not the Sire\r\nde Gaucourt but the King who maliciously closes the gates. But the\r\nKing gained nothing by it; and it is astonishing to find that so early\r\nthere had grown up in the minds of the people the idea that, far from\r\naiding the Maid to drive out the English, the King had put obstacles\r\nin her way and was always the last to follow her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1576: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 116, 117.]\r\n\r\nSeen through this chaos of stories more indistinct than the clouds in\r\na stormy sky, Jeanne appeared a wondrous marvel. She prophesied and\r\nmany of her prophecies had already been fulfilled. She had foretold\r\nthe deliverance of Orleans and Orleans had been delivered. She had\r\nprophesied that she would be wounded, and an arrow had pierced her\r\nabove the right breast. She had prophesied that she would take the\r\nKing to Reims, and the King had been crowned in that city. Other\r\nprophecies had she uttered touching the realm of France, to wit, the\r\ndeliverance of the Duke of Orleans, the entering into Paris, the\r\ndriving of the English from the holy kingdom, and their fulfilment was\r\nexpected.[1577]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1577: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 55, 84 _et seq._, 133, 174, 232,\r\n251, 252, 254, 331; vol. iii, pp. 99, 205, 254, 257, _passim_.\r\n_Journal du siege_, pp. 34, 44, 45, 48. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp.\r\n212, 295.

By God, an I had my way she should not be a maid long.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne prophesied and said \"Ha, thou takest God's name in vain,\r\nand thou art so near thy death!\"\r\n\r\nLess than an hour later the man fell into the water and was\r\ndrowned.[1579]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1579: Brother Pasquerel's evidence, in _Trial_, vol. iii, p.\r\n102.]\r\n\r\nStraightway this miracle was related in Latin verse.

Luillier and Brother Pasquerel, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 25, 108.]\r\n\r\nMany of these tales were obvious imitations of incidents in the lives\r\nof the saints, which were widely read in those days. A woman, who was\r\na heretic, pulled the cassock of Saint Ambrose, whereupon the blessed\r\nbishop said to her, \"Take heed lest one day thou be chastised of God.\"\r\nOn the morrow the woman died, and the Blessed Ambrose conducted her to\r\nthe grave.[1582]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1582: The _Golden Legend_. Life of Saint Ambrose.]\r\n\r\nA nun, who was then alive and who was to die in an odour of sanctity,\r\nSister Colette of Corbie, had met her Furtivolus and had punished him,\r\nbut less severely. On a day when she was praying in a church of\r\nCorbie, a stranger drew near and spoke to her libidinous words: \"May\r\nit please God,\" she said, \"to bring home to you the hideousness of the\r\nwords you have just uttered.\" The stranger in shame went to the door.\r\nBut an invisible hand arrested him on the threshold. Then he realised\r\nthe gravity of his sin; he asked pardon of the saint and was free to\r\nleave the church.[1583]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1583: Abbe J. Th. Bizouard, _Histoire de sainte Colette et\r\ndes clarisses en Franche-Comte, d'apres des documents inedits et des\r\ntraditions locales_, Paris, 1888, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nAfter the royal army had departed from Gien, the Maid was said to have\r\nprophesied that a great battle would be fought between Auxerre and\r\nReims.[1584] When such predictions were not fulfilled they were\r\nforgotten. Besides, it was admitted that true prophets might sometimes\r\nutter false prophecies. A subtle theologian distinguished between\r\nprophecies of predestination which are always fulfilled and those of\r\ncondemnation, which being conditioned, may not be fulfilled and that\r\nwithout reflecting untruthfulness on the lips that uttered them.[1585]\r\nFolk wondered that a peasant child should be able to forecast the\r\nfuture, and with the Apostle they cried, \"I praise thee, O Father,\r\nbecause thou hast hidden those things from the wise and prudent and\r\nrevealed them unto babes.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1584: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 148, 156.

The first part\r\nwas drawn up not later than July, 1429. The second is dated the 17th\r\nof September, the same year. This clerk believes that the Maid\r\npractised the art of divination by means of astrology. He had heard a\r\nFrench monk of the order of the Premonstratensians[1587] say that\r\nJeanne delighted to study the heavens by night. He observes that all\r\nher prophecies concerned the kingdom of France; and he gives the\r\nfollowing as having been uttered by the Maid: \"After having ruled for\r\ntwenty years, the Dauphin will sleep with his fathers. After him, his\r\neldest son, now a child of six, will reign more gloriously, more\r\nhonourably, more powerfully than any King of France since\r\nCharlemagne.\"[1588]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1586: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 138 _et seq._ Morosini, vol.\r\niii, pp. 62-63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1587: The monastery of the Premonstratensians, near Laon,\r\nwas founded in 1122, by St. Norbert (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1588: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 422 _et seq._, 433, 434, 465;\r\nvol. v, pp. 475, 476.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid possessed the gift of beholding events which were taking\r\nplace far away.\r\n\r\nAt Vaucouleurs, on the very day of the Battle of the Herrings, she\r\nknew the Dauphin's army had suffered grievous hurt.[1589]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1589: _Journal du siege_, p. 44. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 272.]\r\n\r\nOn a day when she was dining, seated near the King, she began to laugh\r\nquietly. The King, perceiving, asked her: \"My beloved, wherefore laugh\r\nye so merrily?\"\r\n\r\nShe made answer that she would tell him when the repast was over. And,\r\nwhen the ewer was brought her, \"Sire,\" she said, \"this day have been\r\ndrowned in the sea five hundred English, who were crossing to your\r\nland to do you hurt. Therefore did I laugh. In three days you will\r\nknow that it is true.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was.[1590]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1590: Eberhard Windecke, p. 117.]\r\n\r\nAnother time, when she was in a town some miles distant from the\r\nchateau where the King was, as she prayed before going to sleep, it\r\nwas revealed to her that certain of the King's enemies wished to\r\npoison him at dinner. Straightway she called her brothers and sent\r\nthem to the King to advise him to take no food until she came.\r\n\r\nWhen she appeared before him, he was at table surrounded by eleven\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" she said, \"have the dishes brought.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave them to the dogs, who ate from them and died forthwith.\r\n\r\nThen, pointing to a knight, who was near the King and to two other\r\nguests: \"Those persons,\" she said, \"wished to poison you.\"\r\n\r\nThe knight straightway confessed that it was true; and he was dealt\r\nwith according to his deserts.[1591]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1591: _Ibid._, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nIt was borne in upon her that a certain priest kept a concubine;[1592]\r\nand one day, meeting in the camp a woman dressed as a man, it was\r\nrevealed to her that the woman was pregnant and that having already\r\nhad one child she had made away with it.[1593]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1592: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 146.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1593: Eberhard Windecke, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nShe was likewise said to possess the power of discovering things\r\nhidden. She herself had claimed this power when she was at Tours. It\r\nhad been revealed to her that a sword was buried in the ground in the\r\nchapel of Saint Catherine of Fierbois, and that was the sword she\r\nwore. Some deemed it to be the sword with which Charles Martel had\r\ndefeated the Saracens. Others suspected it of being the sword of\r\nAlexander the Great.[1594]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1594: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 76, 234. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 277. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 69, 70.\r\n_Journal du siege_, pp. 49, 50. _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_,\r\npp. 337, 338. Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 108, 109. Abbe Bourasse, _Les\r\nmiracles de Madame Sainte Katerine_, Introduction.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner it was said that before the coronation Jeanne had known\r\nof a precious crown, hidden from all eyes. And here is the story told\r\nconcerning it:\r\n\r\nA bishop kept the crown of Saint Louis. No one knew which bishop it\r\nwas, but it was known that the Maid had sent him a messenger, bearing\r\na letter in which she asked him to give up the crown. The bishop\r\nreplied that the Maid was dreaming. A second time she demanded the\r\nsacred treasure, and the bishop made the same reply. Then she wrote to\r\nthe citizens of the episcopal city, saying that if the crown were not\r\ngiven up to the King, the Lord would punish the town, and straightway\r\nthere fell so heavy a storm of hail that all men marvelled. Wizards\r\ncommonly caused hail storms. But this time the hail was a plague sent\r\nby the God who afflicted Egypt with ten plagues. After which the Maid\r\ndespatched to the citizens a third letter in which she described the\r\nform and fashion of the crown the bishop was hiding, and warned them\r\nthat if it were not given up even worse things would happen to them.\r\nThe bishop, who believed that the wondrous circlet of gold was known\r\nto him alone, marvelled that the form and fashion thereof should be\r\ndescribed in this letter. He repented of his wickedness, wept many\r\ntears, and commanded the crown to be sent to the King and the\r\nMaid.[1595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1595: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 160, 163.]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discern the origin of this story. The crown of\r\nCharlemagne, which the kings of France wore at the coronation\r\nceremony, was at Saint-Denys in France, in the hands of the English.\r\nJeanne boasted of having given the Dauphin at Chinon a precious crown,\r\nbrought by angels. She said that this crown had been sent to Reims for\r\nthe coronation, but that it did not arrive in time.[1596] As for the\r\nhiding of the crown by the bishop, that idea arose probably from the\r\nwell-known cupidity of my Lord Regnault de Chartres, Archbishop of\r\nReims, who had appropriated the silver vase intended for the chapter\r\nand placed by the King upon the high altar after the ceremony.[1597]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1596: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1597: Dom Marlot, _Histoire de l'Eglise de Reims_, vol. iv,\r\np. 175. H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, appendix xvii.]\r\n\r\nThere was likewise talk of gloves lost at Reims and of a cup that\r\nJeanne had found.[1598]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1598: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 104.]\r\n\r\nMaiden, at once a warrior and a lover of peace, _beguine_, prophetess,\r\nsorceress, angel of the Lord, ogress, every man beholds her according\r\nto his own fashion, creates her according to his own image. Pious\r\nsouls clothe her with an invincible charm and the divine gift of\r\ncharity; simple souls make her simple too; men gross and violent\r\nfigure her a giantess, burlesque and terrible. Shall we ever discern\r\nthe true features of her countenance? Behold her, from the first and\r\nperhaps for ever enclosed in a flowering thicket of legends!\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

Perceval de\r\nCagny, pp. 160, 161. _Journal du siege_, p. 115. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 98. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 196.]\r\n\r\nThis town constituted a part of the Duchy of Valois, held jointly by\r\nthe Houses of Orleans and of Bar.[1600] Of its dukes, one was a prisoner\r\nin the hands of the English; the other was connected with the French\r\nparty through his brother-in-law, King Charles, and with the\r\nBurgundian party through his father-in-law, the Duke of Lorraine. No\r\nwonder the fealty of the townsfolk was somewhat vacillating;\r\ndowntrodden by men-at-arms, forever taken and retaken, red caps and\r\nwhite caps alternately ran the danger of being cast into the river.\r\nThe Burgundians set fire to the houses, pillaged the churches,\r\nchastised the most notable burgesses; then came the Armagnacs, who\r\nsacked everything, made great slaughter of men, women, and children,\r\nravished nuns, worthy wives, and honest maids. The Saracens could not\r\nhave done worse.[1601] City dames had been seen making sacks in which\r\nBurgundians were to be sewn up and thrown into the Aisne.[1602]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1600: _Ordonnances des rois de France_, vol. ix, p. 71.

The bells pealed, the folk\r\ncried \"Noel,\" and the burgesses proffered the King two barbels, six\r\nsheep and six gallons of \"_bon suret_,\"[1604] begging the King to forgive\r\nits being so little, but the war had ruined them.[1605] They, like the\r\npeople of Troyes, refused to open their gates to the men-at-arms, by\r\nvirtue of their privileges, and because they had not food enough for\r\ntheir support. The army encamped in the plain of Ambleny.[1606]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1603: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 323, 324. Perceval de\r\nCagny, p. 160.

Indeed it was important to capture\r\nthis town from Duke Philip, for it was the key to l'Ile-de-France and\r\nought to be taken before the Duke had time to bring up an army. But\r\nthroughout this campaign the King of France was resolved to recapture\r\nhis towns rather by diplomacy and persuasion than by force. Between\r\nthe 22nd and the 25th of July he three times summoned the inhabitants\r\nof Compiegne to surrender. Being desirous to gain time and to have the\r\nair of being constrained, they entered into negotiations.[1607]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1607: De l'Epinois, _Notes extraites des archives communales de\r\nCompiegne_, in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, vol. xxix, p.\r\n483.

In the evening\r\nthe King entered.[1608] Coulommiers, Crecy-en-Brie, and Provins\r\nsubmitted.[1609]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1608: Perceval de Cagny, p. 160.

On the morrow he gained Provins and came within a short\r\ndistance of the passage of the Seine and the high-roads of central\r\nFrance.[1610] The army was sore anhungered, finding nought to eat in\r\nthese ravaged fields and pillaged cities. Through lack of victuals\r\npreparations were being made for retreat into Poitou. But this design\r\nwas thwarted by the English. While ungarrisoned towns were being\r\nreduced, the English Regent had been gathering an army. It was now\r\nadvancing on Corbeil and Melun. On its approach the French gained La\r\nMotte-Nangis, some twelve miles from Provins, where they took up their\r\nposition on ground flat and level, such as was convenient for the\r\nfighting of a battle, as battles were fought in those days. For one\r\nwhole day they remained in battle array. There was no sign of the\r\nEnglish coming to attack them.[1611]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1610: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 160, 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1611: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 324, 325. _Journal du\r\nsiege_, p. 115.

Believing\r\nthat they had been abandoned, they were afraid lest the English and\r\nBurgundians should make them pay dearly for the coronation of the King\r\nof the Armagnacs; and in truth they stood in great danger. On the 3rd\r\nof August, they resolved to send a message to King Charles to entreat\r\nhim not to forsake those cities which had submitted to him. The city's\r\nherald set out forthwith. On the morrow they sent word to their good\r\nfriends of Chalons and of Laon, how they had heard that King Charles\r\nwas wending towards Orleans and Bourges, and how they had sent him a\r\nmessage.[1612]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1612: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 98.

Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_,\r\noriginal doc. no. 19, p. 118.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of August, while the King is still at Provins[1613] or in the\r\nneighbourhood, Jeanne addresses to the townsfolk of Reims a letter\r\ndated from the camp, on the road to Paris. Herein she promises not to\r\ndesert her friends faithful and beloved. She appears to have no\r\nsuspicion of the projected retreat on the Loire. Wherefore it is clear\r\nthat the magistrates of Reims have not written to her and that she is\r\nnot admitted to the royal counsels. She has been instructed, however,\r\nthat the King has concluded a fifteen days' truce with the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, and thereof she informs the citizens of Reims. This truce is\r\ndispleasing to her; and she doubts whether she will observe it. If she\r\ndoes observe it, it will be solely on account of the King's honour;\r\nand even then she must be persuaded that there is no trickery in it.\r\nShe will therefore keep the royal army together and in readiness to\r\nmarch at the end of the fifteen days. She closes her letter with a\r\nrecommendation to the townsfolk to keep good guard and to send her\r\nword if they have need of her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1613: Perceval de Cagny, p. 160.]\r\n\r\nHere is the letter:\r\n\r\n     \"Good friends and beloved, ye good and loyal French of the\r\n     city of Rains, Jehanne the Maid lets you wit of her tidings\r\n     and prays and requires you not to doubt the good cause she\r\n     maintains for the Blood Royal; and I promise and assure you\r\n     that I will never forsake you as long as I shall live. It is\r\n     true that the King has made truce with the Duke of Burgundy\r\n     for the space of fifteen days, by which he is to surrender\r\n     peaceably the city of Paris at the end of fifteen days.\r\n     Notwithstanding, marvel ye not if I do not straightway enter\r\n     into it, for truces thus made are not pleasing unto me, and\r\n     I know not whether I shall keep them; but if I keep them it\r\n     will be solely to maintain the King's honour; and further\r\n     they shall not ensnare the Royal Blood, for I will keep and\r\n     maintain together the King's army that it be ready at the\r\n     end of fifteen days, if they make not peace. Wherefore my\r\n     beloved and perfect friends, I pray ye to be in no\r\n     disquietude as long as I shall live; but I require you to\r\n     keep good watch and to defend well the good city of the\r\n     King; and to make known unto me if there be any traitors who\r\n     would do you hurt, and, as speedily as I may, I will take\r\n     them out from among you; and send me of your tidings. To\r\n     God I commend you. May he have you in his keeping.\"\r\n\r\n     Written this Friday, 5th day of August, near Provins,[1614] a\r\n     camp in the country or on the Paris road. Addressed to: the\r\n     loyal French of the town of Rains.[1615]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1614: This place name is not to be found in Rogier's copy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1615: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 139, 140, and Varin, _loc. cit._\r\n_Statuts_, vol. i, p. 603, according to Rogier's copy.

She had then attained to the very\r\nhighest degree of heroic saintliness. Here, in this letter, she takes\r\nto herself a supernatural power, to which the King, his Councillors\r\nand his Captains must submit. She ascribes to herself alone the right\r\nof recognising or denouncing treaties; she disposes entirely of the\r\narmy. And, because she commands in the name of the King of Heaven, her\r\ncommands are absolute. There is happening to her what necessarily\r\nhappens to all those who believe themselves entrusted with a divine\r\nmission; they constitute themselves a spiritual and temporal power\r\nsuperior to the established powers and inevitably hostile to them. A\r\ndangerous illusion and productive of shocks in which the illuminated\r\nare generally the worst sufferers! Every day of her life living and\r\nholding converse with saints and angels, moving in the splendour of\r\nthe Church Triumphant, this young peasant girl came to believe that in\r\nher resided all strength, all prudence, all wisdom and all counsel.\r\nThis does not mean that she was lacking in intelligence; on the\r\ncontrary she rightly perceived that the Duke of Burgundy, with his\r\nembassies, was but playing with the King and that Charles was being\r\ntricked by a Prince, who knew how to disguise his craft in\r\nmagnificence. Not that Duke Philip was an enemy of peace; on the\r\ncontrary he desired it, but he was desirous not to come to an open\r\nquarrel with the English. Jeanne knew little of the affairs of\r\nBurgundy and of France, but her judgment was none the less sound.\r\nConcerning the relative positions of the Kings of France and England,\r\nbetween whom there could be no agreement, since the matter in dispute\r\nwas the possession of the kingdom, her ideas were very simple but very\r\ncorrect. Equally accurate were her views of the position of the King\r\nof France with regard to his great vassal, the Duke of Burgundy, with\r\nwhom an understanding was not only possible and desirable, but\r\nnecessary. She pronounced thereupon in a perfectly straightforward\r\nfashion: On the one hand there is peace with the Burgundians and on\r\nthe other peace with the English; concerning the peace with the Duke\r\nof Burgundy, by letters and by ambassadors have I required him to come\r\nto terms with the King; as for the English, the only way of making\r\npeace with them is for them to go back to their country, to\r\nEngland.[1616]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1616: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 233, 234.]\r\n\r\nThis truce that so highly displeased her we know not when it was\r\nconcluded, whether at Soissons or Chateau-Thierry, on the 30th or 31st\r\nof July, or at Provins between the 2nd and 5th of August.[1617] It would\r\nappear that it was to last fifteen days, at the end of which time the\r\nDuke was to undertake to surrender Paris to the King of France. The\r\nMaid had good reason for her mistrust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1617: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 202, 203, note 2.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Regent withdrew before him, King Charles eagerly returned to\r\nhis plan of retreating into Poitou. From La Motte-Nangis he sent his\r\nquartermasters to Bray-sur-Seine, which had just submitted. Situated\r\nabove Montereau and ten miles south of Provins, this town had a bridge\r\nover the river, across which the royal army was to pass on the 5th of\r\nAugust or in the morning of the 6th; but the English came by night,\r\novercame the quartermasters and took possession of the bridge; with\r\nits retreat cut off, the royal army had to retrace its march.[1618]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1618: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 325. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 99, 100. _Journal du siege_, pp. 119, 120.\r\nGilles de Roye, p. 207.]\r\n\r\nWithin this army, which had not fought and which was being devoured by\r\nhunger, there existed a party of zealots, led by those whom Jeanne\r\nfondly called the Royal Blood.[1619] They were the Duke of Alencon, the\r\nDuke of Bourbon, the Count of Vendome, and likewise the Duke of Bar,\r\nwho had just come from the War of the Apple Baskets.[1620] Before he\r\ntook to painting pictures and writing moralities in rhyme, this young\r\nson of the Lady Yolande had been a warrior. Duke of Bar and heir of\r\nLorraine, he had been forced to join the English and Burgundians.\r\nBrother-in-law of King Charles, he must needs rejoice when the latter\r\nwas victorious, because, but for that victory, he would never have\r\nbeen able to range himself on the side of the Queen, his sister, for\r\nwhich he would have been very sorry.[1621] Jeanne knew him; not long\r\nbefore, she had asked the Duke of Lorraine to send him with her into\r\nFrance.[1622] He was said to have been one of those who of their own\r\nfree will followed her to Paris. Among the others were the two sons of\r\nthe Lady of Laval, Gui, the eldest to whom she had offered wine at\r\nSelles-en-Berry, promising soon to give him to drink at Paris, and\r\nAndre, who afterwards became Marshal of Loheac.[1623] This was the army\r\nof the Maid: a band of youths, scarcely more than children, who ranged\r\ntheir banners side by side with the banner of a girl younger than\r\nthey, but more innocent and better.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1619: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1620: _Guerre de la Hottee de Pommes_, cf. vol. i, p. 92.\r\n(W.S.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1621: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaut de Metz_ in D.\r\nCalmet. _Histoire de Lorraine_, vol. v, orig. docs., cols, xli-xlvii.\r\nVilleneuve-Bargemont, _Precis historique de la vie du roi Rene_, Aix,\r\n1820, in 8vo.

On the morning\r\nof Sunday, the 7th, it was at Coulommiers; it recrossed the Marne at\r\nChateau-Thierry.[1626] King Charles received a message from the\r\ninhabitants of Reims, entreating him to draw nearer to them.[1627] He\r\nwas at La Ferte on the 10th, on the 11th at Crepy in Valois.[1628]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1626: Perceval de Cagny, p. 161. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_,\r\nvol. i, p. 100. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1627: Varin, _Archives legislatives de la ville de Reims_,\r\nStatuts, vol. i, p. 742.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1628: Perceval de Cagny, p. 161.]\r\n\r\nAt one stage of the march on La Ferte and Crepy, the Maid was riding\r\nin company with the King, between the Archbishop of Reims and my Lord\r\nthe Bastard. Beholding the people hastening to come before the King\r\nand crying \"Noel!\" she exclaimed: \"Good people! Never have I seen folk\r\nso glad at the coming of the fair King....\"[1629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1629: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 14, 15. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 326.]\r\n\r\nThese peasants of Valois and of l'Ile de France, who cried \"Noel!\" on\r\nthe coming of King Charles, in like manner hailed the Regent and the\r\nDuke of Burgundy when they passed. Doubtless they were not so glad as\r\nthey seemed to Jeanne, and if the little Saint had listened at the\r\ndoors of their poor homes, this is about what she would have heard:\r\n\"What shall we do? Let us surrender our all to the devil. It matters\r\nnot what shall become of us, for, through treason and bad government,\r\nwe must needs forsake our wives and children and flee into the woods,\r\nlike wild beasts. And it is not one year or two but fourteen or\r\nfifteen since we have been led this unhappy dance. And most of the\r\ngreat nobles of France have died by the sword, or unconfessed have\r\nfallen victims to poison or to treachery, or in short have perished by\r\nsome manner of violent death. Better for us would it have been to\r\nserve Saracens than Christians. Whether one lives badly or well it\r\ncomes to the same thing. Let us do all the evil that lieth in our\r\npower. No worse can happen to us than to be slain or taken.\"[1630]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1630: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nIt was only in the neighbourhood of towns or close to fortresses and\r\ncastles, within sight of the watchman's eye as he looked from the top\r\nof tower or belfry, that land was cultivated. On the approach of\r\nmen-at-arms, the watchman rang his bell or sounded his horn to warn\r\nthe vine-dressers or the ploughmen to flee to a place of safety. In\r\nmany districts the alarm bell was so frequent that oxen, sheep, and\r\npigs, of their own accord went into hiding, as soon as they heard\r\nit.[1631]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1631: Thomas Basin, _Histoire de Charles VII_, chap. vi.

For some distance from Beauvais,\r\nfrom Senlis, from Soissons, from Laon, they had caused the fields to\r\nlie fallow, and here and there shrubs and underwood were springing up\r\nover land once cultivated.--\"Noel! Noel!\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the duchy of Valois, the peasants were abandoning the open\r\ncountry and hiding in woods, rocks, and quarries.[1632]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1632: Pardon issued by King Henry VI to an inhabitant of\r\nNoyant, in Stevenson, _Letters and Papers_, vol. i, pp. 23, 31. F.\r\nBrun, _Jeanne d'Arc et le capitaine de Soissons_, note iii, p. 41.]\r\n\r\nMany, in order to gain a livelihood, did like Jean de Bonval, the\r\ntailor of Noyant near Soissons, who, despite wife and children, joined\r\na Burgundian band, which went up and down the country thieving,\r\npillaging, and, when occasion offered, smoking out the folk who had\r\ntaken refuge in churches. On one day Jean and his comrades took two\r\nhogsheads of corn, on another six or seven cows; on another a goat and\r\na cow, on another a silver belt, a pair of gloves and a pair of shoes;\r\non another a bale of eighteen ells of cloth to make cloaks withal. And\r\nJean de Bonval said that within his knowledge many a man of worship\r\ndid as much.[1633]--\"Noel! Noel!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1633: Stevenson, _Letters and Papers_, vol. i, pp. 23, 31.]\r\n\r\nThe Armagnacs and Burgundians had torn the coats off the peasants'\r\nbacks and seized even their pots and pans. It was not far from Crepy\r\nto Meaux. Every one in that country had heard of the Tree of Vauru.\r\n\r\nAt one of the gates of the town of Meaux was a great elm, whereon the\r\nBastard of Vauru, a Gascon noble of the Dauphin's party, used to hang\r\nthe peasants he had taken, when they could not pay their ransom. When\r\nhe had no executioner at hand he used to hang them himself. With him\r\nthere lived a kinsman, my Lord Denis de Vauru, who was called his\r\ncousin, not that he was so in fact, but just to show that one was no\r\nbetter than the other.[1634] In the month of March, in the year 1420, my\r\nLord Denis, on one of his expeditions, came across a peasant tilling\r\nthe ground. He took him prisoner, held him to ransom, and, tying him\r\nto his horse's tail, dragged him back to Meaux, where, by threats and\r\ntorture, he exacted from him a promise to pay three times as much as\r\nhe possessed. Dragged half dead from his dungeon, the villein sent to\r\nthe wife he had married that year to ask her to bring the sum demanded\r\nby the lord. She was with child, and near the time of her delivery;\r\nnotwithstanding, she came because she loved her husband and hoped to\r\nsoften the heart of the Lord of Vauru. She failed; and Messire Denis\r\ntold her that if by a certain day he did not receive the ransom, he\r\nwould hang the man from the elm-tree. The poor woman went away in\r\ntears, fondly commending her husband to God's keeping. And her husband\r\nwept for pity of her. By a great effort, she succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe sum demanded, but not by the day appointed. When she returned, her\r\nhusband had been hanged from the Vauru Tree without respite or mercy.\r\nWith bitter sobs she asked for him, and then fell exhausted by the\r\nside of that road, which, on the point of her delivery, she had\r\ntraversed on foot. Having regained consciousness, a second time she\r\nasked for her husband. She was told that she would not see him till\r\nthe ransom had been paid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1634: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 170, 171.\r\nMonstrelet, vol. iv, p. 96. _Livre des trahisons_, pp. 167, 168.]\r\n\r\nWhile she was before the Gascon, there in sight of her were brought\r\nforth several craftsmen, held to ransom, who, unable to pay, were\r\nstraightway despatched to be hanged or drowned. At this spectacle a\r\ngreat fear for her husband came over her; nevertheless, her love for\r\nhim gave her heart of courage and she paid the ransom. As soon as the\r\nDuke's men had counted the coins, they dismissed her saying that her\r\nhusband had died like the other villeins.\r\n\r\nAt those cruel words, wild with sorrow and despair, she broke forth\r\ninto curses and railing. When she refused to be silent, the Bastard\r\nof Vauru had her beaten and taken to the Elm-tree.\r\n\r\nThere she was stripped to the waist and tied to the Tree, whence hung\r\nforty to fifty men, some from the higher, some from the lower\r\nbranches, so that, when the wind blew, their bodies touched her head.\r\nAt nightfall she uttered shrieks so piercing that they were heard in\r\nthe town. But whosoever had dared to go and unloose her would have\r\nbeen a dead man. Fright, fatigue, and exertion brought on her\r\ndelivery. The wolves, attracted by her cries, came and consumed the\r\nfruit of her womb, and then devoured alive the body of the wretched\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nIn 1422, the town of Meaux was taken by the Burgundians. Then were the\r\nBastard of Vauru and his cousin hanged from that Tree on which they\r\nhad caused so many innocent folk to die so shameful a death.[1635]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1635: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 170. According to\r\nMonstrelet (vol. iv, p. 96), Denis de Vauru, the Bastard's cousin, was\r\nbeheaded in the Market of Paris.]\r\n\r\nFor the poor peasants of these unhappy lands, whether Armagnac or\r\nBurgundian, it was all of a piece; they had nothing to gain by\r\nchanging masters. Nevertheless, it is possible that, on beholding the\r\nKing, the descendant of Saint Louis and Charles the Wise, they may\r\nhave taken heart of courage and of hope, so great was the fame for\r\njustice and for mercy of the illustrious house of France.\r\n\r\nThus, riding by the side of the Archbishop of Reims, the Maid looked\r\nwith a friendly eye on the peasants crying \"Noel!\" After saying that\r\nshe had nowhere seen folk so joyful at the coming of the fair King,\r\nshe sighed: \"Would to God I were so fortunate as, when I die, to find\r\nburial in this land.\"[1636]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1636: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 14, 15. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 326.]\r\n\r\nPeradventure the Lord Archbishop was curious to know whether from her\r\nVoices she had received any revelation concerning her approaching\r\ndeath. She often said that she would not last long. Doubtless he was\r\nacquainted with a prophecy widely known at that time, that the maid\r\nwould die in the Holy Land, after having reconquered with King Charles\r\nthe sepulchre of our Lord. There were those who attributed this\r\nprophecy to the Maid herself; for she had told her Confessor that she\r\nwould die in battle with the Infidel, and that after her God would\r\nsend a Maid of Rome who would take her place.[1637] And it is obvious\r\nthat Messire Regnault knew what store to set on such things. At any\r\nrate, for that reason or for another, he asked: \"Jeanne, in what place\r\nlook you for to die?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1637: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 108, 109, 188, 189.]\r\n\r\nTo which she made answer: \"Where it shall please God. For I am sure\r\nneither of the time nor of the place, and I know no more thereof than\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer could have been more devout. My Lord the Bastard, who was\r\npresent at this conversation, many years later thought he remembered\r\nthat Jeanne had added: \"But I would it were now God's pleasure for me\r\nto retire, leaving my arms, and to go and serve my father and mother,\r\nkeeping sheep with my brethren and sister.\"[1638]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1638: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 14, 15. It is Dunois who is\r\ngiving evidence, and the text runs: _In custodiendo oves ipsorum, cum\r\nsorore et fratribus meis, qui multum gauderent videre me_. But there\r\nis reason to believe she had only one sister, whom she had lost before\r\ncoming into France. As for her brothers, two of them were with her.\r\nDunois' evidence appears to have been written down by a clerk\r\nunacquainted with events. The hagiographical character of the passage\r\nis obvious.]\r\n\r\nIf she really spoke thus, it was doubtless because she was haunted by\r\ndark forebodings. For some time she had believed herself betrayed.[1639]\r\nPossibly she suspected the Lord Archbishop of Reims of wishing her\r\nill. But it is hard to believe that he can have thought of getting rid\r\nof her now when he had employed her with such signal success; rather\r\nhis intention was to make further use of her. Nevertheless he did not\r\nlike her, and she felt it. He never consulted her and never told her\r\nwhat had been decided in council. And she suffered cruelly from the\r\nsmall account made of the revelations she was always receiving so\r\nabundantly. May we not interpret as a subtle and delicate reproach the\r\nutterance in his presence of this wish, this complaint? Doubtless she\r\nlonged for her absent mother. And yet she was mistaken when she\r\nthought that henceforth she could endure the tranquil life of a\r\nvillage maiden. In her childhood at Domremy she seldom went to tend\r\nthe flocks in the field; she preferred to occupy herself in household\r\naffairs;[1640] but if, after having waged war beside the King and the\r\nnobles, she had had to return to her country and keep sheep, she would\r\nnot have stayed there six months. Henceforth it was impossible for her\r\nto live save with that knighthood, to whose company she believed God\r\nhad called her. All her heart was there, and she had finished with the\r\ndistaff.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1639: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 423.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1640: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 51, 66.]\r\n\r\nDuring the march on La Ferte and Crepy, King Charles received a\r\nchallenge from the Regent, then at Montereau with his baronage,\r\ncalling upon him to fix a meeting at whatsoever place he should\r\nappoint.[1641] \"We, who with all our hearts,\" said the Duke of Bedford,\r\n\"desire the end of the war, summon and require you, if you have pity\r\nand compassion on the poor folk, who in your cause have so long time\r\nbeen cruelly treated, downtrodden, and oppressed, to appoint a place\r\nsuitable either in this land of Brie, where we both are, or in\r\nl'Ile-de-France. There will we meet. And if you have any proposal of\r\npeace to make unto us, we will listen to it and as beseemeth a good\r\nCatholic prince we will take counsel thereon.\"[1642]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1641: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 340, 344.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1642: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 342.]\r\n\r\nThis arrogant and insulting letter had not been penned by the Regent\r\nin any desire or hope of peace, but rather, against all reason, to\r\nthrow on King Charles's shoulders the responsibility for the miseries\r\nand suffering the war was causing the commonalty.\r\n\r\nWriting to the King crowned in Reims Cathedral, from the beginning he\r\naddresses him in this disdainful manner: \"You who were accustomed to\r\ncall yourself Dauphin of Viennois and who now without reason take unto\r\nyourself the title of King.\" He declares that he wants peace and then\r\nadds forthwith: \"Not a peace hollow, corrupt, feigned, violated,\r\nperjured, like that of Montereau, on which, by your fault and your\r\nconsent, there followed that terrible and detestable murder, committed\r\ncontrary to all law and honour of knighthood, on the person of our\r\nlate dear and greatly loved Father, Jean, Duke of Burgundy.\"[1643]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1643: _Ibid._, pp. 342, 343.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord of Bedford had married one of the daughters of that Duke Jean,\r\nwho had been treacherously murdered in revenge for the assassination\r\nof the Duke of Orleans. But indeed it was not wisely to prepare the\r\nway of peace to cast the crime of Montereau in the face of Charles of\r\nValois, who had been dragged there as a child and with whom there had\r\nremained ever after a physical trembling and a haunting fear of\r\ncrossing bridges.[1644]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1644: Georges Chastellain, fragments published by J. Quicherat\r\nin _La Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, 1st series, vol. iv, p.\r\n78.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment the Duke of Bedford's most serious grievance against\r\nCharles was that he was accompanied by the Maid and Friar Richard.\r\n\"You cause the ignorant folk to be seduced and deceived,\" he said,\r\n\"for you are supported by superstitious and reprobate persons, such as\r\nthis woman of ill fame and disorderly life, wearing man's attire and\r\ndissolute in manners, and likewise by that apostate and seditious\r\nmendicant friar, they both alike being, according to Holy Scripture,\r\nabominable in the sight of God.\"\r\n\r\nTo strike still greater shame into the heart of the enemy, the Duke of\r\nBedford proceeds to a second attack on the maiden and the monk. And in\r\nthe most eloquent passage of the letter, when he is citing Charles of\r\nValois to appear before him, he says ironically that he expects to see\r\nhim come led by this woman of ill fame and this apostate monk.[1645]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1645: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 341, 342.]\r\n\r\nThus wrote the Regent of England; albeit he had a mind, subtle,\r\nmoderate, and graceful, he was moreover a good Catholic and a believer\r\nin all manner of devilry and witchcraft.\r\n\r\nHis horror at the army of Charles of Valois being commanded by a witch\r\nand a heretic monk was certainly sincere, and he deemed it wise to\r\npublish the scandal. There were doubtless only too many, who, like\r\nhim, were ready to believe that the Maid of the Armagnacs was a\r\nheretic, a worshipper of idols and given to the practice of magic. In\r\nthe opinion of many worthy and wise Burgundians a prince must forfeit\r\nhis honour by keeping such company. And if Jeanne were in very deed a\r\nwitch, what a disgrace! What an abomination! The Flowers de Luce\r\nreinstated by the devil! The Dauphin's whole camp was tainted by it.\r\nAnd yet when my Lord of Bedford spread abroad those ideas he was not\r\nso adroit as he thought.\r\n\r\nJeanne, as we know, was good-hearted and in energy untiring. By\r\ninspiring the men of her party with the idea that she brought them\r\ngood luck, she gave them courage.[1646] Nevertheless King Charles's\r\ncounsellors knew what she could do for them and avoided consulting\r\nher. She herself felt that she would not last long.[1647] Then who\r\nrepresented her as a great war leader? Who exalted her as a\r\nsupernatural power? The enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1646: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 324; vol. iii, p. 130. Monstrelet,\r\nvol. iv, p. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1647: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nThis letter shows how the English had transformed an innocent child\r\ninto a being unnatural, terrible, redoubtable, into a spectre of hell\r\ncausing the bravest to grow pale. In a voice of lamentation the Regent\r\ncries: The devil! the witch! And then he marvels that his fighting men\r\ntremble before the Maid, and desert rather than face her.[1648]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1648: _Ibid._, vol. iv, pp. 206, 406, 444, 470, 472.

Now it once\r\nagain came forth to meet the French. On Saturday, the 13th of August,\r\nKing Charles held the country between Crepy and Paris. Now the Maid\r\nfrom the heights of Dammartin could espy the summit of Montmartre\r\nwith its windmills, and the light mists from the Seine veiling that\r\ngreat city of Paris, promised to her by those Voices which alas! she\r\nhad heeded too well.[1649] On the morrow, Sunday, the King and his army\r\nencamped in a village, by name Barron, on the River Nonnette on which,\r\nfive miles lower down, stands Senlis.[1650]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1649: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 246, 298.

Perceval de Cagny,\r\npp. 161, 162.]\r\n\r\nSenlis was subject to the English.[1651] It was said that the Regent was\r\napproaching with a great company of men-at-arms, commanded by the Earl\r\nof Suffolk, the Lord Talbot and the Bastard Saint Pol. With him were\r\nthe crusaders of the Cardinal of Winchester, the late King's uncle,\r\nbetween three thousand five hundred and four thousand men, paid with\r\nthe Pope's money to go and fight against the Hussites in Bohemia. The\r\nCardinal judged it well to use them against the King of France, a very\r\nChristian King forsooth, but one whose hosts were commanded by a witch\r\nand an apostate.[1652] It was reported that, in the English camp, was a\r\ncaptain with fifteen hundred men-at-arms, clothed in white, bearing a\r\nwhite standard, on which was embroidered a distaff whence was\r\nsuspended a spindle; and on the streamer of the banner was worked in\r\nfine letters of gold: \"_Ores, vienne la Belle!_\"[1653] By these words\r\nthe men-at-arms wished to proclaim that if they were to meet the Maid\r\nof the Armagnacs she would find her work cut out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1651: Flammermont, _Histoire de Senlis pendant la seconds\r\npartie de la guerre de cent ans_ (1405-1441), in _Memoires de la\r\nSociete de l'Histoire de Paris_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1652: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 101, 102.\r\n_Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 328. _Journal du siege_, p. 118.\r\nFalconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 453.

But King Charles's army, which was coming down the Nonnette\r\nvalley, did not arrive in time to surprise them.[1654] It passed the\r\nnight opposite them, near Montepilloy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1654: Perceval de Cagny, p. 162. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_,\r\nvol. i, p. 102. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 329. _Journal du siege_,\r\npp. 119, 120.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Monday, the 15th of August, at daybreak, the\r\nmen-at-arms heard mass in camp and, as far as might be, cleared their\r\nconsciences; for great plunderers and whoremongers as they were, they\r\nhad not given up hope of winning Paradise when this life should be\r\nover. That day was a solemn feast, when the Church, on the authority\r\nof St. Gregoire de Tours, commemorates the physical and spiritual\r\nexaltation to heaven of the Virgin Mary. Churchmen taught that it\r\nbehoves men to keep the feasts of Our Lord and the Holy Virgin, and\r\nthat to wage battle on days consecrated to them is to sin grievously\r\nagainst the glorious Mother of God. No one in King Charles's camp\r\ncould maintain a contrary opinion, since all were Christians as they\r\nwere in the camp of the Regent. And yet, immediately after the _Deo\r\nGratias_, every man took up his post ready for battle.[1655]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1655: Perceval de Cagny, p. 161.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the established rule, the army was in several divisions:\r\nthe van-guard, the archers, the main body, the rear-guard and the\r\nthree wings.[1656] Further, and according to the same rule, there had\r\nbeen formed a skirmishing company, destined if need were to succour\r\nand reinforce the other divisions. It was commanded by Captain La\r\nHire, my Lord the Bastard, and the Sire d'Albret, La Tremouille's\r\nhalf-brother. With this company was the Maid. At the Battle of Patay,\r\ndespite her entreaties, she had been forced to keep with the\r\nrear-guard; now she rode with the bravest and ablest, with those\r\nskirmishers or scouts, whose duty it was, says Jean de Bueil,[1657] to\r\nrepulse the scouts of the opposite party and to observe the number and\r\nthe ordering of the enemy.[1658] At length justice was done her; at\r\nlength she was assigned the place which her skill in horsemanship and\r\nher courage in battle merited; and yet she hesitated to follow her\r\ncomrades. According to the report of a Burgundian knight chronicler,\r\nthere she was, \"swayed to and fro, at one moment wishing to fight, at\r\nanother not.\"[1659]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1656: _Le Jouvencel_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1657: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 329. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1658: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1659: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 346.]\r\n\r\nHer perplexity is easily comprehensible. The little Saint could not\r\nbring herself to decide whether to ride forth to battle on the day of\r\nour Lady's Feast or to fold her arms while fighting was going on\r\naround her. Her Voices intensified her indecision. They never\r\ninstructed her what to do save when she knew herself. In the end she\r\nwent with the men-at-arms, not one of whom appears to have shared her\r\nscruples. The two armies were but the space of a culverin shot\r\napart.[1660] She, with certain of her company, went right up to the\r\ndykes and to the carts, behind which the English were entrenched.\r\nSundry _Godons_ and men of Picardy came forth from their camp and\r\nfought, some on foot, others on horseback against an equal number of\r\nFrench. On both sides there were wounded, and prisoners were taken.\r\nThis hand to hand fighting continued the whole day; at sunset the most\r\nserious skirmish happened, and so much dust was raised that it was\r\nimpossible to see anything.[1661] On that day there befell what had\r\nhappened on the 17th of June, between Beaugency and Meung. With the\r\narmaments and the customs of warfare of those days, it was very\r\ndifficult to force an army to come out of its entrenched camp.\r\nGenerally, if a battle was to be fought, it was necessary for the two\r\nsides to be in accord, and, after the pledge of battle had been sent\r\nand accepted, for each to level his own half of the field where the\r\nengagement was to take place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1660: Perceval de Cagny, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1661: Jean Chartier, _Chronique de la Pucelle_. _Journal du\r\nsiege._ Monstrelet, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall the skirmishing ceased, and the two armies slept at a\r\ncrossbow-shot from each other. Then King Charles went off to Crepy,\r\nleaving the English free to go and relieve the town of Evreux, which\r\nhad agreed to surrender on the 27th of August. With this town the\r\nRegent made sure of Normandy.[1662]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1662: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 332. Perceval de Cagny, p.\r\n165. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 106.

If, after\r\nthe victory of Patay, they had hastened at once to Rouen, Normandy\r\nwould have been reconquered and the English cast into the sea; if,\r\nfrom Patay they had pushed on to Paris they would have entered the\r\ncity without resistance. Yet we must not too hastily condemn that\r\nceremonious promenading of the Lilies through Champagne. By the march\r\nto Reims the French party, those Armagnacs reviled for their cruelty\r\nand felony, that little King of Bourges compromised in an infamous\r\nambuscade, may have won advantages greater and more solid than the\r\nconquest of the county of Maine and the duchy of Normandy and than a\r\nvictorious assault on the first city of the realm. By retaking his\r\ntowns of Champagne and of France without bloodshed, King Charles\r\nappeared to advantage as a good and pacific lord, as a prince wise and\r\ndebonair, as the friend of the townsfolk, as the true king of cities.\r\nIn short, by concluding that campaign of honest and successful\r\nnegotiations and by the august ceremonial of the coronation, he came\r\nforth at once as the lawful and very holy King of France.\r\n\r\nAn illustrious lady, a descendant of Bolognese nobles and the widow of\r\na knight of Picardy, well versed in the liberal arts, was the author\r\nof a number of lays, virelays,[1663] and ballads. Christine de Pisan,\r\nnoble and high-minded, wrote with distinction in prose and verse.\r\nLoyal to France and a champion of her sex, there was nothing she more\r\nfervently desired than to see the French prosperous and their ladies\r\nhonoured. In her old age she was cloistered in the Abbey of Poissy,\r\nwhere her daughter was a nun. There, on the 31st of July, 1429, she\r\ncompleted a poem of sixty-one stanzas, each containing eight lines of\r\neight syllables, in praise of the Maid. In halting measures and\r\naffected language, these verses expressed the thoughts of the finest,\r\nthe most cultured and the most pious souls touching the angel of war\r\nsent of God to the Dauphin Charles.[1664]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1663: A virelay was a later variation of the lay, differing\r\nfrom it chiefly in the arrangement of the rhymes (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1664: Le Roux de Lincy and Tisserand, _Paris et ses\r\nhistoriens_, pp. 426 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn this work she begins by saying that for eleven years she has spent\r\nher cloistered life in weeping. And in very truth, this noble-hearted\r\nwoman wept over the misfortunes of the realm, into which she had been\r\nborn, wherein she had grown up, where kings and princes had received\r\nher and learned poets had done her honour, and the language of which\r\nshe spoke with the precision of a purist. After eleven years of\r\nmourning, the victories of the Dauphin were her first joy.\r\n\r\n\"At length,\" she says, \"the sun begins to shine once more and the fine\r\ndays to bloom again. That royal child so long despised and offended,\r\nbehold him coming, wearing on his head a crown and accoutred with\r\nspurs of gold. Let us cry: 'Noel! Charles, the seventh of that great\r\nname, King of the French, thou hast recovered thy kingdom, with the\r\nhelp of a Maid.'\"\r\n\r\nChristine recalls a prophecy concerning a King, Charles, son of\r\nCharles, surnamed The Flying Hart,[1665] who was to be emperor. Of this\r\nprophecy we know nothing save that the escutcheon of King Charles VII\r\nwas borne by two winged stags and that a letter to an Italian\r\nmerchant, written in 1429, contains an obscure announcement of the\r\ncoronation of the Dauphin at Rome.[1666]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1665: A winged stag (_le cerf-volant_) is the symbol of a\r\nking. Froissart thus explains its origin. Before setting out for\r\nFlanders, in 1382, Charles VI dreamed that his falcon had flown away.\r\n\"Th[=e] [Transcriber's Note: e with macron] apered sodenly before hym\r\na great hart with wynges whereof he had great joye.\" And the hart bore\r\nhim to his lost bird. Froissart, Bk. II, ch. clxiv. [The Chronycle of\r\nSyr John Froissart translated by Lord Berners, vol. iii, p. 339, Tudor\r\nTranslation, 1901.] (W.S.) According to Juvenal des Ursins, Charles\r\nVI, in 1380, met in the Forest of Senlis a stag with a golden collar\r\nbearing this inscription: _Hoc me Caesar donavit_ (Paillot, _Parfaite\r\nscience des armoiries_, Paris, 1660, in fo., p. 595). In the works of\r\nEustache Deschamps this same allegory is frequently employed to\r\ndesignate the king. (Eustache Deschamps, _OEuvres_, ed. G. Raynaud,\r\nvol. ii, p. 57.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1666: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 66, 67.]\r\n\r\n\"I pray God,\" continued Christine, \"that thou mayest be that one, that\r\nGod will grant thee life to see thy children grow up, that through\r\nthee and through them, France may have joy, that serving God, thou\r\nwage not war to the utterance. My hope is that thou shalt be good,\r\nupright, a friend of justice, greater than any other, that pride sully\r\nnot thy prowess, that thou be gentle, favourable to thy people and\r\nfearing God who hath chosen thee to serve him.\r\n\r\n\"And thou, Maid most happy, most honoured of God, thou hast loosened\r\nthe cord with which France was bound. Canst thou be praised enough,\r\nthou who hast brought peace to this land laid low by war?\r\n\r\n\"Jeanne, born in a propitious hour, blessed be thy creator! Maid, sent\r\nof God, in whom the Holy Ghost shed abroad a ray of his grace, who\r\nhast from him received and dost keep gifts in abundance; never did he\r\nrefuse thy request. Who can ever be thankful enough unto thee?\"\r\n\r\nThe Maid, saviour of the realm, Dame Christine compares to Moses who\r\ndelivered Israel out of the Land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"That a Maid should proffer her breast, whence France may suck the\r\nsweet milk of peace, behold a matter which is above nature!\r\n\r\n\"Joshua was a mighty conqueror. What is there strange in that, since\r\nhe was a strong man? But now behold, a woman, a shepherdess doth\r\nappear, of greater worship than any man. But with God all things are\r\neasy.\r\n\r\n\"By Esther, Judith and Deborah, women of high esteem, he delivered his\r\noppressed people. And well I know there have been women of great\r\nworship. But Jeanne is above all. Through her God hath worked many\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\n\"By a miracle was she sent; the angel of the Lord led her to the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before she could be believed, to clerks and to scholars was she taken\r\nand thoroughly examined. She said she was come from God, and history\r\nproved her saying to be true, for Merlin, the Sibyl and Bede had seen\r\nher in the spirit. In their books they point to her as the saviour of\r\nFrance, and in their prophecies they let wit of her, saying: 'In the\r\nFrench wars she shall bear the banner.' And indeed they relate all the\r\nmanner of her history.\"\r\n\r\nWe are not astonished that Dame Christine should have been acquainted\r\nwith the Sibylline poems; for it is known that she was well versed in\r\nthe writings of the ancients. But we perceive that the obviously\r\nmutilated prophecy of Merlin the Magician and the apocryphal\r\nchronogram of the Venerable Bede had come under her notice. The\r\npredictions and verses of the Armagnac ecclesiastics were spread\r\nabroad everywhere with amazing rapidity.[1667]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1667: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 133, 338, 340 _et seq._; vol. iv,\r\npp. 305, 480; vol. v, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nDame Christine's views concerning the Maid accord with those of the\r\ndoctors of the French party; and the poem she wrote in her convent in\r\nmany passages bears resemblance to the treatise of the Archbishop of\r\nEmbrun.\r\n\r\nThere it is said:\r\n\r\n\"The goodness of her life proves that Jeanne possesses the grace of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\"It was made manifest, when at the siege of Orleans her might revealed\r\nitself. Never was miracle plainer. God did so succour his own people,\r\nthat the strength of the enemy was but as that of a dead dog. They\r\nwere taken or slain.\r\n\r\n\"Honour to the feminine sex, God loves it. A damsel of sixteen, who is\r\nnot weighed down by armour and weapons, even though she be bred to\r\nendure hardness, is not that a matter beyond nature? The enemy flees\r\nbefore her. Many eyes behold it.\r\n\r\n\"She goeth forth capturing towns and castles. She is the first captain\r\nof our host. Such power had not Hector or Achilles. But God, who leads\r\nher, does all.\r\n\r\n\"And you, ye men-at-arms, who suffer durance vile and risk your lives\r\nfor the right, be ye faithful: in heaven shall ye have reward and\r\nglory, for whosoever fighteth for the just cause, winneth Paradise.\r\n\r\n\"Know ye that by her the English shall be cast down, for it is the\r\nwill of God, who inclineth his ear to the voice of the good folk, whom\r\nthey desired to overthrow. The blood of the slain crieth against\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of her convent Dame Christine shares the hope common to\r\nevery noble soul; from the Maid she expects all the good things she\r\nlongs for. She believes that Jeanne will restore concord to the\r\nChristian Church. The gentlest spirits of those days looked to fire\r\nand sword for the bringing in of unity and obedience; they never\r\ndreamed that Christian charity could mean charity towards the whole\r\nhuman race. Wherefore, on the strength of prophecy, the poetess\r\nexpects the Maid to destroy the infidel and the heretic, or in other\r\nwords the Turk and the Hussite.\r\n\r\n\"In her conquest of the Holy Land, she will tear up the Saracens like\r\nweeds. Thither will she lead King Charles, whom God defend! Before he\r\ndies he shall make that journey. He it is who shall conquer the land.\r\nThere shall she end her life. There shall the thing come to pass.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Christine would appear to have brought her poem to this\r\nconclusion when she received tidings of the King's coronation. She\r\nthen added thirteen stanzas to celebrate the mystery of Reims and to\r\nforetell the taking of Paris.[1668]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1668: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 3 _et seq._ R. Thomassy, _Essai sur\r\nles ecrits politiques de Christine de Pisan, suivi d'une notice\r\nlitteraire et de pieces inedites_, Paris, 1838, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThus in the gloom and silence of one of those convents where even the\r\nhushed noises of the world penetrated but seldom, this virtuous lady\r\ncollected and expressed in rhyme all those dreams of church and state\r\nwhich centred round a child.\r\n\r\nIn a fairly good ballad written at the time of the coronation, in love\r\nand honour \"of the beautiful garden of the noble flowers de luce,\"[1669]\r\nand for the elevation of the white cross, King Charles VII is\r\ndescribed by that mysterious name \"the noble stag,\" which we have\r\nfirst discovered in Christine's poem. The unknown author of the ballad\r\nsays that the Sibyl, daughter of King Priam, prophesied the\r\nmisfortunes of this royal stag; but such a prediction need not\r\nsurprise us, when we remember that Charles of Valois was of Priam's\r\nroyal line, wherefore Cassandra, when she revealed the destiny of the\r\nFlying Hart, did but prolong down the centuries the vicissitudes of\r\nher own family.[1670]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1669: _Du beau jardin des nobles fleurs de lis._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1670: M. Pierre Champion has kindly communicated to me the\r\ntext of this unpublished ballad, which he discovered in a French MS.\r\nat Stockholm, LIII, fol. 238. This is the title which the copyist\r\naffixed to it about 1472: _Ballade faicte quant le Roy Charles\r\nVII'eme fut couronne a Rains du temps de Jehanne daiz dicte la\r\nPucelle_.]\r\n\r\nRhymers on the French side celebrated the unexpected victories of\r\nCharles and the Maid as best they knew how, in a commonplace fashion,\r\nby some stiff poem but scantily clothing a thin and meagre muse.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there is a ballad,[1671] by a Dauphinois poet, beginning\r\nwith this line; \"Back, English _coues_, back!\"[1672] which is powerful\r\nthrough the genuine religious spirit which prevails throughout. The\r\nauthor, some poor ecclesiastic, points piously to the English banner\r\ncast down, \"by the will of King Jesus and of Jeanne the sweet\r\nMaid.\"[1673]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1671: P.

For example it was found that Engelide, daughter of an old\r\nKing of Hungary,[1675] had known long before of the coronation at Reims.\r\nIndeed to this royal virgin was attributed a prophecy recorded in\r\nLatin, of which the following is a literal translation:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1674: For the legend cf. _Merlin, roman en prose du XIII'e\r\nsiecle_, ed.

Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et\r\nconsultations_, p. 402.]\r\n\r\n\"O Lily illustrious, watered by princes, by the sower planted in the\r\nopen, in an orchard delectable, by flowers and sweet-smelling roses\r\nsurrounded. But, alas! dismay of the Lily, terror of the orchard!\r\nSundry beasts, some coming from without, others nourished within the\r\norchard, hurtling horns against horns, have well nigh crushed the\r\nLily, which fades for lack of water. Long do they trample upon it,\r\ndestroying nearly all its roots and assaying to wither it with their\r\npoisoned breath.\r\n\r\n\"But the beasts shall be driven forth in shame from the orchard, by a\r\nvirgin coming from the land whence flows the cruel venom. Behind her\r\nright ear the Virgin bears a little scarlet sign; she speaks softly,\r\nand her neck is short. To the Lily shall she give fountains of living\r\nwater, and shall drive out the serpent, to all men revealing its\r\nvenom. With a laurel wreath woven by no mortal hand shall she at Reims\r\nengarland happily the gardener of the Lily, named Charles, son of\r\nCharles. All around the turbulent neighbours shall submit, the waters\r\nshall surge, the folk shall cry: 'Long live the Lily! Away with the\r\nbeast! Let the orchard flower!' He shall approach the fields of the\r\nIsland, adding fleet to fleet, and there a multitude of beasts shall\r\nperish in the rout. Peace for many shall be established. The keys of a\r\ngreat number shall recognise the hand that had forged them. The\r\ncitizens of a noble city shall be punished for perjury by defeat,\r\ngroaning with many groans, and at the entrance [of Charles?] high\r\nwalls shall fall low. Then the orchard of the Lily shall be ... (?)\r\nand long shall it flower.\"[1676]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1676: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 344, 345.]\r\n\r\nThis prophecy attributed to the unknown daughter of a distant king\r\nwould seem to us to proceed from a French ecclesiastic and an\r\nArmagnac. French royalty is portrayed in the figure of the delectable\r\norchard, around which contend beasts nourished in the orchard as well\r\nas foreign beasts, that is Burgundians and English. King Charles of\r\nValois is mentioned by his own name and that of his father, and the\r\nname of the coronation town occurs in full.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of certain towns by their liege lord is stated most\r\nclearly. Doubtless the prediction was made at the very time of the\r\ncoronation. It explicitly mentions deeds already accomplished and\r\ndimly hints at events looked for, fulfilment of which was delayed, or\r\nhappened in a manner other than what was expected, or never happened\r\nat all, such as the taking of Paris after a terrible assault, the\r\ninvasion of England by the French, the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that when announcing that the deliverer of the\r\norchard might be recognised by her short neck, her sweet voice and a\r\nlittle scarlet mark, the pseudo Engelide was carefully depicting\r\ncharacteristics noticeable in Jeanne herself. Moreover we know that\r\nIsabelle Romee's daughter had a sweet woman's voice.[1677] That her neck\r\nwas broad and firmly set on her shoulders accords with what is known\r\nconcerning her robust appearance.[1678] And doubtless the so-called\r\ndaughter of the King of Hungary did not imagine the birth-mark behind\r\nher right ear.[1679]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1677: Philippe de Bergame, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 523; vol.\r\nv, pp. 108, 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1678: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 100.

The inhabitants gave\r\nthem to wit that they inclined to favour the Flowers de Luce.[1680]\r\nHenceforth the submission of Compiegne was sure. The King summoned the\r\ncitizens to receive him; on Wednesday the 18th, the keys of the town\r\nwere brought to him; on the next day he entered.[1681] The Attorneys[1682]\r\n(for by that name the aldermen of the town were called) presented to\r\nhim Messire Guillaume de Flavy, whom they had elected governor of\r\ntheir town, as being their most experienced and most faithful citizen.\r\nOn his being presented they asked the King, according to their\r\nprivilege, to confirm and ratify his appointment. But the sire de la\r\nTremouille took for himself the governorship of Compiegne and\r\nappointed as his lieutenant Messire Guillaume de Flavy, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding, the inhabitants regarded as their captain.[1683]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1680: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 328. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 18.

He charged the\r\nfolk of Beauvais to acknowledge him as their lord. When they saw the\r\nflowers-de-luce borne by the heralds, the citizens cried: \"Long live\r\nCharles of France!\" The clergy chanted a _Te Deum_ and there was great\r\nrejoicing. Those who refused fealty to King Charles were put out of\r\nthe town with permission to take away their possessions.[1684] The\r\nBishop and Vidame of Beauvais, Messire Pierre Cauchon, who was Grand\r\nAlmoner of France to King Henry, and a negotiator of important\r\necclesiastical business, grieved to see his city returning to the\r\nFrench;[1685] it was to the city's hurt, but he could not help it. He\r\nfailed not to realise that part of this disgrace he owed to the Maid\r\nof the Armagnacs, who was influential with her party and had the\r\nreputation of being all powerful. As he was a good theologian he must\r\nhave suspected that the devil was leading her and he wished her all\r\npossible harm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1684: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 327. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 118.

Had King Charles gone there\r\nthe majority of the dwellers in the strong towers and castles of\r\nPicardy would have received him as their sovereign.[1686] But meanwhile\r\nhis enemies would have recaptured what he had just won in Valois and\r\nthe Ile de France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1686: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 354.]\r\n\r\nHaving entered Compiegne with the King, Jeanne lodged at the Hotel du\r\nBoeuf, the house of the King's proctor. She slept with the proctor's\r\nwife, Marie Le Boucher, who was a kinswoman of Jacques Boucher,\r\nTreasurer of Orleans.[1687]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1687: A. Sorel, _Sejours de Jeanne d'Arc a Compiegne_, p. 6.]\r\n\r\nShe longed to march on Paris, which she was sure of taking since her\r\nVoices had promised it to her. It is related that at the end of two or\r\nthree days she grew impatient, and, calling the Duke of Alencon, said\r\nto him: \"My fair Duke, command your men and likewise those of the\r\nother captains to equip themselves,\" then she is said to have cried:\r\n\"By my staff! I must to Paris.\"[1688] But this could not have happened:\r\nthe Maid never gave orders to the men-at-arms. The truth of the matter\r\nis that the Duke of Alencon, with a goodly company of fighting men,\r\ntook his leave of the King and that Jeanne was to accompany him. She\r\nwas ready to mount her horse when on Monday the 22nd of August, a\r\nmessenger from the Count of Armagnac brought her a letter which she\r\ncaused to be read to her.[1689] The following are the contents of the\r\nmissive:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1688: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 164, 165. _Chronique de Tournai_,\r\nvol. iii, in the _Recueil des chroniques de Flandre_, ed. Smedt, p.\r\n414.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1689: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 82, 83.]\r\n\r\n     \"My very dear Lady, I commend myself humbly to you, and I\r\n     entreat you, for God's sake, that seeing the divisions which\r\n     are at present in the holy Church Universal, concerning the\r\n     question of the popes (for there are three contending for\r\n     the papacy: one dwells at Rome and calls himself Martin V,\r\n     whom all Christian kings obey: the other dwells at\r\n     Peniscola, in the kingdom of Valentia, and calls himself\r\n     Clement VIII; the third dwells no man knows where, unless it\r\n     be the Cardinal de Saint-Estienne and a few folk with him,\r\n     and calls himself Pope Benedict XIV; the first, who is\r\n     called Pope Martin, was elected at Constance by consent of\r\n     all Christian nations; he who is called Clement was elected\r\n     at Peniscola, after the death of Pope Benedict XIII, by\r\n     three of his cardinals; the third who is called Pope\r\n     Benedict XIV was elected secretly at Peniscola, by that same\r\n     Cardinal Saint-Estienne himself): I pray you beseech Our\r\n     Lord Jesus Christ that in his infinite mercy, he declare\r\n     unto us through you, which of the three aforesaid is the\r\n     true pope and whom it shall be his pleasure that henceforth\r\n     we obey, him who is called Martin, or him who is called\r\n     Clement or him who is called Benedict; and in whom we should\r\n     believe, either in secret or under reservation or by public\r\n     pronouncement: for we shall all be ready to work the will\r\n     and the pleasure of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n     Yours in all things,\r\n\r\n     COUNT D'ARMAGNAC.\"[1690]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1690: _Ibid._, pp. 245, 246.]\r\n\r\nHe who wrote thus, calling Jeanne his very dear lady, recommending\r\nhimself humbly to her, not in self-abasement, but merely, as we should\r\nsay to-day, out of courtesy, was one of the greater vassals of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen this baron, and doubtless she had never heard of\r\nhim. Jean IV, son of that Constable of France who had been killed in\r\n1418, was the cruellest man in the kingdom. At that time he was\r\nbetween thirty-three and thirty-four years of age. He held both\r\nArmagnacs, the Black and the White, the country of the Four Valleys,\r\nthe counties of Pardiac, of Fesenzac, Astarac, La Lomagne, and\r\nl'Ile-Jourdain. After the Count of Foix he was the most powerful noble\r\nof Gascony.[1691]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1691: A. Longnon, _Les limites de la France et l'etendue de la\r\ndomination anglaise a l'epoque de la mission de Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris,\r\n1875, in 8vo. Vallet de Viriville, in _Nouvelle biographie generale_,\r\niii, col. 255, 257.]\r\n\r\nWhile his name was among those of the adherents of the King and while\r\nit was used to designate those who were hostile to the English and\r\nBurgundians, Jean IV himself was neither French nor English, but\r\nsimply Gascon. He called himself count by the grace of God, but he was\r\never ready to acknowledge himself the King's vassal when it was a\r\nquestion of receiving gifts from that suzerain, who might not always\r\nbe able to afford himself new gaiters, but who must perforce spend\r\nlarge sums on his great vassals. Meanwhile Jean IV showed\r\nconsideration to the English, protected an adventurer in the Regent's\r\npay, and gave appointments in his household to men wearing the red\r\ncross. He was as violent and treacherous as any of his retainers.\r\nHaving unlawfully seized the Marshal de Severac, he exacted from him\r\nthe cession of all his goods and then had him strangled.[1692]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1692: _Chronique de Mathieu d'Escouchy_, vol. i, p. 68, and\r\nproofs and illustrations, pp. 126, 128, 139, 140.

And now we have the docile son of Holy\r\nChurch appearing eager to discover who is his true spiritual father.\r\nIt would seem, however, that his mind was already made up on the\r\nsubject and that he already knew the answer to his question. In verity\r\nthe long schism, which had rent Christendom asunder, had terminated\r\ntwelve years earlier. It had ended when the Conclave, which had\r\nassembled at Constance in the House of the Merchants on the 8th of\r\nNovember, 1417, on the 11th of that month, Saint Martin's Day,\r\nproclaimed Pope, the Cardinal Deacon Otto Colonna, who assumed the\r\ntitle of Martin V. In the Eternal City Martin V wore that tiara which\r\nLorenzo Ghiberti had adorned with eight figures in gold;[1693] and the\r\nwily Roman had contrived to obtain his recognition by England and even\r\nby France, who thenceforward renounced all hope of a French pontiff.\r\nWhile Charles VII's advisers may not have agreed with Martin V on the\r\nquestion of a General Council, all the rights of the Pope of Rome in\r\nthe Kingdom of France had been restored to him by an edict, in 1425.\r\nMartin V was the one and only pope. Nevertheless, Alphonso of Aragon,\r\nhighly incensed because Martin V supported against him the rights of\r\nLouis d'Anjou to the Kingdom of Naples, determined to oppose to the\r\nPope of Rome a pontiff of his own making. And just ready to hand he\r\nhad a canon who called himself pope, and on the following grounds:\r\nthe Anti-pope, Benedict XIII, having fled to Peniscola, had on his\r\ndeath-bed nominated four cardinals, three of whom appointed to succeed\r\nhim a canon of Barcelona, one Gil Munoz, who assumed the title of\r\nClement VIII. Imprisoned in the chateau of Peniscola on a barren neck\r\nof land on three sides washed by the sea, this was the Clement whom\r\nthe King of Aragon had chosen to be the rival of Martin V.[1694]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1693: _Annales juris pontificis_ (1872-1875), vii, 385.

The Count of Armagnac joined the King's party.\r\nFor the baptism of his children the Count had holy water blessed by\r\nBenedict XIII brought from Peniscola. He likewise was excommunicated.\r\nThe blow had fallen upon him in this very year, 1429. Thus for some\r\nmonths he had been deprived of the sacraments and excluded from public\r\nworship. Hence arose all manner of secular difficulties, in addition\r\nto which he was probably afraid of the devil.\r\n\r\nMoreover his position was becoming impossible. His powerful ally, King\r\nAlfonso, gave in, and himself called upon Clement VIII to resign. When\r\nhe addressed his inquiry to the Maid of France, the Armagnac was\r\nevidently meditating the withdrawal of his allegiance from an\r\nunfortunate anti-pope, who was himself renouncing or about to renounce\r\nthe tiara; for Clement VIII abdicated at Peniscola on the 26th of\r\nJuly. The dictation of the Count's letter cannot have occurred long\r\nbefore that date and may have been after. At any rate whenever he\r\ndictated it he must have been aware of the position of the Sovereign\r\nPontiff Clement VIII.\r\n\r\nAs for the third Pope mentioned in his missive, Benedict XIV, he had\r\nno tidings of him, and indeed he was keeping very quiet. His election\r\nto the Holy See had been singular in that it had been made by one\r\ncardinal alone. Benedict XIV's right to the papacy had been\r\ncommunicated to him by a cardinal created by the Anti-pope, Benedict\r\nXIII, at the time of his promotion in 1409. That Cardinal was Jean\r\nBarrere, a Frenchman, Bachelor of laws, priest and Cardinal of\r\nSaint-Etienne _in Coelio monte_. It was not to Benedict XIV that the\r\nArmagnac was thinking of giving his allegiance; obviously he was eager\r\nto submit to Martin V.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy therefore to discover why he should have asked Jeanne\r\nto indicate the true pope. Doubtless it was customary in those days to\r\nconsult on all manner of questions those holy maids to whom God\r\nvouchsafed illumination. Such an one the Maid appeared, and her fame\r\nas a prophetess had been spread abroad in a very short time. She\r\nrevealed hidden things, she drew the curtain from the future. We are\r\nreminded of that _capitoul_[1695] of Toulouse, who about three weeks\r\nafter the deliverance of Orleans, advised her being consulted as to a\r\nremedy for the corruption of the coinage. Bona of Milan, married to a\r\npoor gentleman in the train of her cousin, Queen Ysabeau, besought the\r\nMaid's help in her endeavour to regain the duchy which she claimed\r\nthrough her descent from the Visconti.[1696] It was just as appropriate\r\nto question the Maid concerning the Pope and the Anti-pope. But the\r\nmost difficult point in this question is to discover what were the\r\nCount of Armagnac's reasons for consulting the Holy Maid on a matter\r\nconcerning which he appears to have been sufficiently informed. The\r\nfollowing seems the most probable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1695: Cf. vol. i, p. 337 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1696: According to Le Maire, _Histoire et antiquites de la\r\nville et duche d'Orleans_, p. 197, this request is addressed to\r\n\"Jeanne the Maid, greatly to be honoured and most devout, sent by the\r\nKing of Heaven for the restoration, and for the extirpation of the\r\nEnglish who tyrannize over France.\" _Trial_, vol. v, p. 253. Vallet de\r\nViriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p. 131.]\r\n\r\nJean IV was prepared to recognise Martin V as Pope; but he desired his\r\nsubmission to appear honourable and reasonable. Wherefore he conceived\r\nthe idea of ascribing his conduct to the command of Jesus Christ,\r\nspeaking through the Holy Maid. But it was necessary for the command\r\nto be in accordance with his wishes. The letter provides for that. He\r\nis careful to indicate to Jeanne, and consequently to God, what reply\r\nwould be suitable. He lays stress on the fact that Martin V, who had\r\nrecently excommunicated him, was elected at Constance by the consent\r\nof all Christian nations, that he dwells at Rome and that he is obeyed\r\nby all Christian kings. He points out on the other hand the\r\ncircumstances which invalidate the election of Clement VIII by only\r\nthree cardinals, and the still more ridiculous election of that\r\nBenedict, who was chosen by a conclave consisting of only one\r\ncardinal.[1697]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1697: Noel Valois, _La France et le grand schisme d'Occident_,\r\nvol. iv (1902), in 8vo, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nAfter such a setting forth could there possibly remain a single doubt\r\nas to whether Pope Martin was the true pope? But such guile was lost\r\non Jeanne; it escaped her entirely. The Count of Armagnac's letter,\r\nwhich she had read to her as she was mounting her horse, must have\r\nstruck her as very obscure.[1698] The names of Benedict, of Clement and\r\nof Martin she had never heard. The Saints, Catherine and Margaret,\r\nwith whom she was constantly holding converse, revealed to her nothing\r\nconcerning the Pope. They spoke to her of nought save of the realm of\r\nFrance; and Jeanne's prudence generally led her to confine her\r\nprophecies to the subject of the war. This circumstance was pointed\r\nout by a German clerk as a matter extraordinary and worthy of\r\nnote.[1699] But for this once she consented to reply to Jean IV, in\r\norder to maintain her reputation as a prophet and because the title of\r\nArmagnac strongly appealed to her. She told him that at that moment\r\nshe was unable to instruct him concerning the true pope, but that\r\nlater she would inform him in which of the three he must believe,\r\naccording as God should reveal it unto her. In short, she in a measure\r\nfollowed the example of such soothsayers as postpone the announcement\r\nof the oracle to a future day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1698: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1699: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 466, 467.]\r\n\r\n     Jhesus [cross symbol] Maria\r\n\r\n     Count of Armagnac, my good friend and beloved, Jehanne the\r\n     Maid lets you to wit that your message hath come before me,\r\n     the which hath told me that you have sent from where you are\r\n     to know from me in which of the three popes, whom you\r\n     mention in your memorial, you ought to believe. This thing\r\n     in sooth I cannot tell you truly for the present, until I be\r\n     in Paris or at rest elsewhere, because for the present I am\r\n     too much hindered by affairs of war; but when you hear that\r\n     I am in Paris send a message to me, and I will give you to\r\n     understand what you shall rightfully believe, and what I\r\n     shall know by the counsel of my Righteous and Sovereign\r\n     Lord, the King of all the world, and what you should do, as\r\n     far as I may. To God I commend you; God keep you. Written at\r\n     Compiengne, the 22nd day of August.[1700]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1700: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 245, 246.]\r\n\r\nJeanne before she made this reply can have consulted neither the good\r\nBrother Pasquerel nor the good Friar Richard nor indeed any of the\r\nchurchmen of her company. They would have told her that the true pope\r\nwas the Pope of Rome, Martin V. They might also have represented to\r\nher that she was belittling the authority of the Church by appealing\r\nto a revelation from God concerning popes and anti-popes. Sometimes,\r\nthey would have told her, God confides the secrets of his Church to\r\nholy persons. But it would be rash to count upon so rare a privilege.\r\n\r\nJeanne exchanged a few words with the messenger who had brought her\r\nthe missive; but the interview was brief. The messenger was not safe\r\nin the town, not that the soldiers would have made him pay for his\r\nmaster's crimes and treasons; but the Sire de la Tremouille was at\r\nCompiegne; and he knew that Count Jean, who for the nonce was in\r\nalliance with the Constable De Richemont, was meditating something\r\nagainst him. La Tremouille was not so malevolent as the Count of\r\nArmagnac: and yet the poor messenger only narrowly escaped being\r\nthrown into the Oise.[1701]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1701: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Tuesday the 23rd of August, the Maid and the Duke of\r\nAlencon took leave of the King and set out from Compiegne with a\r\ngoodly company of fighting men. Before marching on Saint-Denys in\r\nFrance, they went to Senlis to collect a company of men-at-arms whom\r\nthe King had sent there.[1702] As was her custom, the Maid rode\r\nsurrounded by monks. Friar Richard, who predicted the approaching end\r\nof the world, had joined the procession. It would seem that he had\r\nsuperseded the others, even Brother Pasquerel, the chaplain. It was to\r\nhim that the Maid confessed beneath the walls of Senlis. In that same\r\nspot, with the Dukes of Clermont and Alencon,[1703] she took the\r\ncommunion on two consecutive days. She must have been in the hands of\r\nmonks who were in the habit of making a very frequent use of the\r\nEucharist.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1702: Perceval de Cagny, p. 165. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 331.

Hitherto, he had been on\r\nthe side of the English and entirely devoted to the Lord Bishop of\r\nBeauvais. On the approach of the royal army, Jean Fouquerel, who was a\r\ncautious person, had gone off to Paris to hide a large sum of money.\r\nHe was careful of his possessions. Some one in the army took his nag\r\nand gave it to the Maid. By means of a draft on the receiver of taxes\r\nand the _gabelle_ officer of the town, two hundred golden\r\n_saluts_[1704] were paid for it. The Lord Bishop did not approve of\r\nthis transaction and demanded his hackney. Hearing of his displeasure,\r\nthe Maid caused a letter to be written to him, saying that he might\r\nhave back his nag if he liked; she did not want it for she found it\r\nnot sufficiently hardy for men-at-arms. The horse was sent to the Sire\r\nde La Tremouille with a request that he would deliver it to the Lord\r\nBishop, who never received it.[1705]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1704: So called because stamped with the picture of the\r\nAnnunciation and bearing the inscription: _Salus populi suprema lex\r\nest_; the coin was worth about L1 of our money (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1705: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 104.

Jeanne was not at fault,\r\nand yet the Lord Bishop of Beauvais and the clerks of the university\r\nwere shortly to bring home to her the gravity of the sacrilege of\r\nlaying hands on an ecclesiastical hackney.[1706]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1706: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 264.]\r\n\r\nTo the north of Paris, about five miles distant from the great city,\r\nthere rose the towers of Saint-Denys. On the 26th of August, the army\r\nof the Duke of Alencon arrived there, and entered without resistance,\r\nalbeit the town was strongly fortified.[1707] The place was famous for\r\nits illustrious abbey very rich and very ancient. The following is the\r\nstory of its foundation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1707: Perceval de Cagny, p. 165. The 25th according to _Le\r\njournal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nDagobert, King of the French, had from childhood been a devout\r\nworshipper of Saint Denys. And whenever he trembled before the ire of\r\nKing Clotaire his father, he would take refuge in the church of the\r\nholy martyr. When he died, a pious man dreamed that he saw Dagobert\r\nsummoned before the tribunal of God; a great number of saints accused\r\nhim of having despoiled their churches; and the demons were about to\r\ndrag him into hell when Saint Denys appeared; and by his intercession,\r\nthe soul of the King was delivered and escaped punishment. The story\r\nwas held to be true, and it was thought that the King's soul returned\r\nto animate his body and that he did penance.[1708]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1708: J. Doublet, _Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denys en\r\nFrance, contenant les antiquites d'icelle, les fondations,\r\nprerogatives et privileges_, Paris, 1625, 2 vol. in 4to, vol. i, ch.\r\nxx and xxiv. Des Rues, _Les antiquites, fondations et singularites des\r\nplus celebres villes_, pp. 84, 85.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Maid with the army occupied Saint-Denys, the three porches,\r\nthe embattled parapets, the tower of the Abbey Church, erected by the\r\nAbbot Suger, were already three centuries old. There were buried the\r\nkings of France; and thither they came to take the _oriflamme_.\r\nFourteen years earlier the late King Charles had fetched it forth, but\r\nsince then none had borne it.[1709]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1709: J. Doublet, _Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denys_, vol.\r\ni, ch. xxxi, xxxiv.]\r\n\r\nMany were the wonders told touching this royal standard. And with some\r\nof those marvels the Maid must needs have been acquainted, since on\r\nher coming into France, she was said to have given the Dauphin Charles\r\nthe surname of _oriflamme_,[1710] as a pledge and promise of\r\nvictory.[1711] At Saint-Denys was preserved the heart of the Constable\r\nDu Guesclin.[1712] Jeanne had heard of his high renown; she had\r\nproffered wine to Madame de Laval's eldest son; and to his\r\ngrandmother, who had been Sire Bertrand's second wife, she had sent a\r\nlittle ring of gold, out of respect for the widow of so valiant a\r\nman,[1713] asking her to forgive the poverty of the gift.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1710: Cf. vol. i, p. 182 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1711: Thomassin, _Registre Delphinal_, in _Trial_, vol. iv,\r\np. 304.

There likewise was to be\r\nseen the head of Saint Denys. True, at the same time one was being\r\nshown in the Cathedral church of Paris. The Chancellor, Jean Gerson,\r\ntreating of Jeanne the Maid, a few days before his death, wrote that\r\nof her it might be said as of the head of Saint Denys, that belief in\r\nher was a matter of edification and not of faith, albeit in both\r\nplaces alike the head ought to be worshipped in order that edification\r\nshould not be turned into scandal.[1714]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1714: D.

Jeanne must joyously have\r\nwondered at the insignia, the symbols and signs of the royalty of the\r\nLilies gathered together in this spot,[1715] if indeed those eyes,\r\noccupied with celestial visions, had leisure to perceive the things of\r\nearth, and if her Voices, endlessly whispering in her ear, left her\r\none moment's respite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1715: _Religieux de Saint-Denis_, pp. 154, 156, 226.]\r\n\r\nSaint Denys was a great saint, since there was no doubt of his being\r\nin very deed the Areopagite himself.[1716] But since he had permitted\r\nhis abbey to be taken he was no longer invoked as the patron saint of\r\nthe Kings of France. The Dauphin's followers had replaced him by the\r\nBlessed Archangel Michael, whose abbey, near the city of Avranches,\r\nhad victoriously held out against the English. It was Saint Michael\r\nnot Saint Denys who had appeared to Jeanne in the garden at Domremy;\r\nbut she knew that Saint Denys was the war cry of France.[1717]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1716: Estienne Binet, _La vie apostolique de saint Denys\r\nl'Areopagite, patron et apostre de la France_, Paris, 1624, in 12mo.\r\nJ.

Havet, _Les origines de Saint-Denis_, in _Les Questions\r\nmerovingiennes_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1717: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 179.]\r\n\r\nThe monks of that rich abbey wasted by war lived there in poverty and\r\nin disorder.[1718] Armagnacs and Burgundians in turn descended upon the\r\nneighbouring fields and villages, plundering and ravaging, leaving\r\nnought that it was possible to carry off. At Saint-Denys was held the\r\nFair of Le Lendit, one of the greatest in Christendom. But now\r\nMerchants had ceased to attend it. At the Lendit of 1418, there were\r\nbut three booths, and those for the selling of shoes from Brabant, in\r\nthe high street of Saint-Denys, near the Convent of Les Filles-Dieu.\r\nSince 1426, there had been no fair at all.[1719]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1718: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 179, note 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1719: _Ibid._, pp. 101, 209, note 1.]\r\n\r\nAt the tidings that the Armagnacs were approaching Troyes, the\r\npeasants had cut their corn before it was ripe and brought it into\r\nParis. On entering Saint-Denys, the Duke of Alencon's men-at-arms\r\nfound the town deserted. The chief burgesses had taken refuge in\r\nParis.[1720] Only a few of the poorer families were left. The Maid\r\nheld two newly born infants over the baptismal font.[1721]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1720: _Ibid._, pp. 241, 242. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 354.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1721: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nHearing of these Saint-Denys baptisms, her enemies accused her of\r\nhaving lit candles and held them inclined over the infant's heads, in\r\norder that she might read their destinies in the melted wax. It was\r\nnot the first time, it appeared, that she indulged in such practices.\r\nWhen she entered a town, little children were said to offer her\r\ncandles kneeling, and she received them as an agreeable sacrifice.\r\nThen upon the heads of these innocents she would let fall three drops\r\nof burning wax, proclaiming that by virtue of this ceremony they could\r\nnot fail to be good. In such acts Burgundian ecclesiastics discerned\r\nidolatry and witchcraft, in which was likewise involved heresy.[1722]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1722: _Ibid._, p. 304. Noel Valois, _Un nouveau temoignage\r\nsur Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Annuaire-bulletin de la Societe de l'Histoire\r\nde France_, Paris, 1907, in 8vo, separate issue, pp. 17, 18.]\r\n\r\nHere again, at Saint-Denys, she distributed banners to the\r\nmen-at-arms. Churchmen on the English side strongly suspected her of\r\ncharming those banners. And as everyone in those days believed in\r\nmagic, such a suspicion was not without its danger.[1723]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1723: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid and the Duke of Alencon lost no time. Immediately after their\r\narrival at Saint-Denys they went forth to skirmish before the gates of\r\nParis. Two or three times a day they engaged in this desultory\r\nwarfare, notably by the wind-mill at the Saint-Denys Gate and in the\r\nvillage of La Chapelle. \"Every day there was booty taken,\" says\r\nMessire Jean de Bueil.[1724] It seems hardly credible that in a country\r\nwhich had been plundered and ravaged over and over again, there\r\nshould have been anything left to be taken; and yet the statement is\r\nmade and attested by one of the nobles in the army.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1724: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p. 281.]\r\n\r\nOut of respect for the seventh commandment, the Maid forbade the men\r\nof her company to commit any theft whatsoever. And she always refused\r\nvictuals offered her when she knew they had been stolen. In reality\r\nshe, like the others, lived on pillage, but she did not know it. One\r\nday when a Scotsman gave her to wit that she had just partaken of some\r\nstolen veal, she flew into a fury and would have beaten him: saintly\r\nwomen are subject to such fits of passion.[1725]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1725: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 81.]\r\n\r\nJeanne is said to have observed the walls of Paris carefully, seeking\r\nthe spot most favourable for attack.[1726] The truth is that in this\r\nmatter as in all others she depended on her Voices. For the rest she\r\nwas far superior to all the men-at-arms in courage and in good will.\r\nFrom Saint-Denys she sent the King message after message, urging him\r\nto come and take Paris.[1727] But at Compiegne the King and his Council\r\nwere negotiating with the ambassadors of the Duke of Burgundy, to wit:\r\nJean de Luxembourg, Lord of Beaurevoir, Hugues de Cayeux, Bishop of\r\nArras, David de Brimeu and my Lord of Charny.[1728]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1726: Perceval de Cagny, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1727: _Ibid._, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1728: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, p. 112. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, pp. 404,\r\n408. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 192; vol. iv, appendix xviii.]\r\n\r\nThe fifteen days' truce had expired. Our only information concerning\r\nit is contained in Jeanne's letter to the citizens of Reims. According\r\nto Jeanne, the Duke of Burgundy had undertaken to surrender the city\r\nto the King of France on the fifteenth day.[1729] If he had so agreed\r\nit was on conditions of which we know nothing; we are not therefore in\r\na position to say whether or no those conditions had been carried out.\r\nThe Maid placed no trust in this promise, and she was quite right; but\r\nshe did not know everything; and on the very day when she was\r\ncomplaining of the truce to the citizens of Reims, Duke Philip was\r\nreceiving the command of Paris at the hands of the Regent, and was\r\nhenceforth in a position to dispose of the city as he liked.[1730] Duke\r\nPhilip could not bear the sight of Charles of Valois, who had been\r\npresent at the murder on the Bridge of Montereau, but he detested the\r\nEnglish and wished they would go to the devil or return to their\r\nisland. The vineyards and the cloth looms of his dominions were too\r\nnumerous and too important for him not to wish for peace. He had no\r\ndesire to be King of France; therefore he could be treated with,\r\ndespite his avarice and dissimulation. Nevertheless the fifteenth day\r\nhad gone by and the city of Paris remained in the hands of the English\r\nand the Burgundians, who were not friends but allies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1729: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1730: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 332. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 106. P. Cochon, p. 457. Perceval de Cagny, p.\r\n165.]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August a truce was concluded. It was to last till\r\nChristmas and was to extend over the whole country north of the Seine,\r\nfrom Nogent to Harfleur, with the exception of such towns as were\r\nsituated where there was a passage over the river. Concerning the city\r\nof Paris it was expressly stated that \"Our Cousin of Burgundy, he and\r\nhis men, may engage in the defence of the town and in resisting such\r\nas shall make war upon it or do it hurt.\"[1731] The Chancellor\r\nRegnault de Chartres, the Sire de la Tremouille, Christophe\r\nd'Harcourt, the Bastard of Orleans, the Bishop of Seez, and likewise\r\ncertain young nobles very eager for war, such as the Counts of\r\nClermont and of Vendome and the Duke of Bar, in short all the\r\nCounsellors of the King and the Princes of the Blood who signed this\r\narticle, were apparently giving the enemy a weapon against them and\r\nrenouncing any attempt upon Paris. But they were not all fools; the\r\nBastard of Orleans was keen witted and the Lord Archbishop of Reims\r\nwas anything but an Olibrius.[1732] They doubtless knew what they were\r\nabout when they recognised the Duke of Burgundy's rights over Paris.\r\nDuke Philip, as we know, had been governor of the great town since the\r\n13th of August. The Regent had ceded it with the idea that Burgundy\r\nwould keep the Parisians in order better than England, for the English\r\nwere few in number and were disliked as foreigners. What did it profit\r\nKing Charles to recognise his cousin's rights over Paris? We fail to\r\nsee precisely; but after all this truce was no better and no worse\r\nthan others. In sooth it did not give Paris to the King, but neither\r\ndid it prevent the King from taking it. Did truces ever hinder\r\nArmagnacs and Burgundians from fighting when they had a mind to fight?\r\nWas one of those frequent truces ever kept?[1733] After having signed\r\nthis one, the King advanced to Senlis. The Duke of Alencon came to him\r\nthere twice. Charles reached Saint-Denys on Wednesday the 7th of\r\nSeptember.[1734]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1731: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 352, 353. _Journal d'un\r\nbourgeois de Paris_, pp. 247, 248. D.

In all haste therefore they\r\nproceeded to put it in a state of defence; they surrounded it with\r\ntrenches and counter trenches. On the side of the University the\r\nsuburbs were left defenceless; small and remote, they were burned\r\ndown. But on the right bank the more extensive suburbs well nigh\r\ntouched the city. One part of them was enclosed by the trenches. When\r\npeace was concluded, Charles, Regent of the Realm, undertook to\r\nsurround the town on the north with an embattled wall, flanked with\r\nsquare towers, with terraces and parapets, with a road round and steps\r\nleading up to the ramparts.\r\n\r\nIn certain places the trench was single, in others double. The work\r\nwas superintended by Hugues Aubriot, Provost of Paris, to whom was\r\nentrusted also the building of the Saint-Antoine bastion, completed\r\nunder King Charles VI.[1735] This new fortification began on the east,\r\nnear the river, on the rising ground of Les Celestins. Within its\r\ncircle it enclosed the district of Saint Paul, the Culture\r\nSainte-Catherine, the Temple, Saint-Martin, Les Filles-Dieu, Saint\r\nSauveur, Saint Honore, Les Quinze Vingts, which hitherto had been in\r\nthe suburbs and undefended; and it reached the river below the Louvre,\r\nwhich was thus united to the town. There were six gates in the\r\ncircumvallation, to wit: beginning on the east, the Baudet Gate or\r\nSaint-Antoine Gate, the Saint-Avoye or Temple Gate, the Gate of the\r\nPainters or of Saint-Denis, the Saint-Martin or Montmartre Gate, the\r\nSaint-Honore Gate and the Gate of the Seine.[1736]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1735: Le Roux de Lincy, _Hugues Aubriot, prevot de Paris sous\r\nCharles V_, Paris, 1862, in 8vo, _passim_. _Paris et ses historiens au\r\nXIV'e et XV'e siecle_ by Le Roux de Lincy and Tisserand, Paris, in\r\nfol.

The folk murmured when, after the\r\nfuneral of the late King, Charles VI, the Duke of Bedford had the\r\nsword of the King of France borne before him.[1737] But what cannot be\r\nhelped must be endured. The Parisians may have disliked the English;\r\nthey admired Duke Philip, a prince of comely countenance and the\r\nrichest potentate of Christendom. As for the little King of Bourges,\r\nmean-looking and sad-faced, strongly suspected of treason at\r\nMontereau, there was nothing pleasing in him; he was despised and his\r\nfollowers were regarded with fear and horror. For ten years they had\r\nbeen ranging round the town, pillaging, taking prisoners and holding\r\nthem to ransom. The English and Burgundians indeed did likewise. When,\r\nin the August of 1423, Duke Philip came to Paris, his men ravaged all\r\nthe neighbouring fields, albeit they belonged to friends and allies.\r\nBut they were only passing through,[1738] while the Armagnacs were for\r\never raiding, eternally stealing all they could lay hands on, setting\r\nfire to barns and churches, killing women and children, ravishing\r\nmaids and nuns, hanging men by the thumbs. In 1420, like devils let\r\nloose, they descended upon the village of Champigny and burned at once\r\noats, wheat, sheep, cows, oxen, women and children. Likewise did they\r\nand worse still at Croissy.[1739] One ecclesiastic said they had caused\r\nmore Christians to suffer martyrdom than Maximian and Diocletian.[1740]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1737: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1738: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1739: _Ibid._, pp. 136, 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1740: _Ibid._, p. 107. _Document inedit relatif a l'etat de\r\nParis en 1430_, in _Revue des societes savantes_, 1863, p. 203.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in the year 1429, there might have been discovered in the\r\ncity of Paris not a few followers of the Dauphin. Christine de Pisan,\r\nwho was very loyal to the House of Valois, said: \"In Paris there are\r\nmany wicked. Good are there also and faithful to their King. But they\r\ndare not lift up their voices.\"[1741]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1741: Christine de Pisan, in _Trial_, vol. v, stanza 56, p.\r\n20. Le Roux de Lincy and Tisserand, _Paris et ses historiens_, p.\r\n426.]\r\n\r\nIt was common knowledge that in the Parlement and even in the Chapter\r\nof Notre-Dame were to be found those who had dealings with the\r\nArmagnacs.[1742]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1742: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 251. A. Longnon,\r\n_Paris pendant la domination anglaise (1420-1436), documents extraits\r\ndes registres de la chancellerie de France_, Paris, 1877, in 8vo,\r\nintroduction, p. xiij. Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 116, note 1.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of their victory at Patay, those terrible Armagnacs had\r\nonly to march straight on the town to take it. They were expected to\r\nenter it one day or the other. In the mind of the Regent it was as if\r\nthey had already taken it. He went off and shut himself in the Castle\r\nof Vincennes with the few men who remained to him.[1743] Three days\r\nafter the discomfiture of the English there was a panic in the town.\r\n\"The Armagnacs are coming to-night,\" they said. Meanwhile the\r\nArmagnacs were at Orleans awaiting orders to assemble at Gien and to\r\nmarch on Auxerre. At these tidings the Duke of Bedford must have\r\nsighed a deep sigh of relief; and straightway he set to work to\r\nprovide for the defence of Paris and the safety of Normandy.[1744]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1743: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 248. _Chronique\r\nde la Pucelle_, p. 297. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 79, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1744: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 257.\r\nFalconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 453. Morosini, vol. iii, p.\r\n198.]\r\n\r\nWhen the panic was past, the heart of the great town returned to its\r\nallegiance, not to the English cause--it had never been English--but\r\nto the Burgundian. Its Provost, Messire Simon Morhier, who had made\r\ngreat slaughter of the French at the Battle of the Herrings, remained\r\nloyal to the Leopard.[1745] The aldermen on the contrary were suspected\r\nof inclining a favourable ear to King Charles's proposals. On the\r\n12th of July, the Parisians elected a new town council composed of the\r\nmost zealous Burgundians they could find in commerce and on change. To\r\nbe provost of the merchants they appointed the treasurer, Guillaume\r\nSanguin, to whom the Duke of Burgundy owed more then seven thousand\r\n_livres tournois_[1746] and who had the Regent's jewels in his\r\nkeeping.[1747] Such an alteration was greatly to the detriment of King\r\nCharles, who preferred to win back his good towns by peaceful means\r\nrather than by force, and who relied more on negotiations with the\r\ncitizens than on cannon balls and stones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1745: _Journal du siege_, p. 38. Jean Chartier, _Chronique_,\r\nvol. i, pp. 106, 107. Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 454.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1746: See vol. i, p. 222, note 2 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1747: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 239, note 2. Le\r\nRoux de Lincy and Tisserand, _Paris et ses historiens_, pp. 340 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nJust in the nick of time the Regent surrendered the town to Duke\r\nPhilip, not, we may be sure, without many regrets for having recently\r\nrefused him Orleans. He realised that thus, by returning to its French\r\nallegiance, the chief city of the realm would make a more energetic\r\ndefense against the Dauphin's men. The Parisians' old liking for the\r\nmagnificent Duke would revive, and so would their old hatred of the\r\ndisinherited son of Madame Ysabeau. In the Palais de Justice the Duke\r\nread the story of his father's death, punctuated with complaints of\r\nArmagnac treason and violated treaties; he caused the blood of\r\nMontereau[1748] to cry to heaven; those who were present swore to be\r\nright loyal to him and to the Regent. On the following days the same\r\noath was taken by the regular and secular clergy.[1749]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1748: 14th July, 1429, _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp.\r\n240, 241. Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 240. Morosini, vol.\r\niii, p. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1749: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nBut the citizens were strengthened in their resistance more by their\r\nremembrance of Armagnac cruelty than by their affection for the fair\r\nDuke. A rumour ran and was believed by them that Messire Charles of\r\nValois had abandoned to his mercenaries the city and the citizens of\r\nall ranks, high and low, men and women, and that he intended to plough\r\nup the very ground on which Paris stood. Such a rumour represented him\r\nvery falsely; on all occasions he was pitiful and debonair; his\r\nCouncil had prudently converted the coronation campaign into an armed\r\nand peaceful procession. But the Parisians were incapable of judging\r\nsanely when the intentions of the King of France were concerned; and\r\nthey knew only too well that once their town was taken there would be\r\nnothing to prevent the Armagnacs from laying it waste with fire and\r\nsword.[1750]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1750: Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 356.]\r\n\r\nOne other circumstance intensified their fear and their dislike. When\r\nthey heard that Friar Richard, to whose sermons they had once listened\r\nso devoutly, was riding with the Dauphin's men and with his nimble\r\ntongue winning such good towns as Troyes in Champagne, they called\r\ndown upon him the malediction of God and his Saints. They tore from\r\ntheir caps the pewter medals engraved with the holy name of Jesus,\r\nwhich the good Brother had given them, and in their bitter hatred\r\ntowards him they returned straightway to the dice, bowls and draughts\r\nwhich they had renounced at his exhortation. With no less horror did\r\nthe Maid inspire them. It was said that she was acting the prophetess\r\nand uttering such words as: \"In very deed this or that shall come to\r\npass.\" \"With the Armagnacs is a creature in woman's form. What it is\r\nGod only knows,\" they cried. They spoke of her as a woman of ill\r\nfame.[1751] Among these enemies, there were those who filled them with\r\neven greater horror than pagans and Saracens--to wit: a monk and a\r\nmaid. They all took the cross of Saint Andrew.[1752]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1751: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1752: _Ibid._, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Dauphin had been away at his coronation an army had come\r\nfrom England into France. The Regent intended it to overrun Normandy.\r\nIn its march on Rouen he commanded it in person. The defence and ward\r\nof Paris he left to Louis of Luxembourg, Bishop of Therouanne,\r\nChancellor of France for the English, to the Sire de l'Isle-Adam,\r\nMarshal of France, Captain of Paris, to two thousand men-at-arms and\r\nto the Parisian train-bands. To the last were entrusted the defence of\r\nthe ramparts and the management of the artillery. They were commanded\r\nby twenty-four burgesses, called _quarteniers_ because they\r\nrepresented the twenty-four quarters of the city. From the end of July\r\nall danger of a surprise had been guarded against.[1753]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1753: Rymer, _Foedera_, May. _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p.\r\n332. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 355.

Prices immediately went up.[1755]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1755: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 243. Perceval de\r\nCagny, p. 166. _Chronique des cordeliers_, folio, 486 verso.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of September, the _quarteniers_, each one in his own\r\ndistrict, had the trenches set in order and the cannons mounted on\r\nwalls, gates, and towers. At the command of the aldermen, the hewers\r\nof stone for the cannon made thousands of balls.[1756]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1756: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nFrom My Lord, the Duke of Alencon, the magistrates received letters\r\nbeginning thus: \"To you, Provost of Paris and Provost of the Merchants\r\nand Aldermen....\" He named them by name and greeted them in eloquent\r\nlanguage. These letters were regarded as an artifice intended to\r\nrender the townsfolk suspicious of the aldermen and to incite one\r\nclass of the populace against the other. The only answer sent to the\r\nDuke was a request that he would not spoil any more paper with such\r\nmalicious endeavours.[1757]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1757: _Ibid._, pp. 243, 244.]\r\n\r\nThe chapter of Notre-Dame ordered masses to be said for the salvation\r\nof the people. On the 5th of September, three canons were authorised\r\nto make arrangements for the defence of the monastery. Those in charge\r\nof the sacristy took measures to hide the relics and the treasure of\r\nthe cathedral from the Armagnac soldiers. For two hundred golden\r\n_saluts_[1758] they sold the body of Saint Denys; but they kept the\r\nfoot, which was of silver, the head and the crown.[1759]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1758: Cf. _ante_, p. 45, note 2 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1759: Register of the Deliberations of the Chapter of Notre\r\nDame (Arch.

In it walked the canons of the Palace, bearing the True\r\nCross.[1760]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1760: Register of the Deliberations of the Chapter of Notre\r\nDame, in Tuetey, notes to _Le Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p.\r\n241, note 1.

It retreated in the evening; and on\r\nthat night the townsfolk slept in peace, for on the morrow Christians\r\ncelebrated the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin.[1761]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1761: Register of the Deliberations of the Chapter of Notre\r\nDame, _loc. cit._ _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 332. _Journal d'un\r\nbourgeois de Paris_, p. 244.

There was a certain holy man, who\r\npassed his life in meditation. On a day he called to mind that for\r\nmany years, on the 8th of September, he had heard marvellous angelic\r\nmusic in the air, and he prayed to God to reveal to him the reason for\r\nthis concert of instruments and of celestial voices. He was vouchsafed\r\nthe answer that it was the anniversary of the birth of the glorious\r\nVirgin Mary; and he received the command to instruct the faithful in\r\norder that they on that solemn day might join their voices to the\r\nangelic chorus. The matter was reported to the Sovereign Pontiff and\r\nthe other heads of the Church, who, after having prayed, fasted and\r\nconsulted the witnesses and traditions of the Church, decreed that\r\nhenceforth that day, the 8th of September, should be universally\r\nconsecrated to the celebration of the birth of the Virgin Mary.[1762]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1762: Voragine, _Legenda Aurea_. Anquetil, _La nativite,\r\nmiracle extrait de la legende doree_, in _Mem. Soc. Agr. de Bayeux_,\r\n1883, vol. x, p. 286. Douhet, _Dictionnaire des mysteres_, 1854, p.\r\n545.]\r\n\r\nThat day were read at mass the words of the prophet Isaiah: \"And there\r\nshall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall\r\ngrow out of his roots.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Paris thought that even the Armagnacs would do no work\r\non so high a festival and would keep the third commandment.\r\n\r\nOn this Thursday, the 8th of September, about eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the Maid, the Dukes of Alencon and of Bourbon, the Marshals\r\nof Boussac and of Rais, the Count of Vendome, the Lords of Laval, of\r\nAlbret and of Gaucourt, who with their men, to the number of ten\r\nthousand and more, had encamped in the village of La Chapelle,\r\nhalf-way along the road from Saint-Denys to Paris, set out on the\r\nmarch. At the hour of high mass, between eleven and twelve o'clock,\r\nthey reached the height of Les Moulins, at the foot of which the Swine\r\nMarket was held.[1763] Here there was a gibbet. Fifty-six years\r\nearlier, a woman of saintly life according to the people, but\r\naccording to the holy inquisitors, a heretic and _a Turlupine_, had\r\nbeen burned alive on that very market-place.[1764]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1763: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 166, 168. _Chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, pp. 333, 334.

It is impossible to\r\ntell. A few days earlier they had thrown a bridge across the River\r\nabove Paris,[1765] which looks as if they intended to attack the old\r\nfortification and get into the city from the University side. Did they\r\nmean to carry out the two attacks simultaneously? It is probable. Did\r\nthey renounce the project of their own accord or against their will?\r\nWe cannot tell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1765: Perceval de Cagny, p. 161.

They came to\r\nattempt in broad daylight the escalading and the storming of the\r\ngreatest, the most illustrious, and the most populous town of the\r\nrealm; an undertaking of vast importance, proposed doubtless and\r\ndecided in the royal council and with the knowledge of the King, who\r\ncan have been neither indifferent nor hostile to it.[1767] Charles of\r\nValois wanted to retake Paris. It remains to be seen whether for the\r\naccomplishment of his desire he depended merely on men-at-arms and\r\nladders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1766: Deliberation of the Chapter of Notre Dame, _loc. cit._\r\n_Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 245.

But she was as sure of entering the town that day as\r\nof going to Paradise when she died. For more than three years her\r\nVoices had been drumming the attack on Paris in her ears.[1769] But the\r\nastonishing point is that, saint as she was, she should have consented\r\nto arm and fight on the day of the Nativity. It was contrary to her\r\naction on the 5th of May, Ascension Day, and inconsistent with what\r\nshe had said on the 8th of the same month: \"As ye love and honour the\r\nSacred Sabbath do not begin the battle.\"[1770]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1768: _Ibid._, pp. 57, 146, 168, 250.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1769: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 130 (letter of the 17th of July,\r\n1429), vol. i, p. 298. \"Et hoc sciebar per revelationem.\" Cf. vol. i,\r\npp. 57, 260, 288 in contradiction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1770: _Journal du siege_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nTrue it is that afterwards, at Montepilloy, she had engaged in a\r\nskirmish on the Day of the Assumption, and thus scandalized the\r\nmasters of the University. She acted according to the counsel of her\r\nVoices and her decisions depended on the vaguest murmurings in her\r\near. Nothing is more inconstant and more contradictory than the\r\ninspirations of such visionaries, who are but the playthings of their\r\ndreams. What is certain at least is that Jeanne now as always was\r\nconvinced that she was doing right and committing no sin.[1771] Arrayed\r\non the height of Les Moulins, in front of Paris with its grey\r\nfortifications, the French had immediately before them the outermost\r\nof the trenches, dry and narrow, some sixteen or seventeen feet deep,\r\nseparated by a mound from the second trench, nearly one hundred feet\r\nbroad, deep and filled with water which lapped the walls of the city.\r\nQuite close, on their right, the road to Roule led up to the Saint\r\nHonore Gate, also called the Gate of the Blind because it was near the\r\nHospital of Les Quinze Vingts.[1772] It opened beneath a castlet\r\nflanked by turrets, and for an advanced defence it had a bulwark\r\nsurrounded by wooden barriers, like those of Orleans.[1773]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1771: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 147, 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1772: In 1254 Saint Louis founded this hospital for three\r\nhundred blind knights whose eyes had been put out by the Saracens.\r\n(W.S.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1773: Le Roux de Lincy and Tisserand, _Paris et ses\r\nhistoriens_, pp. 205 and 231, note 4.

Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, p. 108.]\r\n\r\nThe French arrayed themselves slightly behind the Moulin hill, which\r\nwas to protect them from the stream of lead and stones beginning to be\r\ndischarged from the artillery on the ramparts. There they ranged their\r\nmortars, their culverins and their cannon, ready to fire on the city\r\nwalls. In this position, which commanded the widest stretch of the\r\nfortifications, was the main body of the army. Led by Messire de\r\nSaint-Vallier a knight of Dauphine, several captains and men-at-arms\r\napproached the Saint Honore Gate and set fire to the barriers. As the\r\ngarrison of the gate had withdrawn within the fortification, and as\r\nthe enemy was not seen to be coming out by any other exit, the\r\nMarechal de Rais' company advanced with fagots, bundles and ladders\r\nright up to the ramparts. The Maid rode at the head of her company.\r\nThey halted between the Saint-Denys and the Saint-Honore Gates, but\r\nnearer the latter, and went down into the first trench, which was not\r\ndifficult to cross. But on the mound they found themselves exposed to\r\nbolts and arrows which rained straight down from the walls.[1776] As at\r\nOrleans, and at Les Tourelles, Jeanne had given her banner to a man of\r\nvalour to hold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1776: Perceval de Cagny, p. 167.]\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the top of the mound, she cried out to the folk in\r\nParis: \"Surrender the town to the King of France.\"[1777]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1777: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 148.]\r\n\r\nThe Burgundians heard her saying also: \"In Jesus' name surrender to us\r\nspeedily. For if ye yield not before nightfall, we shall enter by\r\nforce, whether ye will or no, and ye shall all be put to death without\r\nmercy.\"[1778]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1778: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 245.]\r\n\r\nOn the mound she remained, sounding the great dyke with her lance and\r\nmarvelling to find it so full and so deep. And yet for eleven days she\r\nand her men-at-arms had been reconnoitring round the walls and seeking\r\nthe most favourable point of attack. That she should not have known\r\nhow to plan an attack was quite natural. But what is to be thought of\r\nthe men-at-arms, who were there on the mound, taken by surprise, as\r\nbaffled as she, and all aghast at finding so much water close to the\r\nSeine when the River was in flood? To be able to reconnoitre the\r\ndefences of a fortress was surely the _a b c_ of the trade of war.\r\nCaptains and soldiers of fortune never risked advancing against a\r\nfortification without knowing first whether there were water, morass\r\nor briars, and arming themselves accordingly with siege train suitable\r\nto the occasion. When the water of the moat was deep they launched\r\nleather boats carried on horses' backs.[1779] The men-at-arms of the\r\nMarechal de Rais and my Lord of Alencon were more ignorant than the\r\nmeanest adventurers. What would the doughty La Hire have thought of\r\nthem? Such gross ineptitude and ignorance appeared so incredible that\r\nit was supposed that those fighting men knew the depth of the moat but\r\nconcealed it from the Maid, desiring her discomfiture.[1780] In such a\r\ncase, while entrapping the damsel they were themselves entrapped, for\r\nthere they stayed moving neither backwards nor forwards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1779: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1780: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 333.

Coustelier, 1724, vol. i, p. 113.]\r\n\r\nCertain among them idly threw fagots into the moat. Meanwhile the\r\ndefenders assailed by flights of arrows, disappeared one after the\r\nother.[1781] But towards four o'clock in the afternoon, the citizens\r\narrived in crowds. The cannon of the Saint-Denys Gate thundered.\r\nArrows and abuse flew between those above and those below. The hours\r\npassed, the sun was sinking. The Maid never ceased sounding the moat\r\nwith the staff of her lance and crying out to the Parisians to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1781: Perceval de Cagny, p. 167.

There, minx!\" cried a Burgundian.\r\n\r\nAnd planting his cross-bow in the ground with his foot, he shot an\r\narrow which split one of her greaves and wounded her in the thigh.\r\nAnother Burgundian took aim at the Maid's standard-bearer and wounded\r\nhim in the foot. The wounded man raised his visor to see whence the\r\narrow came and straightway received another between the eyes. The Maid\r\nand the Duke of Alencon sorely regretted the loss of this\r\nman-at-arms.[1782]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1782: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 57, 246. _Journal d'un bourgeois\r\nde Paris_, p. 245.

Perceval de Cagny,\r\nJean Chartier, _Journal du siege_, Monstrelet, Morosini, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nAfter she had been wounded, Jeanne cried all the more loudly that the\r\nwalls must be reached and the city taken. She was placed out of reach\r\nof the arrows in the shelter of a breast-work. There she urged the\r\nmen-at-arms to throw fagots into the water and make a bridge. About\r\nten or eleven o'clock in the evening, the Sire de la Tremouille\r\ncharged the combatants to retreat. The Maid would not leave the place.\r\nShe was doubtless listening to her Saints and beholding celestial\r\nhosts around her. The Duke of Alencon sent for her. The aged Sire de\r\nGaucourt[1783] carried her off with the aid of a captain of Picardy,\r\none Guichard Bournel, who did not please her on that day, and who by\r\nhis treachery six months later, was to please her still less.[1784] Had\r\nshe not been wounded she would have resisted more strongly.[1785] She\r\nyielded regretfully, saying: \"In God's name! the city might have been\r\ntaken.\"[1786]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1783: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1784: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 111, 273.

Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 109. Monstrelet, vol.\r\niv, pp. 355, 356.]\r\n\r\nThe French returned to La Chapelle, whence they had set out in the\r\nmorning. They carried their wounded on some of the carts which they\r\nhad used for the transport of fagots and ladders. In the hands of the\r\nenemy they left three hundred hand-carts, six hundred and sixty\r\nladders, four thousand hurdles and large fagots, of which they had\r\nused but a small number.[1788] Their retreat must have been somewhat\r\nhurried, seeing that, when they came to the Barn of Les Mathurins,\r\nnear The Swine Market, they forsook their baggage and set fire to it.\r\nWith horror it was related that, like pagans of Rome, they had cast\r\ntheir dead into the flames.[1789] Nevertheless the Parisians dared not\r\npursue them. In those days men-at-arms who knew their trade never\r\nretreated without laying some snare for the enemy. Consequently the\r\nKing's men posted a considerable company in ambush by the roadside, to\r\nlie in wait for the light troops who should come in pursuit of the\r\nretreating army.[1790] It was precisely such an ambuscade that the\r\nParisians feared; wherefore they permitted the Armagnacs to regain\r\ntheir camp at La Chapelle-Saint-Denys unmolested.[1791]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1788: Deliberation of the Chapter of Notre Dame, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1789: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1790: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1791: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 245, 246.]\r\n\r\nIf we regard only the military tactics of the day, there is no doubt\r\nthat the French had blundered and had lacked energy. But it was not on\r\nmilitary tactics that the greatest reliance had been placed. Those who\r\nconducted the war, the King and his council, certainly expected to\r\nenter Paris that day. But how? As they had entered Chalons, as they\r\nhad entered Reims, as they had entered all the King's good towns from\r\nTroyes to Compiegne. King Charles had shown himself determined to\r\nrecover his towns by means of the townsfolk; towards Paris he acted as\r\nhe had acted towards his other towns.\r\n\r\nDuring the coronation march, he had entered into communication with\r\nthe bishops and burgesses of the cities of Champagne; and like\r\ncommunications he had entered into in Paris.[1792] He had dealings with\r\nthe monks and notably with the Carmelites of Melun, whose Prior,\r\nBrother Pierre d'Allee, was working in his interest.[1793] For some\r\ntime paid agents had been watching for an opportunity of throwing the\r\ncity into disorder and of bringing in the enemy in a moment of panic\r\nand confusion. During the assault they were working for him in the\r\nstreets. In the afternoon, on both sides of the bridges, were heard\r\ncries of \"Let every man look to his own safety! The enemy has entered!\r\nAll is lost!\" Such of the citizens as were listening to the sermon\r\nhastened to shut themselves in their houses. And others who were out\r\nof doors sought refuge in the churches. But the tumult was quelled.\r\nWise men, like the clerk of the Parlement, believed that it was but a\r\nfeigned attack, and that Charles of Valois looked to recover the town\r\nnot so much by force of arms as by a movement of the populace.[1794]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1792: For the opinions of the townsfolk of Paris, see various\r\nacts of Henry VI of the 18th and 25th of Sept., 1429 (MS. Fontanieu,\r\n115). Sauval, _Antiquites de Paris_, vol. iii, p. 586 and _circ._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1793: A. Longnon, _Paris pendant la domination anglaise_, p.\r\n302.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1794: Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 456, 458.]\r\n\r\nCertain monks who were acting in Paris as the King's spies, went out\r\nto him at Saint-Denys and informed him that the attempt had failed.\r\nAccording to them it had very nearly succeeded.[1795]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1795: _Relation du greffier de La Rochelle_, p. 344.]\r\n\r\nThe Sire de la Tremouille is said to have commanded the retreat, for\r\nfear of a massacre. Indeed, once the French had entered they were\r\nquite capable of slaughtering the townsfolk and razing the city to the\r\nground.[1796]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1796: _Chronique de Normandie_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 342,\r\n343.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Friday the 9th, the Maid, rising with the dawn, despite\r\nher wound, asked the Duke of Alencon to have the call to arms sounded;\r\nfor she was strongly determined to return to the walls of Paris,\r\nswearing not to leave them until the city should be taken.[1797]\r\nMeanwhile the French captains sent a herald to Paris, charged to ask\r\nfor a safe conduct for the removing of the bodies of the dead left\r\nbehind in great numbers.[1798]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1797: Perceval de Cagny, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1798: _Ibid._ _Chronique normande_, in _La chronique de la\r\nPucelle_, p. 465. Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, p. 120, note 1.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that they had suffered cruel hurt, after a retreat\r\nunmolested it is true, but none the less disastrous and involving the\r\nloss of all their siege train, several of the leaders were, like the\r\nMaid, inclined to attempt a new assault. Others would not hear of it.\r\nWhile they were disputing, they beheld a baron coming towards them and\r\nwith him fifty nobles; it was the Sire de Montmorency, the first\r\nChristian peer of France, that is the first among the ancient vassals\r\nof the bishop of Paris. He was transferring his allegiance from the\r\nCross of St. Andrew to the Flowers-de-luce.[1799] His coming filled the\r\nKing's men with courage and a desire to return to the city. The army\r\nwas on its way back, when the Count of Clermont and the Duke of Bar\r\nwere sent to arrest the march by order of the King, and to take the\r\nMaid back to Saint-Denys.[1800]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1799: Duchesne, _Histoire de la maison de Montmorency_, p.\r\n232.

Lefevre-Pontalis, _Un detail du siege de Paris_, in\r\n_Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, vol. xlvi, 1885, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 10th, at daybreak, the Duke of Alencon, with a few\r\nknights, appeared on the bank above the city, where a bridge had been\r\nthrown over the Seine some days earlier. The Maid, always eager for\r\ndanger, accompanied the venturesome warriors. But the night before,\r\nthe King had prudently caused the bridge to be taken down, and the\r\nlittle band had to retrace its steps.[1801] It was not that the King\r\nhad renounced the idea of taking Paris. He was thinking more than ever\r\nof the recovery of his great town; but he intended to regain it\r\nwithout an assault, by means of the compliance of certain burgesses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1801: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 168, 169. Morosini, vol. iii, p.\r\n219, note 4. Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii,\r\np. 120, note 1. G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _Un detail du siege de Paris_,\r\n_loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nAt this same place of Saint-Denys there happened to Jeanne a\r\nmisadventure, which would seem to have impressed her comrades and\r\npossibly to have lessened their faith in her good luck in war. As was\r\ncustomary, women of ill-fame followed the army in great numbers; each\r\nman had his own; they were called _amietes_.[1802] Jeanne could not\r\ntolerate them because they caused disorder, but more especially\r\nbecause their sinful lives filled her with horror. At that very time,\r\nstories like the following were circulated far and wide, and spread\r\neven into Germany.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1802: Diminutive of _amie_ (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nThere was a certain man in the camp, who had with him his _amiete_.\r\nShe rode in armour in order not to be recognised. Now the Maid said to\r\nthe nobles and captains: \"There is a woman with our men.\" They replied\r\nthat they knew of none. Whereupon the Maid assembled the army, and,\r\napproaching the woman said: \"This is she.\"\r\n\r\nThen addressing the wench: \"Thou art of Gien and thou art big with\r\nchild. Were it not so I would put thee to death. Thou hast already let\r\none child die and thou shalt not do the same for this one.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Maid had thus spoken, servants took the wench and conveyed\r\nher to her own home. There they kept her under watch and ward until\r\nshe was delivered of her child. And she confessed that what the Maid\r\nhad said was true.\r\n\r\nAfter which, the Maid again said: \"There are women in the camp.\"\r\nWhereupon two wantons, who did not belong to the army, and had already\r\nbeen dismissed from it, hearing these words, rode off on horseback.\r\nBut the Maid hastened after them crying: \"Ye foolish women, I have\r\nforbidden you to come into my company.\" And she drew her sword and\r\nstruck one of them on the head, so sore that she died.[1803]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1803: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 184, 186.]\r\n\r\nThe tale was true; Jeanne could not suffer these wenches. Every time\r\nshe met one she gave chase to her. This was precisely what she did at\r\nGien, when she saw women of ill-fame awaiting the King's men.[1804] At\r\nChateau-Thierry, she espied an _amiete_ riding behind a man-at-arms,\r\nand, running after her, sword in hand, she came up with her, and\r\nwithout striking, bade her henceforth avoid the society of\r\nmen-at-arms. \"If thou wilt not,\" she added, \"I shall do thee\r\nhurt.\"[1805]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1804: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1805: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 73.]\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Denys, being accompanied by the Duke of Alencon, Jeanne\r\npursued another of these wantons. This time she was not content with\r\nremonstrances and threats. She broke her sword over her.[1806] Was it\r\nSaint Catherine's sword? So it was believed, and doubtless not without\r\nreason.[1807] In those days men's minds were full of the romantic\r\nstories of Joyeuse and Durandal. It would appear that Jeanne, when she\r\nlost her sword, lost her power. A slight variation of the story was\r\ntold afterwards, and it was related how the King, when he was\r\nacquainted with the matter of the broken sword, was displeased and\r\nsaid to the Maid: \"You should have taken a stick to strike withal and\r\nshould not have risked the sword you received from divine hands.\"[1808]\r\nIt was told likewise how the sword had been given to an armourer for\r\nhim to join the pieces together, and that he could not, wherein lay a\r\nproof that the sword was enchanted.[1809]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1806: _Ibid._, p. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1807: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1808: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1809: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 122, 123.]\r\n\r\nBefore his departure, the King appointed the Count of Clermont\r\ncommander of the district with several lieutenants: the Lords of\r\nCulant, Boussac, Lore, and Foucault. He constituted joint\r\nlieutenants-general the Counts of Clermont and of Vendome, the lords\r\nRegnault de Chartres, Christophe d'Harcourt and Jean Tudert. Regnault\r\nde Chartres established himself in the town of Senlis, the\r\nlieutenant's headquarters. Having thus disposed, the King quitted\r\nSaint-Denys on the 13th of September.[1810] The Maid followed him\r\nagainst her will notwithstanding that she had the permission of her\r\nVoices to do so.[1811] She offered her armour to the image of Our Lady\r\nand to the precious body of Saint Denys.[1812] This armour was white,\r\nthat is to say devoid of armorial bearings.[1813] She was thus\r\nfollowing the custom of men-at-arms, who, after they had received a\r\nwound, if they did not die of it, offered their armour to Our Lady and\r\nthe Saints as a token of thanksgiving. Wherefore, in those warlike\r\ndays, chapels, like that of Notre-Dame de Fierbois, often presented\r\nthe appearance of arsenals. To her armour the Maid added a sword which\r\nshe had won before Paris.[1814]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1810: Perceval de Cagny, p. 169. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\npp. 335 _et seq._ Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 112 _et\r\nseq._ Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 356. _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_,\r\np. 246.

On the 21st of\r\nSeptember he reached Gien. There he disbanded the army he could no\r\nlonger pay, and each man went to his own home. The Duke of Alencon\r\nwithdrew into his viscounty of Beaumont-sur-Oise.[1815]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1815: _Journal du siege_, p. 130.

Regnier\r\nwas then Receiver General. He had been one of those whose dismissal\r\nthe University had requested in 1408, as being worse than useless,\r\nfor they held him responsible for many of the disorders in the\r\nkingdom. He had entered the Dauphin's service, passed from the\r\nadministration of the royal domain to that of taxes and attained the\r\nhighest rank in the control of the finances.[1817] His wife, who had\r\naccompanied the Queen to Selles, beheld the Maid and wondered. Jeanne\r\nseemed to her a creature sent by God for the relief of the King and\r\nthose of France who were loyal to him. She remembered the days not so\r\nvery long ago when she had seen the Dauphin and her Husband not\r\nknowing where to turn for money. Her name was Marguerite La Touroulde;\r\nshe was damiselle, not dame; a comfortable _bourgeoise_ and that was\r\nall.[1818]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1816: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 86.

She\r\nslept there, drank there, ate there. Nearly every night, Damiselle\r\nMarguerite La Touroulde slept with her; the etiquette of those days\r\nrequired it. No night-gowns were worn; folk slept naked in those vast\r\nbeds. It would seem that Jeanne disliked sleeping with old women.[1819]\r\nDamiselle La Touroulde, although not so very old, was of matronly\r\nage;[1820] she had moreover a matron's experience, and further she\r\nclaimed, as we shall see directly, to know more than most matrons\r\nknew. Several times she took Jeanne to the bath and to the\r\nsweating-room.[1821] That also was one of the rules of etiquette; a\r\nhost was not considered to be making his guests good cheer unless he\r\ntook them to the bath. In this point of courtesy princes set an\r\nexample; when the King and Queen supped in the house of one of their\r\nretainers or ministers, fine baths richly ornamented were prepared for\r\nthem before they came to table.[1822] Mistress Marguerite doubtless did\r\nnot possess what was necessary in her own house; wherefore she took\r\nJeanne out to the bath and the sweating-room. Such are her own\r\nexpressions; and they probably indicate a vapour bath[1823] not a bath\r\nof hot water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1819: _Ibid._, pp. 81, 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1820: Lanery d'Arc and L.

Jeny, _Jeanne d'Arc en Berry_, pp.\r\n76, 77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1825: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1826: _Ibid._, p. 88.]\r\n\r\nIn Messire Regnier de Bouligny's house and likewise wherever she\r\nlodged, she led the life of a _beguine_ but did not practise\r\nexcessive austerity. She confessed frequently. Many a time she asked\r\nher hostess to come with her to matins. In the cathedral and in\r\ncollegiate churches there were matins every day, between four and six,\r\nat the hour of sunset. The two women often talked together; the\r\nReceiver General's wife found Jeanne very simple and very ignorant.\r\nShe was amazed to discover that the maiden knew absolutely\r\nnothing.[1827]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1827: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 87. Lanery d'Arc and L. Jeny,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc en Berry_, pp. 73, 74.]\r\n\r\nAmong other matters, Jeanne told of her visit to the old Duke of\r\nLorraine, and how she had rebuked him for his evil life; she spoke\r\nlikewise of the interrogatory to which the doctors of Poitiers had\r\nsubjected her.[1828] She was persuaded that these clerks had questioned\r\nher with extreme severity, and she firmly believed that she had\r\ntriumphed over their ill-will. Alas! she was soon to know clerks even\r\nless accommodating.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1828: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 86, 87.]\r\n\r\nMistress Marguerite said to her one day: \"If you are not afraid when\r\nyou fight, it is because you know you will not be killed.\" Whereupon\r\nJeanne answered: \"I am no surer of that than are the other\r\ncombatants.\"\r\n\r\nOftentimes women came to the Bouligny house, bringing paternosters and\r\nother trifling objects of devotion for the Maid to touch.\r\n\r\nJeanne used to say laughingly to her hostess: \"Touch them yourself.\r\nYour touch will do them as much good as mine.\"[1829]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1829: _Ibid._, pp. 86, 88.]\r\n\r\nThis ready repartee must have shown Mistress Marguerite that Jeanne,\r\nignorant as she may have been, was none the less capable of\r\ndisplaying a good grace and common sense in her conversation.\r\n\r\nWhile in many matters this good woman found the Maid but a simple\r\ncreature, in military affairs she deemed her an expert. Whether, when\r\nshe judged the saintly damsel's skill in wielding arms, she was giving\r\nher own opinion or merely speaking from hearsay, as would seem\r\nprobable, she at any rate declared later that Jeanne rode a horse and\r\nhandled a lance as well as the best of knights and so well that the\r\narmy marvelled.[1830] Indeed most captains in those days could do no\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1830: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 88.]\r\n\r\nProbably there were dice and dice-boxes in the Bouligny house,\r\notherwise Jeanne would have had no opportunity of displaying that\r\nhorror of gaming which struck her hostess. On this matter Jeanne\r\nagreed with her comrade, Friar Richard, and indeed with everyone else\r\nof good life and good doctrine.[1831]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1831: _Ibid._, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nWhat money she had Jeanne distributed in alms. \"I am come to succour\r\nthe poor and needy,\" she used to say.[1832]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1832: _Ibid._, pp. 87, 88.]\r\n\r\nWhen the multitude heard such words they were led to believe that this\r\nMaid of God had been raised up for something more than the\r\nglorification of the Lilies, and that she was come to dispel such ills\r\nas murder, pillage and other sins grievous to God, from which the\r\nrealm was suffering. Mystic souls looked to her for the reform of the\r\nChurch and the reign of Jesus Christ on earth. She was invoked as a\r\nsaint, and throughout the loyal provinces were to be seen carved and\r\npainted images of her which were worshipped by the faithful. Thus,\r\neven during her lifetime, she enjoyed certain of the privileges of\r\nbeatification.[1833]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1833: Noel Valois, _Un nouveau temoignage sur Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nin _Annuaire bulletin de la Societe de l'Histoire de France_, Paris,\r\n1907, in 8vo, pp. 8 and 18 (separate issue).]\r\n\r\nNorth of the Seine meanwhile, English and Burgundians were at their\r\nold work. The Duke of Vendome and his company fell back on Senlis, the\r\nEnglish descended on the town of Saint-Denys and sacked it once more.\r\nIn the Abbey Church they found and carried off the Maid's armour,\r\nthus, according to the French clergy, committing undeniable sacrilege\r\nand for this reason: because they gave the monks of the Abbey nothing\r\nin exchange.\r\n\r\nThe King was then at Mehun-sur-Yevre, quite close to Bourges, in one\r\nof the finest chateaux in the world, rising on a rock and overlooking\r\nthe town. The late Duke Jean of Berry, a great builder, had erected\r\nthis chateau with the care that he never failed to exercise in matters\r\nof art. Mehun was King Charles's favourite abode.[1834]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1834: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 217. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de\r\nCharles VII_, vol. ii, p. 265. A.

He sent to the King to know if it were his good pleasure to\r\ngrant him the Maid. \"Many there be,\" said the Duke, \"who would\r\nwillingly come with her, while without her they will not stir from\r\ntheir homes.\" Her discomfiture before Paris had not, therefore,\r\nentirely ruined her prestige. The Sire de la Tremouille opposed her\r\nbeing sent to the Duke of Alencon, whom he mistrusted, and not without\r\ncause. He gave her into the care of his half-brother, the Sire\r\nd'Albret, Lieutenant of the King in his own country of Berry.[1835]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1835: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 170, 171.

The army for this expedition assembled at\r\nBourges. It was commanded by my Lord d'Albret,[1838] but popular report\r\nattributed the command to Jeanne. The common folk, the burgesses of\r\nthe towns, especially the citizens of Orleans knew no other commander.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1836: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 310. _Journal du siege_,\r\np. 107.

Lanery d'Arc and L. Jeny,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc en Berry_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nAfter two or three days' siege, the King's men stormed the town. But\r\nthey were repulsed. Squire Jean d'Aulon, the Maid's steward, who some\r\ntime before had been wounded in the heel and consequently walked on\r\ncrutches, had retreated with the rest.[1839] He went back and found\r\nJeanne who had stayed almost alone by the side of the moat. Fearing\r\nlest harm should come to her, he leapt on to his horse, spurred\r\ntowards her and cried: \"What are you doing, all alone? Wherefore do\r\nyou not retreat like the others?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1839: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 217.]\r\n\r\nJeanne doffed her sallet and replied: \"I am not alone. With me are\r\nfifty thousand of my folk. I will not quit this spot till I have taken\r\nthe town.\"\r\n\r\nCasting his eyes around, Messire Jean d'Aulon saw the Maid surrounded\r\nby but four or five men.\r\n\r\nMore loudly he cried out to her: \"Depart hence and retreat like the\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nHer only reply was a request for fagots and hurdles to fill up the\r\nmoat. And straightway in a loud voice she called: \"To the fagots and\r\nthe hurdles all of ye, and make a bridge!\"\r\n\r\nThe men-at-arms rushed to the spot, the bridge was constructed\r\nforthwith and the town taken by storm with no great difficulty. At any\r\nrate that is how the good Squire, Jean d'Aulon, told the story.[1840]\r\nHe was almost persuaded that the Maid's fifty thousand shadows had\r\ntaken Saint-Pierre-le-Moustier.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1840: _Ibid._, p. 218.]\r\n\r\nWith the little army on the Loire at that time were certain holy women\r\nwho like Jeanne led a singular life and held communion with the Church\r\nTriumphant. They constituted, so to speak, a kind of flying squadron\r\nof _beguines_, which followed the men-at-arms. One of these women was\r\ncalled Catherine de La Rochelle; two others came from Lower\r\nBrittany.[1841]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1841: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 106. _Journal d'un bourgeois de\r\nParis_, pp. 259, 260, 271, 272.

But he had been entirely supplanted by the Franciscan, Friar\r\nRichard, who, after Troyes, had joined the mendicants of Jeanne's\r\nearlier days. Friar Richard dominated this little band of the\r\nilluminated. He was called their good Father. He it was who instructed\r\nthem.[1846] His designs for these women did not greatly differ from\r\nthose of Jean Pasquerel: he intended to conduct them to those wars of\r\nthe Cross, which he thought were bound to precede the impending end of\r\nthe world.[1847]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1845: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 104 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1846: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 450. _Journal d'un bourgeois de\r\nParis_, pp. 271, 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1847: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 235.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was his endeavour to foster a good understanding\r\nbetween them, which, eloquent preacher though he was, he found very\r\ndifficult. Within the sisterhood there were constant suspicions and\r\ndisputes. Jeanne had been on friendly terms with Catherine de la\r\nRochelle at Montfaucon in Brie and at Jargeau; but now she began to\r\nsuspect her of being a rival, and immediately she assumed an attitude\r\nof mistrust.[1848] Possibly she was right. At any moment either\r\nCatherine or the Breton women might be made use of as she had\r\nbeen.[1849] In those days a prophetess was useful in so many ways: in\r\nthe edification of the people, the reformation of the Church, the\r\nleading of men-at-arms, the circulation of money, in war, in peace; no\r\nsooner did one appear than each party tried to get hold of her. It\r\nseems as if, after having employed the Maid Jeanne to deliver Orleans,\r\nthe King's Councillors were now thinking of employing Dame Catherine\r\nto make peace with the Duke of Burgundy. Such a task was deemed\r\nfitting for a saint less chivalrous than Jeanne. Catherine was married\r\nand the mother of a family. In this circumstance there need be no\r\ncause for astonishment; for if the gift of prophecy be more especially\r\nreserved for virgins, the example of Judith proves that the Lord may\r\nraise up strong matrons for the serving of his people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1848: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1849: _Ibid._, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nIf we believe that, as her surname indicates, she came from La\r\nRochelle, her origin must have inspired the Armagnacs with confidence.\r\nThe inhabitants of La Rochelle, all pirates more or less, were too\r\nprofitably engaged in preying upon English vessels to forsake the\r\nDauphin's party. Moreover, he rewarded their loyalty by granting them\r\nvaluable commercial privileges.[1850] They had sent gifts of money to\r\nthe people of Orleans; and when, in the month of May, they learned the\r\ndeliverance of Duke Charles's city, they instituted a public festival\r\nto commemorate so happy an event.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1850: Arcere, _Histoire de La Rochelle_, 1756, in 4to, vol.\r\ni, p. 271. _Trial_, vol. v, p. 104, note. Vallet de Viriville,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, pp. 24, 75 _et seq._, 219, 279.]\r\n\r\nThe first duty of a saint in the army, it would appear, was to collect\r\nmoney. Jeanne was always sending letters asking the good towns for\r\nmoney or for munitions of war; the burgesses always promised to grant\r\nher request and sometimes they kept their promise. Catherine de la\r\nRochelle appears to have had special revelations concerning the funds\r\nof the party; her mission, therefore, was financial, while Jeanne's\r\nwas martial. She announced that she was going to the Duke of Burgundy\r\nto conclude peace.[1851] If one may judge from the little that is known\r\nof her, the inspirations of this holy dame were not very elevated, not\r\nvery orderly, not very profound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1851: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 107, 108.]\r\n\r\nMeeting Jeanne at Montfaucon in Berry (or at Jargeau) she addressed\r\nher thus:\r\n\r\n\"There came unto me a white lady, attired in cloth of gold, who said\r\nto me: 'Go thou through the good towns and let the King give unto thee\r\nheralds and trumpets to cry: \"Whosoever has gold, silver or hidden\r\ntreasure, let him bring it forth instantly.\"'\"\r\n\r\nDame Catherine added: \"Such as have hidden treasure and do not thus, I\r\nshall know their treasure, and I shall go and find it.\"\r\n\r\nShe deemed it necessary to fight against the English and seemed to\r\nbelieve that Jeanne's mission was to drive them out of the land, since\r\nshe obligingly offered her the whole of her miraculous takings.\r\n\r\n\"Wherewithal to pay your men-at-arms,\" she said. But the Maid answered\r\ndisdainfully:\r\n\r\n\"Go back to your husband, look after your household, and feed your\r\nchildren.\"[1852]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1852: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nDisputes between saints are usually bitter. In her rival's missions\r\nJeanne refused to see anything but folly and futility. Nevertheless it\r\nwas not for her to deny the possibility of the white lady's\r\nvisitations; for to Jeanne herself did there not descend every day as\r\nmany saints, angels and archangels as were ever painted on the pages\r\nof books or the walls of monasteries? In order to make up her mind on\r\nthe subject, she adopted the most effectual measures. A learned doctor\r\nmay reason concerning matter and substance, the origin and the form of\r\nideas, the dawn of impressions in the intellect, but a shepherdess\r\nwill resort to a surer method; she will appeal to her own eyesight.\r\n\r\nJeanne asked Catherine if the white lady came every night, and\r\nlearning that she did: \"I will sleep with you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, she went to bed with Catherine, watched till\r\nmidnight, saw nothing and fell asleep, for she was young, and she had\r\ngreat need of sleep. In the morning, when she awoke, she asked: \"Did\r\nshe come?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did,\" replied Catherine; \"you were asleep, so I did not like to\r\nwake you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will she not come to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nCatherine assured her that she would come without fail.\r\n\r\nThis time Jeanne slept in the day in order that she might keep awake\r\nat night; so she lay down at night in the bed with Catherine and kept\r\nher eyes open. Often she asked: \"Will she not come?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine replied: \"Yes, directly.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jeanne saw nothing.[1853] She held the test to be a good one.\r\nNevertheless she could not get the white lady attired in cloth of gold\r\nout of her head. When Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret came to her,\r\nas they delayed not to do, she spoke to them concerning this white\r\nlady and asked them what she was to think of her. The reply was such\r\nas Jeanne expected:\r\n\r\n\"This Catherine,\" they said, \"is naught but futility and folly.\"[1854]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1853: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 108, 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1854: _Ibid._, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nThen was Jeanne constrained to cry: \"That is just what I thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe strife between these two prophetesses was brief but bitter. Jeanne\r\nalways maintained the opposite of what Catherine said. When the latter\r\nwas going to make peace with the Duke of Burgundy, Jeanne said to her:\r\n\r\n\"Me seemeth that you will never find peace save at the lance's\r\npoint.\"[1855]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1855: _Ibid._, p. 108.]\r\n\r\nThere was one matter at any rate wherein the White Lady proved a\r\nbetter prophetess than the Maid's Council, to wit, the siege of La\r\nCharite. When Jeanne wished to go and deliver that town, Catherine\r\ntried to dissuade her.\r\n\r\n\"It is too cold,\" she said; \"I would not go.\"[1856]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1856: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nCatherine's reason was not a high one; and yet it is true Jeanne would\r\nhave done better not to go to the siege of La Charite.\r\n\r\nTaken from the Duke of Burgundy by the Dauphin in 1422, La Charite had\r\nbeen retaken in 1424, by Perrinet Gressart,[1857] a successful\r\ncaptain, who had risen from the rank of mason's apprentice to that of\r\npantler to the Duke of Burgundy and had been created Lord of Laigny by\r\nthe King of England.[1858] On the 30th of December, 1425, Perrinet's\r\nmen arrested the Sire de La Tremouille, when he was on his way to the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, having been appointed ambassador in one of those\r\neternal negotiations, forever in process between the King and the\r\nDuke. He was for several months kept a prisoner in the fortress which\r\nhis captor commanded. He must needs pay a ransom of fourteen thousand\r\ngolden crowns; and, albeit he took this sum from the royal\r\ntreasury,[1859] he never ceased to bear Perrinet a grudge. Wherefore it\r\nmay be concluded that when he sent men-at-arms to La Charite it was in\r\ngood sooth to capture the town and not with any evil design against\r\nthe Maid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1857: \"Perrinet Crasset, mason and captain of men-at-arms.\"\r\n_Chronique des cordeliers_, fol. 446 verso.

Its leaders were\r\nLouis of Bourbon, Count of Montpensier, and Charles II, Sire d'Albret,\r\nLa Tremouille's half-brother and Jeanne's companion in arms during the\r\ncoronation campaign. The army was doubtless but scantily supplied\r\nwith stores and with money.[1860] That was the normal condition of\r\narmies in those days. When the King wanted to attack a stronghold of\r\nthe enemy, he must needs apply to his good towns for the necessary\r\nmaterial. The Maid, at once saint and warrior, could beg for arms with\r\na good grace; but possibly she overrated the resources of the towns\r\nwhich had already given so much.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1860: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 149.

Churchmen, magistrates, and townsfolk sent two\r\nhundredweight of saltpetre, one hundredweight of sulphur, two cases of\r\narrows; to these they added a sword, two poniards and a battle-axe for\r\nthe Maid; and they charged Messire Robert Andrieu to present this\r\ncontribution to Jeanne and to my Lord d'Albret.[1861]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1861: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 146. F. Perot, _Un document inedit\r\nsur Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Bulletin de la Societe archeologique de\r\nl'Orleanais_, vol. xii, 1898-1901, p. 231.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November, the Maid was at Moulins in Bourbonnais.[1862]\r\nWhat was she doing there? No one knows. There was at that time in the\r\ntown an abbess very holy and very greatly venerated. Her name was\r\nColette Boilet. She had won the highest praise and incurred the\r\ngrossest insults by attempting to reform the order of Saint Clare.\r\nColette lived in the convent of the Sisters of Saint Clare, which she\r\nhad recently founded in this town. It has been thought that the Maid\r\nwent to Moulins on purpose to meet her.[1863] But we ought first to\r\nascertain whether these two saints had any liking for each other. They\r\nboth worked miracles and miracles which were occasionally somewhat\r\nsimilar;[1864] but that was no reason why they should take the\r\nslightest pleasure in each other's society. One was called _La\r\nPucelle_,[1865] the other _La Petite Ancelle_.[1866] But these names,\r\nboth equally humble, described persons widely different in fashion of\r\nattire and in manner of life. _La Petite Ancelle_ wended her way on\r\nfoot, clothed in rags like a beggar-woman; _La Pucelle_, wrapped in\r\ncloth of gold, rode forth with lords on horseback. That Jeanne,\r\nsurrounded by Franciscans who observed no rule, felt any veneration\r\nfor the reformer of the Sisters of Saint Clare, there is no reason to\r\nbelieve; neither is there anything to indicate that the pacific\r\nColette, strongly attached to the Burgundian house,[1867] had any\r\ndesire to hold converse with one whom the English regarded as a\r\ndestroying angel.[1868]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1862: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 147-150.

And do this lest by failure of the said\r\n     powder and other habiliments of war, the siege should be\r\n     long and ye should be called in this matter negligent or\r\n     unwilling.

Perot (_Bulletin de la Societe archeologique de\r\nl'Orleanais_, vol. xii, p. 231).]\r\n\r\nThe folk of Orleans, on the other hand, once more appeared both\r\nzealous and munificent; for they eagerly desired the reduction of a\r\ntown commanding the Loire for seventy-five miles above their own city.\r\nThey deserve to be considered the true deliverers of the kingdom; had\r\nit not been for them neither Jargeau nor Beaugency would have been\r\ntaken in June. Quite in the beginning of July, when they thought the\r\nLoire campaign was to be continued, they had sent their great mortar,\r\nLa Bougue, to Gien. With it they had despatched ammunition and\r\nvictuals; and now, in the early days of December, at the request of\r\nthe King addressed to the magistrates, they sent to La Charite all the\r\nartillery brought back from Gien; likewise eighty-nine soldiers of the\r\nmunicipal troops, wearing the cloak with the Duke of Orleans' colours,\r\nthe white cross on the breast; with their trumpeter at their head and\r\ncommanded by Captain Boiau; craftsmen of all conditions, master-masons\r\nand journeymen, carpenters, smiths; the cannoneers Fauveau, Gervaise\r\nLefevre and Brother Jacques, monk of the Gray friars monastery, at\r\nOrleans.[1872] What became of all this artillery and of these brave\r\nfolk?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1872: A. de Villaret, _Campagne des Anglais_, p. 107, proofs\r\nand illustrations, xvii, pp. 159, 168. _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 268, 270,\r\naccording to the original documents in the Orleans Library.]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of November, the Sire d'Albret and the Maid, being hard\r\nput to it before the walls of La Charite, likewise solicited the town\r\nof Bourges. On receipt of their letter, the burgesses decided to\r\ncontribute thirteen hundred golden crowns. To raise this sum they had\r\nrecourse to a measure by no means unusual; it had been employed\r\nnotably by the townsfolk of Orleans when, some time previously, to\r\nfurnish forth Jeanne with munition of war, they had bought from a\r\ncertain citizen a quantity of salt which they had put up to auction\r\nin the city barn. The townsfolk of Bourges sold by auction the annual\r\nrevenue of a thirteenth part of the wine sold retail in the town. But\r\nthe money thus raised never reached its destination.[1873]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1873: La Thaumassiere, _Histoire du Berry_, p. 161. _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 356, 357. Lanery d'Arc and L.

At the end\r\nof a month Perrinet Gressart, who was full of craft, caused them to\r\nfall into an ambush. They raised the siege, abandoning the artillery\r\nfurnished by the good towns, those fine cannon bought with the savings\r\nof thrifty citizens.[1875] Their action was the less excusable because\r\nthe town which had not been relieved and could not well expect to be,\r\nmust have surrendered sooner or later. They pleaded that the King had\r\nsent them no victuals and no money;[1876] but that was not considered\r\nan excuse and their action was deemed dishonourable. According to a\r\nknight well acquainted with points of honour in war: \"One ought never\r\nto besiege a place without being sure of victuals and of pay\r\nbeforehand. For to besiege a stronghold and then to withdraw is great\r\ndisgrace for an army, especially when there is present with it a king\r\nor a king's lieutenant.\"[1877]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1874: _Memoires de la Societe des Antiquaires du Centre_,\r\nvol. iv, 1870-1872, pp. 211, 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1875: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, p. 126.

He took as his text the great miracles worked in France by\r\nthe intervention of a Maid, whom God had sent to the King. On this\r\noccasion the Mayor and the magistrates heard mass sung and presented\r\ntwo candles. Now for two months Brother Helie had been under order to\r\nappear before the Parlement of Poitiers.[1878] On what charge we do not\r\nknow. Mendicant monks of those days were for the most part irregular\r\nin faith and in morals. The doctrine of Friar Richard himself was not\r\naltogether beyond suspicion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1878: Extract from the Book of Accounts of the town of\r\nPerigueux, in _Bulletin de la Societe historique et archeologique du\r\nPerigord_, vol. xiv, January to February, 1887.

Chapotin,\r\n_La guerre de cent ans et les dominicains_, pp. 74 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, in the year 1429, the flying squadron of _beguines_\r\nbeing assembled at Jargeau,[1879] this good Brother said mass and\r\nadministered the communion thrice to Jeanne the Maid and twice to that\r\nPierronne of Lower Brittany, with whom our Lord conversed as friend\r\nwith friend. Such an action might well be regarded, if not as a formal\r\nviolation of the Church's laws, at any rate as an unjustifiable abuse\r\nof the sacrament.[1880] A menacing theological tempest was then\r\ngathering and was about to break over the heads of Friar Richard's\r\ndaughters in the spirit. A few days after the attack on Paris, the\r\nvenerable University had had composed or rather transcribed a\r\ntreatise, _De bono et maligno spiritu_, with a view probably to\r\nfinding therein arguments against Friar Richard and his prophetess\r\nJeanne, who had both appeared before the city with the Armagnacs.[1881]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1879: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1880: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1881: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 232, 233. Le P. Denifle and\r\nChatelain, _Cartularium Univ. Paris_, vol. iv, p. 515.]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, a clerk of the faculty of law had published a\r\nsummary reply to Chancellor Gerson's memorial concerning the Maid. \"It\r\nsufficeth not,\" he wrote, \"that one simply affirm that he is sent of\r\nGod; every heretic maketh such a claim; but he must prove the truth of\r\nthat mysterious mission by some miraculous work or by some special\r\ntestimony in the Bible.\" This Paris clerk denies that the Maid has\r\npresented any such proof, and to judge her by her acts, he believes\r\nher rather to have been sent by the Devil than by God. He reproaches\r\nher with wearing a dress forbidden to women under penalty of anathema,\r\nand he refutes the excuses for her conduct in this matter urged by\r\nGerson. He accuses her of having excited between princes and Christian\r\npeople a greater war than there had ever been before. He holds her to\r\nbe an idolatress using enchantments and making false prophecies. He\r\ncharges her with having induced men to slay their fellows on the two\r\nhigh festivals of the Holy Virgin, the Assumption and the Nativity.\r\n\"Sins committed by the Enemy of Mankind, through this woman, against\r\nthe Creator and his most glorious Mother. And albeit there ensued\r\ncertain murders, thanks be to God they were not so many as the Enemy\r\nhad intended.\"\r\n\r\n\"All these things do manifestly prove error and heresy,\" adds this\r\ndevout son of the University. Whence he concludes that the Maid\r\nshould be taken before the Bishop and the Inquisitor; and he ends by\r\nquoting this text from Saint Jerome: \"The unhealthy flesh must be cut\r\noff; the diseased sheep must be driven from the fold.\"[1882]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1882: Noel Valois, _Un nouveau temoignage sur Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nParis, 1907, in 8vo, 19 pages.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the unanimous opinion of the University of Paris concerning\r\nher in whom the French clerks beheld an Angel of the Lord. At Bruges,\r\nin November, a rumour ran and was eagerly welcomed by ecclesiastics\r\nthat the University of Paris had sent an embassy to the Pope at Rome\r\nto denounce the Maid as a false prophetess and a deceiver, and\r\nlikewise those who believed in her. We do not know the veritable\r\nobject of this mission.[1883] But there is no doubt whatever that the\r\ndoctors and masters of Paris were henceforward firmly resolved that if\r\never they obtained possession of the damsel they would not let her go\r\nout of their hands, and certainly would not send her to be tried at\r\nRome, where she might escape with a mere penance, and even be enlisted\r\nas one of the Pope's mercenaries.[1884]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1883: Morosini, vol. iii, p. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1884: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 354, 355.]\r\n\r\nIn English and Burgundian lands, not only by clerks but by folk of all\r\nconditions, she was regarded as a heretic; in those countries the few\r\nwho thought well of her had to conceal their opinions carefully. After\r\nthe retreat from Saint-Denys, there may have remained some in Picardy,\r\nand notably at Abbeville, who were favourable to the prophetess of the\r\nFrench; but such persons must not be spoken of in public.\r\n\r\nColin Gouye, surnamed Le Sourd, and Jehannin Daix, surnamed Le Petit,\r\na man of Abbeville, learned this to their cost. In this town about\r\nthe middle of September, Le Sourd and Le Petit were near the\r\nblacksmith's forge with divers of the burgesses and other townsfolk,\r\namong whom was a herald. They fell to talking of the Maid who was\r\nmaking so great a stir throughout Christendom. To certain words the\r\nherald uttered concerning her, Le Petit replied eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Well! well! Everything that woman does and says is nought but\r\ndeception.\"\r\n\r\nLe Sourd spoke likewise: \"That woman,\" he said, \"is not to be trusted.\r\nThose who believe in her are mad, and there is a smell of burning\r\nabout them.\"[1885]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1885: _Sentent la persinee_: literally, smell of roast\r\nparsley. Cf. Godefroy, _Lexique de l'ancien francais_ at the word\r\n_persinee_. _Sentir la persinee_: to be suspected of heresy (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nBy that he meant that their destiny was obvious, and that they were\r\nsure to be burned at the stake as heretics.\r\n\r\nThen he had the misfortune to add: \"In this town there be many with a\r\nsmell of burning about them.\"\r\n\r\nSuch words were for the dwellers in Abbeville a slander and a cause of\r\nsuspicion. When the Mayor and the aldermen heard of this speech they\r\nordered Le Sourd to be thrown into prison. Le Petit must have said\r\nsomething similar, for he too was imprisoned.[1886]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1886: Pardon granted to Le Sourd and Jehannin Daix, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 142-145.]\r\n\r\nBy saying that divers of his fellow-citizens were suspect of heresy,\r\nLe Sourd put them in danger of being sought out by the Bishop and the\r\nInquisitor as heretics and sorcerers of notoriously evil repute. As\r\nfor the Maid, she must have been suspect indeed, for a smell of\r\nburning to be caused by the mere fact of being her partisan.\r\n\r\nWhile Friar Richard and his spiritual daughters were thus threatened\r\nwith a bad end should they fall into the hands of the English or\r\nBurgundians, serious troubles were agitating the sisterhood. On the\r\nsubject of Catherine, Jeanne entered into an open dispute with her\r\nspiritual father. Friar Richard wanted the holy dame of La Rochelle to\r\nbe set to work. Fearing lest his advice should be adopted, Jeanne\r\nwrote to her King to tell him what to do with the woman, to wit that\r\nhe should send her home to her husband and children.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to the King the first thing she had to say to him was:\r\n\"Catherine's doings are nought but folly and futility.\"\r\n\r\nFriar Richard made no attempt to hide from the Maid his profound\r\ndispleasure.[1887] He was thought much of at court, and it was\r\ndoubtless with the consent of the Royal Council that he was\r\nendeavouring to compass the employment of Dame Catherine. The Maid had\r\nsucceeded. Why should not another of the illuminated succeed?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1887: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Council had by no means renounced the services Jeanne\r\nwas rendering to the French cause. Even after the misfortunes of Paris\r\nand of La Charite, there were many who now as before held her power to\r\nbe supernatural; and there is reason to believe that there was a party\r\nat Court intending still to employ her.[1888] And even if they had\r\nwished to discard her she was now too intimately associated with the\r\nroyal lilies for her rejection not to involve them too in dishonour.\r\nOn the 29th of December, 1429, at Mehun-sur-Yevre, the King gave her a\r\ncharter of nobility sealed with the great seal in green wax, with a\r\ndouble pendant, on a strip of red and green silk.[1889]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1888: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 84; vol. iv, pp. 312 _et passim_.\r\nA. de Villaret, _loc. cit._ Proofs and illustrations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1889: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 150-153.

It\r\nwas a singular grant corresponding to the singular services rendered\r\nby a woman.\r\n\r\nIn the title she is described as Johanna d'Ay, doubtless because her\r\nfather's name was given to the King's scribes by Lorrainers who would\r\nspeak with a soft drawl; but whether her name were Ay or Arc, she was\r\nseldom called by it, and was commonly spoken of as Jeanne the\r\nMaid.[1890]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1890: See analytical index, in _Trial_, vol. v, at the word\r\n_Pucelle_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE CITIZENS OF REIMS--LETTER TO THE HUSSITES--DEPARTURE\r\nFROM SULLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe folk of Orleans were grateful to the Maid for what she had done\r\nfor them. Far from reproaching her with the unfortunate conclusion of\r\nthe siege of La Charite, they welcomed her into their city with the\r\nsame rejoicing and with as good cheer as before. On the 19th of\r\nJanuary, 1430, they honoured her and likewise Maitre Jean de Velly and\r\nMaitre Jean Rabateau with a banquet, at which there was abundance of\r\ncapons, partridges, hares, and even a pheasant.[1891] Who that Jean de\r\nVelly was, who was feasted with her, we do not know. As for Jean\r\nRabateau, he was none other than the King's Councillor, who had been\r\nAttorney-General at the Parlement of Poitiers since 1427.[1892] He had\r\nbeen the Maid's host at Orleans. His wife had often seen Jeanne\r\nkneeling in her private oratory.[1893] The citizens of Orleans offered\r\nwine to the Attorney-General, to Jean de Velly, and to the Maid. In\r\ngood sooth, 'twas a fine feast and a ceremonious. The burgesses loved\r\nand honoured Jeanne, but they cannot have observed her very closely\r\nduring the repast or they would not eight years later, when an\r\nadventuress gave herself out to be the Maid, have mistaken her for\r\nJeanne, and offered her wine in the same manner and at the hands of\r\nthe same city servant, Jacques Leprestre, as now presented it.[1894]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1891: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1892: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 19, 74, 203.

He was now\r\nmarrying his daughter Heliote; and when Jeanne heard of it, she sent a\r\nletter to the magistrates of Tours, asking them to give a sum of one\r\nhundred crowns for the bride's trousseau. The nuptials were fixed for\r\nthe 9th of February, 1430. The magistrates assembled twice to\r\ndeliberate on Jeanne's request. They described her honourably and yet\r\nnot without a certain caution as \"the Maid who hath come into this\r\nrealm to the King, concerning the matter of the war, announcing that\r\nshe is sent by the King of Heaven against the English.\" In the end\r\nthey refused to pay anything, because, they said, it behoved them to\r\nexpend municipal funds on municipal matters and not otherwise; but\r\nthey decided that for the affection and honour they bore the Maid, the\r\nchurchmen, burgesses, and other townsfolk should be present in the\r\nchurch at the wedding, and should offer prayers for the bride and\r\npresent her with bread and wine. This cost them four _livres_, ten\r\n_sous_.[1895]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1895: Vallet de Viriville, _Un episode de la vie de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, vol. iv (1st\r\nseries), p. 488. _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 154-156.]\r\n\r\nAt a time which it is impossible to fix exactly the Maid bought a\r\nhouse at Orleans. To be more precise she took it on lease.[1896] A\r\nlease (_bail a vente_) was an agreement by which the proprietor of a\r\nhouse or other property transferred the ownership to the lessee in\r\nreturn for an annual payment in kind or in money. The duration of such\r\nleases was usually fifty-nine years. The house that Jeanne acquired in\r\nthis manner belonged to the Chapter of the Cathedral. It was in the\r\ncentre of the town, in the parish of Saint-Malo, close to the\r\nSaint-Maclou Chapel, next door to the shop of an oil-seller, one Jean\r\nFeu, in the Rue des Petits-Souliers. It was in this street that,\r\nduring the siege, there had fallen into the midst of five guests\r\nseated at table a stone cannon-ball weighing one hundred and\r\nsixty-four pounds, which had done no one any harm.[1897] What price did\r\nthe Maid give for this house? Apparently six crowns of fine gold (at\r\nsixty crowns to the mark), due half-yearly at Midsummer and Christmas,\r\nfor fifty-nine years. In addition, she must according to custom have\r\nundertaken to keep the house in good condition and to pay out of her\r\nown purse the ecclesiastical dues as well as rates for wells and\r\npaving and all other taxes. Being obliged to have some one as surety,\r\nshe chose as her guarantor a certain Guillot de Guyenne, of whom we\r\nknow nothing further.[1898]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1896: Jules Doinel, _Note sur une maison de Jeanne d'Arc_, in\r\n_Memoires de la Societe archeologique et historique de l'Orleanais_,\r\nvol. xv, pp. 491-500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1897: _Journal du siege_, pp. 15, 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1898: Jules Doinel, _Note sur une maison de Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\n_loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the Maid did not herself negotiate\r\nthis agreement. Saint as she was, she knew well what it was to possess\r\nproperty. Such knowledge ran in her family; her father was the best\r\nbusiness man in his village.[1899] She herself was domesticated and\r\nthrifty; for she kept her old clothes, and even in the field she knew\r\nwhere to find them when she wanted to make presents of them to her\r\nfriends. She counted up her possessions in arms and horses, valued\r\nthem at twelve thousand crowns, and, apparently made a pretty accurate\r\nreckoning.[1900] But what was her idea in taking this house? Did she\r\nthink of living in it? Did she intend when the war was over to return\r\nto Orleans and pass a peaceful old age in a house of her own? Or was\r\nshe planning for her parents to dwell there, or some Vouthon uncle, or\r\nher brothers, one of whom was in great poverty and had got a doublet\r\nout of the citizens of Orleans?[1901]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1899: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1900: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 295.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1901: Accounts of the fortress, in _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 259,\r\n260.]\r\n\r\nOn the third of March she followed King Charles to Sully.[1902] The\r\nchateau, in which she lodged near the King, belonged to the Sire de la\r\nTremouille, who had inherited it from his mother, Marie de Sully, the\r\ndaughter of Louis I of Bourbon. It had been recaptured from the\r\nEnglish after the deliverance of Orleans.[1903] A stronghold on the\r\nLoire, on the highroad from Paris to Autun, and commanding the plain\r\nbetween Orleans and Briare and the ancient bridge with twenty arches,\r\nthe chateau of Sully linked together central France and those northern\r\nprovinces which Jeanne had so regretfully quitted, and whither with\r\nall her heart she longed to return to engage in fresh expeditions and\r\nfresh sieges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1902: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1903: Perceval de Cagny, p. 173. _Chronique de la Pucelle_,\r\np. 258. _Berry_, in Godefroy, p. 376.

Not being able to keep their promise and deliver to him\r\nCompiegne which refused to be delivered, the French offered him in its\r\nplace Pont-Sainte-Maxence.[1906] But it was Compiegne that he wanted.\r\nThe truces, which had been very imperfectly kept, were to have expired\r\nat Christmas, but first they had been prolonged till the 15th of March\r\nand then till Easter. In the year 1430 Easter fell on the 16th of\r\nApril; and Duke Philip was only waiting for that date to put an army\r\nin the field.[1907]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1904: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 378. D.

Jehenne the\r\n     Maid hath received your letters making mention that ye fear\r\n     a siege. Know ye that it shall not so betide, and I may but\r\n     encounter them shortly. And if I do not encounter them and\r\n     they do not come to you, if you shut your gates firmly, I\r\n     shall shortly be with you: and if they be there, I shall\r\n     make them put on their spurs so hastily that they will not\r\n     know where to take them and so quickly that it shall be very\r\n     soon. Other things I will not write unto you now, save that\r\n     ye be always good and loyal. I pray God to have you in his\r\n     keeping. Written at Sully, the 16th day of March.\r\n\r\n     I would announce unto you other tidings at which ye would\r\n     mightily rejoice; but I fear lest the letters be taken on\r\n     the road, and the said tidings be seen.\r\n\r\n     Signed. Jehanne.\r\n\r\n     _Addressed_ to my dear friends and beloved, churchmen,\r\n     burgesses and other citizens of the town of Rains.\"[1908]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1908: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 160, according to Rogier's copy. H.\r\nJadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, proofs and illustrations xv. Facsimile\r\nin Wallon, 1876 edition, p. 200. The original of this letter exists,\r\nlikewise the original of the letter addressed on the 9th of November,\r\n1429, to the citizens of Riom. These two letters, about one hundred\r\nand twenty-six days apart, are not written by the same scribe. The\r\nsignature of neither one nor the other can be attributed to the hand\r\nwhich indited the rest of the letter. The seven letters of the name\r\n_Jehanne_ seem to have been written by some one whose hand was being\r\nheld, which is not surprising, seeing that the Maid did not know how\r\nto write. But a comparison of the two signatures reveals their close\r\nsimilarity. In both the stem of the J slopes in the same direction and\r\nis of identical length; the first _n_ through one letter being written\r\non the top of another has three pothooks instead of two; the second\r\npothook of the second _n_ obviously written in two strokes is too\r\nlong, in short the two signatures correspond exactly. We must conclude\r\ntherefore that having once obtained the Maid's signature by guiding\r\nher hand, an impression was taken to serve as a model for all her\r\nother letters. To judge from the two missives of the 9th of November,\r\n1429 and the 16th of March, 1430, this impression was most faithfully\r\nreproduced. Cf. _post_, p. 117, note 2.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the scribe wrote this letter faithfully as\r\nit was dictated by the Maid, and that he wrote her words as they fell\r\nfrom her lips. In her haste she now and again forgot words and\r\nsometimes whole phrases; but the sense is clear all the same. And what\r\nconfidence! \"You will have no siege if I encounter the enemy.\" How\r\ncompletely is this the language of chivalry! On the eve of Patay she\r\nhad asked: \"Have you good spurs?\"[1909] Here she cries: \"I will make\r\nthem put on their spurs.\" She says that soon she will be in Champagne,\r\nthat she is about to start. Surely we can no longer think of her shut\r\nup in the Castle of La Tremouille as in a kind of gilded cage.[1910] In\r\nconclusion, she tells her friends at Reims that she does not write\r\nunto them all that she would like for fear lest her letter should be\r\ncaptured on the road. She knew what it was to be cautious. Sometimes\r\nshe affixed a cross to her letters to warn her followers to pay no\r\nheed to what she wrote, in the hope that the missive would be\r\nintercepted and the enemy deceived.[1911]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1909: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1910: Perceval de Cagny, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1911: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nIt was from Sully that on the 23rd of March Brother Pasquerel sent the\r\nEmperor Sigismund a letter intended for the Hussites of Bohemia.[1912]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1912: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 156.]\r\n\r\nThe Hussites of those days were abhorred and execrated throughout\r\nChristendom. They demanded the free preaching of God's word, communion\r\nin both kinds, and the return of the Church to that evangelical life\r\nwhich allowed neither the wealth of priests nor the temporal power of\r\npopes. They desired the punishment of sin by the civil magistrates, a\r\ncustom which could prevail only in very holy society. They were saints\r\nindeed and heretics too on every possible point. Pope Martin held the\r\ndestruction of these wicked persons to be salutary, and such was the\r\nopinion of every good Catholic. But how could this armed heresy be\r\ndealt with when it routed all the forces of the Empire and the Holy\r\nSee? The Hussites were too much for that worn-out ancient chivalry of\r\nChristendom, for the knighthood of France and of Germany, which was\r\ngood for nothing but to be thrown on to the refuse heaps like so much\r\nold iron. And this was precisely what the towns of the realm of France\r\ndid when over these knights of chivalry they placed a peasant\r\ngirl.[1913]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1913: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 24, 86, 87. J. Zeller,\r\n_Histoire d'Allemagne_, vol. vii, _La reforme_, Paris, 1891, pp. 78\r\n_et seq._ E. Denis, _Jean Hus et la guerre des Hussites_ (1879); _Les\r\norigines de l'Unite des Freres Bohemes_, Angers, 1885, in 8vo, pp. 5\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nAt Tachov, in 1427, the Crusaders, blessed by the Holy Father, had\r\nfled at the mere sound of the chariot wheels of the Procops.[1914] Pope\r\nMartin knew not where to turn for defenders of Holy Church, one and\r\nindivisible. He had paid for the armament of five thousand English\r\ncrusaders, which the Cardinal of Winchester was to lead against these\r\naccursed Bohemians; but in this force the Holy Father was cruelly\r\ndisappointed; hardly had his five thousand crusaders landed in France,\r\nthan the Regent of England diverted them from their route and sent\r\nthem to Brie to occupy the attention of the Maid of the\r\nArmagnacs.[1915]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1914: Two of the great leaders of the Hussites who held large\r\nparts of central Germany in terror from 1419-1434 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1915: L. Paris, _Cabinet historique_, vol. i, 1855, pp. 74,\r\n76. Rogier, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 294. Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 132,\r\n133, 136, 137, 168, 169, 188, 189; vol. iv, supplement, xvii.]\r\n\r\nSince her coming into France Jeanne had spoken of the crusade as a\r\nwork good and meritorious. In the letter dictated before the\r\nexpedition to Orleans, she summoned the English to join the French and\r\ngo together to fight against the Church's foe. And later, writing to\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, she invited the son of the Duke vanquished at\r\nNicopolis to make war against the Turks.[1916] Who but the mendicants\r\ndirecting her can have put these crusading ideas into Jeanne's head?\r\nImmediately after the deliverance of Orleans it was said that she\r\nwould lead King Charles to the conquest of the Holy Sepulchre and that\r\nshe would die in the Holy Land.[1917] At the same time it was rumoured\r\nthat she would make war on the Hussites. In the month of July, 1429,\r\nwhen the coronation campaign had barely begun, it was proclaimed in\r\nGermany, on the faith of a prophetess of Rome, that by a prophetess of\r\nFrance the Bohemian kingdom should be recovered.[1918]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1916: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 240; vol. v, p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1917: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 82-85. Christine de Pisan, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, p. 416. Eberhard Windecke, pp. 60-63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1918: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 108, 115, 188.]\r\n\r\nAlready zealous for the Crusade against the Turks, the Maid was now\r\nequally eager for the Crusade against the Hussites. Turks or\r\nBohemians, it was all alike to her. Of one and the other her only\r\nknowledge lay in the stories full of witchcraft related to her by the\r\nmendicants of her company. Touching the Hussites, stories were told,\r\nnot all true, but which Jeanne must have believed; and they cannot\r\nhave pleased her. It was said that they worshipped the devil, and that\r\nthey called him \"the wronged one.\" It was told that as works of piety\r\nthey committed all manner of fornication. Every Bohemian was said to\r\nbe possessed by a hundred demons. They were accused of killing\r\nthousands of churchmen. Again, and this time with truth, they were\r\ncharged with burning churches and monasteries. The Maid believed in\r\nthe God who commanded Israel to wipe out the Philistines from the face\r\nof the earth. But recently there had arisen Cathari who held the God\r\nof the Old Testament to be none other than Lucifer or Luciabelus,\r\nauthor of evil, liar and murderer. The Cathari abhorred war; they\r\nrefused to shed blood; they were heretics; they had been massacred,\r\nand none remained. The Maid believed in good faith that the\r\nextirpation of the Hussites was a work pleasing to God. Men more\r\nlearned than she, not like her addicted to chivalry, but of gentle\r\nlife, clerks like the Chancellor Jean Gerson, believed it\r\nlikewise.[1919] Of these Bohemian heretics she thought what every one\r\nthought: her opinions were those of the multitude; her views were\r\nmodelled on public opinion. Wherefore in all the simplicity of her\r\nheart she hated the Hussites, but she feared them not, because she\r\nfeared nothing and because she believed, God helping her, that she was\r\nable to overcome all the English, all the Turks, and all the Bohemians\r\nin the world. At the first trumpet call she was ready to sally forth\r\nagainst them. On the 23rd of March, 1430, Brother Pasquerel sent the\r\nEmperor Sigismund a letter written in the name of the Maid and\r\nintended for the Hussites of Bohemia. This letter was indited in\r\nLatin. The following is the purport of it:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1919: Lea, _A History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 481 (1906).]\r\n\r\n     JESUS [cross symbol] MARIE\r\n\r\n     Long ago there reached me the tidings that ye from the true\r\n     Christians that ye once were have become heretics, like unto\r\n     the Saracens, that ye have abolished true religion and\r\n     worship and have turned to a superstition corrupt and fatal,\r\n     the which in your zeal to maintain and to spread abroad\r\n     there be no shame nor cruelty ye do not dare to perpetrate.\r\n     You defile the sacraments of the Church, tear to pieces the\r\n     articles of her faith, overthrow her temples. The images\r\n     which were made for similitudes you break and throw into the\r\n     fire. Finally such Christians as embrace not your faith you\r\n     massacre. What fury, what folly, what rage possesses you?\r\n     That religion which God the All Powerful, which the Son,\r\n     which the Holy Ghost raised up, instituted, exalted and\r\n     revealed in a thousand manners, by a thousand miracles, ye\r\n     persecute, ye employ all arts to overturn and to\r\n     exterminate.\r\n\r\n     It is you, you who are blind and not those who have not eyes\r\n     nor sight. Think ye that ye will go unpunished? Do ye not\r\n     know that if God prevent not your impious violence, if he\r\n     suffer you to grope on in darkness and in error, it is that\r\n     he is preparing for you a greater sorrow and a greater\r\n     punishment? As for me, in good sooth, were I not occupied\r\n     with the English wars, I would have already come against\r\n     you. But in very deed if I learn not that ye have turned\r\n     from your wicked ways, I will peradventure leave the English\r\n     and hasten against you, in order that I may destroy by the\r\n     sword your vain and violent superstition, if I can do so in\r\n     no other manner, and that I may rid you either of heresy or\r\n     of life. Notwithstanding, if you prefer to return to the\r\n     Catholic faith and to the light of primitive days, send unto\r\n     me your ambassadors and I will tell them what ye must do. If\r\n     on the other hand ye will be stiff-necked and kick against\r\n     the pricks, then remember all the crimes and offences ye\r\n     have perpetrated and look for to see me coming unto you with\r\n     all strength divine and human to render unto you again all\r\n     the evil ye have done unto others.\r\n\r\n     Given at Sully, on the 23rd of March, to the Bohemian\r\n     heretics.\r\n\r\n     Signed. Pasquerel.[1920]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1920: Th. de Sickel, _Lettre de Jeanne d'Arc aux Hussites_,\r\nin _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, 3rd series, vol. ii, p. 81.\r\nA wrong date is given in the German translation used by Quicherat,\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 156-159.]\r\n\r\nThis was the letter sent to the Emperor. How had Jeanne really\r\nexpressed herself in her dialect savouring alike of the speech of\r\nChampagne and of that of l'Ile de France? There can be no doubt but\r\nthat her letter had been sadly embellished by the good Brother. Such\r\nCiceronian language cannot have proceeded from the Maid. It is all\r\nvery well to say that a saint of those days could do everything, could\r\nprophesy on any subject and in any tongue, so fine an epistle remains\r\nfar too rhetorical to have been composed by a damsel whom even the\r\nArmagnac captains considered simple. Nevertheless, a careful\r\nexamination will reveal in this missive, at any rate in the second\r\nhalf of it, certain of those bluntly naive passages and some of that\r\nchildish assurance which are noticeable in Jeanne's genuine letters,\r\nespecially in her reply to the Count of Armagnac;[1921] and more than\r\nonce there occurs an expression characteristic of a village sibyl. The\r\nfollowing, for example, is quite in Jeanne's own manner: \"If you will\r\nreturn to the bosom of the Catholic Church, send me your ambassadors;\r\nI will tell you what you have to do.\" And her usual threat: \"Expect me\r\nwith all strength human and divine.\"[1922] As for the phrase: \"If I\r\nhear not shortly of your conversion, of your return to the bosom of\r\nthe Church, I will peradventure leave the English and come against\r\nyou,\" here we may suspect the mendicant friar, less interested in the\r\naffairs of Charles VII than in those of the Church, of having ascribed\r\nto the Maid greater eagerness to set forth on the Crusade than she\r\nreally felt. Good and salutary as she deemed the taking of the Cross,\r\nas far as we know her, she would never have consented to take it until\r\nshe had driven the English out of the realm of France. She believed\r\nthis to be her mission, and the persistence, the consistency, the\r\nstrength of will she evinced in its fulfilment, are truly admirable.\r\nIt is quite probable that she dictated to the good Brother some phrase\r\nlike: \"When I have put the English out of the kingdom, I will turn\r\nagainst you.\" This would explain and excuse Brother Pasquerel's error.\r\nIt is very likely that Jeanne believed she would dispose of the\r\nEnglish in a trice and that she already saw herself distributing good\r\nbuffets and sound clouts to the renegade and infidel Bohemians. The\r\nMaid's simplicity makes itself felt through the clerk's Latin. This\r\nepistle to the Bohemians recalls, alas! that fagot placed upon the\r\nstake whereon John Huss was burning, by the pious zeal of the good\r\nwife whose saintly simplicity John Huss himself teaches us to admire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1921: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1922: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nOne cannot help reflecting that Jeanne and those very men against whom\r\nshe hurled menace and invective had much in common; alike they were\r\nimpelled by faith, chastity, simple ignorance, pious duty, resignation\r\nto God's will, and a tendency to magnify the minor matters of\r\ndevotion. Zizka[1923] had established in his camp that purity of morals\r\nwhich the Maid was endeavouring to introduce among the Armagnacs. The\r\npeasant soldiers of Bohemia and the peasant Maid of France bearing her\r\nsword amidst mendicant monks had much in common. On the one hand and\r\non the other, we have the religious spirit in the place of the\r\npolitical spirit, the fear of sin in the place of obedience to the\r\ncivil law, the spiritual introduced into the temporal. Here is indeed\r\na woeful sight and a piteous; the devout set one against the other,\r\nthe innocent against the innocent, the simple against the simple, the\r\nheretic against heretics; and it is painful to think that when she is\r\nthreatening with extermination the disciples of that John Huss, who\r\nhad been treacherously taken and burned as a heretic, she herself is\r\non the point of being sold to her enemies and condemned to suffer as a\r\nwitch. It would have been different if this letter, at which the\r\naccomplished wits and humorists of the day looked askance, had won the\r\napproval of theologians. But they also found fault with it, an\r\nillustrious canonist, a zealous inquisitor deemed highly presumptuous\r\nthis threatening of a multitude of men by a Maid.[1924]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1923: Another of the Hussite leaders (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1924: J. Nider, _Formicarium_ in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp.\r\n502-504.]\r\n\r\nWe were right in saying that she was not prepared to leave the English\r\nimmediately and hasten against the Bohemians. Five days after her\r\nappeal to the Hussites she wrote to her friends at Reims and in\r\nmysterious words gave them to understand that she would come to them\r\nshortly.[1925]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1925: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 161, 162.]\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Duke Philip were at that time hatching plots in the\r\ntowns of Champagne, notably at Troyes and at Reims. On the 22nd of\r\nFebruary, 1430, a canon and a chaplain were arrested and brought\r\nbefore the chapter for having conspired to deliver the city to the\r\nEnglish. It was well for them that they belonged to the Church, for\r\nhaving been condemned to perpetual imprisonment, they obtained from\r\nthe King a mitigation of their sentence, and the canon a complete\r\nremittance.[1926] The aldermen and ecclesiastics of the city, fearing\r\nthey would be thought badly of on the other side of the Loire, wrote\r\nto the Maid entreating her to speak well of them to the King. The\r\nfollowing is her reply to their request:[1927]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1926: _Ibid._, vol. iv, p. 299, and H.

Quicherat, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 161, 162, and by M. H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, pp.\r\n106, 107 and document XVI, according to Rogier's inaccurate copy. The\r\noriginal which had disappeared from the municipal archives at Reims\r\nwas considered to be lost; but it has been found in the possession of\r\nthe Count de Maleissye.

Therefore I give you\r\n     to wit that it is indeed true that even such things have\r\n     been reported to him and that he grieves much that there be\r\n     folk in alliance with the Burgundians; that they would\r\n     betray the town and bring the Burgundians into it. But since\r\n     then the King has known the contrary by means of the\r\n     assurance ye have sent him, and he is well pleased with you.\r\n     And ye may believe that ye stand well in his favour; and if\r\n     ye have need, he would help you with regard to the siege;\r\n     and he knows well that ye have much to suffer from the\r\n     hardness of those treacherous Burgundians, your adversaries:\r\n     thus may God in his pleasure deliver you shortly, that is as\r\n     soon as may be. So I pray and entreat you my friends dearly\r\n     beloved that ye hold well the said city for the King and\r\n     that ye keep good watch. Ye will soon have good tidings of\r\n     me at greater length. Other things for the present I write\r\n     not unto you save that the whole of Brittany is French and\r\n     that the Duke is to send to the King three thousand\r\n     combatants paid for two months. To God I commend you, may he\r\n     keep you.\r\n\r\n     Written at Sully, the 28th of March.\r\n\r\n     Jehanne.[1928]\r\n\r\n     Addressed to: My good friends and dearly beloved, the\r\n     churchmen, aldermen, burgesses and inhabitants and masters\r\n     of the good town of Reyms.\"[1929]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1928: The signature appears to be autograph.

Jadart, _Jeanne\r\nd'Arc a Reims_, pp. 106, 107.]\r\n\r\nTouching the succour to be expected from the Duke of Brittany, the\r\nMaid was labouring under a delusion. Like all other prophetesses she\r\nwas ignorant of what was passing around her. Despite her failures, she\r\nbelieved in her good fortune; she doubted herself no more than she\r\ndoubted God; and she was eager to pursue the fulfilment of her\r\nmission. \"Ye shall soon have tidings of me,\" she said to the townsfolk\r\nof Reims. A few days after, and she left Sully to go into France and\r\nfight, on the expiration of the truces.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that she feigned an expedition of pleasure and set\r\nout without taking leave of the King, that it was a kind of innocent\r\nstratagem, an honourable flight.[1930] But it was nothing of the\r\nsort.[1931] The Maid gathered a company of some hundred horse,\r\nsixty-eight archers and cross-bowmen, and two trumpeters, commanded by\r\na Lombard captain, Bartolomeo Baretta.[1932] In this company were\r\nItalian men-at-arms, bearing broad shields, like some who had come to\r\nOrleans at the time of the siege; possibly they were the same.[1933]\r\nShe set out at the head of this company, with her brothers and her\r\nsteward, the Sire Jean d'Aulon. She was in the hands of Jean d'Aulon,\r\nand Jean d'Aulon was in the hands of the Sire de la Tremouille, to\r\nwhom he owed money.[1934] The good squire would not have followed the\r\nMaid against the King's will.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1930: Perceval de Cagny, who was in the pay of the Duke of\r\nAlencon, is the only chronicler to suggest it, p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1931: \"In the year 1430, Jeanne the Maid started from the\r\ncountry of Berry accompanied by divers fighting men....\" Jean\r\nChartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1932: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 120.

True, the loan was made later; none the less the\r\ndependence of Jean d'Aulon on the Sire de la Tremouille existed at\r\nthis time.]\r\n\r\nThe flying squadron of _beguines_ had recently been divided by a\r\nschism. Friar Richard, who was then in high favour with Queen Marie,\r\nand who had preached the Lenten sermons of 1430[1935] at Orleans,\r\nstayed behind, on the Loire, with Catherine de la Rochelle. Jeanne\r\ntook with her Pierronne and the younger Breton prophetess.[1936] If she\r\nwent into France, it was not without the knowledge or against the will\r\nof the King and his Council. Very probably the Chancellor of the\r\nkingdom had asked La Tremouille to send her in order that he might\r\nemploy her in the approaching campaign against the Burgundians, who\r\nwere threatening his government of Beauvais and his city of\r\nReims.[1937] He was not very kindly disposed towards her, but already\r\nhe had made use of her and he intended to do so again. Possibly his\r\nintention was to employ her in a fresh attack on Paris.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1935: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 99, note. _Journal du siege_, pp.\r\n235, 238.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1936: This comes from the _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_,\r\np. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1937: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 159, 160.]\r\n\r\nThe King had not abandoned the idea of taking his great city by the\r\npeaceful methods he always preferred. Throughout Lent, between Sully\r\nand Paris, there had been a constant passing to and fro of certain\r\nCarmelite monks of Melun, disguised as artisans. These were the\r\nchurchmen who, during the attack on the Porte Saint Honore, on the Day\r\nof the Festival of Our Lady, had stirred up the popular rising which\r\nhad spread from one bank of the Seine to the other. Now they were\r\nnegotiating with certain influential citizens the entrance of the\r\nKing's men into the rebel city. The Prior of the Melun Carmelites was\r\ndirecting the conspiracy.[1938] There is reason to believe that Jeanne\r\nhad herself seen him or one of his monks. True it is that since the\r\n22nd or the 23rd of March it was known at Sully that the conspiracy\r\nhad been discovered;[1939] but perhaps the hope of success still\r\nlingered. It was to Melun that Jeanne went with her company; and it is\r\ndifficult to believe that there was no connection between the\r\nconspiracy of the Carmelites and the expedition of the Maid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1938: The Pardon of Jean de Calais in A. Longnon, _Paris sous\r\nla domination anglaise_, pp. 301-309. Stevenson, _Letters and Papers_,\r\nvol. i, pp. 34-50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1939: So it appears from Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 274-275.]\r\n\r\nWhy should Charles VII's Councillors have ceased to employ her? It\r\ncannot be said that she appeared less divine to the French or less\r\nevil to the English. Her failures, either unknown, or partially known,\r\nrendered unimportant by the fame of her victories, had not dispelled\r\nthe idea that within her resided invincible power. At the time when\r\nthe hapless damsel with the flower of French knighthood was receiving\r\nsore treatment under the walls of La Charite at the hands of an\r\nex-mason's apprentice, in Burgundian lands it was rumoured that she\r\nwas carrying by storm a castle twelve miles from Paris.[1940] She was\r\nstill considered miraculous; the burgesses, the men-at-arms of her\r\nparty still believed in her. And as for the _Godons_, from the Regent\r\nto the humblest swordsman of the army, they all regarded her with a\r\nterror as great as that which had possessed them at Orleans and Patay.\r\nAt this time so many English soldiers and captains refused to go to\r\nFrance, that a special edict was issued obliging them to do so.[1941]\r\nBut they doubtless discovered reasons enough for not going into a\r\ncountry where henceforth they could hope only for hard knocks and\r\nnothing tempting; so that many declined, terrified by the enchantments\r\nof the Maid.[1942]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1940: Morosini, vol. iii, pp. 228-231. Concerning Perrinet\r\nGressart see vol. i, p. 389.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1941: May 3, 1430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1942: G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La panique anglaise_.

The\r\ntruces have expired.[1944] Is it possible that the town which was\r\nsubject to King Charles[1945] can have refused to admit the Maid with\r\nher company when she came to it so generously? Apparently it was so.\r\nWas Jeanne able to communicate with the Carmelites of Melun? Probably.\r\nWhat misfortune befell her at the gates of the town? Did she suffer\r\nill treatment at the hands of a Burgundian band? We know not. But when\r\nshe was in the trenches she heard Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret\r\nsaying unto her: \"Thou wilt be taken before Saint John's Day.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1943: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 115, 253, April 17-23.

God will help\r\nthee.\"[1946]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1946: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 114-116. G. Leroy, _Histoire de\r\nMelun_, Melun, 1887, in 8vo, ch. xvi ... x ... [Transcriber's Note:\r\nellipses in original] _Jeanne d'Arc a Melun, mi-avril_, 1430, Melun,\r\n1896, 32 pp.]\r\n\r\nSaint John's Day was the 24th of June, in less than ten weeks. Many a\r\ntime after that, Jeanne asked her saints at what hour she would be\r\ntaken; but they did not tell her; and thus doubting she ceased to\r\nfollow her own ideas and consulted the captains.[1947]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1947: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nOn her way from Melun to Lagny-sur-Marne, in the month of May, she had\r\nto pass Corbeil. It was probably then, and in her company, that the\r\ntwo devout women from Lower Brittany, Pierronne and her younger sister\r\nin the spirit, were taken at Corbeil by the English.[1948]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1948: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 259.]\r\n\r\nFor eight months the town of Lagny had been subject to King Charles\r\nand governed by Messire Ambroise de Lore, who was energetically waging\r\nwar against the English of Paris and elsewhere.[1949] For the nonce\r\nMessire Ambroise de Lore was absent; but his lieutenant, Messire Jean\r\nFoucault, commanded the garrison. Shortly after Jeanne's coming to\r\nthis town, tidings were brought that a company of between three and\r\nfour hundred men of Picardy and of Champagne, fighting for the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, after having ranged through l'Ile de France, were now on\r\ntheir way back to Picardy with much booty. Their captain was a valiant\r\nman-at-arms, one Franquet d'Arras.[1950] The French determined to cut\r\noff their retreat. Under the command of Messire Jean Foucault, Messire\r\nGeoffroy de Saint-Bellin, Lord Hugh Kennedy, a Scotchman, and Captain\r\nBaretta, they sallied forth from the town.[1951]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1949: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, pp. 334, 335. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 110, 111. F.A. Denis, _Le sejour de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc a Lagny_, Lagny, 1894, in 8vo, pp. 3 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1950: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 384. Jean Chartier,\r\n_Chronique_, vol. i, pp. 120, 121. Perceval de Cagny, p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1951: Jean Chartier, _loc. cit._ Martial d'Auvergne,\r\n_Vigiles_, vol. i, p. 117. P. Champion, _Guillaume de Flavy_, p. 38,\r\nnote.]\r\n\r\nThe Maid went with them. They encountered the Burgundians near Lagny,\r\nbut failed to surprise them. Messire Franquet's archers had had time\r\nto take up their position with their backs to a hedge, in the English\r\nmanner. King Charles's men barely outnumbered the enemy. A certain\r\nclerk of that time, a Frenchman, writes of the engagement. His innate\r\ningeniousness was invincible. With candid common sense he states that\r\nthis very slight numerical superiority rendered the enterprise very\r\narduous and difficult for his party.[1952] And the battle was strong\r\nindeed. The Burgundians were mightily afraid of the Maid because they\r\nbelieved her to be a witch and in command of armies of devils;\r\nnotwithstanding, they fought right valiantly. Twice the French were\r\nrepulsed; but they returned to the attack, and finally the Burgundians\r\nwere all slain or taken.[1953]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1952: Jean Chartier, _Chronique_, vol. i, p. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1953: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 384.]\r\n\r\nThe conquerers returned to Lagny, loaded with booty and taking with\r\nthem their prisoners, among whom was Messire Franquet d'Arras. Of\r\nnoble birth and the lord of a manor, he was entitled to expect that he\r\nwould be held to ransom, according to custom. Both Jean de Troissy,\r\nBailie of Senlis,[1954] and the Maid demanded him from the soldier who\r\nwas his captor. It was to the Maid that he was finally delivered.[1955]\r\nDid she obtain him in return for money? Probably, for soldiers were\r\nnot accustomed to give up noble and profitable prisoners for nothing.\r\nNevertheless, the Maid, when questioned on this subject, replied, that\r\nbeing neither mistress nor steward of France, it was not for her to\r\ngive out money. We must suppose, therefore, that some one paid for\r\nher. However that may be, Captain Franquet d'Arras was given up to\r\nher, and she endeavoured to exchange him for a prisoner in the hands\r\nof the English. The man whom she thus desired to deliver was a\r\nParisian who was called Le Seigneur de l'Ours.[1956]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1954: H. Jadart, _Jeanne d'Arc a Reims_, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1955: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1956: _Ibid._, pp. 158, 159.]\r\n\r\nHe was not of gentle birth and his arms were the sign of his hostelry.\r\nIt was the custom in those days to give the title of Seigneur to the\r\nmasters of the great Paris inns. Thus Colin, who kept the inn at the\r\nTemple Gate, was known as Seigneur du Boisseau. The hotel de l'Ours\r\nstood in the Rue Saint-Antoine, near the Gate properly called La Porte\r\nBaudoyer, but commonly known as Porte Baudet, Baudet possessing the\r\ndouble advantage over Baudoyer of being shorter and more\r\ncomprehensible.[1957] It was an ancient and famous inn, equal in renown\r\nto the most famous, to the inn of L'Arbre Sec, in the street of that\r\nname, to the Fleur de Lis near the Pont Neuf, to the Epee in the Rue\r\nSaint-Denis, and to the Chapeau Fetu of the Rue Croix-du-Tirouer. As\r\nearly as King Charles V's reign the inn was much frequented. Before\r\nhuge fires the spits were turning all day long, and there were hot\r\nbread, fresh herrings, and wine of Auxerre in plenty. But since then\r\nthe plunderings of men-at-arms had laid waste the countryside, and\r\ntravellers no longer ventured forth for fear of being robbed and\r\nslain. Knights and pilgrims had ceased coming into the town. Only\r\nwolves came by night and devoured little children in the streets.\r\nThere were no fagots in the grate, no dough in the kneading-trough.\r\nArmagnacs and Burgundians had drunk all the wine, laid waste all the\r\nvineyards, and nought was left in the cellar save a poor piquette of\r\napples and of plums.[1958]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1957: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 71, 72.

Francisque-Michel and\r\nEdouard Fournier, _Histoire des hotelleries, cabarets, hotels garnis_,\r\nParis, 1851 (2 vols. in 8vo), vol. ii, p. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe Seigneur de l'Ours, whom the Maid demanded, was called Jaquet\r\nGuillaume.[1959] Although Jeanne, like other folk, called him Seigneur,\r\nit is not certain that he personally directed his inn, nor even that\r\nthe inn was open through these years of disaster and desolation. The\r\nonly ascertainable fact is that he was the proprietor of the house\r\nwith the sign of the Bear (_l'Ours_). He held it by right of his wife\r\nJeannette, and had come into possession of it in the following manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1959: A. Longnon, _Paris pendant la domination anglaise_, p.\r\n117.]\r\n\r\nFourteen years before, when King Henry with his knighthood had not yet\r\nlanded in France, the host of the Bear Inn had been the King's\r\nsergeant-at-arms, one Jean Roche, a man of wealth and fair fame. He\r\nwas a devoted follower of the Duke of Burgundy, and that was what\r\nruined him. Paris was then occupied by the Armagnacs. In the year\r\n1416, in order to turn them out of the city, Jean Roche concerted with\r\ndivers burgesses. The plot was to be carried out on Easter Day, which\r\nthat year fell on the 29th of April. But the Armagnacs discovered it.\r\nThey threw the conspirators into prison and brought them to trial. On\r\nthe first Saturday in May the Seigneur de l'Ours was carried to the\r\nmarket place in a tumbrel with Durand de Brie, a dyer, master of the\r\nsixty cross-bowmen of Paris, and Jean Perquin, pin-maker and brasier.\r\nAll three were beheaded, and the body of the Seigneur de l'Ours was\r\nhanged at Montfaucon where it remained until the entrance of the\r\nBurgundians. Six weeks after their coming, in July, 1418, his body was\r\ntaken down from gibbet and buried in consecrated ground.[1960]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1960: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 71, 72. A.\r\nLongnon, _Paris pendant la domination anglaise_, p. 118, note 1.]\r\n\r\nNow the widow of Jean Roche had a daughter by a first marriage. Her\r\nname was Jeannette; she took for her first husband a certain Bernard\r\nle Breton; for her second, Jaquet Guillaume, who was not rich. He owed\r\nmoney to Maitre Jean Fleury, a clerk at law and the King's secretary.\r\nHis wife's affairs were not more prosperous; her father's goods had\r\nbeen confiscated and she had been obliged to redeem a part of her\r\nmaternal inheritance. In 1424, the couple were short of money, and\r\nthey sold a house, concealing the fact that it was mortgaged. Being\r\ncharged by the purchaser, they were thrown into prison, where they\r\naggravated their offence by suborning two witnesses, one a priest, the\r\nother a chambermaid. Fortunately for them, they procured a\r\npardon.[1961]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1961: A. Longnon, _Paris pendant la domination anglaise_, pp.\r\n119-123.]\r\n\r\nThe Jaquet Guillaume couple, therefore, were in a sorry plight. There\r\nremained to them, however, the inheritance of Jean Roche, the inn near\r\nthe Place Baudet, at the sign of the Bear, the title of which Jaquet\r\nGuillaume bore. This second Seigneur de l'Ours was to be as strongly\r\nArmagnac as the other had been Burgundian, and was to pay the same\r\nprice for his opinions.\r\n\r\nSix years had passed since his release from prison, when, in the March\r\nof 1430, there was plotted by the Carmelites of Melun and certain\r\nburgesses of Paris that conspiracy which we mentioned on the occasion\r\nof Jeanne's departure for l'Ile de France. It was not the first plot\r\ninto which the Carmelites had entered; they had plotted that rising\r\nwhich had been on the point of breaking out on the Day of the\r\nNativity, when the Maid was leading the attack near La Porte\r\nSaint-Honore; but never before had so many burgesses and so many\r\nnotables entered into a conspiracy. A clerk of the Treasury, Maitre\r\nJean de la Chapelle, two magistrates of the Chatelet, Maitre Renaud\r\nSavin and Maitre Pierre Morant, a very wealthy man, named Jean de\r\nCalais, burgesses, merchants, artisans, more than one hundred and\r\nfifty persons, held the threads of this vast web, and among them,\r\nJaquet Guillaume, Seigneur de l'Ours.\r\n\r\nThe Carmelites of Melun directed the whole. Clad as artisans, they\r\nwent from King to burgesses, from burgesses to King; they kept up the\r\ncommunications between those within and those without, and regulated\r\nall the details of the enterprise. One of them asked the conspirators\r\nfor a written undertaking to bring the King's men into the city. Such\r\na demand looks as if the majority of the conspirators were in the pay\r\nof the Royal Council.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for this undertaking these monks brought acts of oblivion\r\nsigned by the King. For the people of Paris to be induced to receive\r\nthe Prince, whom they still called Dauphin, they must needs be assured\r\nof a full and complete amnesty. For more than ten years, while the\r\nEnglish and Burgundians had been holding the town, no one had felt\r\naltogether free from the reproach of their lawful sovereign and the\r\nmen of his party. And all the more desirous were they for Charles of\r\nValois to forget the past when they recalled the cruel vengeance taken\r\nby the Armagnacs after the suppression of the Butchers.\r\n\r\nOne of the conspirators, Jaquet Perdriel, advocated the sounding of a\r\ntrumpet and the reading of the acts of oblivion on Sunday at the Porte\r\nBaudet.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt,\" he said, \"but that we shall be joined by the\r\ncraftsmen, who, in great numbers will flock to hear the reading.\"\r\n\r\nHe intended leading them to the Saint Antoine Gate and opening it to\r\nthe King's men who were lying in ambush close by.\r\n\r\nSome eighty or a hundred Scotchmen, dressed as Englishmen, wearing the\r\nSaint Andrew's cross, were then to enter the town, bringing in fish\r\nand cattle.\r\n\r\n\"They will enter boldly by the Saint-Denys Gate,\" said Perdriel, \"and\r\ntake possession of it. Whereupon the King's men will enter in force by\r\nthe Porte Saint Antoine.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan was deemed good, except that it was considered better for the\r\nKing's men to come in by the Saint-Denys Gate.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 12th of March, the second Sunday in Lent, Maitre Jean\r\nde la Chapelle invited the magistrate Renaud Savin to come to the\r\ntavern of _La Pomme de Pin_ and meet divers other conspirators in\r\norder to arrive at an understanding touching what was best to be done.\r\nThey decided that on a certain day, under pretext of going to see his\r\nvines at Chapelle-Saint-Denys, Jean de Calais should join the King's\r\nmen outside the walls, make himself known to them by unfurling a white\r\nstandard and bring them into the town. It was further determined that\r\nMaitre Morant and a goodly company of citizens with him, should hold\r\nthemselves in readiness in the taverns of the Rue Saint-Denys to\r\nsupport the French when they came in. In one of the taverns of this\r\nstreet must have been the Seigneur de l'Ours, who, dwelling near by,\r\nhad undertaken to bring together divers folk of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators were acting in perfect agreement. All they now\r\nawaited was to be informed of the day chosen by the Royal Council; and\r\nthey believed the attempt was to be made on the following Sunday. But\r\non the 21st of March Brother Pierre d'Allee, Prior of the Carmelites\r\nof Melun, was taken by the English. Put to the torture, he confessed\r\nthe plot and named his accomplices. On the information he gave, more\r\nthan one hundred and fifty persons were arrested and tried. On the 8th\r\nof April, the Eve of Palm Sunday, seven of the most important were\r\ntaken to the market-place on a tumbrel. They were: Jean de la\r\nChapelle, clerk of the Treasury; Renaud Savin and Pierre Morant,\r\nmagistrates at the Chatelet; Guillaume Perdriau; Jean le Francois,\r\ncalled Baudrin; Jean le Rigueur, baker, and Jaquet Guillaume, Seigneur\r\nde l'Ours. All seven were beheaded by the executioner, who afterwards\r\nquartered the bodies of Jean de la Chapelle and of Baudrin.\r\n\r\nJaquet Perdriel was merely deprived of his possessions. Jean de Calais\r\nsoon procured a pardon. Jeannette, the wife of Jaquet Guillaume, was\r\nbanished from the kingdom and her goods confiscated.[1962]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1962: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 251, 253.\r\nFalconbridge, in A. Longnon, _Paris pendant la domination anglaise_,\r\np. 302, note 1.

Possibly the\r\nCarmelites of Melun had recommended him to her, and perhaps it was on\r\ntheir advice that she demanded his surrender. She may have seen him in\r\nthe September of 1429, at Saint-Denys or before the walls of Paris,\r\nand he may have then undertaken to work for the Dauphin and his party.\r\nWhy were attempts made at Lagny to save this man alone of the one\r\nhundred and fifty Parisians arrested on the information of Brother\r\nPierre d'Allee? Rather than Renaud Savin and Pierre Morant,\r\nmagistrates at the Chatelet, rather than Jean de la Chapelle, clerk of\r\nthe Treasury, why choose the meanest of the band? And how could they\r\nlook to exchange a man accused of treachery for a prisoner of war? All\r\nthis seems to us mysterious and inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of May, Jeanne did not know what had become of\r\nJaquet Guillaume. When she heard that he had been tried and put to\r\ndeath she was sore grieved and vexed. None the less, she looked upon\r\nFranquet as a captive held to ransom. But the Bailie of Senlis, who\r\nfor some unknown reason was determined on the captain's ruin, took\r\nadvantage of the Maid's vexation at Jaquet Guillaume's execution, and\r\npersuaded her to give up her prisoner.\r\n\r\nHe represented to her that this man had committed many a murder, many\r\na theft, that he was a traitor, and that consequently he ought to be\r\nbrought to trial.\r\n\r\n\"You will be neglecting to execute justice,\" he said, \"if you set this\r\nFranquet free.\"\r\n\r\nThese reasons decided her, or rather she yielded to the Bailie's\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n\"Since the man I wished to have is dead,\" she said, \"do with Franquet\r\nas justice shall require you.\"[1963]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1963: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 158, 159.]\r\n\r\nThus she surrendered her prisoner. Was she right or wrong? Before\r\ndeciding we must ask whether it were possible for her to do otherwise\r\nthan she did. She was the Maid of God, the angel of the Lord of Hosts,\r\nthat is clear. But the leaders of war, the captains, paid no great\r\nheed to what she said. As for the Bailie, he was the King's man, of\r\nnoble birth and passing powerful.\r\n\r\nAssisted by the judges of Lagny, he himself conducted the trial. The\r\naccused confessed that he was a murderer, a thief, and a traitor. We\r\nmust believe him; and yet we cannot forbear a doubt as to whether he\r\nreally was, any more than the majority of Armagnac or Burgundian\r\nmen-at-arms, any more than a Damoiseau de Commercy or a Guillaume de\r\nFlavy, for example. He was condemned to death.\r\n\r\nJeanne consented that he should die, if he had deserved death, and\r\nseeing that he had confessed his crimes[1964] he was beheaded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1964: _Ibid._, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nWhen they heard of the scandalous treatment of Messire Franquet, the\r\nBurgundians were loud in their sorrow and indignation.[1965] It would\r\nseem that in this matter the Bailie of Senlis and the judges of Lagny\r\ndid not act according to custom. We, however, are not sufficiently\r\nacquainted with the circumstances to form an opinion. There may have\r\nbeen some reason, of which we are ignorant, why the King of France\r\nshould have demanded this prisoner. He had a right to do so on\r\ncondition that he paid the Maid the amount of the ransom. A soldier of\r\nthose days, well informed in all things touching honour in war, was\r\nthe author of _Le Jouvencel_. In his chivalrous romances he writes\r\napprovingly of the wise Amydas, King of Amydoine, who, learning that\r\none of his enemies, the Sire de Morcellet, has been taken in battle\r\nand held to ransom, cries out that he is the vilest of traitors,\r\nransoms him with good coins of the realm, and hands him over to the\r\nprovost of the town and the officers of his council that they may\r\nexecute justice upon him.[1966] Such was the royal prerogative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1965: _Ibid._, p. 254. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 385. E.\r\nRicher, _Histoire manuscrite de la Pucelle_, book i, folio 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1966: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, pp. 210, 211.]\r\n\r\nWhether it was that camp life was hardening her, or whether, like all\r\nmystics, she was subject to violent changes of mood, Jeanne showed at\r\nLagny none of that gentleness she had displayed on the evening of\r\nPatay. The virgin who once had no other arm in battle than her\r\nstandard, now wielded a sword found there, at Lagny, a Burgundian\r\nsword and a trusty. Those who regarded her as an angel of the Lord,\r\ngood Brother Pasquerel, for example, might justify her by saying that\r\nthe Archangel Saint Michael, the standard-bearer of celestial hosts,\r\nbore a flaming sword. And indeed Jeanne remained a saint.\r\n\r\nWhile she was at Lagny, folk came and told her that a child had died\r\nat birth, unbaptized.[1967] Having entered into the mother at the time\r\nof her conception, the devil held the soul of this child, who, for\r\nlack of water, had died the enemy of its Creator. The greatest anxiety\r\nwas felt concerning the fate of this soul. Some thought it was in\r\nlimbo, banished forever from God's sight, but the more general and\r\nbetter founded opinion was that it was seething in hell; for has not\r\nSaint Augustine demonstrated that souls, little as well as great, are\r\ndamned because of original sin. And how could it be otherwise, seeing\r\nthat Eve's fall had effaced the divine likeness in this child? He was\r\ndestined to eternal death. And to think that with a few drops of water\r\nthis death might have been avoided! So terrible a disaster afflicted\r\nnot only the poor creature's kinsfolk, but likewise the neighbours and\r\nall good Christians in the town of Lagny. The body was carried to the\r\nChurch of Saint-Pierre and placed before the image of Our Lady, which\r\nhad been highly venerated ever since the plague of 1128. It was called\r\nNotre-Dame-des-Ardents because it cured burns, and when there were no\r\nburns to be cured it was called Notre-Dame-des-Aidants, or rather Des\r\nAidances, that is, Our Lady the Helper, because she granted succour to\r\nthose in dire necessity.[1968]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1967: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1968: A. Denis, _Jeanne d'Arc a Lagny_, Lagny, 1896, in 8vo,\r\npp. 4 _et seq._ J.A. Lepaire, _Jeanne d'Arc a Lagny_, Lagny, 1880, in\r\n8vo, 38 pages.]\r\n\r\nThe maidens of the town knelt before her, the little body in their\r\nmidst, beseeching her to intercede with her divine Son so that this\r\nlittle child might have his share in the Redemption brought by our\r\nSaviour.[1969] In such cases the Holy Virgin did not always deny her\r\npowerful intervention. Here it may not be inappropriate to relate a\r\nmiracle she had worked thirty-seven years before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1969: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nAt Paris, in 1393, a sinful creature, finding herself with child,\r\nconcealed her pregnancy, and, when her time was come, was without aid\r\ndelivered. Then, having stuffed linen into the throat of the girl she\r\nhad brought forth, she went and threw her on to the dust-heap outside\r\nLa Porte Saint-Martin-des-Champs. But a dog scented the body, and\r\nscratching away the other refuse, discovered it. A devout woman, who\r\nhappened to be passing by, took this poor little lifeless creature,\r\nand, followed by more than four hundred people, bore it to the Church\r\nof Saint-Martin-des-Champs, there placed it on the altar of Our Lady,\r\nand kneeling down with the multitude of folk and the monks of the\r\nAbbey, with all her heart prayed the Holy Virgin not to suffer this\r\ninnocent babe to be condemned eternally. The child stirred a little,\r\nopened her eyes, loosened the linen, which gagged her, and cried\r\naloud. A priest baptized her on the altar of Our Lady, and gave her\r\nthe name of Marie. A nurse was found, and she was fed from the breast.\r\nShe lived three hours, then died and was carried to consecrated\r\nground.[1970]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1970: _Religieux de Saint-Denis_, vol. ii, p. 82. Jean\r\nJuvenal des Ursins, in _Coll. Michaud et Poujoulat_, p. 395, col. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn those days resurrections of unbaptized children were frequent. That\r\nsaintly Abbess, Colette of Corbie, who, when Jeanne was at Lagny,\r\ndwelt at Moulins with the reformed Sisters of Saint Clare, had brought\r\nback to life two of these poor creatures: a girl, who received the\r\nname of Colette at the font and afterwards became nun, then abbess at\r\nPont-a-Mousson; a boy, who was said to have been two days buried and\r\nwhom the servant of the poor declared to be one of the elect. He died\r\nat six months, thus fulfilling the prophecy made by the saint.[1971]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1971: _Acta Sanctorum_, 6th of March, pp. 381 and 617. Abbe\r\nBizouard, _Histoire de Sainte Colette_, pp. 35, 37. Abbe Douillet,\r\n_Sainte Colette, sa vie, ses oeuvres_, 1884, pp. 150-154.]\r\n\r\nWith this kind of miracle Jeanne was doubtless acquainted. About\r\ntwenty-five miles from Domremy, in the duchy of Lorraine, near\r\nLuneville, was the sanctuary of Notre-Dame-des-Aviots, of which she\r\nhad probably heard. Notre-Dame-des-Aviots, or Our Lady of those\r\nbrought back to life, was famed for restoring life to unbaptized\r\nchildren. By means of her intervention they lived again long enough to\r\nbe made Christians.[1972]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1972: Le Cure de Saint-Sulpice, _Notre-Dame de France_,\r\nParis, in 8vo, vol. vi, 1860, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nIn the duchy of Luxembourg, near Montmedy, on the hill of Avioth,[1973]\r\nmultitudes of pilgrims worshipped an image of Our Lady brought there\r\nby angels. On this hill a church had been built for her, with slim\r\npillars and elaborate stonework in trefoils, roses and light foliage.\r\nThis statue worked all manner of miracles. At its feet were placed\r\nchildren born dead; they were restored to life and straightway\r\nbaptized.[1974]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1973: For the etymology of Avioth see C. Bonnabelle, _Petite\r\netude sur Avioth et son eglise_, in _Annuaire de la Meuse_, 1883, in\r\n18mo, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1974: Le Cure de Saint-Sulpice, _loc. cit._, vol. v, pp. 107\r\n_et seq._ Bonnabelle, _loc. cit._, pp. 13 _et seq._ Jacquemain,\r\n_Notre-Dame d'Avioth et son eglise monumentale_, Sedan, 1876, in 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe folk, gathered in the Church of Saint-Pierre de Lagny, around the\r\nstatue of Notre-Dame-des-Aidances, hoped for a like grace. The damsels\r\nof the town prayed round the child's lifeless body. The Maid was asked\r\nto come and join them in praying to Our Lord and Our Lady. She went to\r\nthe church, and knelt down with the maidens and prayed. The child was\r\nblack, \"as black as my coat,\" said Jeanne. When the Maid and the\r\ndamsels had prayed, it yawned three times and its colour came back. It\r\nwas baptized and straightway it died; it was buried in consecrated\r\nground. Throughout the town this resurrection was said to be the work\r\nof the Maid. According to the tales in circulation, during the three\r\ndays since its birth the child had given no sign of life;[1975] but the\r\ngossips of Lagny had doubtless extended the period of its comatose\r\ncondition, like those good wives who of a single egg laid by the\r\nhusband of one of them, made a hundred before the day was out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1975: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 105, 106.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOISSONS AND COMPIEGNE--CAPTURE OF THE MAID\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Lagny, the Maid presented herself before Senlis, with her own\r\ncompany and with the fighting men of the French nobles whom she had\r\njoined, in all some thousand horse. And for this force she demanded\r\nentrance into the town. No misfortune was more feared by burgesses\r\nthan that of receiving men-at-arms, and no privilege more jealously\r\nguarded than that of keeping them outside the walls. King Charles had\r\nexperienced it during the peaceful coronation campaign. The folk of\r\nSenlis made answer to the Maid that, seeing the poverty of the town in\r\nforage, corn, oats, victuals and wine, they offered her an entrance\r\nwith thirty or forty of the most notable of her company and no\r\nmore.[1976]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1976: Arch. mun. of Senlis in _Muse des archives\r\ndepartementales_, pp. 304, 305.

Morosini, vol. iii, p. 294, note 5.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that from Senlis Jeanne went to the Castle of Borenglise in\r\nthe parish of Elincourt, between Compiegne and Ressons; and, in\r\nignorance as to what can have taken her there, it is supposed that she\r\nmade a pilgrimage to the Church of Elincourt, which was dedicated to\r\nSaint Margaret; and it is possible that she wished to worship Saint\r\nMargaret there as she had worshipped Saint Catherine at Fierbois, in\r\norder to do honour to one of those heavenly ladies who visited her\r\nevery day and every hour.[1977]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1977: Manuscript History of Beauvais by Hermant, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, p. 165.

Ch. vii, pp. 113, 123.]\r\n\r\nIn those days, in the town of Angers, was a licentiate of laws, canon\r\nof the churches of Tours and Angers and Dean of Saint-Jean d'Angers.\r\nLess than ten days before Jeanne's coming to Sainte-Marguerite\r\nd'Elincourt, on April 18, about nine o'clock in the evening, he felt a\r\npain in the head, which lasted until four o'clock in the morning, and\r\nwas so severe that he thought he must die. He prayed to Saint\r\nCatherine, for whom he professed a special devotion, and straightway\r\nwas cured. In thankfulness for so great a grace, he wended on foot to\r\nthe sanctuary of Saint Catherine of Fierbois; and there, on Friday,\r\nthe 5th of May, in a loud voice, said a mass for the King, for \"the\r\nMaid divinely worthy,\" and for the peace and prosperity of the\r\nrealm.[1978]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1978: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 164, 165. _Les miracles de Madame\r\nSainte Katerine de Fierboys_, pp. 16, 62, 63.]\r\n\r\nThe Council of King Charles had made over Pont-Sainte-Maxence to the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, in lieu of Compiegne, which they were unable to\r\ndeliver to him since that town absolutely refused to be delivered, and\r\nremained the King's despite the King. The Duke of Burgundy kept\r\nPont-Sainte-Maxence which had been granted him and resolved to take\r\nCompiegne.[1979]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1979: P. Champion, _Guillaume de Flavy_.

Note\r\nconcerning G. de Flavy, in _Trial_, vol. v, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of April, when the truce had expired, he took the field\r\nwith a goodly knighthood and a powerful army, four thousand\r\nBurgundians, Picards and Flemings, and fifteen hundred English,\r\ncommanded by Jean de Luxembourg, Count of Ligny.[1980]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1980: Monstrelet, ch. xxx.

Mortars, which the Duke had\r\nbrought and paid ready money for to Messire Jean de Luxembourg, were\r\nbrought likewise; Beaurevoir and Bourgogne, also a great \"_coullard_\"\r\nand a movable engine of war. The vast states of Burgundy sent their\r\narchers and cross-bowmen to Compiegne. The Duke provided himself with\r\nbows from Prussia and from Caffa in Georgia,[1981] and with arrows\r\nbarbed and unbarbed. He engaged sappers and miners to lay powder mines\r\nround the town and to throw Greek fire into it. In short my Lord\r\nPhilip, richer than a king, the most magnificent lord in Christendom\r\nand skilled in all the arts of knighthood, was resolved to make a\r\ngallant siege.[1982]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1981: \"In this country the Emperor [of Constantinople] has a\r\ncity called Capha, which is a seaport belonging to the Genoese and\r\nwhence is obtained wood for the making of bows and cross-bows,\r\nlikewise wine called Rommenie.\" _Le Livre de description des pays de\r\nGilles le Bouvier._ Ed.

Scion of a noble house of that\r\nprovince, forever in dispute with the nobles his neighbours, and\r\nperpetually picking quarrels with the poor folk, he was as wicked and\r\ncruel as any Armagnac baron.[1984] The citizens would have no other\r\ncaptain, and in that office they maintained him in defiance of King\r\nCharles and his chamberlains. They did wisely, for none was better\r\nable to defend the town than my Lord Guillaume, none was more set on\r\ndoing his duty. When the King of France had commanded him to deliver\r\nthe place he had refused point-blank; and when later the Duke promised\r\nhim a good round sum and a rich inheritance in exchange for Compiegne,\r\nhe made answer that the town was not his, but the King's.[1985]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1983: Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol. ii, p. 178.

Jeanne knew him well; he reminded her of a\r\npainful incident. He had been one of those, who finding her wounded in\r\nthe trenches before Paris, had insisted on putting her on her horse\r\nagainst her will. On the approach of King Charles's barons and\r\nmen-at-arms, Captain Guichard made the folk of Soissons believe that\r\nthe whole army was coming to encamp in their town. Wherefore they\r\nresolved not to receive them. Then happened what had already befallen\r\nat Senlis: Captain Bournel received the Lord Archbishop of Reims, the\r\nCount of Vendome and the Maid, with a small company, and the rest of\r\nthe army abode that night outside the walls.[1993] On the morrow,\r\nfailing to obtain command of the bridge, they endeavoured to ford the\r\nriver, but without success; for it was spring and the waters were\r\nhigh. The army had to turn back. When it was gone, Captain Bournel\r\nsold to the Duke of Burgundy the city he was charged to hold for the\r\nKing of France; and he delivered it into the hand of Messire Jean de\r\nLuxembourg for four thousand golden _saluts_.[1994]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1992: Berry, in _Trial_, vol. iv, pp. 49, 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1993: F.

As the penalty of certain crimes it was the custom for\r\nthe executioner, after he had beheaded the condemned, to cut his body\r\nin four pieces, which was called quartering. So that it was as if\r\nJeanne had said that the traitor deserved quartering. The words\r\nsounded hard to Burgundian ears; certain even believed that they heard\r\nJeanne in her wrath taking God's name in vain. They did not hear\r\ncorrectly. Never had Jeanne taken the name of God or of any of his\r\nsaints in vain. Far from swearing when she was angered, she used to\r\nexclaim: \"God's good will!\" or \"Saint John!\" or \"By Our Lady!\"[1995]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1995: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 273.]\r\n\r\nBefore Soissons, Jeanne and the generals separated. The latter with\r\ntheir men-at-arms went to Senlis and the banks of the Marne. The\r\ncountry between the Aisne and the Oise was no longer capable of\r\nsupporting so large a number of men or such important personages.\r\nJeanne and her company wended their way back to Compiegne.[1996]\r\nScarcely had she entered the town when she sallied forth to ravage the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1996: I have rejected the story told by Alain Bouchard of\r\nJeanne's meeting with the little children in the Church of Saint\r\nJacques.

In the middle of May, the French numbering about a\r\nthousand, commanded by Captain Poton, by Messire Jacques de Chabannes\r\nand divers others, and accompanied by the Maid, attacked the English\r\nunder Lord Montgomery, and the battle was passing fierce. But the\r\nenemy, being relieved by the Burgundians of Noyon, the French must\r\nneeds beat a retreat. They had slain thirty of their adversaries and\r\nhad lost as many, wherefore the combat was held to have been right\r\nsanguinary.[1997] There was no longer any question of crossing the\r\nAisne and saving Choisy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1997: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 382. Lefevre de Saint-Remy,\r\nvol. ii, p. 178. _Chronique des cordeliers_, fol. 498 verso.]\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Compiegne, Jeanne, who never rested for a moment,\r\nhastened to Crepy-en-Valois, where were gathering the troops intended\r\nfor the defence of Compiegne. Then, with these troops, she marched\r\nthrough the Forest of Guise, to the besieged town and entered it on\r\nthe 23rd, at daybreak, without having encountered any Burgundians.\r\nThere were none in the neighbourhood of the Forest, on the left bank\r\nof the Oise.[1998]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1998: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 114. Perceval de Cagny, p. 174.\r\nExtract from a note concerning G. de Flavy, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n176. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 296, note 1.]\r\n\r\nThey were all on the other side of the river. There meadowland extends\r\nfor some three-quarters of a mile, while beyond rises the slope of\r\nPicardy. Because this meadow was low, damp and frequently flooded, a\r\ncauseway had been built leading from the bridge to the village of\r\nMargny, which rose on the steep slope of the hill. Some two miles up\r\nthe river there towered the belfry of Clairoix, at the junction of the\r\nAronde and the Oise. On the opposite bank rose the belfry of Venette,\r\nabout a mile and a quarter lower down, towards Pont-Sainte-Maxence.[1999]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1999: Manuscript map of Compiegne in 1509, in Debout, _Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, vol. ii, p. 293.

Champion, _Guillaume de Flavy_, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nA little band of Burgundians commanded by a knight, Messire Baudot de\r\nNoyelles, occupied the high ground of the village of Margny. Most\r\nrenowned among the men of war of the Burgundian party was Messire Jean\r\nde Luxembourg. He with his Picards was posted at Clairoix, on the\r\nbanks of the Aronde, at the foot of Mount Ganelon. The five hundred\r\nEnglish of Lord Montgomery watched the Oise at Venette. Duke Philip\r\noccupied Coudun, a good two and a half miles from the town, towards\r\nPicardy.[2000] Such dispositions were in accordance with the precepts\r\nof the most experienced captains. It was their rule that when\r\nbesieging a fortified town a large number of men-at-arms should never\r\nbe concentrated in one spot, in one camp, as they said. In case of a\r\nsudden attack, it was thought that a large company, if it has but one\r\nbase, will be surprised and routed just as easily as a lesser number,\r\nand the disaster will be grievous. Wherefore it is better to divide\r\nthe besiegers into small companies and to place them not far apart, in\r\norder that they may aid one another. In this wise, when those of one\r\nbody are discomfited those of another have time to put themselves in\r\nbattle array for their succour. While the assailants are sore aghast\r\nat seeing fresh troops come down upon them, those who are being\r\nattacked take heart of grace. At any rate such was the opinion of\r\nMessire Jean de Bueil.[2001]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2000: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 383, 384.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2001: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p. 196.]\r\n\r\nThat same day, the 23rd of May, towards five o'clock in the\r\nevening[2002] riding a fine dapple-grey horse, Jeanne sallied forth,\r\nacross the bridge, on to the causeway over the meadow. With her were\r\nher standard-bearer and her company of Lombards, Captain Baretta and\r\nhis three or four hundred men, both horse and foot, who had entered\r\nCompiegne by night. She was girt with the Burgundian sword, found at\r\nLagny, and over her armour she wore a surcoat of cloth of gold.[2003]\r\nSuch attire would have better beseemed a parade than a sortie; but in\r\nthe simplicity of her rustic and religious soul she loved all the\r\npompous show of chivalry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2002: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 116.

The last-named,\r\nin order to protect the line of retreat for the French, had posted\r\narchers, cross-bowmen, and cannoneers at the head of the bridge, while\r\non the river he launched a number of small covered boats, intended if\r\nneed were to bring back as many men as possible.[2004] Jeanne was not\r\nconsulted in the matter; her advice was never asked. Without being\r\ntold anything she was taken with the army as a bringer of good luck;\r\nshe was exhibited to the enemy as a powerful enchantress, and they,\r\nespecially if they were in mortal sin, feared lest she should cast a\r\nspell over them. Certain there were doubtless on both sides, who\r\nperceived that she did not greatly differ from other women;[2005] but\r\nthey were folk who believed in nothing, and that manner of person is\r\nalways outside public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2004: Notes concerning G. de Flavy, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n177. _Chronique de Tournai_, in _Recueil des Chroniques de Flandre_,\r\n1856, vol. iii, pp. 415, 416.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2005: Chastellain, vol. ii, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nThis time she had not the remotest idea of what was to be done. With\r\nher head full of dreams, she imagined she was setting forth for some\r\ngreat and noble emprise. It is said that she had promised to discomfit\r\nthe Burgundians and bring back Duke Philip prisoner. But there was no\r\nquestion of that; Captain Baretta and those who commanded the soldiers\r\nof fortune proposed to surprise and plunder the little Burgundian\r\noutpost, which was nearest the town and most accessible. That was\r\nMargny, and there on a steep hill, which might be reached in twenty or\r\ntwenty-five minutes along the causeway, was stationed Messire Baudot\r\nde Noyelles. The attempt was worth making. The taking of outposts\r\nconstituted the perquisites of men-at-arms. And, albeit the enemy's\r\npositions were very wisely chosen, the assailants if they proceeded\r\nwith extreme swiftness had a chance of success. The Burgundians at\r\nMargny were very few. Having but lately arrived, they had erected\r\nneither bastion nor bulwark, and their only defences were the\r\noutbuildings of the village.\r\n\r\nIt was five o'clock in the afternoon when the French set out on the\r\nmarch. The days being at their longest, they did not depend on the\r\ndarkness for success. In those times indeed, men-at-arms were chary of\r\nventuring much in the darkness. They deemed the night treacherous,\r\ncapable of serving the fool's turn as well as the wise man's, and thus\r\nran the saw: \"Night never blushes at her deed.\"[2006]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2006: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nHaving climbed up to Margny, the assailants found the Burgundians\r\nscattered and unarmed. They took them by surprise; and the French set\r\nto work to strike here and there haphazard. The Maid, for her part,\r\noverthrew everything before her.\r\n\r\nNow just at this time Sire Jean de Luxembourg and the Sire de Crequy\r\nhad ridden over from their camp at Clairoix.[2007] Wearing no armour,\r\nand accompanied by eight or ten gentlemen-at-arms, they were climbing\r\nthe Margny hill. They were on their way to visit Messire Baudot de\r\nNoyelles, and all unsuspecting, they were thinking to reconnoitre the\r\ndefences of the town from this elevated spot, as the Earl of Salisbury\r\nhad formerly done from Les Tourelles at Orleans. Having fallen into a\r\nregular skirmish, they sent to Clairoix in all haste for their arms\r\nand to summon their company, which would take a good half hour to\r\nreach the scene of battle. Meanwhile, all unarmed as they were, they\r\njoined Messire Baudot's little band, to help it to hold out against\r\nthe enemy.[2008] Thus to surprise my Lord of Luxembourg might be a\r\nstroke of good luck and certainly could not be bad; for in any event\r\nthe Margny men would have straightway summoned their comrades of\r\nClairoix to their aid, as they did in very deed summon the English\r\nfrom Venette and the Burgundians from Coudun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2007: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 387.

Notes concerning G. de Flavy, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nHaving stormed the camp and pillaged it, the assailants should in all\r\nhaste have fallen back on the town with their booty; but they dallied\r\nat Margny, for what reason is not difficult to guess: that reason\r\nwhich so often transformed the robber into the robbed. The wearers of\r\nthe white cross as well as those of the red, no matter what danger\r\nthreatened them, never quitted a place as long as anything remained to\r\nbe carried away.\r\n\r\nIf the mercenaries of Compiegne incurred peril by their greed, the\r\nMaid on her side by her valour and prowess ran much greater risk;\r\nnever would she consent to leave a battle; she must be wounded,\r\npierced with bolts and arrows, before she would give in.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, having recovered from so sudden an alarm, Messire Baudot's\r\nmen armed as best they might and endeavoured to win back the village.\r\nNow they drove out the French, now they themselves were forced to\r\nretreat with great loss. The Seigneur de Crequy, among others, was\r\nsorely wounded in the face. But the hope of being reinforced gave them\r\ncourage. The men of Clairoix appeared. Duke Philip himself came up\r\nwith the band from Coudun. The French, outnumbered, abandoned Margny,\r\nand retreated slowly. It may be that their booty impeded their march.\r\nBut suddenly espying the _Godons_ from Venette advancing over the\r\nmeadowland, they were seized with panic; to the cry of \"_Sauve qui\r\npeut!_\" they broke into one mad rush and in utter rout reached the\r\nbank of the Oise. Some threw themselves into boats, others crowded\r\nround the bulwark of the Bridge. Thus they attracted the very\r\nmisfortune they feared. For the English followed so hard on the\r\nfugitives that the defenders on the ramparts dared not fire their\r\ncannon for fear of striking the French.[2009]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2009: Perceval de Cagny, p. 176.

The captain of Compiegne saw the danger and gave the command to\r\nclose the town gate. The bridge was raised and the portcullis\r\nlowered.[2010]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2010: Note concerning G. de Flavy, _loc. cit._ Du Fresne de\r\nBeaucourt, _Jeanne d'Arc et Guillaume de Flavy_ in _Bulletin de la\r\nSociete de l'Histoire de France_, vol. iii, 1861, pp. 173 _et seq._ Z.\r\nRendu, _Jeanne d'Arc et G. de Flavy_, Compiegne, 1865, in 8vo, 32 pp.\r\nA.

Surrounded by a little band of kinsmen and personal\r\nretainers, she was withstanding the Burgundians, and imagining that\r\nshe would overthrow everything before her.\r\n\r\nHer comrades shouted to her: \"Strive to regain the town or we are\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\nBut her eyes were dazzled by the splendour of angels and archangels,\r\nand she made answer: \"Hold your peace; it will be your fault if we are\r\ndiscomfited. Think of nought but of attacking them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd once again she uttered those words which were forever in her\r\nmouth: \"Go forward! They are ours!\"[2011]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2011: Perceval de Cagny, p. 175.]\r\n\r\nHer men took her horse by the bridle and forced her to turn towards\r\nthe town. It was too late; the bulwarks commanding the bridge could\r\nnot be entered: the English held the head of the causeway. The Maid\r\nwith her little band was penned into the corner between the side of\r\nthe bulwark and the embankment of the road. Her assailants were men of\r\nPicardy, who, striking hard and driving away her protectors, succeeded\r\nin reaching her.[2012] A bowman pulled her by her cloak of cloth of\r\ngold and threw her to the ground. They all surrounded her and together\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\"Surrender!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2012: Perceval de Cagny, p. 175.

Deeming that his fortune was made, he appeared more joyful\r\nthan if he had taken a king.[2014]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2014: Letter from the Duke of Burgundy in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n166.

Duke Philip wished to see her. When he\r\ndrew near to her, there were certain of his clergy and his knighthood\r\nwho praised his piety, extolled his courage, and wondered that this\r\nmighty Duke was not afraid of the spawn of Hell.[2020]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2019: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 388.

Among them\r\nwas Messire Enguerrand de Monstrelet, a native of the County of\r\nBoulogne, a retainer of the House of Luxembourg, the author of the\r\nChronicles. He heard the words the Duke addressed to the prisoner,\r\nand, albeit his calling required a good memory, he forgot them.\r\nPossibly he did not consider them chivalrous enough to be written in\r\nhis book.[2021]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2021: Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 388.]\r\n\r\nJeanne remained in the custody of Messire Jean de Luxembourg, to whom\r\nshe belonged henceforward. The bowman, her captor, had given her up to\r\nhis captain, the Bastard of Wandomme, who, in his turn, had yielded\r\nher to his Master, Messire Jean.[2022]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2022: _Ibid._, p. 389. P. Champion, _loc. cit._, p. 168.]\r\n\r\nBranches of the Luxembourg tree extended from the west to the east of\r\nChristendom, as far as Bohemia and Hungary; and it had produced six\r\nqueens, an empress, four kings, and four emperors. A scion of a\r\nyounger branch of this illustrious house and himself a but poorly\r\nlanded cadet, Jean de Luxembourg, had with great labour won his spurs\r\nin the service of the Duke of Burgundy. When he held the Maid to\r\nransom, he was thirty-nine years of age, covered with wounds and\r\none-eyed.[2023]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2023: _La Chronique des cordeliers_, and Monstrelet,\r\n_passim_.

We beseech you in all good affection, O powerful Prince,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and we entreat your noble vassals that by them and by you\r\nJeanne be sent unto us surely and shortly, and we hope that thus ye\r\nwill do as being the true protector of the faith and the defender of\r\nGod's honour....\"[2029]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2029: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 12.

In the days of Innocent III, when the Inquisition was\r\nexterminating Cathari and Albigenses, the sons of Dominic figured in\r\npaintings in monasteries and chapels as great white hounds spotted\r\nwith black, biting at the throats of the wolves of heresy.[2031] In\r\nFrance in the fifteenth century the Dominicans were always the dogs of\r\nthe Lord; they, jointly with the bishops, drove out the heretic. The\r\nGrand Inquisitor or his Vicar was unable of his own initiative to set\r\non foot and prosecute any judicial action; the bishops maintained\r\ntheir right to judge crimes committed against the Church. In matters\r\nof faith trials were conducted by two judges, the Ordinary, who might\r\nbe the bishop himself or the Official, and the Inquisitor or his\r\nVicar. Inquisitorial forms were observed.[2032]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2030: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 3, 12; vol. iii, p. 378; vol. v,\r\np. 392.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2031: _Domini canes._ Thus they are represented in the\r\nfrescoes of the Capella degli Spagnuoli in Santa-Maria-Novella at\r\nFlorence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2032: Tanon, _Histoire des tribuneaux de l'inquisition en\r\nFrance_, ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nIn the Maid's case it was not the Bishop only who was prompting the\r\nHoly Inquisition, but the Daughter of Kings, the Mother of Learning,\r\nthe Bright and Shining Sun of France and of Christendom, the\r\nUniversity of Paris. She arrogated to herself a peculiar jurisdiction\r\nin cases of heresy or other matters of doctrine occurring in the city\r\nor its neighbourhood; her advice was asked on every hand and regarded\r\nas authoritative over the face of the whole world, wheresoever the\r\nCross had been set up. For a year her masters and doctors, many in\r\nnumber and filled with sound learning, had been clamouring for the\r\nMaid to be delivered up to the Inquisition, as being good for the\r\nwelfare of the Church and conducive to the interests of the faith; for\r\nthey had a deep-rooted suspicion that the damsel came not from God,\r\nbut was deceived and seduced by the machinations of the Devil; that\r\nshe acted not by divine power but by the aid of demons; that she was\r\naddicted to witchcraft and practised idolatry.[2033]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2033: Le P. Denifle and Chatelain, _Chartularium\r\nuniversitatis Parisiensis_, vol. iv, p. 510; _Le proces de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc et l'universite de Paris_, Paris, 1897, in 8vo, 32 pp.]\r\n\r\nSuch knowledge as they possessed of things divine and methods of\r\nreasoning corroborated this grave suspicion. They were Burgundians and\r\nEnglish by necessity and by inclination; they observed faithfully the\r\nTreaty of Troyes to which they had sworn; they were devoted to the\r\nRegent who showed them great consideration; they abhorred the\r\nArmagnacs, who desolated and laid waste their city, the most beautiful\r\nin the world;[2034] they held that the Dauphin Charles had forfeited\r\nhis rights to the Kingdom of the Lilies. Wherefore they inclined to\r\nbelieve that the Maid of the Armagnacs, the woman knight of the\r\nDauphin Charles, was inspired by a company of loathsome demons. These\r\nscholars of the University were human; they believed what it was to\r\ntheir interest to believe; they were priests and they beheld the Devil\r\neverywhere, but especially in a woman. Without having devoted\r\nthemselves to any profound examination of the deeds and sayings of\r\nthis damsel, they knew enough to cause them to demand an immediate\r\ninquiry. She called herself the emissary of God, the daughter of God;\r\nand she appeared loquacious, vain, crafty, gorgeous in her attire. She\r\nhad threatened the English that if they did not quit France she would\r\nhave them all slain. She commanded armies, wherefore she was a slayer\r\nof her fellow-creatures and foolhardy. She was seditious, for are not\r\nall those seditious who support the opposite party? But recently\r\nhaving appeared before Paris in company with Friar Richard, a heretic,\r\nand a rebel,[2035] she had threatened to put the Parisians to death\r\nwithout mercy and committed the mortal sin of storming the city on the\r\nAnniversary of the Nativity of Our Lady. It was important to examine\r\nwhether in all this she had been inspired by a good spirit or a\r\nbad.[2036]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2034: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, _passim_.\r\nFalconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 450.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2035: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 237.

Her\r\nsteward, Messire Jean d'Aulon, waited on her in her prison; one day he\r\nsaid to her pitifully:\r\n\r\n\"That poor town of Compiegne, which you so dearly loved, will now be\r\ndelivered into the hands of the enemies of France, whom it must needs\r\nobey.\"\r\n\r\nShe made answer: \"No, that shall not come to pass. For not one of\r\nthose places, which the King of Heaven hath conquered through me and\r\nrestored to their allegiance to the fair King Charles, shall be\r\nrecaptured by the enemy, so diligently will he guard them.\"[2038]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2038: Perceval de Cagny, p. 177, very doubtful.]\r\n\r\nOne day she tried to escape by slipping between two planks. She had\r\nintended to shut up her guards in the tower and take to the fields,\r\nbut the porter saw and stopped her. She concluded that it was not\r\nGod's will that she should escape this time.[2039] Notwithstanding she\r\nhad far too much self-reliance to despair. Her Voices, like her\r\nenamoured of marvellous encounters and knightly adventures, told her\r\nthat she must see the King of England.[2040] Thus did her dreams\r\nencourage and console her in her misfortune.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2039: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 163-164, 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2040: _Ibid._, p. 151.]\r\n\r\nGreat was the mourning on the Loire when the inhabitants of the towns\r\nloyal to King Charles learnt the disaster which had befallen the Maid.\r\nThe people, who venerated her as a saint, who went so far as to say\r\nthat she was the greatest of all God's saints after the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary, who erected images of her in the chapels of saints, who ordered\r\nmasses to be said for her, and collects in the churches, who wore\r\nleaden medals on which she was represented as if the Church had\r\nalready canonized her,[2041] did not withdraw their trust, but\r\ncontinued to believe in her.[2042] Such faithfulness scandalized the\r\ndoctors and masters of the University, who reproached the hapless Maid\r\nherself with it. \"Jeanne,\" they said, \"hath so seduced the Catholic\r\npeople, that many have adored her as a saint in her presence, and now\r\nin her absence they adore her still.\"[2043]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2041: Vallet de Viriville, _Note sur deux medailles de plomb\r\nrelatives a Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris, 1861, in 8vo, 30 pages.

The councillors of\r\nthe town of Tours ordered public prayers to be offered for the\r\ndeliverance of the Maid. There was a public procession in which took\r\npart the canons of the cathedral church, the clergy of the town,\r\nsecular and regular, all walking barefoot.[2044]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2044: Carreau, _Histoire manuscrite de Touraine_, in\r\n_Proces_, vol. v, pp. 253, 254.]\r\n\r\nIn the towns of Dauphine prayers for the Maid were said at mass.\r\n\r\n\"_Collect._ O God, all powerful and eternal, who, in thy holy and\r\nineffable mercy, hast commanded the Maid to restore and deliver the\r\nrealm of France, and to repulse, confound and annihilate her enemies,\r\nand who hast permitted her, in the accomplishment of this holy work,\r\nordained by thee, to fall into the hands and into the bonds of her\r\nenemies, we beseech thee, by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary and of all the saints to deliver her out of their hands, without\r\nher having suffered any hurt, in order that she may finish the work\r\nwhereto thou hast sent her.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of Jesus Christ, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Secret._ O God all powerful, Father of virtues, let thy holy\r\nbenediction descend upon this sacrifice; let thy wondrous power be\r\nmade manifest, that by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and\r\nof all the saints, it may deliver the Maid from the prisons of the\r\nenemy so that she may finish the work whereto thou hast sent her.\r\nThrough our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Post Communion._ O God all powerful, incline thine ear and listen\r\nunto the prayers of thy people: by the virtue of the Sacrament we have\r\njust received, by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of\r\nall the saints, burst the bonds of the Maid, who, in the fulfilment of\r\nthy commands, hath been and is still confined in the prisons of our\r\nenemy; through thy divine compassion and thy mercy, permit her, freed\r\nfrom peril, to accomplish the work whereto thou hast sent her.

Father Marcellin Fornier, _Histoire des Alpes Maritimes ou\r\nCottiennes_, vol. ii, pp. 313 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAddressing the Prince, whom in childhood he had directed, Messire\r\nJacques begins by recalling what the Maid had wrought for him by God's\r\nhelp and her own great courage. He beseeches him to examine his\r\nconscience and see whether he has in any wise sinned against the grace\r\nof God. For it may be that in wrath against the King the Lord hath\r\npermitted this virgin to be taken. For his own honour he urges him to\r\nstrain every effort for her deliverance.\r\n\r\n\"I commend unto you,\" he said, \"that for the recovery of this damsel\r\nand for her ransom, ye spare neither measures nor money, nor any cost,\r\nunless ye be ready to incur the ineffaceable disgrace of an\r\ningratitude right unworthy.\"\r\n\r\nFurther he advises that prayers be ordered to be said everywhere for\r\nthe deliverance of the Maid, so that if this disaster should have\r\nbefallen through any misdoing of the King or of his people, it might\r\nplease God to pardon it.[2047]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2047: _Ibid._, pp. 319, 320.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the words, lacking neither in strength nor in charity, of\r\nthis aged prelate, who was more of a hermit than of a bishop. He\r\nremembered having been the Dauphin's Councillor in evil days and he\r\ndearly loved the King and the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Sire de la Tremouille and the Lord Archbishop of Reims have been\r\nsuspected of desiring to get rid of the Maid and of having promoted\r\nher discomfiture. There are those who think they have discovered the\r\ntreacherous methods employed to compass her defeat at Paris, at La\r\nCharite and at Compiegne.[2048] But in good sooth such methods were\r\nunnecessary. At Paris there was but little chance of her being able to\r\ncross the moat, since neither she nor her companions in arms had\r\nascertained its depth; besides, it was not the fault of the King and\r\nhis Council that the Carmelites, on whom they relied, failed to open\r\nthe gates. The siege of La Charite was conducted not by the Maid, but\r\nby the Sire d'Albret and divers valiant captains. In the sortie from\r\nCompiegne, it was certain that any dallying at Margny would cause the\r\nFrench to be cut off by the English from Venette and by the\r\nBurgundians from Clairoix and to be promptly overcome by the\r\nBurgundians from Coudun. They forgot themselves in the delights of\r\npillage; and the inevitable result followed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2048: Thomassin, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 312. _Chronique du\r\ndoyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 323. _Chronique de\r\nTournai_, in _Recueil des chroniques de Flandre_, vol. iii, p. 415.\r\n_Chronique de Normandie_, ed. A. Hellot, Rouen, 1881, in 8vo, pp. 77,\r\n78. _Chronique de Lorraine_, ed. Abbe Marchal (_Recueil de documents\r\nsur l'histoire de Lorraine_, vol. v).]\r\n\r\nAnd why should the Lord Chamberlain and the Lord Archbishop have\r\nwanted to get rid of the Maid? She did not trouble them; on the\r\ncontrary they found her useful and employed her. By her prophecy that\r\nshe would cause the King to be anointed at Reims, she rendered an\r\nimmense service to my Lord Regnault, who more than any other profited\r\nfrom the Champagne expedition, more even than the King, who, while he\r\nsucceeded in being crowned, failed to recover Paris and Normandy.\r\nNotwithstanding this great advantage, the Lord Archbishop felt no\r\ngratitude towards the Maid; he was a hard man and an egoist. But did\r\nhe wish her harm? Had he not need of her? At Senlis he was maintaining\r\nthe King's cause; and he was maintaining it well, we may be sure,\r\nsince, with the towns that had returned to their liege lord, he was\r\ndefending his own episcopal and ducal city, his benefices and his\r\ncanonries. Did he not intend to use her against the Burgundians? We\r\nhave already noted reasons for believing that towards the end of\r\nMarch, he had asked the Sire de la Tremouille to send her from Sully\r\nwith a goodly company to wage war in l'Ile-de-France. And our\r\nhypothesis is confirmed when, after they had been unhappily deprived\r\nof Jeanne's services, we find the bishop and the Chamberlain driven to\r\nreplace her by someone likewise favoured with visions and claiming to\r\nbe sent of God. Unable to discover a maid they had to make shift with\r\na youth. This resolution they took a few days after Jeanne's capture\r\nand this is how it came about.\r\n\r\nSome time before, a shepherd lad of Gevaudan, by name Guillaume, while\r\ntending his flocks at the foot of the Lozere Mountains and guarding\r\nthem from wolf and lynx, had a revelation concerning the realm of\r\nFrance. This shepherd, like John, Our Lord's favourite disciple, was\r\nvirgin. In one of the caves of the Mende Mountain, where the holy\r\napostle Privat had prayed and fasted, his ear was struck by a heavenly\r\nvoice, and thus he knew that God was sending him to the King of\r\nFrance. He went to Mende, just as Jeanne had gone to Vaucouleurs in\r\norder that he might be taken to the King. There he found pious folk,\r\nwho, touched by his holiness and persuaded that there was power in\r\nhim, provided for his equipment and for his journey, which provisions,\r\nin sooth, amounted to very little. The words he addressed to the King\r\nwere much the same as those uttered by the Maid.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" he said, \"I am commanded to go with your people; and without\r\nfail the English and Burgundians shall be discomfited.\"[2049]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2049: Summary of a letter from Regnault de Chartres to the\r\ninhabitants of Reims, _Trial_, vol. v, p. 168.]\r\n\r\nThe King received him kindly. The clerks who had examined the Maid\r\nmust have feared lest if they repulsed this shepherd lad they might be\r\nrejecting the aid of the Holy Ghost. Amos was a shepherd, and to him\r\nGod granted the gift of prophecy: \"I thank thee, O Father, Lord of\r\nheaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and\r\nprudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\" MATT. xi, 25.\r\n\r\nBut before this shepherd could be believed he must give a sign. The\r\nclerks of Poitiers, who in those evil days languished in dire penury,\r\ndid not appear exacting in their demand for proofs; they had\r\ncounselled the King to employ the Maid merely on the promise that as a\r\ntoken of her mission she would deliver Orleans. The Gevaudan shepherd\r\nhad more than promises to allege; he showed wondrous marks on his\r\nbody. Like Saint Francis he had received the stigmata; and on his\r\nhands, his feet and in his side were bleeding wounds.[2050]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2050: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 272. Lefevre de\r\nSaint-Remy, vol. ii, p. 263. Martial d'Auvergne, _Vigiles_, vol. i, p.\r\n124.]\r\n\r\nThe mendicant monks rejoiced that their spiritual father had thus\r\nparticipated in the Passion of Our Lord. A like grace had been granted\r\nto the Blessed Catherine of Sienna, of the order of Saint Dominic.\r\nBut if there were miraculous stigmata imprinted by Jesus Christ\r\nhimself, there were also the stigmata of enchantment, which were the\r\nwork of the Devil, and very important was it to distinguish between\r\nthe two.[2051] It could only be done by great knowledge and great\r\npiety. It would appear that Guillaume's stigmata were not the work of\r\nthe devil; for it was resolved to employ him in the same manner as\r\nJeanne, as Catherine de la Rochelle, and as the two Breton women, the\r\nspiritual daughters of Friar Richard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2051: A. Maury, _La stigmatisation et les stigmates_, in\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_, 1854, ch. viii, pp. 454-482. Dr. Subled, _Les\r\nstigmates selon la science_, in _Science catholique_, 1894, vol. viii,\r\npp. 1073 _et seq._; vol. ix, pp. 2 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nWhen the Maid fell into the hands of the Burgundians, the Sire de la\r\nTremouille was with the King, on the Loire, where fighting had ceased\r\nsince the disastrous siege of La Charite. He sent the shepherd youth\r\nto the banks of the Oise, to the Lord Archbishop of Reims, who was\r\nthere opposing the Burgundians, commanded by Duke Philip, himself.\r\nMessire Regnault had probably asked for the boy. In any case he\r\nwelcomed him willingly and kept him at Beauvais, supervising and\r\ninterrogating him, ready to use him at an auspicious moment. One day,\r\neither to try him or because the rumour was really in circulation,\r\nyoung Guillaume was told that the English had put Jeanne to death.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said he, \"it will be the worse for them.\"[2052]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2052: Letter from Regnault de Chartres, in _Trial_, vol. v,\r\np. 168.]\r\n\r\nBy this time, after all the rivalries and jealousies which had torn\r\nasunder this company of the King's _beguines_, there remained to Friar\r\nRichard one only of his penitents, Dame Catherine of La Rochelle, who\r\nhad the gift of discovering hidden treasure.[2053] The young shepherd\r\napproved of the Maid as little as Dame Catherine had done.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2053: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 295 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n\"God suffered Jeanne to be taken,\" he said, \"because she was puffed up\r\nwith pride and because of the rich clothes she wore and because she\r\nhad not done as God commanded her but according to her own will.\"[2054]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2054: Letter from Regnault de Chartres, in _Ibid._, vol. v,\r\np. 168.]\r\n\r\nWere these words suggested to him by the enemies of the Maid? That may\r\nbe: but it is also possible that he derived them from inspiration.\r\nSaints are not always kind to one another.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Messire Regnault de Chartres believed himself possessed of a\r\nmarvel far surpassing the marvel he had lost. He wrote a letter to the\r\ninhabitants of his town of Reims telling them that the Maid had been\r\ntaken at Compiegne.\r\n\r\nThis misfortune had befallen her through her own fault, he added. \"She\r\nwould not take advice, but would follow her own will.\" In her stead\r\nGod had sent a shepherd, \"who says neither more nor less than Jeanne.\"\r\nGod has strictly commanded him to discomfit the English and the\r\nBurgundians. And the Lord Archbishop neglects not to repeat the words\r\nby which the prophet of Gevaudan had represented Jeanne as proud,\r\ngorgeous in attire, rebellious of heart.[2055] The Reverend Father in\r\nGod, my Lord Regnault, would never have consented to employ a heretic\r\nand a sorcerer; he believed in Guillaume as he had believed in Jeanne;\r\nhe held both one and the other to have been divinely sent, in the\r\nsense that all which is not of the devil is of God. It was sufficient\r\nfor him that no evil had been found in the child, and he intended to\r\nessay him, hoping that Guillaume would do what Jeanne had done.\r\nWhether the Archbishop thus acted rightly or wrongly the issue was to\r\ndecide, but he might have exalted the shepherd without denying the\r\nSaint who was so near her martyrdom. Doubtless he deemed it necessary\r\nto distinguish between the fortune of the kingdom and the fortune of\r\nJeanne. And he had the courage to do it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2055: _Ibid._, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MAID AT BEAUREVOIR--CATHERINE DE LA ROCHELLE AT PARIS--EXECUTION\r\nOF LA PIERRONNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maid had been taken captive in the diocese of Beauvais.[2056] At\r\nthat time the Bishop Count of Beauvais was Pierre Cauchon of Reims, a\r\ngreat and pompous clerk of the University of Paris, which had elected\r\nhim rector in 1403. Messire Pierre Cauchon was not a moderate man;\r\nwith great ardour he had thrown himself into the Cabochien riots.[2057]\r\nIn 1414, the Duke of Burgundy had sent him on an embassy to the\r\nCouncil of Constance to defend the doctrines of Jean Petit;[2058] then\r\nhe had appointed him Master of Requests in 1418, and finally raised\r\nhim to the episcopal see of Beauvais.[2059] Standing equally high in\r\nthe favour of the English, Messire Pierre was Councillor of King Henry\r\nVI, Almoner of France and Chancellor to the Queen of England. Since\r\n1423, his usual residence had been at Rouen. By their submission to\r\nKing Charles the people of Beauvais had deprived him of his episcopal\r\nrevenue.[2060] And, as the English said and believed that the army of\r\nthe King of France was at that time commanded by Friar Richard and the\r\nMaid, Messire Pierre Cauchon, the impoverished Bishop of Beauvais, had\r\na personal grievance against Jeanne. It would have been better for his\r\nown reputation that he should have abstained from avenging the\r\nChurch's honour on a damsel who was possibly an idolatress, a\r\nsoothsayer and the invoker of devils, but who had certainly incurred\r\nhis personal ill-will. He was in the Regent's pay;[2061] and the Regent\r\nwas filled with bitter hatred of the Maid.[2062] Again for his\r\nreputation's sake, my Lord Bishop of Beauvais should have reflected\r\nthat in prosecuting Jeanne for a matter of faith he was serving his\r\nmaster's wrath and furthering the temporal interests of the great of\r\nthis world. On these things he did not reflect; on the contrary, this\r\ncase at once temporal and spiritual, as ambiguous as his own position,\r\nexcited his worst passions. He flung himself into it with all the\r\nthoughtlessness of the violent. A maiden to be denounced, a heretic\r\nand an Armagnac to boot, what a feast for the prelate, the Councillor\r\nof King Henry! After having concerted with the doctors and masters of\r\nthe University of Paris, on the 14th of July, he presented himself\r\nbefore the camp of Compiegne and demanded the Maid as subject to his\r\njurisdiction.[2063]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2056: This point was not called in question at the time; but\r\nwhat might be discussed is whether the Bishop of Beauvais could\r\nexercise ordinary jurisdiction over the Maid.

Cauchon_, pp. 108 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nHe supported his demand by letters from the _Alma Mater_ to the Duke\r\nof Burgundy and the Lord Jean de Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nThe University made known to the most illustrious Prince, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, that once before it had claimed this woman, called the Maid,\r\nand had received no reply.\r\n\r\n\"We greatly fear,\" continued the doctors and masters, \"that by the\r\nfalse and seductive power of the Hellish Enemy and by the malice and\r\nsubtlety of wicked persons, your enemies and adversaries who, it is\r\nsaid, are making every effort to deliver this woman by crooked means,\r\nwill in some manner remove her out of your power.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore, the University hopes that so great a dishonour may be\r\nspared to the most Christian name of the house of France, and again it\r\nsupplicates your Highness, the Duke of Burgundy, to deliver over this\r\nwoman either to the Inquisitor of the evil of heresy or to my Lord\r\nBishop of Beauvais within whose spiritual jurisdiction she was\r\ncaptured.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows the letter which the doctors and masters of the\r\nUniversity entrusted to the Lord Bishop of Beauvais for the Lord Jean\r\nde Luxembourg:\r\n\r\n     Most noble, honoured and powerful lord, to your high\r\n     nobility we very affectionately commend us. Your noble\r\n     wisdom doth well know and recognise that all good Catholic\r\n     knights should employ their strength and their power first\r\n     in God's service and then for the common weal. Above all,\r\n     the first oath of the order of knighthood is to defend and\r\n     keep the honour of God, the Catholic Faith and holy Church.\r\n     This sacred oath was present to your mind when you employed\r\n     your noble power and your person in the taking of the woman\r\n     who calleth herself the Maid, by whom the glory of God hath\r\n     been infinitely offended, the Faith deeply wounded and the\r\n     Church greatly dishonoured: for through her there have\r\n     arisen in this kingdom, idolatries, errors, false doctrines\r\n     and other evils and misfortunes without end. And in truth\r\n     all loyal Christians must give unto you hearty thanks for\r\n     having rendered so great service to our holy Faith and to\r\n     all the kingdom. As for us, we thank God with all our\r\n     hearts, and you we thank for your noble prowess as\r\n     affectionately as we may. But such a capture alone would be\r\n     but a small thing were it not followed by a worthy issue\r\n     whereby this woman may answer for the offences she hath\r\n     committed against our merciful Creator, his faith and his\r\n     holy Church, as well as for her other evil deeds which are\r\n     said to be without number. The mischief would be greater\r\n     than ever, the people would be wrapped in yet grosser error\r\n     than before and his Divine Majesty too insufferably\r\n     offended, if matters continued in their present state, or if\r\n     it befell that this woman were delivered or retaken, as we\r\n     are told, is wished, plotted and endeavoured by divers of\r\n     our enemies, by all secret ways and by what is even worse by\r\n     bribe or by ransom. But it is our hope that God will not\r\n     permit so great an evil to betide his people, and that your\r\n     great and high wisdom will not suffer it so to befall but\r\n     will provide against it as becometh your nobility.\r\n\r\n     For if without the retribution that behoveth she were to be\r\n     delivered, irreparable would be the dishonour which should\r\n     fall on your great nobility and on all those who have dealt\r\n     in this matter. But your good and noble wisdom will know how\r\n     to devise means whereby such scandal shall cease as soon as\r\n     may be, whereof there is great need. And because all delay\r\n     in this matter is very perilous and very injurious to this\r\n     kingdom, very kindly and with a cordial affection do we\r\n     beseech your powerful and honoured nobility to grant that\r\n     for the glory of God, for the maintenance of the Holy\r\n     Catholic Faith, for the good and honour of the kingdom, this\r\n     woman be delivered up to justice and given over here to the\r\n     Inquisitor of the Faith, who hath demanded her and doth now\r\n     demand her urgently, in order that he may examine the\r\n     grievous charges under which she labours, so that God may be\r\n     satisfied and the folk duly edified in good and holy\r\n     doctrine. Or, an it please you better, hand over this woman\r\n     to the reverend Father in God, our highly honoured Lord\r\n     Bishop of Beauvais, who it is said hath likewise claimed\r\n     her, because she was taken within his jurisdiction. This\r\n     prelate and this inquisitor are judges of this woman in\r\n     matters of faith; and every Christian of whatsoever estate\r\n     owes them obedience in this case under heavy penalty of the\r\n     law. By so doing you will attain to the love and grace of\r\n     the most High and you will be the means of exalting the holy\r\n     Faith, and likewise will you glorify your own high and noble\r\n     name and also that of the most high and most powerful\r\n     Prince, our redoubtable Lord and yours, my Lord of Burgundy.\r\n     Every man shall be required to pray God for the prosperity\r\n     of your most noble worship, whom may it please God our\r\n     Saviour in his grace, to guide and keep in all his affairs\r\n     and finally to grant eternal joy.\r\n\r\n     Given at Paris, the 14th day of July, 1430.[2064]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2064: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 10, 11. M. Fournier, _La faculte\r\nde decret_, vol. i, p. 353, note.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that he bore these letters, the Reverend Father in\r\nGod, the Bishop of Beauvais was charged to offer money.[2065] To us it\r\nseems strange indeed that just at the very time when, by the mouth of\r\nthe University, he was representing to the Lord of Luxembourg that he\r\ncould not sell his prisoner without committing a crime, the Bishop\r\nshould himself offer to purchase her. According to these\r\necclesiastics, Jean would incur terrible penalties in this world and\r\nin the next, if in conformity with the laws and customs of war he\r\nsurrendered a prisoner held to ransom in return for money, and he\r\nwould win praise and blessing if he treacherously sold his captive to\r\nthose who wished to put her to death. But at least we might expect\r\nthat this Lord Bishop who had come to buy this woman for the Church,\r\nwould purchase her with the Church's money. Not at all! The purchase\r\nmoney is furnished by the English. In the end therefore she is\r\ndelivered not to the Church but to the English. And it is a priest,\r\nacting in the interests of God and of his Church, by virtue of his\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction, who concludes the bargain. He offers ten\r\nthousand golden francs, a sum in return for which, he says, according\r\nto the custom prevailing in France, the King has the right to claim\r\nany prisoner even were he of the blood royal.[2066]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2065: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 13, 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2066: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that the high and solemn ecclesiastic,\r\nPierre Cauchon, suspected Jeanne of witchcraft. Wishing to bring her\r\nto trial, he exercised his ecclesiastical functions. But he knew her\r\nto be the enemy of the English as well as of himself; there is no\r\ndoubt on that point. So when he wished to bring her to trial he acted\r\nas the Councillor of King Henry. Was it a witch or the enemy of the\r\nEnglish he was buying with his ten thousand gold francs? And if it\r\nwere merely a witch and an idolatress that the Holy Inquisitor, that\r\nthe University, that the Ordinary demanded for the glory of God, and\r\nat the price of gold, wherefore so much ado, wherefore so great an\r\nexpenditure of money? Would it not be better in this matter to act in\r\nconcert with the ecclesiastics of King Charles's party? The Armagnacs\r\nwere neither infidels nor heretics; they were neither Turks nor\r\nHussites; they were Catholics; they acknowledged the Pope of Rome to\r\nbe the true head of Christendom. The Dauphin Charles and his clergy\r\nhad not been excommunicated. Neither those who regarded the Treaty of\r\nTroyes as invalid nor those who had sworn to it had been pronounced\r\nanathema by the Pope. This was not a question of faith. In the\r\nprovinces ruled over by King Charles the Holy Inquisition prosecuted\r\nheresy in a curious manner and the secular arm saw to it that the\r\nsentences pronounced by the Church did not remain a dead letter. The\r\nArmagnacs burned witches just as much as the French and the\r\nBurgundians. For the present doubtless they did not believe the Maid\r\nto be possessed by devils; most of them on the contrary were inclined\r\nto regard her as a saint. But might they not be undeceived? Would it\r\nnot be good Christian charity to present them with fine canonical\r\narguments? If the Maid's case were really a case for the\r\necclesiastical court why not join with Churchmen of both parties and\r\ntake her before the Pope and the Council? And just at that time a\r\nCouncil for the reformation of the Church and the establishment of\r\npeace in the kingdom was sitting in the town of Bale; the University\r\nwas sending its delegates, who would there meet the ecclesiastics of\r\nKing Charles, also Gallicans and firmly attached to the privileges of\r\nthe Church of France.[2067] Why not have this Armagnac prophetess\r\ntried by the assembled Fathers? But for the sake of Henry of Lancaster\r\nand the glory of Old England matters had to take another turn. The\r\nRegent's Councillors were already accusing Jeanne of witchcraft when\r\nshe summoned them in the name of the King of Heaven to depart out of\r\nFrance. During the siege of Orleans, they wanted to burn her heralds\r\nand said that if they had her they would burn her also at the stake.\r\nSuch in good sooth was their firm intent and their unvarying\r\nintimation. This does not look as if they would be likely to hand her\r\nover to the Church as soon as she was taken. In their own kingdom they\r\nburned as many witches and wizards as possible; but they had never\r\nsuffered the Holy Inquisition to be established in their land, and\r\nthey were ill acquainted with that form of justice. Informed that\r\nJeanne was in the hands of the Sire de Luxembourg, the Great Council\r\nof England were unanimously in favour of her being purchased at any\r\nprice. Divers lords recommended that as soon as they obtained\r\npossession of the Maid she should be sewn in a sack and cast into the\r\nriver. But one of them (it is said to have been the Earl of Warwick)\r\nrepresented to them that she ought first to be tried, convicted of\r\nheresy and witchcraft by an ecclesiastical tribunal, and then solemnly\r\ndegraded in order that her King might be degraded with her.[2068] What\r\na disgrace for Charles of Valois, calling himself King of France, if\r\nthe University of Paris, if the French ecclesiastical dignitaries,\r\nbishops, abbots, canons, if in short the Church Universal were to\r\ndeclare that a witch had sat in his Council and that a witch led his\r\nhost, that one possessed had conducted him to his impious,\r\nsacrilegious and void anointing! Thus would the trial of the Maid be\r\nthe trial of Charles VII, the condemnation of the Maid the\r\ncondemnation of Charles VII. The idea seemed good to them and was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2067: Du Boulay, _Historia Universitatis Parisiensis_, vol.\r\nv, pp. 393-408. _Monumenta conciliorum generalium seculi decimi\r\nquinti_, vol. i, pp. 70 _et seq._ Le P.

Prarond, Paris, 1889, book iv, p.\r\n100.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop of Beauvais was eager to put it into execution. He, a\r\npriest and Councillor of State, was consumed with a desire, under the\r\nsemblance of trying an unfortunate heretic, to sit in judgment on the\r\ndescendant of Clovis, of Saint Charlemagne and of Saint Louis.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, the Sire de Luxembourg had the Maid taken from\r\nBeaulieu, which was not safe enough, to Beaurevoir, near Cambrai.[2069]\r\nThere dwelt Dame Jeanne de Luxembourg and Dame Jeanne de Bethune.\r\nJeanne de Luxembourg was the aunt of Lord Jean, whom she loved dearly.\r\nAmong the great of this world she had lived as a saint, and she had\r\nnever married. Formerly lady-in-waiting to Queen Ysabeau, King Charles\r\nVII's godmother, one of the most important events of her life had been\r\nto solicit from Pope Martin the canonisation of her Brother, the\r\nCardinal of Luxembourg, who had died at Avignon in his ninetieth year.\r\nShe was known as the Demoiselle de Luxembourg. She was sixty-seven\r\nyears of age, infirm and near her end.[2070]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2069: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 109, 110; vol. ii, p. 298; vol.\r\niii, p. 121. Monstrelet, vol. iv, p. 389. E.

She was reputed pitiful,\r\nbecause, in 1424, she had obtained from her husband the pardon of a\r\nnobleman of Picardy, who had been brought prisoner to Beaurevoir and\r\nwas in great danger of being beheaded and quartered.[2071]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2071: A. Duchene, _Histoire de la maison de Bethune_, ch.\r\niii, and proofs and illustrations, p. 33. Vallet de Viriville, _loc.\r\ncit._, and Morosini, vol. iv, pp. 352, 354.]\r\n\r\nThese two ladies treated Jeanne kindly. They offered her woman's\r\nclothes or cloth with which to make them; and they urged her to\r\nabandon a dress which appeared to them unseemly. Jeanne refused,\r\nalleging that she had not received permission from Our Lord and that\r\nit was not yet time; later she admitted that had she been able to quit\r\nman's attire, she would have done so at the request of these two dames\r\nrather than for any other dame of France, the Queen excepted.[2072]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2072: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 95, 231.]\r\n\r\nA noble of the Burgundian party, one Aimond de Macy, often came to see\r\nher and was pleased to converse with her. To him she seemed modest in\r\nword and in deed. Still Sire Aimond, who was but thirty, had found her\r\npersonally attractive.[2073] If certain witnesses of her own party are\r\nto be believed, Jeanne, although beautiful, did not inspire men with\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2073: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 438, 457; vol. iii, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nThis singular grace however applied to the Armagnacs only; it was not\r\nextended to the Burgundians, and Seigneur Aimond did not experience\r\nit, for one day he tried to thrust his hand into her bosom. She\r\nresisted and repulsed him with all her strength. Lord Aimond concluded\r\nas more than one would have done in his place that this was a damsel\r\nof rare virtue. He took warning.[2074]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2074: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 120, 121.]\r\n\r\nConfined in the castle keep, Jeanne's mind was for ever running on her\r\nreturn to her friends at Compiegne; her one idea was to escape.\r\nSomehow there reached her evil tidings from France. She got the idea\r\nthat all the inhabitants of Compiegne over seven years of age were to\r\nbe massacred, \"to perish by fire and sword,\" she said; and indeed such\r\na fate was bound to overtake them if the town were taken.\r\n\r\nConfiding her distress and her unconquerable desire to Saint\r\nCatherine, she asked: \"How can God abandon to destruction those good\r\nfolk of Compiegne who have been so loyal to their Lord?\"[2075]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2075: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 150.]\r\n\r\nAnd in her dream, surrounded by saints, like the donors in church\r\npictures, kneeling and in rapture, she wrestled with her heavenly\r\ncounsellors for the poor folk of Compiegne.\r\n\r\nWhat she had heard of their fate caused her infinite distress; she\r\nherself would rather die than continue to live after such a\r\ndestruction of worthy people. For this reason she was strongly tempted\r\nto leap from the top of the keep. And because she knew all that could\r\nbe said against it, she heard her Voices putting her in mind of those\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nNearly every day Saint Catherine said to her: \"Do not leap, God will\r\nhelp both you and those of Compiegne.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jeanne replied to her: \"Since God will help those of Compiegne, I\r\nwant to be there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd once again Saint Catherine told her the marvellous story of the\r\nshepherdess and the King: \"To all things must you be resigned. And you\r\nwill not be delivered until you have seen the King of the English.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Jeanne made answer: \"But in good sooth I do not desire to see\r\nhim. I would rather die than fall into the hands of the English.\"[2076]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2076: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 150, 151.]\r\n\r\nOne day she heard a rumour that the English had come to fetch her. The\r\narrival of the Lord Bishop of Beauvais who came to offer the blood\r\nmoney at Beaurevoir may have given rise to the report.[2077]\r\nStraightway Jeanne became frantic and beside herself. She ceased to\r\nlisten to her Voices, who forbade her the fatal leap. The keep was at\r\nleast seventy feet high; she commended her soul to God and leapt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2077: _Ibid._, p. 13; vol. v, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nHaving fallen to the ground, she heard cries: \"She is dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe guards hurried to the spot. Finding her still alive, in their\r\namazement they could only ask: \"Did you leap?\"\r\n\r\nShe felt sorely shaken; but Saint Catherine spoke to her and said: \"Be\r\nof good courage. You will recover.\" At the same time the Saint gave\r\nher good tidings of her friends. \"You will recover and the people of\r\nCompiegne will receive succour.\" And she added that this succour would\r\ncome before Saint Martin's Day in the winter.[2078]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2078: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 110, 151, 152.]\r\n\r\nHenceforth Jeanne believed that it was her saints who had helped her\r\nand guarded her from death. She knew well that she had been wrong in\r\nattempting such a leap, despite her Voices.\r\n\r\nSaint Catherine said to her: \"You must confess and ask God to forgive\r\nyou for having leapt.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne did confess and ask pardon of Our Lord. And after her\r\nconfession Saint Catherine made known unto her that God had forgiven\r\nher. For three or four days she remained without eating or drinking;\r\nthen she took some food and was whole.[2079]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2079: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 166. _Journal d'un bourgeois de\r\nParis_, p. 268. J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, pp. 53, 58.]\r\n\r\nAnother story was told of the leap from Beaurevoir; it was related\r\nthat she had tried to escape through a window letting herself down by\r\na sheet or something that broke; but we must believe the Maid: she\r\nsays she leapt; if she had been attached to a cord, she would not have\r\ncommitted sin and would not have confessed. This leap was known and\r\nthe rumour spread abroad that she had escaped and joined her own\r\nparty.[2080]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2080: _Chronique des cordeliers_, fol. 507, recto. Morosini,\r\nvol. iii, pp. 301-303. _Chronique de Tournai_, ed. Smedt, in _Recueil\r\ndes Chroniques de Flandre_, vol. iii, pp. 416, 417.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lenten sermons at Orleans had been delivered by that\r\ngood preacher, Friar Richard, who was ill content with Jeanne, and\r\nwhom Jeanne disliked and had quitted. The townsfolk as a token of\r\nregard presented him with the image of Jesus sculptured in copper by a\r\ncertain Philippe, a metal-worker of the city. And the bookseller, Jean\r\nMoreau, bound him a book of hours at the town's expense.[2081]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2081: Lottin, _Recherches sur la ville d'Orleans_, vol. i, p.\r\n252. _Trial_, vol. i, p. 99, note 1. _Journal du siege_, pp. 235-238.\r\nS. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, p. cclxiii, note 2.]\r\n\r\nHe brought back Queen Marie to Jargeau and succeeded in obtaining her\r\nfavour. Jeanne was spared the bitterness of learning that while she\r\nwas languishing in prison her friends at Orleans, her fair Dauphin and\r\nhis Queen Marie, were making good cheer for the monk who had turned\r\nfrom her to prefer a dame Catherine whom she considered\r\nworthless.[2082] Only lately the idea of employing Dame Catherine had\r\nfilled Jeanne with alarm; she wrote to her King about it, and as soon\r\nas she saw him besought him not to employ her. However the King set no\r\nstore by what she had said; he agreed to Friar Richard's favourite\r\nbeing allowed to set forth on her mission to obtain money from the\r\ngood towns and to negotiate peace with the Duke of Burgundy. But\r\nperhaps this saintly dame was not possessed of all the wisdom\r\nnecessary for the performance of man's work and King's service. For\r\nimmediately she became a cause of embarrassment to her friends.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2082: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 296, 297.]\r\n\r\nBeing in the town of Tours, she fell to saying: \"In this town there be\r\ncarpenters who work, but not at houses, and if ye have not a care,\r\nthis town is in the way to a bad end and there be those in the town\r\nthat know it.\"[2083]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2083: Register of the Accounts of the town of Tours for the\r\nyear 1430, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 473, note 1.]\r\n\r\nThis was a denunciation in the form of a parable. Dame Catherine was\r\nthereby accusing the churchmen and burgesses of Tours of working\r\nagainst Charles of Valois, their lord. The woman must have been held\r\nto have influence with the King, his kinsmen and his Council; for the\r\ninhabitants of Tours took fright and sent an Augustinian monk, Brother\r\nJean Bourget, to King Charles, to the Queen of Sicily, to the Bishop\r\nof Seez, and to the Lord of Treves, to inquire whether the words of\r\nthis holy woman had been believed by them. The Queen of Sicily and the\r\nCouncillors of King Charles gave the monk letters wherein they\r\nannounced to the townsfolk of Tours that they had never heard of such\r\nthings, and King Charles declared that he had every confidence in the\r\nchurchmen, the burgesses and the other citizens of his town of\r\nTours.[2084]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2084: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 473.]\r\n\r\nDame Catherine had in like manner slandered the inhabitants of\r\nAngers.[2085]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2085: _Ibid._, p. 473.]\r\n\r\nWhether, following the example of the Blessed Colette of Corbie, this\r\ndevout person wished to pass from one party to the other, or whether\r\nshe had chanced to be taken captive by Burgundian men-at-arms, she was\r\nbrought before the Official at Paris. In their interrogation of her\r\nthe ecclesiastics appear to have been concerned less about her than\r\nabout the Maid Jeanne, whose prosecution was then being instituted.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Maid, Catherine said: \"Jeanne has two\r\ncounsellors, whom she calls Counsellors of the Spring.\"[2086]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2086: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 295.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the confused recollection of the conversations she had had at\r\nJargeau and at Montfaucon. The term Council was the one Jeanne usually\r\nemployed when speaking of her Voices; but Dame Catherine was confusing\r\nJeanne's heavenly visitants with what the Maid had told her of the\r\nGooseberry Spring at Domremy.\r\n\r\nIf Jeanne felt unkindly towards Catherine, Catherine did not feel\r\nkindly towards Jeanne. She did not assert Jeanne's mission to be\r\nnought; but she let it be clearly understood that the hapless damsel,\r\nthen a prisoner in the hands of the Burgundians, was addicted to\r\ninvoking evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\"If Jeanne be not well guarded,\" Catherine told the Official, \"she\r\nwill escape from prison with the aid of the devil.\"[2087]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2087: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 106, note. _Journal d'un bourgeois\r\nde Paris_, p. 271. Vallet de Viriville, _Proces de condamnation de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, pp. lxi-lxv.]\r\n\r\nWhether Jeanne was or was not aided by the devil was a matter to be\r\ndecided between herself and the doctors of the church. But it is\r\ncertain that her one thought was to burst her bonds, and that she was\r\nceaselessly imagining means of escape. Catherine de la Rochelle knew\r\nher well and wished her ill.\r\n\r\nCatherine was released. Her ecclesiastical judges would not have\r\ntreated her so leniently had she spoken well of the Maid. The La\r\nRochelle Dame returned to King Charles.[2088]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2088: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 271.]\r\n\r\nThe two religious women who had followed Jeanne on her departure from\r\nSully and had been taken at Corbeil, Pierronne of Lower Brittany and\r\nher companion, had been confined in ecclesiastical prisons at Paris\r\nsince the spring. They openly said that God had sent them to succour\r\nthe Maid Jeanne. Friar Richard had been their spiritual father and\r\nthey had been in the Maid's company. Wherefore they were strongly\r\nsuspected of having offended against God and his Holy Religion. The\r\nGrand Inquisitor of France, Brother Jean Graverent, Prior of the\r\nJacobins at Paris, prosecuted them according to the forms usual in\r\nthat country. He proceeded in concurrence with the Ordinary,\r\nrepresented by the official.\r\n\r\nPierronne maintained and believed it to be true that Jeanne was good,\r\nand that what she did was well done and according to God's will. She\r\nadmitted that on the Christmas night of that year, at Jargeau, Friar\r\nRichard had twice given her the body of Jesus Christ and had given it\r\nthree times to Jeanne.[2089] Besides, the fact had been well proved by\r\ninformation gathered from eye-witnesses. The judges, who were\r\nauthorities on this subject, held that the monk should not thus have\r\nlavished the bread of angels on such women. However, since frequent\r\ncommunion was not formally forbidden by canon law, Pierronne could not\r\nbe censured for having received it. The informers, who were then\r\ngiving evidence against Jeanne, did not remember the three communions\r\nat Jargeau.[2090]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2089: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 271, 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2090: Voltaire, _Dictionnaire philosophique_, article, Arc.]\r\n\r\nHeavier charges weighed upon the two Breton women. They were labouring\r\nunder the accusation of witchcraft and sorcery.\r\n\r\nPierronne stated and took her oath that God often appeared to her in\r\nhuman form and spoke to her as friend to friend, and that the last\r\ntime she had seen him he was clothed in a purple cloak and a long\r\nwhite robe.[2091]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2091: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 259, 260.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrious masters who were trying her, represented to her that\r\nto speak thus of such apparitions was to blaspheme. And these women\r\nwere convicted of being possessed by evil spirits, who caused them to\r\nerr in word and in deed.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 3rd of September, 1430, they were taken to the Parvis\r\nNotre Dame to hear a sermon. Platforms had been erected as usual, and\r\nSunday had been chosen as the day in order that folk might benefit\r\nfrom this edifying spectacle. A famous doctor addressed a charitable\r\nexhortation to both women. One of them, the youngest, as she listened\r\nto him and looked at the stake that had been erected, was filled with\r\nrepentance. She confessed that she had been seduced by an angel of the\r\ndevil and duly renounced her error.\r\n\r\nPierronne, on the contrary, refused to retract. She obstinately\r\npersisted in the belief that she saw God often, clothed as she had\r\nsaid. The Church could do nothing for her. Given over to the secular\r\narm, she was straightway conducted to the stake which had been\r\nprepared for her, and burned alive by the executioner.[2092]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2092: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 259-260,\r\n271-272. Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 504. A. de\r\nla Borderie, _Pierronne et Perrinaic_, pp. 7 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThus did the Grand Inquisitor of France and the Bishop of Paris\r\ncruelly cause to perish by an ignominious death one of those women who\r\nhad followed Friar Richard, one of the saints of the Dauphin Charles.\r\nBut the most famous of these women and the most abounding in works was\r\nin their hands. The death of La Pierronne was an earnest of the fate\r\nreserved for the Maid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBEAUREVOIR--ARRAS--ROUEN--THE TRIAL FOR LAPSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1430, two inhabitants of Tournai, the chief\r\nalderman, Bietremieu Carlier, and the chief Councillor, Henri Romain,\r\nwere returning from the banks of the Loire, whither their town had\r\ndespatched them on a mission to the King of France. They stopped at\r\nBeaurevoir. Albeit this place lay upon their direct route and afforded\r\nthem a halt between two stages of their journey, one cannot help\r\nsupposing some connection to have existed between their mission to\r\nCharles of Valois and their arrival in the domain of the Sire de\r\nLuxembourg. The existence of such a connection seems all the more\r\nprobable when we remember the attachment of their fellow-citizens to\r\nthe Fleurs-de-Lis, and when we know the relations already existing\r\nbetween the Maid and these emissaries.[2093]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2093: H. Vandenbroeck, _Extraits des anciens registres des\r\nconsaux de la ville de Tournai_, vol. ii (1422-1430), and Morosini,\r\nvol. iii, pp. 185, 186.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the district of the provost of Tournai was loyal\r\nto the King of France, who had granted it freedom and privileges.\r\nMessage after message it sent him; it organised public processions in\r\nhis honour, and it was ready to grant him anything, so long as he\r\ndemanded neither men nor money. The alderman, Carlier, and the\r\nCouncillor, Romain, had both previously gone to Reims as\r\nrepresentatives of their town to witness the anointing and the\r\ncoronation of King Charles. There they had doubtless seen the Maid in\r\nher glory and had held her to be a very great saint. In those days,\r\ntheir town, attentively watching the progress of the royal army, was\r\nin regular correspondence with the warlike _beguine_, and with her\r\nconfessor, Friar Richard, or more probably Friar Pasquerel. To-day\r\nthey wended to the castle, wherein she was imprisoned in the hands of\r\nher cruel enemies. We know not what it was they came to say to the\r\nSire de Luxembourg, nor even whether he received them. He cannot have\r\nrefused to hear them if he thought they came to make secret offers on\r\nthe part of King Charles for the ransom of the Maid, who had fought in\r\nhis battles. We know not, either, whether they were able to see the\r\nprisoner. The idea that they did enter her presence is quite tenable;\r\nfor in those days it was generally easy to approach captives, and\r\npassers by when they visited them were given every facility for the\r\nperformance of one of the seven works of mercy.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, is certain; that when they left Beaurevoir, they\r\ncarried with them a letter which Jeanne had given them, charging them\r\nto deliver it to the magistrates of their town. In this letter she\r\nasked the folk of Tournai, for the sake of her Lord the King and in\r\nview of the good services she had rendered him, to send unto her\r\ntwenty or thirty crowns, that she might employ them for her\r\nnecessities.[2094]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2094: H. Vandenbroeck, _Extraits analytiques des anciens\r\nregistres des consaux de la ville de Tournai_, vol. ii, pp. 338,\r\n371-373. Canon H. Debout, _Jeanne d'Arc et les villes d'Arras et de\r\nTournai_, Paris, n.d., p. 24.]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days thus to permit prisoners to beg their\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Demoiselle de Luxembourg, who had just made her\r\nwill, and had but a few days longer to live,[2095] entreated her noble\r\nnephew not to give the Maid up to the English.[2096] But what power had\r\nthis good dame against the Norman gold of the King of England and\r\nagainst the anathemas of Holy Church? For if my Lord Jean had refused\r\nto give up this damsel suspected of enchantments, of idolatries, of\r\ninvoking devils and committing other crimes against religion, he would\r\nhave been excommunicated. The venerable University of Paris had not\r\nneglected to make him aware that a refusal would expose him to heavy\r\nlegal penalties.[2097]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2095: Le P. Anselme, _Histoire genealogique de la maison de\r\nFrance_, vol. iii, pp. 723, 724. Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de\r\nCharles VII_, vol. ii, pp. 175, 176.

My Lord Philip consented and, by his\r\ncommand, Jeanne was taken to Arras. This town was encircled by high\r\nwalls; it had two castles, one of which, La Cour-le-Comte, was in the\r\ncentre of the town. It was probably in the cells of Cour-le-Comte that\r\nJeanne was confined, under the watch and ward of my Lord David de\r\nBrimeu, Lord of Ligny, Knight of the Golden Fleece, Governor of Arras.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was rare for prisoners to be kept in isolation.[2099]\r\nAt Arras, Jeanne received visitors; and among others, a Scotsman, who\r\nshowed her her portrait, in which she was represented kneeling on one\r\nknee and presenting a letter to her King.[2100] This letter might be\r\nsupposed to have been from the Sire de Baudricourt, or from any other\r\nclerk or captain by whom the painter may have thought Jeanne to have\r\nbeen sent to the Dauphin; it might have been a letter announcing to\r\nthe King the deliverance of Orleans or the victory of Patay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2099: \"Was waited on in prison like a lady,\" says _Le Journal\r\nd'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 271, concerning the Rouen prison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2100: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 100.]\r\n\r\nThis was the only portrait of herself Jeanne ever saw and, for her own\r\npart, she never had any painted; but during the brief duration of her\r\npower, the inhabitants of the French towns placed images of her,\r\ncarved and painted, in the chapels of the saints, and wore leaden\r\nmedals on which she was represented; thus in her case following a\r\ncustom established in honour of the saints canonised by the\r\nChurch.[2101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2101: _Ibid._, pp. 101, 206, 291; vol. iii, p. 87; vol. v,\r\npp. 104, 305.

This ecclesiastic enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of his fellow citizens, who employed him in the town's most\r\nurgent affairs. In the May of this year, 1430, he had been sent to\r\nMessire Regnault de Chartres, Chancellor of King Charles. He had been\r\ntaken by the Burgundians at the same time as Jeanne and held to\r\nransom; but out of that predicament he soon escaped and at no great\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nHe acquitted himself well of his mission[2102] to the Maid, and, it\r\nwould seem, received nothing for his trouble, doubtless because he\r\nwanted the reward of this work of mercy to be placed to his account in\r\nheaven.[2103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2102: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 95, 96, 231.

Champion, _Notes sur Jeanne d'Arc, II; Jeanne d'Arc a\r\nArras_, in _Le Moyen Age_, July-August, 1907, pp. 200, 201.]\r\n\r\nNeither the capture of the Maid nor the retreat of the men-at-arms she\r\nhad brought, put an end to the siege of Compiegne. Guillaume de Flavy\r\nand his two brothers, Charles and Louis, and Captain Baretta with his\r\nItalians, and the five hundred of the garrison[2104] displayed skill,\r\nvigour, and untiring energy. The Burgundians conducted the siege in\r\nthe same manner as the English had conducted that of Orleans; mines,\r\ntrenches, bulwarks, cannonades and bastions, those gigantic and absurd\r\nerections good for nothing but for burning. The suburbs of the town\r\nGuillaume de Flavy had demolished because they were in the way of his\r\nfiring; boats he had sunk in order to bar the river. To the mortars\r\nand huge _couillards_ of the Burgundians he replied with his\r\nartillery, and notably with those little copper culverins which did\r\nsuch good service.[2105] If the gay cannoneer of Orleans and Jargeau,\r\nMaitre Jean de Montesclere, were absent, there was a shoemaker of\r\nValenciennes, an artilleryman, named Noirouffle, tall, dark, terrible\r\nto see, and terrible to hear.[2106] The townsfolk of Compiegne, like\r\nthose of Orleans, made unsuccessful sallies. One day Louis de Flavy,\r\nthe governor's brother, was killed by a Burgundian bullet. But none\r\nthe less on that day Guillaume did as he was wont to do and made the\r\nminstrels play to keep his men-at-arms in good cheer.[2107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2104: H. de Lepinois, _Notes extraites des archives\r\ncommunales de Compiegne_, in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_,\r\n1863, vol. xxiv, p. 486.

In like manner, the capture of Les Tourelles had not\r\noccasioned the fall of the town of Duke Charles.[2108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2108: Monstrelet, vol. iv, pp. 390, 391.

The Burgundians were\r\nunable to invest Compiegne because its circumference was too\r\ngreat.[2109] They were short of money; and their men-at-arms, for lack\r\nof food and of pay, deserted with that perfect assurance which in\r\nthose days characterised alike mercenaries of the red cross and of the\r\nwhite.[2110] To complete his misfortunes, Duke Philip was obliged to\r\ntake away some of the troops engaged in the siege and send them\r\nagainst the inhabitants of Liege who had revolted.[2111] On the 24th of\r\nOctober, a relieving army, commanded by the Count of Vendome and the\r\nMarshal de Boussac, approached Compiegne. The English and the\r\nBurgundians having turned to encounter them, the garrison and all the\r\ninhabitants of the town, even the women, fell upon the rear of the\r\nbesiegers and routed them.[2112] The relieving army entered Compiegne.\r\nThe flaring of the bastions was a fine sight. The Duke of Burgundy\r\nlost all his artillery.[2113] The Sire de Luxembourg, who had come to\r\nBeaurevoir, where he had received the Count Bishop of Beauvais, now\r\nappeared before Compiegne just in time to bear his share in the\r\ndisaster.[2114] The same causes which had constrained the English to\r\ndepart, as they put it, from Orleans, now obliged the Burgundians to\r\nleave Compiegne. But in those days the most ordinary events must needs\r\nhave a supernatural cause assigned to them, wherefore the deliverance\r\nof the town was attributed to the vow of the Count of Vendome, who, in\r\nthe cathedral of Senlis, had promised an annual mass to\r\nNotre-Dame-de-la-Pierre if the place were not taken.[2115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2109: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. i, pp. 49 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2110: _Chronique des cordeliers_, fol. 502 verso.

The Count Bishop of Beauvais, who was\r\ntaking this matter to heart, urged the Sire de Luxembourg to come to\r\nterms, mingled threats with coaxings, and caused the Norman gold to\r\nglitter before his eyes. He seemed to fear, and his fear was shared by\r\nthe masters and doctors of the University, that King Charles would\r\nlikewise make an offer, that he would promise more than King Henry's\r\nten thousand golden francs and that in the end, by dint of costly\r\ngifts, the Armagnacs would succeed in winning back their\r\nfairy-godmother.[2116] The rumour ran that King Charles, hearing that\r\nthe English were about to gain possession of Jeanne for a sum of\r\nmoney, sent an ambassador to warn the Duke of Burgundy not on any\r\naccount to consent to such an agreement, adding that if he did, the\r\nBurgundians in the hands of the King of France would be made to pay\r\nfor the fate of the Maid.[2117] Doubtless the rumour was false; albeit\r\nthe fears of the Lord Bishop and the masters of the Paris University\r\nwere not entirely groundless; and it is certain that from the banks of\r\nthe Loire the negotiations were being attentively followed with a view\r\nto intervention at a favourable moment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2116: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 9.

It\r\nwas decided to take her to Rouen, through Ponthieu, along the\r\nsea-shore, through the north of Normandy, where there would be less\r\nrisk of falling in with the scouts of the various parties.\r\n\r\nFrom Arras she was taken to the Chateau of Drugy, where the monks of\r\nSaint-Riquier were said to have visited her in prison.[2119] She was\r\nafterwards taken to Crotoy, where the castle walls were washed by the\r\nocean waves. The Duke of Alencon, whom she called her fair Duke, had\r\nbeen imprisoned there after the Battle of Verneuil.[2120] At the time\r\nof her arrival, Maitre Nicolas Gueuville, Chancellor of the Cathedral\r\nchurch of Notre Dame d'Amiens, was a prisoner in that castle in the\r\nhands of the English. He heard her confess and administered the\r\nCommunion to her.[2121] And there on that vast Bay of the Somme, grey\r\nand monotonous, with its low sky traversed by sea-birds in their long\r\nflight, Jeanne beheld coming down to her the visitant of earlier days,\r\nthe Archangel Saint Michael; and she was comforted. It was said that\r\nthe damsels and burgesses of Abbeville went to see her in the castle\r\nwhere she was imprisoned.[2122] At the time of the coronation, these\r\nburgesses had thought of turning French; and they would have done so\r\nif King Charles had come to their town; he did not come; and perhaps\r\nit was through Christian charity that the folk of Abbeville visited\r\nJeanne; but those among them who thought well of her did not say so,\r\nfor fear they too should be suspected of heresy.[2123]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2119: Chronicle of Jean de la Chapelle, in _Trial_, vol. v,\r\npp. 358-360.

In November, after they had been informed\r\nof the conclusion of the bargain between Jean de Luxembourg and the\r\nEnglish, they wrote through their rector to the Lord Bishop of\r\nBeauvais reproaching him for his delay in the matter of this woman and\r\nexhorting him to be more diligent.\r\n\r\n\"For you it is no slight matter, holding as you do so high an office\r\nin God's Church,\" ran this letter, \"that the scandals committed\r\nagainst the Christian religion be stamped out, especially when such\r\nscandals arise within your actual jurisdiction.\"[2124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2124: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 15, 16.

He was a sad, serious child, harshly treated by the\r\nEarl of Warwick, who was governor of the castle.[2127] The castle was\r\nstrongly fortified;[2128] it had seven towers, including the keep.\r\nJeanne was placed in a tower looking on to the open country.[2129] Her\r\nroom was on the middle storey, between the dungeon and the state\r\napartment. Eight steps led up to it.[2130] It extended over the whole\r\nof that floor, which was forty-three feet across, including the\r\nwalls.[2131] A stone staircase approached it at an angle. There was but\r\na dim light, for some of the window slits had been filled in.[2132]\r\nFrom a locksmith of Rouen, one Etienne Castille, the English had\r\nordered an iron cage, in which it was said to be impossible to stand\r\nupright. If the reports of the ecclesiastical registrars are to be\r\nbelieved, Jeanne was placed in it and chained by the neck, feet, and\r\nhands,[2133] and left there till the opening of the trial. At Jean\r\nSalvart's, at _l'Ecu de France_, in front of the Official's\r\ncourtyard,[2134] a mason's apprentice saw the cage weighed. But no one\r\never found Jeanne in it. If this treatment were inflicted on Jeanne,\r\nit was not invented for her; when Captain La Hire, in the February of\r\nthis same year, 1430, took Chateau Gaillard, near Rouen, he found the\r\ngood knight Barbazan in an iron cage, from which he would not come\r\nout, alleging that he was a prisoner on parole.[2135] Jeanne, on the\r\ncontrary, had been careful to promise nothing, or rather she had\r\npromised to escape as soon as she could.[2136] Therefore the English,\r\nwho believed that she had magical powers, mistrusted her greatly.[2137]\r\nAs she was being prosecuted by the Church, she ought to have been\r\ndetained in an ecclesiastical prison,[2138] but the _Godons_ were\r\nresolved to keep her in their custody. One among them said she was\r\ndear to them because they had paid dearly for her. On her feet they\r\nput shackles and round her waist a chain padlocked to a beam five or\r\nsix feet long. At night this chain was carried over the foot of her\r\nbed and attached to the principal beam.[2139] In like manner, John\r\nHuss, in 1415, when he was delivered up to the Bishop of Constance and\r\ntransferred to the fortress of Gottlieben, was chained night and day\r\nuntil he was taken to the stake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2126: A.

They\r\nmocked her and she rebuked them, a circumstance they must have found\r\nconsolatory. At night two of them stayed behind the door; three\r\nremained with her, and constantly troubled her by saying first that\r\nshe would die, then that she would be delivered. No one could speak to\r\nher without their consent.[2142]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2140: Lea, _A History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages_\r\n(1906), vol. iii, p. 359.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2141: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2142: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 318, 319; vol. iii, pp. 131, 140,\r\n148, 161. A. Sarrazin, _P. Cauchon_, p. 200.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless folk entered the prison as if it were a fair (_comme au\r\nmoulin_); people of all ranks came to see Jeanne as they pleased. Thus\r\nMaitre Laurent Guesdon, Lieutenant of the Bailie of Rouen, came,[2143]\r\nand Maitre Pierre Manuel, Advocate of the King of England, who was\r\naccompanied by Maitre Pierre Daron, magistrate of the city of Rouen.\r\nThey found her with her feet in shackles, guarded by soldiers.[2144]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2143: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 186, 187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2144: _Ibid._, pp. 199, 200.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Pierre Manuel felt called upon to tell her that for certain she\r\nwould never have come there if she had not been brought. Sensible\r\npersons were always surprised when they saw witches and soothsayers\r\nfalling into a trap like any ordinary Christian. The King's Advocate\r\nmust have been a sensible person, since his surprise appeared in the\r\nquestions he put to Jeanne.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know you were to be taken?\" he asked her.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it likely,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then why,\" asked Maitre Pierre again, \"if you thought it likely, did\r\nyou not take better care on the day you were captured?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew neither the day nor the hour when I should be taken, nor when\r\nit should happen.\"[2145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2145: _Ibid._, p. 200.]\r\n\r\nA young fellow, one Pierre Cusquel, who worked for Jean Salvart, also\r\ncalled Jeanson, the master-mason of the castle, through the influence\r\nof his employer, was permitted to enter the tower. He also found\r\nJeanne bound with a long chain attached to a beam, and with her feet\r\nin shackles. Much later, he claimed to have warned her to be careful\r\nof what she said, because her life was involved in it. It is true that\r\nshe talked volubly to her guards and that all she said was reported\r\nto her judges. And it may have happened that the young Pierre, whose\r\nmaster was on the English side, wished to advise her and even did so.\r\nThere is a suspicion, however, that like so many others he was merely\r\nboasting.[2146]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2146: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 179.]\r\n\r\nThe Sire Jean de Luxembourg came to Rouen. He went to the Maid's tower\r\naccompanied by his brother, the Lord Bishop of Therouanne, Chancellor\r\nof England; and also by Humphrey, Earl of Stafford, Constable of\r\nFrance for King Henry; and the Earl of Warwick, Governor of the Castle\r\nof Rouen. At this interview there was also present the young Seigneur\r\nde Macy, who held Jeanne to be of very modest bearing, since she had\r\nrepulsed his attempted familiarity.\r\n\r\n\"Jeanne,\" said the Sire de Luxembourg, \"I have come to ransom you if\r\nyou will promise never again to bear arms against us.\"\r\n\r\nThese words do not accord with our knowledge of the negotiation for\r\nthe purchase of the Maid. They seem to indicate that even then the\r\ncontract was not complete, or at any rate that the vendor thought he\r\ncould break it if he chose. But the most remarkable point about the\r\nSire de Luxembourg's speech is the condition on which he says he will\r\nransom the Maid. He asks her to promise never again to fight against\r\nEngland and Burgundy. From these words it would seem to have been his\r\nintention to sell her to the King of France or to his representative.[2147]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2147: Morosini, vol. iii, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, however, of this speech having made any\r\nimpression on the English. Jeanne set no store by it.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name, you do but jest,\" she replied; \"for I know well that\r\nit lieth neither within your will nor within your power.\"\r\n\r\nIt is related that when he persisted in his statement, she replied:\r\n\r\n\"I know that these English will put me to death, believing that\r\nafterwards they will conquer France.\"\r\n\r\nSince she certainly did not believe it, it seems highly improbable\r\nthat she should have said that the English would have put her to\r\ndeath. Throughout the trial she was expecting, on the faith of her\r\nVoices, to be delivered. She knew not how or when that deliverance\r\nwould come to pass, but she was as certain of it as of the presence of\r\nOur Lord in the Holy Sacrament. She may have said to the Sire de\r\nLuxembourg: \"I know that the English want to put me to death.\" Then\r\nshe repeated courageously what she had already said a thousand times:\r\n\r\n\"But were there one hundred thousand _Godons_ more than at present,\r\nthey would not conquer the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, the Earl of Stafford unsheathed his sword and\r\nthe Earl of Warwick had to restrain his hand.[2148] That the English\r\nConstable of France should have raised his sword against a woman in\r\nchains would be incredible, did we not know that about this time this\r\nEarl of Stafford, hearing some one speak well of Jeanne, straightway\r\nwished to transfix him.[2149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2148: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 121, 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2149: _Ibid._, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nIn order that the Bishop and Vidame of Beauvais might exercise\r\njurisdiction at Rouen it was necessary that a concession of territory\r\nshould be granted him. The archiepiscopal see of Rouen was\r\nvacant.[2150] For this concession, therefore, the Bishop of Beauvais\r\napplied to the chapter, with whom he had had misunderstandings.[2151]\r\nThe canons of Rouen lacked neither firmness nor independence; more of\r\nthem were honest than dishonest; some were highly educated,\r\nwell-lettered and even kind-hearted. None of them nourished any ill\r\nwill toward the English. The Regent Bedford himself was a canon of\r\nRouen, as Charles VII was a canon of Puy.[2152] On the 20th of October,\r\nin that same year 1430, the Regent, donning surplice and amice, had\r\ndistributed the dole of bread and wine for the chapter.[2153] The\r\ncanons of Rouen were not prejudiced in favour of the Maid of the\r\nArmagnacs; they agreed to the demand of the Bishop of Beauvais and\r\ngranted him the formal concession of territory.[2154]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2150: C. de Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur le proces de\r\ncondamnation de Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Precis des travaux de l'Academie de\r\nRouen_, 1867-1868, pp. 470-479.

De\r\nBeaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, p. 46.]\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of January, 1431, by royal decree, King Henry ordered the\r\nMaid to be given up to the Bishop and Count of Beauvais, reserving to\r\nhimself the right to bring her before him, if she should be acquitted\r\nby the ecclesiastical tribunal.[2155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2155: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 18, 19.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless she was not placed in the Church prison, in one of those\r\ndungeons near the Booksellers' Porch, where in the shadow of the\r\ngigantic cathedral there rotted unhappy wretches who had erred in\r\nmatters of faith.[2156] There she would have endured sufferings far\r\nmore terrible than even the horrors of her military tower. The wrong\r\nthe Great Council of England inflicted on Jeanne by not handing her\r\nover to the ecclesiastical powers of Rouen was far less than the\r\nindignity they thereby inflicted on her judges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2156: A. Sarrazin, _Jeanne d'Arc et la Normandie_, pp. 1771,\r\n1778.]\r\n\r\nWith the way thus opened before him, the Bishop of Beauvais proceeded\r\nwith all the violence one might expect from a Cabochien, albeit that\r\nviolence was qualified by worldly arts and canonical knowledge.[2157]\r\nAs promoter in the case, that is, as the magistrate who was to conduct\r\nthe prosecution, he selected one Jean d'Estivet, called Benedicite,\r\ncanon of Bayeux and of Beauvais, Promoter-General of the diocese of\r\nBeauvais. Jean d'Estivet was a friend of the Lord Bishop, and had been\r\ndriven out of the diocese by the French at the same time. He was\r\nsuspected of hostility to the Maid.[2158] The Lord Bishop appointed\r\nJean de la Fontaine, master of arts, licentiate of canon law, to be\r\n\"councillor commissary\" of the trial.[2159] One of the clerks of the\r\necclesiastical court of Rouen, Guillaume Manchon, priest, he appointed\r\nfirst registrar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2157: J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, p. 147. De\r\nBeaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2158: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 24; vol. iii, p. 162. De\r\nBeaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, p. 26. A. Sarrazin, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\net la Normandie_, p. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2159: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of instructing this official as to what would be\r\nexpected of him, the Lord Bishop said to Messire Guillaume:\r\n\r\n\"You must do the King good service. It is our intention to institute\r\nan elaborate prosecution (_un beau proces_) against this Jeanne.\"[2160]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2160: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 25; vol. iii, p. 137. A. Sarrazin,\r\n_loc. cit._, pp. 221, 222.]\r\n\r\nAs to the King's service, the Lord Bishop did not mean that it should\r\nbe rendered at the expense of justice; he was a man of some priestly\r\npride and was not likely to reveal his own evil designs. If he spoke\r\nthus, it was because in France, for a century at least, the\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition had been regarded as the jurisdiction\r\nof the King.[2161] And as for the expression \"an elaborate prosecution\"\r\n(_un beau proces_), that meant a trial in which legal forms were\r\nobserved and irregularities avoided, for it was a case in which were\r\ninterested the doctors and masters of the realm of France and indeed\r\nthe whole of Christendom. Messire Guillaume Manchon, well skilled in\r\nlegal procedure, was not likely to err in a matter of legal language.\r\nAn elaborate trial was a strictly regular trial. It was said, for\r\nexample, that \"N---- and N---- had by elaborate judicial procedure\r\nfound such an one to be guilty.\"[2162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2161: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition en\r\nFrance_, pp. 550, 551.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2162: De Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur le proces de\r\ncondamnation_, p. 320.]\r\n\r\nCharged by the Bishop to choose another registrar to assist him,\r\nGuillaume Manchon selected as his colleague Guillaume Colles, surnamed\r\nBoisguillaume, who like him was a notary of the Church.[2163]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2163: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 25; vol. iii, p. 137. De\r\nBeaurepaire, _Recherches...._ p. 103. A. Sarrazin, _loc. cit._, pp.\r\n222, 223.]\r\n\r\nJean Massieu, priest, ecclesiastical dean of Rouen, was appointed\r\nusher of the court.[2164]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2164: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 26. De Beaurepaire,\r\n_Recherches...._ p. 115. A. Sarrazin, _loc. cit._, pp. 223, 224.]\r\n\r\nIn that kind of trial, which was very common in those days, there were\r\nstrictly only two judges, the Ordinary and the Inquisitor. But it was\r\nthe custom for the Bishop to summon as councillors and assessors\r\npersons learned in both canon and civil law. The number and the rank\r\nof those councillors varied according to the case. And it is clear\r\nthat the obstinate upholder of a very pestilent heresy must needs be\r\nmore particularly and more ceremoniously tried than an old wife, who\r\nhad sold herself to some insignificant demon, and whose spells could\r\nharm nothing more important than cabbages. For the common wizard, for\r\nthe multitude of those females, or _mulierculae_, as they were\r\ndescribed by one inquisitor who boasted of having burnt many, the\r\njudges were content with three or four ecclesiastical advocates and as\r\nmany canons.[2165] When it was a question of a very notable personage\r\nwho had set a highly pernicious example, of a king's advocate, for\r\ninstance like Master Jean Segueut, who that very year, in Normandy,\r\nhad spoken against the temporal power of the Church, a large assembly\r\nof doctors and prelates, English and French, were convoked, and the\r\ndoctors and masters of the University of Paris were consulted in\r\nwriting.[2166] Now it was fitting that the Maid of the Armagnacs should\r\nbe yet more elaborately and more solemnly tried, with a yet greater\r\nconcourse of doctors and of prelates; and thus it was ordained by the\r\nLord Bishop of Beauvais. As councillors and assessors he summoned the\r\ncanons of Rouen in as great a number as possible. Among those who\r\nanswered his summons we may mention Raoul Roussel, treasurer of the\r\nchapter; Gilles Deschamps, who had been chaplain to the late King, Charles\r\nVI, in 1415; Pierre Maurice, doctor in theology, rector of the University\r\nof Paris in 1428; Jean Alespee, one of the sixteen who during the siege of\r\n1418 had gone robed in black and with cheerful countenance to place at the\r\nfeet of King Henry V the life and honour of the city; Pasquier de Vaux,\r\napostolic notary at the Council of Constance, President of the Norman\r\n_Chambre des Comptes_; Nicolas de Venderes, whose candidature for the\r\nvacant see of Rouen was being advocated by a powerful party; and, lastly,\r\nNicolas Loiseleur. For the same purpose, the Lord Bishop summoned the\r\nabbots of the great Norman abbeys, Mont Saint-Michel-au-Peril-de-la-Mer,\r\nFecamp, Jumieges, Preaux, Mortemer, Saint-Georges de Boscherville, la\r\nTrinite-du-mont-Sainte-Catherine, Saint-Ouen, Bec, Cormeilles, the\r\npriors of Saint-Lo, of Rouen, of Sigy, of Longueville, and the abbot\r\nof Saint Corneille of Compiegne. He summoned twelve ecclesiastical\r\nadvocates; likewise famous doctors and masters of the University of\r\nParis, Jean Beaupere, rector in 1412; Thomas Fiefve, rector in 1427;\r\nGuillaume Erart, Nicolas Midi,[2167] and that young doctor, abounding\r\nin knowledge and in modesty, the brightest star in the Christian\r\nfirmament of the day, Thomas de Courcelles.[2168] The Lord Bishop is\r\nbent upon turning the tribunal, which is to try Jeanne, into a\r\nveritable synod; it is indeed a provincial council, before which she\r\nis cited. Moreover, in effect, it is not only Jeanne the Maid, but\r\nCharles of Valois, calling himself King of France, and lawful\r\nsuccessor of Charles VI who is to be brought to justice. Wherefore are\r\nassembled so many croziered and mitred abbots, so many renowned\r\ndoctors and masters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2165: Eymeric, _Directorium Inquisitorium_, quest. 85.

Sarrazin,\r\n_loc. cit._, pp. 226, 227.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were other bright and shining lights of the\r\nChurch, whom the Bishop of Beauvais neglected to summon. He consulted\r\nthe two bishops of Coutances and Lisieux; he did not consult the\r\nsenior bishop of Normandy, the Bishop of Avranches, Messire Jean de\r\nSaint-Avit, whom the chapter of the cathedral had charged with the\r\nduty of ordination throughout the diocese during the vacancy of the\r\nsee of Rouen. But Messire Jean de Saint-Avit was considered and\r\nrightly considered to favour King Charles.[2169] On the other hand\r\nthose English doctors and masters, residing at Rouen, who had been\r\nconsulted in Segueut's trial, were not consulted in that of\r\nJeanne.[2170] The doctors and masters of the University of Paris, the\r\nabbots of Normandy, the chapter of Rouen, held firmly to the Treaty of\r\nTroyes; they were as prejudiced as the English clerks against the Maid\r\nand the Dauphin Charles, and they were less suspected; it was all to\r\nthe good.[2171]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2169: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 5, 6. De Beaurepaire, _Notes_,\r\npp. 121-125. A. Sarrazin, _loc. cit._, pp. 308-310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2170: De Beaurepaire, _Recherches_, pp. 321 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2171: J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 9th of January, my Lord of Beauvais summoned eight\r\ncouncillors to his house: the abbots of Fecamp and of Jumieges, the\r\nprior of Longueville, the canons Roussel, Venderes, Barbier,\r\nCoppequesne and Loiseleur.\r\n\r\n\"Before entering upon the prosecution of this woman,\" he said to them,\r\n\"we have judged it good, maturely and fully to confer with men learned\r\nand skilled in law, human and divine, of whom, thank God, there be\r\ngreat number in this city of Rouen.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the doctors and masters was that information should be\r\ncollected concerning the deeds and sayings publicly imputed to this\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop informed them that already certain information had\r\nbeen obtained by his command, and that he had decided to order more to\r\nbe collected, which would be ultimately presented to the Council.[2172]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2172: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 5-8.]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that a tabellion[2173] of Andelot in Champagne, Nicolas\r\nBailly, requisitioned by Messire Jean de Torcenay, Bailie of Chaumont\r\nfor King Henry, went to Domremy, and with Gerard Petit, provost of\r\nAndelot, and divers mendicant monks, made inquiry touching Jeanne's\r\nlife and reputation. The interrogators heard twelve or fifteen\r\nwitnesses and among others Jean Hannequin[2174] of Greux and Jean\r\nBegot, with whom they lodged.[2175] We know from Nicolas Bailly himself\r\nthat they gathered not a single fact derogatory to Jeanne. And if we\r\nmay believe Jean Moreau, a citizen of Rouen, Maitre Nicolas, having\r\nbrought my Lord of Beauvais the result of his researches, was treated\r\nas a wicked man and a traitor; and obtained no reward for his\r\nexpenditure or his labour.[2176] This is possible, but it seems\r\nstrange. It can in no wise be true, however, that neither at\r\nVaucouleurs nor at Domremy, nor in the neighbouring villages was\r\nanything discovered against Jeanne. Quite on the contrary, numbers of\r\naccusations were collected against the inhabitants in general, who\r\nwere addicted to evil practices, and in particular against Jeanne, who\r\nheld intercourse with fairies,[2177] carried a mandrake in her bosom,\r\nand disobeyed her father and mother.[2178]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2173: A notary or secretary in France under the old monarchy\r\n(W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2174: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 463.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2175: _Ibid._, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2176: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 192, 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2177: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 105, 146, 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2178: _Ibid._, pp. 208, 209, 213.]\r\n\r\nAbundant information was forthcoming, not only from Lorraine and from\r\nParis, but from the districts loyal to King Charles, from Lagny,\r\nBeauvais, Reims, and even from so far as Touraine and Berry;[2179]\r\nwhich was information enough to burn ten heretics and twenty witches.\r\nDevilries were discovered which filled the priests with horror: the\r\nfinding of a lost cup and gloves, the exposure of an immoral priest,\r\nthe sword of Saint Catherine, the restoration of a child to life.\r\nThere was also a report of a rash letter concerning the Pope and there\r\nwere many other indications of witchcraft, heresy, and religious\r\nerror.[2180] Such information was not to be included among the\r\ndocuments of the trial.[2181] It was the custom of the Holy Inquisition\r\nto keep secret the evidence and even the names of the witnesses.[2182]\r\nIn this case the Bishop of Beauvais might have pleaded as an excuse\r\nfor so doing the safety of the deponents, who might have suffered had\r\nhe published information gathered in provinces subject to the Dauphin\r\nCharles. Even if their names were concealed, they would be identified\r\nby their evidence. For the purposes of the trial, Jeanne's own\r\nconversation in prison was the best source of information: she spoke\r\nmuch and without any of the reserve which prudence might have\r\ndictated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2179: J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, p. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2180: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 245, 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2181: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 200.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2182: De Beaurepaire, _Recherches_, _loc. cit._ J. Quicherat,\r\n_Apercus nouveaux_, pp. 122-124. L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de\r\nl'inquisition_, pp. 389-395.]\r\n\r\nA painter, whose name is unknown, came to see her in her tower. He\r\nasked her aloud and before her guards what arms she bore, as if he\r\nwished to represent her with her escutcheon. In those days portraits\r\nwere very seldom painted from life, except of persons of very high\r\nrank, and they were generally represented kneeling and with clasped\r\nhands in an attitude of prayer. Though in Flanders and in Burgundy\r\nthere may have been a few portraits bearing no signs of devotion, they\r\nwere very rare. A portrait naturally suggested a person praying to\r\nGod, to the Holy Virgin, or to some saint. Wherefore the idea of\r\npainting the Maid's picture doubtless must have met with the stern\r\ndisapproval of her ecclesiastical judges. All the more so because they\r\nmust have feared that the painter would represent this excommunicated\r\nwoman in the guise of a saint, canonised by the Church, as the\r\nArmagnacs were wont to do.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of this incident inclines us to think that\r\nthis man was no painter but a spy. Jeanne told him of the arms which\r\nthe King had granted to her brothers: an azure shield bearing a sword\r\nbetween two golden _fleurs de lis_. And our suspicion is confirmed\r\nwhen at the trial she is reproached with pomp and vanity for having\r\ncaused her arms to be painted.[2183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2183: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 117, 300.]\r\n\r\nSundry clerks introduced into her prison gave her to believe that they\r\nwere men-at-arms of the party of Charles of Valois.[2184] In order to\r\ndeceive her, the Promoter himself, Maitre Jean d'Estivet, disguised\r\nhimself as a poor prisoner.[2185] One of the canons of Rouen, who was\r\nsummoned to the trial, by name Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur, would seem to\r\nhave been especially inventive of devices for the discovery of\r\nJeanne's heresies. A native of Chartres, he was not only a master of\r\narts, but was greatly renowned for astuteness. In 1427 and 1428 he\r\ncarried through difficult negotiations, which detained him long months\r\nin Paris. In 1430 he was one of those deputed by the chapter to go to\r\nthe Cardinal of Winchester in order to obtain an audience of King\r\nHenry and commend to him the church of Rouen. Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur\r\nwas therefore a _persona grata_ with the Great Council.[2186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2184: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2185: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2186: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 72-82. A.\r\nSorel, _loc. cit._, pp. 243, 247.]\r\n\r\nHaving concerted with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick,\r\nhe entered Jeanne's prison, wearing a short jacket like a layman. The\r\nguards had been instructed to withdraw; and Maitre Nicolas, left alone\r\nwith his prisoner, confided to her that he, like herself, was a native\r\nof the Lorraine Marches, a shoemaker by trade, one who held to the\r\nFrench party and had been taken prisoner by the English. From King\r\nCharles he brought her tidings which were the fruit of his own\r\nimagination. No one was dearer to Jeanne than her King. Thus having\r\nwon her confidence, the pseudo-shoemaker asked her sundry questions\r\nconcerning the angels and saints who visited her. She answered him\r\nconfidingly, speaking as friend to friend, as countryman to\r\ncountryman. He gave her counsel, advising her not to believe all these\r\nchurchmen and not to do all that they asked her; \"For,\" he said, \"if\r\nthou believest in them thou shalt be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nMany a time, we are told, did Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur act the part of\r\nthe Lorraine shoemaker. Afterwards he dictated to the registrars all\r\nthat Jeanne had said, providing thus a valuable source of information\r\nof which a memorandum was made to be used during the examination. It\r\nwould even appear that during certain of these visits the registrars\r\nwere stationed at a peep-hole in an adjoining room.[2187] If we may\r\nbelieve the rumours current in the town, Maitre Nicolas also disguised\r\nhimself as Saint Catherine, and by this means brought Jeanne to say\r\nall that he wanted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2187: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 10, 342; vol. iii, pp. 140, 141,\r\n156, 160 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nHe may not have been proud of such deceptions, but at any rate he made\r\nno secret of them.[2188] Many famous masters approved him; others\r\ncensured him.[2189]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2188: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2189: _Ibid._, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nThe angel of the schools, Thomas de Courcelles, when Nicolas told him\r\nof his disguises, counselled him to abandon them.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the registrars pretended that it had been extremely\r\nrepugnant to them thus to overhear in hiding a conversation so\r\ncraftily contrived. The golden age of inquisitorial justice must have\r\nbeen well over when so strict a doctor as Maitre Thomas was willing\r\nthus to criticise the most solemn forms of that justice. Inquisitorial\r\nproceedings must indeed have fallen into decay when two notaries of\r\nthe Church dream of eluding its most common prescriptions. The clerks\r\nwho disguised themselves as soldiers, the Promoter who took on the\r\nsemblance of a poor prisoner, were exercising the most regular\r\nfunctions of the judicial system instituted by Innocent III.\r\n\r\nIn acting the shoemaker and Saint Catherine, if he were seeking the\r\nsalvation and not the destruction of the sinner, if, contrary to\r\npublic report, far from inciting her to rebellion, he was reducing her\r\nto obedience, if, in short, he were but deceiving her for her own\r\ntemporal and spiritual good, Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur was proceeding\r\nin conformity with established rules. In the _Tractatus de Haeresi_ it\r\nis written: \"Let no man approach the heretic, save from time to time\r\ntwo persons of faith and tact, who may warn him with precaution and as\r\nhaving compassion upon him, to eschew death by confessing his errors,\r\nand who may promise him that by so doing he shall escape death by\r\nfire; for the fear of death, and the hope of life may peradventure\r\nsoften a heart which could be touched in no other wise.\"[2190]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2190: _Tractatus de haeresi pauperum de Lugduno_, apud\r\nMartene, _Thesaurus anecd._, vol. v, col. 1787. J. Quicherat, _Apercus\r\nnouveaux_, pp. 131, 132.]\r\n\r\nThe duty of registrars was laid down in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Matters shall be ordained thus, that certain persons shall be\r\nstationed in a suitable place so as to surprise the confidences of\r\nheretics and to overhear their words.\"[2191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2191: Eymeric, _Directorium_, part iii, _Cautelae inquisitorum\r\ncontra haereticorum cavilationes et fraudes_.]\r\n\r\nAs for the Bishop of Beauvais, who had ordained and permitted such\r\nprocedure, he found his justification and approbation in the words of\r\nthe Apostle Saint Paul to the Corinthians: \"I did not burden you:\r\nnevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.\" \"_Ego vos non\r\ngravavi; sed cum essem astutus, dolo vos cepi_\" (II Corinthians xii,\r\n16).[2192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2192: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition en\r\nFrance_, p. 394.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when Jeanne saw the Promoter, Jean d'Estivet, in his\r\nchurchman's habit she did not recognise him. And Maitre Nicolas\r\nLoiseleur also often came to her in monkish dress. In this guise he\r\ninspired her with great confidence; she confessed to him devoutly and\r\nhad no other confessor.[2193] She saw him sometimes as a shoemaker and\r\nsometimes as a canon and never perceived that he was the same person.\r\nWherefore we must indeed believe her to have been incredibly simple in\r\ncertain respects; and these great theologians must have realised that\r\nit was not difficult to deceive her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2193: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 10, 342.]\r\n\r\nIt was well known to all men versed in science, divine and human, that\r\nthe Enemy never entered into dealings with a maid without depriving\r\nher of her virginity.[2194] At Poitiers the French clerks had thought\r\nof it, and when Queen Yolande assured them that Jeanne was a virgin,\r\nthey ceased to fear that she was sent by the devil.[2195] The Lord\r\nBishop of Beauvais in a different hope awaited a similar examination.\r\nThe Duchess of Bedford herself went to the prison. She was assisted by\r\nLady Anna Bavon and another matron. It has been said that the Regent\r\nwas hidden meanwhile in an adjoining room and looking through a hole\r\nin the wall.[2196] This is by no means certain, but it is not\r\nimpossible; he was at Rouen a fortnight after Jeanne had been brought\r\nthere.[2197] Whether the charge were groundless or well founded he was\r\nseriously reproached for this curiosity. If there were many who in his\r\nplace would have been equally curious, every one must judge for\r\nhimself; but we must bear in mind that my Lord of Bedford believed\r\nJeanne a witch, and that it was not the custom in those days to treat\r\nwitches with the respect due to ladies. We must remember also that\r\nthis was a matter in which Old England was greatly concerned, and the\r\nRegent loved his country with all his heart and all his strength.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2194: Vallet de Viriville, _Nouvelles recherches sur Agnes\r\nSorel_, pp. 33 _et seq._ Du Cange, _Glossaire_, at the word\r\n_Matrimonium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2195: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 102, 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2196: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 155, 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2197: A. Sarrazin, _Jeanne d'Arc et la Normandie_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nUpon the examination of the Duchess of Bedford as upon that of the\r\nQueen of Sicily Jeanne appeared a virgin. The matrons knew various\r\nsigns of virginity; but for us a more certain sign is Jeanne's own\r\nword. When she was asked wherefore she called herself the Maid,\r\nwhether she were one in reality, she replied: \"I may tell you that\r\nsuch I am.\"[2198] The judges, as far as we know, set no store by this\r\nfavourable result of the examination. Did they believe with the wise\r\nKing Solomon that in such matters all inquiry is vain, and did they\r\nreject the matrons' verdict by virtue of the saying: _Virginitatis\r\nprobatio non minus difficilis quam custodia_? No, they knew well that\r\nshe was indeed a virgin. They allowed it to be understood when they\r\ndid not assert the contrary.[2199] And since they persisted in\r\nbelieving her a witch, it must have been because they imagined her to\r\nhave given herself to devils who had left her as they found her. The\r\nmorals of devils abounded in such inconsistencies, which were the\r\ndespair of the most learned doctors; every day new inconsistencies\r\nwere being discovered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2198: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2199: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 217, 218.]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 13th of January, the Lord Abbot of Fecamp, the\r\ndoctors and masters, Nicolas de Venderes, Guillaume Haiton, Nicolas\r\nCoppequesne, Jean de la Fontaine, and Nicolas Loiseleur, met in the\r\nhouse of the Lord Bishop. There was read to them the information\r\nconcerning the Maid gathered in Lorraine and elsewhere. And it was\r\ndecided that according to this information a certain number of\r\narticles should be drawn up in due form; which was done.[2200]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2200: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 27, 28.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 23rd of January, the doctors and masters above named\r\nconsidered the terms of these articles, and, finding them sufficient,\r\nthey decided that they might be used for the examination. Then they\r\nresolved that the Bishop of Beauvais should order a preliminary\r\ninquiry as to the deeds and sayings of Jeanne.[2201]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2201: _Ibid._, pp. 28, 29.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 13th of February, Jean d'Estivet, called Benedicite,\r\nPromoter, Jean de la Fontaine, Commissioner, Boisguillaume and\r\nManchon, Registrars, and Jean Massieu, Usher, took the oath faithfully\r\nto discharge their various offices. Then straightway Maitre Jean de la\r\nFontaine, assisted by two registrars, proceeded to the preliminary\r\ninquiry.[2202]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2202: _Ibid._, pp. 29, 31.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 19th of February, at eight o'clock in the morning, the\r\ndoctors and masters assembled, to the number of eleven, in the house\r\nof the Bishop of Beauvais; there they heard the reading of the\r\narticles and the preliminary information. Whereupon they gave it as\r\ntheir opinion, and, in conformity with this opinion, the Bishop\r\ndecided that there was matter sufficient to justify the woman called\r\nthe Maid being cited and charged touching a question of faith.[2203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2203: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 31-33.]\r\n\r\nBut now a fresh difficulty arose. In such a trial it was necessary for\r\nthe accused to appear at once before the Ordinary and before the\r\nInquisitor. The two judges were equally necessary for the validity of\r\nthe trial. Now the Grand Inquisitor for the realm of France, Brother\r\nJean Graverent, was then at Saint-Lo, prosecuting on a religious\r\ncharge a citizen of the town, one Jean Le Couvreur.[2204] In the\r\nabsence of Brother Jean Graverent, the Bishop of Beauvais had invited\r\nthe Vice-Inquisitor for the diocese of Rouen to proceed against Jeanne\r\nconjointly with himself. Meanwhile the Vice-Inquisitor seemed not to\r\nunderstand; he made no response; and the Bishop was left in\r\nembarrassment with his lawsuit on his hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2204: _Ibid._, p. 32. J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, p.\r\n102. De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 24-27. Le P. Chapotin,\r\n_La guerre de cent ans, Jeanne d'Arc et les dominicains_, pp. 141-143.\r\nA. Sarrazin, _P. Cauchon_, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nThis Vice-Inquisitor was Brother Jean Lemaistre, Prior of the\r\nDominicans of Rouen, bachelor of theology, a monk right prudent and\r\nscrupulous.[2205] At length in answer to a summons from the Usher, at\r\nfour o'clock on the 19th of February, 1413, he appeared in the house\r\nof the Bishop of Beauvais. He declared himself ready to intervene\r\nprovided that he had the right to do so, which he doubted. As the\r\nreason for his uncertainty he alleged that he was the Inquisitor of\r\nRouen; now the Bishop of Beauvais was exercising his jurisdiction as\r\nbishop of the diocese of Beauvais, but on borrowed territory;\r\nwherefore was it not rather for the Inquisitor of Beauvais not for the\r\nInquisitor of Rouen, to sit on the judgment seat side by side with the\r\nBishop?[2206] He declared that he would ask the Grand Inquisitor of\r\nFrance for an authorisation which should hold good for the diocese of\r\nBeauvais. Meanwhile he consented to act in order to satisfy his own\r\nconscience and to prevent the proceedings from lapsing, which, in the\r\nopinion of all, must have ensued had the trial been instituted without\r\nthe concurrence of the Holy Inquisition.[2207] All preliminary\r\ndifficulties were now removed. The Maid was cited to appear on\r\nWednesday, the 21st of February,[2208] 1431.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2205: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2206: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 35.

Fifteen of them were doctors in\r\ntheology, five doctors in civil and canon law, six bachelors in\r\ntheology, eleven bachelors in canon law, four licentiates in civil\r\nlaw. The Bishop sat as judge. At his side were the Councillors and\r\nAssessors, clothed either in the fine camlet of canons or in the\r\ncoarse cloth of mendicants, expressive, the one of sacerdotal\r\nsolemnity, the other of evangelical meekness. Some glared fiercely,\r\nothers cast down their eyes. Brother Jean Lemaistre, Vice-Inquisitor\r\nof the faith, was among them, silent, in the black and white livery of\r\npoverty and obedience.[2209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2209: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 38, 39.]\r\n\r\nBefore bringing in the accused, the usher informed the Bishop that\r\nJeanne, to whom the citation had been delivered, had replied that she\r\nwould be willing to appear, but she demanded that an equal number of\r\necclesiastics of the French party should be added to those of the\r\nEnglish party. She requested also the permission to hear mass.[2210]\r\nThe Bishop refused both demands;[2211] and Jeanne was brought in,\r\ndressed as a man, with her feet in shackles. She was made to sit down\r\nat the table of the registrars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2210: _Ibid._, pp. 42-43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2211: _Ibid._, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nAnd now from the very outset these theologians and this damsel\r\nregarded each other with mutual horror and hatred. Contrary to the\r\ncustom of her sex, a custom which even loose women did not dare to\r\ninfringe, she displayed her hair, which was brown and cut short over\r\nthe ears. It was possibly the first time that some of those young\r\nmonks seated behind their elders had ever seen a woman's hair. She\r\nwore hose like a youth. To them her dress appeared immodest and\r\nabominable.[2212] She exasperated and irritated them. Had the Bishop of\r\nBeauvais insisted on her appearing in hood and gown their anger\r\nagainst her would have been less violent. This man's attire brought\r\nbefore their minds the works performed by the Maid in the camp of the\r\nDauphin Charles, calling himself king. By the stroke of a magic wand\r\nshe had deprived the English men-at-arms of all their strength, and\r\nthereby she had inflicted sore hurt on the majority of the churchmen\r\nwho were to judge her. Some among them were thinking of the benefices\r\nof which she had despoiled them; others, doctors and masters of the\r\nUniversity, recalled how she had been about to lay Paris waste with\r\nfire and sword;[2213] others again, canons and abbots, could not\r\nforgive her perchance for having struck fear into their hearts even in\r\nremote Normandy. Was it possible for them to pardon the havoc she had\r\nthus wrought in a great part of the Church of France, when they knew\r\nshe had done it by sorcery, by divination and by invoking devils? \"A\r\nman must be very ignorant if he will deny the reality of magic,\" said\r\nSprenger. As they were very learned, they saw magicians and wizards\r\nwhere others would never have suspected them; they held that to doubt\r\nthe power of demons over men and things was not only heretical and\r\nimpious, but tending to subvert the whole natural and social order.\r\nThese doctors, seated in the castle chapel, had burned each one of\r\nthem ten, twenty, fifty witches, all of whom had confessed their\r\ncrimes. Would it not have been madness after that to doubt the\r\nexistence of witches?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2212: _Ibid._, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2213: Le P. Denifle and Chatelain, _Le proces de Jeanne d'Arc\r\net l'Universite de Paris_.]\r\n\r\nTo us it seems curious that beings capable of causing hail-storms and\r\ncasting spells over men and animals should allow themselves to be\r\ntaken, judged, tortured, and burned without making any defence; but it\r\nwas constantly occurring; every ecclesiastical judge must have\r\nobserved it. Very learned men were able to account for it: they\r\nexplained that wizards and witches lost their power as soon as they\r\nfell into the hands of churchmen. This explanation was deemed\r\nsufficient. The hapless Maid had lost her power like the others; they\r\nfeared her no longer.\r\n\r\nAt least Jeanne hated them as bitterly as they hated her. It was\r\nnatural for unlettered saints, for the fair inspired, frank of mind,\r\ncapricious, and enthusiastic to feel an antipathy towards doctors all\r\ninflated with knowledge and stiffened with scholasticism. Such an\r\nantipathy Jeanne had recently felt towards clerks, even when as at\r\nPoitiers they had been on the French side, and had not wished her evil\r\nand had not greatly troubled her. Wherefore we may easily imagine how\r\nintense was the repulsion with which the clerks of Rouen now inspired\r\nher. She knew that they sought to compass her death. But she feared\r\nthem not; confidently she awaited from her saints and angels the\r\nfulfilment of their promise, their coming for her deliverance. She\r\nknew not when nor how her deliverance should come; but that come it\r\nwould she never once doubted. To doubt it would indeed have been to\r\ndoubt Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and even Our Lord; it would have\r\nbeen to believe evil of her Voices. They had told her to fear nothing,\r\nand of nothing was she afeard.[2214] Fearless simplicity; whence came\r\nher confidence in her Voices if not from her own heart?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2214: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 88, 94, 151, 155, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop required her to swear, according to the prescribed form\r\nwith both hands on the holy Gospels, that she would reply truly to all\r\nthat should be asked her.\r\n\r\nShe could not. Her Voices forbade her telling any one of the\r\nrevelations they had so abundantly vouchsafed to her.\r\n\r\nShe answered: \"I do not know on what you wish to question me. You\r\nmight ask me things that I would not tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the Bishop insisted on her swearing to tell the whole truth:\r\n\r\n\"Touching my father and mother and what I did after my coming into\r\nFrance I will willingly swear,\" she said; \"but touching God's\r\nrevelations to me, those I have neither told nor communicated to any\r\nman, save to Charles my King. And nought of them will I reveal, were I\r\nto lose my head for it.\"\r\n\r\nThen, either because she wished to gain time or because she counted on\r\nreceiving some new directions from her _Council_, she added that in a\r\nweek she would know whether she might so reveal those things.\r\n\r\nAt length she took the oath, according to the prescribed form, on her\r\nknees, with both hands on the missal.[2215] Then she answered\r\nconcerning her name, her country, her parents, her baptism, her\r\ngodfathers and godmothers. She said that to the best of her knowledge\r\nshe was about nineteen years of age.[2216]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2215: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2216: _Ibid._, p. 46.]\r\n\r\nQuestioned concerning her education, she replied: \"From my mother I\r\nlearnt my Paternoster, my Ave Maria and my Credo.\"\r\n\r\nBut, asked to repeat her Paternoster, she refused, for, she said, she\r\nwould only say it in confession. This was because she wanted the\r\nBishop to hear her confess.[2217]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2217: _Ibid._, pp. 46-47.]\r\n\r\nThe assembly was profoundly agitated; all spoke at once. Jeanne with\r\nher soft voice had scandalised the doctors.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop forbade her to leave her prison, under pain of being\r\nconvicted of the crime of heresy.\r\n\r\nShe refused to submit to this prohibition. \"If I did escape,\" she\r\nsaid, \"none could reproach me with having broken faith, for I never\r\ngave my word to any one.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards she complained of her chains.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop told her they were on account of her attempt to escape.\r\n\r\nShe agreed: \"It is true that I wanted to escape, and I still want to,\r\njust like every other prisoner.\"[2218]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2218: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 47.]\r\n\r\nSuch a confession was very bold, if she had rightly understood the\r\njudge when he said that by flight from prison she would incur the\r\npunishment of a heretic. To escape from an ecclesiastical prison was\r\nto commit a crime against the Church, but it was folly as well as\r\ncrime; for the prisons of the Church are penitentiaries, and the\r\nprisoner who refuses salutary penance is as foolish as he is guilty;\r\nfor he is like a sick man who refuses to be cured. But Jeanne was not,\r\nstrictly speaking, in an ecclesiastical prison; she was in the castle\r\nof Rouen, a prisoner of war in the hands of the English. Could it be\r\nsaid that if she escaped she would incur excommunication and the\r\nspiritual and temporal penalties inflicted on the enemies of religion?\r\nThere lay the difficulty. The Lord Bishop removed it forthwith by an\r\nelaborate legal fiction. Three English men-at-arms, John Grey, John\r\nBerwoist, and William Talbot, were appointed by the King to be\r\nJeanne's custodians. The Bishop, acting as an ecclesiastical judge,\r\nhimself delivered to them their charge, and made them swear on the\r\nholy Gospels to bind the damsel and confine her.[2219] In this wise\r\nthe Maid became the prisoner of our holy Mother, the Church; and she\r\ncould not burst her bonds without falling into heresy. The second\r\nsitting was appointed for the next day, the 22nd of February.[2220]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2219: _Ibid._, pp. 47, 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2220: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 48.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL FOR LAPSE (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a record of the proceedings came to be written down after the\r\nfirst sitting, a dispute arose between the ecclesiastical notaries and\r\nthe two or three royal registrars who had likewise taken down the\r\nreplies of the accused. As might be expected, the two records differed\r\nin several places. It was decided that on the contested points Jeanne\r\nshould be further examined.[2221] The notaries of the Church complained\r\nalso that they experienced great difficulty in seizing Jeanne's words\r\non account of the constant interruptions of the bystanders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2221: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 131-136.]\r\n\r\nIn a trial by the Inquisition there was no place fixed for the\r\nexamination any more than for the other acts of the procedure. The\r\njudges might examine the accused in a chapel, in a chapter-house, or\r\neven in a prison or a torture-chamber. According to Messire Guillaume\r\nManchon it was in order to escape from the tumult of the first\r\nsitting,[2222] and because there was no longer any reason for\r\nproceeding with such solemn ceremony as at the opening of the trial,\r\nthat the judge and his councillors met in the Robing Room, a little\r\nchamber at one end of the castle hall;[2223] and two English guards\r\nwere stationed at the door. According to the rules of inquisitorial\r\nprocedure, the assessors were not bound to be present at all the\r\ndeliberations.[2224] This time forty-two were present, twenty-six of\r\nthe original ones and six newly appointed. Among these high clerics\r\nwas Brother Jean Lemaistre, Vice Inquisitor of the Faith, a humble\r\npreaching friar. No longer as in the days of Saint Dominic was the\r\nVice Inquisitor the hunting hound of the Lord, now he was but the dog\r\nof the Bishop, a poor monk, who dared neither to do nor to abstain\r\nfrom doing. Such was the result of the assertion of Gallican\r\nindependence against papal supremacy. Dumb and timid, Brother Jean\r\nLemaistre was the last and the least of all the brethren in that\r\nassembly, but he was ever looking for the day when he should be\r\nsovereign judge and without appeal.[2225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2222: _Ibid._, p. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2223: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 48. A. Sarrazin, _Jeanne d'Arc et\r\nla Normandie_, pp. 323, 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2224: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition_, p.\r\n420.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2225: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 48-50.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was brought in by the Usher, Messire Jean Massieu. Again she\r\nendeavoured to avoid taking the oath to tell everything; but she had\r\nto swear on the Gospel.[2226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2226: _Ibid._, p. 50.]\r\n\r\nShe was examined by Maitre Jean Beaupere, doctor in theology. In his\r\nUniversity of Paris he was regarded as a scholar of light and leading;\r\nit had twice appointed him rector. It had charged him with the\r\nfunctions of chancellor in the absence of Gerson, and, in 1419, had\r\nsent him with Messire Pierre Cauchon to the town of Troyes, to give\r\naid and counsel to King Charles VI. Three years later it had\r\ndespatched him to the Queen of England and the Duke of Gloucester to\r\nenlist their support in its endeavour to obtain the confirmation of\r\nits privileges. King Henry VI had just appointed him canon of\r\nRouen.[2227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2227: Du Boulay, _Historia Universitatis Paris._, vol. v, p.\r\n919. De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 27-30.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean's first question to Jeanne was what was her age when she\r\nleft her father's house. She was unable to say, although on the\r\nprevious day she had stated her present age to be about nineteen.[2228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2228: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nInterrogated as to the occupations of her childhood, she replied that\r\nshe was busy with household duties and seldom went into the fields\r\nwith the cattle.\r\n\r\n\"For spinning and sewing,\" she said, \"I am as good as any woman in\r\nRouen.\"[2229]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2229: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThus even in things domestic she displayed her ardour and her\r\nchivalrous zeal; at the spinning-wheel and with the needle she\r\nchallenged all the women in a town, without knowing one of them.\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to her confessions and her communions, she answered that\r\nshe confessed to her parish priest or to another priest when the\r\nformer was not able to hear her. But she refused to say whether she\r\nhad received the communion on other feast-days than Easter.[2230]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2230: _Ibid._, pp. 51, 52.]\r\n\r\nIn order to take her unawares, Maitre Jean Beaupere proceeded without\r\nmethod, passing abruptly from one subject to another. Suddenly he\r\nspoke of her Voices. She gave him the following reply:\r\n\r\n\"Being thirteen years of age, I heard the Voice of God, bidding me\r\nlead a good life. And the first time I was sore afeard. And the Voice\r\ncame almost at the hour of noon, in summer, in my father's garden....\"\r\n\r\nShe heard the Voice on the right towards the church. Rarely did she\r\nhear it without seeing a light. This light was in the direction whence\r\nthe Voice came.[2231]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2231: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52.]\r\n\r\nWhen Jeanne said that her Voice spoke to her from the right, a doctor\r\nmore learned and more kindly disposed than Maitre Jean would have\r\ninterpreted this circumstance favourably; for do we not read in\r\nEzekiel that the angels were upon the right hand of the dwelling; do\r\nwe not find in the last chapter of Saint Mark, that the women beheld\r\nthe Angel seated on the right, and finally does not Saint Luke\r\nexpressly state that the Angel appeared unto Zacharias on the right of\r\nthe altar burning with incense; whereupon the Venerable Bede observes:\r\n\"he appeared on the right as a sign that he was the bringer of divine\r\nmercy.\"[2232] But such things never occurred to the examiner. Thinking\r\nto embarrass Jeanne, he asked how she came to see the light if it\r\nappeared at her side.[2233] Jeanne made no reply, and as if distraught,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\"If I were in a wood I should easily hear the Voices coming towards\r\nme.... It seems to me to be a Voice right worthy. I believe that this\r\nVoice was sent to me by God. After having heard it three times I knew\r\nit to be the voice of an angel.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2232: Brehal, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, ed. Lanery d'Arc, p. 409.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2233: See Appendix I, Letter from Doctor G. Dumas.]\r\n\r\n\"What instruction did this Voice give you for the salvation of your\r\nsoul?\"\r\n\r\n\"It taught me to live well, to go to church, and it told me to fare\r\nforth into France.\"[2234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2234: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52.]\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne related how, by the command of her Voice, she had gone to\r\nVaucouleurs, to Sire Robert de Baudricourt, whom she had recognised\r\nwithout ever having seen him before, how the Duke of Lorraine had\r\nsummoned her to cure him, and how she had come into France.[2235]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2235: _Ibid._, pp. 53, 54.]\r\n\r\nThereafter she was brought to say that she knew well that God loved\r\nthe Duke of Orleans and that concerning him she had had more\r\nrevelations than concerning any man living, save the King; that she\r\nhad been obliged to change her woman's dress for man's attire and that\r\nher _Council_ had advised her well.[2236]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2236: _Ibid._, p. 54.]\r\n\r\nThe letter to the English was read before her. She admitted having\r\ndictated it in those terms, with the exception of three passages. She\r\nhad not said _body for body_ nor _chieftain of war_; and she had said\r\n_surrender to the King_ in the place _of surrender to the Maid_. That\r\nthe judges had not tampered with the text of the letter we may assure\r\nourselves by comparing it with other texts, which did not pass through\r\ntheir hands, and which contain the expressions challenged by\r\nJeanne.[2237]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2237: _Ibid._, pp. 55, 56; vol. v, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of her career, she believed that Our Lord, the true\r\nKing of France, had ordained her to deliver the government of the\r\nrealm to Charles of Valois, as His deputy. The words in which she gave\r\nutterance to this idea are reported by too many persons strangers one\r\nto another for us to doubt her having spoken them. \"The King shall\r\nhold the kingdom as a fief (_en commande_); the King of France is the\r\nlieutenant of the King of Heaven.\" These are her own words and she did\r\nactually say to the Dauphin: \"Make a gift of your realm to the King of\r\nHeaven.\"[2238] But we are bound to admit that at Rouen not one of these\r\nmystic ideas persists, indeed there they seem altogether beyond her.\r\nIn all her replies to her examiners, she seems incapable of any\r\nabstract reasoning whatsoever and of any speculation however simple,\r\nso that it is hard to understand how she should ever have conceived\r\nthe idea of the temporal rule of Jesus Christ over the Land of the\r\nLilies. There is nothing in her speech or in her thoughts to suggest\r\nsuch meditations, wherefore we are led to believe that this\r\npolitico-theology had been taught her in her tender, teachable years\r\nby ecclesiastics desiring to remove the woes of Church and kingdom,\r\nbut that she had failed to seize its spirit or grasp its inner\r\nmeaning. Now, in the midst of a hard life lived with men-at-arms,\r\nwhose simple souls accorded better with her own than the more\r\ncultivated minds of the early directors of her meditations, she had\r\nforgotten even the phraseology in which those suggested meditations\r\nwere expressed. Interrogated concerning her coming to Chinon, she\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Without let or hindrance I went to my King. When I reached the town\r\nof Sainte-Catherine de Fierbois, I sent first to the town of\r\nChateau-Chinon, where my King was. I arrived there about the hour of\r\nnoon and lodged in an inn, and, after dinner, I went to my King who\r\nwas in his castle.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2238: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 456; vol. iii, pp. 91, 92.\r\nMorosini, vol. iii, p. 104. Eberhard Windecke, pp. 152, 153. J.\r\nQuicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, pp. 131-133. Le P. Ayroles, _La vraie\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, vol. iv, p. 440, ch. i, _La royaute de Jesus Christ_.]\r\n\r\nIf we may believe the registrars, they never ceased wondering at her\r\nmemory. They were amazed that she should recollect exactly what she\r\nhad said a week before.[2239] Nevertheless her memory was sometimes\r\ncuriously uncertain, and we have reason for thinking with the Bastard\r\nthat she waited two days at the inn before being received by the\r\nKing.[2240]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2239: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 89, 142, 161, 176, 178, 201.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2240: _Ibid._, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to this audience in the castle of Chinon, she told her\r\njudges she had recognised the King as she had recognised the Sire de\r\nBaudricourt, by revelation.[2241]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2241: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nThe interrogator asked her: \"When the Voice revealed your King to you,\r\nwas there any light?\"[2242]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2242: _Ibid._, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nThis question bore upon matters which were of great moment to her\r\njudges; for they suspected the Maid of having committed a sacrilegious\r\nfraud, or rather witchcraft, with the complicity of the King of\r\nFrance. Indeed, they had learnt from their informers that Jeanne\r\nboasted of having given the King a sign in the form of a precious\r\ncrown.[2243] The following is the actual truth of the matter:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2243: We find it impossible to agree with Quicherat (_Apercus\r\nnouveaux_) and admit that Jeanne gradually invented the fable of the\r\ncrown during her examination and while her judges were questioning her\r\nas to \"the sign.\" The manner in which the judges conducted this part\r\nof their examination proves that they were acquainted with the whole\r\nof the extraordinary story.]\r\n\r\nThe legend of Saint Catherine relates that on a day she received from\r\nthe hand of an angel a resplendent crown and placed it on the head of\r\nthe Empress of the Romans. This crown was the symbol of eternal\r\nblessedness.[2244] Jeanne, who had been brought up on this legend,\r\nsaid that the same thing had happened to her. In France she had told\r\nsundry marvellous stories of crowns, and in one of these stories she\r\nimagined herself to be in the great hall of the castle at Chinon, in\r\nthe midst of the barons, receiving a crown from the hand of an angel\r\nto give it to her King.[2245] This was true in a spiritual sense, for\r\nshe had taken Charles to his anointing and to his coronation. Jeanne\r\nwas not quick to grasp the distinction between two kinds of truth. She\r\nmay, nevertheless, have doubted the material reality of this vision.\r\nShe may even have held it to be true in a spiritual sense only. In any\r\ncase, she had of her own accord promised Saint Catherine and Saint\r\nMargaret not to speak of it to her judges.[2246]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2244: _Legenda Aurea_, ed. 1846, pp. 789 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2245: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 120-122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2246: _Ibid._, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n\"Saw you any angel above the King?\"\r\n\r\nShe refused to reply.[2247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2247: _Ibid._, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nThis time nothing more was said of the crown. Maitre Jean Beaupere\r\nasked Jeanne if she often heard the Voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not a day passes without my hearing it. And it is my stay in great\r\nneed.\"[2248]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2248: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nShe never spoke of her Voices without describing them as her refuge\r\nand relief, her consolation and her joy. Now all theologians agreed in\r\nbelieving that good spirits when they depart leave the soul filled\r\nwith joy, with peace, and with comfort, and as proof they cited the\r\nangel's words to Zacharias and Mary: \"Be not afraid.\"[2249] This\r\nreason, however, was not strong enough to persuade clerks of the\r\nEnglish party that Voices hostile to the English were of God.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2249: Jean Brehal, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, ed. Lanery d'Arc, p. 409.]\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid added: \"Never have I required of them any other final\r\nreward than the salvation of my soul.\"[2250]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2250: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe examination ended with a capital charge: the attack on Paris on a\r\nfeast day. It was in this connection possibly that Brother Jacques of\r\nTouraine, a friar of the Franciscan order, who from time to time put a\r\nquestion, asked Jeanne whether she had ever been in a place where\r\nEnglishmen were being slain.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name, was I ever in such a place?\" Jeanne responded\r\nvehemently. \"How glibly you speak. Why did they not depart from France\r\nand go into their own country?\"\r\n\r\nA nobleman of England, who was in the chamber, on hearing these words,\r\nsaid to his neighbours: \"By my troth she is a good woman. Why is she\r\nnot English?\"[2251]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2251: _Ibid._, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe third public sitting was appointed for two days thence, Saturday,\r\nthe 24th of February.[2252]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2252: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nIt was Lent. Jeanne observed the fast very strictly.[2253]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2253: _Ibid._, pp. 61, 70.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 23rd, in the morning, she was awakened by her Voices\r\nthemselves. She arose from her bed and remained seated, her hands\r\nclasped, giving thanks. Then she asked what she should reply to her\r\njudges, beseeching the Voices thereupon to take counsel of Our Lord.\r\nFirst the Voices uttered words she could not understand. That happened\r\nsometimes, in difficult circumstances especially. Then they\r\nsaid:[2254] \"Reply boldly, God will aid thee.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2254: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 62.]\r\n\r\nThat day she heard them a second time at the hour of vespers and a\r\nthird time when the bells were ringing the _Ave Maria_ in the evening.\r\nIn the night of Friday and Saturday they came and revealed to her many\r\nsecrets for the weal of the King of France. Thereupon she received\r\ngreat consolation.[2255] Very probably they repeated the assurance that\r\nshe would be delivered from the hands of her enemies, and that on the\r\nother hand her judges stood in great danger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2255: _Ibid._, pp. 61-64.]\r\n\r\nShe depended absolutely on her Voices for direction. When she was in\r\ndifficulty as to what to say to her judges, she prayed to Our Lord;\r\nshe addressed him devoutly, saying: \"Good God, for the sake of thy\r\nholy Passion, I beseech thee if thou lovest me to reveal unto me what\r\nI should reply to these churchmen. Touching my dress I know well how I\r\nwas commanded to put it on; but as to leaving it I know nothing. In\r\nthis may it please thee to teach me.\"\r\n\r\nThen straightway the Voices came.[2256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2256: _Ibid._, p. 279.]\r\n\r\nAt the third sitting, held in the Robing Chamber, there were present\r\nsixty-two assessors, of whom twenty were new.[2257]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2257: _Ibid._, pp. 58-60.]\r\n\r\nJeanne showed a greater repugnance than before to swearing on the holy\r\nGospels to reply to all that should be asked her. In charity the\r\nBishop warned her that this obstinate refusal caused her to be\r\nsuspected, and he required her to swear, under pain of being convicted\r\nupon all the charges.[2258] Such was indeed the rule in a trial by the\r\nInquisition. In 1310 a _beguine_, one La Porete, refused to take the\r\noath as required by the Holy Inquisitor of the Faith, Brother\r\nGuillaume of Paris. She was excommunicated forthwith, and without\r\nbeing further examined, after lengthy proceedings, she was handed over\r\nto the Provost of Paris, who caused her to be burned alive. Her piety\r\nat the stake drew tears from all the bystanders.[2259]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2258: _Ibid._, pp. 60, 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2259: _Grandes chroniques_, ed. P. Paris, vol. v, p. 188.]\r\n\r\nStill the Bishop failed to force an unconditional oath from the Maid;\r\nshe swore to tell the truth on all she knew concerning the trial,\r\nreserving to herself the right to be silent on everything which in her\r\nopinion did not concern it. She spoke freely of the Voices she had\r\nheard the previous day, but not of the revelations touching the King.\r\nWhen, however, Maitre Jean Beaupere appeared desirous to know them,\r\nshe asked for a fortnight's delay before replying, sure that before\r\nthen she would be delivered; and straightway she fell to boasting of\r\nthe secrets her Voices had confided to her for the King's weal.\r\n\r\n\"I would wish him to know them at this moment,\" she said; \"even if as\r\nthe result I were to drink no wine from now till Easter.\"[2260]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2260: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n\"Drink no wine from now till Easter!\" Did she thus casually use an\r\nexpression common in that land of the rose-tinted wine (_vin gris_), a\r\ndrop or two of which with a slice of bread sufficed the Domremy women\r\nfor a meal?[2261] Or had she caught this manner of speech with the\r\nhabit of dealing hard clouts and good blows from the men-at-arms of\r\nher company? Alas! what hypocras was she to drink during the five\r\nweeks before Easter! She was merely making use of a current phrase, as\r\nwas frequently her custom, and attributing no precise meaning to it,\r\nunless it were that wine vaguely suggested to her mind the idea of\r\ncordiality and the hope that after her deliverance she would see the\r\nLords of France filling a cup in her honour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2261: E. Hinzelin, _Chez Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 37, 177.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere asked her whether she saw anything when she heard\r\nher Voices.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"I cannot tell you everything. I am not permitted. The\r\nVoice is good and worthy.... To this question I am not bound to\r\nreply.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she asked them to give her in writing the points concerning which\r\nshe had not given an immediate reply.[2262]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2262: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 64, 65.]\r\n\r\nWhat use did she intend to make of this writing? She did not know how\r\nto read; she had no counsel. Did she want to show the document to some\r\nfalse friend, like Loiseleur, who was deceiving her? Or was it her\r\nintent to present it to her saints?\r\n\r\nMaitre Beaupere asked whether her Voice had a face and eyes.\r\n\r\nShe refused to answer and quoted a saying frequently on the lips of\r\nchildren: \"One is often hanged for having spoken the truth.\"[2263]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2263: _Ibid._, p. 65. \"_Souvent on est blame de trop\r\nparler_,\" a proverb common in the 15th century. Cf. Le Roux de Lincy,\r\n_Les proverbes francais_, vol. ii, p. 417.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Beaupere asked: \"Do you know whether you stand in God's grace?\"\r\n\r\nThis was an extremely insidious question; it placed Jeanne in the\r\ndilemma of having to avow herself sinful or of appearing unpardonably\r\nbold. One of the assessors, Maitre Jean Lefevre of the Order of the\r\nHermit Friars, observed that she was not bound to reply. There was\r\nmurmuring throughout the chamber.\r\n\r\nBut Jeanne said: \"If I be not, then may God bring me into it; if I be,\r\nthen may God keep me in it.\"[2264]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2264: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 65.]\r\n\r\nThe assessors were astonished at so ready an answer. And yet no\r\nimprovement ensued in their disposition towards her. They admitted\r\nthat touching her King she spoke well, but for the rest she was too\r\nsubtle, and with a subtlety peculiar to women.[2265]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2265: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 21, 358.]\r\n\r\nThereafter, Maitre Jean Beaupere examined Jeanne concerning her\r\nchildhood in her village. He essayed to show that she had been cruel,\r\nhad displayed a homicidal tendency from her earliest years, and had\r\nbeen addicted to those idolatrous practices which had given the folk\r\nof Domremy a bad name.[2266]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2266: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 65-68.]\r\n\r\nThen he touched on a point of prime importance in elucidating the\r\nobscure origin of Jeanne's mission:\r\n\r\n\"Were you not regarded as the one who was sent from the Oak Wood?\"\r\n\r\nIn this direction he might have succeeded in obtaining important\r\nrevelations. False prophecies had indeed established Jeanne's\r\nreputation in France; but these clerks were incapable of\r\ndiscriminating amongst all these pseudo-Bedes and pseudo-Merlins.[2267]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2267: _Ibid._, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nJeanne replied: \"When I came to the King, certain asked me whether\r\nthere were in my country a wood called the Oak Wood; because of\r\nprophecies saying that from the neighbourhood of this wood should\r\ncome a damsel who would work wonders. But to such things I paid no\r\nheed.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement we must needs believe; but if she denied credence to\r\nthe prophecy of Merlin touching the Virgin of the Oak Wood, she paid\r\ngood heed to the prophecy foretelling the appearance of a Deliverer in\r\nthe person of a Maid coming from the Lorraine Marches, since she\r\nrepeated that prophecy to the two Leroyers and to her Uncle Lassois,\r\nwith an emphasis which filled them with astonishment. Now we must\r\nadmit that the two prophecies are as alike as two peas.[2268]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2268: The French expression runs, \"_se resemblent comme deux\r\nsoeurs_.\"]\r\n\r\nPassing abruptly from Merlin the Magician, Maitre Jean Beaupere asked:\r\n\"Jeanne, will you have a woman's dress?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered: \"Give me one; and I will accept it and depart. Otherwise\r\nI will not have it. I will be content with this one, since God is\r\npleased for me to wear it.\"\r\n\r\nOn this reply, which contained two errors tending to heresy, the Lord\r\nBishop adjourned the court.[2269]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2269: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nThe morrow, the 25th of February, was the first Sunday in Lent. On\r\nthat day or another, but probably on that day, my Lord Bishop sent\r\nJeanne a shad. Having partaken of this fish she had fever and was\r\nseized with vomiting.[2270] Two masters of arts of the Paris\r\nUniversity, both doctors of medicine, Jean Tiphaine and Guillaume\r\nDelachambre, assessors in the trial, were summoned by the Earl of\r\nWarwick, who said to them:\r\n\r\n\"According to what has been told me, Jeanne is sick. I have summoned\r\nyou to devise measures for her recovery. The King would not for the\r\nworld have her die a natural death. She is dear to him, for he has\r\nbought her dearly; his intent is that she die not, save by the hand of\r\njustice, and that she should be burned. Do all that may be necessary,\r\ntherefore, visit her attentively, and endeavour to restore her.\"[2271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2270: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 48, 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2271: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nConducted to Jeanne by Maitre Jean d'Estivet, the doctors inquired of\r\nher the cause of her suffering.\r\n\r\nShe answered that she had eaten a carp sent her by the Lord Bishop of\r\nBeauvais, and that she believed it to be the cause of her sickness.\r\n\r\nDid Jeanne suspect the Bishop of designing to poison her? That is what\r\nMaitre Jean d'Estivet thought, for he flew into a violent rage:\r\n\r\n\"Whore!\" he cried, \"it is thine own doing; thou hast eaten herrings\r\nand other things which have made thee ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged insults, and Jeanne's sickness thereupon grew\r\nworse.[2272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2272: _Ibid._, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe doctors examined her and found that she had fever. Wherefore they\r\ndecided to bleed her.\r\n\r\nThey informed the Earl of Warwick, who became anxious:\r\n\r\n\"A bleeding!\" he cried; \"take heed! She is artful and might kill\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless Jeanne was bled and recovered.[2273]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2273: _Ibid._, pp. 51, 52.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 26th, there was no examination.[2274] On the opening of\r\nthe fourth sitting, Tuesday, the 27th, Maitre Jean Beaupere asked her\r\nhow she had been, which inquiry touched her but little. She replied\r\ndrily:\r\n\r\n\"You can see for yourself. I am as well as it is possible for me to\r\nbe.\"[2275]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2274: What induces me to fix this illness on the 25th of\r\nFebruary is Jean Beaupere's question at the sitting of the 27th, \"How\r\nhave you been?\" and Jeanne's ironical reply. This indisposition must\r\nnot be confused, as it generally has been, with Jeanne's serious\r\nillness, which occurred after Easter. The shad and the herrings belong\r\nnaturally to Lent; and Maitre Delachambre says explicitly that Jeanne\r\nrecovered after the bleeding.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2275: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nThis sitting was held in the Robing Chamber in the presence of\r\nfifty-four assessors.[2276] Five of them had not been present before,\r\nand among them was Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur, canon of Rouen, whose\r\nshare in the proceedings had been to act the Lorraine shoemaker and\r\nSaint Catherine of Alexandria.[2277]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2276: _Ibid._, pp. 68, 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2277: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 332, 362; vol. iii, pp. 60, 133,\r\n141, 156, 162, 173, 181.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere, as on the previous Saturday, was curious to know\r\nwhether Jeanne had heard her Voices. She heard them every day.[2278]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2278: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nHe asked her: \"Is it an angel's voice that speaketh unto you, or the\r\nvoice of a woman saint or of a man saint? Or is it God speaking\r\nwithout an interpreter?\"\r\n\r\nSaid Jeanne: \"This voice is the voice of Saint Catherine and of Saint\r\nMargaret; and on their heads are beautiful crowns, right rich and\r\nright precious. I am permitted to tell you so by Messire. If you doubt\r\nit send to Poitiers, where I was examined.\"[2279]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2279: _Ibid._, p. 71.]\r\n\r\nShe was right in appealing to the clerks of France. The Armagnac\r\ndoctors had no less authority in matters of faith than the English\r\nand Burgundian doctors. Were they not all to meet at the Council?\r\n\r\nThe examiner asked: \"How know ye that they are these two saints? Know\r\nye them one from another?\"\r\n\r\nSaid Jeanne: \"Well do I know who they are; and I do know one from the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the greeting they give me.\"[2280]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2280: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 72.]\r\n\r\nLet not Jeanne be hastily taxed with error or untruth. Did not the\r\nAngel salute Gideon (Judges vi), and Raphael salute Tobias (Tobit\r\nxii)?[2281]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2281: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 406.]\r\n\r\nThereafter Jeanne gave another reason: \"I know them because they call\r\nthemselves by name.\"[2282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2282: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 72.]\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked whether her saints were both clothed alike, whether\r\nthey were of the same age, whether they spoke at once, whether one of\r\nthem appeared before the other, she refused to reply, saying she had\r\nnot permission to do so.[2283]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2283: _Ibid._, pp. 72, 73.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere inquired which of the apparitions came to her the\r\nfirst when she was about thirteen.\r\n\r\nJeanne said: \"It was Saint Michael. I beheld him with my eyes. And he\r\nwas not alone, but with him were angels from heaven. It was by\r\nMessire's command alone that I came into France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you actually behold Saint Michael and these angels in the body?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw them with the eyes of my head as plainly as I see you; and when\r\nthey went away I wept and should have liked them to take me with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what semblance was Saint Michael?\"[2284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2284: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 73.]\r\n\r\nShe was not permitted to say.\r\n\r\nShe was asked whether she had received permission from God to go into\r\nFrance and whether God had commanded her to put on man's dress.\r\n\r\nBy keeping silence on this point she became liable to be suspected of\r\nheresy, and however she replied she laid herself open to serious\r\ncharges,--she either took upon herself homicide and abomination, or\r\nshe attributed it to God, which manifestly was to blaspheme.\r\n\r\nConcerning her coming into France, she said: \"I would rather have been\r\ndragged by the hair of my head than have come into France without\r\npermission from Messire.\" Concerning her dress she added: \"Dress is\r\nbut a little thing, less than nothing. It was not according to the\r\ncounsel of any man of this world that I put on man's clothing. I\r\nneither wore this attire nor did anything save by the command of\r\nMessire and his angels.\"[2285]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2285: _Ibid._, pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere asked: \"When you behold this Voice coming towards\r\nyou, is there any light?\"\r\n\r\nThen she replied with a jest, as at Poitiers: \"Every light cometh not\r\nto you, my fair lord.\"[2286]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2286: _Ibid._, p. 75. I have re-inserted \"my fine lord\"\r\naccording to _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nAfter all it was virtually against the King of France that these\r\ndoctors of Rouen were proceeding with craft and with cunning.\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere threw out the question: \"How did your King come\r\nto have faith in your sayings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they were proved good to him by signs and also because of his\r\nclerks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What revelations were made unto your King?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you will not hear from me this year.\"\r\n\r\nAs he listened to the damsel's words, must not my Lord of Beauvais,\r\nwho was in the counsels of King Henry, have reflected on that verse in\r\nthe Book of Tobias (xii, 7): \"It is good to keep close the secret of a\r\nking\"?\r\n\r\nThereafter Jeanne was called upon to reply at length concerning the\r\nsword of Saint Catherine. The clerks suspected her of having found it\r\nby the art of divination, and by invoking the aid of demons, and of\r\nhaving cast a spell over it. All that she was able to say did not\r\nremove their suspicions.[2287]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2287: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 75-77.]\r\n\r\nThen they passed on to the sword she had captured from a Burgundian.\r\n\r\n\"I wore it at Compiegne,\" she said, \"because it was good for dealing\r\nsound clouts and good buffets.\"[2288] The buffet was a flat blow, the\r\nclout was a side stroke. Some moments later, on the subject of her\r\nbanner, she said that, in order to avoid killing any one, she bore it\r\nherself when they charged the enemy. And she added: \"I have never\r\nslain any one.\"[2289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2288: _Ibid._, pp. 77, 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2289: _Ibid._, p. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe doctors found that her replies varied.[2290] Of course they varied.\r\nBut if like her every hour of the day and night the doctors had been\r\nseeing the heavens descending, if all their thoughts, all their\r\ninstincts, good and bad, all their desires barely formulated, had\r\nbeen undergoing instant transformation into divine commands, their\r\nreplies would likewise have varied, and they would have doubtless been\r\nin such a state of illusion that in their words and in their actions\r\nthey would have displayed less good sense, less gentleness and less\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2290: _Ibid._, p. 34; vol. ii, p. 318.]\r\n\r\nThe examinations were long; they lasted between three and four\r\nhours.[2291] Before closing this one, Maitre Jean Beaupere wished to\r\nknow whether Jeanne had been wounded at Orleans. This was an\r\ninteresting point. It was generally admitted that witches lost their\r\npower when they shed blood. Finally, the doctors quibbled over the\r\ncapitulation of Jargeau, and the court adjourned.[2292]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2291: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 350, 365.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2292: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 79, 80.]\r\n\r\nA famous Norman clerk, Maitre Jean Lohier, having come to Rouen, the Count\r\nBishop of Beauvais commanded that he should be informed concerning the\r\ntrial. On the first Saturday in Lent, the 24th of February, the Bishop\r\nsummoned him to his house near Saint-Nicolas-le-Painteur, and invited\r\nhim to give his opinion of the proceedings. The views of Maitre Jean\r\nLohier greatly disturbed the Bishop. Off he rushed to the doctors and\r\nmasters, Jean Beaupere, Jacques de Touraine, Nicolas Midi, Pierre\r\nMaurice, Thomas de Courcelles, Nicolas Loiseleur, and said to them:\r\n\r\n\"Here's Lohier, who holds fine views concerning our trial! He wants to\r\nobject to everything, and says that our proceedings are invalid. If we\r\nwere to take his advice we should begin everything over again, and all\r\nwe have done would be worthless! It is easy to see what he is aiming\r\nat. By Saint John, we will do nothing of the kind; we will go on with\r\nour trial now it is begun.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the Church of Notre Dame, Guillaume Manchon met\r\nMaitre Jean Lohier and asked him:\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen anything of the records of the trial?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" replied Maitre Jean. \"This trial is void. It is impossible\r\nto support it on many grounds: firstly, it is not in regular\r\nform.\"[2293]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2293: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 11, 341.]\r\n\r\nBy that he meant that proceedings should not have been taken against\r\nJeanne without preliminary inquiries concerning the probability of her\r\nguilt; either he did not know of the inquiries instituted by my Lord\r\nof Beauvais, or he deemed them insufficient.[2294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2294: See the evidence of Thomas de Courcelles in _Trial_,\r\nvol. iii, p. 38.]\r\n\r\n\"Secondly,\" continued Maitre Jean Lohier, \"the judges and assessors\r\nwhen they are trying this case are shut up in the castle, where they\r\nare not free to utter their opinions frankly. Thirdly, the trial\r\ninvolves divers persons who are not called, notably it touches the\r\nreputation of the King of France, to whose party Jeanne belonged, yet\r\nneither he nor his representative is cited. Fourthly, neither\r\ndocuments nor definite written charges have been produced, wherefore\r\nthis woman, this simple girl, is left to reply without guidance to so\r\nmany masters, to such great doctors and on such grave matters,\r\nespecially those concerning her revelations. For all these reasons the\r\ntrial appears to me to be invalid.\" Then he added: \"You see how they\r\nproceed. They will catch her if they can in her words. They take\r\nadvantage of the statements in which she says, 'I know for certain,'\r\nconcerning her apparitions. But if she were to say, 'It seems to me,'\r\ninstead of 'I know for certain,' it is my opinion that no man could\r\nconvict her. I perceive that the dominant sentiment which actuates\r\nthem is one of hatred. Their intention is to bring her to her death.\r\nWherefore I shall stay here no longer. I cannot witness it. What I say\r\ngives offence.\"[2295]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2295: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 12, 300, 341; vol. iii, p. 138.]\r\n\r\nThat same day Maitre Jean left Rouen.[2296]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2296: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 12, 203, 252, 300; vol. iii, pp.\r\n50, 138.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar incident occurred with regard to Maitre Nicolas de\r\nHouppeville, a famous cleric. In conference with certain churchmen, he\r\nexpressed the opinion that to appoint as Jeanne's judges members of\r\nthe party hostile to her was not a correct method of procedure; and he\r\nadded that Jeanne had already been examined by the clerks of Poitiers\r\nand by the Archbishop of Reims, the metropolitan of this very Bishop\r\nof Beauvais. Hearing of this expression of opinion, my Lord of\r\nBeauvais flew into a violent rage, and summoned Maitre Nicolas to\r\nappear before him. The latter replied that the Official of Rouen was\r\nhis superior, and that the Bishop of Beauvais was not his judge. If it\r\nbe true, as is related, that Maitre Nicolas was thereafter cast into\r\nthe King's prison, it was doubtless for a reason more strictly\r\njudicial than that of having offended the Lord Bishop of Beauvais. It\r\nis more probable, however, that this famous cleric did not wish to act\r\nas assessor, and that he left Rouen in order to avoid being summoned\r\nto take part in the trial.[2297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2297: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 252, 326, 354, 356; vol. iii, pp.\r\n171, 172.]\r\n\r\nCertain ecclesiastics, among others Maitre Jean Pigache, Maitre Pierre\r\nMinier, and Maitre Richard de Grouchet, discovered long afterwards\r\nthat being threatened they had given their opinions under the\r\ninfluence of fear. \"We were present at that trial,\" they said, \"but\r\nthroughout the proceedings we were always contemplating flight.\"[2298]\r\nAs a matter of fact, no violence was done to any man's opinions, and\r\nsuch as refused to attend the trial were in no way molested. Threats!\r\nBut why should there be any? Was it difficult to convict a witch in\r\nthose days? Jeanne was no witch. But, then, neither were the others.\r\nStill, between Jeanne and the other alleged witches there was this\r\ndifference, that Jeanne had cast her spells in favour of the\r\nArmagnacs, and to convict her was to render a service to the English,\r\nwho were the masters. This was a point to be taken into consideration;\r\nbut there was something else which ought also to be borne in mind by\r\nthoughtful folk: such a conviction would at the same time offend the\r\nFrench, who were in a fair way to become the masters once more in the\r\nplace of the English. These matters were very perplexing to the\r\ndoctors; but the second consideration had less weight with them than\r\nthe first; they had no idea that the French were so near reconquering\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2298: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 356, 359.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth session of the court took place in the usual chamber on the\r\n1st of March, in the presence of fifty-eight assessors, of whom nine\r\nhad not sat previously.[2299]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2299: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 80, 81.]\r\n\r\nThe first question the examiner put Jeanne was:\r\n\r\n\"What say you of our Lord the Pope, and whom think you to be the true\r\npope?\"\r\n\r\nShe adroitly made answer by asking another question: \"Are there\r\ntwo?\"[2300]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2300: _Ibid._, p. 82.]\r\n\r\nNo, there were not two; Clement VIII's abdication had put an end to\r\nthe schism; the great rift in the Church had been closed for thirteen\r\nyears and all Christian nations recognized the Pope of Rome; even\r\nFrance who had become resigned to the disappearance of her Avignon\r\npopes. There was something, however, which neither the accused nor her\r\njudges knew; on that 1st of March, 1431, far from there being two\r\npopes, there was not even one; the Holy See had fallen vacant by the\r\ndeath of Martin V on the 20th of February, and the vacancy was only to\r\nbe filled on the 3rd of March, by the election of Eugenius IV.[2301]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2301: _Analecta juris Pontif._, vol. xiv, p. 117.]\r\n\r\nThe examiner in questioning Jeanne concerning the Holy See was not\r\nwithout a motive. That motive became obvious when he asked her whether\r\nshe had not received a letter from the Count of Armagnac. She admitted\r\nhaving received the letter and having replied to it.\r\n\r\nCopies of these two letters were included in the evidence to be used\r\nat the trial. They were read to Jeanne.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the Count of Armagnac had asked the Maid by letter\r\nwhich of the three popes was the true one, and that Jeanne had replied\r\nto him, likewise by letter, that for the moment she had not time to\r\nanswer, but that she would do so at her leisure when she should come\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\nHaving heard these two letters read, Jeanne declared that the one\r\nattributed to her was only partially hers. And since she always\r\ndictated and could never read what had been taken down, it is\r\nconceivable that hasty words, uttered with her foot in the stirrup,\r\nmay not have been accurately transcribed; but in a series of involved\r\nand contradictory replies she was unable to demonstrate how that which\r\nshe had dictated differed from the written text;[2302] and in itself\r\nthe letter appears much more likely to have proceeded from an ignorant\r\nvisionary than from a clerk who would have some knowledge, however\r\nlittle, of church affairs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2302: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 82, 84.]\r\n\r\nIt contains certain words and turns of expression which are to be\r\nfound in Jeanne's other letters. There can hardly be any doubt that\r\nthis letter is by her; she had forgotten it. There is nothing\r\nsurprising in that; her memory, as we have seen, was curiously liable\r\nto fail her.[2303]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2303: The expression, \"_A Dieu vous recommande, Dieu soit\r\ngarde de vous_,\" occurs in the letters to the people of Tournai, to\r\nthose of Troyes and of Reims, and in the letter to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy. And what is still more significant, in two of these letters,\r\none to the people of Troyes, the other to the Duke of Burgundy, are\r\nthe words: \"_Le Roi du ciel, mon droiturier et souverain seigneur_.\"\r\n_Trial_, vol. i, p. 246.]\r\n\r\nOn this document the judges based the most serious of charges; they\r\nregarded it as furnishing proof of a most blamable temerity. What\r\narrogance on the part of this woman, so it seemed to them, to claim to\r\nhave been told by God himself that which the Church alone is entitled\r\nto teach! And to undertake by means of an inner illumination to point\r\nout the true pope, was that not to commit grave sin against the Bride\r\nof Christ, and with sacrilegious hand to rend the seamless robe of our\r\nLord?\r\n\r\nFor once Jeanne saw clearly how her judges were endeavouring to entrap\r\nher, wherefore she twice declared her belief in the Sovereign Pontiff\r\nof Rome.[2304] How bitterly she would have smiled had she known that\r\nthe lights of the University of Paris, these famous doctors who held\r\nit mortal sin to believe in the wrong pope, themselves believed in his\r\nHoliness about as much as they disbelieved in him; that at that very\r\ntime certain of their number, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles, so great a\r\ndoctor, Maitre Jean Beaupere, the examiner, Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur,\r\nwho acted the part of Saint Catherine, were hastening to despatch her,\r\nin order that they might bestride their mules and amble away to Bale,\r\nthere in the Synagogue of Satan to hurl thunderbolts against the Holy\r\nApostolic See, and diabolically to decree the subjection of the Pope\r\nto the Council, the confiscation of his annates, dearer to him than\r\nthe apple of his eye, and finally his own deposition.[2305] Now would\r\nhave been the time for her to have cried, with the voice of a simple\r\nsoul, to the priests so keen to avenge upon her the Church's honour:\r\n\"I am more of a Catholic than you!\" And the words in her mouth would\r\nhave been even more appropriate than on the lips of the Limousin clerk\r\nof old. Yet we must not reproach these clerics for having been good\r\nGallicans at Bale, but rather for having been cruel and hypocritical\r\nat Rouen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2304: _Ibid._, pp. 82, 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2305: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 27, 32, 75,\r\n82.]\r\n\r\nIn her prison the Maid prophesied before her guard, John Grey.\r\nInformed of these prophecies, the judges wished to hear them from\r\nJeanne's own mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Before seven years have passed,\" she said to them, \"the English shall\r\nlose a greater wager than any they lost at Orleans. They shall lose\r\neverything in France. They shall suffer greater loss than ever they\r\nhave suffered in France, and that shall come to pass because God shall\r\nvouchsafe unto the French great victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it by revelation made unto me and that this shall befall\r\nwithin seven years. And greatly should I sorrow were it further\r\ndelayed. I know it by revelation as surely as I know that you are\r\nbefore my eyes at this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall this come to pass?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know neither the day nor the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the year?\"\r\n\r\n\"That ye shall not know for the present. But I should wish it to be\r\nbefore Saint John's Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say that it should come to pass before Saint Martin in\r\nthe winter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that before Saint Martin in the winter many things should\r\nbefall and it might be that the English would be discomfited.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the examiner asked Jeanne whether when Saint Michael came to\r\nher he was accompanied by Saint Gabriel.\r\n\r\nJeanne replied: \"I do not remember.\"[2306]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2306: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 84, 85.]\r\n\r\nShe did not remember whether, in the multitude of angels who visited\r\nher, was the Angel Gabriel who had saluted Our Lady and announced unto\r\nher the salvation of mankind. So many angels and archangels had she\r\nseen that this one had not particularly impressed her.\r\n\r\nAfter an answer of such perfect simplicity how could these priests\r\nproceed to question her on her visions? Were they not sufficiently\r\nedified? But no! These innocent answers whetted the examiner's zeal.\r\nWith intense ardour and copious amplification, passing from angels to\r\nsaints, he multiplied petty and insidious questions. Did you see the\r\nhair on their heads? Had they rings in their ears? Was there anything\r\nbetween their crowns and their hair? Was their hair long and hanging?\r\nHad they arms? How did they speak? What kind of voices had they?[2307]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2307: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThis last question touched on an important theological point. Demons,\r\nwhose voices are as rasping as a cart wheel or a winepress screw,\r\ncannot imitate the sweet tones of saints.[2308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2308: Le Loyer, iv, _Livres des Spectres_, Angers, 1605, in\r\n4to.]\r\n\r\nJeanne replied that the Voice was beautiful, sweet, and soft, and\r\nspoke in French.\r\n\r\nWhereupon she was asked craftily wherefore Saint Margaret did not\r\nspeak English.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"How should she speak English, since she is not on the\r\nside of the English?\"[2309]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2309: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years before, a poet of Champagne had said that the French\r\nlanguage, which Our Lord created beautiful and graceful, was the\r\nlanguage of Paradise.\r\n\r\nShe was afterwards asked concerning her rings. This was a hard matter;\r\nin those days there were many magic rings or rings bearing amulets.\r\nThey were fashioned by magicians under the influence of planets; and,\r\nby means of wonder-working herbs and stones, these rings had spells\r\ncast upon them and received miraculous virtues. Constellation rings\r\nworked miracles. Jeanne, alas! had possessed but two poor rings, one\r\nof brass, inscribed with the names Jesus and Marie, which she received\r\nfrom her father and mother, the other her brother had given her. The\r\nBishop kept the latter; the other had been taken from her by the\r\nBurgundians.[2310]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2310: _Ibid._, pp. 86, 87. Vallet de Viriville, _Les anneaux\r\nde Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Memoires de la Societe des Antiquaires de\r\nFrance_, vol. xxx, 1868, pp. 82, 97.]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to incriminate her in a pact made with the Devil\r\nnear the Fairy Tree. She was not to be caught thus, but retorted by\r\nprophesying her deliverance and the destruction of her enemies. \"Those\r\nwho wish to banish me from this world may very likely leave it before\r\nme.... I know that my King will win the realm of France.\"\r\n\r\nShe was asked what she had done with her mandrake. She said she had\r\nnever had one.[2311]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2311: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThen the examiner appeared to be seized with curiosity concerning\r\nSaint Michael. \"Was he clothed?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Doubt ye that Messire lacks wherewithal to clothe\r\nhimself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore should he have cut it off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he hold scales?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"[2312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2312: _Ibid._, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nTheir object was to ascertain whether she saw Saint Michael as he was\r\nrepresented in the churches, with scales for weighing souls.[2313]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2313: A. Maury, _Croyances et legendes du moyen age_, pp. 171\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nWhen she said that at the sight of the Archangel it seemed to her she\r\nwas not in a state of mortal sin, the examiner fell to arguing on the\r\nsubject of her conscience. She replied like a true Christian.[2314]\r\nThen he returned to the miracle of the sign, which had not been\r\nreferred to since the first sitting, to the mystery of Chinon, to that\r\nwondrous crown, which Jeanne, following Saint Catherine of Alexandria,\r\nbelieved she had received from the hand of an angel. But she had\r\npromised Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret to say nothing about it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2314: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n\"When you showed the King the sign was there any one with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there was no other person, albeit there were many folk not\r\nfar off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see a crown on the King's head when you gave him this sign?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say without committing perjury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had your King a crown at Reims?\"\r\n\r\n\"My King, methinketh, took with pleasure the crown he found at Reims.\r\nBut afterwards a very rich crown was brought him. He did not wait for\r\nit, because he wished to hurry on the ceremony according to the\r\nrequest of the inhabitants of Reims who desired to rid their town of\r\nthe burden of men-at-arms. If he had waited he would have had a crown\r\na thousand times more rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen that richer crown?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you without committing perjury. If I have not seen it I\r\nhave heard tell how rich and how magnificent it is.\"[2315]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2315: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 90, 91.]\r\n\r\nJeanne suffered intensely from being deprived of the sacraments. One\r\nday when Messire Jean Massieu, performing the office of ecclesiastical\r\nusher, was taking her before her judges, she asked him whether there\r\nwere not on the way some church or chapel in which was the body of Our\r\nLord Jesus Christ.[2316]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2316: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nMessire Jean Massieu, dean of Rouen, was a cleric of manners\r\ndissolute; his inveterate lewdness had involved him in difficulties\r\nwith the Chapter and with the Official.[2317] He may have been neither\r\nas brave nor as frank as he wished to make out, but he was not hard\r\nor pitiless.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2317: De Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur le proces de\r\ncondamnation_, p. 115.]\r\n\r\nHe told his prisoner that there was a chapel on the way. And he\r\npointed out to her the chapel of the castle.\r\n\r\nThen she besought him urgently to take her into the chapel in order\r\nthat she might worship Messire and pray.\r\n\r\nReadily did Messire Jean Massieu consent; and he permitted her to\r\nkneel before the sanctuary. Devoutly bending, Jeanne offered her\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop, being informed of this incident, was highly\r\ndispleased. He instructed the Usher that in the future such devotions\r\nmust not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nAnd the Promoter, Maitre Jean d'Estivet, on his part, addressed many a\r\nreprimand to Messire Jean Massieu.\r\n\r\n\"Rascal,\" he said, \"what possesses thee to allow an excommunicated\r\nwhore to approach a church without permission? If ever thou doest the\r\nlike again I will imprison thee in that tower, where for a month thou\r\nwilt see neither sun nor moon.\"\r\n\r\nMessire Jean Massieu heeded not this threat. And the Promoter,\r\nperceiving this, himself took up his post at the chapel door when\r\nJeanne went that way. Thus he prevented the hapless damsel from\r\nengaging in her devotions.[2318]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2318: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe sixth sitting was held in the same court as before, in the\r\npresence of forty-one assessors, of whom six or seven were new, and\r\namong them was Maitre Guillaume Erart, doctor in theology.[2319]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2319: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 91, 92.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the examiner asked Jeanne whether she had seen Saint\r\nMichael and the saints, and whether she had seen anything but their\r\nfaces. He insisted: \"You must say what you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather than say all that I know, I would have my head cut off.\"[2320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2320: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 93.]\r\n\r\nThey puzzled her with questions touching the nature of angelic bodies.\r\nShe was simple; with her own eyes she had seen Saint Michael; she said\r\nso and could not say otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe examiner, now as always, informed of the words she had let fall in\r\nprison, asked her whether she had heard her Voices.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in good sooth. They told me that I should be delivered. But I\r\nknow neither the day nor the hour. And they told me to have good\r\ncourage, and to be of good cheer.\"[2321]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2321: _Ibid._, p. 94.]\r\n\r\nOf all this the judges believed nothing, because demonologists teach\r\nthat witches lose their power when an officer of Holy Church lays\r\nhands upon them.\r\n\r\nThe examiner recurred to her man's dress. Then he endeavoured to find\r\nout whether she had cast spells over the banners of her companions in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nHe sought out by what secret power she led the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis power she was willing to reveal: \"I said to them: 'Go on boldly\r\nagainst the English;' and at the same time I went myself.\"[2322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2322: _Ibid._, pp. 95-97.]\r\n\r\nIn this examination, which was the most diffuse and the most captious\r\nof all, the following curious question was put to the accused: \"When\r\nyou were before Jargeau, what was it you were wearing behind your\r\nhelmet? Was there not something round?\"[2323]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2323: _Ibid._, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Jargeau she had been struck on the head by a huge\r\nstone which had not hurt her; and this her own party deemed\r\nmiraculous.[2324] Did the judges of Rouen imagine that she wore a\r\ngolden halo, like the saints, and that this halo had protected her?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2324: _Chronique de la Pucelle_, p. 301. _Journal du siege_,\r\npp. 98, 99.]\r\n\r\nLater she was examined on a more ordinary subject, concerning a\r\npicture in the house of her host at Orleans, representing three women:\r\nJustice, Peace, Union.\r\n\r\nJeanne knew nothing about it;[2325] she was no connoisseur in tapestry\r\nand in paintings, like the Duke of Bar and the Duke of Orleans;\r\nneither were her judges, not on this occasion at any rate. And if they\r\nwere concerned about a picture in the house of Maitre Boucher, it was\r\nnot so much on account of the painting as of the doctrine. These three\r\nwomen that the wealthy Maitre Boucher kept in his house were doubtless\r\nnude. The painters of those days depicted on small panels allegories\r\nand bathing scenes, and they painted nude women. Full foreheads, round\r\nheads, golden hair, short figures of small build but with embonpoint,\r\ntheir nudity minutely represented and but thinly veiled; many such\r\nwere produced in Flanders and in Italy. The illustrious masters, to\r\nwhom those pictures appeared corrupt and indecent, doubtless wished to\r\nreproach Jeanne with having looked at them in the house of the\r\ntreasurer of the Duke of Orleans. It is not difficult to divine what\r\nwere the doctors' suspicions when they are found asking Jeanne whether\r\nSaint Michael wore clothes, in what manner she greeted her saints, and\r\nhow she gave them her rings to touch.[2326]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2325: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2326: _Ibid._, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nThey also wanted to make her admit that she had caused herself to be\r\nhonoured as a saint. She disconcerted them by the following reply:\r\n\"The poor folk came to me readily, because I did them no hurt, but\r\naided them to the best of my power.\"[2327]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2327: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nThen the examination ranged over many and various subjects: Friar\r\nRichard; the children Jeanne had held over the baptismal fonts; the\r\ngood wives of the town of Reims who touched rings with her; the\r\nbutterflies caught in a standard at Chateau Thierry.[2328]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2328: _Ibid._, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nIn this town, certain of the Maid's followers were said to have caught\r\nbutterflies in her standard. Now doctors in theology knew for a\r\ncertainty that necromancers sacrificed butterflies to the devil. A\r\ncentury before, at Pamiers, the tribunal of the Holy Inquisition had\r\ncondemned the Carmelite Pierre Recordi, who was accused of having\r\ncelebrated such a sacrifice. He had killed a butterfly and the devil\r\nhad revealed his presence by a breath of wind.[2329] Jeanne's judges\r\nmay have wished to involve her in similar fashion, or their design may\r\nhave been quite different. In war a butterfly in the cap was a sign\r\neither of unconditional surrender or of the possession of a safe\r\nconduct.[2330] Were the judges accusing her or her followers of having\r\nfeigned to surrender in order treacherously to attack the enemy? They\r\nwere quite capable of making such a charge. However that may be, the\r\nexaminer passed on to inquire concerning a lost glove found by Jeanne\r\nin the town of Reims.[2331] It was important to know whether it had\r\nbeen discovered by magic art. Then the magistrate returned to several\r\nof the capital charges of the trial: communion received in man's\r\ndress; the hackney of the Bishop of Senlis, which Jeanne had taken,\r\nthus committing a kind of sacrilege; the discoloured child she had\r\nbrought back to life at Lagny; Catherine de La Rochelle, who had\r\nrecently borne witness against her before the Official at Paris; the\r\nsiege of La Charite which she had been obliged to raise; the leap\r\nwhich she had made in her despair from the keep of Beaurevoir, and,\r\nfinally, certain blasphemy she was falsely accused of having uttered\r\nat Soissons concerning Captain Bournel.[2332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2329: Lea (1906), vol. iii, p. 456.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2330: _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2331: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2332: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 111.]\r\n\r\nThen the Lord Bishop declared the examination concluded. He added,\r\nhowever, that should it appear expedient to interrogate Jeanne more\r\nfully, certain doctors and masters would be appointed for that\r\npurpose.[2333]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2333: _Ibid._, pp. 111, 112.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on Saturday, March the 10th, Maitre Jean de la Fontaine,\r\nthe Bishop's commissioner, went to the prison. He was accompanied by\r\nNicolas Midi, Gerard Feuillet, Jean Fecard, and Jean Massieu.[2334] The\r\nfirst point touched upon at this inquiry was the sortie from\r\nCompiegne. The priests took great pains to prove to Jeanne that her\r\nVoices must be bad or that she must have failed to understand them\r\nsince her obedience to them had brought about her destruction. Jacques\r\nGelu[2335] and Jean Gerson had foreseen this dilemma and had met it in\r\nanticipation with elaborate theological arguments.[2336] She was\r\nexamined concerning the paintings on her standard, and she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret bade me take the standard and bear\r\nit boldly, and have painted upon it the King of Heaven. And this, much\r\nagainst my will, I told to my King. Touching its meaning I know nought\r\nelse.\"[2337]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2334: _Ibid._, p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2335: Gelu, _Questio quinta_, in _Memoires et consultations\r\nen faveur de Jeanne d'Arc_, ed. Lanery d'Arc, pp. 593 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2336: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 299 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2337: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 117.]\r\n\r\nThey tried to make her out avaricious, proud, and ostentatious because\r\nshe possessed a shield and arms, a stable, chargers, demi-chargers,\r\nand hackneys, and because she had money with which to pay her\r\nhousehold, some ten to twelve thousand livres.[2338] But the point on\r\nwhich they questioned her most closely was the sign which had already\r\nbeen twice discussed in the public examinations. On this subject the\r\ndoctors displayed an insatiable curiosity. For the sign was the exact\r\nreverse of the coronation at Reims; it was an anointing, not with\r\ndivine unction but with magic charm, the crowning of the King of\r\nFrance by a witch. Maitre Jean de la Fontaine had this advantage over\r\nJeanne, he knew what she was going to say and what she wished to\r\nconceal. \"What is the sign that was given to your King?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2338: _Ibid._, pp. 117, 119.]\r\n\r\n\"It is beautiful and honourable and very credible; it is the best and\r\nthe richest in the world....\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it still last?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well to know that it lasts and will last for a thousand years.\r\nMy sign is in the King's treasury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it of gold or silver, or of precious stones, or is it a crown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more will I tell unto you and no man can devise anything so\r\nrich as is this sign. Nevertheless, the sign that you need is that God\r\nshould deliver me out of your hands and no surer sign can he send\r\nyou....\"\r\n\r\n\"When the sign came to your King what reverence did you make to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thanked Our Lord for having delivered me from the troubles caused\r\nme by the clerks of our party, who were arguing against me. And I\r\nknelt down several times. An angel from God and from none other gave\r\nthe sign to my King. And many times did I give thanks to Our Lord. The\r\nclerks ceased to attack me when they had seen the said sign.\"[2339]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2339: On the contrary it was then that they began to argue\r\nagainst her or that they began to argue most effectively. She seems to\r\nforget that the interview at Chinon preceded the examination at\r\nPoitiers. It is interesting to notice that Brother Pasquerel, who was\r\ninformed of these matters by her, makes the same error in his\r\nevidence.]\r\n\r\n\"Did the churchmen of your party behold the sign?\"\r\n\r\n\"When my King and such as were with him had seen the sign and also the\r\nangel who gave it, I asked my King whether he were pleased, and he\r\nreplied that he was. Then I departed and went into a little chapel\r\nnear by. I have since heard that after my departure more than three\r\nhundred persons saw the sign. For love of me and in order that I\r\nshould be questioned no further, God was pleased to permit this sign\r\nto be seen by all those of my party who did see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did your King and you make any reverence to the angel when he brought\r\nthe sign?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for my part, I did. I knelt and took off my hood.\"[2340]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2340: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 120, 122.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL FOR LAPSE (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 12th of March, Brother Jean Lemaistre received from\r\nBrother Jean Graverent, Inquisitor of France, an order to proceed\r\nagainst and to pronounce the final sentence on a certain woman, named\r\nJeanne, commonly called the Maid.[2341] On that same day, in the\r\nmorning, Maitre Jean de la Fontaine, in presence of the Bishop, for\r\nthe second time examined Jeanne in her prison.[2342]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2341: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 122-124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2342: _Ibid._, p. 125.]\r\n\r\nHe first returned to the sign. \"Did not the angel who brought the sign\r\nspeak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he told my King that he must set me to work in order that the\r\ncountry might soon be relieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the angel, who brought the sign, the angel who first appeared\r\nunto you or another?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was always the same and never did he fail me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But inasmuch as you have been taken hath not the angel failed you\r\nwith regard to the good things of this life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since it is Our Lord's good pleasure, I believe it was best for me to\r\nbe taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the good things of grace hath not your angel failed you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can he have failed me when he comforteth me every day?\"[2343]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2343: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 126.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean de la Fontaine then put her a subtle question and one as\r\nnearly approaching humour as was permissible in an ecclesiastical\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n\"Did Saint Denys ever appear to you?\"[2344]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2344: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nSaint Denys, patron of the most Christian kings, Saint Denys, the war\r\ncry of France, had allowed the English to take his abbey, that rich\r\nchurch, to which queens came to receive their crowns, and wherein\r\nkings had their burying. He had turned English and Burgundian, and it\r\nwas not likely he would come to hold converse with the Maid of the\r\nArmagnacs.\r\n\r\nTo the question: \"Were you addressing God himself when you promised to\r\nremain a virgin?\" she replied:\r\n\r\n\"It sufficed to give the promise to the messengers of God, to wit,\r\nSaint Catherine and Saint Margaret.\"[2345]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2345: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThey had sought to entrap her, for a vow must be made directly to God.\r\nHowever, it might be argued, that it is lawful to promise a good thing\r\nto an angel or to a man; and that this good thing, thus promised, may\r\nform the substance of a vow. One vows to God what one has promised to\r\nthe saints. Pierre of Tarentaise (iv, dist: xxviii, a. 1) teaches that\r\nall vows should be made to God: either to himself directly or through\r\nthe mediation of his saints.[2346]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2346: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations_, pp. 224,\r\n434, 435. Le P. Ayroles, _La vraie Jeanne d'Arc_, vol. i, pp. 351 _et\r\nseq._, 481 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement made during the inquiry, Jeanne had given a\r\npromise of marriage to a young peasant. Now the examiner endeavoured\r\nto prove that she had been at liberty to break her vow of virginity\r\nmade in an irregular form; but Jeanne maintained that she had not\r\npromised marriage, and she added:\r\n\r\n\"The first time I heard my Voices, I vowed to remain a virgin as long\r\nas it should please God.\"\r\n\r\nBut this time it was Saint Michael and not the saints who had appeared\r\nto her.[2347] She herself found it difficult to unravel the tangled web\r\nof her dreams and her ecstasies. And from these vague visions of a\r\nchild the doctors were laboriously essaying to elaborate a capital\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2347: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 128.]\r\n\r\nThen a very grave and serious question was asked her by the examiner:\r\n\"Did you speak to your priest or to any other churchman of those\r\nvisions which you say were vouchsafed to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I spoke of them only to Robert de Baudricourt and to my\r\nKing.\"[2348]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2348: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe vavasour of Champagne, a man of mature years and sound sense, when\r\nin the days of King John, he, like the Maid, had heard a Voice in the\r\nfields bidding him go to his King, went straightway and told his\r\npriest. The latter commanded him to fast for three days, to do\r\npenance, and then to return to the field where the Voice had spoken to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe vavasour obeyed. Again the Voice was heard repeating the command\r\nit had previously given. The peasant again told his priest, who said\r\nto him: \"My brother, thou and I will abstain and fast for three days,\r\nand I will pray for thee to Our Lord Jesus Christ.\" This they did, and\r\non the fourth day the good man returned to the field. After the Voice\r\nhad spoken for the third time, the priest enjoined his parishioner to\r\ngo forthwith and fulfil his mission, since such was the will of\r\nGod.[2349]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2349: _Chronique des quatre premiers Valois_, p. 47.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, according to all appearances, this vavasour\r\nhad acted with greater wisdom than La Romee's daughter. By concealing\r\nher visions from the priest the latter had slighted the authority of\r\nthe Church Militant. Still there might be urged in her defence the\r\nwords of the Apostle Paul, that where the spirit of God is there is\r\nliberty.[2350] If ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the\r\nlaw.[2351] Was she a heretic or was she a saint? Therein lay the whole\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2350: II Corinthians, iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2351: Galatians v, 18. Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et\r\nconsultations_, p. 275.]\r\n\r\nThen came this remarkable question: \"Have you received letters from\r\nSaint Michael or from your Voices?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"I have not permission to tell you; but in a week I will\r\nwillingly say all I know.\"[2352]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2352: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 130.]\r\n\r\nSuch was her manner of speaking when there was something she wanted to\r\nconceal but not to deny. The question must have been embarrassing\r\ntherefore. Moreover, these interrogatories were based on a good store\r\nof facts either true or false; and in the questions addressed to the\r\nMaid we may generally discern a certain anticipation of her replies.\r\nWhat were those letters from Saint Michael and her other saints, the\r\nexistence of which she did not deny, but which were never produced by\r\nher judges? Did certain of her party send them in the hope that she\r\nwould carry out their intentions, while under the impression that she\r\nwas obeying divine commands?\r\n\r\nWithout insisting further for the present, the examiner passed on to\r\nanother grievance:\r\n\r\n\"Have not your Voices called you _daughter of God_, _daughter of the\r\nChurch_, _great-hearted damsel_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before the siege of Orleans and since, every day when they speak to\r\nme, many times have they called me _Jeanne the Maid, daughter of\r\nGod_.\"[2353]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2353: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 130, 131.]\r\n\r\nThe examination was suspended and resumed in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean de la Fontaine questioned Jeanne concerning a dream of her\r\nfather, of which the judges had been informed in the preliminary\r\ninquiry.[2354]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2354: _Ibid._, pp. 131, 132.]\r\n\r\nSad it is to reflect that when Jeanne was accused of the sin of having\r\nbroken God's commandment, \"Thou shalt honour thy father and thy\r\nmother,\" neither her mother nor any of her kin asked to be heard as\r\nwitnesses. And yet there were churchmen in her family;[2355] but a\r\ntrial on a question of faith struck terror into all hearts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2355: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 252. E. de Bouteiller and G. de\r\nBraux, _Nouvelles recherches sur la famille de Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 14,\r\n15. S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_, pp. xlvi _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAgain her man's dress was reverted to, and not for the last time.[2356]\r\nWe marvel at the profound meditations into which the Maid's doublet\r\nand hose plunged these clerics. They contemplated them with gloomy\r\nterror and in the light of the precepts of Deuteronomy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2356: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 133.]\r\n\r\nThereafter they questioned her touching the Duke of Orleans. Their\r\nobject was to show from her own replies that her Voices had deceived\r\nher when they promised the prisoner's deliverance. Here they easily\r\nsucceeded. Then she pleaded that she had not had sufficient time.\r\n\r\n\"Had I continued for three years without let or hindrance I should\r\nhave delivered him.\"\r\n\r\nIn her revelations there had been mentioned a term shorter than three\r\nyears and longer than one.[2357]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2357: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nQuestioned again touching the sign vouchsafed to her King, she replied\r\nthat she would take counsel with Saint Catherine.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Tuesday, the 13th of March, the Bishop and the\r\nVice-Inquisitor went to her prison. For the first time the\r\nVice-Inquisitor opened his mouth:[2358] \"Have you promised and sworn to\r\nSaint Catherine that you will not tell this sign?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2358: _Ibid._, pp. 134, 138.]\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the sign given to the King. Jeanne replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have sworn and I have promised that I will not myself reveal this\r\nsign, because I was too urgently pressed to tell it. I vow that never\r\nagain will I speak of it to living man.\"[2359]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2359: _Ibid._, p. 139.]\r\n\r\nThen she continued forthwith: \"The sign was that the Angel assured my\r\nKing, when bringing him the crown, that he should have the whole realm\r\nof France, with God's help and my labours, and that he should set me\r\nto work. That is to say, he should grant me men-at-arms. Otherwise he\r\nwould not be so soon crowned and anointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what manner did the Angel bring the crown? Did he place it on your\r\nKing's head?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was given to an archbishop, to the Archbishop of Reims, meseemeth\r\nin the King's presence. The said Archbishop received it and gave it\r\nto the King; and I myself was present; and it is put in the King's\r\ntreasury.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what place was the crown brought?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the King's chamber in the castle of Chinon.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what day and at what hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"The day I know not, the hour was full day. No further recollection\r\nhave I of the hour or of the month. But meseemeth it was the month of\r\nApril or March; it will be two years this month or next April. It was\r\nafter Easter.\"[2360]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2360: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 140, 141.]\r\n\r\n\"On the first day that you saw the sign did your King see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He had it the same day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what was the crown made?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well to know that it was of fine gold, and so rich that I\r\ncannot count its riches; and the crown meant that he would hold the\r\nrealm of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there jewels in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you that I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you touch it or kiss it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the Angel who bore it come from above, or did he come from the\r\nearth?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came from above. I understand that he came by Our Lord's command,\r\nand he came in by the door of the chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the Angel come along the ground, walking from the door of the\r\nroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he was come before the King he did him reverence, bowing low\r\nbefore him and uttering the words concerning the sign which I have\r\nalready repeated; and thereupon the Angel recalled to the King's mind\r\nthe great patience he had had in the midst of the long tribulation\r\nthat had befallen him; and as he came towards the King the Angel\r\nwalked and touched the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far was it from the door to the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Methinketh it was a full lance's length;[2361] and as he had come so\r\nhe returned. When the Angel came, I accompanied him and went with him\r\nup the steps into the King's chamber; and the Angel went in first. And\r\nI said to the King: 'Sire, behold your sign; take it.'\"[2362]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2361: About ten feet (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2362: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 141-142.]\r\n\r\nIn a spiritual sense we may say that this fable is true. This crown,\r\nwhich \"flowers sweetly and will flower sweetly if it be well\r\nguarded,\"[2363] is the crown of victory. When the Maid beholds the\r\nAngel who brought it, it is her own image that appears before her. Had\r\nnot a theologian of her own party said that she might be called an\r\nangel? Not that she had the nature of an angel, but she did the work\r\nof one.[2364]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2363: \"_Fleure bon et fleurera bon, pourvu qu'elle soit bien\r\ngardee._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2364: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations_, p. 212. Le\r\nP. Ayroles, _La vraie Jeanne d'Arc_, vol. i, p. 346.]\r\n\r\nShe began to describe the angels who had come with her to the King:\r\n\r\n\"So far as I saw, certain among them were very like, the others\r\ndifferent. Some had wings. Some wore crowns, others did not. And they\r\nwere with Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret, and they accompanied the\r\nAngel of whom I have spoken and the other angels also into the chamber\r\nof the King.\"[2365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2365: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 144.]\r\n\r\nAnd thus for a long time, as she was pressed by her interrogator, she\r\ncontinued to tell these marvellous stories one after another.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked for the second time whether the Angel had written\r\nher letters, she denied it.[2366] But now it was the Angel who bore the\r\ncrown and not Saint Michael who was in question. And despite her\r\nhaving said they were one and the same, she may have distinguished\r\nbetween them. Therefore we shall never know whether she did receive\r\nletters from Saint Michael the Archangel, or from Saint Catherine and\r\nfrom Saint Margaret.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2366: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 145.]\r\n\r\nThereafter the examiner inquired touching a cup lost at Reims and\r\nfound by Jeanne as well as the gloves.[2367] Saints sometimes\r\ncondescended to find things that had been lost, as is proved by the\r\nexample of Saint Antony of Padua. It was always with the help of God.\r\nNecromancers imitated their powers by invoking the aid of demons and\r\nby profaning sacred things.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2367: _Ibid._, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nShe was also questioned concerning the priest who had a concubine.\r\nHere again she was reproached with being possessed of a magic gift of\r\nclairvoyance. It was by magic she had known that this priest had a\r\nconcubine. Many other such things were reported of her. For example,\r\nit was said that at the sight of a certain loose woman she knew that\r\nthis woman had killed her child.[2368]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2368: Eberhard Windecke, pp. 184, 186.]\r\n\r\nThen recurred the same old questions: \"When you went to the attack on\r\nParis did you receive a revelation from your Voices? Was it revealed\r\nto you that you should go against La Charite? Was it a revelation that\r\ncaused you to go to Pont-l'Eveque?\"\r\n\r\nShe denied that she had then received any revelation from her Voices.\r\n\r\nThe last question was: \"Did you not say before Paris, 'Surrender the\r\ntown in the name of Jesus'?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered that she had not spoken those words, but had said,\r\n\"Surrender the town to the King of France.\"[2369]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2369: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 147, 148.]\r\n\r\nThe Parisians who were engaged in repelling the attack had heard her\r\nsaying, \"Surrender to us speedily in the name of Jesus.\" These words\r\nare consistent with all we know of Jeanne in the early years of her\r\ncareer. She believed it to be the will of Messire that the towns of\r\nthe realm should surrender to her, whom he had sent to reconquer them.\r\nWe have noticed already that at the time of her trial Jeanne had\r\ncompletely lost touch with her early illuminations and that she spoke\r\nin quite another language.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Wednesday, the 14th of March, there were two more\r\nexaminations in the prison. The morning interrogatory turned on the\r\nleap from Beaurevoir. She confessed to having leapt without permission\r\nfrom her Voices, preferring to die rather than to fall into the hands\r\nof the English.[2370]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2370: _Ibid._, pp. 150, 152.]\r\n\r\nShe was accused of blasphemy against God; but that was false.[2371]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2371: _Ibid._, p. 157.]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop intervened: \"You have said that we, the Lord Bishop, run\r\ngreat danger by bringing you to trial. Of what danger were you\r\nspeaking? In what peril do we stand, we, your judges, and others?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said to my Lord of Beauvais: 'You declare that you are my judge, I\r\nknow not if you be. But take heed that ye judge not wrongly, for thus\r\nwould ye run great danger; and I warn you, so that if Our Lord\r\nchastise you for it, I have done my duty by warning you.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this peril or this danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saint Catherine has told me that I shall have succour. I know not\r\nwhether it will be my deliverance from prison, or whether, during the\r\ntrial, some tumult shall arise whereby I shall be delivered. I think\r\nit will be either one or the other. My Voices most often tell me I\r\nshall be delivered by a great victory. And afterwards they say to me:\r\n'Be thou resigned, grieve not at thy martyrdom; thou shalt come in the\r\nend to the kingdom of Paradise.' This do my Voices say unto me simply\r\nand absolutely. I mean to say without fail. And I call my martyrdom\r\nthe trouble and anguish I suffer in prison. I know not whether still\r\ngreater sufferings are before me, but I wait on the Lord.\"[2372]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2372: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 154, 156.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that thus her Voices promised the Maid at once a\r\nspiritual and a material deliverance, but the two could hardly occur\r\ntogether. This reply, expressive alike of fear and of illusion, was\r\none to call forth pity from the hardest; and yet her judges regarded\r\nit merely as a means whereby they might entrap her. Feigning to\r\nunderstand that from her revelations she derived a heretical\r\nconfidence in her eternal salvation, the examiner put to her an old\r\nquestion in a new form. She had already given it a saintly answer. He\r\ninquired whether her Voices had told her that she would finally come\r\nto the kingdom of Paradise if she continued in the assurance that she\r\nwould be saved and not condemned in Hell. To this she replied with\r\nthat perfect faith with which her Voices inspired her: \"I believe what\r\nmy Voices have told me touching my salvation as strongly as if I were\r\nalready in Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a reply was heretical. The examiner, albeit he was not accustomed\r\nto discuss the Maid's replies, could not forbear remarking that this\r\none was of great importance.[2373]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2373: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 156.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly in the afternoon of that same day, she was shown a\r\nconsequence of her error; to wit, that if she received from her Voices\r\nthe assurance of eternal salvation she needed not to confess.[2374]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2374: _Ibid._, p. 157.]\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Jeanne was questioned touching the affair of Franquet\r\nd'Arras. The Bailie of Senlis had done wrong in asking the Maid for\r\nher prisoner,[2375] the Lord Franquet,[2376] in order to put him to\r\ndeath, and Jeanne's judges now incriminated her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2375: See _ante_, pp. 124 _et seq._ (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2376: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 158, 159.]\r\n\r\nThe examiner pointed out the mortal sins with which the accused might\r\nbe charged: first, having attacked Paris on a feast-day; second,\r\nhaving stolen the hackney of the Lord Bishop of Senlis; third, having\r\nleapt from Beaurevoir; fourth, having worn man's dress; fifth, having\r\nconsented to the death of a prisoner of war. Touching all these\r\nmatters, Jeanne did not believe that she had committed mortal sin; but\r\nwith regard to the leap from Beaurevoir she acknowledged that she was\r\nwrong, and that she had asked God to forgive her.[2377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2377: _Ibid._, pp. 159, 161.]\r\n\r\nIt was sufficiently established that the accused had fallen into\r\nreligious error. The tribunal of the Inquisition, out of its abounding\r\nmercy, desired the salvation of the sinner. Wherefore on the morning\r\nof the very next day, Thursday, the 15th of March, my Lord of Beauvais\r\nexhorted Jeanne to submit to the Church, and essayed to make her\r\nunderstand that she ought to obey the Church Militant, for the Church\r\nMilitant was one thing and the Church Triumphant another. Jeanne\r\nlistened to him dubiously.[2378] On that day she was again questioned\r\ntouching her flight from the chateau of Beaulieu and her intention to\r\nleave the tower without the permission of my Lord of Beauvais. As to\r\nthe latter she was firmly resolute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2378: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n\"Were I to see the door open, I would go, and it would be with the\r\npermission of Our Lord. I firmly believe that if I were to see the\r\ndoor open and if my guards and the other English were beyond power of\r\nresistance, I should regard it as my permission and as succour sent\r\nunto me by Our Lord. But without permission I would not go, save that\r\nI might essay to go, in order to know whether it were Our Lord's will.\r\nThe proverb says: 'Help thyself and God will help thee.'[2379] This I\r\nsay so that, if I were to go, it should not be said I went without\r\npermission.\"[2380]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2379: _Ayde-toy, Dieu te aidera._ _Le Jouvencel_, vol. ii, p.\r\n33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2380: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 163, 164.]\r\n\r\nThen they reverted to the question of her wearing man's dress.\r\n\r\n\"Which would you prefer, to wear a woman's dress and hear mass, or to\r\ncontinue in man's dress and not to hear mass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Promise me that I shall hear mass if I am in woman's dress, and then\r\nI will answer you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you that you shall hear mass when you are in woman's\r\ndress.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you say if I have promised and sworn to our King not to\r\nput off these clothes? Nevertheless, I say unto you: 'Have me a robe\r\nmade, long enough to touch the ground, but without a train. I will go\r\nto mass in it; then, when I come back, I will return to my present\r\nclothes.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You must wear woman's dress altogether and without conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send me a dress like that worn by your burgess's daughters, to wit, a\r\nlong _houppelande_; and I will take it and even a woman's hood to go\r\nand hear mass. But with all my heart I entreat you to leave me these\r\nclothes I am now wearing, and let me hear mass without changing\r\nanything.\"[2381]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2381: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 165, 166.]\r\n\r\nHer aversion to putting off man's dress is not to be explained solely\r\nby the fact that this dress preserved her best against the violence of\r\nthe men-at-arms; it is possible that no such objection existed. She\r\nwas averse to wearing woman's dress because she had not received\r\npermission from her Voices; and we may easily divine why not. Was she\r\nnot a chieftain of war? How humiliating for such an one to wear\r\npetticoats like a townsman's wife! And above all things just now, when\r\nat any moment the French might come and deliver her by some great feat\r\nof arms. Ought they not to find their Maid in man's attire, ready to\r\nput on her armour and fight with them?\r\n\r\nThereafter the examiner asked her whether she would submit to the\r\nChurch, whether she made a reverence to her Voices, whether she\r\nbelieved the saints, whether she offered them lighted candles, whether\r\nshe obeyed them, whether in war she had ever done anything without\r\ntheir permission or contrary to their command.[2382]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2382: _Ibid._, pp. 166-169.]\r\n\r\nThen they came to the question which they held to be the most\r\ndifficult of all:\r\n\r\n\"If the devil were to take upon himself the form of an angel, how\r\nwould you know whether he were a good angel or a bad?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied with a simplicity which appeared presumptuous: \"I should\r\neasily discern whether it were Saint Michael or an imitation of\r\nhim.\"[2383]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2383: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 170, 171.]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on Saturday, the 17th of March, Jeanne was examined in\r\nher prison both morning and evening.[2384]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2384: _Ibid._, p. 173.]\r\n\r\nHitherto she had been very loath to describe the countenance and the\r\ndress of the angel and the saints who had visited her in the village.\r\nMaitre Jean de la Fontaine endeavoured to obtain some light on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"In what form and semblance did Saint Michael come to you? Was he tall\r\nand how was he clothed?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came in the form of a true _prud'homme_.\"[2385]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2385: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nJeanne was not one to believe she saw the Archangel in a long doctor's\r\nrobe or wearing a cope of gold. Moreover it was not thus that he\r\nfigured in the churches. There he was represented in painting and in\r\nsculpture, clothed in glittering armour, with a golden crown on his\r\nhelmet.[2386] In such guise did he appear to her \"in the form of a\r\nright true _prud'homme_,\" to take a word from the _Chanson de Roland_,\r\nwhere a great sword thrust is called the thrust of a _prud'homme_. He\r\ncame to her in the garb of a great knight, like Arthur and\r\nCharlemagne, wearing full armour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2386: S. Luce, _Jeanne d'Arc a Domremy_. Proofs and\r\nillustrations, pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\nOnce again the examiner put to Jeanne that question on which her life\r\nor death depended:\r\n\r\n\"Will you submit all your deeds and sayings, good or bad, to the\r\njudgment of our mother, Holy Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the Church, I love her and would maintain her with all my\r\npower, for religion's sake,\" the Maid replied; \"and I am not one to be\r\nkept from church and from hearing mass. But as for the good works\r\nwhich I have wrought, and touching my coming, for them I must give an\r\naccount to the King of Heaven, who has sent me to Charles, son of\r\nCharles, King of France. And you will see that the French will shortly\r\naccomplish a great work, to which God will appoint them, in which they\r\nwill shake nearly all France. I say it in order that when it shall\r\ncome to pass, it may be remembered that I have said it.\"[2387]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2387: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 174.]\r\n\r\nBut she was unable to name the time when this great work should be\r\naccomplished; and Maitre Jean de la Fontaine returned to the point on\r\nwhich Jeanne's fate depended.\r\n\r\n\"Will you submit to the judgment of the Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to Our Lord, who hath sent me, to Our Lady and to all the\r\nblessed saints in Paradise. To my mind Our Lord and his Church are\r\none, and no distinction should be made. Wherefore do you essay to make\r\nout that they are not one?\"\r\n\r\nIn justice to Maitre Jean de la Fontaine we are bound to admit the\r\nlucidity of his reply. \"There is the Church Triumphant, in which are\r\nGod, his saints, the angels and the souls that are saved,\" he said.\r\n\"There is also the Church Militant, which is our Holy Father, the\r\nPope, the Vicar of God on earth; the cardinals, the prelates of the\r\nChurch and the clergy, with all good Christians and Catholics; and\r\nthis Church in its assembly cannot err, for it is moved by the Holy\r\nGhost. Will you appeal to the Church Militant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am come to the King of France from God, from the Virgin Mary and\r\nall the blessed saints in Paradise and from the Church Victorious\r\nabove and by their command. To this Church I submit all the good deeds\r\nI have done and shall do. As to replying whether I will submit to the\r\nChurch Militant, for the present, I will make no further answer.\"[2388]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2388: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 174, 176.]\r\n\r\nAgain she was offered a woman's dress in which to hear mass; she\r\nrefused it.\r\n\r\n\"As for a woman's dress, I will not take it yet, not until it be Our\r\nLord's will. And if it should come to pass that I be taken to judgment\r\nand there divested of my clothes, I beg my lords of the Church the\r\nfavour of a woman's smock and covering for my head. I would rather die\r\nthan deny what Our Lord hath caused me to do. I believe firmly that\r\nOur Lord will not let it come to pass that I should be cast so low,\r\nand that soon I shall have help from God, and that by a miracle.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter the following questions were put to her: \"Do you not\r\nbelieve to-day that fairies are evil spirits?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know whether Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret hate the\r\nEnglish?\"\r\n\r\n\"They love what Our Lord loves and hate what God hates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does God hate the English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Touching the love or hatred of God for the English and what he will\r\ndo for their souls I know nothing. But I do know that they will all\r\nbe driven out of France, save those who die there, and that God will\r\nsend victory to the French and defeat to the English.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was God on the side of the English when they prospered in France?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether God hated the French. But I believe that he\r\npermitted them to be beaten for their sins, if they were in sin.\"[2389]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2389: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 178.]\r\n\r\nJeanne was asked certain questions touching the banner on which she\r\nhad caused angels to be painted.\r\n\r\nShe replied that she had had angels painted as she had seen them\r\nrepresented in churches.[2390]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2390: _Ibid._, p. 180.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the examination was adjourned. The last interrogation in\r\nthe prison[2391] took place after dinner. She had now endured fifteen\r\nin twenty-five days, but her courage never flagged. This last time the\r\nsubjects were more than usually diverse and confused. First, the\r\nexaminer essayed to discover by what charms and evil practices good\r\nfortune and victory had attended the standard painted with angelic\r\nfigures. Then he wanted to know wherefore the clerks put on Jeanne's\r\nletters the sacred names of Jesus and Marie.[2392]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2391: _Ibid._, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2392: _Ibid._, pp. 182-183.]\r\n\r\nThen came the following subtle question: \"Do you believe that if you\r\nwere married your Voices would come to you?\"\r\n\r\nIt was well known that she dearly cherished her virginity. Certain of\r\nher words might be interpreted to mean that she considered this\r\nvirginity to be the cause of her good fortune; wherefore her examiners\r\nwere curious to know whether if she were adroitly approached she\r\nmight not be brought to cast scorn on the married state and to condemn\r\nintercourse between husbands and wives. Such a condemnation would have\r\nbeen a grievous error, savouring of the heresy of the Cathari.[2393]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2393: Martene and Durand, _Thesaurus novus anecdotorum_, vol.\r\nv, col. 1760 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"I know not and I appeal to Our Lord.\"[2394] Then there\r\nfollowed another question much more dangerous for one who like Jeanne\r\nloved her King with all her heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2394: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 183.]\r\n\r\n\"Do you think and firmly believe that your King did right to kill or\r\ncause to be killed my Lord of Burgundy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was sore pity for the realm of France.\"[2395]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2395: _Ibid._, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nThen did the examiner put to her this grave question: \"Do you hold\r\nyourself bound to answer the whole truth to the Pope, God's Vicar, on\r\nall that may be asked you touching religion and your conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\"I demand to be taken before him. Then will I make unto him such\r\nanswer as behoveth.\"[2396]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2396: _Ibid._, pp. 184, 185.]\r\n\r\nThese words involved an appeal to the Pope, and such an appeal was\r\nlawful. \"In doubtful matters touching on religion,\" said St. Thomas,\r\n\"there ought always to be an appeal to the Pope or to the General\r\nCouncil.\" If Jeanne's appeal were not in regular judicial form, it was\r\nnot her fault. She was ignorant of legal matters and neither guide nor\r\ncounsel had been granted to her. To the best of her knowledge, and\r\naccording to wont and justice, she appealed to the common father of\r\nthe faithful.\r\n\r\nThe doctors and masters were silent. And thus was closed against the\r\naccused the one way of deliverance remaining to her. She was now\r\nhopelessly lost. It is not surprising that Jeanne's judges, who were\r\npartisans of England, ignored her right of appeal; but it is\r\nsurprising that the doctors and masters of the French party, the\r\nclerks of the provinces loyal to King Charles, did not all and with\r\none voice sign an appeal and demand that the Maid, who had been judged\r\nworthy by her examiners at Poitiers, should be taken before the Pope\r\nand the Council.\r\n\r\nInstead of replying to Jeanne's request, the examiners inquired\r\nfurther concerning those much discussed magic rings and apparitions of\r\ndemons.[2397]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2397: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 185.]\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever kiss and embrace the Saints, Catherine and Margaret?\"\r\n\r\n\"I embraced them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they of a sweet savour?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well to know. Yea, their savour was sweet.\"\r\n\r\n\"When embracing them did you feel heat or anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not have embraced them without feeling and touching them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What part did you kiss, face or feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is more fitting to kiss their feet than their faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not give them chaplets of flowers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often done them honour by crowning with flowers their images\r\nin churches. But to those who appeared to me never have I given\r\nflowers as far as I can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know you aught of those who consort with fairies?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never done so nor have I known anything about them. Yet I have\r\nheard of them and that they were seen on Thursdays; but I do not\r\nbelieve it, and to me it seems sorcery.\"[2398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2398: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 187.]\r\n\r\nThen came a question touching her standard, deemed enchanted by her\r\njudges. It elicited one of those epigrammatic replies she loved.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore was your standard rather than those of the other captains\r\ncarried into the church of Reims?\"\r\n\r\n\"It had been in the contest, wherefore should it not share the\r\nprize?\"[2399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2399: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nNow that the inquiries and examinations were concluded, it was\r\nannounced that the preliminary trial was at an end. The so-called\r\ntrial in ordinary opened on the Tuesday after Palm Sunday, the 27th of\r\nMarch, in a room near the great hall of the castle.[2400]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2400: _Ibid._, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nBefore ordering the deed of accusation to be read, my Lord of Beauvais\r\noffered Jeanne the aid of an advocate.[2401] If this offer had been\r\npostponed till then, it was doubtless because in his opinion Jeanne\r\nhad not previously needed such aid. It is well known that a heretic's\r\nadvocate, if he would himself escape falling into heresy, must\r\nstrictly limit his methods of defence. During the preliminary inquiry\r\nhe must confine himself to discovering the names of the witnesses for\r\nthe prosecution and to making them known to the accused. If the\r\nheretic pleaded guilty then it was useless to grant him an\r\nadvocate.[2402] Now my Lord maintained that the accusation was founded\r\nnot on the evidence of witnesses but on the avowals of the accused.\r\nAnd this was doubtless his reason for not offering Jeanne an advocate\r\nbefore the opening of the trial in ordinary, which bore upon matters\r\nof doctrine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2401: _Ibid._, p. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2402: J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, pp. 130, 131. E.\r\nMeru, _Directorium Inquisitorium_, Romae, 1578, p. 295.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop thus addressed the Maid: \"Jeanne,\" said he, \"all\r\npersons here present are churchmen of consummate knowledge, whose will\r\nand intention it is to proceed against you in all piety and kindness,\r\nseeking neither vengeance nor corporal chastisement, but your\r\ninstruction and your return into the way of truth and salvation. As\r\nyou are neither learned nor sufficiently instructed in letters or in\r\nthe difficult matters which are to be discussed, to take counsel of\r\nyourself, touching what you should do or reply, we offer you to choose\r\nas your advocate one or more of those present, as you will. If you\r\nwill not choose, then one shall be appointed for you by us, in order\r\nthat he may advise you touching what you may do or say....\"[2403]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2403: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 200, 201. J. Quicherat, _Apercus\r\nnouveaux_, pp. 129, 130.]\r\n\r\nConsidering what the method of procedure was, this was a gracious\r\noffer. And even though my Lord of Beauvais obliged the accused to\r\nchoose from among the counsellors and assessors, whom he had himself\r\nsummoned to the trial, he did more than he was bound to do. The choice\r\nof a counsel did not belong to the accused; it belonged to the judge,\r\nwhose duty it was to appoint an honest, upright person. Moreover, it\r\nwas permissible for an ecclesiastical judge to refuse to the end to\r\ngrant the accused any counsel whatsoever. Nicolas Eymeric, in his\r\n_Directorium_, decides that the Bishop and the Inquisitor, acting\r\nconjointly, may constitute authority sufficient for the interpretation\r\nof the law and may proceed informally, _de plano_, dispensing with the\r\nceremony of appointing counsel and all the paraphernalia of a\r\ntrial.[2404]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2404: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition_,\r\npp. 400 _et seq._ U. Chevalier, _L'abjuration de Jeanne d'Arc_, p.\r\n34.]\r\n\r\nWe may notice that my Lord of Beauvais offered the accused an advocate\r\non the ground of her ignorance of things divine and human, but without\r\ntaking her youthfulness into account. In other courts of law\r\nproceedings against a minor--that is, a person under twenty-five--who\r\nwas not assisted by an advocate, were legally void.[2405] If this rule\r\nhad been binding in Inquisitorial procedure the Bishop, by his offer\r\nof legal aid, would have avoided any breach of this rule; and as the\r\nchoice of an advocate lay with him, he might well have done so without\r\nrunning any risk. \"Our justice is not like theirs,\" Bernard Gui\r\nrightly said, when he was comparing inquisitorial procedure with that\r\nof the other ecclesiastical courts which conformed to the Roman law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2405: Meru, _Directorium Inquisitorium_, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nJeanne did not accept the judge's offer: \"First,\" she said, \"touching\r\nwhat you admonish me for my good and in matters of religion, I thank\r\nyou and the company here assembled. As for the advocate you offer me,\r\nI also thank you, but it is not my intent to depart from the counsel\r\nof Our Lord. As for the oath you wish me to take, I am ready to swear\r\nto speak the truth in all that concerns your suit.\"[2406]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2406: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 201.]\r\n\r\nThereupon Maitre Thomas de Courcelles began to read in French the\r\nindictment which the Promoter had drawn up in seventy articles.[2407]\r\nThis text set forth in order the deeds with which Jeanne had already\r\nbeen reproached and which were groundlessly held to have been\r\nconfessed by her and duly proved. There were no less than seventy\r\ndistinct charges of horrible crimes committed against religion and\r\nHoly Mother Church. Questioned on each article, Jeanne with heroic\r\ncandour repeated her previous replies. The tedious reading of this\r\nlong accusation was continued and completed on the 28th of March, the\r\nWednesday after Palm Sunday.[2408] As was her wont, she asked for delay\r\nin order to reply on certain points. On Easter Eve, the 31st of March,\r\nthe time granted having expired, my Lord of Beauvais went to the\r\nprison, and, in the presence of the doctors and masters of the\r\nUniversity, demanded the promised replies. They nearly all touched on\r\nthe one accusation which included all the rest, the heresy in which\r\nall heresies were comprehended,--the refusal to obey the Church\r\nMilitant. Jeanne finally declared her resolve to appeal to Our Lord\r\nrather than to any man; this was to set at naught the authority of the\r\nPope and the Council.[2409]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2407: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 202-323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2408: _Ibid._, p. 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2409: _Ibid._, pp. 324, 325.]\r\n\r\nThe doctors and masters of the University of Paris advised that an\r\nepitome should be made of the Promoter's voluminous indictment, its\r\nchief points selected, and the seventy charges considerably\r\nreduced.[2410] Maitre Nicolas Midi, doctor in theology, performed this\r\ntask and submitted it when done to the judges and assessors.[2411] One\r\nof them proposed emendations. Brother Jacques of Touraine, a friar of\r\nthe Franciscan order, who was charged to draw up the document in its\r\nfinal stage, admitted most of the corrections requested.[2412] In this\r\nwise the incriminating propositions,[2413] which the judges claimed,\r\nbut claimed falsely, to have derived from the replies of the accused,\r\nwere resolved into twelve articles.[2414]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2410: _Ibid._, p. 327; vol. iii, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2411: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 60. U. Chevalier, _L'abjuration\r\nde Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2412: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 232. J. Quicherat, _Apercus\r\nnouveaux_, pp. 124, 129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2413: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 22, 212; vol. iii, p. 306; vol.\r\nv, p. 461.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2414: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 328, 336.]\r\n\r\nThese twelve articles were not communicated to Jeanne. On Thursday,\r\nthe 12th of April, twenty-one masters and doctors met in the chapel of\r\nthe Bishop's Palace, and, after having examined the articles, engaged\r\nin a conference, the result of which was unfavourable to the\r\naccused.[2415]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2415: _Ibid._, p. 337.]\r\n\r\nAccording to them, the apparitions and revelations of which she\r\nboasted came not from God. They were human inventions, or the work of\r\nan evil spirit. She had not received signs sufficient to warrant her\r\nbelieving in them. In the case of this woman these doctors and masters\r\ndiscovered lies; a lack of verisimilitude; faith lightly given;\r\nsuperstitious divinings; deeds scandalous and irreligious; sayings\r\nrash, presumptuous, full of boasting; blasphemies against God and his\r\nsaints. They found her to have lacked piety in her behaviour towards\r\nfather and mother; to have come short in love towards her neighbour;\r\nto have been addicted to idolatry, or at any rate to the invention of\r\nlying tales and to schismatic conversation destructive of the unity,\r\nthe authority and the power of the Church; and, finally, to have been\r\nskilled in the black art and to have strongly inclined to heresy.[2416]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2416: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 337, 374.]\r\n\r\nHad she not been sustained and comforted by her heavenly Voices, the\r\nVoices of her own heart, Jeanne would never have endured to the end of\r\nthis terrible trial. Not only was she being tortured at once by the\r\nprinces of the Church and the rascals of the army, but her sufferings\r\nof body and mind were such as could never have been borne by any\r\nordinary human being. Yet she suffered them without her constancy, her\r\nfaith, her divine hope, one might almost say her cheerfulness, ever\r\nbeing diminished. Finally she gave way; her physical strength, but not\r\nher courage, was exhausted; she fell a victim to an illness which was\r\nexpected to be fatal. She seemed near her end, or rather, alas! near\r\nher release.[2417]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2417: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 18th of April, my Lord of Beauvais and the\r\nVice-Inquisitor of the Faith went to her with divers doctors and\r\nmasters to exhort her in all charity; she was still very seriously\r\nsick.[2418] My Lord of Beauvais represented to her that when on certain\r\ndifficult matters she had been examined before persons of great\r\nwisdom, many things she had said had been noted as contrary to\r\nreligion. Wherefore, considering that she was but an unlettered woman,\r\nhe offered to provide her with men learned and upright who would\r\ninstruct her. He requested the doctors present to give her salutary\r\ncounsel, and he invited her herself, if any other such persons were\r\nknown to her, to indicate them, promising to summon them without fail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2418: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 374-375.]\r\n\r\n\"The Church,\" he added, \"never closes her heart against those who will\r\nreturn to her.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne answered that she thanked him for what he had said for her\r\nsalvation, and she added: \"Meseemeth, that seeing the sickness in\r\nwhich I lie, I am in great danger of death. If it be thus, then may\r\nGod do with me according to his good pleasure. I demand that ye permit\r\nme to confess, that ye also give me the body of my Saviour and bury me\r\nin holy ground.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lord of Beauvais represented to her that if she would receive the\r\nsacraments she must submit to the Church.\r\n\r\n\"If my body die in prison,\" she replied, \"I depend on you to have it\r\nput in holy ground; if you do not, then I appeal to Our Lord.\"[2419]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2419: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 376, 378.]\r\n\r\nThen she vehemently maintained the truth of the revelations she had\r\nreceived from God, Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret.\r\n\r\nAnd when she was asked yet again whether she would submit herself and\r\nher acts to Holy Mother Church, she replied: \"Whatever happens to me,\r\nI will never do or say aught save what I have already said at the\r\ntrial.\"[2420]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2420: _Ibid._, p. 379.]\r\n\r\nThe doctors and masters one after the other exhorted her to submit to\r\nHoly Mother Church. They quoted numerous passages from Holy Writ. They\r\npromised her the body of Our Lord if she would obey; but she remained\r\nresolute.\r\n\r\n\"Touching this submission,\" she said, \"I will reply naught save what I\r\nhave said already. I love God, I serve him, I am a good Christian, and\r\nI wish with all my power to aid and support Holy Church.\"[2421]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2421: _Ibid._, pp. 380, 381.]\r\n\r\nIn times of great need recourse was had to processions. \"Do you not\r\nwish,\" she was asked, \"that a fine and famous procession be ordained\r\nto restore you to a good estate if you be not therein?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, \"I desire the Church and all Catholics to pray for\r\nme.\"[2422]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2422: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 381.]\r\n\r\nAmong the doctors consulted there were many who recommended that she\r\nshould be again instructed and charitably admonished. On Wednesday,\r\nthe 2nd of May, sixty-three reverend doctors and masters met in the\r\nRobing Room of the castle.[2423] She was brought in, and Maitre Jean de\r\nCastillon, doctor in theology, Archdeacon of Evreux,[2424] read a\r\ndocument in French, in which the deeds and sayings with which Jeanne\r\nwas reproached were summed up in six articles. Then many doctors and\r\nmasters addressed to her in turn admonitions and charitable counsels.\r\nThey exhorted her to submit to the Church Militant Universal, to the\r\nHoly Father the Pope and to the General Council. They warned her that\r\nif the Church abandoned her, her soul would stand in great peril of\r\nthe penalty of eternal fire, whilst her body might be burned in an\r\nearthly fire, and that by the sentence of other judges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2423: _Ibid._, pp. 381, 382.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2424: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 114, 117.]\r\n\r\nJeanne replied as before.[2425] On the morrow, Thursday, the 3rd of\r\nMay, the day of the Invention of the Holy Cross, the Archangel Gabriel\r\nappeared to her. She was not sure whether she had seen him before. But\r\nthis time she had no doubt. Her Voices told her that it was he, and\r\nshe was greatly comforted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2425: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 383, 399.]\r\n\r\nThat same day she asked her Voices whether she should submit to the\r\nChurch and obey the exhortation of the clerics.\r\n\r\nHer Voices replied: \"If thou desirest help from Our Lord, then submit\r\nto him all thy doings.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne wanted to know from her Voices whether she would be burned.\r\n\r\nHer Voices told her to wait upon the Lord and he would help her.[2426]\r\nThis mystic aid strengthened Jeanne's heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2426: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 400, 401.]\r\n\r\nAmong heretics and those possessed, such obstinacy as hers was not\r\nunparalleled. Ecclesiastical judges were well acquainted with the\r\nstiff-neckedness of women who had been deceived by the Devil. In order\r\nto force them to tell the truth, when admonitions and exhortations\r\nfailed, recourse was had to torture. And even such a measure did not\r\nalways succeed. Many of these wicked females (_mulierculae_) endured\r\nthe cruellest suffering with a constancy passing the ordinary strength\r\nof human nature. The doctors would not believe such constancy to be\r\nnatural; they attributed it to the machinations of the Evil One. The\r\ndevil was capable of protecting his servants even when they had fallen\r\ninto the hands of judges of the Church; he granted them strength to\r\nbear the torture in silence. This strength was called the gift of\r\ntaciturnity.[2427]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2427: Nicolas Eymeric, _Directorium inquisitorium...._ Rome,\r\n1586, in fol. p. 24, col. 1. Ludovicus a Paramo, _De origine et\r\nprogressu officii sanctae inquisitionis_, MDXCIIX, in fol., lib. III,\r\nquestio 5, p. 709.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 9th of May, Jeanne was taken to the great tower of\r\nthe castle, into the torture-chamber. There my Lord of Beauvais, in\r\nthe presence of the Vice Inquisitor and nine doctors and masters,\r\nread her the articles, to which she had hitherto refused to reply; and\r\nhe threatened her that if she did not confess the whole truth she\r\nwould be put to the torture.[2428]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2428: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 399.]\r\n\r\nThe instruments were prepared; the two executioners, Mauger\r\nLeparmentier, a married clerk, and his companion, were in readiness\r\nclose by her, awaiting the Bishop's orders.\r\n\r\nSix days before Jeanne had received great comfort from her Voices. Now\r\nshe replied resolutely: \"Verily, if you were to tear my limbs asunder\r\nand drive my soul out of my body, naught else would I tell you, and if\r\nI did say anything unto you, I would always maintain afterwards that\r\nyou had dragged it from me by force.\"[2429]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2429: _Ibid._, pp. 399, 400.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord of Beauvais decided to defer the torture, fearing that it\r\nwould do no good to so hardened a subject.[2430] On the following\r\nSaturday, he deliberated in his house, with the Vice-Inquisitor and\r\nthirteen doctors and masters; opinion was divided. Maitre Raoul\r\nRoussel advised that Jeanne should not be tortured lest ground for\r\ncomplaint should be given against a trial so carefully conducted. It\r\nwould seem that he anticipated the Devil's granting Jeanne the gift of\r\ntaciturnity, whereby in diabolical silence she would be able to brave\r\nthe tortures of the Holy Inquisition. On the other hand Maitre Aubert\r\nMorel, licentiate in canon law, counsellor to the Official of Rouen,\r\nCanon of the Cathedral, and Maitre Thomas de Courcelles, deemed it\r\nexpedient to apply torture. Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur, master of arts,\r\nCanon of Rouen, whose share in the proceedings had been to act Saint\r\nCatherine and the Lorraine shoemaker, had no very decided opinion on\r\nthe subject, still it seemed to him by no means unprofitable that\r\nJeanne for her soul's welfare should be tortured. The majority of\r\ndoctors and masters agreed that for the present there was no need to\r\nsubject her to this trial. Some gave no reasons, others alleged that\r\nit behoved them yet once again to warn her charitably. Maitre\r\nGuillaume Erard, doctor in theology, held that sufficient material for\r\nthe pronouncing of a sentence existed already.[2431] Thus among those,\r\nwho spared Jeanne the torture, were to be found the least merciful;\r\nfor the spirit of ecclesiastical tribunals was such that to refuse to\r\ntorture an accused was in certain cases to refuse him mercy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2430: _Ibid._, pp. 401, 402.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2431: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 402, 404.]\r\n\r\nTo the trial of Marguerite la Porete, the judges summoned no\r\nexperts.[2432] Touching the charges held as proven, they submitted a\r\nwritten report to the University of Paris. The University gave its\r\nopinion on everything but the truth of the charges. This reservation\r\nwas merely formal, and the decision of the University had the force of\r\na sentence. In Jeanne's trial this precedent was cited. On the 21st of\r\nApril, Maitre Jean Beaupere, Maitre Jacques de Touraine and Maitre\r\nNicolas Midi left Rouen, and, at the risk of being attacked on the\r\nroad by men-at-arms, journeyed to Paris in order to present the twelve\r\narticles to their colleagues of the University.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2432: _Recueil des historiens de la France_, vol. xx, p. 601;\r\nvol. xxi, p. 34. _Histoire litteraire de la France_, vol. xxvii, p.\r\n70.]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April, the University, meeting in its general assembly\r\nat Saint-Bernard, charged the Holy Faculty of Theology and the\r\nVenerable Faculty of Decrees with the examination of the twelve\r\narticles.[2433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2433: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 407, 413, 420. M. Fournier, _La\r\nfaculte de decret de l'Universite de Paris_, p. 353. Le P. Denifle and\r\nChatelain, _Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis_, vol. iv, pp. 510\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May, the deliberations of the two Faculties were\r\nsubmitted to all the Faculties in solemn assembly, who ratified them\r\nand made them their own. The University then sent them to King Henry,\r\nbeseeching his Royal Majesty to execute justice promptly, in order\r\nthat the people, so greatly scandalised by this woman, be brought back\r\nto good doctrine and holy faith.[2434] It is worthy of notice that in a\r\ntrial, in which the Pope, represented by the Vice-Inquisitor, was one\r\njudge, and the King, represented by the Bishop, another, the Eldest\r\nDaughter of Kings[2435] should have communicated directly with the King\r\nof France, the guardian of her privileges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2434: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 407, 408. U. Chevalier,\r\n_L'abjuration de Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2435: The University of Paris (W.S.).]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Sacred Faculty of Theology, Jeanne's apparitions were\r\nfictitious, lying, deceptive, inspired by devils. The sign given to\r\nthe King was a presumptuous and pernicious lie, derogatory to the\r\ndignity of angels. Jeanne's belief in the visitations of Saint\r\nMichael, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret was an error rash and\r\ninjurious because Jeanne placed it on the same plane as the truths of\r\nreligion. Jeanne's predictions were but superstitions, idle\r\ndivinations and vain boasting. Her statement that she wore man's dress\r\nby the command of God was blasphemy, a violation of divine law and\r\necclesiastical sanction, a contemning of the sacraments and tainted\r\nwith idolatry. In the letters she had dictated, Jeanne appeared\r\ntreacherous, perfidious, cruel, sanguinary, seditious, blasphemous and\r\nin favour of tyranny. In setting out for France she had broken the\r\ncommandment to honour father and mother, she had given an occasion for\r\nscandal, she had committed blasphemy and had fallen from the faith. In\r\nthe leap from Beaurevoir, she had displayed a pusillanimity bordering\r\non despair and homicide; and, moreover, it had caused her to utter\r\nrash statements touching the remission of her sin and erroneous\r\npronouncements concerning free will. By proclaiming her confidence in\r\nher salvation, she uttered presumptuous and pernicious lies; by saying\r\nthat Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret did not speak English, she\r\nblasphemed these saints and violated the precept: \"Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbour.\" The honours she rendered these saints were nought but\r\nidolatry and the worship of devils. Her refusal to submit her doings\r\nto the Church tended to schism, to the denial of the unity and\r\nauthority of the Church and to apostasy.[2436]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2436: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 414, 419.]\r\n\r\nThe doctors of the Faculty of Theology were very learned. They knew\r\nwho the three evil spirits were whom Jeanne in her delusion took for\r\nSaint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. They were Belial,\r\nSatan, and Behemoth. Belial, worshipped by the people of Sidon, was\r\nsometimes represented as an angel of great beauty; he is the demon of\r\ndisobedience. Satan is the Lord of Hell; and Behemoth is a dull, heavy\r\ncreature, who feeds on hay like an ox.[2437]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2437: _Ibid._, p. 414. Migne, _Dictionnaire des sciences\r\noccultes_.]\r\n\r\nThe venerable Faculty of Decrees decided that this schismatic, this\r\nerring woman, this apostate, this liar, this soothsayer, be charitably\r\nexhorted and duly warned by competent judges, and that if\r\nnotwithstanding she persisted in refusing to abjure her error, she\r\nmust be given up to the secular arm to receive due chastisement.[2438]\r\nSuch were the deliberations and decisions which the Venerable\r\nUniversity of Paris submitted to the examination and to the verdict of\r\nthe Holy Apostolic See and of the sacrosanct General Council.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2438: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 417, 420.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, where were the clerks of France? Had they nothing to say in\r\nthis matter? Had they no decision to submit to the Pope and to the\r\nCouncil? Why did they not urge their opinions in opposition to those\r\nof the Faculties of Paris? Why did they keep silence? Jeanne demanded\r\nthe record of the Poitiers trial. Wherefore did those Poitiers\r\ndoctors, who had recommended the King to employ the Maid lest, by\r\nrejecting her, he should refuse the gift of the Holy Spirit, fail to\r\nsend the record to Rouen?[2439] Before the Maid espoused their waning\r\ncause, these Poitiers doctors, these magistrates, these University\r\nprofessors banished from Paris, advocates and counsellors of an exiled\r\nParlement, had not a robe to their backs nor shoes for their children.\r\nNow, thanks to the Maid, they were every day regaining new hope and\r\nvigour. And yet they left her, who had so nobly served their King, to\r\nbe treated as a heretic and a reprobate. Where were Brother Pasquerel,\r\nFriar Richard, and all those churchmen who but lately surrounded her\r\nin France and who looked to go with her to the Crusade against the\r\nBohemians and the Turks? Why did they not demand a safe-conduct and\r\ncome and give evidence at the trial? Or at least why did they not send\r\ntheir evidence? Why did not the Archbishop of Embrun, who but recently\r\ngave such noble counsels to the King, send some written statement in\r\nfavour of the Maid to the judges at Rouen? My Lord of Reims,\r\nChancellor of the Kingdom, had said that she was proud but not\r\nheretical. Wherefore now, acting contrary to his own interests and\r\nhonour, did he refrain from testifying in favour of her through whom\r\nhe had recovered his episcopal city? Wherefore did he not assert his\r\nright and do his duty as metropolitan and censure and suspend his\r\nsuffragan, the Bishop of Beauvais, who was guilty of prevarication in\r\nthe administration of justice? Why did not the illustrious clerics,\r\nwhom King Charles had appointed deputies at the Council of Bale,\r\nundertake to bring the cause of the Maid before the Council? And\r\nfinally, why did not the priests, the ecclesiastics of the realm, with\r\none voice demand an appeal to the Holy Father?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2439: From a theological point of view the record of the\r\nPoitiers trial may have been insignificant; but at any rate it\r\ncontained the arguments presented to the King and the memoranda of\r\nGelu and of Gerson.]\r\n\r\nThey all with one accord, as if struck dumb with astonishment,\r\nremained passive and silent. Can they have feared that too searching a\r\nlight would be cast on Jeanne's cause by that illustrious University,\r\nthat Sun of the Church, which was consulted on religious matters by\r\nall Christian states? Can they have suspected that this woman, who in\r\nFrance had been considered a saint, might after all have been inspired\r\nby the devil? But if what they had once believed they still held to be\r\ntrue, if they believed that the Maid had come from God to lead their\r\nKing to his glorious coronation, then what are we to think of those\r\nclerks, those ecclesiastics who denied the Daughter of God, on the eve\r\nof her passion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE ABJURATION--THE FIRST SENTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 19th of May, the doctors and masters, to the number\r\nof fifty, assembled in the archiepiscopal chapel of Rouen. There they\r\nunanimously declared their agreement with the decision of the\r\nUniversity of Paris; and my Lord of Beauvais ordained that a new\r\ncharitable admonition be addressed to Jeanne.[2440] Accordingly, on\r\nWednesday the 23rd, the Bishop, the Vice-Inquisitor, and the Promoter\r\nwent to a room in the castle, near Jeanne's cell. They were\r\naccompanied by seven doctors and masters, by the Lord Bishop of Noyon\r\nand by the Lord Bishop of Therouanne.[2441] The latter, brother to\r\nMessire Jean de Luxembourg who had sold the Maid, was held one of the\r\nmost notable personages of the Great Council of England; he was\r\nChancellor of France for King Henry, as Messire Regnault de Chartres\r\nwas for King Charles.[2442]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2440: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 404, 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2441: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 429, 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2442: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 126-127.]\r\n\r\nThe accused was brought in, and Maitre Pierre Maurice, doctor in\r\ntheology, read to her the twelve articles as they had been abridged\r\nand commented upon, in conformity with the deliberations of the\r\nUniversity; the whole was drawn up as a discourse addressed to Jeanne\r\ndirectly:[2443]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2443: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 430.]\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE I\r\n\r\n     First, Jeanne, thou saidst that at about the age of\r\n     thirteen, thou didst receive revelations and behold\r\n     apparitions of angels and of the Saints, Catherine and\r\n     Margaret, that thou didst behold them frequently with thy\r\n     bodily eyes, that they spoke unto thee and do still\r\n     oftentimes speak unto thee, and that they have said unto\r\n     thee many things that thou hast fully declared in thy trial.\r\n\r\n     The clerks of the University of Paris and others have\r\n     considered the manner of these revelations and apparitions,\r\n     their object, the substance of the things revealed, the\r\n     person to whom they were revealed; all points touching them\r\n     have they considered. And now they pronounce these\r\n     revelations and apparitions to be either lying fictions,\r\n     deceptive and dangerous, or superstitions, proceeding from\r\n     spirits evil and devilish.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE II\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that thy King received a sign, by which\r\n     he knew that thou wast sent of God: to wit that Saint\r\n     Michael, accompanied by a multitude of angels, certain of\r\n     whom had wings, others crowns, and with whom were Saint\r\n     Catherine and Saint Margaret, came to thee in the town of\r\n     Chateau-Chinon; and that they all entered with thee and went\r\n     up the staircase of the castle, into the chamber of thy\r\n     King, before whom the angel who wore the crown made\r\n     obeisance. And once didst thou say that this crown which\r\n     thou callest a sign, was delivered to the Archbishop of\r\n     Reims who gave it to thy King, in the presence of a\r\n     multitude of princes and lords whom thou didst call by name.\r\n\r\n     Now concerning this sign, the aforesaid clerks declare it to\r\n     lack verisimilitude, to be a presumptuous lie, deceptive,\r\n     pernicious, a thing counterfeited and attacking the dignity\r\n     of angels.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE III\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that thou knewest the angels and the\r\n     saints by the good counsel, the comfort and the instruction\r\n     they gave thee, because they told thee their names and\r\n     because the saints saluted thee. Thou didst believe also\r\n     that it was Saint Michael who appeared unto thee; and that\r\n     the deeds and sayings of this angel and these saints are\r\n     good thou didst believe as firmly as thou believest in\r\n     Christ.\r\n\r\n     Now the clerks declare such signs to be insufficient for the\r\n     recognition of the said saints and angels. The clerks\r\n     maintain that thou hast lightly believed and rashly\r\n     affirmed, and further that when thou sayst thou dost believe\r\n     as firmly etc., thou dost err from the faith.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IV\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said thou art assured of certain things\r\n     which are to come, that thou hast known hidden things, that\r\n     thou hast also recognized men whom thou hadst never seen\r\n     before, and this by the Voices of Saint Catherine and Saint\r\n     Margaret.\r\n\r\n     Thereupon the clerks declare that in these sayings are\r\n     superstition, divination, presumptuous assertion and vain\r\n     boasting.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE V\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that by God's command and according to\r\n     his will, thou hast worn and dost still wear man's apparel.\r\n     Because thou hast God's commandment to wear this dress thou\r\n     hast donned a short tunic, jerkin, and hose with many\r\n     points. Thou dost even wear thy hair cut short above the\r\n     ears, without keeping about thee anything to denote the\r\n     feminine sex, save what nature hath given thee. And\r\n     oftentimes hast thou in this garb received the Sacrament of\r\n     the Eucharist. And albeit thou hast been many times\r\n     admonished to leave it, thou wouldest not, saying that thou\r\n     wouldst liefer die than quit this apparel, unless it were by\r\n     God's command; and that if thou wert still in this dress and\r\n     with those of thine own party it would be for the great weal\r\n     of France. Thou sayest also that for nothing wouldst thou\r\n     take an oath not to wear this dress and bear these arms; and\r\n     for all this that thou doest thou dost plead divine command.\r\n\r\n     In such matters the clerks declare that thou blasphemest\r\n     against God, despising him and his Sacraments, that thou\r\n     dost transgress divine law, Holy Scripture and the canons of\r\n     the Church, that thou thinkest evil and dost err from the\r\n     faith, that thou art full of vain boasting, that thou art\r\n     addicted to idolatry and worship of thyself and thy clothes,\r\n     according to the customs of the heathen.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VI\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast often said, that in thy letters thou hast\r\n     put these names, _Jhesus Maria_, and the sign of the cross,\r\n     to warn those to whom thou didst write not to do what was\r\n     indicated in the letter. In other letters thou hast boasted\r\n     that thou wouldst slay all those who did not obey thee, and\r\n     that by thy blows thou wouldst prove who had God on his\r\n     side. Also hast thou oftentimes said that all thy deeds were\r\n     by revelation and according to divine command.\r\n\r\n     Touching such affirmations the clerks declare thee to be a\r\n     traitor, perfidious, cruel, desiring human bloodshed,\r\n     seditious, an instigator of tyranny, a blasphemer of God's\r\n     commandments and revelations.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VII\r\n\r\n     Item, thou sayest that according to revelations vouchsafed\r\n     unto thee at the age of seventeen, thou didst leave thy\r\n     parents' house against their will, driving them almost mad.\r\n     Thou didst go to Robert de Baudricourt, who, at thy\r\n     request, gave thee man's apparel and a sword, also\r\n     men-at-arms to take thee to thy King. And being come to the\r\n     King, thou didst say unto him that his enemies should be\r\n     driven away, thou didst promise to bring him into a great\r\n     kingdom, to make him victorious over his foes, and that for\r\n     this God had sent thee. These things thou sayest thou didst\r\n     accomplish in obedience to God and according to revelation.\r\n\r\n     In such things the clerks declare thee to have been\r\n     irreverent to thy father and mother, thus disobeying God's\r\n     command; to have given occasion for scandal, to have\r\n     blasphemed, to have erred from the faith and to have made a\r\n     rash and presumptuous promise.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VIII\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said, that voluntarily thou didst leap from\r\n     the Tower of Beaurevoir, preferring rather to die than to be\r\n     delivered into the hands of the English and to live after\r\n     the destruction of Compiegne. And albeit Saint Catherine and\r\n     Saint Margaret forbade thee to leap, thou couldst not\r\n     restrain thyself. And despite the great sin thou hast\r\n     committed in offending these saints, thou didst know by thy\r\n     Voices, that after thy confession, thy sin was forgiven\r\n     thee.\r\n\r\n     This deed the clerks declare thee to have committed through\r\n     cowardice turning to despair and probably to suicide. In\r\n     this matter likewise thou didst utter a rash and\r\n     presumptuous statement in asserting that thy sin is\r\n     forgiven, and thou dost err from the faith touching the\r\n     doctrine of free will.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IX\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret\r\n     promised to lead thee to Paradise provided thou didst remain\r\n     a virgin; and that thou hadst vowed and promised them to\r\n     cherish thy virginity, and of that thou art as well assured\r\n     as if already thou hadst entered into the glory of the\r\n     Blessed. Thou believest that thou hast not committed mortal\r\n     sin. And it seemeth to thee that if thou wert in mortal sin\r\n     the saints would not visit thee daily as they do.\r\n\r\n     Such an assertion the clerks pronounce to be a pernicious\r\n     lie, presumptuous and rash, that therein lieth a\r\n     contradiction of what thou hadst previously said, and that\r\n     finally thy beliefs do err from the true Christian faith.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE X\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast declared it to be within thy knowledge that\r\n     God loveth certain living persons better than thee, and that\r\n     this thou hast learnt by revelation from Saint Catherine and\r\n     Saint Margaret: also that those saints speak French, not\r\n     English, since they are not on the side of the English. And\r\n     when thou knewest that thy Voices were for thy King, you\r\n     didst fall to disliking the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n     Such matters the clerks pronounce to be a rash and\r\n     presumptuous assertion, a superstitious divination, a\r\n     blasphemy uttered against Saint Catherine and Saint\r\n     Margaret, and a transgression of the commandment to love our\r\n     neighbours.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XI\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that to those whom thou callest Saint\r\n     Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret, thou didst do\r\n     reverence, bending the knee, taking off thy cap, kissing the\r\n     ground on which they trod, vowing to them thy virginity:\r\n     that in the instruction of these saints, whom thou didst\r\n     invoke and kiss and embrace, thou didst believe as soon as\r\n     they appeared unto thee, and without seeking counsel from\r\n     thy priest or from any other ecclesiastic. And,\r\n     notwithstanding, thou believest that these Voices came from\r\n     God as firmly as thou believest in the Christian religion\r\n     and the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Moreover thou hast\r\n     said that did any evil spirit appear to thee in the form of\r\n     Saint Michael thou wouldest know such a spirit and\r\n     distinguish him from the saint. And again hast thou said,\r\n     that of thine own accord, thou hast sworn not to reveal the\r\n     sign thou gavest to thy King. And finally thou didst add:\r\n     \"Save at God's command.\"\r\n\r\n     Now touching these matters, the clerks affirm that supposing\r\n     thou hast had the revelations and beheld the apparitions of\r\n     which thou boastest and in such a manner as thou dost say,\r\n     then art thou an idolatress, an invoker of demons, an\r\n     apostate from the faith, a maker of rash statements, a\r\n     swearer of an unlawful oath.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XII\r\n\r\n     Item, thou hast said that if the Church wished thee to\r\n     disobey the orders thou sayest God gave thee, nothing would\r\n     induce thee to do it; that thou knowest that all the deeds\r\n     of which thou hast been accused in thy trial were wrought\r\n     according to the command of God and that it was impossible\r\n     for thee to do otherwise. Touching these deeds, thou dost\r\n     refuse to submit to the judgment of the Church on earth or\r\n     of any living man, and will submit therein to God alone. And\r\n     moreover thou didst declare this reply itself not to be made\r\n     of thine own accord but by God's command; despite the\r\n     article of faith: _Unam sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam_,\r\n     having been many times declared unto thee, and\r\n     notwithstanding that it behoveth all Christians to submit\r\n     their deeds and sayings to the Church militant especially\r\n     concerning revelations and such like matters.\r\n\r\n     Wherefore the clerks declare thee to be schismatic,\r\n     disbelieving in the unity and authority of the Church,\r\n     apostate and obstinately erring from the faith.[2444]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2444: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 430, 437.]\r\n\r\nHaving completed the reading of the articles, Maitre Pierre Maurice,\r\non the invitation of the Bishop, proceeded to exhort Jeanne. He had\r\nbeen rector of the University of Paris in 1428.[2445] He was esteemed\r\nan orator. He it was who, on the 5th of June, had discoursed in the\r\nname of the chapter, before King Henry VI on the occasion of his\r\nentering Rouen. He would seem to have been distinguished by some\r\nknowledge of and taste for ancient letters, and to have been possessed\r\nof precious manuscripts, amongst which were the comedies of Terence\r\nand the _AEneid_ of Virgil.[2446]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2445: Du Boulay, _Historia Universitatis Parisiensis_, vol.\r\nv, p. 929.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2446: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, p. 88.]\r\n\r\nIn terms of calculated simplicity did this illustrious doctor call\r\nupon Jeanne to reflect on the effects of her words and sayings, and\r\ntenderly did he exhort her to submit to the Church. After the wormwood\r\nhe offered her the honey; he spoke to her in words kind and familiar.\r\nWith remarkable adroitness he entered into the feelings and\r\ninclinations of the maiden's heart. Seeing her filled with knightly\r\nenthusiasm and loyalty to King Charles, whose coronation was her\r\ndoing, he drew his comparisons from chivalry, thereby essaying to\r\nprove to her that she ought rather to believe in the Church Militant\r\nthan in her Voices and apparitions.\r\n\r\n\"If your King,\" he said to her, \"had appointed you to defend a\r\nfortress, forbidding you to let any one enter it, would you not refuse\r\nto admit whomsoever claiming to come from him did not present letters\r\nand some other token. Likewise, when Our Lord Jesus Christ, on his\r\nascension into heaven, committed to the Blessed Apostle Peter and to\r\nhis successors the government of his Church, he forbade them to\r\nreceive such as claimed to come in his name but brought no\r\ncredentials.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, to bring home to her how grievous a sin it was to disobey the\r\nChurch, he recalled the time when she waged war, and put the case of a\r\nknight who should disobey his king:\r\n\r\n\"When you were in your King's dominion,\" he said to her, \"if a knight\r\nor some other owing fealty to him had arisen, saying, 'I will not obey\r\nthe King; I will not submit either to him or to his officers,' would\r\nyou not have said, 'He is a man to be censured'? What say you then of\r\nyourself, you who, engendered in Christ's religion, having become by\r\nbaptism the daughter of the Church and the bride of Christ, dost now\r\nrefuse obedience to the officers of Christ, that is, to the prelates\r\nof the Church?\"[2447]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2447: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 437, 441.]\r\n\r\nThus did Maitre Pierre Maurice endeavour to make Jeanne understand\r\nhim. He did not succeed. Against the courage of this child all the\r\nreasons and all the eloquence of the world would have availed nothing.\r\nWhen Maitre Pierre had finished speaking, Jeanne, being asked whether\r\nshe did not hold herself bound to submit her deeds and sayings to the\r\nChurch, replied:\r\n\r\n\"What I have always held and said in the trial that will I\r\nmaintain.... If I were condemned and saw the fagots lighted, and the\r\nexecutioner ready to stir the fire, and I in the fire, I would say and\r\nmaintain till I died nought other than what I said during the trial.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the Bishop declared the discussion at an end, and\r\ndeferred the pronouncing of the sentence till the morrow.[2448]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2448: _Ibid._, pp. 441, 442.]\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Thursday after Whitsuntide and the 24th day of May,\r\nearly in the morning, Maitre Jean Beaupere visited Jeanne in her\r\nprison and warned her that she would be shortly taken to the scaffold\r\nto hear a sermon.\r\n\r\n\"If you are a good Christian,\" he said, \"you will agree to submit all\r\nyour deeds and sayings to Holy Mother Church, and especially to the\r\necclesiastical judges.\"\r\n\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere thought he heard her reply, \"So I will.\"[2449]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2449: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 21.]\r\n\r\nIf such were her answer, then it must have been because, worn out by a\r\nflight of agony, her physical courage quailed at the thought of death\r\nby burning.\r\n\r\nJust when he was leaving her, as she stood near a door, Maitre Nicolas\r\nLoiseleur gave her the same advice, and in order to induce her to\r\nfollow it, he made her a false promise:\r\n\r\n\"Jeanne, believe me,\" he said. \"You have your deliverance in your own\r\nhands. Wear the apparel of your sex, and do what shall be required of\r\nyou. Otherwise you stand in danger of death. If you do as I tell you,\r\ngood will come to you and no harm. You will be delivered into the\r\nhands of the Church.\"[2450]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2450: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 146. De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur\r\nles juges_, pp. 445 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nShe was taken in a cart and with an armed guard to that part of the\r\ntown called Bourg-l'Abbe, lying beneath the castle walls. And but a\r\nshort distance away the cart was stopped, in the cemetery of\r\nSaint-Ouen, also called _les aitres[2451] Saint-Ouen_. Here a highly\r\npopular fair was held every year on the feast day of the patron saint\r\nof the Abbey.[2452] Here it was that Jeanne was to hear the sermon, as\r\nso many other unhappy creatures had done before her. Places like this,\r\nto which the folk could flock in crowds, were generally chosen for\r\nthese edifying spectacles. On the border of this vast charnel-house\r\nfor a hundred years there had towered a parish church, and on the\r\nsouth there rose the nave of the abbey. Against the magnificent\r\nedifice of the church two scaffolds had been erected,[2453] one large,\r\nthe other smaller. They were west of the porch which was called\r\n_portail des Marmousets_, because of the multitudes of tiny figures\r\ncarved upon it.[2454]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2451: Old name for a cemetery close to a church. Godefroy,\r\n_Lexique de l'ancien francais_ (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2452: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2453: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2454: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur le cimetiere de Saint-Ouen\r\nde Rouen_, in _Precis analytique des travaux de l'Academie de Rouen_\r\n1875-1876, pp. 211, 230, plan.

Sarrazin, _Jeanne\r\nd'Arc et la Normandie_, p. 351.]\r\n\r\nOn the great scaffold the two judges, the Lord Bishop and the\r\nVice-Inquisitor, took their places. They were assisted by the most\r\nreverend Cardinal of Winchester, the Lord Bishops of Therouanne, of\r\nNoyon, and of Norwich, the Lord Abbots of Fecamp, of Jumieges, of Bec,\r\nof Corneilles, of Mont-Saint-Michel-au-Peril-de-la-Mer, of Mortemart,\r\nof Preaux, and of Saint-Ouen of Rouen, where the assembly was held,\r\nthe Priors of Longueville and of Saint-Lo, also many doctors and\r\nbachelors in theology, doctors and licentiates in canon and civil\r\nlaw.[2455] Likewise were there many high personages of the English\r\nparty. The other scaffold was a kind of pulpit. To it ascended the\r\ndoctor who, according to the use and custom of the Holy Inquisition\r\nwas to preach the sermon against Jeanne. He was Maitre Guillaume\r\nErard, doctor in theology, canon of the churches of Langres and of\r\nBeauvais.[2456] At this time he was very eager to go to Flanders, where\r\nhe was urgently needed; and he confided to his young servitor,\r\nBrother Jean de Lenisoles, that the preaching of this sermon caused\r\nhim great inconvenience. \"I want to be in Flanders,\" he said. \"This\r\naffair is very annoying for me.\"[2457]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2455: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 442, 444. O'Reilly, _Les deux\r\nproces_, vol. i, pp. 70-93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2456: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 402, 408.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2457: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 113.]\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view, however, he must have been pleased to perform\r\nthis duty, since it afforded him the opportunity of attacking the King\r\nof France, Charles VII, and of thereby showing his devotion to the\r\nEnglish cause, to which he was strongly attached.\r\n\r\nJeanne, dressed as a man, was brought up and placed at his side,\r\nbefore all the people.[2458]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2458: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 469, 470.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume Erard began his sermon in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"I take as my text the words of God in the Gospel of Saint John,\r\nchapter xv: 'The branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide\r\nin the vine.'[2459] Thus it behoveth all Catholics to remain abiding in\r\nHoly Mother Church, the true vine, which the hand of Our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist hath planted. Now this Jeanne, whom you see before you, falling\r\nfrom error into error, and from crime into crime, hath become separate\r\nfrom the unity of Holy Mother Church and in a thousand manners hath\r\nscandalised Christian people.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2459: _Ibid._, p. 444. E. Richer, _Histoire manuscrite de la\r\nPucelle d'Orleans_, bk. i, fol. 8; bk. ii, fol. 198, v'o.]\r\n\r\nThen he reproached her with having failed, with having sinned against\r\nroyal Majesty and against God and the Catholic Faith; and all these\r\nthings must she henceforth eschew under pain of death by burning.\r\n\r\nHe declaimed vehemently against the pride of this woman. He said that\r\nnever had there appeared in France a monster so great as that which\r\nwas manifest in Jeanne; that she was a witch, a heretic, a schismatic,\r\nand that the King, who protected her, risked the same reproach from\r\nthe moment that he became willing to recover his throne with the help\r\nof such a heretic.[2460]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2460: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of his sermon, he cried out with a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! right terribly hast thou been deceived, noble house of France,\r\nonce the most Christian of houses! Charles, who calls himself thy head\r\nand assumes the title of King hath, like a heretic and schismatic,\r\nreceived the words of an infamous woman, abounding in evil works and\r\nin all dishonour. And not he alone, but all the clergy in his lordship\r\nand dominion, by whom this woman, so she sayeth, hath been examined\r\nand not rejected. Full sore is the pity of it.\"[2461]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2461: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 15, 17.]\r\n\r\nTwo or three times did Maitre Guillaume repeat these words concerning\r\nKing Charles. Then pointing at Jeanne with his finger he said:\r\n\r\n\"It is to you, Jeanne, that I speak; and I say unto you that your King\r\nis a heretic and a schismatic.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words Jeanne was deeply wounded in her love for the Lilies of\r\nFrance and for King Charles. She was moved with great feeling, and she\r\nheard her Voices saying unto her:\r\n\r\n\"Reply boldly to the preacher who is preaching to you.\"[2462]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2462: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 456, 457. U. Chevalier,\r\n_L'abjuration de Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 46, 47.]\r\n\r\nThen obeying them heartily, she interrupted Maitre Jean:\r\n\r\n\"By my troth, Messire,\" she said to him, \"saving your reverence, I\r\ndare say unto you and swear at the risk of my life, that he is the\r\nnoblest Christian of all Christians, that none loveth better religion\r\nand the Church, and that he is not at all what you say.\"[2463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2463: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 15, 17, 335, 345, 353, 367.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume ordered the Usher, Jean Massieu, to silence her.[2464]\r\nThen he went on with his sermon, and concluded with these words:\r\n\"Jeanne, behold my Lords the Judges, who oftentimes have summoned you\r\nand required you to submit all your acts and sayings to Mother Church.\r\nIn these acts and sayings were many things which, so it seemed to\r\nthese clerics, were good neither to say nor to maintain.\"[2465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2464: _Ibid._, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2465: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 444, 445.]\r\n\r\n\"I will answer you,\" said Jeanne. Touching the article of submission\r\nto the Church, she recalled how she had asked for all the deeds she\r\nhad wrought and the words she had uttered to be reported to Rome, to\r\nOur Holy Father the Pope, to whom, after God, she appealed. Then she\r\nadded: \"And as for the sayings I have uttered and the deeds I have\r\ndone, they have all been by God's command.\"[2466]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2466: _Ibid._, p. 445.]\r\n\r\nShe declared that she had not understood that the record of her trial\r\nwas being sent to Rome to be judged by the Pope.\r\n\r\n\"I will not have it thus,\" she said. \"I know not what you will insert\r\nin the record of these proceedings. I demand to be taken to the Pope\r\nand questioned by him.\"[2467]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2467: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 358.]\r\n\r\nThey urged her to incriminate her King. But they wasted their breath.\r\n\r\n\"For my deeds and sayings I hold no man responsible, neither my King\r\nnor another.\"[2468]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2468: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 445.]\r\n\r\n\"Will you abjure all your deeds and sayings? Will you abjure such of\r\nyour deeds and sayings as have been condemned by the clerks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to God and to Our Holy Father, the Pope.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not sufficient. We cannot go so far to seek the Pope.\r\nEach Ordinary is judge in his own diocese. Wherefore it is needful for\r\nyou to appeal to Our Holy Mother Church, and to hold as true all that\r\nclerks and folks well learned in the matter say and determine touching\r\nyour actions and your sayings.\"[2469]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2469: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 445, 446.]\r\n\r\nAdmonished with yet a third admonition, Jeanne refused to recant.[2470]\r\nWith confidence she awaited the deliverance promised by her Voices,\r\ncertain that of a sudden there would come men-at-arms from France and\r\nthat in one great tumult of fighting-men and angels she would be\r\nliberated. That was why she had insisted on retaining man's attire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2470: _Ibid._, p. 446.]\r\n\r\nTwo sentences had been prepared: one for the case in which the accused\r\nshould abjure her error, the other for the case in which she should\r\npersevere. By the first there was removed from Jeanne the ban of\r\nexcommunication. By the second, the tribunal, declaring that it could\r\ndo nothing more for her, abandoned her to the secular arm. The Lord\r\nBishop had them both with him.[2471]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2471: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nHe took the second and began to read: \"In the name of the Lord, Amen.\r\nAll the pastors of the Church who have it in their hearts faithfully\r\nto tend their flocks....\"[2472]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2472: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 473.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as he read, the clerks who were round Jeanne urged her to\r\nrecant, while there was yet time. Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur exhorted\r\nher to do as he had recommended, and to put on woman's dress.[2473]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2473: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume Erard was saying: \"Do as you are advised and you will\r\nbe delivered from prison.\"[2474]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2474: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 17, 331; vol. iii, pp. 52, 156.]\r\n\r\nThen straightway came the Voices unto her and said: \"Jeanne, passing\r\nsore is our pity for you! You must recant what you have said, or we\r\nabandon you to secular justice.... Jeanne, do as you are advised.\r\nJeanne, will you bring death upon yourself!\"[2475]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2475: _Ibid._, p. 123.]\r\n\r\nThe sentence was long and the Lord Bishop read slowly:\r\n\r\n     \"We judges, having Christ before our eyes and also the\r\n     honour of the true faith, in order that our judgment may\r\n     proceed from the Lord himself, do say and decree that thou\r\n     hast been a liar, an inventor of revelations and apparitions\r\n     said to be divine; a deceiver, pernicious, presumptuous,\r\n     light of faith, rash, superstitious, a soothsayer, a\r\n     blasphemer against God and his saints. We declare thee to be\r\n     a contemner of God even in his sacraments, a prevaricator of\r\n     divine law, of sacred doctrine and of ecclesiastical\r\n     sanction, seditious, cruel, apostate, schismatic, having\r\n     committed a thousand errors against religion, and by all\r\n     these tokens rashly guilty towards God and Holy\r\n     Church.[2476]\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2476: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 474, 475.]\r\n\r\nTime was passing. Already the Lord Bishop had uttered the greater part\r\nof the sentence.[2477] The executioner was there, ready to take off the\r\ncondemned in his cart.[2478]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2477: _Ibid._, p. 473 note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2478: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 65, 147, 149, 273. De\r\nBeaurepaire, _Recherches sur le proces_, p. 358.]\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, with hands clasped, Jeanne cried that she was willing\r\nto obey the Church.[2479]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2479: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 323.]\r\n\r\nThe judge paused in the reading of the sentence.\r\n\r\nAn uproar arose in the crowd, consisting largely of English\r\nmen-at-arms and officers of King Henry. Ignorant of the customs of the\r\nInquisition, which had not been introduced into their country, these\r\n_Godons_ could not understand what was going on; all they knew was\r\nthat the witch was saved. Now they held Jeanne's death to be necessary\r\nfor the welfare of England; wherefore the unaccountable actions of\r\nthese doctors and the Lord Bishop threw them into a fury. In their\r\nIsland witches were not treated thus; no mercy was shown them, and\r\nthey were burned speedily. Angry murmurs arose; stones were thrown at\r\nthe registrars of the trial.[2480] Maitre Pierre Maurice, who was doing\r\nhis best to strengthen Jeanne in the resolution she had taken, was\r\nthreatened and the _coues_ very nearly made short work with him.[2481]\r\nNeither did Maitre Jean Beaupere and the delegates from the University\r\nof Paris escape their share of the insults. They were accused of\r\nfavouring Jeanne's errors.[2482] Who better than they knew the\r\ninjustice of these reproaches?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2480: _Ibid._, pp. 137, 376.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2481: _Ibid._, p. 356; vol. iii, pp. 157, 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2482: _Ibid._, p. 55.]\r\n\r\nCertain of the high personages sitting on the platform at the side of\r\nthe judge complained to the Lord Bishop that he had not gone on to the\r\nend of the sentence but had admitted Jeanne to repentance.\r\n\r\nHe was even reproached with insults, for one was heard to cry: \"You\r\nshall pay for this.\"\r\n\r\nHe threatened to suspend the trial.\r\n\r\n\"I have been insulted,\" he said. \"I will proceed no further until\r\nhonourable amends have been done me.\"[2483]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2483: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 90, 147, 156.]\r\n\r\nIn the tumult, Maitre Guillaume Erard unfolded a double sheet of\r\npaper, and read Jeanne the form of abjuration, written down according\r\nto the opinion of the masters. It was no longer than the Lord's Prayer\r\nand consisted of six or seven lines of writing. It was in French and\r\nbegan with these words: \"I, Jeanne....\" The Maid submitted therein to\r\nthe sentence, the judgment, and the commandment of the Church; she\r\nacknowledged having committed the crime of high treason and having\r\ndeceived the people. She undertook never again to bear arms or to wear\r\nman's dress or her hair cut round her ears.[2484]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2484: _Ibid._, pp. 52, 65, 132, 156, 197. U. Chevalier,\r\n_L'Abjuration de Jeanne d'Arc_.]\r\n\r\nWhen Maitre Guillaume had read the document, Jeanne declared she did\r\nnot understand it, and wished to be advised thereupon.[2485] She was\r\nheard to ask counsel of Saint Michael.[2486] She still believed firmly\r\nin her Voices, albeit they had not aided her in her dire necessity,\r\nneither had spared her the shame of denying them. For, simple as she\r\nwas, at the bottom of her heart she knew well what the clerks were\r\nasking of her; she realised that they would not let her go until she\r\nhad pronounced a great recantation. All that she said was merely in\r\norder to gain time and because she was afraid of death; yet she could\r\nnot bring herself to lie.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2485: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 156, 157 (evidence of Jean\r\nMassieu, Usher of the court).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2486: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 323.]\r\n\r\nWithout losing a moment Maitre Guillaume said to Messire Jean\r\nMassieu, the Usher: \"Advise her touching this abjuration.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he passed him the document.[2487]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2487: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 157.]\r\n\r\nMessire Jean Massieu at first made excuse, but afterwards he complied\r\nand warned Jeanne of the danger she was running by her refusal to\r\nrecant.\r\n\r\n\"You must know,\" he said, \"that if you oppose any of these articles\r\nyou will be burned. I counsel you to appeal to the Church Universal as\r\nto whether you should abjure these articles or not.\"\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume Erard asked Jean Massieu: \"Well, what are you saying\r\nto her?\"\r\n\r\nJean Massieu replied: \"I make known unto Jeanne the text of the deed\r\nof abjuration and I urge her to sign it. But she declares that she\r\nknoweth not whether she will.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Jeanne, who was still being pressed to sign, said\r\naloud: \"I wish the Church to deliberate on the articles. I appeal to\r\nthe Church Universal as to whether I should abjure them. Let the\r\ndocument be read by the Church and the clerks into whose hands I am to\r\nbe delivered. If it be their counsel that I ought to sign it and do\r\nwhat I am told, then willingly will I do it.\"[2488]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2488: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 331; vol. iii, p. 157. This deed,\r\nwritten in a large hand and containing but a few lines, appears to be\r\nan abridgment of that contained in the _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 447, 448\r\n(cf. vol. iii, pp. 156, 197).]\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume Erard replied: \"Do it now, or you will be burned this\r\nvery day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he forbade Jean Massieu to confer with her any longer.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Jeanne said that she would liefer sign than be burned.[2489]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2489: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 156, 197.]\r\n\r\nThen straightway Messire Jean Massieu gave her a second reading of the\r\ndeed of abjuration. And she repeated the words after the Usher. As she\r\nspoke her countenance seemed to express a kind of sneer. It may have\r\nbeen that her features were contracted by the violent emotions which\r\nswayed her and that the horrors and tortures of an ecclesiastical\r\ntrial may have overclouded her reason, subject at all times to strange\r\nvagaries, and that after such bitter suffering there may have come\r\nupon her the actual paroxysm of madness. On the other hand it may have\r\nbeen that with sound sense and calm mind she was mocking at the clerks\r\nof Rouen; she was quite capable of it, for she had mocked at the\r\nclerks of Poitiers. At any rate she had a jesting air, and the\r\nbystanders noticed that she pronounced the words of her abjuration\r\nwith a smile.[2490] And her gaiety, whether real or apparent, roused\r\nthe wrath of those burgesses, priests, artisans, and men-at-arms who\r\ndesired her death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2490: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 338; vol. iii, p. 147.]\r\n\r\n\"'Tis all a mockery. Jeanne doth but jest,\"[2491] they cried.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2491: _Ibid._, pp. 55, 143.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most irate was Master Lawrence Calot, Secretary to the King\r\nof England. He was seen to be in a violent rage and to approach first\r\nthe judge and then the accused. A noble of Picardy who was present,\r\nthe very same who had essayed familiarities with Jeanne in the Castle\r\nof Beaurevoir, thought he saw this Englishman forcing Jeanne to sign a\r\npaper.[2492] He was mistaken. In every crowd there are those who see\r\nthings that never happen. The Bishop would not have permitted such a\r\nthing; he was devoted to the Regent, but on a question of form he\r\nwould never have given way. Meanwhile, under this storm of insults,\r\namidst the throwing of stones and the clashing of swords, these\r\nillustrious masters, these worthy doctors grew pale. The Prior of\r\nLongueville was awaiting an opportunity to make an apology to the\r\nCardinal of Winchester.[2493]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2492: _Ibid._, p. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2493: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 361. J. Quicherat, _Apercus\r\nnouveaux_, p. 135.]\r\n\r\nOn the platform a chaplain of the Cardinal violently accused the Lord\r\nBishop. \"You do wrong to accept such an abjuration. 'Tis a mere\r\nmockery,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You lie,\" retorted my Lord Pierre. \"I, the judge of a religious suit,\r\nought to seek the salvation of this woman rather than her death.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal silenced his chaplain.[2494]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2494: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 147, 156.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Earl of Warwick came up to the judges and\r\ncomplained of what they had done, adding: \"The King is not well\r\nserved, since Jeanne escapes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is stated that one of them replied: \"Have no fear, my Lord. She\r\nwill not escape us long.\"[2495]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2495: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 376.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly credible that any one should have actually said so, but\r\ndoubtless there were many at that time who thought it.\r\n\r\nWith what scorn must the Bishop of Beauvais have regarded those dull\r\nminds, incapable of understanding the service he was rendering to Old\r\nEngland by forcing this damsel to acknowledge that all she had\r\ndeclared and maintained in honour of her King was but lying and\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\nWith a pen that Massieu gave her Jeanne made a cross at the bottom of\r\nthe deed.[2496]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2496: _Ibid._, p. 17; vol. iii, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of howls and oaths from the English, my Lord of Beauvais\r\nread the more merciful of the sentences. It relieved Jeanne from\r\nexcommunication and reconciled her to Holy Mother Church.[2497] Further\r\nthe sentence ran:\r\n\r\n     \"... Because thou hast rashly sinned against God and Holy\r\n     Church, we, thy judges, that thou mayest do salutary\r\n     penance, out of our Grace and moderation, do condemn thee\r\n     finally and definitely to perpetual prison, with the bread\r\n     of sorrow and the water of affliction, so that there thou\r\n     mayest weep over thy offences and commit no other that may\r\n     be an occasion of weeping.\"[2498]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2497: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 450, 452.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2498: _Ibid._, p. 452.]\r\n\r\nThis penalty, like all other penalties, save death and mutilation, lay\r\nwithin the power of ecclesiastical judges. They inflicted it so\r\nfrequently that in the early days of the Holy Inquisition, the Fathers\r\nof the Council of Narbonne said that stones and mortar would become as\r\nscarce as money.[2499] It was a penalty doubtless, but one which in\r\ncharacter and significance differed from the penalties inflicted by\r\nsecular courts; it was a penance. According to the mercy of\r\necclesiastical law, prison was a place suitable for repentance, where,\r\nin one perpetual penance, the condemned might eat the bread of sorrow\r\nand drink the waters of affliction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2499: L. Tanon, _Tribunaux de l'inquisition_, p. 454.]\r\n\r\nHow foolish was he, who by refusing to enter that prison or by\r\nescaping from it, should reject the salutary healing of his soul! By\r\nso doing he was fleeing from the gentle tribunal of penance, and the\r\nChurch in sadness cut him off from the communion of the faithful. By\r\ninflicting this penalty, which a good Catholic must needs regard\r\nrather as a favour than a punishment, my Lord the Bishop and my Lord\r\nthe Holy Vicar of the Inquisition were conforming to the custom,\r\nwhereby our Holy Mother Church became reconciled to heretics. But had\r\nthey power to execute their sentence? The prison to which they\r\ncondemned Jeanne, the expiatory prison, the salutary confinement, must\r\nbe in a dungeon of the Church. Could they send her there?\r\n\r\nJeanne, turning towards them, said: \"Now, you Churchmen, take me to\r\nyour prison. Let me be no longer in the hands of the English.\"[2500]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2500: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nMany of those clerics had promised it to her.[2501] They had deceived\r\nher. They knew it was not possible; for it had been stipulated that\r\nthe King of England's men should resume possession of Jeanne after the\r\ntrial.[2502]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2501: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 52, 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2502: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop gave the order: \"Take her back to the place whence you\r\nbrought her.\"[2503]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2503: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nHe, a judge of the Church, committed the crime of surrendering the\r\nChurch's daughter reconciled and penitent, to laymen. Among them she\r\ncould not mourn over her sins; and they, hating her body and caring\r\nnought for her soul, were to tempt her and cause her to fall back into\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWhile Jeanne was being taken back in the cart to her tower in the\r\nfields, the soldiers insulted her and their captains did not rebuke\r\nthem.[2504]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2504: _Ibid._, p. 376.]\r\n\r\nThereafter, the Vice-Inquisitor and with him divers doctors and\r\nmasters, went to her prison and charitably exhorted her. She promised\r\nto wear woman's apparel, and to let her head be shaved.[2505]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2505: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 452-453.]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Bedford, knowing that she was a virgin, saw to it that\r\nshe was treated with respect.[2506] As the ladies of Luxembourg had\r\ndone formerly, she essayed to persuade her to wear the clothing of her\r\nsex. By a certain tailor, one Jeannotin Simon, she had had made for\r\nJeanne a gown which she had hitherto refused to wear. Jeannotin\r\nbrought the garment to the prisoner, who this time did not refuse it.\r\nIn putting it on, Jeannotin touched her bosom, which she resented. She\r\nboxed his ears;[2507] but she consented to wear the gown provided by\r\nthe Duchess.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2506: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2507: _Ibid._, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL FOR RELAPSE--SECOND SENTENCE--DEATH OF THE MAID\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, which was Trinity Sunday, there arose a\r\nrumour that Jeanne had resumed man's apparel. The report spread\r\nrapidly from the castle down the narrow streets where lived the clerks\r\nin the shadow of the cathedral. Straightway notaries and assessors\r\nhastened to the tower which looked on the fields.\r\n\r\nIn the outer court of the castle they found some hundred men-at-arms,\r\nwho welcomed them with threats and curses.[2508] These fellows did not\r\nyet understand that the judges had conducted the trial so as to bring\r\nhonour to old England and dishonour to the French. They did not\r\nrealise what it meant when the Maid of the Armagnacs, who hitherto had\r\nobstinately persisted in her utterances, was at length brought to\r\nconfess her impostures. They did not see how great was the advantage\r\nto their country when it was published abroad throughout the world\r\nthat Charles of Valois had been conducted to his coronation by a\r\nheretic. But no, the only idea these brutes were capable of grasping\r\nwas the burning of the girl prisoner who had struck terror into their\r\nhearts. The doctors and masters they treated as traitors, false\r\ncounsellors and Armagnacs.[2509]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2508: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2509: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 14; vol. iii, p. 148.]\r\n\r\nIn the castle yard is Maitre Andre Marguerie, bachelor in decrees,\r\narchdeacon of Petit-Caux, King's Counsellor,[2510] who is inquiring\r\nwhat has happened. He had displayed great assiduity in the trial. The\r\nMaid he held to be a crafty damsel.[2511] Now again he desired to give\r\nan expert's judgment touching what had just occurred.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2510: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_, pp. 82 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2511: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 354.]\r\n\r\n\"That Jeanne is to be seen dressed as a man is not everything,\" he\r\nsaid. \"We must know what motives induced her to resume masculine\r\nattire.\"\r\n\r\nMaitre Andre Marguerie was an eloquent orator, one of the shining\r\nlights of the Council of Constance. But, when a man-at-arms raised his\r\naxe against him and called out \"Traitor! Armagnac!\" Maitre Marguerie\r\nasked no further questions, but speedily departed, and went to bed\r\nvery sick.[2512]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2512: _Ibid._, vol. iii, pp. 158, 180.]\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday the 25th, there came to the castle the\r\nVice-Inquisitor, accompanied by divers doctors and masters. The\r\nRegistrar, Messire Guillaume Manchon, was summoned. He was such a\r\ncoward that he dared not come save under the escort of one of the Earl\r\nof Warwick's men-at-arms.[2513] They found Jeanne wearing man's\r\napparel, jerkin and short tunic, with a hood covering her shaved head.\r\nHer face was in tears and disfigured by terrible suffering.[2514]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2513: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 454; vol. iii, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2514: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 5. Isambart's evidence refers to\r\nthis day, the 28th.]\r\n\r\nShe was asked when and why she had assumed this attire.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"'Tis but now that I have donned man's dress and put off\r\nwoman's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore did you put it on and who made you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I put it on of my own will and without constraint. I had liefer wear\r\nman's dress than woman's.\"\r\n\r\n\"You promised and swore not to wear man's dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never meant to take an oath not to wear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore did you return to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is more seemly to take it and wear man's dress, being\r\namongst men, than to wear woman's dress.... I returned to it because\r\nthe promise made me was not kept, to wit, that I should go to mass and\r\nshould receive my Saviour and be loosed from my bonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not abjure, and promise not to return to this dress?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had liefer die than be in bonds. But if I be allowed to go to mass\r\nand taken out of my bonds and put in a prison of grace, and given a\r\nwoman to be with me, I will be good and do as the Church shall\r\ncommand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard your Voices since Thursday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they say unto you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They told me that through Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret God gave\r\nme to wit his sore pity for the treachery, to which I consented in\r\nabjuring and recanting to save my life, and that in saving my life I\r\nwas losing my soul. Before Thursday my Voices had told me what I\r\nshould do and what I did do on that day. On the scaffold my Voices\r\ntold me to reply boldly to the preacher. He is a false preacher....\r\nMany things did he say that I have never done. If I were to say that\r\nGod has not sent me I should be damned. It is true that God has sent\r\nme. My Voices have since told me that by confessing I committed a\r\ngreat wickedness which I ought never to have done. All that I said I\r\nuttered through fear of the fire.\"[2515]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2515: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 455-457.]\r\n\r\nThus spake Jeanne in sore sorrow. And now what becomes of those\r\nmonkish tales of attempted violence related long afterwards by a\r\nregistrar and two churchmen?[2516] And how can Messire Massieu make us\r\nbelieve that Jeanne, unable to find her petticoats, put on her hose in\r\norder not to appear before her guards unclothed?[2517] The truth is\r\nvery different. It is Jeanne herself who confesses bravely and simply.\r\nShe repented of her abjuration, as of the greatest sin she had ever\r\ncommitted. She could not forgive herself for having lied through fear\r\nof death. Her Voices, who, before the sermon at Saint-Ouen had\r\nforetold that she would deny them, now came to her and spoke of \"the\r\nsore pity of her treachery.\" Could they say otherwise since they were\r\nthe voices of her own heart? And could Jeanne fail to listen to them\r\nsince she had always listened to them whenever they had counselled her\r\nto sacrifice and self-abnegation?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2516: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 5, 8, 365; vol. iii, pp. 148,\r\n149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2517: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nIt was out of obedience to her heavenly _Council_ that Jeanne had\r\nreturned to man's apparel, because she would not purchase her life at\r\nthe price of denying the Angel and the Saints, and because with her\r\nwhole heart and soul she rebelled against her recantation.\r\n\r\nStill the English were seriously to blame for having left her man's\r\nclothes. It would have been more humane to have taken them from her,\r\nsince if she wore them she must needs die. They had been put in a\r\nbag.[2518] Her guards may even be suspected of having tempted her by\r\nplacing under her very eyes those garments which recalled to her days\r\nof happiness. They had taken away all her few possessions, even her\r\npoor brass ring, everything save that suit which meant death to her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2518: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nTo blame also were her ecclesiastical judges who should not have\r\nsentenced her to imprisonment if they foresaw that they could not\r\nplace her in an ecclesiastical prison, nor have commanded her a\r\npenance which they knew they were unable to enforce. Likewise to blame\r\nwere the Bishop of Beauvais and the Vice-Inquisitor; because after\r\nhaving, for the good of her sinful soul, prescribed the bread of\r\nbitterness and the water of affliction, they gave her not this bread\r\nand this water, but delivered her in disgrace into the hands of her\r\ncruel enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen she uttered the words, \"God by Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret\r\nhath given me to wit the sore pity of the treason to which I\r\nconsented,\" Jeanne consummated the sacrifice of her life.[2519]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2519: \"_Responsio mortifera_,\" wrote the notary Boisguillaume\r\nin the margin of his minutes. _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 456, 457.]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and the Inquisitor had now to proceed in conformity with\r\nthe law. The interrogatory however lasted a few moments longer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe that your Voices are Saint Margaret and Saint\r\nCatherine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and they come from God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us the truth touching the crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my knowledge I told you the truth of everything at the\r\ntrial.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the scaffold, at the time of your abjuration, you did acknowledge\r\nbefore us your judges and before many others, and in the presence of\r\nthe people, that you had falsely boasted your Voices to be those of\r\nSaint Catherine and Saint Margaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean thus to do or to say. I did not deny, neither did I\r\nintend to deny, my apparitions and to say that they were not Saint\r\nMargaret and Saint Catherine. All that I have said was through fear of\r\nthe fire, and I recanted nothing that was not contrary to the truth. I\r\nhad liefer do my penance once and for all, to wit by dying, than\r\nendure further anguish in prison. Whatsoever abjuration I have been\r\nforced to make, I never did anything against God and religion. I did\r\nnot understand what was in the deed of abjuration, wherefore I did not\r\nmean to abjure anything unless it were Our Lord's will. If the judges\r\nwish I will resume my woman's dress. But nothing else will I do.\"[2520]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2520: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 456-458.]\r\n\r\nComing out of the prison, my Lord of Beauvais met the Earl of Warwick\r\naccompanied by many persons. He said to him: \"Farewell. _Faites bonne\r\nchere._\" It is said that he added, laughing: \"It is done! We have\r\ncaught her.\"[2521] The words are his, doubtless, but we are not certain\r\nthat he laughed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2521: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 5, 8, 305.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Tuesday the 29th, he assembled the tribunal in the\r\nchapel of the Archbishop's house. The forty-two assessors present were\r\ninformed of what had happened on the previous day and invited to state\r\ntheir opinions, the nature of which might easily be anticipated.[2522]\r\nEvery heretic who retracted his confession was held a perjurer, not\r\nonly impenitent but relapsed. And the relapsed were given up to the\r\nsecular arm.[2523]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2522: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 459, 467.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2523: Bernard Gui, _Pratique_, part iii, p. 144. L. Tanon,\r\n_Tribunaux de l'inquisition_, pp. 464 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nMaitre Nicholas de Venderes, canon, archdeacon, was the first to state\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Jeanne is and must be held a heretic. She must be delivered to the\r\nsecular authority.\"[2524]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2524: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 462, 463.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Abbot of Fecamp expressed his opinion in the following terms:\r\n\"Jeanne has relapsed. Nevertheless it is well that the terms of her\r\nabjuration once read to her, be read a second time and explained, and\r\nthat at the same time she be reminded of God's word. This done, it is\r\nfor us, her judges, to declare her a heretic and to abandon her to the\r\nsecular authority, entreating it to deal leniently with her.\"[2525]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2525: _Ibid._, p. 463.]\r\n\r\nThis plea for leniency was a mere matter of form. If the Provost of\r\nRouen had taken it into consideration he also would have been\r\nexcommunicated, with a further possibility of temporal punishment.[2526]\r\nAnd yet there were certain counsellors who even wished to dispense with\r\nthis empty show of pity, urging that there was no need for such a\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2526: L. Tanon, _Tribunaux de l'inquisition_, pp. 472, 473.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Guillaume Erard and sundry other assessors, among whom were\r\nMaitres Marguerie, Loiseleur, Pierre Maurice, and Brother Martin\r\nLadvenu, were of the opinion of my Lord Abbot of Fecamp.[2527]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2527: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 463, 467.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Thomas de Courcelles advised the woman being again charitably\r\nadmonished touching the salvation of her soul.\r\n\r\nSuch likewise was the opinion of Brother Isambart de la Pierre.[2528]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2528: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 466.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bishop, having listened to these opinions, concluded that\r\nJeanne must be proceeded against as one having relapsed. Accordingly\r\nhe summoned her to appear on the morrow, the 30th of May, in the old\r\nMarket Square.[2529]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2529: _Ibid._, pp. 467, 469.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of that Wednesday, the 30th of May, by the command of\r\nmy Lord of Beauvais, the two young friars preachers, bachelors in\r\ntheology, Brother Martin Ladvenu and Brother Isambart de la Pierre,\r\nwent to Jeanne in her prison. Brother Martin told her that she was to\r\ndie that day.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of this cruel death, amidst the silence of her Voices,\r\nshe understood at length that she would not be delivered. Cruelly\r\nawakened from her dream, she felt heaven and earth failing her, and\r\nfell into a deep despair.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" she cried, \"shall so terrible a fate betide me as that my body\r\never pure and intact shall to-day be burned and reduced to ashes? Ah\r\nme! Ah me! Liefer would I be seven times beheaded than thus be burned.\r\nAlas! had I been in the prison of the Church, to which I submitted,\r\nand guarded by ecclesiastics and not by my foes and adversaries, so\r\nwoeful a misfortune as this would not have befallen me. Oh! I appeal\r\nto God, the great judge, against this violence and these sore wrongs\r\nwith which I am afflicted.\"[2530]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2530: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 3, 4 (evidence of Brother\r\nIsambart de la Pierre). _Ibid._, p. 8 (evidence of Brother Martin\r\nLadvenu).]\r\n\r\nWhile she was lamenting, the doctors and masters, Nicolas de\r\nVenderes, Pierre Maurice and Nicolas Loiseleur, entered the prison;\r\nthey came by order of my Lord of Beauvais.[2531] On the previous day\r\nthirty-nine counsellers out of forty-two, declaring that Jeanne had\r\nrelapsed, had added that they deemed it well she should be reminded of\r\nthe terms of her abjuration.[2532] Wherefore, according to the counsel\r\nof these clerics, the Lord Bishop had sent certain learned doctors to\r\nthe relapsed heretic and had resolved to come to her himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2531: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 481. (In the Introduction I have\r\ngiven my reasons for regarding the information given after the death\r\nof the Maid as possessing great historical significance.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2532: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 462-467.]\r\n\r\nShe must needs submit to one last examination.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe that your Voices and apparitions come from good or\r\nfrom evil spirits?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not; but I appeal to my Mother the Church.\"[2533]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2533: _Ibid._, p. 479. Or \"to such of you as are churchmen.\"\r\n_Ibid._, p. 482 (information furnished after her death).]\r\n\r\nMaitre Pierre Maurice, a reader of Terence and Virgil, was filled with\r\npity for this hapless Maid.[2534] On the previous day he had declared\r\nher to have relapsed because his knowledge of theology forced him to\r\nit; and now he was concerned for the salvation of this soul in peril,\r\nwhich could not be saved except by recognising the falseness of its\r\nVoices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2534: Robillard de Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_.]\r\n\r\n\"Are they indeed real?\" he asked her.\r\n\r\nShe replied, \"Whether they be good or bad, they appeared to me.\"\r\n\r\nShe affirmed that with her eyes she had seen, with her ears heard, the\r\nVoices and apparitions which had been spoken of at the trial.\r\n\r\nShe heard them most frequently, she said, at the hour of compline and\r\nof matins, when the bells were ringing.[2535]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2535: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 480.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Pierre Maurice, being the Pope's secretary, was debarred from\r\nopenly professing the Pyrrhonic philosophy. He inclined, however, to a\r\nrational interpretation of natural phenomena, if we may judge from his\r\nremarking to Jeanne that the ringing of bells often sounded like\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nWithout describing the exact form of her apparitions, Jeanne said they\r\ncame to her in a great multitude and were very tiny. She believed in\r\nthem no longer, being fully persuaded that they had deceived her.\r\n\r\nMaitre Pierre Maurice asked about the Angel who had brought the crown.\r\n\r\nShe replied that there had never been a crown save that promised by\r\nher to her King, and that the Angel was herself.[2536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2536: _Ibid._, pp. 480, 481 (information furnished after her\r\ndeath).]\r\n\r\nAt that moment the Lord Bishop of Beauvais and the Vice-Inquisitor\r\nentered the prison, accompanied by Maitre Thomas de Courcelles and\r\nMaitre Jacques Lecamus.[2537]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2537: _Ibid._, pp. 482, 483.]\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the Judge who had brought her to such a pass she\r\ncried, \"Bishop, I die through you.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied by piously admonishing her. \"Ah! Jeanne, bear all in\r\npatience. You die because you have not kept your promise and have\r\nreturned to evil-doing.[2538] Now, Jeanne,\" he asked her, \"you have\r\nalways said that your Voices promised you deliverance; you behold how\r\nthey have deceived you, wherefore tell us the truth.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2538: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 114 (evidence of Brother Jehan\r\nToutmouille).]\r\n\r\nShe replied, \"Verily, I see that they have deceived me.\"[2539]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2539: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 481, 482 (information given after\r\nJeanne's death).]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and the Vice-Inquisitor withdrew. They had triumphed over a\r\npoor girl of twenty.\r\n\r\n\"If after their condemnation heretics repent, and if the signs of\r\ntheir repentance are manifest, the sacraments of confession and the\r\neucharist may not be denied them, provided they demand them with\r\nhumility.\"[2540] Thus ran the sacred decretals. But no recantation, no\r\nassurance of conformity, could save the relapsed heretic. He was\r\npermitted confession, absolution, and communion; which means that at\r\nthe bar of the Sacrament the sincerity of his repentance and\r\nconversion was believed in. But at the same time it was declared\r\njudicially that his repentance was not believed in and that\r\nconsequently he must die.[2541]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2540: _Textus decretalium_, lib. v, ch. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2541: Ignace de Doellinger, _La Papaute_, traduit par A.\r\nGiraud-Teulon, Paris, 1904, in 8vo, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nBrother Martin Ladvenu heard Jeanne's confession. Then he sent Messire\r\nMassieu, the Usher, to my Lord of Beauvais, to inform him that she\r\nasked to be given the body of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop assembled certain doctors to confer on this subject; and\r\nafter they had deliberated, he replied to the Usher: \"Tell Brother\r\nMartin to give her the communion and all that she shall ask.\"[2542]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2542: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 158.]\r\n\r\nMessire Massieu returned to the castle to bear this reply to Brother\r\nMartin. For a second time Brother Martin heard Jeanne in confession\r\nand gave her absolution.[2543]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2543: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 334.]\r\n\r\nA cleric, one Pierre, brought the body of Our Lord in an unceremonious\r\nfashion, on a paten covered with the cloth used to put over the\r\nchalice, without lights or procession, without surplice or stole.[2544]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2544: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 19, 334. De Beaurepaire,\r\n_Recherches sur le proces_, pp. 116, 117.]\r\n\r\nThis did not please Brother Martin, who sent to fetch a stole and\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\nThen, taking the consecrated host in his fingers and presenting it to\r\nJeanne, he said: \"Do you believe this to be the body of Christ?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it alone is able to deliver me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she entreated that it should be given to her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you still believe in your Voices?\" asked the officiating priest.\r\n\r\n\"I believe in God alone, and will place no trust in the Voices who\r\nhave thus deceived me.\"[2545]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2545: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 482, 483 (information procured\r\nafter Jeanne's death).]\r\n\r\nAnd shedding many tears she received the body of Our Lord very\r\ndevoutly. Then to God, to the Virgin Mary and to the saints she\r\noffered prayers beautiful and reverent and gave such signs of\r\nrepentance that those present were moved to tears.[2546]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2546: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 19, 308, 320; vol. iii, pp. 114,\r\n158, 183, 197.]\r\n\r\nContrite and sorrowful she said to Maitre Pierre Maurice:[2547] \"Maitre\r\nPierre, where shall I be this evening?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2547: For Jeanne's communion see also De Beaurepaire,\r\n_Recherches sur le proces_, pp. 116-117.]\r\n\r\n\"Do you not trust in the Lord?\" asked the canon.\r\n\r\n\"Yea, God helping me, I shall be in Paradise.\"[2548]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2548: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 191.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Nicolas Loiseleur exhorted her to correct the error she had\r\ncaused to grow up among the people.\r\n\r\n\"To this end you must openly declare that you have been deceived and\r\nhave deceived the folk and that you humbly ask pardon.\"\r\n\r\nThen, fearing lest she might forget when the time came for her to be\r\npublicly judged, she asked Brother Martin to put her in mind of this\r\nmatter and of others touching her salvation.[2549]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2549: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 485. Maitre N. Taquel would lead us\r\nto believe that the interrogatories took place after Jeanne's\r\ncommunion, but this can hardly be admitted.]\r\n\r\nMaitre Loiseleur went away giving signs of violent grief. Walking\r\nthrough the streets like a madman, he was howled at by the\r\n_Godons_.[2550]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2550: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 320; vol. iii, p. 162.]\r\n\r\nIt was about nine o'clock in the morning when Brother Martin and\r\nMessire Massieu took Jeanne out of the prison, wherein she had been in\r\nbonds one hundred and seventy-eight days. She was placed in a cart,\r\nand, escorted by eighty men-at-arms, was driven along the narrow\r\nstreets to the Old Market Square, close to the River.[2551] This square\r\nwas bordered on the east by a wooden market-house, the butcher's\r\nmarket, on the west by the cemetery of Saint-Sauveur, on the edge of\r\nwhich, towards the square, stood the church of Saint-Sauveur.[2552] In\r\nthis place three scaffolds had been raised, one against the northern\r\ngable of the market-house; and in its erection several tiles of the\r\nroof had been broken.[2553] On this scaffold Jeanne was to be\r\nstationed, there to listen to the sermon. Another and a larger\r\nscaffold had been erected adjoining the cemetery. There the judges and\r\nthe prelates were to sit.[2554] The pronouncing of sentence in a\r\nreligious trial was an act of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. For the\r\nplace of its pronouncement the Inquisitor and the Ordinary preferred\r\nconsecrated territory, holy ground. True it is that a bull of Pope\r\nLucius forbade such sentences to be given in churches and cemeteries;\r\nbut the judges eluded this rule by recommending the secular arm to\r\nmodify its sentence. The third scaffold, opposite the second, was of\r\nplaster, and stood in the middle of the square, on the spot whereon\r\nexecutions usually took place. On it was piled the wood for the\r\nburning. On the stake which surmounted it was a scroll bearing the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Jehanne, who hath caused herself to be called the Maid, a liar,\r\npernicious, deceiver of the people, soothsayer, superstitious, a\r\nblasphemer against God, presumptuous, miscreant, boaster, idolatress,\r\ncruel, dissolute, an invoker of devils, apostate, schismatic, and\r\nheretic.\"[2555]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2551: A.

A crowd\r\nof curious folk pressed behind the guards, the windows were filled and\r\nthe roofs covered with onlookers. Jeanne was brought on to the\r\nscaffold which had its back to the market-house gable. She wore a long\r\ngown and hood.[2556] Maitre Nicolas Midi, doctor in theology, came up\r\non to the same platform and began to preach to her.[2557] As the text\r\nof his sermon he took the words of the Apostle in the first Epistle to\r\nthe Corinthians:[2558] \"And whether one member suffer, all the members\r\nsuffer with it.\" Jeanne patiently listened to the sermon.[2559]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2556: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 470; vol. ii, pp. 14, 303, 328;\r\nvol. iii, pp. 159, 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2557: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 470; vol. ii, p. 334; vol. iii, pp.\r\n53, 114, 159.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2558: Chapter xii, 26 (W.S.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2559: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nThen my Lord of Beauvais, in his own name and that of the\r\nVice-Inquisitor, pronounced the sentence.\r\n\r\nHe declared Jeanne to be a relapsed heretic.\r\n\r\n\"We declare that thou, Jeanne, art a corrupt member, and in order that\r\nthou mayest not infect the other members, we are resolved to sever\r\nthee from the unity of the Church, to tear thee from its body, and to\r\ndeliver thee to the secular power. And we reject thee, we tear thee\r\nout, we abandon thee, beseeching this same secular power, that\r\ntouching death and the mutilation of the limbs, it may be pleased to\r\nmoderate its sentence....\"[2560]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2560: _Ibid._, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nBy this formula, the ecclesiastical judge withdrew from any share in\r\nthe violent death of a fellow creature: _Ecclesia abhorret a\r\nsanguine_.[2561] But every one knew how much such an entreaty was\r\nworth; and all were aware that if the impossible had happened and the\r\nmagistrate had granted it, he would have been subject to the same\r\npenalties as the heretic. Things had now come to such a pass that had\r\nthe city of Rouen belonged to King Charles, he himself could not have\r\nsaved the Maid from the stake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2561: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition_, p.\r\n374.]\r\n\r\nWhen the sentence was announced Jeanne breathed heart-rending sighs.\r\nWeeping bitterly, she fell on her knees, commended her soul to God, to\r\nOur Lady, to the blessed saints of Paradise, many of whom she\r\nmentioned by name. Very humbly did she ask for mercy from all manner\r\nof folk, of whatsoever rank or condition, of her own party and of the\r\nenemy's, entreating them to forgive the wrong she had done them and to\r\npray for her. She asked pardon of her judges, of the English, of King\r\nHenry, of the English princes of the realm. Addressing all the priests\r\nthere present she besought each one to say a mass for the salvation of\r\nher soul.[2562]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2562: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 19; vol. iii, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nThus for one half hour did she continue with sighs and tears to give\r\nexpression to the sentiments of humiliation and contrition with which\r\nthe clerics had inspired her.[2563]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2563: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 19, 351.]\r\n\r\nAnd even now she did not neglect to defend the honour of the fair\r\nDauphin, whom she had so greatly loved.\r\n\r\nShe was heard to say: \"It was never my King who induced me to do\r\nanything I have done, either good or evil.\"[2564]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2564: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nMany of the bystanders wept. A few English laughed. Certain of the\r\ncaptains, who could make nothing of the edifying ceremonial of\r\necclesiastical justice, grew impatient. Seeing Messire Massieu in the\r\npulpit and hearing him exhort Jeanne to make a good end, they cried:\r\n\r\n\"What now, priest! Art thou going to keep us here to dinner?\"[2565]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2565: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 6, 20; vol. iii, pp. 53, 177,\r\n186.]\r\n\r\nAt Rouen, when a heretic was given up to the secular arm, it was\r\ncustomary to take him to the town hall, where the town council made\r\nknown unto him his sentence.[2566] In Jeanne's case these forms were\r\nnot observed. The Bailie, Messire le Bouteiller, who was present,\r\nwaved his hand and said: \"Take her, take her.\"[2567] Straightway, two\r\nof the King's sergeants dragged her to the base of the scaffold and\r\nplaced her in a cart which was waiting. On her head was set a great\r\nfool's cap made of paper, on which were written the words:\r\n\"_Heretique, relapse, apostate, idolatre_\"; and she was handed over to\r\nthe executioner.[2568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2566: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 188. A. Sarrazin, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\net la Normandie_, p. 386. Guedon and Ladvenu added to their evidence\r\nthat not long afterwards a certain Georges Folenfant was also given up\r\nto the secular arm. But the Archbishop and the Inquisitor sent Ladvenu\r\nto the Bailie \"in order to warn him that the said Georges was not to\r\nbe treated like the Maid who was burned without the pronouncement of\r\nany definite and final sentence.\" _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2567: _Ibid._, p. 344.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2568: Falconbridge, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 459. Yet Martin\r\nLadvenu says \"until the last hour,\" etc., which is obviously false.]\r\n\r\nA bystander heard her saying: \"Ah! Rouen, sorely do I fear that thou\r\nmayest have to suffer for my death.\"[2569]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2569: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nShe evidently still regarded herself as the messenger from Heaven, the\r\nangel of the realm of France. Possibly the illusion, so cruelly reft\r\nfrom her, returned at last to enfold her in its beneficent veil. At\r\nany rate, she appears to have been crushed; all that remained to her\r\nwas an infinite horror of death and a childlike piety.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical judges had barely time to descend and flee from a\r\nspectacle which they could not have witnessed without violating the\r\nlaws of clerical procedure. They were all weeping: the Lord Bishop of\r\nTherouanne, Chancellor of England, had his eyes full of tears. The\r\nCardinal of Winchester, who was said never to enter a church save to\r\npray for the death of an enemy,[2570] had pity on this damsel so woeful\r\nand so contrite. Brother Pierre Maurice, the canon who was a reader of\r\nthe AEneid, could not keep back his tears. All the priests who had\r\ndelivered her to the executioner were edified to see her make so holy\r\nan end. That is what Maitre Jean Alespee meant when he sighed: \"I\r\nwould that my soul were where I believe the soul of that woman to\r\nbe.\"[2571] To himself and the hapless sufferer he applied the following\r\nlines from the _Dies irae_:\r\n\r\n    _Qui Mariam absolvisti,\r\n    Mihi quoque spem dedisti._[2572]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2570: Shakespeare, Henry VI, part 1, act i, scene 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2571: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 6; vol. iii, pp. 53, 191, 375.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2572: _Missel Romain, Office des morts._ Cf. Le P. C. Clair,\r\n_Le Dies irae, histoire, traduction et commentaire_, Paris, in 8vo,\r\n1881, pp. 38-142.]\r\n\r\nBut none the less he must have believed that by her heresies and her\r\nobstinacy she had brought death on herself.\r\n\r\nThe two young friars preachers and the Usher Massieu accompanied\r\nJeanne to the stake.\r\n\r\nShe asked for a cross. An Englishman made a tiny one out of two pieces\r\nof wood, and gave it to her. She took it devoutly and put it in her\r\nbosom, on her breast. Then she besought Brother Isambart to go to the\r\nneighbouring church to fetch a cross, to bring it to her and hold it\r\nbefore her, so that as long as she lived, the cross on which God was\r\ncrucified should be ever in her sight.\r\n\r\nMassieu asked a priest of Saint-Sauveur for one, and it was brought.\r\nJeanne weeping kissed it long and tenderly, and her hands held it\r\nwhile they were free.[2573]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2573: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 6, 20.]\r\n\r\nAs she was being bound to the stake she invoked the aid of Saint\r\nMichael; and now at length no examiner was present to ask her whether\r\nit were really he she saw in her father's garden. She prayed also to\r\nSaint Catherine.[2574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2574: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nWhen she saw a light put to the stake, she cried loudly, \"Jesus!\" This\r\nname she repeated six times.[2575] She was also heard asking for holy\r\nwater.[2576]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2575: _Ibid._, p. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2576: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 8; vol. iii, pp. 169, 194.]\r\n\r\nIt was usual for the executioner, in order to cut short the sufferings\r\nof the victim, to stifle him in dense smoke before the flames had had\r\ntime to ascend; but the Rouen executioner was too terrified of the\r\nprodigies worked by the Maid to do thus; and besides he would have\r\nfound it difficult to reach her, because the Bailie had had the\r\nplaster scaffold made unusually high. Wherefore the executioner\r\nhimself, hardened man that he was, judged her death to have been a\r\nterribly cruel one.[2577]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2577: _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nOnce again Jeanne uttered the name of Jesus; then she bowed her head\r\nand gave up her spirit.[2578]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2578: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 186.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was dead the Bailie commanded the executioner to\r\nscatter the flames in order to see that the prophetess of the\r\nArmagnacs had not escaped with the aid of the devil or in some other\r\nmanner.[2579] Then, after the poor blackened body had been shown to the\r\npeople, the executioner, in order to reduce it to ashes, threw on to\r\nthe fire coal, oil and sulphur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2579: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 191. _Journal d'un bourgeois de\r\nParis_, pp. 269, 270.]\r\n\r\nIn such an execution the combustion of the corpse was rarely\r\ncomplete.[2580] Among the ashes, when the fire was extinguished, the\r\nheart and entrails were found intact. For fear lest Jeanne's remains\r\nshould be taken and used for witchcraft or other evil practices,[2581]\r\nthe Bailie had them thrown into the Seine.[2582]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2580: L. Tanon, _Histoire des tribunaux de l'inquisition_, p.\r\n478.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2581: _Chronique des cordeliers_, fol. 507 verso. _Journal\r\nd'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 269.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2582: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 159, 160, 185; vol. iv, p. 518.\r\nTh.

The\r\ncreature complained that he had found it very difficult to make an end\r\nof Jeanne. According to a legend invented afterwards, he told the\r\nmonks that he feared damnation for having burned a saint.[2583] Had he\r\nactually spoken thus in the house of the Vice-Inquisitor he would have\r\nbeen straightway cast into the lowest dungeon, there to await a trial\r\nfor heresy, which would have probably resulted in his being sentenced\r\nto suffer the death he had inflicted on her whom he had called a\r\nsaint. And what could have led him to suppose that the woman condemned\r\nby good Father Lemaistre and my Lord of Beauvais was not a bad woman?\r\nThe truth is that in the presence of these friars he arrogated to\r\nhimself merit for having executed a witch and taken pains therein,\r\nwherefore he came to ask for his pot of wine. One of the monks, who\r\nhappened to be a friar preacher, Brother Pierre Bosquier, forgot\r\nhimself so far as to say that it was wrong to have condemned the\r\nMaid. These words, albeit they were heard by only a few persons, were\r\ncarried to the Inquisitor General. When he was summoned to answer for\r\nthem, Brother Pierre Bosquier declared very humbly that his words were\r\naltogether wrong and tainted with heresy, and that indeed he had only\r\nuttered them when he was full of wine. On his knees and with clasped\r\nhands he entreated Holy Mother Church, his judges and the most\r\nredoubtable lords to pardon him. Having regard to his repentance and\r\nin consideration of his cloth and of his having spoken in a state of\r\nintoxication, my Lord of Beauvais and the Vice-Inquisitor showed\r\nindulgence to Brother Pierre Bosquier. By a sentence pronounced on the\r\n8th of August, 1431, they condemned him to be imprisoned in the house\r\nof the friars preachers and fed on bread and water until Easter.[2584]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2583: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 7, 352, 366.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2584: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 493, 495.]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June the judges and counsellors, who had sat in\r\njudgment on Jeanne, received letters of indemnity from the Great\r\nCouncil. What was the object of these letters? Was it in case the\r\nholders of them should be proceeded against by the French? But in that\r\nevent the letters would have done them more harm than good.[2585]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2585: Le P. Denifle and Chatelain, _Cartularium Universitatis\r\nParisiensis_, vol. iv, p. 527.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor of England sent to the Emperor, to the Kings and\r\nto the princes of Christendom, letters in Latin; to the prelates,\r\ndukes, counts, lords, and all the towns of France, letters in\r\nFrench.[2586] Herein he made known unto them that King Henry and his\r\nCounsellors had had sore pity on the Maid, and that if they had caused\r\nher death it was through their zeal for the faith and their\r\nsolicitude Christian folk.[2587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2586: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 240, 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2587: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 485, 496; vol. iv, p. 403.\r\nMonstrelet, vol. iv, ch. cv.]\r\n\r\nIn like tenor did the University of Paris write to the Holy Father,\r\nthe Emperor and the College of Cardinals.[2588]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2588: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 496, 500.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, the day of Saint-Martin-le-Bouillant, Master Jean\r\nGraverent, Prior of the Jacobins, Inquisitor of the Faith, preached at\r\nSaint-Martin-des-Champs. In his sermon he related the deeds of Jeanne,\r\nand told how for her errors and shortcomings she had been delivered to\r\nthe secular judges and burned alive.\r\n\r\nThen he added: \"There were four, three of whom have been taken, to\r\nwit, this Maid, Pierronne, and her companion. One, Catherine de la\r\nRochelle, still remaineth with the Armagnacs. Friar Richard, the\r\nFranciscan, who attracted so great a multitude of folk when he\r\npreached in Paris at the Innocents and elsewhere, directed these\r\nwomen; he was their spiritual father.\"[2589]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2589: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 270, 272. This\r\nsermon contains curious inaccuracies. Are they the fault of the\r\nInquisitor or of the author of _Le Journal_?]\r\n\r\nWith Pierronne burned in Paris, her companion eating the bread of\r\nbitterness and drinking the water of affliction in the prison of the\r\nChurch, and Jeanne burned at Rouen, the royal company of _beguines_\r\nwas now almost entirely annihilated. There only remained to the King\r\nthe holy dame of La Rochelle, who had escaped from the hands of the\r\nParis Official; but her indiscreet talk had rendered her\r\ntroublesome.[2590] While his penitents were being discredited, good\r\nFriar Richard himself had fallen on evil days. The Vicars in the\r\ndiocese of Poitiers and the Inquisitor of the Faith had forbidden him\r\nto preach. The great orator, who had converted so many Christian folk,\r\ncould no longer thunder against gaming-tables and dice, against\r\nwomen's finery, and mandrakes arrayed in magnificent attire. No longer\r\ncould he declare the coming of Antichrist nor prepare souls for the\r\nterrible trials which were to herald the imminent end of the world. He\r\nwas ordered to lie under arrest in the Franciscan monastery at\r\nPoitiers. And doubtless it was with no great docility that he\r\nsubmitted to the sentence of his superiors; for on Friday, the 23rd of\r\nMarch, 1431, we find the Ordinary and the Inquisitor, asking aid in\r\nthe execution of the sentence from the Parliament of Poitiers, which\r\ndid not refuse it. Why did Holy Church exercise such severity towards\r\na preacher endowed with so wondrous a power of moving sinful souls? We\r\nmay at any rate suspect the reason. For some time the English and\r\nBurgundian clergy had been accusing him of apostasy and magic. Now,\r\nowing to the unity of the Church in general and to that of the\r\nGallican Church in particular, owing also to the authority of that\r\nbright sun of Christendom, the University of Paris, when a clerk was\r\nsuspected of error and heresy by the doctors of the English and\r\nBurgundian party he came to be looked at askance by the clergy who\r\nwere loyal to King Charles. Especially was this so when in a matter\r\ntouching the Catholic faith, the University had pronounced against him\r\nand in favour of the English. It is quite likely that the clerks of\r\nPoitiers had been prejudiced against Friar Richard by Pierronne's\r\nconviction and even by the Maid's trial. The good brother, who\r\npersisted in preaching the end of the world, was strongly suspected of\r\ndealing in the black art. Wherefore, realising the fate which was\r\nthreatening him, he fled, and was never heard of again.[2591]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2590: _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 473.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2591: Th. Basin, _Histoire de Charles VII et de Louis XI_,\r\nvol. iv, pp. 103, 104. Monstrelet, ch. lxiii. Bougenot, _Deux\r\ndocuments inedits relatifs a Jeanne d'Arc_, in _Revue bleue_, 13 Feb.,\r\n1892, pp. 203, 204.]\r\n\r\nNone the less, however, did the counsellors of King Charles continue\r\nto employ the devout in the army. At the time of the disappearance of\r\nFriar Richard and his penitents, they were making use of a young\r\nshepherd whom my Lord the Archbishop, Duke of Reims and Chancellor of\r\nthe kingdom, had proclaimed to be Jeanne's miraculous successor. And\r\nit was in the following circumstance that the shepherd was permitted\r\nto display his power.\r\n\r\nThe war continued. Twenty days after Jeanne's death the English in\r\ngreat force marched to recapture the town of Louviers. They had\r\ndelayed till then, not, as some have stated, because they despaired of\r\nsucceeding in anything as long as the Maid lived, but because they\r\nneeded time to collect money and engines for the siege.[2592] In the\r\nJuly and August of this same year, at Senlis and at Beauvais, my Lord\r\nof Reims, Chancellor of France and the Marechal de Boussac, were\r\nupholding the French cause. And we may be sure that my Lord of Reims\r\nwas upholding it with no little vigour since at the same time he was\r\ndefending the benefices which were so dear to him.[2593] A Maid had\r\nreconquered them, now he intended a lad to hold them. With this object\r\nhe employed the little shepherd, Guillaume, from the Lozere Mountains,\r\nwho, like Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Catherine of Sienna, had\r\nreceived stigmata. A party of French surprised the Regent at Mantes\r\nand were on the point of taking him prisoner. The alarm was given to\r\nthe army besieging Louviers; and two or three companies of men-at-arms\r\nwere despatched. They hastened to Mantes, where they learnt that the\r\nRegent had succeeded in reaching Paris. Thereupon, having been\r\nreinforced by troops from Gournay and certain other English garrisons,\r\nbeing some two thousand strong and commanded by the Earls of Warwick,\r\nArundel, Salisbury, and Suffolk, and by Lord Talbot and Sir Thomas\r\nKiriel, the English made bold to march upon Beauvais. The French,\r\ninformed of their approach, left the town at daybreak, and marched out\r\nto meet them in the direction of Savignies. King Charles's men,\r\nnumbering between eight hundred and one thousand combatants, were\r\ncommanded by the Marechal de Boussac, the Captains La Hire, Poton, and\r\nothers.[2594]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2592: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 3, 344, 348, 373; vol. iii, p.\r\n189; vol. v, pp. 169, 179, 181.

Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol. ii, p. 265.]\r\n\r\nThe shepherd Guillaume, whom they believed to be sent of God, was at\r\ntheir head, riding side-saddle and displaying the miraculous wounds in\r\nhis hands, his feet, and his left side.[2595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2595: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 272.]\r\n\r\nWhen they were about two and a half miles from the town, just when\r\nthey least expected it, a shower of arrows came down upon them. The\r\nEnglish, informed by their scouts of the French approach, had lain in\r\nwait for them in a hollow of the road. Now they attacked them closely\r\nboth in the van and in the rear. Each side fought valiantly. A\r\nconsiderable number were slain, which was not the case in most of the\r\nbattles of those days, when few but the fugitives were killed. But the\r\nFrench, feeling themselves surrounded, were seized with panic, and\r\nthus brought about their own destruction. Most of them, with the\r\nMarechal de Boussac and Captain La Hire, fled to the town of Beauvais.\r\nCaptain Poton and the shepherd, Guillaume, remained in the hands of\r\nthe English, who returned to Rouen in triumph.[2596]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2596: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 272.]\r\n\r\nPoton made sure of being ransomed in the usual manner. But the little\r\nshepherd could not hope for such a fate; he was suspected of heresy\r\nand magic; he had deceived Christian folk and accepted from them\r\nidolatrous veneration. The signs of our Saviour's passion that he bore\r\nupon him helped him not a whit; on the contrary the wounds, by the\r\nFrench held to have been divinely imprinted, to the English seemed the\r\nmarks of the devil.\r\n\r\nGuillaume, like the Maid, had been taken in the diocese of Beauvais.\r\nThe Lord Bishop of this town, Messire Pierre Cauchon, who had claimed\r\nthe right to try Jeanne, made a similar claim for Guillaume; and the\r\nshepherd was granted what the Maid had been refused, he was cast into\r\nan ecclesiastical prison.[2597] He would seem to have been less\r\ndifficult to guard than Jeanne and also less important. But the\r\nEnglish had recently learnt what was involved in a trial by the\r\nInquisition; they now knew how lengthy and how punctilious it was.\r\nMoreover, they did not see how it would profit them if this shepherd\r\nwere convicted of heresy. If the French had set their hope of success\r\nin war[2598] in Guillaume as they had done in Jeanne, then that hope\r\nwas but short-lived. To put the Armagnacs to shame by proving that\r\ntheir shepherd lad came from the devil, that game was not worth the\r\ncandle. The youth was taken to Rouen and thence to Paris.[2599]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2597: Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\nii, p. 248. De Beaurepaire, _Recherches sur les juges_, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2598: Lea, _History of the Inquisition_, vol. iii, 377 (ed.\r\n1905).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2599: Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol. ii, pp. 263, 264.]\r\n\r\nHe had been a prisoner for four months when King Henry VI, who was\r\nnine years old, came to Paris to be crowned in the church of Notre\r\nDame with the two crowns of France and England. With high pomp and\r\ngreat rejoicing he made his entrance into the city on Sunday, the 16th\r\nof December. Along the route of the procession, in the Rue du\r\nPonceau-Saint-Denys, had been constructed a fountain adorned with\r\nthree sirens; and from their midst rose a tall lily stalk, from the\r\nbuds and blossoms of which flowed streams of wine and milk. Folk\r\nflocked to drink of the fountain; and around its basin men disguised\r\nas savages entertained them with games and sham fights.\r\n\r\nFrom the Porte Saint-Denys to the Hotel Saint-Paul in the Marais, the\r\nchild King rode beneath a great azure canopy, embroidered with\r\nflowers-de-luce in gold, borne first by the four aldermen hooded and\r\nclothed in purple, then by the corporations, drapers, grocers,\r\nmoney-changers, goldsmiths and hosiers. Before him went twenty-five\r\nheralds and twenty-five trumpeters; followed by nine handsome men and\r\nnine beautiful ladies, wearing magnificent armour and bearing great\r\nshields, representing the nine _preux_ and the nine _preuses_, also by\r\na number of knights and squires. In this brilliant procession\r\nappeared the little shepherd Guillaume; he no longer stretched out his\r\narms to show the wounds of the passion, for he was strongly\r\nbound.[2600]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2600: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 274.]\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony he was conducted back to prison, whence he was\r\ntaken later to be sewn in a sack and thrown into the Seine.[2601] Even\r\nthe French admitted that Guillaume was but a simpleton and that his\r\nmission was not of God.[2602]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2601: Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol. ii, p. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2602: Martial d'Auvergne, _Vigiles_, ed. Coustelier, vol.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\nIn 1433, the Constable, with the assistance of the Queen of Sicily,\r\ncaused the capture and planned the assassination of La Tremouille. It\r\nwas the custom of the nobles of that day to appoint counsellors for\r\nKing Charles and afterwards to kill them. However, the sword which was\r\nto have caused the death of La Tremouille, owing to his corpulence,\r\nfailed to inflict a mortal wound. His life was saved, but his\r\ninfluence was dead. King Charles tolerated the Constable as he had\r\ntolerated the Sire de la Tremouille.[2603]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2603: Gruel, _Chronique d'Arthur de Richemont_, p. 81.\r\nVallet de Viriville, in _Nouvelle biographie generale_. De Beaucourt,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p. 297. E. Cosneau, _Le connetable\r\nde Richemont_, pp. 200, 201.]\r\n\r\nThe latter left behind him the reputation of having been grasping and\r\nindifferent to the welfare of the kingdom. Perhaps his greatest fault\r\nwas that he governed in a time of war and pillage, when friends and\r\nfoes alike were devouring the realm. He was charged with the\r\ndestruction of the Maid, of whom he was said to have been jealous.\r\nThis accusation proceeds from the House of Alencon, with whom the Lord\r\nChamberlain was not popular.[2604] On the contrary, it must be\r\nadmitted, that after the Lord Chancellor, La Tremouille was the\r\nboldest in employing the Maid, and if later she did thwart his plans\r\nthere is nothing to prove that it was his intention to have her\r\ndestroyed by the English. She destroyed herself and was consumed by\r\nher own zeal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2604: Perceval de Cagny, pp. 170, 173, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, the Lord Chamberlain was held to be a bad man;\r\nand, although his successor in the King's favour, the Duc de\r\nRichemont, was avaricious, hard, violent, incredibly stupid, surly,\r\nmalicious, always beaten and always discontented, the exchange\r\nappeared to be no loss. The Constable came in a fortunate hour, when\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy was making peace with the King of France.\r\n\r\nIn the words of a Carthusian friar, the English who had entered the\r\nkingdom by the hole made in Duke John's head on the Bridge of\r\nMontereau, only retained their hold on the kingdom by the hand of Duke\r\nPhilip. They were but few in number, and if the giant were to withdraw\r\nhis hand a breath of wind would suffice to blow them away. The Regent\r\ndied of sorrow and wrath, beholding the fulfilment of the horoscope of\r\nKing Henry VI: \"Exeter shall lose what Monmouth hath won.\"[2605]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2605: Carlier, _Histoire des Valois_, 1764, in 4to, vol. ii,\r\np. 442. Vallet de Viriville, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. i, p.\r\n307. The Regent also believed in astrology (B.N. MS. 1352).]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April, 1436, the Count of Richemont entered Paris. The\r\nnursing mother of Burgundian clerks and _Cabochien_ doctors, the\r\nUniversity herself, had helped to mediate peace.[2606]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2606: Gruel, _Chronique d'Arthur de Richemont_, pp. 120,\r\n121. Dom Felibien, _Histoire de Paris_, vol. iv, p. 597.]\r\n\r\nNow, one month after Paris had returned to her allegiance to King\r\nCharles, there appeared in Lorraine a certain damsel. She was about\r\ntwenty-five years old. Hitherto she had been called Claude; but she\r\nnow made herself known to divers lords of the town of Metz as being\r\nJeanne the Maid.[2607]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2607: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud de Metz_, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 321, 324.

Her two youngest sons were in the service of\r\nthe King of France, who had raised them to the rank of nobility and\r\ngiven them the name of Du Lys. Jean, the eldest, called\r\nPetit-Jean,[2609] had been appointed Bailie of Vermandois, then\r\nCaptain of Chartres. About this year, 1436, he was provost and captain\r\nof Vaucouleurs.[2610]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2608: Varanius alone says that Jacques d'Arc died of sorrow\r\nat the loss of his daughter. _Trial_, vol. v, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2609: _Ibid._, p. 280.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2610: _Ibid._, pp. 279, 280. G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La fausse\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 6, note 1.]\r\n\r\nThe youngest, Pierre, or Pierrelot, who had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe Burgundians before Compiegne at the same time as Jeanne, had just\r\nbeen liberated from the prison of the Bastard of Vergy.[2611]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2611: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 210. Lefevre de Saint-Remy, vol.\r\nii, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nBoth brothers believed that their sister had been burned at Rouen. But\r\nwhen they were told that she was living and wished to see them, they\r\nappointed a meeting at La-Grange-aux-Ormes, a village in the meadows\r\nof the Sablon, between the Seille and the Moselle, about two and a\r\nhalf miles south of Metz. They reached this place on the 20th of May.\r\nThere they saw her and recognised her immediately to be their sister;\r\nand she recognised them to be her brothers.[2612]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2612: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 321, 324.]\r\n\r\nShe was accompanied by certain lords of Metz, among whom was a man\r\nright noble, Messire Nicole Lowe, who was chamberlain to Charles\r\nVII.[2613] By divers tokens these nobles recognised her to be the Maid\r\nJeanne who had taken King Charles to be crowned at Reims. These tokens\r\nwere certain signs on the skin.[2614] Now there was a prophecy\r\nconcerning Jeanne which stated her to have a little red mark beneath\r\nthe ear.[2615] But this prophecy was invented after the events to\r\nwhich it referred. Consequently we may believe the Maid to have been\r\nthus marked. Was this the token by which the nobles of Metz recognised\r\nher?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2613: _Le Metz ancien_ (Metz, 1856, 2 vol. in folio) by the\r\nBaron d'Hannoncelles, which contains the genealogy of Nicole Lowe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2614: \"And was recognised by divers tokens\" (_enseignes_)\r\n(_Trial_, vol. v, p. 322). M. Lecoy de la Marche (_Une fausse Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, in _Revue des questions historiques_, October, 1871, p. 565),\r\nand M. Gaston Save (_Jehanne des Armoises, Pucelle d'Orleans_, Nancy,\r\n1893, p. 11) understand that she was recognised by several officers or\r\nensigns (_enseignes_). I have interpreted _enseignes_ in the ordinary\r\nsense of marks on the skin, birth-marks. (Cf. La Curne.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2615: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 322.]\r\n\r\nWe do not know by what means she claimed to have escaped death; but\r\nthere is reason to think[2616] that she attributed her deliverance to\r\nher holiness. Did she say that an angel had saved her from the fire?\r\nIt might be read in books how in the ancient amphitheatres lions\r\nlicked the bare feet of virgins, how boiling oil was as soothing as\r\nbalm to the bodies of holy martyrs; and how according to many of the\r\nold stories nothing short of the sword could take the life of God's\r\nmaidens. These ancient histories rested on a sure foundation. But if\r\nsuch tales had been related of the fifteenth century they might have\r\nappeared less credible. And this damsel does not seem to have employed\r\nthem to adorn her adventure. She was probably content to say that\r\nanother woman had been burned in her place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2616: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 354.]\r\n\r\nAccording to a confession she made afterwards, she came from Rome,\r\nwhere, accoutred in harness of war, she had fought valiantly in the\r\nservice of Pope Eugenius. She may even have told the Lorrainers of the\r\nfeats of prowess she had there accomplished.\r\n\r\nNow Jeanne had prophesied (at least so it was believed) that she would\r\ndie in battle against the infidel and that her mantle would fall upon\r\na maid of Rome. But such a saying, if it were known to these nobles of\r\nMetz, would be more likely to denounce this so-called Jeanne as an\r\nimposture than witness to the truth of her mission.[2617] However this\r\nmight be, they believed what this woman told them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2617: Nevertheless see on this subject M. Germain\r\nLefevre-Pontalis, who is our authority for this prophecy (Eberhard\r\nWindecke, pp. 108-111).]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, like many a noble of the republic,[2618] they were more\r\ninclined to King Charles than to the Duke of Burgundy. And we may be\r\nsure that, chivalrous knights as they were, they esteemed chivalry\r\nwherever they found it; wherefore, because of her valour they admired\r\nthe Maid; and they made her good cheer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2618: The republic of Metz (W.S.)]\r\n\r\nMessire Nicole Lowe gave her a charger and a pair of hose. The charger\r\nwas worth thirty francs--a sum wellnigh royal--for of the two horses\r\nwhich at Soissons and at Senlis the King gave the Maid Jeanne, one was\r\nworth thirty-eight livres ten sous, and the other thirty-seven livres\r\nten sous.[2619] Not more than sixteen francs had been paid for the\r\nhorse with which she had been provided at Vaucouleurs.[2620]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2619: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 322. Chronique de Philippe de Vigneulles, in _Les\r\nchroniques Messines_ of Huguenin, p. 198.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2620: _Trial_, vol. ii, p. 457. L. Champion, _Jeanne d'Arc\r\necuyere_, ch. ii, ch. vi.]\r\n\r\nNicole Grognot, governor of the town,[2621] offered a sword to the\r\nsister of the Du Lys brothers; Aubert Boullay presented her with a\r\nhood.[2622]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2621: Variant of _La chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_\r\nsent from Metz to Pierre du Puy, in _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 322, 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2622: _Ibid._, pp. 322, 324.]\r\n\r\nShe rode her horse with the same skill which seven years earlier, if\r\nwe may believe some rather mythical stories, had filled with wonder\r\nthe old Duke of Lorraine.[2623] And she spoke certain words to Messire\r\nNicole Lowe which confirmed him in his belief that she was indeed that\r\nsame Maid Jeanne who had fared forth into France. She had the ready\r\ntongue of a prophetess, and spoke in symbols and parables, revealing\r\nnought of her intent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2623: D. Calmet, _Histoire de Lorraine_, vol. vii. Proofs\r\nand illustrations, col. vi.]\r\n\r\nHer power would not come to her before Saint John the Baptist's Day,\r\nshe said. Now this was the very time which the Maid, after the Battle\r\nof Patay, in 1429, had fixed for the extermination of the English in\r\nFrance.[2624]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2624: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 322, 324. Eberhard Windecke, p.\r\n108. Morosini, vol. iii, p. 62, note.]\r\n\r\nThis prophecy had not been fulfilled and consequently had not been\r\nmentioned again. Jeanne, if she ever uttered it, and it is quite\r\npossible that she did, must have been the first to forget it.\r\nMoreover, Saint John's Day was a term commonly cited in leases, fairs,\r\ncontracts, hirings, etc., and it is quite conceivable that the\r\ncalendar of a prophetess may have been the same as that of a labourer.\r\n\r\nThe day after their arrival at La Grange-aux-Ormes, Monday, the 21st\r\nof May, the Du Lys brothers took her, whom they held to be their\r\nsister, to that town of Vaucouleurs[2625] whither Isabelle Romee's\r\ndaughter had gone to see Sire Robert de Baudricourt. In this town, in\r\nthe year 1436, there were still living many persons of different\r\nconditions, such as the Leroyer couple and the Seigneur Aubert\r\nd'Ourches,[2626] who had seen Jeanne in February, 1429.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2625: M. le Baron de Braux was kind enough to write to me\r\nfrom Boucq near Foug, Meurthe-et-Moselle, on the 28th of June, 1896,\r\nexplaining that Bacquillon (_Trial_, vol. v, p. 322) is an erroneous\r\nreading of one of the manuscripts of the Doyen of Saint-Thibaud. \"By\r\ncomparing,\" he added, \"the various versions (V. Quicherat and _Les\r\nchroniques Messines_) we may ascertain that it is really Vaucouleurs,\r\nValquelou,\" mistaken for Bacquillon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2626: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 406, 408, 445, 449.]\r\n\r\nAfter a week at Vaucouleurs she went to Marville, a small town between\r\nCorny and Pont-a-Mousson. There she spent Whitsuntide and abode for\r\nthree weeks in the house of one Jean Quenat.[2627] On her departure\r\nshe was visited by sundry inhabitants of Metz, who gave her jewels,\r\nrecognising her to be the Maid of France.[2628] Jeanne, it will be\r\nremembered, had been seen by divers knights of Metz at the time of\r\nKing Charles's coronation at Reims. At Marville, Geoffroy Desch,\r\nfollowing the example of Nicole Lowe, presented the so-called Jeanne\r\nwith a horse. Geoffroy Desch belonged to one of the most influential\r\nfamilies of the Republic of Metz. He was related to Jean Desch,\r\nmunicipal secretary in 1429.[2629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2627: The _Chronique de Tournai_ says of the true Jeanne\r\nthat she came from Mareville, a small town between Metz and\r\nPont-a-Mousson. \"This Jeanne had long dwelt and served in a _metairie_\r\n[a kind of farm] of this place.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2628: _Chronique du doyen Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_, vol.\r\nv, pp. 322, 324. Lecoy de la Marche, _Jeanne des Armoises_, p. 566. G.\r\nSave, _Jehanne des Armoises, pucelle d'Orleans_, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2629: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 352 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nFrom Marville, she went on a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Liance,\r\ncalled Lienche by the Picards and known later as Notre Dame de Liesse.\r\nAt Liance was worshipped a black image of the Virgin, which, according\r\nto tradition, had been brought by the crusaders from the Holy Land.\r\nThe chapel containing this image was situated between Laon and Reims.\r\nIt was said, by the priests who officiated there, to be one of the\r\nhalting places on the route of the coronation procession, where the\r\nkings and their retinues were accustomed to stop on their return from\r\nReims; but this is very likely not to be true. Whether it were such a\r\nhalting place or no, there is no doubt that the folk of Metz displayed\r\na particular devotion to Our Lady of Liance; and it seemed fitting\r\nthat Jeanne, who had escaped from an English prison, should go and\r\ngive thanks for her marvellous deliverance to the Black Virgin of\r\nPicardy.[2630]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2630: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 322, 324. Dom Lelong, _Histoire du diocese de Laon_, 1783,\r\np. 371. Abbe Ledouble, _Les origines de Liesse et du pelerinage de\r\nNotre-Dame_, Soissons, 1885, pp. 6 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThence she went on her way to Arlon, to Elisabeth of Gorlitz, Duchess\r\nof Luxembourg, an aunt by marriage of the Duke of Burgundy.[2631] She\r\nwas an old woman, who had been twice a widow. By extortion and\r\noppression she had made herself detested by her vassals. By this\r\nprincess Jeanne was well received. There was nothing strange in that.\r\nPersons living holy lives and working miracles were much sought after\r\nby princes and nobles who desired to discover secrets or to obtain the\r\nfulfilment of some wish. And the Duchess of Luxembourg might well\r\nbelieve this damsel to be the Maid Jeanne herself, since the brothers\r\nDu Lys, the nobles of Metz and the folk of Vaucouleurs were of that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2631: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 322, note 2. G. Lefevre-Pontalis,\r\n_La fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 21, note 1.]\r\n\r\nFor the generality of men, Jeanne's life and death were surrounded by\r\nmarvels and mysteries. Many had from the first doubted her having\r\nperished by the hand of the executioner. Certain were curiously\r\nreticent on this point; they said: \"the English had her publicly burnt\r\nat Rouen, or some other woman like her.\"[2632] Others confessed that\r\nthey did not know what had become of her.[2633]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2632: _Chronique normande_ (MS. in the British Museum), in\r\n_Trial_, vol. iv, p. 344. Symphorien Champier, _Nef des Dames_, Lyon,\r\n1503, _ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2633: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 272. _Chronique\r\nnormande_, in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Chartes_, second series,\r\nvol. iii, p. 116. D. Calmet, _Histoire de Lorraine_, p. vi, proofs and\r\nillustrations. G. Save, _Jehanne des Armoises_, pp. 6, 7. It is well\r\nknown that Gabriel Naude maintained the paradox that Jeanne was only\r\nburned in effigy. _Considerations politiques sur les coups d'etat_,\r\nRome, 1639, in 4to. G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p.\r\n8.]\r\n\r\nThus, when throughout Germany and France the rumour spread that the\r\nMaid was alive and had been seen near Metz, the tidings were variously\r\nreceived. Some believed them, others did not. An ardent dispute, which\r\narose between two citizens of Arles, gives some idea of the emotion\r\naroused by such tidings. One maintained that the Maid was still alive;\r\nthe other asserted that she was dead; each one wagered that what he\r\nsaid was true. This was no light wager, for it was made and registered\r\nin the presence of a notary, on the 27th of June, 1436, only five\r\nweeks after the interview at La Grange-aux-Ormes.[2634]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2634: Lanery d'Arc, _Le culte de Jeanne d'Arc_, Orleans,\r\n1887, in 8vo. _Revue du Midi._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the beginning of August, the Maid's eldest brother, Jean\r\ndu Lys, called Petit-Jean, had gone to Orleans to announce that his\r\nsister was alive. As a reward for these good tidings, he received for\r\nhimself and his followers ten pints of wine, twelve hens, two\r\ngoslings, and two leverets.[2635]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2635: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 275. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol.\r\nii, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nThe birds had been purchased by two magistrates; the name of one,\r\nPierre Baratin, is to be found in the account books of the fortress,\r\nin 1429,[2636] at the time of the expedition to Jargeau; the other was\r\nan old man of sixty-six, a burgess passing rich, Aignan de\r\nSaint-Mesmin.[2637]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2636: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 262. Lecoy de la Marche, _Jeanne\r\ndes Armoises_, p. 568.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2637: He died at the age of one hundred and eighteen.\r\n_Trial_, iii, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nMessengers were passing to and fro between the town of Duke Charles\r\nand the town of the Duchess of Luxembourg. On the 9th of August a\r\nletter from Arlon reached Orleans. About the middle of the month a\r\npursuivant arrived at Arlon. He was called Coeur-de-Lis, in honour\r\nof the heraldic symbol of the city of Orleans, which was a lily-bud, a\r\nkind of trefoil. The magistrates of Orleans had sent him to Jeanne\r\nwith a letter, the contents of which are unknown. Jeanne gave him a\r\nletter for the King, in which she probably requested an audience. He\r\ntook it straight to Loches, where King Charles was negotiating the\r\nbetrothal of his daughter Yolande to Prince Amedee of Savoie.[2638]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2638: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 326. Vallet de Viriville,\r\n_Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. ii, p. 376, note. G. Lefevre-Pontalis,\r\n_La fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 23, note 5.]\r\n\r\nAfter forty-one days' journey the pursuivant returned to the\r\nmagistrates, who had despatched him on the 2nd of September. The\r\nmessenger complained of a great thirst, wherefore the magistrates,\r\naccording to their wont, had him served in the chamber of the\r\ntown-hall with bread, wine, pears, and green walnuts. This repast cost\r\nthe town two _sous_ four _deniers_ of Paris, while the pursuivant's\r\ntravelling expenses amounted to six _livres_ which were paid in the\r\nfollowing month. The town varlet who provided the walnuts was that\r\nsame Jacquet Leprestre who had served during the siege. Another letter\r\nfrom the Maid had been received by the magistrates on the 25th of\r\nAugust.[2639]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2639: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 327.]\r\n\r\nJean du Lys proceeded just as if his miracle-working sister had in\r\nvery deed been restored to him. He went to the King, to whom he\r\nannounced the wonderful tidings. Charles cannot have entirely\r\ndisbelieved them since he ordered Jean du Lys to be given a gratuity\r\nof one hundred francs. Whereupon Jean promptly demanded these hundred\r\nfrancs from the King's treasurer, who gave him twenty. The coffers of\r\nthe victorious King were not full even then.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to Orleans, Jean appeared before the town-council. He\r\ngave the magistrates to wit that he had only eight francs, a sum by no\r\nmeans sufficient to enable him and four retainers to return to\r\nLorraine. The magistrates gave him twelve francs.[2640]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2640: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 326. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i,\r\npp. 284-285.]\r\n\r\nEvery year until then the anniversary of the Maid had been celebrated\r\nin the church of Saint-Sanxon[2641] on the eve of Corpus Christi and\r\non the previous day. In 1435, eight ecclesiastics of the four\r\nmendicant orders sang a mass for the repose of Jeanne's soul. In this\r\nyear, 1436, the magistrates had four candles burnt, weighing together\r\nnine and a half pounds, and pendent therefrom the Maid's escutcheon, a\r\nsilver shield bearing the crown of France. But when they heard the\r\nMaid was alive they cancelled the arrangements for a funeral service\r\nin her memory.[2642]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2641: Since 1432. But there is no evidence of any\r\nanniversary service having been held in 1433 and 1434. It was\r\nreinstituted in 1439.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2642: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 274, 275. Lottin, _Recherches_,\r\nvol. i, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were occurring in France, Jeanne was still with the\r\nDuchess of Luxembourg. There she met the young Count Ulrich of\r\nWurtemberg, who refused to leave her. He had a handsome cuirasse made\r\nfor her and took her to Cologne. She still called herself the Maid of\r\nFrance sent by God.[2643]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2643: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 323. Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p.\r\n325. Lecoy de la Marche, _loc. cit._, p. 566.]\r\n\r\nSince the 24th of June, Saint John the Baptist's Day, her power had\r\nreturned to her. Count Ulrich, recognising her supernatural gifts,\r\nentreated her to employ them on behalf of himself and his friends.\r\nBeing very contentious, he had become seriously involved in the schism\r\nwhich was then rending asunder the diocese of Treves. Two prelates\r\nwere contending for the see; one, Udalric of Manderscheit, appointed\r\nby the chapter, the other Raban of Helmstat, Bishop of Speyer,\r\nappointed by the Pope.[2644] Udalric took the field with a small force\r\nand twice besieged and bombarded the town of which he called himself\r\nthe true shepherd. These proceedings brought the greater part of the\r\ndiocese on to his side.[2645] But although aged and infirm, Raban too\r\nhad weapons; they were spiritual but powerful: he pronounced an\r\ninterdict against all such as should espouse the cause of his rival.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2644: _Art de verifier les dates_, vol. xv, pp. 236 _et\r\nseq._ _Gallia Christiana_, vol. xiii, pp. 970 _et seq._; Gams, _Series\r\nEpiscoporum_ (1873), pp. 317, 319.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2645: Quicherat, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p. 502, note,\r\nerroneously states that the contest for the Archbishopric of Treves\r\nwas between Raban of Helmstat and Jacques of Syrck. Concerning Jacques\r\nof Syrck or Sierck, see de Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol.\r\niv, p. 264.]\r\n\r\nCount Ulrich of Wurtemberg, who was among the most zealous of\r\nUdalric's supporters, questioned the Maid of God concerning him.[2646]\r\nSimilar cases had been submitted to the first Jeanne when she was in\r\nFrance. She had been asked, for example, which of the three popes,\r\nBenedict, Martin, or Clement, was the true father of the faithful, and\r\nwithout immediately pronouncing on the subject she had promised to\r\ndesignate the Pope to whom obedience was due, after she had reached\r\nParis and rested there.[2647] The second Jeanne replied with even more\r\nassurance; she declared that she knew who was the true archbishop and\r\nboasted that she would enthrone him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2646: Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, book v, ch. viii. D.\r\nCalmet, _Histoire de Lorraine_, vol. ii, p. 906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2647: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 245-246.]\r\n\r\nAccording to her, it was Udalric of Manderscheit, he whom the Chapter\r\nhad appointed. But when Udalric was summoned before the Council of\r\nBale, he was declared an usurper; and the fathers did what it was by\r\nno means their unvarying rule to do,--they confirmed the nomination of\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Maid's intervention in this dispute attracted the\r\nattention of the Inquisitor General of the city of Cologne, Heinrich\r\nKalt Eysen, an illustrious professor of theology. He inquired into the\r\nrumours which were being circulated in the city touching the young\r\nprince's protegee; and he learnt that she wore unseemly apparel,\r\ndanced with men, ate and drank more than she ought, and practised\r\nmagic. He was informed notably that in a certain assembly the Maid\r\ntore a table-cloth and straightway restored it to its original\r\ncondition, and that having broken a glass against the wall she with\r\nmarvellous skill put all its pieces together again. Such deeds caused\r\nKalt Eysen to suspect her strongly of heresy and witchcraft. He\r\nsummoned her before his tribunal; she refused to appear. This\r\ndisobedience displeased the Inquisitor General, and he sent to fetch\r\nthe defaulter. But the young Count of Wurtemberg hid his Maid in his\r\nhouse, and afterwards contrived to get her secretly out of the town.\r\nThus she escaped the fate of her whom she was willing only partially\r\nto imitate. As he could do nothing else, the Inquisitor excommunicated\r\nher.[2648] She took refuge at Arlon with her protectress, the Duchess\r\nof Luxembourg. There she met Robert des Armoises, Lord of Tichemont.\r\nShe may have seen him before, in the spring, at Marville, where he\r\nusually resided. This nobleman was probably the son of Lord Richard,\r\nGovernor of the Duchy of Bar in 1416. Nothing is known of him, save\r\nthat he surrendered this territory to the foreigner without the Duke\r\nof Bar's consent, and then beheld it confiscated and granted to the\r\nLord of Apremont on condition that he should conquer it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2648: Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, in _Trial_, vol. iv, p.\r\n502; vol. v, p. 324.]\r\n\r\nIt was not extraordinary that Lord Robert should be at Arlon, seeing\r\nthat his chateau of Tichemont was near this town. He was poor, albeit\r\nof noble birth.[2649]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2649: H. Vincent, _La maison des Armoises, originaire de\r\nChampagne_, in _Memoires de la Societe d'Archeologie Lorraine_, 3rd\r\nseries, vol. v (1877), p. 324. G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La fausse Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, p. 2, note 4.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called Maid married him,[2650] apparently with the approval of\r\nthe Duchess of Luxembourg. According to the opinion of the Holy\r\nInquisitor of Cologne, this marriage was contracted merely to protect\r\nthe woman against the interdict and to save her from the sword of the\r\nChurch.[2651]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2650: In his _Histoire de Lorraine_ (vol. v, pp. clxiv _et\r\nseq._), Dom Calmet says that the contract of marriage between Robert\r\ndes Armoises and the Maid of France, which had long been preserved in\r\nthe family, was lost in his day. There is no need to regret it, for it\r\nis now known that this contract was forged by Father Jerome Vignier.\r\nLe Comte de Marsy (_La fausse Jeanne d'Arc, Claude des Armoises; du\r\ndegre de confiance a accorder aux decouvertes de Jerome Vignier_,\r\nCompiegne, 1890) and M. Tamizey de Larroque (_Revue critique_, the\r\n20th October, 1890). For Vignier's other forgeries cf. Julien Havet,\r\n_Questions Merovingiennes_, ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2651: Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, bk. v, ch. viii. _Trial_,\r\nvol. iv, pp. 503, 504.]\r\n\r\nSoon after her marriage she went to live at Metz in her husband's\r\nhouse, opposite the church of Sainte-Segolene, over the Sainte-Barbe\r\nGate. Henceforth she was Jeanne du Lys, the Maid of France, the Lady\r\nof Tichemont. By these names she is described in a contract dated the\r\n7th of November, 1436, by which Robert des Armoises and his wife,\r\nauthorised by him, sell to Collard de Failly, squire, dwelling at\r\nMarville, and to Poinsette, his wife, one quarter of the lordship of\r\nHaraucourt. At the request of their dear friends, Messire Robert and\r\nDame Jeanne, Jean de Thoneletil, Lord of Villette, and Saubelet de\r\nDun, Provost of Marville, as well as the vendors, put their seals to\r\nthe contract to testify to its validity.[2652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2652: The preceding deed, by which \"_Robert des Harmoises et\r\nla Pucelle Jehanne d'Arc, sa femme_,\" acquired the estate of Fleville,\r\nis very doubtful (D. Calmet, 2nd edition, vol. v, p. clxiv, note).]\r\n\r\nIn her dwelling, opposite the Sainte-Segolene Church, la Dame des\r\nArmoises gave birth to two children.[2653] Somewhere in\r\nLanguedoc[2654] there was an honest squire who, when he heard of these\r\nbirths, seriously doubted whether Jeanne the Maid and la Dame des\r\nArmoises could be one and the same person. This was Jean d'Aulon, who\r\nhad once been Jeanne's steward. From information he had received from\r\nwomen who knew, he did not believe her to be the kind of woman likely\r\nto have children.[2655]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2653: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, p. 323. _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 354-355.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2654: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 206, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2655: _Ibid._, p. 219.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Brother Jean Nider, doctor in theology of the University\r\nof Vienne, this fruitful union turned out badly. A priest, and, as he\r\nsays, a priest who might more appropriately be called a pander,\r\nseduced this witch with words of love and carried her off. But Brother\r\nJean Nider adds that the priest secretly took la Dame des Armoises to\r\nMetz and there lived with her as his concubine.[2656] Now it is proved\r\nthat her own home was in that very town; hence we may conclude that\r\nthis friar preacher does not know what he is talking about.[2657]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2656: Jean Nider, _Formicarium_, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2657: _Chronique du doyen de Saint-Thibaud_, in _Trial_,\r\nvol. v, pp. 323-324.]\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that she did not remain longer than two\r\nyears in the shadow of Sainte-Segolene.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had married, it was by no means her intention to forswear\r\nprophesying and chivalry. During her trial Jeanne had been asked by\r\nthe examiner: \"Jeanne, was it not revealed to you that if you lost\r\nyour virginity your good fortune would cease and your Voices desert\r\nyou?\" She denied that such things had been revealed to her. And when\r\nhe insisted, asking her whether she believed that if she were married\r\nher Voices would still come to her, she answered like a good\r\nChristian: \"I know not, and I appeal to God.\"[2658] Jeanne des\r\nArmoises likewise held that good fortune had not forsaken her on\r\naccount of her marriage. Moreover, in those days of prophecy there\r\nwere both widows and married women who, like Judith of Bethulia, acted\r\nby divine inspiration. Such had been Dame Catherine de la Rochelle,\r\nalthough perhaps after all she had not done anything so very\r\ngreat.[2659]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2658: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2659: _Ibid._, vol. i, pp. 106, 108, 119, 296. _Journal d'un\r\nbourgeois de Paris._]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1439, la Dame des Armoises went to Orleans. The\r\nmagistrates offered her wine and meat as a token of gladness and\r\ndevotion. On the first of August they gave her a dinner and presented\r\nher with two hundred and ten livres of Paris as an acknowledgment of\r\nthe service she had rendered to the town during the siege. These are\r\nthe very terms in which this expenditure is entered in the account\r\nbooks of that city.[2660]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2660: Extracts from the accounts of the town of Orleans, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 331-332. Lecoy de la Marche, _Une fausse Jeanne\r\nd'Arc_, pp. 570-571.]\r\n\r\nIf the folk of Orleans did actually take her for the real Maid,\r\nJeanne, then it must have been more on account of the evidence of the\r\nDu Lys brothers, than on that of their own eyes. For, when one comes\r\nto think of it, they had seen her but very seldom. During that week in\r\nMay, she had only appeared before them armed and on horseback.\r\nAfterwards in June, 1429, and January, 1430, she had merely passed\r\nthrough the town. True it was she had been offered wine and the\r\nmagistrates had sat at table with her;[2661] but that was nine years\r\nago. And the lapse of nine years works many a change in a woman's\r\nface. They had seen her last as a young girl, now they found her a\r\nwoman and the mother of two children. Moreover they were guided by the\r\nopinion of her kinsfolk. Their attitude provokes some astonishment,\r\nhowever, when one thinks of the conversation at the banquet, and of\r\nthe awkward and inconsistent remarks the dame must have uttered. If\r\nthey were not then undeceived, these burgesses must have been passing\r\nsimple and strongly prejudiced in favour of their guest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2661: Original documents of Orleans, in _Trial_, vol. v, p.\r\n270.]\r\n\r\nAnd who can say that they were not? Who can say that, after having\r\ngiven credence to the tidings brought by Jean du Lys, the townsfolk\r\ndid not begin to discover the imposture? That the belief in the\r\nsurvival of Jeanne was by no means general in the city, during the\r\nvisit of la Dame des Armoises, is proved by the entries in the\r\nmunicipal accounts of sums expended on the funeral services, which we\r\nhave already mentioned. Supposing we abstract the years 1437 and 1438,\r\nthe anniversary service had at any rate been held in 1439, two days\r\nbefore Corpus-Christi, and only about three months before the banquet\r\non the 1st of August.[2662] Thus these grateful burgesses of Orleans\r\nwere at one and the same time entertaining their benefactress at\r\nbanquets and saying masses in memory of her death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2662: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 274. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i,\r\np. 286.]\r\n\r\nLa Dame des Armoises only spent a fortnight with them. She left the\r\ncity towards the end of July. Her departure would seem to have been\r\nhasty and sudden. She was invited to a supper, at which she was to\r\nhave been presented with eight pints of wine, but when the wine was\r\nserved she had gone, and the banquet had to be held without her.[2663]\r\nJean Quillier and Thevanon of Bourges were present. This Thevanon may\r\nhave been that Thevenin Villedart, with whom Jeanne's brothers dwelt\r\nduring the siege.[2664] In Jean Quillier we recognise the young draper\r\nwho, in June, 1429, had furnished fine Brussels cloth of purple,\r\nwherewith to make a gown for the Maid.[2665]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2663: Extracts from the accounts of the town of Orleans, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, pp. 331-332. Lottin, _Recherches_, vol. i, p. 287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2664: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 260.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2665: _Ibid._, pp. 112-113.]\r\n\r\nLa Dame des Armoises had gone to Tours, where she gave herself out to\r\nbe the true Jeanne. She gave the Bailie of Touraine a letter for the\r\nKing; and the Bailie undertook to see that it was delivered to the\r\nPrince, who was then at Orleans, having arrived there but shortly\r\nafter Jeanne's departure. The Bailie of Touraine in 1439 was none\r\nother than that Guillaume Bellier who ten years before as lieutenant\r\nof Chinon had received the Maid into his house and committed her to\r\nthe care of his devout wife.[2666]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2666: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 17; vol. v, p. 327.]\r\n\r\nTo the messenger, who bore this letter, Guillaume Bellier also gave a\r\nnote for the King written by himself, and \"touching the deeds of la\r\nDame des Armoises.\"[2667] We know nothing of its purport.[2668]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2667: _Ibid._, vol. v, p. 332. G. Lefevre-Pontalis, _La\r\nfausse Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 23-24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2668: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 332.]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the Dame went off into Poitou. There she placed\r\nherself at the service of Seigneur Gille de Rais, Marshal of\r\nFrance.[2669] He it was who in his early youth had conducted the Maid\r\nto Orleans, had been with her throughout the coronation campaign, had\r\nfought at her side before the walls of Paris. During Jeanne's\r\ncaptivity he had occupied Louviers and pushed on boldly to Rouen. Now\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of his vast domains he was\r\nkidnapping children, mingling magic with debauchery, and offering to\r\ndemons the blood and the limbs of his countless victims. His monstrous\r\ndoings spread terror round his castles of Tiffauges and Machecoul, and\r\nalready the hand of the Church was upon him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2669: Vallet de Viriville, _Notices et extraits de chartes\r\net de manuscrits appartenant au British Museum_, in _Bibliotheque de\r\nl'Ecole des Chartes_, vol. viii, 1846, p. 116.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Holy Inquisitor of Cologne, la Dame des Armoises\r\npractised magic; but it was not as an invoker of demons that the\r\nMarechal de Rais employed her; he placed her in authority over the\r\nmen-at-arms,[2670] in somewhat the same position as Jeanne had\r\noccupied at Lagny and Compiegne. Did she do great prowess? We do not\r\nknow. At any rate she did not hold her office long; and after her it\r\nwas bestowed on a Gascon squire, one Jean de Siquemville.[2671] In the\r\nspring of 1440 she was near Paris.[2672]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2670: Abbe Bossard, _Gille de Rais_, p. 174.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2671: Pardon, in _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 332-334.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2672: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 335. Lecoy de la\r\nMarche, _Une fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 574.]\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years and a half the great town had been loyal to King\r\nCharles. He had entered the city, but had failed to restore it to\r\nprosperity. Deserted houses were everywhere falling into ruins; wolves\r\npenetrated into the suburbs and devoured little children.[2673] The\r\ntownsfolk, who had so recently been Burgundian, could not all forget\r\nhow the Maid in company with Friar Richard and the Armagnacs had\r\nattacked the city on the day of the Nativity of Our Lady. There were\r\nmany, doubtless, who bore her ill will and believed she had been\r\nburned for her sins; but her name no longer excited universal\r\nreprobation as in 1429. Certain even among her former enemies regarded\r\nher as a martyr to the cause of her liege lord.[2674] Even in Rouen\r\nsuch an opinion was not unknown, and it was much more likely to be\r\nheld in the city of Paris which had lately turned French. At the\r\nrumour that Jeanne was not dead, that she had been recognised by the\r\npeople of Orleans and was coming to Paris, the lower orders in the\r\ncity grew excited and disturbances were threatening.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2673: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 338 _et seq._\r\nDe Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iii, pp. 384 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2674: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, p. 270.]\r\n\r\nUnder Charles of Valois in 1440, the spirit of the University was just\r\nthe same as it had been under Henry of Lancaster in 1431. It honoured\r\nand respected the King of France, the guardian of its privileges and\r\nthe defender of the liberties of the Gallican Church. The illustrious\r\nmasters felt no remorse at having demanded and obtained the\r\nchastisement of the rebel and heretic, Jeanne the Maid. Whosoever\r\npersists in error is a heretic; whosoever essays and fails to\r\noverthrow the powers that be is a rebel. It was God's will that in\r\n1440 Charles of Valois should possess the city of Paris; it had not\r\nbeen God's will in 1429; wherefore the Maid had striven against God.\r\nWith equal bitterness would the University, in 1440, have proceeded\r\nagainst a Maid of the English.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates who had returned to their Paris homes from their long\r\ndreary exile at Poitiers sat in the Parlement side by side with the\r\nconverted Burgundians.[2675] In the days of adversity these faithful\r\nservants of King Charles had set the Maid to work, but now in 1440 it\r\nwas none of their business to maintain publicly the truth of her\r\nmission and the purity of her faith. Burned by the English, that was\r\nall very well. But a trial conducted by a bishop and a vice-inquisitor\r\nwith the concurrence of the University is not an English trial; it is\r\na trial at once essentially Gallican and essentially Catholic.\r\nJeanne's name was forever branded throughout Christendom. That\r\necclesiastical sentence could be reversed by the Pope alone. But the\r\nPope had no intention of doing this. He was too much afraid of\r\ndispleasing the King of Catholic England; and moreover were he once to\r\nadmit that an inquisitor of the faith had pronounced a wrong sentence\r\nhe would undermine all human authority. The French clerks submit and\r\nare silent. In the assemblies of the clergy no one dares to utter\r\nJeanne's name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2675: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iii, ch.\r\nxvi.]\r\n\r\nFortunately for them neither the doctors and masters of the University\r\nnor the sometime members of the Parlement of Poitiers share the\r\npopular delusion touching la Dame des Armoises. They have no doubt\r\nthat the Maid was burned at Rouen. And they fear lest this woman, who\r\ngives herself out to be the deliverer of Orleans, may arouse a tumult\r\nby her entrance into the city. Wherefore the Parlement and the\r\nUniversity send out men-at-arms to meet her. She is arrested and\r\nbrought to the Palais.[2676]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2676: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 354, 355. Lecoy\r\nde la Marche, _Une fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 574.]\r\n\r\nShe was examined, tried and sentenced to be publicly exhibited. In the\r\nPalais de Justice, leading up from the court called the Cour-de-Mai,\r\nthere was a marble slab on which malefactors were exhibited. La Dame\r\ndes Armoises was put up there and shown to the people whom she had\r\ndeceived. The usual sermon was preached at her and she was forced to\r\nconfess publicly.[2677]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2677: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nShe declared that she was not the Maid, that she was married to a\r\nknight and had two sons. She told how one day, in her mother's\r\npresence, she heard a woman speak slightingly of her; whereupon she\r\nproceeded to attack the slanderer, and, when her mother restrained\r\nher, she turned her blows against her parent. Had she not been in a\r\npassion she would never have struck her mother. Notwithstanding this\r\nprovocation, here was a special case and one reserved for the papal\r\njurisdiction. Whosoever had raised his hand against his father or his\r\nmother, as likewise against a priest or a clerk, must go and ask\r\nforgiveness of the Holy Father, to whom alone belonged the power of\r\nconvicting or acquitting the sinner. This was what she had done. \"I\r\nwent to Rome,\" she said, \"attired in man's apparel. I engaged as a\r\nsoldier in the war of the Holy Father Eugenius, and in this war I\r\ntwice committed homicide.\"\r\n\r\nWhen had she journeyed to Rome? Probably before the exile of Pope\r\nEugenius to Florence, about the year 1433, when the condottieri of the\r\nDuke of Milan were advancing to the gates of the Eternal City.[2678]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2678: _Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris_, pp. 354, 355. Lecoy\r\nde la Marche, _Une fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 574. G. Lefevre-Pontalis,\r\n_La fausse Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nWe do not find either the University, or the Ordinary, or the Grand\r\nInquisitor demanding the trial of this woman, who was suspected of\r\nwitchcraft and of homicide, and who was attired in unseemly garments.\r\nShe was not prosecuted as a heretic, doubtless because she was not\r\nobstinate, and obstinacy alone constitutes heresy.\r\n\r\nHenceforth she attracted no further attention. It is believed, but on\r\nno very trustworthy evidence, that she ended by returning to Metz, to\r\nher husband, le Chevalier des Armoises, and that she lived quietly and\r\nrespectably to a good old age, dwelling in the house over the door of\r\nwhich were her armorial bearings, or rather those of Jeanne the Maid,\r\nthe sword, the crown and the Lilies.[2679]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2679: Vergnaud-Romagnesi, _Des portraits de Jeanne d'Arc et\r\nde la fausse Jeanne d'Arc_ and _Memoire sur les fausses Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nin _Les Memoires de la Societe d'Agriculture d'Orleans_, 1854, in\r\n8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe success of this fraud had endured four years. After all it is not\r\nso very surprising. In every age people have been loath to believe in\r\nthe final end of existences which have touched their imagination; they\r\nwill not admit that great personalities can be struck down by death\r\nlike ordinary folk; such an end to a noble career is repugnant to\r\nthem. Impostors, like la Dame des Armoises, never fail to find some\r\nwho will believe in them. And the Dame appeared at a time which was\r\nsingularly favourable to such a delusion; intellects had been dulled\r\nby long suffering; communication between one district and another was\r\nrendered impossible or difficult, and what was happening in one place\r\nwas unknown quite near at hand; in the minds of men there reigned\r\ndimness, ignorance, confusion.\r\n\r\nBut even then folk would not have been imposed upon so long by this\r\npseudo-Jeanne had it not been for the support given her by the Du Lys\r\nbrothers. Were they her dupes or her accomplices? Dull-witted as they\r\nmay have been, it seems hardly credible that the adventuress could\r\nhave imposed upon them. Admitting that she very closely resembled La\r\nRomee's daughter, the woman from La Grange-aux-Ormes cannot possibly\r\nfor any length of time have deceived two men who knew Jeanne\r\nintimately, having been brought up with her and come with her into\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIf they were not imposed upon, then how can we account for their\r\nconduct? They had lost much when they lost their sister. When he\r\narrived at La Grange-aux-Ormes, Pierre du Lys had just quitted a\r\nBurgundian prison; his ransom had been paid with his wife's dowry, and\r\nhe was then absolutely destitute.[2680] Jean, Bailie of Vermandois,\r\nafterwards Governor of Chartres and about 1436 Bailie of Vaucouleurs,\r\nwas hardly more prosperous.[2681] Such circumstances explained much.\r\nAnd yet it is unlikely that they of themselves alone and unsupported\r\nwould have played a game so difficult, so risky, and so dangerous.\r\nFrom the little we know of their lives we should conclude that they\r\nwere both too simple, too naif, too placid, to carry on such an\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2680: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 210, 213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2681: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 279.]\r\n\r\nWe are tempted to believe that they were urged on by some higher and\r\ngreater power. Who knows? Perhaps by certain indiscreet persons in the\r\nservice of the King of France. The condemnation and death of Jeanne\r\nwas a serious attack upon the prestige of Charles VII. May he not have\r\nhad in his household or among his counsellors certain subjects who\r\nwere rashly jealous enough to invent this appearance, in order to\r\nspread abroad the belief that Jeanne the Maid had not died the death\r\nof a witch, but that by virtue of her innocence and her holiness she\r\nhad escaped the flames? If this were so, then we may regard the\r\nimposture of the pseudo-Jeanne, invented at a time when it seemed\r\nimpossible ever to obtain a papal revision of the trial of 1431, as an\r\nattempt, surreptitious and fraudulent and speedily abandoned, to bring\r\nabout her rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nSuch a hypothesis would explain why the Du Lys brothers were not\r\npunished or even disgraced, when they had put themselves in the wrong,\r\nhad deceived King and people and committed the crime of high treason.\r\nJean continued provost of Vaucouleurs for many a long year, and then,\r\nwhen relieved of his office, received a sum of money in lieu of it.\r\nPierre, as well as his mother, La Romee, was living at Orleans. In 1443\r\nhe received from Duke Charles, who had returned to France three years\r\nbefore, the grant of an island in the Loire, l'Ile-aux-Boeufs,[2682]\r\nwhich was fair grazing land. Nevertheless, he remained poor, and was\r\nconstantly receiving help from the Duke and the townsfolk of Orleans.[2683]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2682: _Trial_, vol. v, pp. 212, 214.

Its manner of reforming at once the Church, its\r\nmembers, and its head struck terror into the hearts of the sovereign\r\nPontiff and the Sacred College. Sorrowfully did AEneus Sylvius exclaim,\r\n\"There is assembled at Bale, not the Church of God indeed, but the\r\nsynagogue of Satan.\"[2684] But though uttered by a Roman cardinal,\r\neven such an expression can hardly be termed violent when applied to\r\nthe synod which established free elections to bishoprics, suppressed\r\nthe right of bestowing the pallium, of exacting annates and payments\r\nto the papal chancery, and which was endeavouring to restore the\r\npapacy to evangelical poverty. The King of France and the Emperor, on\r\nthe other hand, looked favourably on the Council when it essayed to\r\nbridle the ambition and greed of the Bishop of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2684: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iii, p.\r\n335.]\r\n\r\nNow among the Fathers who displayed the greatest zeal in the\r\nreformation of the Church were the masters and doctors of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, those who had sat in judgment on Jeanne the Maid,\r\nand notably Maitre Nicolas Loiseleur and Maitre Thomas de Courcelles.\r\nCharles VII convoked an assembly of the clergy of the realm in order\r\nto examine the canons of Bale. The assembly met in the Sainte-Chapelle\r\nat Bourges, on the 1st of May, 1438. Master Thomas de Courcelles,\r\nappointed delegate by the Council, there conferred with the Lord\r\nBishop of Castres. Now in 1438 the Bishop of Castres was that elegant\r\nhumanist, that zealous counsellor of the crown, who, in style truly\r\nCiceronian, complained in his letters that so closely was he bound to\r\nhis glebe, the court, that no time remained to him to visit his\r\nspouse.[2685] He was none other than that Gerard Machet, the King's\r\nconfessor, who had, in 1429, along with the clerks at Poitiers,\r\npleaded the authority of prophecy in favour of the Maid, in whom he\r\nfound nought but sincerity and goodness.[2686] Maitre Thomas de\r\nCourcelles at Rouen had urged the Maid's being tortured and delivered\r\nto the secular arm.[2687] At the Bourges assembly the two churchmen\r\nagreed touching the supremacy of General Councils, the freedom of\r\nepiscopal elections, the suppression of annates and the rights of the\r\nGallican Church. At that moment it was not likely that either one or\r\nthe other remembered the poor Maid. From the deliberations of this\r\nassembly, in which Maitre Thomas played an important part, there\r\nissued the solemn edict promulgated by the King on the 7th of July,\r\n1438; the Pragmatic Sanction. By this edict the canons of Bale became\r\nthe constitution of the Church of France.[2688]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2685: Le P. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant l'eglise de son\r\ntemps_, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2686: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2687: _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 403.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2688: _Ordonnances_, vol. xiii, pp. 267, 291. _Preuves des\r\nlibertes de l'eglise gallicane_, edited by Lenglet-Dufresnoy, second\r\npart, p. 6. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iii, pp.\r\n353, 361. N. Arlos, _Histoire de la pragmatique sanction, etc._]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor also agreed to the reforms of Bale. So audacious did the\r\nFathers become that they summoned Pope Eugenius to appear before their\r\ntribunal. When he refused to obey their summons, they deposed him,\r\ndeclaring him to be disobedient, obstinate, rebellious, a breaker of\r\nrules, a perturber of ecclesiastical unity, a perjurer, a schismatic,\r\na hardened heretic, a squanderer of the treasures of the Church,\r\nscandalous, simoniacal, pernicious and damnable.[2689] Such was the\r\ncondemnation of the Holy Fathers pronounced among other doctors by\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles and Maitre Nicolas\r\nLoiseleur, who had all three so sternly reproached Jeanne with having\r\nrefused to submit to the Pope.[2690] Maitre Nicolas had been extremely\r\nenergetic throughout the Maid's trial, playing alternately the parts\r\nof the Lorraine prisoner and Saint Catherine; when she was led to the\r\nstake he had run after her like a madman.[2691] This same Maitre\r\nNicolas now displayed great activity in the Council wherein he\r\nattained to some eminence. He upheld the view that the General Council\r\ncanonically convoked, was superior to the Pope and in a position to\r\ndepose him. And albeit this canon was a mere master of arts, he made\r\nsuch an impression on the Fathers at Bale that in 1439, they\r\ndespatched him to act as juris-consult at the Diet of Mainz. Meanwhile\r\nhis attitude was strongly displeasing to the chapter which had sent\r\nhim as deputy to the Council. The canons of Rouen sided with the\r\nSovereign Pontiff and against the Fathers, on this point joining issue\r\nwith the University of Paris. They disowned their delegate and sent to\r\nrecall him on the 28th of July, 1438.[2692]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2689: Hefele, _Histoire de l'Eglise gallicane_, vol. xx, p.\r\n357.

But, unlike\r\nLoiseleur, he was not disowned by those who had appointed him, for he\r\nwas the deputy of the University of Paris who recognised the Pope of\r\nthe Council, Felix, to be the true Father of the Faithful.[2693] In\r\nthe assembly of the French clergy held at Bourges in the August of\r\n1440, Maitre Thomas spoke in the name of the Fathers of Bale. He\r\ndiscoursed for two hours to the complete satisfaction of the\r\nKing.[2694] Charles VII, while remaining loyal to Pope Eugenius,\r\nmaintained the Pragmatic Sanction. Maitre Thomas de Courcelles was\r\nhenceforth one of the pillars of the French Church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2693: J. Quicherat, _Apercus nouveaux_, p. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2694: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. iii, p.\r\n372.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the English government had declared for the Pope and against\r\nthe Council.[2695] My Lord Pierre Cauchon, who had become Bishop of\r\nLisieux, was Henry VI's ambassador at the Council. And at Bale a\r\nsomewhat unpleasant experience befell him. By reason of his\r\ntranslation to the see of Lisieux he owed Rome annates to the amount\r\nof 400 golden florins. In Germany he was informed by the Pope's\r\nTreasurer that by his failure to pay this sum, despite the long delays\r\ngranted to him, he had incurred excommunication, and that being\r\nexcommunicate, by presuming to celebrate divine service he had\r\ncommitted irregularity.[2696] Such accusations must have caused him\r\nconsiderable annoyance. But after all, such occurrences were frequent\r\nand of no great consequence. On churchmen these thunderbolts fell but\r\nlightly, doing them no great hurt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2695: De Beaurepaire, _Les etats de Normandie sous la\r\ndomination anglaise_, pp. 66, 67, 185, 188. De Beaucourt, _loc. cit._\r\np. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2696: De Beaurepaire, _loc. cit._, p. 17. _Notes sur les\r\njuges et assesseurs du proces de condamnation_, p. 117. _Recherches\r\nsur le proces_, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1444, the realm of France, disembarrassed alike of adversaries\r\nand of defenders, was free to labour, to work at various trades, to\r\nengage in commerce and to grow rich. In the intervals between wars and\r\nduring truces, King Charles's government, by the interchange of\r\nnatural products and of merchandise, also, we may add, by the\r\nabolition of tolls and dues on the Rivers Seine, Oise, and Loire,\r\neffected the actual conquest of Normandy. Thus, when the time for\r\nnominal conquest came, the French had only to take possession of the\r\nprovince. So easy had this become, that in the rapid campaign of\r\n1449,[2697] even the Constable was not beaten, neither was the Duke of\r\nAlencon. In his royal and peaceful manner Charles VII resumed\r\npossession of his town of Rouen, just as twenty years before he had\r\ntaken Troyes and Reims, as the result of an understanding with the\r\ntownsfolk and in return for an amnesty and the grant of rights and\r\nprivileges to the burghers. He entered the city on Monday, the 10th of\r\nNovember, 1449.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2697: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. v, ch.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\nThe French government felt itself strong enough even to attempt the\r\nreconquest of that essentially English province, Aquitaine. In 1451,\r\nmy Lord the Bastard, now Count of Dunois, took possession of the\r\nfortress of Blaye. Bordeaux and Bayonne surrendered in the same year.\r\nIn the following manner did the Lord Bishop of Le Mans celebrate these\r\nconquests, worthy of the majesty of the most Christian King.\r\n\r\n\"Maine, Normandy, Aquitaine, these goodly provinces have returned to\r\ntheir allegiance to the King. Almost without the shedding of French\r\nblood hath this been accomplished. It hath not been necessary to\r\noverthrow the ramparts of many strongly walled towns, or to demolish\r\ntheir fortifications or for the inhabitants to suffer either pillage\r\nor murder.\"[2698]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2698: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 249.]\r\n\r\nIndeed Normandy and Maine were quite content at being French once\r\nmore. The town of Bordeaux was alone in regretting the English, whose\r\ndeparture spelt its ruin. It revolted in 1452; and then after\r\nconsiderable difficulty was reconquered once and for all.\r\n\r\nKing Charles, henceforth rich and victorious, now desired to efface\r\nthe stain inflicted on his reputation by the sentence of 1431. He\r\nwanted to prove to the whole world that it was no witch who had\r\nconducted him to his coronation. He was now eager to appeal against\r\nthe condemnation of the Maid. But this condemnation had been\r\npronounced by the church, and the Pope alone could order it to be\r\ncancelled. The King hoped to bring the Pope to do this, although he\r\nknew it would not be easy. In the March of 1450, he proceeded to a\r\npreliminary inquiry;[2699] and matters remained in that position until\r\nthe arrival in France of Cardinal d'Estouteville, the legate of the\r\nHoly See. Pope Nicolas had sent him to negotiate with the King of\r\nFrance a peace with England and a crusade against the Turks. Cardinal\r\nd'Estouteville, who belonged to a Norman family, was just the man to\r\ndiscover the weak points in Jeanne's trial. In order to curry favour\r\nwith Charles, he, as legate, set on foot a new inquiry at Rouen, with\r\nthe assistance of Jean Brehal, of the order of preaching friars, the\r\nInquisitor of the Faith in the kingdom of France. But the Pope did not\r\napprove of the legate's intervention;[2700] and for three years the\r\nrevision was not proceeded with. Nicolas V would not allow it to be\r\nthought that the sacred tribunal of the most holy Inquisition was\r\nfallible and had even once pronounced an unjust sentence. And there\r\nexisted at Rome a stronger reason for not interfering with the trial\r\nof 1431: the French demanded revision; the English were opposed to it;\r\nand the Pope did not wish to annoy the English, for they were then\r\njust as good and even better Catholics than the French.[2701]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2699: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 1, 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2700: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. iii, col. 1129 and vol. xi,\r\ncol. 90. De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. v, p. 219. Le\r\nP. Ayroles, _La Pucelle devant l'eglise de son temps_, ch. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2701: De Beaurepaire, _Les etats de Normandie sous la\r\ndomination anglaise_, pp. 185, 188.]\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve the Pope from embarrassment and set him at his\r\nease, the government of Charles VII invented an expedient: the King\r\nwas not to appear in the suit; his place was to be taken by the family\r\nof the Maid. Jeanne's mother, Isabelle Romee de Vouthon, who lived in\r\nretirement at Orleans,[2702] and her two sons, Pierre and Jean du Lys,\r\ndemanded the revision.[2703] By this legal artifice the case was\r\nconverted from a political into a private suit. At this juncture\r\nNicolas V died, on the 24th of March, 1455. His successor, Calixtus\r\nIII, a Borgia, an old man of seventy-eight, by a rescript dated the\r\n11th of June, 1455, authorised the institution of proceedings. To this\r\nend he appointed Jean Jouvenel des Ursins, Archbishop of Reims,\r\nGuillaume Chartier, Bishop of Paris, and Richard Olivier, Bishop of\r\nCoutances, who were to act conjointly with the Grand Inquisitor of\r\nFrance.[2704]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2702: _Trial_, vol. v, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2703: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 108, 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2704: _Ibid._, p. 95.

Balme, _Jean Brehal,\r\ngrand inquisiteur de France et la rehabilitation de Jeanne d'Arc_,\r\nParis, 1893, in 4to.]\r\n\r\nFrom the first it was agreed that certain of those concerned in the\r\noriginal trial were not now to be involved, \"for they had been\r\ndeceived.\" Notably it was admitted that the Daughter of Kings, the\r\nMother of Learning, the University of Paris, had been led into error\r\nby a fraudulent indictment consisting of twelve articles. It was\r\nagreed that the whole responsibility should be thrown on to the Bishop\r\nof Beauvais and the Promoter, Guillaume d'Estivet, who were both\r\ndeceased. The precaution was necessary. Had it not been taken, certain\r\ndoctors very influential with the King and very dear to the Church of\r\nFrance would have been greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November, 1455, Isabelle Romee and her two sons,\r\nfollowed by a long procession of innumerable ecclesiasties, laymen,\r\nand worthy women, approached the church of Notre Dame in Paris to\r\ndemand justice from the prelates and papal commissioners.[2705]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2705: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 82, 92.]\r\n\r\nInformers and accusers in the trial of the late Jeanne were summoned\r\nto appear at Rouen on the 12th of December. Not one came.[2706] The\r\nheirs of the late Messire Pierre Cauchon declined all liability for\r\nthe deeds of their deceased kinsman, and touching the civil\r\nresponsibility, they pleaded the amnesty granted by the King on the\r\nreconquest of Normandy.[2707] As had been expected, the proceedings\r\nwent forward without any obstacle or even any discussion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2706: _Ibid._, pp. 92, 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2707: _Ibid._, pp. 193, 196.]\r\n\r\nInquiries were instituted at Domremy, at Orleans, at Paris, at\r\nRouen.[2708] The friends of Jeannette's childhood, Hauviette,\r\nMengette, either married or grown old; Jeannette, the wife of\r\nThevenin; Jeannette, the widow of Estellin; Jean Morel of Greux;\r\nGerardin of Epinal, the Burgundian, and his wife Isabellette, who had\r\nbeen godmother to Jacques d'Arc's daughter; Perrin, the bell-ringer;\r\nJeanne's uncle Lassois; the Leroyer couple and a score of peasants\r\nfrom Domremy all appeared. Bertrand de Poulengy, then sixty-three and\r\ngentleman of the horse to the King of France, was heard; likewise Jean\r\nde Novelompont, called Jean de Metz, who had been raised to noble rank\r\nand was now living at Vaucouleurs, where he held some military office.\r\nGentlemen and ecclesiasties of Lorraine and Champagne were\r\nexamined.[2709] Burgesses of Orleans were also called, and notably\r\nJean Luillier, the draper, who in June, 1429, had furnished fine\r\nBrussels cloth of purple for Jeanne's gown and ten years later had\r\nbeen present at the banquet given by the magistrates of Orleans in\r\nhonour of the Maid who, as it was believed, had escaped burning.[2710]\r\nJean Luillier was the most intelligent of the witnesses; as for the\r\nothers, of whom there were about two dozen townsmen and townswomen, of\r\nbetween fifty and sixty years of age, they did little but repeat his\r\nevidence.[2711] He spoke well; but the fear of the English dazzled him\r\nand he saw many more of them than there had ever been.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2708: _Ibid._, pp. 291, 463; vol. iii, pp. 1, 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2709: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 378, 463.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2710: _Ibid._, vol. v, pp. 112, 113, 331.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2711: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 23, 35.]\r\n\r\nTouching the examination at Poitiers there were called an advocate, a\r\nsquire, a man of business, Francois Garivel, who was fifteen at the\r\ntime of Jeanne's interrogation.[2712] The only cleric summoned was\r\nBrother Seguin of Limousin.[2713] The clerics of Poitiers were first\r\nas disinclined to risk themselves in this matter as were those of\r\nRouen; a burnt child dreads the fire. La Hire and Poton of\r\nSaintrailles were dead. The survivors of Orleans and of Patay were\r\ncalled; the Bastard Jean, now Count of Dunois and Longueville, who\r\ngave his evidence like a clerk;[2714] the old Sire de Gaucourt, who in\r\nhis eighty-fifth year made some effort of memory, and for the rest\r\ngave the same evidence as the Count of Dunois;[2715] the Duke of\r\nAlencon, on the point of making an alliance with the English and of\r\nprocuring a powder with which to dry up the King,[2716] but who was\r\nnone the less talkative and vain-glorious;[2717] Jeanne's steward,\r\nMessire Jean d'Aulon, who had become a knight, a King's Counsellor and\r\nSeneschal of Beaucaire,[2718] and the little page Louis de Coutes, now\r\na noble of forty-two.[2719] Brother Pasquerel too was called; even in\r\nhis old-age he remained superficial and credulous.[2720] And there was\r\nheard also the widow of Maitre Rene de Bouligny, Demoiselle Marguerite\r\nla Toroulde, who delicately and with a good grace related what she\r\nremembered.[2721]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2712: _Ibid._, pp. 1, 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2713: _Ibid._, vol. iii, p. 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2714: _Ibid._, pp. 2 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2715: _Ibid._, p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2716: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. vi, p.\r\n43.

As for the Vice Inquisitor of Religion, Brother Jean\r\nLemaistre, he might have been dead, so completely was he ignored.\r\nNevertheless, certain of the assessors were called: Jean Beaupere,\r\ncanon of Paris, of Besancon and of Rouen; Jean de Mailly, Lord Bishop\r\nof Noyon; Jean Lefevre, Bishop of Demetriade; divers canons of Rouen,\r\nsundry ecclesiastics who appeared some unctuous, others stern and\r\nfrowning;[2722] and, finally, the most illustrious Thomas de\r\nCourcelles, who, after having been the most laborious and assiduous\r\ncollaborator of the Bishop of Beauvais, recalled nothing when he came\r\nbefore the commissioners for the revision.[2723]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2722: _Ibid._, vol. ii, pp. 20, 21, 161; vol. iii, pp. 43,\r\n53, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2723: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 44, 56.

Among them was the Usher, Jean Massieu, a\r\ndissolute priest,[2725] of scandalous morals, but a kindly fellow for\r\nall that, albeit somewhat crafty and the inventor of a thousand\r\nridiculous stories against Cauchon, as if the old Bishop were not\r\nblack enough already.[2726] The revision commissioners produced a\r\ncouple of sorry monks, Friar Martin Ladvenu and Friar Isambart de la\r\nPierre, from the monastery of the preaching friars at Rouen. They wept\r\nin a heart-rending manner as they told of the pious end of that poor\r\nMaid, whom they had declared a heretic, then a relapsed heretic, and\r\nhad finally burned alive. There was not one of the clerks charged\r\nwith the examination of Jeanne but was touched to the heart at the\r\nmemory of so saintly a damsel.[2727]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2725: De Beaurepaire, _Notes sur les juges_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2726: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 329 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2727: _Trial_, vol. ii, pp. 363 _et seq._, 434 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nHuge piles of memoranda drawn up by doctors of high repute, canonists,\r\ntheologians and jurists, both French and foreign, were furnished for\r\nthe trial. Their chief object was to establish by scholastic reasoning\r\nthat Jeanne had submitted her deeds and sayings to the judgment of the\r\nChurch and of the Holy Father. These doctors proved that the judges of\r\n1431 had been very subtle and Jeanne very simple. Doubtless, it was\r\nthe best way to make out that she had submitted to the Church; but\r\nthey over-reached themselves and made her too simple. According to\r\nthem she was absolutely ignorant, almost an idiot, understanding\r\nnothing, imagining that the clerics who examined her in themselves\r\nalone constituted the Church Militant. This had been the impression of\r\nthe doctors on the French side in 1429. _La Pucelle_, \"_une puce_,\"\r\nsaid the Lord Archbishop of Embrun.[2728]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2728: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations en faveur de\r\nJeanne d'Arc_, p. 576.]\r\n\r\nBut there was another reason for making her appear as weak and\r\nimbecile as possible. Such a representation exalted the power of God,\r\nwho through her had restored the King of France to his inheritance.\r\n\r\nDeclarations confirming this view of the Maid were obtained by the\r\ncommissioners from most of the witnesses. She was simple, she was very\r\nsimple, she was absolutely simple, they repeated one after the other.\r\nAnd they all in the same words added: \"Yes, she was simple, save in\r\ndeeds of war, wherein she was well skilled.\"[2729] Then the captains\r\nsaid how clever she was in placing cannon, albeit they knew well to\r\nthe contrary. But how could she have failed to be well versed in deeds\r\nof war, since God himself led her against the English? And in this\r\npossession of the art of war by an unskilled girl lay the miracle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2729: _Trial_, vol. iii, pp. 32, 87, 100, 116, 119, 120,\r\n126, 128 _et passim_.]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Inquisitor of France, Jean Brehal, in his reminiscence\r\nenumerates the reasons for believing that Jeanne came from God. One of\r\nthe proofs which seems to have struck him most forcibly is that her\r\ncoming is foretold in the prophecies of Merlin, the Magician.[2730]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2730: Lanery d'Arc, _Memoires et consultations_, p. 402.]\r\n\r\nBelieving that he could prove from one of Jeanne's answers that her\r\nfirst apparitions were in her thirteenth year, Brother Jean Brehal\r\nargues that the fact is all the more credible seeing that this number\r\n13, composed of 3, which indicates the Blessed Trinity, and of 10,\r\nwhich expresses the perfect observation of the Decalogue, is\r\nmarvellously favourable to divine visitations.[2731]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2731: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 398.]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June, 1455, the sentence of 1431 was declared unjust,\r\nunfounded, iniquitous. It was nullified and pronounced invalid.\r\n\r\nThus was honour restored to the messenger of the coronation, thus was\r\nher memory reconciled with the Church. But that abundant source whence\r\non the appearance of this child there had flowed so many pious legends\r\nand heroic fables was henceforth dried up. The rehabilitation trial\r\nadded little to the popular legend. It rendered it possible to connect\r\nwith Jeanne's death the usual incidents narrated of the martyrdom of\r\nvirgins, such as the dove taking flight from the stake, the name of\r\nJesus written in letters of flame, the heart intact in the\r\nashes.[2732] The miserable deaths of the wicked judges were insisted\r\nupon. True it is that Jean d'Estivet, the Promoter, was found dead in\r\na dove-cot,[2733] that Nicolas Midi was attacked by leprosy, that\r\nPierre Cauchon died when he was being shaved.[2734] But, among those\r\nwho aided and accompanied the Maid, more than one came to a bad end.\r\nSire Robert de Baudricourt, who had sent Jeanne to the King, died in\r\nprison, excommunicated for having laid waste the lands of the chapter\r\nof Toul.[2735] The Marechal de Rais was sentenced to death.[2736] The\r\nDuke of Alencon, convicted of high treason, was pardoned only to fall\r\nunder a new condemnation and to die in captivity.[2737]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2732: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 355.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2733: _Ibid._, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2734: _Gallia Christiana_, vol. xi, col. 793.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2735: _Histoire ecclesiastique et politique de la ville et\r\ndu diocese de Toul_, 1707, p. 529.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2736: Abbe Bossard, _Gilles de Rais_, pp. 333 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2737: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. vi, p.\r\n197.]\r\n\r\nTwo years after Charles VII had ordered the preliminary inquiry into\r\nthe trial of 1431, a woman, following the example of la Dame des\r\nArmoises, passed herself off as the Maid Jeanne.\r\n\r\nAt this time there lived in the little town of Sarmaize, between the\r\nMarne and the Meuse, two cousins german of the Maid, Poiresson and\r\nPerinet, both sons of the late Jean de Vouthon, Isabelle Romee's\r\nbrother, who in his lifetime had been a thatcher by trade. Now, on a\r\nday in 1452, it befell that the cure of Notre Dame de Sarmaize, Simon\r\nFauchard, being in the market-house of the town, there came to him a\r\nwoman dressed as a youth who asked him to play at tennis with her.\r\n\r\nHe consented, and when they had begun their game the woman said to\r\nhim, \"Say boldly that you have played tennis with the Maid.\" And at\r\nthese words Simon Fauchard was right joyful.\r\n\r\nThe woman afterwards went to the house of Perinet, the carpenter, and\r\nsaid, \"I am the Maid; I come to visit my Cousin Henri.\"\r\n\r\nPerinet, Poiresson, and Henri de Vouthon made her good cheer and kept\r\nher in their house, where she ate and drank as she pleased.[2738]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2738: Inquiry of 1476, in G. de Braux and E. de Bouteiller,\r\n_Nouvelles recherches_, p. 10.]\r\n\r\nThen, when she had had enough, she went away.\r\n\r\nWhence came she? No one knows. Whither did she go? She may probably be\r\nrecognised in an adventuress, who not long afterwards, with her hair\r\ncut short and a hood on her head, wearing doublet and hose, wandered\r\nthrough Anjou, calling herself Jeanne the Maid. While the doctors and\r\nmasters, engaged in the revision of the trial, were gathering evidence\r\nof Jeanne's life and death from all parts of the kingdom, this false\r\nJeanne was finding credence with many folk. But she became involved in\r\ndifficulties with a certain Dame of Saumoussay,[2739] and was cast\r\ninto the prison of Saumur, where she lay for three months. At the end\r\nof this time, having been banished from the dominions of the good King\r\nRene, she married one Jean Douillet; and, by a document dated the 3rd\r\nday of February, 1456, she received permission to return to Saumur, on\r\ncondition of living there respectably and ceasing to wear man's\r\napparel.[2740]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2739: Or Chaumussay.

Her father's name was Jean\r\nFeron and she was commonly called Jeanne la Ferone.\r\n\r\nShe was inspired from heaven, and the names Jesus and Mary were for\r\never on her lips; yet the devil cruelly tormented her. The Dame de\r\nLaval, mother of the Lords Andre and Guy, being now very aged,\r\nmarvelled at the piety and the sufferings of the holy damsel; and she\r\nsent her to Le Mans, to the Bishop.\r\n\r\nSince 1449, the see of Le Mans had been held by Messire Martin\r\nBerruyer of Touraine. In his youth he had been professor of philosophy\r\nand rhetoric at the University of Paris. Later he had devoted himself\r\nto theology and had become one of the directors of the College of\r\nNavarre. Although he was infirm with age, his learning was such that\r\nhe was consulted by the commissioners for the rehabilitation\r\ntrial,[2741] whereupon he drew up a memorandum touching the Maid.\r\nHerein he believes her to have been verily sent of God because she was\r\nabject and very poor and appeared well nigh imbecile in everything\r\nthat did not concern her mission. Messire Martin argues that it was by\r\nreason of the King's virtues that God had vouchsafed to him the help\r\nof the Maid.[2742] Such an idea found favour with the theologians of\r\nthe French party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2741: _Trial_, vol. iii, p. 314, note 1. _Gallia\r\nChristiana_, vol. ii, fol. 518.

Many a\r\ntime did my Lord of Mans behold her covered with bleeding wounds,\r\nstruggling in the grasp of the enemy, and on several occasions he\r\ndelivered her by means of exorcisms. Greatly was he edified by this\r\nholy damsel, who made known unto him marvellous secrets, who abounded\r\nin pious revelations and noble Christian utterances. Wherefore in\r\npraise of La Ferone he wrote many letters[2743] to princes and\r\ncommunities of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2743: Du Clercq, _Memoires_, ed. Reiffenberg, Brussels,\r\n1823, vol. iii, pp. 98 _et seq._ Jean de Roye, _Chronique\r\nscandaleuse_, ed. Bernard de Mandrot, 1894, vol. i, pp. 13, 14.\r\n_Chronique de Bourdigne_, ed.

Dom\r\nPiolin, _Histoire de l'eglise du Mans_, vol. v, p. 163.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen of France, who was then very old and whose husband had long\r\nago deserted her, heard tell of the Maid of Le Mans, and wrote to\r\nMessire Martin Berruyer, requesting him to make the damsel known unto\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThus there befel, what we have seen happening over and over again in\r\nthis history, that when a devout person, leading a contemplative life\r\nuttered prophecies, those in places of authority grew curious\r\nconcerning her and desired to submit her to the judgment of the Church\r\nthat they might know whether the goodness that appeared in her were\r\ntrue or false. Certain officers of the King visited La Ferone at Le\r\nMans.\r\n\r\nAs revelations touching the realm of France had been vouchsafed to\r\nher, she spoke to them the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Commend me very humbly to the King and bid him recognise the grace\r\nwhich God granteth unto him, and lighten the burdens of his people.\"\r\n\r\nIn the December of 1460, she was summoned before the Royal Council,\r\nwhich was then sitting at Tours, while the King, who was sick of an\r\nulcer in the leg, was residing in the Chateau of Les Montils.[2744]\r\nThe Maid of Le Mans was examined in like manner as the Maid Jeanne had\r\nbeen, but the result was unfavourable; she was found wanting in\r\neverything. Brought before the ecclesiastical court she was convicted\r\nof imposture. It appeared that she was no maid, but was living in\r\nconcubinage with a cleric, that certain persons in the service of my\r\nLord of Le Mans instructed her in what she was to say, and that such\r\nwas the origin of the revelations she made to the Reverend Father in\r\nGod, Messire Martin Berruyer, under the seal of the confession.\r\nConvicted of being a hypocrite, an idolatress, an invoker of demons, a\r\nwitch, a magician, lascivious, dissolute, an enchantress, a mine of\r\nfalsehood, she was condemned to have a fool's cap put on her head and\r\nto be preached at in public, in the towns of Le Mans, Tours and Laval.\r\nOn the 2nd of May, 1461, she was exhibited to the folk at Tours,\r\nwearing a paper cap and over her head a scroll on which her deeds were\r\nset forth in lines of Latin and of French. Maitre Guillaume de\r\nChateaufort, Grand Master of the Royal College of Navarre, preached to\r\nher. Then she was cast into close confinement in a prison, there to\r\nweep over her sins for the space of seven years, eating the bread of\r\nsorrow and drinking the water of affliction;[2745] at the end of which\r\ntime she rented a house of ill fame.[2746]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2744: Chastellain, ed. Kervyn de Lettenhove, vol. iii, p.\r\n444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2745: Jacques du Clercq, _Memoires_, vol. iii, pp. 107 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2746: Antoine du Faur, _Livre des femmes celebres_, in\r\n_Trial_, vol. v, p. 336.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 22nd of July, 1461, covered with ulcers internal and\r\nexternal, believing himself poisoned and perhaps not without reason,\r\nCharles VII died, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, in his Chateau\r\nof Mehun-sur-Yevre.[2747]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2747: De Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII_, vol. vi, pp.\r\n442, 451. _Chronique Martiniane_, ed. P. Champion, p. 110.]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 6th of August, his body was borne to the Church of\r\nSaint-Denys in France and placed in a chapel hung with velvet; the\r\nnave was draped with black satin, the vault was covered with blue\r\ncloth embroidered with flowers-de-luce.[2748] During the ceremony,\r\nwhich took place on the following day, a funeral oration was delivered\r\non Charles VII. The preacher was no less a personage than the most\r\nhighly renowned professor at the University of Paris, the doctor, who\r\naccording to the Princes of the Roman Church was ever aimable and\r\nmodest, he who had been the stoutest defender of the liberties of the\r\nGallican Church, the ecclesiastic who, having declined a Cardinal's\r\nhat, bore to the threshold of an illustrious old age none other title\r\nthan that of Dean of the Canons of Notre Dame de Paris, Maitre Thomas\r\nde Courcelles.[2749] Thus it befell that the assessor of Rouen, who\r\nhad been the most bitterly bent on procuring Jeanne's cruel\r\ncondemnation, celebrated the memory of the victorious King whom the\r\nMaid had conducted to his solemn coronation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2748: Mathieu d'Escouchy, vol. ii, p. 422.

DUMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dear Master,--You ask for my medical opinion in the case of Jeanne\r\nd'Arc. Had I been able to examine it at my leisure with the Doctors\r\nTiphaine and Delachambre, who were summoned before the tribunal at\r\nRouen, I might have found it difficult to come to any definite\r\nconclusion. And even more difficult do I find it now, when my\r\ndiagnosis must necessarily be retrospective and based upon\r\nexaminations conducted by persons who never dreamed of attempting to\r\ndiscover the existence of any nervous disease. However since they\r\nascribed what we now call disease to the influence of the devil, their\r\nquestions are not without significance for us. Therefore with many\r\nreservations I will endeavour to answer your question.\r\n\r\nOf Jeanne's inherited constitution we know nothing; and of her\r\npersonal antecedents we are almost entirely ignorant. Our only\r\ninformation concerning such matters comes from Jean d'Aulon, who, on\r\nthe evidence of several women, states[2750] that she was never fully\r\ndeveloped, a condition which frequently occurs in neurotic subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2750: _Trial_, vol. iii. p. 219.]\r\n\r\nWe should, however, be unable to arrive at any conclusion concerning\r\nJeanne's nervous constitution had not her judges, and in particular\r\nMaitre Jean Beaupere, in the numerous examinations to which they\r\nsubjected her, elicited certain significant details on the subject of\r\nher hallucinations.\r\n\r\nMaitre Beaupere begins by inquiring very judiciously whether Jeanne\r\nhad fasted the day before she first heard her voices. Whence we infer\r\nthat the interdependence of inanition and hallucinations was\r\nrecognised by this illustrious professor of theology. Before\r\ncondemning Jeanne as a witch he wanted to make sure that she was not\r\nmerely suffering from weakness. Some time later we find Saint Theresa\r\nsuspecting that the visions said to have been seen by a certain nun\r\nwere merely the result of long fasting. Saint Theresa insisted on the\r\nnun's partaking of food, and the visions ceased.\r\n\r\nJeanne replies that she had only fasted since the morning, and Maitre\r\nBeaupere proceeds to ask:\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"In what direction did you hear the voice?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"I heard it on the right, towards the church.\"\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Was the voice accompanied by any light?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"I seldom heard it without there being a light. This light\r\nappeared in the direction whence the voice came.\"[2751]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2751: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52 and _passim_.]\r\n\r\nWe might wonder whether by the expression \"_a droite_\" (_a latere\r\ndextro_) Jeanne meant her own right side or the position of the church\r\nin relation to her; and in the latter case, the information would have\r\nno clinical significance; but the context leaves no doubt as to the\r\nveritable meaning of her words.\r\n\r\n\"How can you,\" urges Jean Beaupere, \"see this light which you say\r\nappears to you, if it is on your right?\"\r\n\r\nIf it had been merely a question of the situation of the church and\r\nnot of Jeanne's own right side, she would only have had to turn her\r\nface to see the light in front of her, and Jean Beaupere's objection\r\nwould have been pointless.\r\n\r\nConsequently at about the age of thirteen, at the period of puberty,\r\nwhich for her never came, Jeanne would appear to have been subject on\r\nher right side to unilateral hallucinations of sight and hearing. Now\r\nCharcot[2752] considered unilateral hallucinations of sight to be\r\ncommon in cases of hysteria.[2753] He even thought that in hysterical\r\nsubjects they are allied to a hemianaesthesia situated on the same side\r\nof the body, and which in Jeanne would be on the right side. Jeanne's\r\ntrial might have proved the existence of this hemianaesthesia, an\r\nextremely significant symptom in the diagnosis of hysteria, if the\r\njudges had applied torture or merely had examined the skin of the\r\nsubject in order to discover anaesthesia patches which were called\r\nmarks of the devil.[2754] But from the merely oral examination which\r\ntook place we can only draw inferences concerning Jeanne's general\r\nphysical condition. In case excessive importance should be attached to\r\nsuch inferences I should add that in the diagnosis of hysteria\r\ncontemporary neurologists pay less attention than did Charcot to\r\nunilateral hallucinations of sight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2752: A famous French alienist (1825-1893).--W.S.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2753: _Progres medical_, January 19, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2754: The existence of patches devoid of feeling was\r\nconsidered in the Middle Ages to prove that the subject was a witch.\r\nHence needles were run into the supposed witch. And if she felt them\r\nin every part of her body she was acquitted.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nThe other characteristics of Jeanne's hallucinations revealed by her\r\nexaminations during the trial are no less interesting than these,\r\nalthough they do not lead to any more certain conclusions.\r\n\r\nThose visions and voices, which the subject refers to an external\r\nsource and which are so characteristic of hysterical hallucinations,\r\nproceed suddenly from the subconscious self. Jeanne's conscious self\r\nwas so far from being prepared for her voices that she declares she\r\nwas very much afraid when she first heard them: \"I was thirteen when I\r\nheard a voice coming from God telling me to lead a good life. And the\r\nfirst time I was very much afraid. This voice came to me about noon;\r\nit was in the summer, in my father's garden.\"[2755]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2755: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 52.]\r\n\r\nAnd then straightway the voice becomes imperative. It demands an\r\nobedience which is not refused: \"It said to me: 'Go forth into\r\nFrance,' and I could no longer stay where I was.\"[2756]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2756: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nHer visions all occur in the same manner. They appeal to the senses in\r\nexactly the same way and are received by the Maid with equal\r\ncredulity.\r\n\r\nFinally, these hallucinations of hearing and of sight are soon\r\nassociated with similar hallucinations of smell and touch, which serve\r\nto confirm Jeanne's belief in their reality.\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Which part of Saint Catherine did you touch?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"You will hear nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Did you kiss or embrace Saint Catherine or Saint Margaret?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"I embraced them both.\"\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"In embracing them did you feel heat or anything?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"I could not embrace them without feeling and touching\r\nthem.\"[2757]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2757: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 186.]\r\n\r\nBecause they thus appeal to the senses and seem to possess a certain\r\nmaterial reality, hysterical hallucinations make a profound and\r\nineffaceable impression on those who experience them. The subjects\r\nspeak of them as being actual and very striking facts. When they\r\nbecome accusers, as so many women do who claim to have been the\r\nvictims of imaginary assaults, they support their assertions in the\r\nmost energetic fashion.\r\n\r\nNot only does Jeanne see, hear, smell and touch her saints, she joins\r\nthe procession of angels they bring in their train. With them she\r\nperforms actual deeds, as if there were perfect unity between her life\r\nand her hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\"I was in my lodging, in the house of a good woman, near the _chateau_\r\nof Chinon, when the angel came. And then he and I went together to the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Was this angel alone?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"This angel was with a goodly company of other angels.[2758]\r\nThey were with him, but not every one saw them.... Some were very much\r\nalike; others were not, or at any rate not as I saw them. Some had\r\nwings. Certain even wore crowns, and in their company were Saint\r\nCatherine and Saint Margaret. With the angel aforesaid and with the\r\nother angels they went right into the King's chamber.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2758: According to the evidence of Maitre Pierre Maurice, at\r\nthe condemnation trial (vol. i. p. 480), Jeanne must have seen the\r\nangels \"in the form of certain infinitesimal things\" (_sub specie\r\nquarumdam rerum minimarum_). This was also the character of the\r\nhallucinations experienced by Saint Rose of Lima (\"Vie de Sainte Rose\r\nde Lima,\" by P. Leonard Hansen, p. 179).]\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Tell us how the angel left you.\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"He left me in a little chapel, and at his departure I was very\r\nsorrowful, and I even wept. Willingly would I have gone away with him;\r\nI mean my soul would have gone.\"[2759]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2759: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 144.]\r\n\r\nIn all these hallucinations there is the same objective clearness, the\r\nsame subjective certitude as in toxic hallucinations; and this\r\nclearness, this certitude, may in Jeanne's case suggest hysteria.\r\n\r\nBut if in certain respects Jeanne resembles hysterical subjects, in\r\nothers she differs from them. She seems early to have acquired an\r\nindependence of her visions and an authority over them.\r\n\r\nWithout ever doubting their reality, she resists them and sometimes\r\ndisobeys them, when, for example, in defiance of Saint Catherine, she\r\nleaps from her prison of Beaurevoir: \"Well nigh every day Saint\r\nCatherine told me not to leap and that God would come to my aid, and\r\nalso would succour those of Compiegne. And I said to Saint Catherine:\r\n'Since God is to help those of Compiegne, I want to be with\r\nthem.'\"[2760]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2760: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 110.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion she assumes such authority over her visions that\r\nshe can make the two saints come at her bidding when they do not come\r\nof themselves.\r\n\r\n_Q._ \"Do you call these saints, or do they come without being called?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ \"They often come without being called, and sometimes when they\r\ndid not come I asked God to send them speedily.\"[2761]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2761: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 279 and _passim_.]\r\n\r\nAll this is not in the accepted manner of the hysterical, who are\r\nusually somewhat passive with regard to their nervous fits and\r\nhallucinations. But Jeanne's dominance over her visions is a\r\ncharacteristic I have noted in many of the higher mystics and in those\r\nwho have attained notoriety. This kind of subject, after having at\r\nfirst passively submitted to his hysteria, afterwards uses it rather\r\nthan submits to it, and finally by means of it attains in his ecstasy\r\nto that divine union after which he strives.\r\n\r\nIf Jeanne were hysterical, such a characteristic would help us to\r\ndetermine the part played by the neurotic side of her nature in the\r\ndevelopment of her character and in her life.\r\n\r\nIf there were any hysterical strain in her nature, then it was by\r\nmeans of this hysterical strain that the most secret sentiments of her\r\nheart took shape in the form of visions and celestial voices. Her\r\nhysteria became the open door by which the divine--or what Jeanne\r\ndeemed the divine--entered into her life. It strengthened her faith\r\nand consecrated her mission; but in her intellect and in her will\r\nJeanne remains healthy and normal. Nervous pathology can therefore\r\ncast but a feeble light on Jeanne's nature. It can reveal only one\r\npart of that spirit which your book resuscitates in its entirety. With\r\nthe expression of my respectful admiration, believe me, my dear\r\nmaster,\r\n\r\nDOCTOR G. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nTHE FARRIER OF SALON\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, there lived at\r\nSalon-en-Crau, near Aix, a farrier, one Francois Michel. He came of a\r\nrespectable family. He himself had served in the cavalry regiment of\r\nthe Chevalier de Grignan. He was held to be a sensible man, honest and\r\ndevout. He was close on forty when, in February, 1697, he had a\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nReturning to his home one evening, he beheld a spectre, holding a\r\ntorch in its hand. This spectre said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing. Go to Paris and speak to the King. If thou dost not\r\nobey this command thou shalt die. When thou shalt approach to within a\r\nleague of Versailles, I will not fail to make known unto thee what\r\nthings thou shalt say to his Majesty. Go to the Governor of thy\r\nprovince, who will order all that is necessary for thy journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure which thus addressed him was in the form of a woman. She\r\nwore a royal crown and a mantle embroidered with flowers-de-luce of\r\ngold, like the late Queen, Marie-Therese, who had died a holy death\r\nfull fourteen years before.\r\n\r\nThe poor farrier was greatly afraid. He fell down at the foot of a\r\ntree, knowing not whether he dreamed or was awake. Then he went back\r\nto his house, and told no man of what he had seen.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards he passed the same spot. There again he beheld\r\nthe same spectre, who repeated the same orders and the same threats.\r\nThe farrier could no longer doubt the reality of what he saw; but as\r\nyet he could not make up his mind what to do.\r\n\r\nA third apparition, more imperious and more importunate than the\r\nfirst, reduced him to obedience. He went to Aix, to the Governor of\r\nthe province; he saw him and told him how he had been given a mission\r\nto speak to the King. The Governor at first paid no great heed to him.\r\nBut the visionary's patient persistence could not fail to impress him.\r\nMoreover, since the King was personally concerned in the matter, it\r\nought not to be entirely neglected. These considerations led the\r\nGovernor to inquire from the magistrates of Salon touching the\r\nfarrier's family and manner of life. The result of these inquiries was\r\nvery favourable. Accordingly the Governor deemed it fitting to proceed\r\nforthwith to action. In those days no one was quite sure whether\r\nadvice, very useful to the most Christian of Kings, might not be sent\r\nby some member of the Church Triumphant through the medium of a common\r\nartisan. Still less were they sure that some plot in which the welfare\r\nof the State was concerned might not be hatched under colour of an\r\napparition. In both contingencies, the second of which was quite\r\nprobable, it would be advisable to send Francois Michel to Versailles.\r\nAnd this was the decision arrived at by the Governor.\r\n\r\nFor the transport of Francois Michel he adopted measures at once sure\r\nand inexpensive. He confided him to an officer who was taking recruits\r\nin that direction. After having received the communion in the church\r\nof the Franciscans, who were edified by his pious bearing, the farrier\r\nset out on February 25 with his Majesty's young soldiers, with whom he\r\ntravelled as far as La Ferte-sous-Jouarre. On his arrival at\r\nVersailles, he asked to see the King or at least one of his Ministers\r\nof State. He was directed to M. de Barbezieux, who, when he was still\r\nvery young, had succeeded his father, M. de Louvois, and in that\r\nposition had displayed some talent. But the good farrier declined to\r\ntell him anything, because he was not a Minister of State.\r\n\r\nAnd it was true that Barbezieux, although a Minister, was not a\r\nMinister of State. But that a farrier from Provence should be capable\r\nof drawing such a distinction occasioned considerable surprise.\r\n\r\nM. de Barbezieux doubtless did not evince such scorn for this\r\ncompatriot of Nostradamus as would have been shown in his place by a\r\nman of broader mind. For he, like his father, was addicted to the\r\npractice of astrology, and he was always inquiring concerning his\r\nhoroscope of a certain Franciscan friar who had predicted the hour of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether he gave the King a favourable report of the\r\nfarrier, or whether the latter was admitted to the presence of M. de\r\nPomponne, who was then at the head of the administration of Provence.\r\nBut we do know that Louis XIV consented to see the man. He had him\r\nbrought up the steps leading to the marble courtyard, and then granted\r\nhim a lengthy audience in his private apartments.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, as the King was coming down his private staircase on\r\nhis way out hunting, he met Marshal de Duras, who was Captain of the\r\nKing's bodyguard for the day. With his usual freedom of speech the\r\nMarshal spoke to the King of the farrier, using a common saying:\r\n\r\n\"Either the man is mad, or the King is not noble.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the King, contrary to his usual habit, paused and\r\nturned to the Marshal de Duras:\r\n\r\n\"Then I am not noble,\" he said, \"for I talked to him for a long time,\r\nand he spoke very sensibly; I assure you he is far from being mad.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words he uttered with so solemn a gravity that those who were\r\npresent were astonished.\r\n\r\nPersons who claim to be inspired are expected to show some sign of\r\ntheir mission. In a second interview, Francois Michel showed the King\r\na sign in fulfilment of a promise he had given. He reminded him of an\r\nextraordinary circumstance which the son of Anne of Austria believed\r\nknown to himself alone. Louis XIV himself admitted it, but for the\r\nrest preserved a profound silence touching this interview.\r\n\r\nSaint Simon, always eager to collect every court rumour, believed it\r\nwas a question of some phantom, which more than twenty years before\r\nhad appeared to Louis XIV in the Forest of Saint-Germain.\r\n\r\nFor the third and last time the King received the farrier of Salon.\r\n\r\nThe courtiers displayed so much curiosity in this visionary that he\r\nhad to be shut up in the monastery of Des Recollets. There the little\r\nPrincess of Savoy, who was shortly to marry the Duke of Burgundy, came\r\nto see him with several lords and ladies of the court.\r\n\r\nHe appeared slow to speak, good, simple, and humble. The King ordered\r\nhim to be furnished with a fine horse, clothes, and money; then he\r\nsent him back to Provence.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was divided on the subject of the apparition which had\r\nappeared to the farrier and the mission he had received from it. Most\r\npeople believed that he had seen the spirit of Marie-Therese; but some\r\nsaid it was Nostradamus.[2762]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2762: Michel de Nostre-Dame, called Nostradamus (1503-1566),\r\na Provencal astrologer, whose prophecies were published under the\r\ntitle of \"Centuries.\" He was invited to the French court by Catherine\r\nde' Medici, and became the doctor of Charles IX.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nIt was only at Salon, where he slept in the church of the Franciscans,\r\nthat this astrologer was absolutely believed in. His \"Centuries,\"\r\nwhich appeared at Paris and at Lyon in no less than ten editions in\r\nthe course of one century, entertained the credulous throughout the\r\nkingdom. In 1693, there had just been published a book of the\r\nprophecies of Nostradamus showing how they had been fulfilled in\r\nhistory from the reign of Henry II down to that of Louis the Great.\r\n\r\nIt came to be believed that in the following mysterious quatrain the\r\nfarrier's coming had been prophesied:\r\n\r\n    \"Le penultiesme du surnom du Prophete,\r\n    Prendra Diane pour son iour et repos:\r\n    Loing vaguera par frenetique teste,\r\n    En delivrant un grand peuple d'impos.\"[2763]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2763: The last syllable but one of the surname of the\r\nProphet will Diane take for her day and her rest. Far shall wander\r\nthat inspired one delivering a great nation from the burden of taxes.]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to apply these obscure lines to the poor prophet\r\nof Salon. In the first line he is said to figure as one of the twelve\r\nminor prophets, Micah, which name is closely allied to Michel. In the\r\nsecond line Diane was said to be the mother of the farrier, who was\r\ncertainly called by that name. But if the line means anything at all,\r\nit is more likely to refer to the day of the moon, Monday. It was\r\ncarefully pointed out that in the third line _frenetique_ means not\r\n_mad_ but _inspired_. The fourth and only intelligible line would\r\nsuggest that the spectre bade Michel ask the King to lessen the taxes\r\nand dues which then weighed so heavily on the good folk of town and\r\ncountry:\r\n\r\n_En delivrant un grand peuple d'impos._ This was enough to make the\r\nfarrier popular and to cause those unhappy sufferers to centre in this\r\npoor windbag their hopes for a better future. His portrait was\r\nengraved in copper-plate, and below it was written the quatrain of\r\nNostradamus. M. d'Argenson,[2764] who was at the head of the police\r\ndepartment, had these portraits seized. They were suppressed, so says\r\nthe _Gazette d'Amsterdam_, on account of the last line of the quatrain\r\nwritten beneath the portrait, the line which runs: _En delivrant un\r\ngrand peuple d'impos_. Such an expression was hardly likely to please\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2764: Marc Rene Marquis d'Argenson (1652-1721), after being\r\nLieutenant General de la Police at Paris, became, from 1718-1720,\r\nPresident du Conseil des Finances and Garde des Sceaux.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nNo one ever knew exactly what was the mission the farrier received\r\nfrom his spectre. Subtle folk suspected one of Madame de Maintenon's\r\nintrigues. She had a friend at Marseille, a Madame Arnoul, who was as\r\nugly as sin, it was said, and yet who managed to make men fall in love\r\nwith her. They thought that this Madame Arnoul had shown Marie-Therese\r\nto the good man of Salon in order to induce the King to live\r\nhonourably with widow Scarron. But in 1697 widow Scarron had been\r\nmarried to Louis for twelve years at least; and one cannot see why\r\nghostly aid should have been necessary to attach the old King to her.\r\n\r\nOn his return to his native town, Francois Michel shoed horses as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe died at Lancon, near Salon, on December 10, 1726.[2765]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2765: _Gazette d'Amsterdam_, March-May, 1697; _Annales de la\r\ncour et de Paris_ (vol. ii. pp. 204, 219); _Theatrum Europaeum_ (vol.\r\nxv. pp. 359-360); _Memoires de Sourches_ (vol. v. pp. 260, 263);\r\n_Lettres de Madame Dunoyer_ (Letter xxvi); _Saint Simon, Memoires_,\r\ned.

A native of\r\nGallardon in Eure-et-Loir, he dwelt there with his wife and four\r\nchildren in the beginning of the nineteenth century. Those who knew\r\nhim tell us that he was of average height, with brown straight hair, a\r\ncalm glance, a thin countenance and an air of quiet and assurance. A\r\npencil portrait, which his son, M. le Docteur Martin, has kindly sent\r\nme, gives a more exact idea of the visionary. The portrait, which is\r\nin profile, presents a forehead curiously high and straight, a long\r\nnarrow head, round eyes, broad nostrils, a compressed mouth, a\r\nprotruding chin, hollow cheeks and an air of austerity. He is dressed\r\nas a _bourgeois_, with a collar and white cravat.\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence of his brother, a man both physically and\r\nmentally sound, his was the gentlest of natures; he never sought to\r\nattract attention; in his regular piety there was nothing ecstatic.\r\nBoth the mayor and the priest of Gallardon confirmed this description.\r\nThey agreed in representing him to have been a good simple creature,\r\nwith an intellect well-balanced although not very active.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 he was thirty-three. On January 15 in this year he was alone\r\nin his field, over which he was spreading manure, when in his ear he\r\nheard a voice which had not been preceded by footsteps. Then he\r\nturned his head in the direction of the voice and saw a figure which\r\nalarmed him. In comparison with human size it was but slight; its\r\ncountenance, which was very thin, dazzled by its unnatural whiteness.\r\nIt was wearing a high hat and a frock-coat of a light colour, with\r\nlaced shoes.\r\n\r\nIt said in a kindly tone: \"You must go to the King; you must warn him\r\nthat his person is in danger, that wicked people are seeking to\r\noverthrow his Government.\"\r\n\r\nIt added further recommendations to Louis XVIII touching the\r\nnecessity of having an efficient police, of keeping holy the Sabbath,\r\nof ordering public prayers and of suppressing the disorders of the\r\nCarnival. If such measures be neglected, it said, \"France will fall\r\ninto yet greater misfortunes.\" All this was doubtless nothing more or\r\nless than what M. La Perruque, Priest of Gallardon, had a hundred\r\ntimes repeated from the pulpit on Sunday.\r\n\r\nMartin replied:\r\n\r\n\"Since you know so much about it, why don't you perform your errand\r\nyourself? Why do you appeal to a poor man like me who knows not how to\r\nexpress himself?\"\r\n\r\nThen the unknown replied to Martin:\r\n\r\n\"It is not I who will go, but you; do as I command you.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had uttered these words, his feet rose from the ground,\r\nhis body bent, and with this double movement he vanished.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onwards, Martin was haunted by the mysterious being.\r\nOne day, having gone down into his cellar, he found him there. On\r\nanother occasion, during vespers, he saw him in church, near the holy\r\nwater stoup, in a devout attitude. When the service was over, the\r\nunknown accompanied Martin on his way home and again commanded him to\r\ngo and see the King. The farmer told his relatives who were with him,\r\nbut neither of them had seen or heard anything.\r\n\r\nTormented by these apparitions, Martin communicated them to his\r\npriest, M. La Perruque. He, being certain of the good faith of his\r\nparishioner and deeming that the case ought to be submitted to the\r\ndiocesan authority, sent the visionary to the Bishop of Versailles.\r\nThe Bishop was then M. Louis Charrier de la Roche, a priest who in the\r\ndays of the Revolution had taken the oath to the Republic. He resolved\r\nto subject Martin to a thorough examination; and from the first he\r\ntold him to ask the unknown what was his name, and who it was who sent\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut when the messenger in the light-coloured frock-coat appeared\r\nagain, he declared that his name must remain unknown.\r\n\r\n\"I come,\" he added, \"from him who has sent me, and he who has sent me\r\nis above me.\"\r\n\r\nHe may have wished to conceal his name; but at least he did not\r\nconceal his views; the vexation he displayed on the escape of La\r\nValette[2766] proved that in politics he was an ultra Royalist of the\r\nmost violent type.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2766: Antoine Marie Chamans, Comte de La Valette\r\n(1769-1830), was a French general during the first empire. Having been\r\narrested in 1815 and condemned to death, he was saved by his\r\nwife.--W.S.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Comte de Breteuil, Prefect of Eure-et-Loir, had been\r\ntold of the visionary at the same time as the Bishop. He also\r\nquestioned Martin. He expected to find him a nervous, agitated person;\r\nbut when he found him tranquil, speaking simply, but with logical\r\nsequence and precision, he was very astonished.\r\n\r\nLike M. l'Abbe La Perruque he deemed the matter sufficiently important\r\nto bring before the higher authorities. Accordingly he sent Martin,\r\nunder the escort of a lieutenant of _gendarmerie_, to the Ministre de\r\nla Police Generale.\r\n\r\nHaving reached Paris on March 8, Martin lodged with the _gendarme_ at\r\nthe Hotel de Calais, in the Rue Montmartre. They occupied a\r\ndouble-bedded room. One morning, when Martin was in bed, he beheld an\r\napparition and told Lieutenant Andre, who could see nothing, although\r\nit was broad daylight. Indeed, Martin's visitations became so\r\nfrequent that they ceased to cause him either surprise or concern. It\r\nwas only to the abrupt disappearance of the unknown that he could\r\nnever grow accustomed. The voice continued to give the same command.\r\nOne day it told him that if it were not obeyed France would not know\r\npeace until 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 the Ministre de la Police Generale was the Comte Decazes who\r\nwas afterwards created a duke. He was in the King's confidence. But he\r\nknew that the extreme Royalists were hatching plots against his royal\r\nmaster. Decazes wished to see the good man from Gallardon, suspecting\r\ndoubtless, that he was but a tool in the hands of the Extremists.\r\nMartin was brought to the Minister, who questioned him and at once\r\nperceived that the poor creature was in no way dangerous. He spoke to\r\nhim as he would to a madman, endeavouring to regard the subject of his\r\nmania as if it were real, and so he said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be agitated; the man who has been troubling you is arrested;\r\nyou will have nothing more to fear from him.\"\r\n\r\nBut these words did not produce the desired effect. Three or four\r\nhours after this interview, Martin again beheld the unknown, who,\r\nafter speaking to him in his usual manner, said: \"When you were told\r\nthat I had been arrested, you were told a lie; he who said so has no\r\npower over me.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 10, the unknown returned; and on that day he\r\ndisclosed the matter concerning which the Bishop of Versailles had\r\ninquired, and which he had said at first he would never reveal.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" he declared, \"the Archangel Raphael, an angel of great renown\r\nin the presence of God, and I have received power to afflict France\r\nwith all manner of suffering.\"\r\n\r\nThree days later, Martin was shut up in Charenton on the certificate\r\nof Doctor Pinel, who stated him to be suffering from intermittent\r\nmania with alienation of mind.\r\n\r\nHe was treated in the kindest manner and was even permitted to enjoy\r\nsome appearance of liberty. Pinel himself originated the humane\r\ntreatment of the insane. Martin in the asylum was not forsaken by the\r\nblessed Raphael. On Friday, the 15th, as the peasant was tying his\r\nshoe laces, the Archangel in his frock-coat of a light colour, spoke\r\nto him these words:\r\n\r\n\"Have faith in God. If France persists in her incredulity, the\r\nmisfortunes I have predicted will happen. Moreover, if they doubt the\r\ntruth of your visions, they have but to cause you to be examined by\r\ndoctors in theology.\"\r\n\r\nThese words Martin repeated to M. Legros; Director of the Royal\r\nInstitution of Charenton, and asked him what a doctor in theology was.\r\nHe did not know the meaning of the term. In the same manner, when he\r\nwas at Gallardon he had asked the priest, M. La Perruque, the meaning\r\nof certain expressions the voice had used. For example, he did not\r\nunderstand the wild frenzy of France [_le delvie de la France_] nor\r\nthe evils to which she would fall a victim [_elle serait en proie_].\r\nBut there is nothing that need puzzle us in such ignorance, if it\r\nreally existed. Martin may well have remembered the words he did not\r\nunderstand and which he afterwards attributed to his Archangel still\r\nwithout understanding them.\r\n\r\nThe visions recurred at brief intervals. On Sunday, March 31, the\r\nArchangel appeared to him in the garden, took his hand, which he\r\npressed affectionately, opened his coat and displayed a bosom of so\r\ndazzling a whiteness that Martin could not bear to gaze on it. Then he\r\ntook off his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Behold my forehead,\" he said, \"and give heed that it beareth not the\r\nmark of the beast whereby the fallen angels were sealed.\"\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII expressed a desire to see Martin and to question him. The\r\nKing, like his favourite Minister, believed the visionary to be a tool\r\nin the hands of the extreme party.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, April 2, Martin was taken to the Tuileries and brought\r\ninto the King's closet, where was also M. Decazes. As soon as the King\r\nsaw the farmer, he said to him: \"Martin, I salute you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he signed to his Minister to withdraw. Thereupon Martin,\r\naccording to his own telling, repeated to the King all that the\r\nArchangel had revealed to him, and disclosed to Louis XVIII sundry\r\nsecret matters concerning the years he had spent in exile; finally he\r\nmade known to him certain plots which had been formed against his\r\nperson. Then the King, profoundly agitated and in tears, raised his\r\nhands and his eyes to heaven and said to Martin:\r\n\r\n\"Martin, these are things which must never be known save to you and to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThe visionary promised him absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the interview of April 2, according to the account given of\r\nit by Martin, who then, under the influence of M. La Perruque's\r\nsermons, was an infatuated Royalist. It would be interesting to know\r\nmore of this priest whose inspiration is obvious throughout the whole\r\nstory. Louis XVIII agreed with M. Decazes that the man was quite\r\nharmless; and he was sent back to his plough.\r\n\r\nLater, the agents of one of those false dauphins so numerous under the\r\nRestoration, got hold of Martin and made use of him in their own\r\ninterest. After Louis XVIII's death, under the influence of these\r\nadventurers, the poor man, reconstituting the story of his interview\r\nwith the late King, introduced into it other revelations he claimed to\r\nhave received and completely changed the whole character of the\r\nincident. In this second version the passionate Royalist of 1816 was\r\ntransformed into an accusing prophet, who came to the King's own\r\npalace to denounce him as a usurper and a regicide, forbidding him in\r\nGod's name to be crowned at Reims.\r\n\r\nSuch ramblings I cannot relate at length. They are to be found fully\r\ndetailed in the book of M. Paul Marin. The author of this work would\r\nhave done well to indicate that these follies were suggested to the\r\nunhappy man by the partisans of Naundorf, who was passing himself off\r\nas the Duke of Normandy, who had escaped from the Temple.\r\n\r\nThomas Ignace Martin died at Chartres in 1834.

From her we know that at\r\nArras she saw in the hands of a Scotsman a picture in which she was\r\nrepresented on her knees presenting a letter to her King. From her we\r\nknow also that she never caused to be made either image or painting of\r\nherself, and that she was not aware of the existence of any such image\r\nor painting. The portrait painted by the Scotsman, which was doubtless\r\nvery small, is unfortunately lost and no copy of it is known.[2768]\r\nThe slight pen-and-ink figure, drawn on a register of May 10, 1429, by\r\na clerk of the Parlement of Paris, who had never seen the Maid, must\r\nbe regarded as the mere scribbling of a scribe who was incapable of\r\neven designing a good initial letter.[2769] I shall not attempt to\r\nreconstruct the iconography of the Maid.[2770] The bronze equestrian\r\nstatue in the Cluny Museum produces a grotesque effect that one is\r\ntempted to believe deliberate, if one may ascribe such an intention to\r\nan old sculptor. It dates from the reign of Charles VIII. It is a\r\nSaint George or a Saint Maurice, which, at a time doubtless quite\r\nrecent, was taken to represent the Maid. Between the legs of the\r\nmiserable jade, on which the figure is mounted, was engraved the\r\ninscription: _La pucelle dorlians_, a description which would not\r\nhave been employed in the fifteenth century.[2771] About 1875, the\r\nCluny Museum exhibited another statuette, slightly larger, in painted\r\nwood, which was also believed to be fifteenth century, and to\r\nrepresent Jeanne d'Arc. It was relegated to the store-room, when it\r\nturned out to be a bad seventeenth-century Saint Maurice from a church\r\nat Montargis.[2772] Any saint in armour is frequently described as a\r\nJeanne d'Arc. This is what happened to a small fifteenth-century head\r\nwearing a helmet, found buried in the ground at Orleans, broken off\r\nfrom a statue and still bearing traces of painting: a work in good\r\nstyle and with a charming expression.[2773] I have not patience to\r\nrelate how many initial letters of antiphonaries and sixteenth-,\r\nseventeenth- and even eighteenth-century miniatures have been touched\r\nup or repainted and passed off as true and ancient representations of\r\nJeanne. Many of them I have had the opportunity of seeing.[2774] On\r\nthe other hand, if they were not so well known, it would give me\r\npleasure to recall certain manuscripts of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhich, like _Le Champion des Dames_ and _Les Vigiles de Charles VII_,\r\ncontain miniatures in which the Maid is portrayed according to the\r\nfancy of the illuminator. Such pictures are interesting because they\r\nreveal her as she was imagined by those who lived during her lifetime\r\nor shortly afterwards. It is not their merit that appeals to us; they\r\npossess none; and in no way do they suggest Jean Foucquet.[2775]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2768: _Trial_, vol. i, pp. 100, 292.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2769: There is a wood engraving of this figure in Wallon,\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc_, p. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2770: E. de Bouteiller and G. de Braux, _Notes\r\niconographiques sur Jeanne d'Arc_, Paris and Orleans, 1879, in 18'o\r\nroyal paper.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2771: Reproduced in many works, notably opposite p. 17 in\r\nthe book of E. de Bouteiller and G. de Braux, referred to above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2772: _Ibid._, see woodcut opposite p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2773: In the Orleans Museum.

It represents the Virgin with the Child Jesus, having\r\nSaint Michael on her right and Jeanne d'Arc on her left.[2777] It is\r\nof Italian workmanship and very roughly executed. Jeanne's head, which\r\nhas disappeared beneath the blows of some hard-pointed instrument,\r\nmust have been execrably drawn, if we may judge from the others\r\nremaining on this panel. All four figures are represented with a\r\nscrolled and beaded nimbus, which would have certainly been condemned\r\nby the clerics of Paris and Rouen. And indeed others less strict might\r\naccuse the painter of idolatry when he exalted to the left hand of the\r\nVirgin, to be equal with the Prince of Heavenly Hosts, a mere creature\r\nof the Church Militant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2776: _Trial_, vol. i, p. 100. N. Valois, _Un nouveau\r\ntemoignage sur Jeanne d'Arc_, pp. 8, 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2777: Reproduced in chromo in Wallon's _Jeanne d'Arc_.]\r\n\r\nStanding, her head, neck, and shoulders covered with a kind of furred\r\nhood and tippet fringed with black, her gauntlets and shoes of mail,\r\ngirt above her red tunic with a belt of gold, Jeanne may be recognised\r\nby her name inscribed over her head, and also by the white banner,\r\nembroidered with _fleurs-de-lis_, which she raises in her right hand,\r\nand by her silver shield, embossed in the German style; on the shield\r\nis a sword bearing on its point a crown. A three-lined inscription in\r\nFrench is on the steps of the throne, whereon sits the Virgin Mary.\r\nAlthough the inscription is three parts effaced and almost\r\nunintelligible, with the aid of my learned friend, M. Pierre de\r\nNolhac, Director of the Museum of Versailles, I have succeeded in\r\ndeciphering a few words. These would convey the idea that the\r\ninscription consisted of prayers and wishes for the salvation of\r\nJeanne, who had fallen into the hands of the enemy. It would appear\r\ntherefore that we have here one of those _ex voto_ hung in the\r\nchurches of France during the captivity of the Maid. In such a case\r\nthe nimbus round the head of a living person and the isolated\r\nposition of Jeanne would be easily explained; it is possible that\r\ncertain excellent Frenchmen, thinking no evil, adapted to their own\r\nuse some picture which originally represented the Virgin between two\r\npersonages of the Church Triumphant. By a few touches they transformed\r\none of these personages into the Maid of God. In so small a panel they\r\ncould find no place more suitable to her mortal state, none like those\r\ngenerally occupied at the feet of the Virgin and saints by the\r\nkneeling donors of pictures. This too might explain perhaps why Saint\r\nMichael, the Virgin and the Maid have their names inscribed above\r\nthem. Over the head of the Maid we read _ane darc_. This form _Darc_\r\nmay have been used in 1430.[2778] In the inscription on the steps of\r\nthe throne I discern _Jehane dArc_, with a small _d_ and a capital _A_\r\nfor _dArc_, which is very curious. This causes me to doubt the\r\ngenuineness of the inscription.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2778: The form _Darc_ occurs in the condemnation trial\r\n(_Trial_, vol. i, p. 191, vol. ii, p. 82). But side by side we find\r\nalso _Dars_ (document dated March 31, 1427), _Day_ (patent of\r\nnobility), _Daiz_ (communicated to me by M. Pierre Champion) and\r\n_Daix_ (_Chronique de la Pucelle_).]\r\n\r\nThe _bestion_ tapestry[2779] in the Orleans Museum,[2780] which\r\nrepresents Jeanne's arrival before the King at Chinon, is of German\r\nfifteenth-century workmanship. Coarse of tissue, barbarous in design,\r\nand monotonous in colour, it evinces a certain taste for sumptuous\r\nadornment but also an absolute disregard for literal truth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2779: Tapestry representing small animals.--W.S.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2780: Reproduced in chromo in Wallon's _Jeanne d'Arc_, _cf._\r\nJ. Quicherat, _Histoire du costume en France depuis les temps les plus\r\nrecules, jusqu' la fin du XVIII'e siecle_, Paris, 1875, large\r\noctavo, p. 271.]\r\n\r\nAnother German work was exhibited at Ratisbonne in 1429.
