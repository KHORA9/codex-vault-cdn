Besides that vast\r\naccumulation, I have been favoured with several thousands of other\r\npieces from the legion of Mr. Gladstone's correspondents. Between two\r\nand three hundred thousand written papers of one sort or another must\r\nhave passed under my view. To some important journals and papers from\r\nother sources I have enjoyed free access, and my warm thanks are due to\r\nthose who have generously lent me this valuable aid. I am especially\r\nindebted to the King for the liberality with which his Majesty has been\r\ngraciously pleased to sanction the use of certain documents, in cases\r\nwhere the permission of the Sovereign was required.\r\n\r\nWhen I submitted an application for the same purpose to Queen Victoria,\r\nin readily promising her favourable consideration, the Queen added a\r\nmessage strongly impressing on me that the work I was about to undertake\r\nshould not be handled in the narrow way of party. This injunction\r\nrepresents my own clear view of the spirit in which the history of a\r\ncareer so memorable as Mr. Gladstone's should be composed. That, to be\r\nsure, is not at all inconsistent with our regarding party feeling in its\r\nhonourable sense, as entirely the reverse of an infirmity.\r\n\r\nThe diaries from which I have often quoted consist of forty little books\r\nin double columns, intended to do little more than record persons seen,\r\nor books read, or letters written as the days passed by. From these\r\ndiaries come several of the mottoes prefixed to our chapters; such\r\nmottoes are marked by an asterisk.\r\n\r\nThe trustees and other members of Mr. Gladstone's family have extended\r\nto me a uniform kindness and consideration and an absolutely unstinted\r\nconfidence, for which I can never cease to owe them my heartiest\r\nacknowledgment. They left with the writer an unqualified and undivided\r\nresponsibility for these pages, and for the use of the material that\r\nthey entrusted to him. Whatever may prove to be amiss, whether in\r\nleaving out or putting in or putting wrong, the blame is wholly mine.\r\n\r\n                                                       J.

To try to write his life\r\nto-day, is to push temerity still further. The ashes of controversy, in\r\nwhich he was much concerned, are still hot; perspective, scale,\r\nrelation, must all while we stand so near be difficult to adjust. Not\r\nall particulars, more especially of the latest marches in his wide\r\ncampaign, can be disclosed without risk of unjust pain to persons now\r\nalive. Yet to defer the task for thirty or forty years has plain\r\ndrawbacks too. Interest grows less vivid; truth becomes harder to find\r\nout; memories pale and colour fades. And if in one sense a statesman's\r\ncontemporaries, even after death has abated the storm and temper of\r\nfaction, can scarcely judge him, yet in another sense they who breathe\r\nthe same air as he breathed, who know at close quarters the problems\r\nthat faced him, the materials with which he had to work, the limitations\r\nof his time--such must be the best, if not the only true memorialists\r\nand recorders.\r\n\r\nEvery reader will perceive that perhaps the sharpest of all the many\r\ndifficulties of my task has been to draw the line between history and\r\nbiography--between the fortunes of the community and the exploits,\r\nthoughts, and purposes of the individual who had so marked a share in\r\nthem. In the case of men of letters, in whose lives our literature is\r\nadmirably rich, this difficulty happily for their authors and for our\r\ndelight does not arise. But where the subject is a man who was four\r\ntimes at the head of the government--no phantom, but dictator--and who\r\nheld this office of first minister for a longer time than any other\r\nstatesman in the reign of the Queen, how can we tell the story of his\r\nworks and days without reference, and ample reference, to the course of\r\nevents over whose unrolling he presided, and out of which he made\r\nhistory? It is true that what interests the world in Mr. Gladstone is\r\neven more what he was, than what he did; his brilliancy, charm, and\r\npower; the endless surprises; his dualism or more than dualism; his\r\nvicissitudes of opinion; his subtleties of mental progress; his strange\r\nunion of qualities never elsewhere found together; his striking\r\nunlikeness to other men in whom great and free nations have for long\r\nperiods placed their trust. I am not sure that the incessant search for\r\nclues through this labyrinth would not end in analysis and disquisition,\r\nthat might be no great improvement even upon political history. Mr.\r\nGladstone said of reconstruction of the income-tax that he only did not\r\ncall the task herculean, because Hercules could not have done it.\r\nAssuredly, I am not presumptuous enough to suppose that this difficulty\r\nof fixing the precise scale between history and biography has been\r\nsuccessfully overcome by me. It may be that Hercules himself would have\r\nsucceeded little better.\r\n\r\nSome may think in this connection that I have made the preponderance of\r\npolitics excessive in the story of a genius of signal versatility, to\r\nwhom politics were only one interest among many. No doubt speeches,\r\ndebates, bills, divisions, motions, and manoeuvres of party, like the\r\nmanna that fed the children of Israel in the wilderness, lose their\r\nsavour and power of nutriment on the second day. Yet after all it was to\r\nhis thoughts, his purposes, his ideals, his performances as statesman,\r\nin all the widest significance of that lofty and honourable designation,\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone owes the lasting substance of his fame. His life was\r\never '_greatly absorbed_,' he said, '_in working the institutions of his\r\ncountry_.' Here we mark a signal trait. Not for two centuries, since the\r\nhistoric strife of anglican and puritan, had our island produced a ruler\r\nin whom the religious motive was paramount in the like degree. He was\r\nnot only a political force but a moral force. He strove to use all the\r\npowers of his own genius and the powers of the state for moral purposes\r\nand religious. Nevertheless his mission in all its forms was action. He\r\nhad none of that detachment, often found among superior minds, which we\r\nhonour for its disinterestedness, even while we lament its impotence in\r\nresult. The track in which he moved, the instruments that he employed,\r\nwere the track and the instruments, the sword and the trowel, of\r\npolitical action; and what is called the Gladstonian era was\r\ndistinctively a political era.\r\n\r\nOn this I will permit myself a few words more. The detailed history of\r\nMr. Gladstone as theologian and churchman will not be found in these\r\npages, and nobody is more sensible than their writer of the gap. Mr.\r\nGladstone cared as much for the church as he cared for the state; he\r\nthought of the church as the soul of the state; he believed the\r\nattainment by the magistrate of the ends of government to depend upon\r\nreligion; and he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to\r\nthe religious strength and soundness of the community of which the state\r\nis the civil organ. I should have been wholly wanting in biographical\r\nfidelity, not to make this clear and superabundantly clear. Still a\r\nwriter inside Mr. Gladstone's church and in full and active sympathy\r\nwith him on this side of mundane and supramundane things, would\r\nundoubtedly have treated the subject differently from any writer\r\noutside. No amount of candour or good faith--and in these essentials I\r\nbelieve that I have not fallen short--can be a substitute for the\r\nconfidence and ardour of an adherent, in the heart of those to whom the\r\nchurch stands first. Here is one of the difficulties of this complex\r\ncase. Yet here, too, there may be some trace of compensation. If the\r\nreader has been drawn into the whirlpools of the political Charybdis, he\r\nmight not even in far worthier hands than mine have escaped the rocky\r\nheadlands of the ecclesiastic Scylla. For churches also have their\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury, the distinguished man who followed Mr. Gladstone in a\r\nlonger tenure of power than his, called him 'a great Christian'; and\r\nnothing could be more true or better worth saying. He not only accepted\r\nthe doctrines of that faith as he believed them to be held by his own\r\ncommunion; he sedulously strove to apply the noblest moralities of it\r\nto the affairs both of his own nation and of the commonwealth of\r\nnations. It was a supreme experiment. People will perhaps some day\r\nwonder that many of those who derided the experiment and reproached its\r\nauthor, failed to see that they were making manifest in this a wholesale\r\nscepticism as to truths that they professed to prize, far deeper and\r\nmore destructive than the doubts and disbeliefs of the gentiles in the\r\nouter courts.\r\n\r\nThe epoch, as the reader knows, was what Mr. Gladstone called 'an\r\nagitated and expectant age.' Some stages of his career mark stages of\r\nthe first importance in the history of English party, on which so much\r\nin the working of our constitution hangs. His name is associated with a\r\nrecord of arduous and fruitful legislative work and administrative\r\nimprovement, equalled by none of the great men who have grasped the helm\r\nof the British state. The intensity of his mind, and the length of years\r\nthrough which he held presiding office, enabled him to impress for good\r\nin all the departments of government his own severe standard of public\r\nduty and personal exactitude. He was the chief force, propelling,\r\nrestraining, guiding his country at many decisive moments. Then how many\r\nsurprises and what seeming paradox. Devotedly attached to the church, he\r\nwas the agent in the overthrow of establishment in one of the three\r\nkingdoms, and in an attempt to overthrow it in the Principality.\r\nEntering public life with vehement aversion to the recent dislodgment of\r\nthe landed aristocracy as the mainspring of parliamentary power, he lent\r\nhimself to two further enormously extensive changes in the\r\nconstitutional centre of gravity. With a lifelong belief in\r\nparliamentary deliberation as the grand security for judicious laws and\r\nnational control over executive act, he yet at a certain stage betook\r\nhimself with magical result to direct and individual appeal to the great\r\nmasses of his countrymen, and the world beheld the astonishing spectacle\r\nof a politician with the microscopic subtlety of a thirteenth century\r\nschoolman wielding at will the new democracy in what has been called\r\n'the country of plain men.' A firm and trained economist, and no friend\r\nto socialism, yet by his legislation upon land in 1870 and 1881 he\r\nwrote the opening chapter in a volume on which many an unexpected page\r\nin the history of Property is destined to be inscribed. Statesmen do far\r\nless than they suppose, far less than is implied in their resounding\r\nfame, to augment the material prosperity of nations, but in this\r\nprovince Mr. Gladstone's name stands at the topmost height. Yet no ruler\r\nthat ever lived felt more deeply the truth--for which I know no better\r\nwords than Channing's--that to improve man's outward condition is not to\r\nimprove man himself; this must come from each man's endeavour within his\r\nown breast; without that there can be little ground for social hope.\r\nWell was it said to him, 'You have so lived and wrought that you have\r\nkept the soul alive in England.' Not in England only was this felt. He\r\nwas sometimes charged with lowering the sentiment, the lofty and\r\nfortifying sentiment, of national pride. At least it is a ground for\r\nnational pride that he, the son of English training, practised through\r\nlong years in the habit and tradition of English public life, standing\r\nfor long years foremost in accepted authority and renown before the eye\r\nof England, so conquered imagination and attachment in other lands, that\r\nwhen the end came it was thought no extravagance for one not an\r\nEnglishman to say, 'On the day that Mr. Gladstone died, the world has\r\nlost its greatest citizen.' The reader who revolves all this will know\r\nwhy I began by speaking of temerity.\r\n\r\nThat my book should be a biography without trace of bias, no reader will\r\nexpect. There is at least no bias against the truth; but indifferent\r\nneutrality in a work produced, as this is, in the spirit of loyal and\r\naffectionate remembrance, would be distasteful, discordant, and\r\nimpossible. I should be heartily sorry if there were no signs of\r\npartiality and no evidence of prepossession. On the other hand there is,\r\nI trust, no importunate advocacy or tedious assentation. He was great\r\nman enough to stand in need of neither. Still less has it been needed,\r\nin order to exalt him, to disparage others with whom he came into strong\r\ncollision. His own funeral orations from time to time on some who were\r\nin one degree or another his antagonists, prove that this petty and\r\nungenerous method would have been to him of all men most repugnant. Then\r\nto pretend that for sixty years, with all 'the varying weather of the\r\nmind,' he traversed in every zone the restless ocean of a great nation's\r\nshifting and complex politics, without many a faulty tack and many a\r\nwrong reckoning, would indeed be idle. No such claim is set up by\r\nrational men for Pym, Cromwell, Walpole, Washington, or either Pitt. It\r\nis not set up for any of the three contemporaries of Mr. Gladstone whose\r\nnames live with the three most momentous transactions of his\r\nage--Cavour, Lincoln, Bismarck. To suppose, again, that in every one of\r\nthe many subjects touched by him, besides exhibiting the range of his\r\npowers and the diversity of his interests, he made abiding contributions\r\nto thought and knowledge, is to ignore the jealous conditions under\r\nwhich such contributions come. To say so much as this is to make but a\r\nsmall deduction from the total of a grand account.\r\n\r\nI have not reproduced the full text of Letters in the proportion\r\ncustomary in English biography. The existing mass of his letters is\r\nenormous. But then an enormous proportion of them touch on affairs of\r\npublic business, on which they shed little new light. Even when he\r\nwrites in his kindest and most cordial vein to friends to whom he is\r\nmost warmly attached, it is usually a letter of business. He deals\r\nfreely and genially with the points in hand, and then without play of\r\ngossip, salutation, or compliment, he passes on his way. He has in his\r\nletters little of that spirit in which his talk often abounded, of\r\ndisengagement, pleasant colloquy, happy raillery, and all the other\r\nundefined things that make the correspondence of so many men whose\r\nbusiness was literature, such delightful reading for the idler hour of\r\nan industrious day. It is perhaps worth adding that the asterisks\r\ndenoting an omitted passage hide no piquant hit, no personality, no\r\nindiscretion; the omission is in every case due to consideration of\r\nspace. Without these asterisks and, other omissions, nothing would have\r\nbeen easier than to expand these three volumes into a hundred. I think\r\nnothing relevant is lost. Nobody ever had fewer secrets, nobody ever\r\nlived and wrought in fuller sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                              CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n                            (_1809-1821_)\r\n\r\n     I know not why commerce in England should not have its old\r\n     families, rejoicing to be connected with commerce from generation\r\n     to generation. It has been so in other countries; I trust it will\r\n     be so in this country.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the life of the great and famous man who is our subject in\r\nthese memoirs has been depicted with homely simplicity by his own hand.\r\nWith this fragment of a record it is perhaps best for me to begin our\r\njourney. 'I was born,' he says, 'on December 29, 1809,' at 62 Rodney\r\nStreet, Liverpool. 'I was baptized, I believe, in the parish church of\r\nSt. Peter. My godmother was my elder sister Anne, then just seven years\r\nold, who died a perfect saint in the beginning of the year 1829. In her\r\nlater years she lived in close relations with me, and I must have been\r\nmuch worse but for her. Of my godfathers, one was a Scotch episcopalian,\r\nMr. Fraser of ----, whom I hardly ever saw or heard of; the other a\r\npresbyterian, Mr. G. Grant, a junior partner of my father's.' The child\r\nwas named William Ewart, after his father's friend, an immigrant Scot\r\nand a merchant like himself, and father of a younger William Ewart, who\r\nbecame member for Liverpool, and did good public service in parliament.\r\n\r\n     Before proceeding to the period of my childhood, properly\r\n     so-called, I will here insert a few words about my family. My\r\n     maternal grandfather was known as Provost Robertson of Dingwall, a\r\n     man held, I believe, in the highest respect. His wife was a\r\n     Mackenzie of [Coul]. His circumstances must have been good.\r\n\r\n     Of his three sons, one went into the army, and I recollect him as\r\n     Captain Robertson (I have a seal which he gave me, a three-sided\r\n     cairngorm. Cost him 71/2 guineas). The other two took mercantile\r\n     positions. When my parents made a Scotch tour in 1820-21 with, I\r\n     think, their four sons, the freedom of Dingwall was presented to us\r\n     all,[1] with my father; and there was large visiting at the houses\r\n     of the Ross-shire gentry. I think the line of my grandmother was\r\n     stoutly episcopalian and Jacobite; but, coming outside the western\r\n     highlands, the first at least was soon rubbed down. The provost, I\r\n     think, came from a younger branch of the Robertsons of Struan.\r\n\r\n     On my father's side the matter is more complex. The history of the\r\n     family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my\r\n     own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has\r\n     carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth,\r\n     but has not yet been able to connect us with the earliest known\r\n     holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes\r\n     to do. Some things are plain and not without interest. They were a\r\n     race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone\r\n     castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century.\r\n     The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the\r\n     crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service\r\n     like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case\r\n     passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in\r\n     Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of\r\n     family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined\r\n     by public authority, but not for any ordinary criminal offence.\r\n     From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During\r\n     the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a\r\n     line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire.\r\n     Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar.\r\n     I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of\r\n     that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small\r\n     watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my\r\n     father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the\r\n     family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem\r\n     to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in\r\n     Yorkshire.[3]\r\n\r\n                                  ANCESTRY\r\n\r\n     My father's father seems from his letters to have been an excellent\r\n     man and a wise parent: his wife a woman of energy. There are\r\n     pictures of them at Fasque, by Raeburn. He was a merchant, in\r\n     Scotch phrase; that is to say, a shopkeeper dealing in corn and\r\n     stores, and my father as a lad served in his shop. But he also sent\r\n     a ship or ships to the Baltic; and I believe that my father, whose\r\n     energy soon began to outtop that of all the very large family, went\r\n     in one of these ships at a very early age as a supercargo, an\r\n     appointment then, I think, common. But he soon quitted a nest too\r\n     small to hold him. He was born in December 1764: and I have (at\r\n     Hawarden) a reprint of the _Liverpool Directory_ for 178-, in which\r\n     his name appears as a partner in the firm of Messrs. Corrie, corn\r\n     merchants.\r\n\r\n     Here his force soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a\r\n     foremost member of the community. A liberal in the early period of\r\n     the century, he drew to Mr. Canning, and brought that statesman as\r\n     candidate to Liverpool in 1812, by personally offering to guarantee\r\n     his expenses at a time when, though prosperous, he could hardly\r\n     have been a rich man. His services to the town were testified by\r\n     gifts of plate, now in the possession of the elder lines of his\r\n     descendants, and by a remarkable subscription of six thousand\r\n     pounds raised to enable him to contest the borough of Lancaster,\r\n     for which he sat in the parliament of 1818.\r\n\r\n     At his demise, in December 1851, the value of his estate was, I\r\n     think, near L600,000. My father was a successful merchant, but\r\n     considering his long life and means of accumulation, the result\r\n     represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others\r\n     whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed. It was a large\r\n     and strong nature, simple though hasty, profoundly affectionate and\r\n     capable of the highest devotion in the lines of duty and of love. I\r\n     think that his intellect was a little intemperate, though not his\r\n     character. In his old age, spent mainly in retirement, he was our\r\n     constant [centre of] social and domestic life. My mother, a\r\n     beautiful and admirable woman, failed in health and left him a\r\n     widower in 1835, when she was 62.\r\n\r\nHe then turns to the records of his own childhood, a period that he\r\nregarded as closing in September 1821, when he was sent to Eton. He\r\nbegins with one or two juvenile performances, in no way differing from\r\nthose of any other infant,--_navita projectus humi_, the mariner flung\r\nby force of the waves naked and helpless ashore. He believes that he was\r\nstrong and healthy, and came well through his childish ailments.\r\n\r\n     My next recollection belongs to the period of Mr. Canning's first\r\n     election for Liverpool, in the month of October of the year 1812.\r\n     Much entertaining went on in my father's house, where Mr. Canning\r\n     himself was a guest; and on a day of a great dinner I was taken\r\n     down to the dining room. I was set upon one of the chairs,\r\n     standing, and directed to say to the company 'Ladies and\r\n     gentlemen.'\r\n\r\n     I have, thirdly, a group of recollections which refer to Scotland.\r\n     Thither my father and mother took me on a journey which they made,\r\n     I think, in a post-chaise to Edinburgh and Glasgow as its principal\r\n     points. At Edinburgh our sojourn was in the Royal Hotel, Princes\r\n     Street. I well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle\r\n     guns were fired on some great occasion, probably the abdication of\r\n     Napoleon, for the date of the journey was, I think, the spring of\r\n     1814.\r\n\r\n                            EARLY RECOLLECTIONS\r\n\r\n     In this journey the situation of Sanquhar, in a close Dumfriesshire\r\n     valley, impressed itself on my recollection. I never saw Sanquhar\r\n     again until in the autumn of 1863 (as I believe). As I was whirled\r\n     along the Glasgow and South-Western railway I witnessed just\r\n     beneath me lines of building in just such a valley, and said that\r\n     must be Sanquhar, which it was. My local memory has always been\r\n     good and very impressible by scenery. I seem to myself never to\r\n     have forgotten a scene.\r\n\r\n     I have one other early recollection to record. It must, I think,\r\n     have been in the year 1815 that my father and mother took me with\r\n     them on either one or two more journeys. The objective points were\r\n     Cambridge and London respectively. My father had built, under the\r\n     very niggard and discouraging laws which repressed rather than\r\n     encouraged the erection of new churches at that period, the church\r\n     of St. Thomas at Seaforth, and he wanted a clergyman for it.[4]\r\n     Guided in these matters very much by the deeply religious temper of\r\n     my mother, he went with her to Cambridge to obtain a recommendation\r\n     of a suitable person from Mr. Simeon, whom I saw at the time.[5] I\r\n     remember his appearance distinctly. He was a venerable man, and\r\n     although only a fellow of a college, was more ecclesiastically got\r\n     up than many a dean, or even here and there, perhaps, a bishop of\r\n     the present less costumed if more ritualistic period. Mr. Simeon, I\r\n     believe, recommended Mr. Jones, an excellent specimen of the\r\n     excellent evangelical school of those days. We went to Leicester to\r\n     hear him preach in a large church, and his text was '_Grow in\r\n     grace_.' He became eventually archdeacon of Liverpool, and died in\r\n     great honour a few years ago at much past 90. On the strength of\r\n     this visit to Cambridge I lately boasted there, even during the\r\n     lifetime of the aged Provost Okes, that I had been in the\r\n     university before any one of them.\r\n\r\n     I think it was at this time that in London we were domiciled in\r\n     Russell Square, in the house of a brother of my mother, Mr. Colin\r\n     Robertson; and I was vexed and put about by being forbidden to run\r\n     freely at my own will into and about the streets, as I had done in\r\n     Liverpool. But the main event was this: we went to a great service\r\n     of public thanksgiving at Saint Paul's, and sat in a small gallery\r\n     annexed to the choir, just over the place where was the Regent, and\r\n     looking down upon him from behind. I recollect nothing more of the\r\n     service, nor was I ever present at any public thanksgiving after\r\n     this in Saint Paul's, until the service held in that cathedral,\r\n     under my advice as the prime minister, after the highly dangerous\r\n     illness of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n     Before quitting the subject of early recollections I must name one\r\n     which involves another person of some note. My mother took me in\r\n     181--to Barley Wood Cottage, near Bristol. Here lived Miss Hannah\r\n     More, with some of her coeval sisters. I am sure they loved my\r\n     mother, who was love-worthy indeed. And I cannot help here\r\n     deviating for a moment into the later portion of the story to\r\n     record that in 1833 I had the honour of breakfasting with Mr.\r\n     Wilberforce a few days before his death,[6] and when I entered the\r\n     house, immediately after the salutation, he said to me in his\r\n     silvery tones, 'How is your sweet mother?' He had been a guest in\r\n     my father's house some twelve years before. During the afternoon\r\n     visit at Barley Wood, Miss Hannah More took me aside and presented\r\n     to me a little book. It was a copy of her _Sacred Dramas_, and it\r\n     now remains in my possession, with my name written in it by her.\r\n     She very graciously accompanied it with a little speech, of which I\r\n     cannot recollect the conclusion (or apodosis), but it began, 'As\r\n     you have just come into the world, and I am just going out of it, I\r\n     therefore,' etc.\r\n\r\n    I wish that in reviewing my childhood I could regard it as\r\n    presenting those features of innocence and beauty which I have often\r\n    seen elsewhere, and indeed, thanks be to God, within the limits of\r\n    my own home. The best I can say for it is that I do not think it was\r\n    a vicious childhood. I do not think, trying to look at the past\r\n    impartially, that I had a strong natural propensity then developed\r\n    to what are termed the mortal sins. But truth obliges me to record\r\n    this against myself. I have no recollection of being a loving or a\r\n    winning child; or an earnest or diligent or knowledge-loving child.\r\n    God forgive me. And what pains and shames me most of all is to\r\n    remember that at most and at best I was, like the sailor in Juvenal,\r\n\r\n                            digitis a morte remotus,\r\n                     Quatuor aut septem;[7]\r\n\r\n    the plank between me and all the sins was so very thin. I do not\r\n    indeed intend in these notes to give a history of the inner life,\r\n    which I think has been with me extraordinarily dubious, vacillating,\r\n    and above all complex. I reserve them, perhaps, for a more private\r\n    and personal document; and I may in this way relieve myself from\r\n    some at least of the risks of falling into an odious Pharisaism. I\r\n    cannot in truth have been an interesting child, and the only\r\n    presumption the other way which I can gather from my review is that\r\n    there was probably something in me worth the seeing, or my father\r\n    and mother would not so much have singled me out to be taken with\r\n    them on their journeys.\r\n\r\n    I was not a devotional child. I have no recollection of early love\r\n    for the House of God and for divine service: though after my father\r\n    built the church at Seaforth in 1815, I remember cherishing a hope\r\n    that he would bequeath it to me, and that I might live in it. I have\r\n    a very early recollection of hearing preaching in St. George's,\r\n    Liverpool, but it is this: that I turned quickly to my mother and\r\n    said, 'When will he have done?' The _Pilgrim's Progress_ undoubtedly\r\n    took a great and fascinating hold upon me, so that anything which I\r\n    wrote was insensibly moulded in its style; but it was by the force\r\n    of the allegory addressing itself to the fancy, and was very like a\r\n    strong impression received from the _Arabian Nights_, and from\r\n    another work called _Tales of the Genii_. I think it was about the\r\n    same time that Miss Porter's _Scottish Chiefs_, and especially the\r\n    life and death of Wallace, used to make me weep profusely. This\r\n    would be when I was about ten years old. At a much earlier period,\r\n    say six or seven, I remember praying earnestly, but it was for no\r\n    higher object than to be spared from the loss of a tooth. Here,\r\n    however, it may be mentioned in mitigation that the local dentist\r\n    of those days, in our case a certain Dr. P. of ---- Street,\r\n    Liverpool, was a kind of savage at his work (possibly a very\r\n    good-natured man too), with no ideas except to smash and crash. My\r\n    religious recollections, then, are a sad blank. Neither was I a\r\n    popular boy, though not egregiously otherwise. If I was not a bad\r\n    boy, I think that I was a boy with a great absence of goodness. I\r\n    was a child of slow, in some points I think of singularly slow,\r\n    development. There was more in me perhaps than in the average boy,\r\n    but it required greatly more time to set itself in order: and just\r\n    so in adult, and in middle and later life, I acquired very tardily\r\n    any knowledge of the world, and that simultaneous conspectus of the\r\n    relations of persons and things which is necessary for the proper\r\n    performance of duties in the world.\r\n\r\n    I may mention another matter in extenuation. I received, unless my\r\n    memory deceives me, very little benefit from teaching. My father was\r\n    too much occupied, my mother's health was broken. We, the four\r\n    brothers, had no quarrelling among ourselves: but neither can I\r\n    recollect any influence flowing down at this time upon me, the\r\n    junior. One odd incident seems to show that I was meek, which I\r\n    should not have supposed, not less than thrifty and penurious, a\r\n    leaning which lay deep, I think, in my nature, and which has\r\n    required effort and battle to control it. It was this. By some\r\n    process not easy to explain I had, when I was _probably_ seven or\r\n    eight, and my elder brothers from ten or eleven to fourteen or\r\n    thereabouts, accumulated no less than twenty shillings in silver. My\r\n    brothers judged it right to appropriate this fund, and I do not\r\n    recollect either annoyance or resistance or complaint. But I\r\n    recollect that they employed the principal part of it in the\r\n    purchase of four knives, and that they broke the points from the\r\n    tops of the blades of my knife, lest I should cut my fingers.\r\n\r\n    Where was the official or appointed teacher all this time? He was\r\n    the Rev. Mr. Rawson of Cambridge, who had, I suppose, been passed by\r\n    Mr. Simeon and become private tutor in my father's house. But as he\r\n    was to be incumbent of the church, the bishop required a parsonage\r\n    and that he should live in it. Out of this grew a very small school\r\n    of about twelve boys, to which I went, with some senior brother or\r\n    brothers remaining for a while.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rawson was a good man, of high no-popery opinions. His school\r\n     afterwards rose into considerable repute, and it had Dean Stanley\r\n     and the sons of one or more other Cheshire families for pupils. But\r\n     I think this was not so much due to its intellectual stamina as to\r\n     the extreme salubrity of the situation on the pure dry sands of the\r\n     Mersey's mouth, with all the advantages of the strong tidal action\r\n     and the fresh and frequent north-west winds. At five miles from\r\n     Liverpool Exchange, the sands, delicious for riding, were one\r\n     absolute solitude, and only one house looked down on them between\r\n     us and the town. To return to Mr. Rawson. Everything was\r\n     unobjectionable. I suppose I learnt something there. But I have no\r\n     recollection of being under any moral or personal influence\r\n     whatever, and I doubt whether the preaching had any adaptation\r\n     whatever to children. As to intellectual training, I believe that,\r\n     like the other boys, I shirked my work as much as I could. I went\r\n     to Eton in 1821 after a pretty long spell, in a very middling state\r\n     of preparation, and wholly without any knowledge or other\r\n     enthusiasm, unless it were a priggish love of argument which I had\r\n     begun to develop. I had lived upon a rabbit warren: and what a\r\n     rabbit warren of a life it is that I have been surveying.\r\n\r\n     My brother John, three years older than myself, and of a moral\r\n     character more manly and on a higher level, had chosen the navy,\r\n     and went off to the preparatory college at Portsmouth. But he\r\n     evidently underwent persecution for righteousness' sake at the\r\n     college, which was then (say about 1820) in a bad condition. Of\r\n     this, though he was never querulous, his letters bore the traces,\r\n     and I cannot but think they must have exercised upon me some kind\r\n     of influence for good. As to miscellaneous notices, I had a great\r\n     affinity with the trades of joiners and of bricklayers. Physically\r\n     I must have been rather tough, for my brother John took me down at\r\n     about ten years old to wrestle in the stables with an older lad of\r\n     that region, whom I threw. Among our greatest enjoyments were\r\n     undoubtedly the annual Guy Fawkes bonfires, for which we had always\r\n     liberal allowances of wreck timber and a tar-barrel. I remember\r\n     seeing, when about eight or nine, my first case of a dead body. It\r\n     was the child of the head gardener Derbyshire, and was laid in the\r\n     cottage bed by tender hands, with nice and clean accompaniments.\r\n     It seemed to me pleasing, and in no way repelled me; but it made no\r\n     deep impression. And now I remember that I used to teach pretty\r\n     regularly on Sundays in the Sunday-school built by my father near\r\n     the Primrose bridge. It was, I think, a duty done not under\r\n     constraint, but I can recollect nothing which associates it with a\r\n     seriously religious life in myself.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      II\r\n\r\n                                  GENEALOGY\r\n\r\nTo these fragments no long supplement is needed. Little of interest can\r\nbe certainly established about his far-off ancestral origins, and the\r\nordinary twilight of genealogy overhangs the case of the Glaidstanes,\r\nGledstanes, Gladstanes, Gladstones, whose name is to be found on\r\ntombstones and parish rolls, in charter-chests and royal certificates,\r\non the southern border of Scotland. The explorations of the genealogist\r\ntell of recognitions of their nobility by Scottish kings in dim ages,\r\nbut the links are sometimes broken, title-deeds are lost, the same name\r\nis attached to estates in different counties, Roxburgh, Peebles, Lanark,\r\nand in short until the close of the seventeenth century we linger, in\r\nthe old poet's phrase, among dreams of shadows. As we have just been\r\ntold, during the eighteenth century no traces of their gentility\r\nsurvives, and apparently they glided down from moderate lairds to small\r\nmaltsters. Thomas Gladstones, grandfather of him with whom we are\r\nconcerned, made his way from Biggar to Leith, and there set up in a\r\nmodest way as corndealer, wholesale and retail. His wife was a Neilson\r\nof Springfield. To them sixteen children were born, and John Gladstones\r\n(b. Dec. 11, 1764) was their eldest son. Having established himself in\r\nLiverpool, he married in 1792 Jane Hall, a lady of that city, who died\r\nwithout children six years later. In 1800 he took for his second wife\r\nAnne Robertson of Dingwall. Her father was of the clan Donnachaidh, and\r\nher mother was of kin with Mackenzies, Munros, and other highland\r\nstocks.[9] Their son, therefore, was of unmixed Scottish origins, half\r\nhighland, half lowland borderer.[10] With the possible exception of Lord\r\nMansfield--the rival of Chatham in parliament, one of the loftiest names\r\namong great judges, and chief builder of the commercial law of the\r\nEnglish world, a man who might have been prime minister if he had\r\nchosen.--Mr. Gladstone stands out as far the most conspicuous and\r\npowerful of all the public leaders in our history, who have sprung from\r\nthe northern half of our island. When he had grown to be the most famous\r\nman in the realm of the Queen, he said, 'I am not slow to claim the\r\nname of Scotsman, and even if I were, there is the fact staring me in\r\nthe face that not a drop of blood runs in my veins except what is\r\nderived from a Scottish ancestry.'[11] An illustrious opponent once\r\ndescribed him, by way of hitting his singular duality of disposition, as\r\nan ardent Italian in the custody of a Scotsman. It is easy to make too\r\nmuch of race, but when we are puzzled by Mr. Gladstone's seeming\r\ncontrarieties of temperament, his union of impulse with caution, of\r\npassion with circumspection, of pride and fire with self-control, of\r\nOssianic flight with a steady foothold on the solid earth, we may\r\nperhaps find a sort of explanation in thinking of him as a highlander in\r\nthe custody of a lowlander.\r\n\r\nOf John Gladstone something more remains to be said. About 1783 he was\r\nmade a partner by his father in the business at Leith, and here he saved\r\nfive hundred pounds. Four years later, probably after a short period of\r\nservice, he was admitted to a partnership with two corn-merchants at\r\nLiverpool, his contribution to the total capital of four thousand pounds\r\nbeing fifteen hundred, of which his father lent him five hundred, and a\r\nfriend another five at five per cent. In 1787 he thought the plural\r\nending of his name sounded awkwardly in the style of the firm, Corrie,\r\nGladstones, and Bradshaw, so he dropped the _s_.[12] He visited London\r\nto enlarge his knowledge of the corn trade in Mark Lane, and here became\r\nacquainted with Sir Claude Scott, the banker (not yet, however, a\r\nbaronet). Scott was so impressed by his extraordinary vigour and\r\nshrewdness as to talk of a partnership, but Gladstone's existing\r\narrangement in Liverpool was settled for fourteen years. Sometime in the\r\nnineties he was sent to America to purchase corn, with unlimited\r\nconfidence from Sir Claude Scott. On his arrival, he found a severe\r\nscarcity and enormous prices. A large number of vessels had been\r\nchartered for the enterprise, and were on their way to him for cargoes.\r\nTo send them back in ballast would be a disaster. Thrown entirely on his\r\nown resources, he travelled south from New York, making the best\r\npurchases of all sorts that he could; then loaded his ships with timber\r\nand other commodities, one only of them with flour; and the loss on the\r\nventure, which might have meant ruin, did not exceed a few hundred\r\npounds. Energy and resource of this kind made fortune secure, and when\r\nthe fourteen years of partnership expired, Gladstone continued business\r\non his own account, with a prosperity that was never broken. He brought\r\nhis brothers to Liverpool, but it was to provide for them, not to assist\r\nhimself, says Mr. Gladstone; 'and he provided for many young men in the\r\nsame way. I never knew him reject any kind of work in aid of others that\r\noffered itself to him.'\r\n\r\n                             JOHN GLADSTONE\r\n\r\nIt was John Gladstone's habit, we are told, to discuss all sorts of\r\nquestions with his children, and nothing was ever taken for granted\r\nbetween him and his sons. 'He could not understand,' says the\r\nillustrious one among them, 'nor tolerate those who, perceiving an\r\nobject to be good, did not at once and actively pursue it; and with all\r\nthis energy he joined a corresponding warmth and, so to speak, eagerness\r\nof affection, a keen appreciation of humour, in which he found a rest,\r\nand an indescribable frankness and simplicity of character, which,\r\ncrowning his other qualities, made him, I think (and I strive to think\r\nimpartially), the most interesting old man I have ever known.'[13]\r\n\r\nTo his father's person and memory, Mr. Gladstone's fervid and\r\naffectionate devotion remained unbroken. 'One morning,' writes a female\r\nrelative of his, 'when I was breakfasting alone with Mr. Gladstone at\r\nCarlton House Terrace something led to his speaking of his father. I\r\nseem to see him now, rising from his chair, standing in front of the\r\nchimneypiece, and in strains of fervid eloquence dwelling on the\r\ngrandeur, the breadth and depth of his character, his generosity, his\r\nnobleness, last and greatest of all--his loving nature. His eyes filled\r\nwith tears as he exclaimed: \"None but his children can know what\r\ntorrents of tenderness flowed from his heart.\"'\r\n\r\nThe successful merchant was also the active-minded citizen. 'His\r\nforce,' says his son, 'soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a\r\nforemost member of the community.' He had something of his descendant's\r\ninextinguishable passion for pamphleteering, and the copious effusion of\r\npublic letters and articles. As was inevitable in a Scotsman of his\r\nsocial position at that day, when tory rule of a more tyrannic stamp\r\nthan was ever known in England since the Revolution of 1688, had reduced\r\nconstitutional liberty in Scotland to a shadow, John Gladstone came to\r\nLiverpool a whig, and a whig he remained until Canning raised the flag\r\nof a new party inside the entrenchments of Eldonian toryism.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 Canning, who had just refused Lord Liverpool's proffer of the\r\nforeign office because he would not serve under Castlereagh as leader in\r\nthe House of Commons, was invited by John Gladstone to stand for\r\nLiverpool. He was elected in triumph over Brougham, and held the seat\r\nthrough four elections, down to 1822, when he was succeeded by\r\nHuskisson, whom he described to the constituency as the best man of\r\nbusiness in England, and one of the ablest practical statesmen that\r\ncould engage in the concerns of a commercial country. The speeches made\r\nto his constituents during the ten years for which he served them are\r\nexcellent specimens of Canning's rich, gay, aspiring eloquence. In\r\nsubstance they abound in much pure toryism, and his speech after the\r\nPeterloo massacre, and upon the topics relating to public meetings,\r\nsedition, and parliamentary reform, though by sonorous splendour and a\r\nsuperb plausibility fascinating to the political neophyte, is by no\r\nmeans free from froth, without much relation either to social facts or\r\nto popular principles. On catholic emancipation he followed Pitt, as he\r\ndid in an enlarged view of commercial policy. At Liverpool he made his\r\nfamous declaration that his political allegiance was buried in Pitt's\r\ngrave. At one at least of these performances the youthful William\r\nGladstone was present, but it was at home that he learned Canningite\r\ndoctrine. At Seaforth House Canning spent the days between the death of\r\nCastlereagh and his own recall to power, while he was waiting for the\r\ndate fixed for his voyage to take up the viceroyalty of India.\r\n\r\n                              CANNING\r\n\r\nAs from whig John Gladstone turned Canningite, so from presbyterian\r\nalso he turned churchman. He paid the penalty of men who change their\r\nparty, and was watched with a critical eye by old friends; but he was a\r\nliberal giver for beneficent public purposes, and in 1811 he was\r\nhonoured by the freedom of Liverpool. His ambition naturally pointed to\r\nparliament, and he was elected first for Lancaster in 1818, and next for\r\nWoodstock in 1820, two boroughs of extremely easy political virtue.\r\nLancaster cost him twelve thousand pounds, towards which his friends in\r\nLiverpool contributed one-half. In 1826 he was chosen at Berwick, but\r\nwas unseated the year after. His few performances in the House were not\r\nremarkable. He voted with ministers, and on the open question of\r\ncatholic emancipation he went with Canning and Plunket. He was one of\r\nthe majority who by six carried Plunket's catholic motion in 1821, and\r\nthe matter figures in the earliest of the hundreds of surviving letters\r\nfrom his youngest son, then over eleven, and on the eve of his departure\r\nfor Eton:--\r\n\r\n     _Seaforth, Mar._ 10, 1821.\r\n\r\n     I address these few lines to you to know how my dear mother is, to\r\n     thank you for your kind letter, and to know whether Edward may get\r\n     two padlocks for the wicket and large shore gate. They are now\r\n     open, and the people make a thoroughfare of the green walk and the\r\n     carriage road. I read Mr. Plunket's speech, and I admire it\r\n     exceedingly. I enclose a letter from Mr. Rawson to you. He told me\r\n     to-day that Mrs. R. was a great deal better. Write to me again as\r\n     soon as you can.--Ever your most affectionate and dutiful son, W.\r\n     E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\nIn after years he was fond of recalling how the Liverpool with which he\r\nhad been most familiar (1810-20), though the second commercial town in\r\nthe kingdom, did not exceed 100,000 of population, and how the silver\r\ncloud of smoke that floated above her resembled that which might now\r\nappear over any secondary borough or village of the country. 'I have\r\nseen wild roses growing upon the very ground that is now the centre of\r\nthe borough of Bootle. All that land is now partly covered with\r\nresidences and partly with places of business and industry; but in my\r\ntime but one single house stood upon the space between Primrose brook\r\nand the town of Liverpool.' Among his early recollections was 'the\r\nextraordinarily beautiful spectacle of a dock delivery on the Mersey\r\nafter a long prevalence of westerly winds followed by a change.\r\nLiverpool cannot imitate that now [1892], at least not for the eye.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n                   JOHN GLADSTONE AS SLAVEHOLDER\r\n\r\nThe Gladstone firm was mainly an East India house, but in the last ten\r\nyears of his mercantile course John Gladstone became the owner of\r\nextensive plantations of sugar and coffee in the West Indies, some in\r\nJamaica, others in British Guiana or Demerara. The infamy of the\r\nslave-trade had been abolished in 1807, but slave labour remained, and\r\nthe Liverpool merchant, like a host of other men of equal respectability\r\nand higher dignity, including many peers and even some bishops, was a\r\nslaveholder. Everybody who has ever read one of the most honourable and\r\nglorious chapters in our English history knows the case of the\r\nmissionary John Smith.[14] In 1823 an outbreak of the slaves occurred in\r\nDemerara, and one of John Gladstone's plantations happened to be its\r\ncentre. The rising was stamped out with great cruelty in three days.\r\nMartial law, the savage instrument of race passion, was kept in force\r\nfor over five months. Fifty negroes were hanged, many were shot down in\r\nthe thickets, others were torn in pieces by the lash of the cart-whip.\r\nSmith was arrested, although he had in fact done his best to stop the\r\nrising. Tried before a court in which every rule of evidence was\r\ntyrannically set aside, he was convicted on hearsay and condemned to\r\ndeath. Before the atrocious sentence could be commuted by the home\r\nauthorities, the fiery heat and noisome vapours of his prison killed\r\nhim. The death of the Demerara missionary, it has been truly said, was\r\nan event as fatal to slavery in the West Indies, as the execution of\r\nJohn Brown was its deathblow in the United States.[15] Brougham in 1824\r\nbrought the case before the House of Commons, and in the various\r\ndiscussions upon it the Gladstone estates made rather a prominent\r\nfigure. John Gladstone became involved in a heated and prolonged\r\ncontroversy as to the management of his plantations; as we shall see, it\r\ndid not finally die down till 1841. He was an indomitable man. In a\r\nnewspaper discussion through a long series of letters, he did not defend\r\nslavery in the abstract, but protested against the abuse levelled at the\r\nplanters by all 'the intemperate, credulous, designing, or interested\r\nindividuals who followed the lead of that well-meaning but mistaken man,\r\nMr. Wilberforce.' He denounced the missionaries as hired emissaries,\r\nwhose object seemed to be rather to revolutionise the colonies than to\r\ndiffuse religion among the people.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he published a pamphlet, in the form of a letter to Sir Robert\r\nPeel,[16] to explain that negroes were happier when forced to work;\r\nthat, as their labour was essential to the welfare of the colonies, he\r\nconsidered the difficulties in the way of emancipation insurmountable;\r\nthat it was not for him to seek to destroy a system that an over-ruling\r\nProvidence had seen fit to permit in certain climates since the very\r\nformation of society; and finally with a Parthian bolt, he hinted that\r\nthe public would do better to look to the condition of the lower classes\r\nat home than to the negroes in the colonies. The pamphlet made its mark,\r\nand was admitted by the abolitionists to be an attempt of unusual\r\ningenuity to varnish the most heinous of national crimes. Three years\r\nlater, when emancipation came, and the twenty million pounds of\r\ncompensation were distributed, John Gladstone appears to have received,\r\nindividually and apart from his partnerships, a little over seventy-five\r\nthousand pounds for 1609 slaves.[17]\r\n\r\nIt is as well, though in anticipation of the order of time, to complete\r\nour sketch. In view of the approach of full abolition, John Gladstone\r\ninduced Lord Glenelg, the whig secretary of state, to issue an order in\r\ncouncil (1837) permitting the West Indian planters to ship coolies from\r\nIndia on terms drawn up by the planters themselves. Objections were made\r\nwith no effect by the governor at Demerara, a humane and vigorous man,\r\nwho had done much work as military engineer under Wellington, and who,\r\nafter abolishing the flogging of female slaves in the Bahamas, now set\r\nsuch an iron yoke upon the planters and their agents in Demerara, that\r\nhe said 'he could sleep satisfied that no person in the colony could be\r\npunished without his knowledge and sanction.'[18] The importation of\r\ncoolies raised old questions in new forms. The voyage from India was\r\ndeclared to reproduce the horrors of the middle passage of the vanished\r\nGuinea slavers; the condition of the coolie on the sugar plantations was\r\ndrawn in a light only less lurid than the case of the African negro; and\r\nJohn Gladstone was again in hot water. Thomas Gladstone, his eldest son,\r\ndefended him in parliament (Aug. 3, 1839), and commissioners sent to\r\ninquire into the condition of the various Gladstone plantations reported\r\nthat the coolies on Vreedestein appeared contented and happy on the\r\nwhole; no one had ever maltreated or beaten them except in one case; and\r\nthose on Vreedenhoop appeared perfectly contented. The interpreter, who\r\nhad abused them, had been fined, punished, and dismissed. Upon the\r\nmotion of W. E. Gladstone, these reports were laid upon the table of the\r\nHouse in 1840.[19]\r\n\r\nWe shall have not unimportant glimpses, as our story unfolds itself, of\r\nall these transactions. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the\r\nstatesman whose great ensign was to be human freedom, was thus born in a\r\nfamily where the palliation of slavery must have made a daily topic. The\r\nunion, moreover, of fervid evangelical religion with antagonism to\r\nabolition must in those days have been rare, and in spite of his devoted\r\nfaith in his father the youthful Gladstone may well have had uneasy\r\nmoments. If so, he perhaps consoled himself with the authority of\r\nCanning. Canning, in 1823, had formally laid down the neutral principles\r\ncommon to the statesmen of the day: that amelioration of the lot of the\r\nnegro slave was the utmost limit of action, and that his freedom as a\r\nresult of amelioration was the object of a pious hope, and no more.\r\nCanning described the negro as a being with the form of a man and the\r\nintellect of a child. 'To turn him loose in the manhood of his physical\r\nstrength, in the maturity of his physical passions, but in the infancy\r\nof his uninstructed reason, would be to raise up a creature resembling\r\nthe splendid fiction of a recent romance,[20] the hero of which\r\nconstructs a human form with all the corporal capabilities of a man, but\r\nbeing unable to impart to the work of his hands a perception of right\r\nand wrong, he finds too late that he has only created a more than mortal\r\npower of doing mischief.' 'I was bred,' said Mr. Gladstone when risen to\r\nmeridian splendour, 'under the shadow of the great name of Canning;\r\nevery influence connected with that name governed the politics of my\r\nchildhood and of my youth; with Canning, I rejoiced in the removal of\r\nreligious disabilities, and in the character which he gave to our policy\r\nabroad; with Canning, I rejoiced in the opening he made towards the\r\nestablishment of free commercial interchanges between nations; with\r\nCanning, and under the shadow of the yet more venerable name of Burke,\r\nmy youthful mind and imagination were impressed.'[21] On slavery and\r\neven the slave trade, Burke too had argued against total abolition. 'I\r\nconfess,' he said, 'I trust infinitely more (according to the sound\r\nprinciples of those who ever have at any time meliorated the state of\r\nmankind) to the effect and influence of religion than to all the rest of\r\nthe regulations put together.'[22]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The freedom was formally bestowed on him in 1863.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir William Fraser died in 1898.\r\n\r\n[3] Researches into the ancestry of the Gladstone family have been made\r\nby Sir William Fraser, Professor John Veitch, and Mrs. Oliver of\r\nThornwood. Besides his special investigation of the genealogy of the\r\nfamily, Sir W. Fraser devoted some pages in the _Douglas Book_ to the\r\nGledstanes of Gledstanes. The surname of Gledstanes occurs at a very\r\nearly period in the records of Scotland. Families of that name acquired\r\nconsiderable landed estates in the counties of Lanark, Peebles,\r\nRoxburgh, and Dumfries. The old castle of Gledstanes, now in ruins, was\r\nthe principal mansion of the family. The first of the name who has been\r\nfound on record is Herbert de Gledstanes, who swore fealty to Edward I.\r\nin 1296 for lands in the county of Lanark. The Gledstanes long held the\r\noffice of bailie under the Earls of Douglas, and the connection between\r\nthe two families seems to have lasted until the fall of the Douglas\r\nfamily. The Gledstanes still continued to figure for many generations on\r\nthe border. About the middle of the eighteenth century two branches of\r\nthe family--the Gledstanes of Cocklaw and of Craigs--failed in the\r\ndirect male line. Mr. Gladstone was descended from a third branch, the\r\nGledstanes of Arthurshiel in Lanarkshire. The first of this line who has\r\nbeen traced is William Gledstanes, who in the year 1551 was laird of\r\nArthurshiel. His lineal descendants continued as owners of that property\r\ntill William Gledstanes disposed of it and went to live in the town of\r\nBiggar about the year 1679. This William Gledstanes was Mr. Gladstone's\r\ngreat-great-grandfather. The connection between these three branches and\r\nHerbert de Gledstanes of 1296 has not been ascertained, but he was\r\nprobably the common ancestor of them all.\r\n\r\n[4] John Gladstone built St. Thomas's Church, Seaforth, 1814-15; St.\r\nAndrew's, Liverpool, about 1816; the church at Leith; the Episcopal\r\nchapel at Fasque built and endowed about 1847.\r\n\r\n[5] Charles Simeon (1759-1836), who played as conspicuous a part in low\r\nchurch thought as Newman afterwards in high.\r\n\r\n[6] See below, pp. 106-7.\r\n\r\n[7] XII 58--'Removed from death by four or maybe seven fingers'\r\nbreadth.'\r\n\r\n[8] The fragment is undated.\r\n\r\n[9] One or two further genealogical _nugae_ are among the papers. A\r\ncorrespondent wrote to Mr. Gladstone in 1887: Among the donors to the\r\nCraftsman's Hospital, Aberdeen, established in 1833, occurs the name of\r\n'Georg Gladstaines, pewterer, 300 merks' (L16, 13s. 4d. sterling), 1698.\r\nGeorge joined the Hammerman Craft in 1656, when he would have been about\r\n25 years of age. His signature is still in existence appended to the\r\nburgess oath. Very few craftsmen could sign their names at that\r\nperiod--not one in twenty--so that George must have been fairly well\r\neducated. Mr. Gladstone replied that it was the first time that he had\r\nheard of the name so far north, and that the pewterer was probably one\r\nplanted out. At Dundee (1890) he mentioned that others of his name and\r\nblood appeared on the burgess-roll as early as the fifteenth century. As\r\nfor his maternal grandfather, the _Inverness Courier_ (March 2, year not\r\ngiven) has the following:--'Provost Robertson of Dingwall was a\r\ndescendant of the ancient family of the Robertsons of Inshes, of whose\r\nearly settlement in the north the following particulars are known: The\r\nfirst was a member of the family of Struan, Perthshire, and was a\r\nmerchant in Inverness in 1420. In the battle of _Blair-na-leine_, fought\r\nat the west end of Loch-Lochy in 1544, John Robertson, a descendant of\r\nthe above, acted as standard-bearer to Lord Lovat. This battle was\r\nfought between the Frasers and Macdonalds of Clanranald, and derived its\r\nappellation from the circumstance of the combatants fighting only in\r\ntheir shirts. The contest was carried on with such bloody determination,\r\nfoot to foot and claymore to claymore, that only _four_ of the Frasers\r\nand _ten_ of the Macdonalds returned to tell the tale. The former family\r\nwas well nigh extirpated; tradition, however, states that sixteen widows\r\nof the Frasers who had been slain, shortly afterwards, as a providential\r\nsuccour, gave birth to sixteen sons! From the bloody onslaught at\r\nLoch-Lochy young Robertson returned home scaithless, and his brave and\r\ngallant conduct was the theme of praise with all. Some time thereafter\r\nhe married the second daughter of Paterson of Wester and Easter Inshes,\r\nthe eldest being married to Cuthbert of Macbeth's Castlehill, now known\r\nas the Crown lands, possessed by Mr. Fraser of Abertarff. On the death\r\nof Paterson, his father-in-law, Wester Inshes became the property of\r\nyoung Robertson, and Easter Inshes that of the Cuthberts, who, for the\r\nsake of distinction, changed the name to Castlehill. The Robertsons, in\r\nregular succession until the present time, possess the fine estate of\r\nInshes; while that of Castlehill, which belonged to the powerful\r\nCuthberts for so many generations, knows them no more. The family of\r\nInshes, in all ages, stood high in respect throughout the highlands, and\r\nmany of them had signalised themselves in upholding the rights of their\r\ncountry; and the worthy Provost Robertson of Dingwall had no less\r\ndistinguished himself, who, with other important reforms, had cleared\r\naway the last burdensome relic of feudal times in that ancient burgh.'\r\n\r\n[10] The other sons and daughters of this marriage were Thomas, _d._\r\n1889; Robertson, _d._ 1875; John Neilson, _d._ 1863; Anne, _d._ 1829;\r\nHelen Jane, _d._ 1880.\r\n\r\n[11] At Dundee, Oct. 29, 1890.\r\n\r\n[12] In 1835 formal difficulties arose in connection with the purchase\r\nof a government annuity, and then he seems to have taken out letters\r\npatent authorising the change in the name.\r\n\r\n[13] _Memoirs of J.

The rate of compensation per slave averaged L51, 17s.\r\n1/2d., but it is of interest to note that the slaves on the Vreedenhoop\r\nestate were valued at L53, 15s. 6d.\r\n\r\n[18] _Dict. Nat.

Life at Eton\r\nlasted over six years, until the Christmas of 1827. It impressed images\r\nthat never faded, and left traces in heart and mind that the waves of\r\ntime never effaced,--so profound is the early writing on our opening\r\npage. Canning's words at the head of our present chapter set forth a\r\nsuperstition that had a powerful hold on the English governing class of\r\nthat day, and the new Etonian never shook it off. His attachment to Eton\r\ngrew with the lapse of years; to him it was ever 'the queen of all\r\nschools.'\r\n\r\n'I went,' he says, 'under the wing of my eldest brother, then in the\r\nupper division, and this helped my start and much mitigated the sense of\r\nisolation that attends the first launch at a public school.' The door of\r\nhis dame's house looked down the Long Walk, while the windows looked\r\ninto the very crowded churchyard: from this he never received the\r\nsmallest inconvenience, though it was his custom (when master of the\r\nroom) to sleep with his window open both summer and winter. The school,\r\nsaid the new scholar, has only about four hundred and ninety fellows in\r\nit, which was considered uncommonly small. He likes his tutor so much\r\nthat he would not exchange him for any ten. He has various rows with\r\nMrs. Shurey, his dame, and it is really a great shame the way they are\r\nfed. He and his brother have far the best room in the dame's house. His\r\ncaptain is very good-natured. Fighting is a favourite diversion, hardly\r\na day passing without one, two, three, or even four more or less mortal\r\ncombats.\r\n\r\n                         MANNERS AT ETON\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear, he writes to his Highland aunt Johanna\r\n(November 13, 1821), of an instance of the highest and most honourable\r\nspirit in a highlander labouring under great disadvantages. His name is\r\nMacdonald (he once had a brother here remarkably clever, and a capital\r\nfighter). He is tough as iron, and about the strongest fellow in the\r\nschool of his size. Being pushed out of his seat in school by a fellow\r\nof the name of Arthur, he airily asked him to give it him again, which\r\nbeing refused, with the additional insult that he might try what he\r\ncould do to take it from him, Macdonald very properly took him at his\r\nword, and began to push him out of his seat. Arthur struck at him with\r\nall his might, and gave him so violent a blow that Macdonald was almost\r\nknocked backwards, but disdaining to take a blow from even a fellow much\r\nbigger than himself, he returned Arthur's blow with interest; they began\r\nto fight; after Macdonald had made him bleed at both his nose and his\r\nmouth, he finished the affair very triumphantly by knocking the arrogant\r\nArthur backwards over the form without receiving a single blow of any\r\nconsequence. He also labours under the additional disadvantage of being\r\na new fellow, and of not knowing any one here. Arthur in a former battle\r\nput his finger out of joint, and as soon as it is recovered they are to\r\nhave a regular battle in the playing fields.\r\n\r\nOther encounters are described with equal zest, especially one where\r\n'the honour of Liverpool was bravely sustained,' superior weight and\r\nsize having such an advantage over toughness and strength, that the foe\r\nof Liverpool was too badly bruised and knocked about to appear in\r\nschool. On another occasion, 'to the great joy' of the narrator, an\r\noppidan vanquished a colleger, though the colleger fought so furiously\r\nthat he put his fingers out of joint, and went back to the classic\r\nstudies that soften manners, with a face broken and quite black. The\r\nWindsor and Slough coaches used to stop under the wall of the playing\r\nfields to watch these desperate affrays, and once at least in these\r\ntimes a boy was killed. With plenty of fighting went on plenty of\r\nflogging; for the headmaster was the redoubtable Dr. Keate, with whom\r\nthe appointed instrument of moral regeneration in the childish soul was\r\nthe birch rod; who on heroic occasions was known to have flogged over\r\neighty boys on a single summer day; and whose one mellow regret in the\r\nevening of his life was that he had not flogged far more. Religious\r\ninstruction, as we may suppose, was under these circumstances reduced to\r\nzero; there was no trace of the influence of the evangelical party, at\r\nthat moment the most active of all the religious sections; and the\r\nancient and pious munificence of Henry VI. now inspired a scene that was\r\nessentially little better than pagan, modified by an official church of\r\nEngland varnish. At Eton, Mr. Gladstone wrote of this period forty years\r\nafter, 'the actual teaching of Christianity was all but dead, though\r\nhappily none of its forms had been surrendered.'[23]\r\n\r\nScience even in its rudiments fared as ill as its eternal rival,\r\ntheology. There was a mathematical master, but nobody learned anything\r\nfrom him, or took any notice of him. In his anxiety for position the\r\nunfortunate man asked Keate if he might wear a cap and gown. 'That's as\r\nyou please,' said Keate. 'Must the boys touch their hats to me?' 'That's\r\nas they please,' replied the genial doctor.[24] Gladstone first picked\r\nup a little mathematics, not at Eton, but during the holidays, going to\r\nLiverpool for the purpose, first in 1824 and more seriously in 1827. He\r\nseems to have paid much attention to French, and even then to have\r\nattained considerable proficiency. 'When I was at Eton,' Mr. Gladstone\r\nsaid, 'we knew very little indeed, but we knew it accurately.' 'There\r\nwere many shades of distinction,' he observed, 'among the fellows who\r\nreceived what was supposed to be, and was in many respects, their\r\neducation. Some of those shades of distinction were extremely\r\nquestionable, and the comparative measures of honour allotted to talent,\r\nindustry, and idleness were undoubtedly such as philosophy would not\r\njustify. But no boy was ever estimated either more or less because he\r\nhad much money to spend. It added nothing to him if he had much, it took\r\nnothing from him if he had little.' A sharp fellow who worked, and a\r\nstupid fellow who was idle, were both of them in good odour enough, but\r\na stupid boy who presumed to work was held to be an insufferable\r\nsolecism.[25]\r\n\r\n                           KNOWLEDGE AT ETON\r\n\r\n     My tutor was the Rev. H. H. Knapp (practically all tutors were\r\n     clergymen in those days). He was a reputed whig, an easy and\r\n     kind-tempered man with a sense of scholarship, but no power of\r\n     discipline, and no energy of desire to impress himself upon his\r\n     pupils. I recollect but one piece of advice received later from\r\n     him. It was that I should form my poetical taste upon Darwin, whose\r\n     poems (the 'Botanic Garden' and 'Loves of the Plants') I obediently\r\n     read through in consequence. I was placed in the middle remove\r\n     fourth form, a place slightly better than the common run, but\r\n     inferior to what a boy of good preparation or real excellence would\r\n     have taken. My nearest friend of the first period was W. W. Parr, a\r\n     boy of intelligence, something over my age, next above me in the\r\n     school.\r\n\r\n     At this time there was not in me any desire to know or to excel. My\r\n     first pursuits were football and then cricket; the first I did not\r\n     long pursue, and in the second I never managed to rise above\r\n     mediocrity and what was termed 'the twenty-two.' There was a\r\n     barrister named Henry Hall Joy, a connection of my father through\r\n     his first wife, and a man who had taken a first-class at Oxford. He\r\n     was very kind to me, and had made some efforts to inspire me with a\r\n     love of books, if not of knowledge. Indeed I had read Froissart,\r\n     and Hume with Smollett, but only for the battles, and always\r\n     skipping when I came to the sections headed 'A Parliament.' Joy had\r\n     a taste for classics, and made visions for me of honours at Oxford.\r\n     But the subject only danced before my eyes as a will-of-the-wisp,\r\n     and without attracting me. I remained stagnant without heart or\r\n     hope. A change however arrived about Easter 1822. My 'remove' was\r\n     then under Hawtrey (afterwards head-master and provost), who was\r\n     always on the lookout for any bud which he could warm with a little\r\n     sunshine.\r\n\r\nHe always described Hawtrey as the life of the school, the man to whom\r\nEton owed more than to any of her sons during the century. Though not\r\nhis pupil, it was from him that Gladstone, when in the fourth form,\r\nreceived for the first time incentives to exertion. 'It was entirely due\r\nto Hawtrey,' he records in a fragment, 'that I first owed the reception\r\nof a spark, the _divinae particulam aurae_, and conceived a dim idea,\r\nthat in some time, manner, and degree, I might come to know. Even then,\r\nas I had really no instructor, my efforts at Eton, down to 1827, were\r\nperhaps of the purest plodding ever known.'\r\n\r\nEvidently he was not a boy of special mark during the first three years\r\nat Eaton. In the evening he played chess and cards, and usually lost. He\r\nclaimed in after life that he had once taken a drive in a hired tandem,\r\nbut Etonians who knew him as a schoolboy decided that an aspiring memory\r\nhere made him boast of crimes that were not his. He was assiduous in the\r\nEton practice of working a small boat, whether skiff, funny, or wherry,\r\nsingle-handed. In the masquerade of Montem he figured complacently in\r\nall the glories of the costume of a Greek patriot, for he was a faithful\r\nCanningite; the heroic struggle against the Turk was at its fiercest,\r\nand it was the year when Byron died at Missolonghi. Of Montem as an\r\ninstitution he thought extremely ill, 'the whole thing a wretched waste\r\nof time and money, a most ingenious contrivance to exhibit us as\r\nbaboons, a bore in the full sense of the word.' He did not stand aside\r\nfrom the harmless gaieties of boyish life, but he rigidly refused any\r\npart in boyish indecorums. He was, in short, just the diligent,\r\ncheerful, healthy-minded schoolboy that any good father would have his\r\nson to be. He enjoys himself with his brother at the Christopher, and is\r\nglad to record that 'Keate did not make any jaw about being so late.'\r\nHalf a dozen of them met every whole holiday or half, and went up Salt\r\nHill to bully the fat waiter, eat toasted cheese, and drink egg-wine.\r\n\r\n                             SCHOOL DAYS\r\n\r\nHe started, as we have already seen, in middle fourth form. In the\r\nspring of 1822 Hawtrey said to him: 'Continue to do as well as this, and\r\nI will send you up for good again before the fourth of June.' Before the\r\nend of June, he tells his sailor brother of his success: 'It far exceeds\r\nthe most sanguine expectations I ever entertained. I have got into the\r\nremove between the fourth and fifth forms. I have been sent up for good\r\na second time, and have taken seven places.' In the summer of 1823 he\r\nannounces that he has got into the fifth form after taking sixteen\r\nplaces, and here instead of fagging he acquires the blessed power\r\nhimself to fag. In passing he launches, for the first recorded time,\r\nagainst the master of the remove from which he has just been promoted,\r\nan invective that in volume and intensity anticipates the wrath of later\r\nattacks on Neapolitan kings and Turkish sultans.\r\n\r\nHis letters written from Eton breathe in every line the warm breath of\r\nfamily affection, and of all those natural pieties that had so firm a\r\nroot in him from the beginning to the end. Of the later store of genius\r\nand force that the touch of time was so soon to kindle into full glow,\r\nthey gave but little indication. We smile at the precocious _copia\r\nfandi_ that at thirteen describes the language of an admonishing\r\nacquaintance as 'so friendly, manly, sound, and disinterested that\r\nnotwithstanding his faults I must always think well of him.' He sends\r\ncontributions to his brother's scrap-book, and one of the first of them,\r\noddly enough, in view of one of the great preoccupations of his later\r\nlife, is a copy of Lord Edward Fitzgerald's stanzas on the night of his\r\narrest:--\r\n\r\n  'O Ireland, my country, the hour\r\n     Of thy pride and thy splendour has passed.\r\n   And the chain which was spurned in thy moment of power,\r\n     Hangs heavy around thee at last.'\r\n\r\nThe temper and dialect of evangelical religion are always there. A\r\nfriend of the family dies, and the boy pours out his regret, but after\r\nall what is the merely natural death of Dr. N. compared with the awful\r\nstate of a certain clergyman, also an intimate friend, who has not only\r\nbeen guilty of attending a fancy ball, but has followed that vicious\r\nprelude by even worse enormities, unnamed, that surely cannot escape the\r\nvigilance and the reproof of his bishop?\r\n\r\nHis father is the steady centre of his life. 'My father,' he writes to\r\nhis brother, 'is as active in mind and projects as ever; he has two\r\nprincipal plans now in embryo. One of these is a railroad between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester for the conveyance of goods by\r\nlocomotive-steam-engine. The other is for building a bridge over the\r\nMersey at Runcorn.' In May 1827, the Gloucester and Berkeley canal is\r\nopened: 'a great and enterprising undertaking, but still there is no\r\nfear of it beating Liverpool.' Meanwhile, 'what prodigiously quick\r\ntravelling to leave Eton at twelve on Monday, and reach home at eight on\r\nTuesday!' 'I have,' he says in 1826, 'lately been writing several\r\nletters in the _Liverpool Courier_.' His father had been attacked in the\r\nlocal prints for sundry economic inconsistencies, and the controversial\r\npen that was to know no rest for more than seventy years to come, was\r\nnow first employed, like the pious AEneas bearing off Anchises, in the\r\nfilial duty of repelling his sire's assailants. Ignorant of his nameless\r\nchampion, John Gladstone was much amused and interested by the anonymous\r\n'Friend to Fair Dealing,' while the son was equally diverted by the\r\ncriticisms and conjectures of the parent.\r\n\r\n                          YOUTHFUL READING\r\n\r\nWith the formidable Keate the boy seems to have fared remarkably well,\r\nand there are stories that he was even one of the tyrant's\r\nfavourites.[26] His school work was diligently supplemented. His daily\r\nreading in 1826 covers a good deal of miscellaneous ground, including\r\nMoliere and Racine, Blair's _Sermons_ ('not very substantial'), _Tom\r\nJones_, Tomline's _Life of Pitt_, Waterland's _Commentaries_, Leslie _on\r\nDeism_, Locke's _Defence of The Reasonableness of Christianity_, which\r\nhe finds excellent; _Paradise Lost_, Milton's _Latin Poems_ and\r\n_Epitaphium Damonis_ ('exquisite'), Massinger's _Fatal Dowry_ ('most\r\nexcellent'), Ben Jonson's _Alchemist_; Scott, including the _Bride of\r\nLammermoor_ ('a beautiful tale, indeed,' and in after life his favourite\r\nof them all), Burke, Clarendon, and others of the shining host whose\r\nvery names are music to a scholar's ear. In the same year he reads 'a\r\nmost violent article on Milton by Macaulay, fair and unfair, clever and\r\nsilly, allegorical and bombastic, republican and anti-episcopal--a\r\nstrange composition, indeed.' In 1827 he went steadily through the\r\nsecond half of Gibbon, whom he pronounces, 'elegant and acute as he is,\r\nnot so clear, so able, so attractive as Hume; does not impress my mind\r\nso much.' In the same year he reads Coxe's _Walpole_, _Don Quixote_,\r\nHallam's _Constitutional History_, _Measure for Measure_ and _Much Ado_,\r\nMassinger's _Grand Duke of Florence_, Ford's _Love's Melancholy_ ('much\r\nof it good, the end remarkably beautiful') and _Broken Heart_ (which he\r\nliked better than either the other or _'Tis Pity_), Locke _on\r\nToleration_ ('much repetition').\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a steady refrain of Greek iambics, Greek anapaests,\r\n'an easy and nice metre,' 'a hodge-podge lot of hendecasyllables,' and\r\nthirty alcaic stanzas for a holiday task. Mention is made of many\r\nsermons on 'Redeeming the time,' 'Weighed in the balance and found\r\nwanting,' 'Cease to do evil, learn to do well,' and the other ever\r\nunexhausted texts. One constant entry, we may be sure, is 'Read Bible,'\r\nwith Mant's notes. In a mood of deep piety he is prepared for\r\nconfirmation. His appearance at this time was recalled by one who had\r\nbeen his fag, 'as a good-looking, rather delicate youth, with a pale\r\nface and brown curling hair, always tidy and well dressed.'[27]\r\n\r\nHe became captain of the fifth at the end of October 1826, and on\r\nFebruary 20, 1827, Keate put him into the sixth. 'Was very civil,\r\nindeed; told me to take pains, etc.: to be careful in using my\r\nauthority, etc.' He finds the sixth very preferable to all other parts\r\nof the school, both as regards pleasure and opportunity for improvement.\r\nThey are more directly under the eye of Keate; he treats them with more\r\ncivility and speaks to them differently. So the days follow one another\r\nvery much alike--studious, cheerful, sociable, sedulous. The debates in\r\nparliament take up a good deal of his time, and he is overwhelmed by the\r\nhorrible news of the defeat of the catholics in the House of Commons\r\n(March 8,1827). On a summer's day in 1826, 'Mr. Canning here; inquired\r\nafter me and missed me.' He was not at Eton but at home when he heard of\r\nMr. Canning's death. 'Personally I must remember his kindness and\r\ncondescension, especially when he spoke to me of some verses which H.\r\nJoy had injudiciously mentioned to him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                           DEBATING SOCIETY\r\n\r\nYouthful intellect is imitative, and in a great school so impregnated as\r\nEton with the spirit of public life and political association, the few\r\nboys with active minds mimicked the strife of parliament in their\r\ndebating society, and copied the arts of journalism in the _Eton\r\nMiscellany_. In both fields the young Gladstone took a leading part. The\r\ndebating society was afflicted with 'the premonitory lethargy of death,'\r\nbut the assiduous energy of Gaskell, seconded by the gifts of Gladstone,\r\nHallam, and Doyle, soon sent a new pulse beating through it. The\r\npolitics of the hour, that is to say everything not fifty years off,\r\nwere forbidden ground; but the execution of Strafford or of his royal\r\nmaster, the deposition of Richard II., the last four years of the reign\r\nof Queen Anne, the Peerage bill of 1719, the characters of Harley and\r\nBolingbroke, were themes that could be made by ingenious youth to admit\r\na hundred cunning sidelights upon the catholic question, the struggle of\r\nthe Greeks for independence, the hard case of Queen Caroline, and the\r\nunlawfulness of swamping the tories in the House of Lords. On duller\r\nafternoons they argued on the relative claims of mathematics and\r\nmetaphysics to be the better discipline of the human mind; whether\r\nduelling is or is not inconsistent with the character that we ought to\r\nseek; or whether the education of the poor is on the whole beneficial.\r\nIt was on this last question (October 29, 1825) that the orator who made\r\nhis last speech seventy years later, now made his first. 'Made my first\r\nor maiden speech at the society,' he enters in his diary, 'on education\r\nof the poor; funked less than I thought I should, by much.' It is a\r\ncurious but a characteristic circumstance not that so many of his Eton\r\nspeeches were written out, but that the manuscript should have been\r\nthriftily preserved by him all through the long space of intervening\r\nyears. 'Mr. President,' it begins, 'in this land of liberty, in this age\r\nof increased and gradually increasing civilization, we shall hope to\r\nfind few, if indeed any, among the higher classes who are eager or\r\nwilling to obstruct the moral instruction and mental improvement of\r\ntheir fellow creatures in the humbler walks of life. If such there are,\r\nlet them at length remember that the poor are endowed with the same\r\nreason, though not blessed with the same temporal advantages. Let them\r\nbut admit, what I think no one can deny, that they are placed in an\r\nelevated situation principally for the purpose of doing good to their\r\nfellow creatures. Then by what argument can they repel, by what pretence\r\ncan they evade the duty?' And so forth and so forth. Already we seem to\r\nhear the born speaker in the amplitude of rhetorical form in which,\r\njuvenile though it may be, a commonplace is cast. 'Is human grandeur so\r\nstable that they may deny to others that which they would in an humble\r\nsituation desire themselves? Or has human pride reached such a pitch of\r\narrogance that they have learned to defy both right and reason, to\r\nreject the laws of natural kindness that ought to reign in the breast of\r\nall, and to look on their fellow countrymen as the refuse of mankind?...\r\nIs it morally just or politically expedient to keep down the industry\r\nand genius of the artisan, to blast his rising hopes, to quell his\r\nspirit? A thirst for knowledge has arisen in the minds of the poor; let\r\nthem satisfy it with wholesome nutriment and beware lest driven to\r\ndespair,' et cetera. Crude enough, if we please; but the year was 1826,\r\nand we may feel that the boyish speaker is already on the generous side\r\nand has the gift of fruitful sympathies.\r\n\r\nIn the spacious tournaments of old history, we may smile to hear\r\ndebating forms and ceremony applied to everlasting controversies. 'Sir,'\r\nhe opens on one occasion, 'I declare that as far as regards myself, I\r\nshall have very little difficulty in stating my grounds on which I give\r\nmy vote for James Graham [the Marquis of Montrose]. It is because I look\r\nupon him as a hero, not merely endowed with that animal ferocity which\r\nhas often been the sole qualification which has obtained men that\r\nappellation from the multitude--I should be sorry indeed if he had no\r\ntestimonials of his merits, save such as arise from the mad and\r\nthoughtless exclamations of popular applause.' In the same gallant style\r\n(Jan. 26, 1826) he votes for Marcus Aurelius, in answer to the question\r\nwhether Trajan has any equal among the Roman emperors from Augustus\r\nonwards. Another time the question was between John Hampden and\r\nClarendon. 'Sir, I look back with pleasure to the time when we\r\nunanimously declared our disapprobation of the impeachment of the Earl\r\nof Strafford. I wish I could hope for the same unanimity now, but I will\r\nendeavour to regulate myself by the same principles as directed me\r\nthen.... Now, sir, with regard to the impeachment of the five members,\r\nit is really a little extraordinary to hear the honourable opener\r\ntalking of the violence offered by the king, and the terror of the\r\nparliament. Sir, do we not all know that the king at that time had\r\nneither friends nor wealth?... Did the return of these members with a\r\ntriumphant mob accompanying them indicate terror? Did the demands of\r\nthe parliament or the insolence of their language show it?' So he\r\nproceeds through all the well-worn arguments; and 'therefore it is,' he\r\nconcludes, 'that I give my vote to the Earl of Clarendon, because he\r\ngave his support to the falling cause of monarchy; because he stood by\r\nhis church and his king; because he adopted the part which loyalty,\r\nreason, and moderation combined to dictate.... Poverty, banishment, and\r\ndisgrace he endured without a murmur; he still adhered to the cause of\r\njustice, he still denounced the advocates of rebellion, and if he failed\r\nin his reward in life, oh, sir, let us not deny it to him after death.\r\nIn him, sir, I admire the sound philosopher, the rigid moralist, the\r\nupright statesman, the candid historian.... In Hampden I see the\r\nsplendour of patriotic bravery obscured by the darkness of rebellion,\r\nand the faculties by which he might have been a real hero and real\r\nmartyr, prostituted in the cause,' and so on, with all the promise of\r\nthe _os magna soniturum_, of which time was to prove the resources so\r\ninexhaustible. On one great man he passed a final judgment that years\r\ndid not change:--'Debate on Sir R. Walpole: Hallam, Gaskell, Pickering,\r\nand Doyle spoke. Voted for him. Last time, when I was almost entirely\r\nignorant of the subject, against him. There were sundry considerable\r\nblots, but nothing to overbalance or to spoil the great merit of being\r\nthe bulwark of the protestant succession, his commercial measures, and\r\nin general his pacific policy.'[28]\r\n\r\n                            ETON MISCELLANY\r\n\r\nAs for the _Eton Miscellany_, which was meant to follow earlier attempts\r\nin the same line, the best-natured critic cannot honestly count it\r\ndazzling. Such things rarely are; for youth, though the most adorable of\r\nour human stages, cannot yet have knowledge or practice enough, whether\r\nin life or books, to make either good prose or stirring verse, unless by\r\na miracle of genius, and even that inspiration is but occasional. The\r\n_Microcosm_ (1786-87) and the _Etonian_ (1818), with such hands as\r\nCanning and Frere, Moultrie and Praed, were well enough. The newcomer\r\nwas a long way behind these in the freshness, brilliance, daring, by\r\nwhich only such juvenile performances can either please or interest.\r\nGeorge Selwyn and Gladstone were joint editors, and each provided pretty\r\ncopious effusions. 'I cannot keep my temper,' he wrote afterwards in his\r\ndiary in 1835, on turning over the _Miscellany_, 'in perusing my own\r\n(with few exceptions) execrable productions.' Certainly his\r\ncontributions have no particular promise or savour, no hint of the\r\nstrong pinions into which the half-fledged wings were in time to expand.\r\nTheir motion, such as it is, must be pronounced mechanical; their phrase\r\nand cadence conventional. Even when sincere feelings were deeply\r\nstirred, the flight cannot be called high. The most moving public event\r\nin his schooldays was undoubtedly the death of Canning, and to Gladstone\r\nthe stroke was almost personal. In September 1827 he tells his mother\r\nthat he has for the first time visited Westminster Abbey,--his object,\r\nan eager pilgrimage to the newly tenanted grave of his hero, and in the\r\n_Miscellany_ he pays a double tribute. In the prose we hear sonorous\r\nthings about meridian splendour, premature extinction, and inscrutable\r\nwisdom; about falling, like his great master Pitt, a victim to his proud\r\nand exalted station; about being firm in principle and conciliatory in\r\naction, the friend of improvement and the enemy of innovation. Nor are\r\nthe versified reflections in Westminster Abbey much more striking:--\r\n\r\n  Oft in the sculptured aisle and swelling dome,\r\n  The yawning grave hath given the proud a home;\r\n  Yet never welcomed from his bright career\r\n  A mightier victim than it welcomed here:\r\n  Again the tomb may yawn--again may death\r\n  Claim the last forfeit of departing breath;\r\n  Yet ne'er enshrine in slumber dark and deep\r\n  A nobler, loftier prey than where thine ashes sleep.\r\n\r\nExcellent in feeling, to be sure; but as a trial of poetic delicacy or\r\npower, wanting the true note, and only worth recalling for an instant as\r\nwe go.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                                FRIENDS\r\n\r\nAs nearly always happens, it was less by school work or spoken addresses\r\nin juvenile debate, or early attempts in the great and difficult art of\r\nwritten composition, than by blithe and congenial comradeship that the\r\nmind of the young Gladstone was stimulated, opened, strengthened. In\r\nafter days he commemorated among his friends George Selwyn, afterwards\r\nbishop of New Zealand and of Lichfield, 'a man whose character is summed\r\nup, from alpha to omega, in the single word, noble, and whose high\r\noffice, in a large measure, it was to reintroduce among the anglican\r\nclergy the pure heroic type.' Another was Francis Doyle, 'whose genial\r\ncharacter supplied a most pleasant introduction for his unquestionable\r\npoetic genius.' A third was James Milnes Gaskell, a youth endowed with\r\nprecocious ripeness of political faculty, an enthusiast, and with a\r\nvivacious humour that enthusiasts often miss. Doyle said of him that his\r\nnurse must have lulled him to sleep by parliamentary reports, and his\r\nfirst cries on awaking in his cradle must have been 'hear, hear'!\r\nProximity of rooms 'gave occasion or aid to the formation of another\r\nvery valuable friendship, that with Gerald Wellesley, afterwards dean of\r\nWindsor, which lasted, to my great profit, for some sixty years, until\r\nthat light was put out.' In Gaskell's room four or five of them would\r\nmeet, and discuss without restraint the questions of politics that were\r\ntoo modern to be tolerated in public debate. Most of them were friendly\r\nto catholic emancipation, and to the steps by which Huskisson, supported\r\nby Canning, was cautiously treading in the path towards free trade. The\r\nbrightest star in this cheerful constellation was the rare youth who,\r\nthough his shining course was run in two-and-twenty years, yet in that\r\nscanty span was able to impress with his vigorous understanding and\r\ngraceful imagination more than one of the loftiest minds of his\r\ntime.[29] Arthur Hallam was a couple of years younger than Gladstone, no\r\nnarrow gulf at that age; but such was the sympathy of genius, such the\r\naffinities of intellectual interest and aspiration spoken and unspoken,\r\nsuch the charm and the power of the younger with the elder, that rapid\r\ninstinct made them close comrades. They clubbed together their rolls and\r\nbutter, and breakfasted in one another's rooms. Hallam was not strong\r\nenough for boating, so the more sinewy Gladstone used to scull him up to\r\nthe Shallows, and he regarded this toilsome carrying of an idle\r\npassenger up stream as proof positive of no common value set upon his\r\npassenger's company. They took walks together, often to the monument of\r\nGray, close by the churchyard of the elegy; arguing about the articles\r\nand the creeds; about Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley; about free will, for\r\nHallam was precociously full of Jonathan Edwards; about politics, old\r\nand new, living and dead; about Pitt and Fox, and Canning and Peel, for\r\nGladstone was a tory and Hallam pure whig. Hallam was described by Mr.\r\nGladstone in his old age as one who 'enjoyed work, enjoyed society; and\r\ngames which he did not enjoy he left contentedly aside. His temper was\r\nas sweet as his manners were winning. His conduct was without a spot or\r\neven a speck. He was that rare and blessed creature, _anima naturaliter\r\nChristiana_. He read largely, and though not superficial, yet with an\r\nextraordinary speed. He had no high or exclusive ways.' Thus, as so many\r\nhave known in that happy dawn of life, before any of the imps of\r\ndisorder and confusion have found their way into the garden, it was the\r\nmost careless hours,--careless of all save truth and beauty,--that were\r\nthe hours best filled.\r\n\r\n                            ARTHUR HALLAM\r\n\r\nYouth will commonly do anything rather than write letters, but the\r\nfriendship of this pair stood even that test. The pages are redolent of\r\na living taste for good books and serious thoughts, and amply redeemed\r\nfrom strain or affectation by touches of gay irony and the collegian's\r\nbanter. Hallam applies to Gladstone Diomede's lines about Odysseus, of\r\neager heart and spirit so manful in all manner of toils, as the only\r\ncomrade whom a man would choose.[30] But the Greek hero was no doubt a\r\ncomplex character, and the parallel is taken by Gladstone as an\r\nequivocal compliment. So Hallam begs him at any rate to accept the other\r\ndescription, how when he uttered his mighty voice from his chest, and\r\nwords fell like flakes of snow in winter, then could no mortal man\r\ncontend with Odysseus.[31] As happy a forecast for the great orator of\r\ntheir generation, as when in 1829 he told Gladstone that Tennyson\r\npromised fair to be its greatest poet. Hallam's share in the\r\ncorrespondence reminds us of the friendship of two other Etonians ninety\r\nyears before, of the letters and verses that Gray wrote to Richard West;\r\nthere is the same literary sensibility, the same kindness, but there is\r\nwhat Gray and West felt not, the breath of a busy and changing age. Each\r\nof these two had the advantage of coming from a home where politics were\r\nnot mere gossip about persons and paragraphs, but were matters of\r\ntrained and continued interest. The son of one of the most eminent of\r\nthe brilliant band of the whig writers of that day, Hallam passes\r\nglowing eulogies on the patriotism and wisdom of the whigs in coalescing\r\nwith Canning against the bigotry of the king and the blunders of\r\nWellington and Peel; he contrasts this famous crisis with a similar\r\ncrisis in the early part of the reign of George III.; and observes how\r\nmuch higher all parties stood in the balance of disinterestedness and\r\npublic virtue. He goes to the opera and finds Zucchelli admirable,\r\nCoradori divine. He wonders (1826) about Sir Walter's forthcoming life\r\nof Napoleon, how with his ultra principles Scott will manage to make a\r\nhero of the Corsican. He asks if Gladstone has read 'the new _Vivian\r\nGrey_' (1827)--the second part of that amazing fiction into which an\r\nauthor, not much older than themselves and destined to strange historic\r\nrelations with one of them, had the year before burst upon the world.\r\nHallam is not without the graceful melancholy of youth, so different\r\nfrom that other melancholy of ripe years and the deepening twilight.\r\nUnder all is the recurrent note of a grave refrain that fatal issues\r\nmade pathetic.\r\n\r\n'Never since the time when I first knew you,' Hallam wrote to Gladstone\r\n(June 23, 1830), 'have I ceased to love and respect your character ...\r\nIt will be my proudest thought that I may henceforth act worthily of\r\ntheir affection who, like yourself, have influenced my mind for good in\r\nthe earliest season of its development. Circumstance, my dear Gladstone,\r\nhas indeed separated our paths, but it can never do away with what has\r\nbeen. The stamp of each of our minds is on the other. Many a habit of\r\nthought in each is modified, many a feeling is associated, which never\r\nwould have existed in that combination, had it not been for the old\r\nfamiliar days when we lived together.'\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1827 Hallam quitted Eton for the journey to Italy that\r\nset so important a mark on his literary growth, and he bade his friend\r\nfarewell in words of characteristic affection. 'Perhaps you will pardon\r\nmy doing by writing what I hardly dare trust myself to do by words. I\r\nreceived your superb Burke yesterday; and hope to find it a memorial of\r\npast and a pledge for future friendship through both our lives. It is\r\nperhaps rather bold in me to ask a favour immediately on acknowledging\r\nso great a one; but you would please me, and oblige me greatly, if you\r\nwill accept this copy of my father's book. It may serve when I am\r\nseparated from you, to remind you of one, whose warmest pleasure it will\r\nalways be to subscribe himself, Your most faithful friend, A. H. H.'\r\n\r\nA few entries from the schoolboy's diary may serve to bring the daily\r\nscene before us, and show what his life was like:--\r\n\r\n     _October 3, 1826._--Holiday. Walk with Hallam.

Went to see a cricket match after\r\n     4.\r\n\r\n                           FAREWELL TO ETON\r\n\r\nGladstone's farewell to Eton came with Christmas (1827). He writes to\r\nhis sister his last Etonian letter (December 2) before departure, and\r\n'melancholy that departure is.' On the day before, he had made his\r\nvaledictory speech to the Society, and the empty shelves and dismantled\r\nwalls, the table strewn with papers, the books packed away in their\r\nboxes, have the effect of 'mingling in one lengthened mass all the\r\nboyish hopes and solicitudes and pleasures' of his Eton life. 'I have\r\nlong ago made up my mind that I have of late been enjoying what will in\r\nall probability be, as far as my own individual case is concerned, the\r\nhappiest years of my life. And they have fled! From these few facts do\r\nwe not draw a train of reflections awfully important in their nature and\r\nextremely powerful in their impression on the mind?'\r\n\r\n                              DR. KEATE\r\n\r\nTwo reminiscences of Eton always gave him, and those who listened to\r\nhim, much diversion whenever chance brought them to his mind, and he has\r\nset them down in an autobiographic fragment, for which this is the\r\nplace:--\r\n\r\n     To Dr. Keate nature had accorded a stature of only about five feet,\r\n     or say five feet one; but by costume, voice, manner (including a\r\n     little swagger), and character he made himself in every way the\r\n     capital figure on the Eton stage, and his departure marked, I\r\n     imagine, the departure of the old race of English public school\r\n     masters, as the name of Dr. Busby seems to mark its introduction.\r\n     In connection with his name I shall give two anecdotes separated by\r\n     a considerable interval of years. About the year 1820, the\r\n     eloquence of Dr. Edward Irving drew crowds to his church in London,\r\n     which was presbyterian. It required careful previous arrangements\r\n     to secure comfortable accommodation. The preacher was solemn,\r\n     majestic (notwithstanding the squint), and impressive; carrying all\r\n     the appearance of devoted earnestness. My father had on a certain\r\n     occasion, when I was still a small Eton boy, taken time by the\r\n     forelock, and secured the use of a convenient pew in the first rank\r\n     of the gallery. From this elevated situation we surveyed at ease\r\n     and leisure the struggling crowds below. The crush was everywhere\r\n     great, but greatest of all in the centre aisle. Here the mass of\r\n     human beings, mercilessly compressed, swayed continually backwards\r\n     and forwards. There was I, looking down with infinite complacency\r\n     and satisfaction from this honourable vantage ground upon the floor\r\n     of the church, filled and packed as one of our public meetings is,\r\n     with people standing and pushing. What was my emotion, my joy, my\r\n     exultation, when I espied among this humiliated mass, struggling\r\n     and buffeted--whom but Keate! Keate the master of our existence,\r\n     the tyrant of our days! Pure, unalloyed, unadulterated rapture!\r\n     Such a [Greek: peripeteia], such a reversal of human conditions of being,\r\n     as that now exhibited between the Eton lower boy uplifted to the\r\n     luxurious gallery pew, and the head-master of Eton, whom I was\r\n     accustomed to see in the roomy deck of the upper school with vacant\r\n     space and terror all around him, it must be hard for any one to\r\n     conceive, except the two who were the subjects of it. Never, never,\r\n     have I forgotten that moment.[32]\r\n\r\n     I will now, after the manner of novelists, ask my reader to effect\r\n     along with me, a transition of some eighteen years, and to witness\r\n     another, and if not a more complete yet a worthier, turning of the\r\n     tables. In the year 1841 there was a very special Eton dinner held\r\n     in Willis's Rooms to commemorate the fourth centenary of the\r\n     ancient school. Lord Morpeth, afterwards Lord Carlisle, was in the\r\n     chair. On his right, not far off him, was Dr. Keate, to whom I\r\n     chanced to have a seat almost immediately opposite. In those days,\r\n     at public dinners, cheering was marked by gradations. As the Queen\r\n     was suspected of sympathy with the liberal government of Lord\r\n     Melbourne which advised her, the toast of the sovereign was\r\n     naturally received with a moderate amount of acclamation, decently\r\n     and thriftily doled out. On the other hand the Queen Dowager either\r\n     was, or was believed to be, conservative; and her health\r\n     consequently figured as the toast of the evening, and drew forth,\r\n     as a matter of course, by far its loudest acclamation. So much was\r\n     routine; and we went through it as usual. But the real toast of the\r\n     evening was yet to come. I suppose it to be beyond doubt that of\r\n     the assembled company the vastly preponderating majority had been\r\n     under his sway at Eton; and if, when in that condition, any one of\r\n     them had been asked how he liked Dr. Keate, he would beyond\r\n     question have answered, 'Keate? Oh, I hate him.' It is equally\r\n     beyond doubt that to the persons of the whole of them, with the\r\n     rarest exceptions, it had been the ease of Dr. Keate to administer\r\n     the salutary correction of the birch. But upon this occasion, when\r\n     his name had been announced the scene was indescribable. Queen and\r\n     Queen Dowager alike vanished into insignificance. The roar of\r\n     cheering had a beginning, but never knew satiety or end. Like the\r\n     huge waves at Biarritz, the floods of cheering continually\r\n     recommenced; the whole process was such that we seemed all to have\r\n     lost our self-possession and to be hardly able to keep our seats.\r\n     When at length it became possible Keate rose: that is to say, his\r\n     head was projected slightly over the heads of his two neighbours.\r\n     He struggled to speak; I will not say I heard every syllable, for\r\n     there were no syllables; speak he could not. He tried in vain to\r\n     mumble a word or two, but wholly failed, recommenced the vain\r\n     struggle and sat down. It was certainly one of the most moving\r\n     spectacles that in my whole life I have witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                             AT WILMSLOW\r\n\r\nSome months passed between leaving Eton and going to Oxford. In January\r\n1828, Gladstone went to reside with Dr. Turner at Wilmslow in Cheshire,\r\nand remained there until Turner was made Bishop of Calcutta. The\r\nbishop's pupil afterwards testified to his amiability, refinement, and\r\ndevoutness; but the days of his energy were past, and 'the religious\r\ncondition of the parish was depressing.' Among the neighbouring\r\nfamilies, with whom he made acquaintance while at Wilmslow, were the\r\nGregs of Quarry Bank, a refined and philanthropic household, including\r\namong the sons William R. Greg (born in the same year as Mr. Gladstone),\r\nthat ingenious, urbane, interesting, and independent mind, whose\r\nspeculations, dissolvent and other, were afterwards to take an effective\r\nplace in the writings of the time. 'I fear he is a unitarian,' the young\r\nchurchman mentions to his father, and gives sundry reasons for that\r\nsombre apprehension; it was, indeed, only too well founded.\r\n\r\nWhile at Wilmslow (Feb. 5, 1828) Gladstone was taken to dine with the\r\nrector of Alderley--'an extremely gentlemanly and said to be a very\r\nclever man,'--afterwards to be known as the liberal and enlightened\r\nEdward Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, and father of Arthur Stanley, the\r\nfamous dean. Him, on this occasion, the young Gladstone seems to have\r\nseen for the first time. Arthur Stanley was six years his junior, and\r\nthere was then some idea of sending him to Eton. As it happened, he too\r\nwas a pupil at Rawson's at Seaforth, and in the summer after the\r\nmeeting at Alderley the two lads met again. The younger of them has\r\ndescribed how he was invited to breakfast with William Gladstone at\r\nSeaforth House; in what grand style they breakfasted, how he devoured\r\nstrawberries, swam the Newfoundland dog in the pond, looked at books and\r\npictures, and talked to W. Gladstone 'almost all the time about all\r\nsorts of things. He is so very good-natured, and I like him very much.\r\nHe talked a great deal about Eton, and said that it was a very good\r\nplace for those who liked boating and Latin verses. He was very\r\ngood-natured to us all the time, and lent me books to read when we went\r\naway.'[33] A few months later, as all the world knows, Stanley, happily\r\nfor himself and for all of us, went not to Eton but to Rugby, where\r\nArnold had just entered on his bold and noble task of changing the face\r\nof education in England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Gleanings_, vii. p. 138.\r\n\r\n[24] A story sometimes told of Provost Goodall.\r\n\r\n[25] At Marlborough, Feb. 3, 1877; at Mill Hill School, June 11, 1879.\r\n\r\n[26] Doyle tells a story of the boy being flogged for bringing wine into\r\nhis study. When questioned on this, Mr. Gladstone said, 'I _was_\r\nflogged, but not for anything connected in any way with wine, of which,\r\nby the by, my father supplied me with a small amount, and insisted upon\r\nmy drinking it, or some of it, all the time that I was at Eton. The\r\nreason why I was flogged was this. I was praepostor of the remove on a\r\ncertain day, and from kindness or good nature was induced to omit from\r\nthe list of boys against whom H. [the master] had complained, and who\r\nought to have been flogged next day, the names of three offenders. The\r\nthree boys in question got round me with a story that their friends were\r\ncoming down from London to see them, and that if they were put down on\r\nthe flogging list they could not meet their friends. Next day when I\r\nwent into school H. roared out in a voice of thunder, \"Gladstone, put\r\ndown your own name on the list of boys to be flogged.\"' Mr. Gladstone on\r\nthis occasion told another tale of this worthy's 'humour.' 'One day H.\r\ncalled out to the praepostor, \"Write down Hamilton's name to be flogged\r\nfor breaking my window.\" \"I never broke your window, sir,\" exclaimed\r\nHamilton. \"Praepostor,\" retorted H., \"write down Hamilton's name for\r\nbreaking my window and lying.\" \"Upon my soul, sir, I did not do it,\"\r\nejaculated the boy, with increased emphasis. \"Praepostor, write down\r\nHamilton's name for breaking my window, lying, and swearing.\" Against\r\nthis final sentence there was no appeal, and, accordingly, Hamilton was\r\nflogged (I believe unjustly) next day.'--F. Lawley in _Daily Telegraph_,\r\nMay 20, 1898.\r\n\r\n[27] _Temple Bar_, Feb. 1883.\r\n\r\n[28] Feb. 10, 1827.\r\n\r\n[29] Mr. Gladstone fixed on two of the elegies of _In Memoriam_ as most\r\ndirectly conveying the image of Arthur Hallam, cviii. and cxxviii.\r\n\r\n[30] _Iliad_, iii. 221.\r\n\r\n[31] _Ibid._ x. 242.\r\n\r\n[32] I have heard him tell this story, and Garrick himself could not\r\nhave reproduced a schoolboy's glee with more admirable accent and\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n[33] Prothero's _Life of Dean Stanley_, 1. p. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                                OXFORD\r\n\r\n                   (_October 1828-December 1831_)\r\n\r\n     Steeped in sentiment as she lies, spreading her gardens to the\r\n     moonlight, and whispering from her towers the last enchantments of\r\n     the Middle Age, who will deny that Oxford, by her ineffable charm,\r\n     keeps ever calling us nearer to the true goal of all of us, to the\r\n     ideal, to perfection--to beauty, in a word, which is only truth\r\n     seen from another side?--M. ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlorious to most are the days of life in a great school, but it is at\r\ncollege that aspiring talent first enters on its inheritance. Oxford was\r\nslowly awakening from a long age of lethargy. Toryism of a stolid\r\nclownish type still held the thrones of collegiate power. Yet the eye of\r\nan imaginative scholar as he gazed upon the grey walls, reared by piety,\r\nmunificence, and love of learning in a far-off time, might well discern\r\nbehind an unattractive screen of academic sloth, the venerable past, not\r\ndim and cold, but in its traditions rich, nourishing, and alive. Such an\r\none could see before him present days of honourable emulation and\r\nstirring acquisition--fit prelude of a man's part to play in a strenuous\r\nfuture. It is from Gladstone's introduction into this enchanted and\r\ninspiring world, that we recognise the beginning of the wonderful course\r\nthat was to show how great a thing the life of a man may be made.\r\n\r\n                           CHRIST CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Eton boy became the Christ Church man, and there began residence,\r\nOctober 10, 1828. Mr. Gladstone's rooms, during most of his\r\nundergraduate life, were on the right hand, and on the first floor of\r\nthe staircase on the right, as one enters by the Canterbury gate. He\r\ntells his mother that they are in a very fashionable part of the\r\ncollege, and mentions as a delightful fact, that Gaskell and Seymer\r\nhave rooms on the same floor. Samuel Smith was head until 1831, when he\r\nwas succeeded by the more celebrated Dr. Gaisford, always described by\r\nMr. Gladstone as a splendid scholar, but a bad dean. Gaisford's\r\nexcellent services to the Greek learning of his day are unquestioned,\r\nand he had the signal merit of speech, Spartan brevity. For a short time\r\nin 1806 he had been tutor to Peel. When Lord Liverpool offered him the\r\nGreek professorship, with profuse compliments on his erudition, the\r\nlearned man replied, 'My Lord, I have received your letter, and accede\r\nto the contents.--Yours, T. G.' And to the complaining parent of an\r\nundergraduate he wrote, 'Dear Sir,--Such letters as yours are a great\r\nannoyance to your obedient servant T. Gaisford.'[34] This laconic gift\r\nthe dean evidently had not time to transmit to all of his flock.\r\n\r\nChrist Church in those days was infested with some rowdyism, and in one\r\nbear-fight an undergraduate was actually killed. In the chapel the new\r\nundergraduate found little satisfaction, for the service was scarcely\r\nperformed with common decency. There seems, however, to have been no\r\nirreconcilable prejudice against reading, and in the schools the college\r\nwas at the top of its academic fame. The influence of Cyril Jackson, the\r\ndean in Peel's time, whose advice to Peel and, other pupils to work like\r\na tiger, and not to be afraid of killing one's self by work, was still\r\noperative.[35] At the summer examination of 1830, Christ Church won five\r\nfirst classes out of ten. Most commoners, according to a letter of\r\nGaskell's, had from three hundred and fifty to five hundred pounds a\r\nyear; but gentlemen commoners like Acland and Gaskell had from five to\r\nsix hundred. At the end of 1829, Mr. Gladstone received a studentship\r\n_honoris causa_, by nomination of the dean--a system that would not be\r\napproved in our epoch of competitive examination, but still an advance\r\nupon the time-honoured practice of deans and canons disposing of\r\nstudentships on grounds of private partiality without reference to\r\ndesert. We may assume that the dean was not indifferent to academic\r\npromise when he told Gladstone, very good-naturedly and civilly, that he\r\nhad determined to offer him his nomination. The student designate wrote\r\na theme, read it out before the chapter, passed a nominal, or even\r\nfarcical, examination in Homer and Virgil, was elected as matter of\r\ncourse by the chapter, and after chapel on the morning of Christmas eve,\r\nhaving taken several oaths, was formally admitted in the name of the\r\nHoly Trinity.\r\n\r\nMr. Biscoe, his classical tutor, was a successful lecturer on Aristotle,\r\nespecially on the Rhetoric. With Charles Wordsworth, son of the master\r\nof Trinity at Cambridge, and afterwards Bishop of Saint Andrews, he read\r\nfor scholarship, apparently not wholly to his own satisfaction. While\r\nstill an undergraduate, he writes to his father (Nov. 2, 1830), 'I am\r\nwretchedly deficient in the knowledge of modern languages, literature,\r\nand history; and the classical knowledge acquired here, though sound,\r\naccurate, and useful, yet is not such as to _complete_ an education.' It\r\nlooked, in truth, as if the caustic saying of a brilliant colleague of\r\nhis in later years were not at the time unjust, as now it would happily\r\nbe, that it was a battle between Eton and education, and Eton had won.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone never to the end of his days ceased to be grateful that\r\nOxford was chosen for his university. At Cambridge, as he said in\r\ndiscussing Hallam's choice, the pure refinements of scholarship were\r\nmore in fashion than the study of the great masterpieces of antiquity in\r\ntheir substance and spirit. The classical examination at Oxford, on the\r\nother hand, was divided into the three elastic departments of\r\nscholarship and poetry, history, and philosophy. In this list, history\r\nsomewhat outweighed the scholarship, and philosophy was somewhat more\r\nregarded than history. In each case the examination turned more on\r\ncontents than on form, and the influence of Butler was at its climax.\r\n\r\n                    CHARACTER OF OXFORD TEACHING\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Gladstone had gone to Oxford ten years earlier, he would have\r\nfound the Ethics and the Rhetoric treated, only much less effectively,\r\nin the Cambridge method, like dramatists and orators, as pieces of\r\nliterature. As it was, Whately's common sense had set a new fashion, and\r\nAristotle was studied as the master of those who know how to teach us\r\nthe right way about the real world.[36] Aristotle, Butler, and logic\r\nwere the new acquisitions, but in none of the three as yet did the\r\nteaching go deep compared with modern standards. Oxford scholars of our\r\nown day question whether there was even one single tutor in 1830, with\r\nthe possible exception of Hampden, who could expound Aristotle as a\r\nwhole--so utterly had the Oxford tradition perished.[37]\r\n\r\nThe time was in truth the eve of an epoch of illumination, and in these\r\nepochs it is not old academic systems that the new light is wont to\r\nstrike with its first rays. The summer of 1831 is the date of Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton's memorable exposure,[38] in his most trenchant and\r\nterrifying style and with a learning all his own, of the corruption and\r\n'vampire oppression of Oxford'; its sacrifice of the public interests to\r\nprivate advantage; its unhallowed disregard of every moral and religious\r\nbond; the systematic perjury so naturalised in a great seminary of\r\nreligious education; the apathy with which the injustice was tolerated\r\nby the state and the impiety tolerated by the church. Copleston made a\r\nwretched reply, but more than twenty years passed before the spirit of\r\nreform overthrew the entrenchments of academic abuse. In that overthrow,\r\nwhen the time came, Mr. Gladstone was called to play a part, though\r\nhardly at first a very zealous one. This was not for a quarter of a\r\ncentury; for, as we shall soon see, both the revival of learning and the\r\nreform of institutions at Oxford were sharply turned aside from their\r\nexpected course by the startling theological movement that now proceeded\r\nfrom her venerable walls.\r\n\r\nWhat interests us here is not the system but the man; and never was\r\nvital temperament more admirably fitted by its vigour, sincerity,\r\nconscience, compass, for whatever good seed from the hand of any sower\r\nmight be cast upon it. In an entry in his diary in the usual strain of\r\nevangelical devotion (April 25, 1830) is a sentence that reveals what\r\nwas in Mr. Gladstone the nourishing principle of growth: 'In practice\r\nthe great end is that the love of God may become the _habit_ of my soul,\r\nand particularly these things are to be sought;--1. The spirit of love.\r\n2. Of self-sacrifice. 3. Of purity. 4. Of energy.' Just as truly as if\r\nwe were recalling some hero of the seventeenth or any earlier century,\r\nis this the biographic clue.\r\n\r\nGladstone constantly reproaches himself for natural indolence, and for a\r\nyear and a half he took his college course pretty easily. Then he\r\nchanged. 'The time for half-measures and trifling and pottering, in\r\nwhich I have so long indulged myself, is now gone by, and I must do or\r\ndie.' His really hard work did not begin until the summer of 1830, when\r\nhe returned to Cuddesdon to read mathematics with Saunders, a man who\r\nhad the reputation of being singularly able and stimulating to his\r\npupils, and with whom he had done some rudiments before going into\r\nresidence at Christ Church. In his description of this gentleman to his\r\nfather, we may hear for the first time the redundant roll that was for\r\nmany long years to be so familiar and so famous. Saunders' disposition,\r\nit appears, 'is one certainly of extreme benevolence, and of a\r\nbenevolence which is by no means less strong and full when purely\r\ngratuitous and spontaneous, than when he seems to be under the tie of\r\nsome definite and positive obligation.' Dr. Gaisford would perhaps have\r\nput it that the tutor was no kinder where his kindness was paid for,\r\nthan where it was not.\r\n\r\n                       CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nThe catholic question, that was helping many another and older thing to\r\ndivide England from Ireland, after having for a whole generation played\r\nhavoc with the fortunes of party and the careers of statesmen, was now\r\ndrawing swiftly to its close. The Christ Church student had a glimpse of\r\none of the opening scenes of the last act. He writes to his brother\r\n(Feb. 6th, 1829):--\r\n\r\n     I saw yesterday a most interesting scene in the Convocation house.\r\n     The occasion was the debate on the anti-catholic petition, which it\r\n     has long been the practice of the university to send up year by\r\n     year. This time it was worded in the most gentle and moderate terms\r\n     possible. All the ordinary business there, is transacted in Latin;\r\n     I mean such things as putting the question, speaking, etc., and\r\n     this rule, I assure you, stops many a mouth, and I dare say saves\r\n     the Roman catholics many a hard word. There were rather above two\r\n     hundred doctors and masters of arts present. Three speeches were\r\n     made, two against and one in favour of sending up the petition.\r\n     Instead of aye and no they had _placet_ and _non-placet_, and in\r\n     place of a member dividing the House, the question was, \"_Petitne\r\n     aliquis scrutinium?_\" which was answered by \"_Peto!_\" \"_Peto!_\"\r\n     from many quarters. However, when the scrutiny took place, it was\r\n     found that the petition was carried by 156 to 48.... After the\r\n     division, however, came the most interesting part of the whole. A\r\n     letter from Peel, resigning the seat for the university, was read\r\n     before the assembly. It was addressed to the vice-chancellor and\r\n     had arrived just before, it was understood; and I suppose brought\r\n     hither the first positive and indubitable announcement of the\r\n     government's intention to emancipate the catholics.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Peel accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, and after some\r\ndeliberation allowed himself to be again brought forward for\r\nre-election. He was beaten by 755 votes to 609. The relics of the\r\ncontest, the figures and the inscriptions on the walls, soon\r\ndisappeared, but panic did not abate. On Gladstone's way to Oxford\r\n(April 30, 1829), a farmer's wife got into the coach, and in\r\ncommunicative vein informed him how frightened they had all been about\r\ncatholic emancipation, but she did not see that so much had come of it\r\nas yet. The college scout declared himself much troubled for the king's\r\nconscience, observing that if we make an oath at baptism, we ought to\r\nhold by it. 'The bed-makers,' Gladstone writes home, 'seem to continue\r\nin a great fright, and mine was asking me this morning whether it would\r\nnot be a very good thing if we were to give them [the Irish] a king and\r\na parliament of their own, and so to have no more to do with them. The\r\nold egg-woman is no whit easier, and wonders how Mr. Peel, who was\r\nalways such a well-behaved man here, can be so foolish as to think of\r\nletting in the Roman catholics.' The unthinking and the ignorant of all\r\nclasses were much alike. Arthur Hallam went to see _King John_ in 1827,\r\nand he tells his friend how the lines about the Italian priest (Act III.\r\nSc. 1) provoked rounds of clapping, while a gentleman in the next box\r\ncried out at the top of his voice, 'Bravo! Bravo! No Pope!' The same\r\ncorrespondent told Gladstone of the father of a common Eton friend, who\r\nhad challenged him with the overwhelming question, 'Could I say that any\r\npapist had ever at any time done any good to the world?' A still\r\nstormier conflict than even the emancipation of the catholics was now to\r\nshake Oxford and the country to the depths, before Mr. Gladstone took\r\nhis degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                           OXFORD FRIENDSHIPS\r\n\r\nHis friendships at Oxford Mr. Gladstone did not consider to have been as\r\na rule very intimate. Principal among them were Frederick Rogers, long\r\nafterwards Lord Blachford; Doyle; Gaskell; Bruce, afterwards Lord Elgin;\r\nCharles Canning, afterwards Lord Canning; the two Denisons; Lord\r\nLincoln. These had all been his friends at Eton. Among new acquisitions\r\nto the circle of his intimates at one time or another of his Oxford\r\nlife, were the two Aclands, Thomas and Arthur; Hamilton, afterwards\r\nBishop of Salisbury; Phillimore, destined to close and life-long\r\nfriendship; F. D. Maurice, then of Exeter College, a name destined to\r\nstir so many minds in the coming generation. Of Maurice, Arthur Hallam\r\nhad written to Gladstone (June 1830) exhorting him to cultivate his\r\nacquaintance. 'I know many,' says Hallam, 'whom Maurice has moulded like\r\na second nature, and these too, men eminent for intellectual power, to\r\nwhom the presence of a commanding spirit would in all other cases be a\r\nsignal rather for rivalry than reverential acknowledgment.' 'I knew\r\nMaurice well,' says Mr. Gladstone in one of his notes of reminiscence,\r\n'had heard superlative accounts of him from Cambridge, and really strove\r\nhard to make them all realities to myself. One Sunday morning we walked\r\nto Marsh Baldon to hear Mr. Porter, the incumbent, a calvinist\r\nindependent of the _clique_, and a man of remarkable power as we both\r\nthought. I think he and other friends did me good, but I got little\r\nsolid meat from him, as I found him difficult to catch and still more\r\ndifficult to hold.'\r\n\r\nSidney Herbert, afterwards so dear to him, now at Oriel, here first\r\nbecame an acquaintance. Manning, though they both read with the same\r\ntutor, and one succeeded the other as president of the Union, he did not\r\nat this time know well. The lists of his guests at wines and breakfasts\r\ndo not even contain the name of James Hope; indeed, Mr. Gladstone tells\r\nus that he certainly was not more than an acquaintance. In the account\r\nof intimates is the unexpected name of Tupper, who, in days to come,\r\nacquired for a time a grander reputation than he deserved by his\r\n_Proverbial Philosophy_, and on whom the public by and by avenged its\r\nown foolishness by severer doses of mockery than he had earned.[39] The\r\nfriend who seems most to have affected him in the deepest things was\r\nAnstice, whom he describes to his father (June 4, 1830) as 'a very\r\nclever man, and more than a clever man, a man of excellent principle and\r\nof perfect self-command, and of great industry. If any circumstances\r\ncould confer upon me the inestimable blessing of fixed habits and\r\nunremitting industry, these [the example of such a man] will be they.'\r\nThe diary tells how, in August (1830), Mr. Gladstone conversed with\r\nAnstice in a walk from Oxford to Cuddesdon on subjects of the highest\r\nimportance. 'Thoughts then first sprang up in my soul (obvious as they\r\nmay appear to many) which may powerfully influence my destiny. O for a\r\nlight from on high! I have no power, none, to discern the right path for\r\nmyself.' They afterwards had long talks together, 'about that awful\r\nsubject which has lately almost engrossed my mind.' Another\r\nday--'Conversation of an hour and a half with Anstice on practical\r\nreligion, particularly as regards our own situation. I bless and praise\r\nGod for his presence here.' 'Long talk with Anstice; would I were more\r\nworthy to be his companion.' 'Conversation with Anstice; he talked much\r\nwith Saunders on the motive of actions, contending for the love of God,\r\n_not_ selfishness even in its most refined form.'[40]\r\n\r\n                      EVANGELICAL IN RELIGION\r\n\r\nIn the matter of his own school of religion, Mr. Gladstone was always\r\ncertain that Oxford in his undergraduate days had no part in turning him\r\nfrom an evangelical into a high churchman. The tone and dialect of his\r\ndiary and letters at the time show how just this impression was. We find\r\nhim in 1830 expressing his satisfaction that a number of Hannah More's\r\ntracts have been put on the list of the Christian Knowledge Society. In\r\n1831 he bitterly deplores such ecclesiastical appointments as those of\r\nSydney Smith and Dr. Maltby, 'both of them, I believe, regular\r\nlatitudinarians.' He remembered his shock at Butler's laudation of\r\nNature. He was scandalised by a sermon in which Calvin was placed upon\r\nthe same level among heresiarchs as Socinus and other like aliens from\r\ngospel truth. He was delighted (March 1830) with a university sermon\r\nagainst Milman's _History of the Jews_, and hopes it may be useful as an\r\nantidote, 'for Milman, though I do think without intentions directly\r\nevil, does go far enough to be justly called a bane. For instance, he\r\nsays that had Moses never existed, the Hebrew nation would have remained\r\na degraded pariah tribe or been lost in the mass of the Egyptian\r\npopulation--and this notwithstanding the promise.' In all his letters in\r\nthe period from Eton to the end of Oxford and later, a language noble\r\nand exalted even in these youthful days is not seldom copiously streaked\r\nwith a vein that, to eyes not trained to evangelical light and to minds\r\nnot tolerant of the expansion that comes to religious natures in the\r\ndays of adolescence, may seem unpleasantly strained and excessive. The\r\nfashion of such words undergoes transfiguration as the epochs pass. Yet\r\nin all their fashions, even the crudest, they deserve much tenderness.\r\nHe consults a clergyman (1829) on the practice of prayer meetings in\r\nhis rooms. His correspondent answers, that as the wicked have their\r\norgies and meet to gamble and to drink, so they that fear the Lord\r\nshould speak often to one another concerning Him; that prayer meetings\r\nare not for the cultivation or exhibition of gifts, nor to enable noisy\r\nand forward young men to pose as leaders of a school of prophets; but if\r\na few young men of like tastes feel the withering influence of mere\r\nscholastic learning, and the necessity of mutual stimulation and\r\nrefreshment, then such prayer meetings would be a safe and natural\r\nremedy. The student's attention to all religious observances was close\r\nand unbroken, the most living part of his existence.\r\n\r\nThe movement that was to convulse the church had not yet begun. 'You may\r\nsmile,' Mr. Gladstone said long after, 'when told that when I was at\r\nOxford, Dr. Hampden was regarded as a model of orthodoxy; that Dr.\r\nNewman was eyed with suspicion as a low churchman, and Dr. Pusey as\r\nleaning to rationalism.' What Mr. Gladstone afterwards described as a\r\nsteady, clear, but dry anglican orthodoxy bore sway, 'and frowned this\r\nway or that, on the first indication of any tendency to diverge from the\r\nbeaten path.'[41] He hears Whately preach a controversial sermon (1831)\r\njust after he had been made Archbishop of Dublin. 'Doubtless he is a man\r\nof much power and many excellences, but his anti-sabbatical doctrine is,\r\nI fear, as mischievous as it is unsound.' A sermon of Keble's at St.\r\nMary's prompts the uneasy question, 'Are all Mr. Keble's opinions those\r\nof scripture and the church? Of his life and heart and practice, none\r\ncould doubt, all would admire.' A good sermon is mentioned from Blanco\r\nWhite, that strange and forlorn figure of whom in later life Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote an interesting account, not conclusive in argument, but\r\nassuredly not wanting in either delicacy or generosity.[42] 'Dr. Pusey\r\nwas very kind to me when I was an undergraduate at Oxford,' he says, but\r\nwhat their relations were I know not. 'I knew and respected both Bishop\r\nLloyd and Dr. Pusey,' he says, 'but neither of them attempted to\r\nexercise the smallest influence over my religious opinions.' With Newman\r\nhe seems to have been brought into contact hardly at all.[43] Newman\r\nand one of the Wilberforces came to dine at Cuddesdon one day, and, on a\r\nlater occasion, he and another fellow of Oriel were at a dinner with Mr.\r\nGladstone at the table of his friend Philip Pusey. Two or three of his\r\nsermons are mentioned. One of them (March 7, 1831) contained 'much\r\nsingular, not to say objectionable matter, if one may so speak of so\r\ngood a man.' Of another,--'heard Newman preach a good sermon on those\r\nwho made excuse' (Sept. 25, 1831). Of the generality of university\r\nsermons, he accepted the observation of his friend Anstice,--'Depend\r\nupon it, such sermons as those can never convert a single person.' On\r\nsome Sundays he hears two of these discourses in the morning and\r\nafternoon, and a third sermon in the evening, for though he became the\r\nmost copious of all speakers, Mr. Gladstone was ever the most generous\r\nof listeners. It was at St. Ebb's that he found really congenial\r\nministrations--an ecclesiastical centre described by him fifty years\r\nlater--under Mr. Bulteel, a man of some note in his day; here the flame\r\nwas at white heat, and a score or two of young men felt its\r\nattractions.[44] He always remembered among the wonderful sights of his\r\nlife, St. Mary's 'crammed in all parts by all orders, when Mr. Bulteel,\r\nan outlying calvinist, preached his accusatory sermon (some of it too\r\ntrue) against the university.' In the summer of 1830, Mr. Gladstone\r\nnotes, 'Poor Bulteel has lost his church for preaching in the open air.\r\nPity that he should have acted so, and pity that it should be found\r\nnecessary to make such an example of a man of God.' The preacher was\r\nimpenitent, for from a window Mr. Gladstone again heard him conduct a\r\nservice for a large congregation who listened attentively to a sermon\r\nthat was interesting, but evinced some soreness of spirit. A 'most\r\npainful' discourse from a Mr. Crowther so moves Mr. Gladstone that he\r\nsits down to write to the preacher, 'earnestly expostulating with him on\r\nthe character and the doctrines of the sermon,' and after re-writing his\r\nletter, he delivers it with his own hand at the door of the displeasing\r\ndivine. The effect was not other than salutary, for a little later he\r\nwas 'happy to hear two sermons of good principles from Mr. Crowther.' To\r\nhis father, October 27, 1830:--'Dr. Chalmers has been passing through\r\nOxford, and I went to hear him preach on Sunday evening, though it was\r\nat the baptist chapel.... I need hardly say that his sermon was\r\nadmirable, and quite as remarkable for the judicious and sober manner in\r\nwhich he enforced his views, as for their lofty principles and piety. He\r\npreached, I think, for an hour and forty minutes.' The admiration thus\r\nfirst aroused only grew with fuller knowledge in the coming years.\r\n\r\n                             ESSAY CLUB\r\n\r\nAn Essay Club, called from its founder's initials the WEG, was formed at\r\na meeting in Gaskell's rooms in October, 1829. Only two members out of\r\nthe first twelve did not belong to Christ Church, Rogers of Oriel and\r\nMoncreiff of New.[45] The Essay Club's transactions, though not very\r\nserious, deserve a glance. Mr. Gladstone reads an essay (Feb. 20, 1830)\r\non the comparative rank of poetry and philosophy, concluding with a\r\nmotion that the rank of philosophy is higher than that of poetry: it was\r\nbeaten by seven to five. Without a division, they determined that\r\nEnglish poetry is of a higher order than Greek. The truth of the\r\nprinciples of phrenology was affirmed with the tremendous emphasis of\r\neleven to one. Though trifling in degree, the influence of the modern\r\ndrama was pronounced in quality pernicious. Gladstone gave his casting\r\nvote against the capacious proposition, of which philosophers had made\r\nso much in France, Switzerland, and other places on the eve of the\r\nFrench revolution, that education and other outward circumstances have\r\nmore than nature to do with man's disposition. By four to three, Mr.\r\nTennyson's poems were affirmed to show considerable genius, Gladstone\r\nhappily in the too slender majority. The motion that 'political liberty\r\nis not to be considered as the end of government' was a great affair.\r\nMaurice, who had been admitted to the club on coming to Oxford from\r\nCambridge, moved an amendment 'that every man has a right to perform\r\ncertain personal duties with which no system of government has a right\r\nto interfere.' Gladstone 'objected to an observation that had fallen\r\nfrom the mover, \"A man finds himself in the world,\" as if he did not\r\ncome into the world under a debt to his parents, under obligations to\r\nsociety.' The tame motion of Lord Abercorn, that Elizabeth's conduct to\r\nMary Queen of Scots was unjustifiable and impolitic, was stiffened into\r\n'not only unjustifiable and impolitic, but a base and treacherous\r\nmurder,' and in that severe form was carried without a division.\r\n\r\nPlenty of nonsense was talked we may be sure, and so there was, no\r\ndoubt, in the Olive Grove of Academe or amid those surnamed Peripatetics\r\nand the Sect Epicurean. Yet nonsense notwithstanding, the Essay Club had\r\nmembers who proved in time to have superior minds if ever men had, and\r\ntheir disputations in one another's rooms helped to sharpen their mental\r\napparatus, to start trains of ideas however immature, and to shake the\r\ncherished dogmatisms brought from beloved homes, even if dogmatism as\r\nstringent took their place. This is how the world moves, and Oxford was\r\njust beginning to rub its eyes, awaking to the speculations of a new\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked back in after times, Mr. Gladstone traced one great\r\ndefect in the education of Oxford. 'Perhaps it was my own fault, but I\r\nmust admit that I did not learn when I was at Oxford that which I have\r\nlearned since--namely, to set a due value on the imperishable and\r\ninestimable principle of British liberty. The temper which too much\r\nprevailed in academical circles was that liberty was regarded with\r\njealousy and fear, something which could not wholly be dispensed with,\r\nbut which was to be continually watched for fear of excesses.'[46]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n                  TRIES FOR THE IRELAND SCHOLARSHIP\r\n\r\nIn March 1830 Gladstone made the first of two attempts to win the\r\nscholarship newly founded by Dean Ireland, and from the beginning one of\r\nthe most coveted of university prizes. In 1830 (March 16) he\r\nwrote:--'There is it appears smaller chance than ever of its falling out\r\nof the hands of the Shrewsbury people. There is a very formidable one\r\nindeed, by name Scott, come up from Christ Church. If it is to go among\r\nthem I hope he may get it.' This was Robert Scott, afterwards master of\r\nBalliol, and then dean of Rochester, and the coadjutor with Dean Liddell\r\nin the famous Greek Lexicon brought out in 1843. A year later he tried\r\nagain, but little better success came either to himself or to Scott. He\r\ntells his father the story (March 16th, 1831) and collegians who have\r\nfought such battles may care to hear it:--\r\n\r\n     I must first tell you that I am _not_ the successful candidate, and\r\n     after this I shall have nothing to communicate but what will, I\r\n     think, give you pleasure. The scholarship has been won by (I\r\n     believe) a native of Liverpool.[47] His name is Brancker, and he is\r\n     now actually at Shrewsbury, but had matriculated here though he had\r\n     not come up to reside. This result has excited immense surprise.\r\n     For my own part, I went into the examination _solely_ depending for\r\n     any hope of pre-eminence above the Shrewsbury men on three points,\r\n     Greek history, one particular kind of Greek verses, and Greek\r\n     philosophy.... It so fell out, however, that not one of these three\r\n     points was brought to bear on the examination, though, indeed, it\r\n     is but a lame one without them. Accordingly from the turn it seemed\r\n     to take as it proceeded, my own expectations regularly declined,\r\n     and I thought I might consider myself very well off if I came in\r\n     pretty high. As it is, I am even with the great competitor, Scott,\r\n     whom everybody almost thought the favourite candidate, and above\r\n     the others. Allies, an Eton man, Scott and I are placed together;\r\n     and Short, one of the examiners, told us this morning that it was\r\n     an extremely near thing, and he had great difficulty in making up\r\n     his mind, which he never had felt in any former examination in\r\n     which he had been engaged; and indeed he laid the preference given\r\n     to Brancker chiefly on his having written short and concise\r\n     answers, while ours were longwinded. And in consideration of its\r\n     having been so closely contested, the vice-chancellor is to present\r\n     each of us with a set of books.... Something however may fairly\r\n     enough be attributed to the fact that at Eton we were not educated\r\n     for such objects as these.... The result will affect the\r\n     scholarship itself more than any individual character; for previous\r\n     events have created, and this has contributed amazingly to\r\n     strengthen, a prevalent impression that the Shrewsbury system is\r\n     radically a false one, and that its object is not to educate the\r\n     mind but merely to cram and stuff it for these purposes. However,\r\n     we who are beaten are not fair judges.... I only trust that you\r\n     will not be more annoyed than I am by this event.\r\n\r\nBrancker was said to have won because he answered all the questions not\r\nonly shortly, but most of them right, and Mr. Gladstone's essay was\r\nmarked 'desultory beyond belief.' Below Allies came Sidney Herbert, then\r\nat Oriel, and Grove, afterwards a judge and an important name in the\r\nhistory of scientific speculation.\r\n\r\nHe was equally unsuccessful in another field of competition. He sent in\r\na poem on Richard Coeur de Lion for the Newdigate prize in 1829. In 1893\r\nsomebody asked his leave to reprint it, and at Mr. Gladstone's request\r\nsent him a copy:--\r\n\r\n     On perusing it I was very much struck by the contrast it exhibited\r\n     between the faculty of versification which (I thought) was good,\r\n     and the faculty of poetry, which was very defective. This faculty\r\n     of verse had been trained I suppose by verse-making at Eton, and\r\n     was based upon the possession of a good or tolerable ear with which\r\n     nature had endowed me. I think that a poetical faculty did develop\r\n     itself in me a little later, that is to say between twenty and\r\n     thirty, due perhaps to having read Dante with a real devotion and\r\n     absorption. It was, however, in my view, true but weak, and has\r\n     never got beyond that stage. It was evidently absent from the\r\n     verses, I will not say the poem, on Coeur de Lion; and without\r\n     hesitation I declined to allow any reprint.[48]\r\n\r\n                          DEBATES AT THE UNION\r\n\r\nHe was active in the debates at the Union, where he made his first start\r\nin the speaking line (Feb. 1830) in a strong oration much admired by his\r\nfriends, in favour,--of all the questionable things in the world,--of\r\nthe Treason and Sedition Acts of 1795. He writes home that he did not\r\nfind the ordeal so formidable as it used to be before the smaller\r\naudiences at Eton, for at Oxford they sometimes mustered as many as a\r\nhundred or a hundred and fifty. He spoke for a strongly-worded motion on\r\na happier theme, in favour of the policy and memory of Canning. In the\r\nsummer of 1831, he mentions a debate in which a motion was proposed in\r\nfavour of speedy emancipation of the West Indian slaves. 'I moved an\r\namendment that education of a religious kind was the fit object of\r\nlegislation, which was carried by thirty-three to twelve.' Of the most\r\nnotable of all his successes at the Union we shall soon hear.\r\n\r\n                              DAILY LIFE\r\n\r\nHis little diary, written for no eye but his own, and in the use of\r\nwhich I must beware of the sin of violating the sanctuary, contains in\r\nthe most concise of daily records all his various activities, and, at\r\nleast after the summer at Cuddesdon, it presents an attractive picture\r\nof duty, industry, and attention, 'constant as the motion of the day.'\r\nThe entries are much alike, and a few of them will suffice to bring his\r\nlife and him before us. The days for 1830 may almost be taken at random.\r\n\r\n     _May 10, 1830._--Prospectively, I have the following work to do in\r\n     the course of this term.

It is\r\n     indeed true [the death of Huskisson], and he, poor man, was in his\r\n     last agonies when I was playing cards on Wednesday night. When\r\n     shall we learn wisdom? Not that I see folly in the fact of playing\r\n     cards, but it is too often accompanied by a dissipated spirit.\r\n\r\nHe did not escape the usual sensations of the desultory when fate forces\r\nthem to wear the collar. 'In fact, at times I find it very irksome, and\r\nmy having the inclination to view it in that light is to me the surest\r\ndemonstration that my mind was in great want of some discipline, and\r\nsome regular exertion, for hitherto I have read by fits and starts and\r\njust as it pleased me. I hope that this vacation [summer of 1830] will\r\nconfer on me one benefit more important than any having reference merely\r\nto my class--I mean the habit of steady application and strict economy\r\nof time.'\r\n\r\n                      CORRESPONDENCE WITH HALLAM\r\n\r\nAmong the recorded fragmentary items of 1830, by the way, he read Mill's\r\ncelebrated essay on Coleridge, which, when it was republished a\r\ngeneration later along with the companion essay on Bentham, made so\r\nstrong an impression on the Oxford of my day. He kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with Hallam, now at Cambridge, and an extract from one of\r\nHallam's letters may show something of the writer, as of the friend for\r\nwhose sympathising mind it was intended:--\r\n\r\n     Academical honours would be less than nothing to me were it not for\r\n     my father's wishes, and even these are moderate on the subject. If\r\n     it please God that I make the name I bear honoured in a second\r\n     generation, it will be by inward power which is its own reward; if\r\n     it please Him not, I hope to go down to the grave unrepining, for I\r\n     have lived and loved and been loved; and what will be the momentary\r\n     pangs of an atomic existence when the scheme of that providential\r\n     love which pervades, sustains, quickens this boundless universe\r\n     shall at the last day be unfolded and adored? The great truth\r\n     which, when we are rightly impressed with it, will liberate mankind\r\n     is that no man has a right to isolate himself, because every man is\r\n     a particle of a marvellous whole; that when he suffers, since it is\r\n     for the good of that whole, he, the particle, has no right to\r\n     complain; and in the long run, that which is the good of all will\r\n     abundantly manifest itself to be the good of each. Other belief\r\n     consists not with theism. This is its centre. Let me quote to their\r\n     purpose the words of my favourite poet; it will do us good to hear\r\n     his voice, though but for a moment:--\r\n\r\n                     'One adequate support\r\n       For the calamities of mortal life\r\n       Exists--one only: an assured belief\r\n       That the procession of our fate, howe'er\r\n       Sad or disturbed, is ordered by a Being\r\n       Of infinite benevolence and power,\r\n       Whose everlasting purposes embrace\r\n       All accidents, converting them to good.'[49]\r\n\r\nHallam's father, in that memoir so just and tender which, he prefixes to\r\nhis son's literary remains, remarks that all his son's talk about this\r\nold desperate riddle of the origin and significance of evil, like the\r\ntalk of Leibnitz about it, resolved itself into an unproved assumption\r\nof the necessity of evil. In truth there is little sign that either\r\nArthur Hallam or Gladstone had in him the making of the patient and\r\nmethodical thinker in the high abstract sphere. They were both of them\r\ncast in another mould. But the efficacy of human relationships springs\r\nfrom a thousand subtler and more mysterious sources than either patience\r\nor method in our thinking. Such marked efficacy was there in the\r\nfriendship of these two, both of them living under pure skies, but one\r\nof the pair endowed besides with 'the thews that throw the world.'\r\n\r\nWhether in Gladstone's diary or in his letters, in the midst of\r\nHerodotus and Butler and Aristotle and the rest of the time-worn sages,\r\nwe are curiously conscious of the presence of a spirit of action,\r\naffairs, excitement. It is not the born scholar eager in search of\r\nknowledge for its own sake; there is little of Milton's 'quiet air of\r\ndelightful studies;' and none of Pascal's 'labouring for truth with\r\nmany a heavy sigh.' The end of it all is, as Aristotle said it should\r\nbe, not knowing but doing:--honourable desire of success, satisfaction\r\nof the hopes of friends, a general literary appetite, conscious\r\npreparation for private and public duty in the world, a steady\r\nprogression out of the shallows into the depths, a gaze beyond garden\r\nand cloister, _in agmen, in pulverem, in clamorem_, to the dust and\r\nburning sun and shouting of the days of conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nIn September 1829, as we have seen, Huskisson had disappeared. Thomas\r\nGladstone was in the train drawn by the _Dart_ that ran over the\r\nstatesman and killed him.\r\n\r\n     Poor Huskisson, he writes to William Gladstone, the great promoter\r\n     of the railroad, has fallen a victim to its opening!... As soon as\r\n     I heard that Huskisson had been run over, I ran and found him on\r\n     the ground close to the duke's [Wellington] car, his legs\r\n     apparently both broken (though only one was), the ground covered\r\n     with blood, his eyes open, but death written in his face. When they\r\n     raised him a little he said, 'Leave me, let me die.' 'God forgive\r\n     me, I am a dead man.' 'I can never stand this.'... On Tuesday he\r\n     made a speech in the Exchange reading room, when he said he hoped\r\n     long to represent them. He said, too, that day, that we were sure\r\n     of a fine day, for the duke would have his old luck. Talked\r\n     jokingly, too, of insuring his life for the ride.\r\n\r\nAnd he notes, as others did, the extraordinary circumstance that of half\r\na million of people on the line of road the victim should be the duke's\r\ngreat opponent, thus carried off suddenly before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was some question of Mr. John Gladstone taking Huskisson's place\r\nas one of the members for Liverpool, but he did not covet it. He foresaw\r\ntoo many local jealousies, his deafness would be sadly against him, he\r\nwas nearly sixty-five, and he felt himself too old to face the turmoil.\r\nHe looked upon the Wellington government as the only government\r\npossible, though as a friend of Canning he freely recognised its\r\ndefects, the self-will of the duke, and the parcel of mediocrities and\r\ndrones with whom, excepting Peel, he had filled his cabinet. His view of\r\nthe state of parties in the autumn of 1830 is clear and succinct enough\r\nto deserve reproduction. 'Huskisson's death,' he writes to his son at\r\nChrist Church (October 29, 1830), 'was a great gain to the duke, for he\r\nwas the most formidable thorn to prick him in the parliament. Of those\r\nwho acted with Huskisson, none have knowledge or experience sufficient\r\nto enable them to do so. As for the whigs, they can all talk and make\r\nspeeches, but they are not men of business. The ultra-tories are too\r\ncontemptible and wanting in talent to be thought of. The radicals cannot\r\nbe trusted, for they would soon pull down the venerable fabric of our\r\nconstitution. The liberals or independents must at least generally side\r\nwith the duke; they are likely to meet each other half way.'\r\n\r\n                           THE REFORM BILL\r\n\r\nIn less than a week after this acute survey the duke made his stalwart\r\ndeclaration in the House of Lords against all parliamentary reform. 'I\r\nhave not said too much, have I?' he asked of Lord Aberdeen on sitting\r\ndown. 'You'll hear of it,' was Aberdeen's reply. 'You've announced the\r\nfall of your government, that's all,' said another. In a fortnight\r\n(November 18) the duke was out, Lord Grey was in, and the country was\r\ngradually plunged into a determined struggle for the amendment of its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, as a resolute Canningite, was as fiercely hostile to the\r\nsecond and mightier innovation as he had been eager for the relief of\r\nthe catholics, and it was in connection with the Reform bill that he\r\nfirst made a public mark. The reader will recall the stages of that\r\nevent; how the bill was read a second time in the Commons by a majority\r\nof one on March 22nd, 1831; how, after a defeat by a majority of eight\r\non a motion of going into committee, Lord Grey dissolved; how the\r\ncountry, shaken to its depths, gave the reformers such undreamed of\r\nstrength, that on July 8th the second reading of the bill was carried by\r\na hundred and thirty-six; how on October 8th the Lords rejected it by\r\nforty-one, and what violent commotions that deed provoked; how a third\r\nbill was brought in (December 12th, 1831) and passed through the\r\nCommons (March 23rd, 1832); how the Lords were still refractory; what a\r\nlacerating ministerial crisis ensued; and how at last, in June, the\r\nbill, which was to work the miracle of a millennium, actually became the\r\nlaw of the land. Not even the pressure of preparation for the coming\r\nordeal of the examination schools could restrain the activity and zeal\r\nof our Oxonian. Canning had denounced parliamentary reform at Liverpool\r\nin 1820; and afterwards had declared in the House of Commons that if\r\nanybody asked him what he meant to do on the subject, he would oppose\r\nreform to the end of his life, under whatever shape it might appear.\r\nCanning's disciple at Christ Church was as vehement as the master.[50]\r\nTo a friend he wrote in 1865:--\r\n\r\n     I think that Oxford teaching had in our day an anti-popular\r\n     tendency. I must add that it was not owing to the books, but rather\r\n     to the way in which they were handled: and further, that it tended\r\n     still more strongly in my opinion to make the love of truth\r\n     paramount over all other motives in the mind, and thus that it\r\n     supplied an antidote for whatever it had of bane. The Reform bill\r\n     frightened me in 1831, and drove me off my natural and previous\r\n     bias. Burke and Canning misled many on that subject, and they\r\n     misled me.\r\n\r\nWhile staying at Leamington, whither his family constantly went in order\r\nto be under the medical care of the famous Jephson, Mr. Gladstone went\r\nto a reform meeting at Warwick, of which he wrote a contemptuous account\r\nin a letter to the _Standard_ (April 7). The gentry present were few,\r\nthe nobility none, the clergy one only, while 'the mob beneath the grand\r\nstand was Athenian in its levity, in its recklessness, in its gaping\r\nexpectancy, in its self-love and self-conceit--in everything but its\r\nacuteness.' 'If, sir, the nobility, the gentry, the clergy are to be\r\nalarmed, overawed, or smothered by the expression of popular opinion\r\nsuch as this, and if no great statesman be raised up in our hour of\r\nneed to undeceive this unhappy multitude, now eagerly rushing or\r\nheedlessly sauntering along the pathway of revolution, as an ox goeth to\r\nthe slaughter or a fool to the correction of the stocks, what is it but\r\na symptom as infallible as it is appalling, that the day of our\r\ngreatness and stability is no more, and that the chill and damp of death\r\nare already creeping over England's glory.' These dolorous spectres\r\nhaunted him incessantly, as they haunted so many who had not the\r\nsovereign excuse of youth, and his rhetoric was perfectly sincere. He\r\nfelt bound to say that, as far as he could form an opinion, the ministry\r\nmost richly deserved impeachment. Its great innovations and its small\r\nalike moved his indignation. When Brougham committed the enormity of\r\nhearing causes on Good Friday, Gladstone repeats with deep complacency a\r\nsaying of Wetherell, that Brougham was the first judge who had done such\r\na thing since Pontius Pilate.\r\n\r\n                         OXFORD ELECTIONEERING\r\n\r\nThe undergraduates took their part in the humours of the great election,\r\nand Oxford turned out her chivalry gallantly to bring in the anti-reform\r\ncandidate for the county to the nomination. 'I mounted the mare to join\r\nthe anti-reform procession,' writes the impassioned student to his\r\nfather, 'and we looked as well as we could do, considering that we were\r\nall covered with mud from head to foot. There was mob enough on both\r\nsides, but I must do them justice to say they were for the most part\r\nexceedingly good-humoured, and after we had dismounted, we went among\r\nthem and elbowed one another and bawled and bellowed with the most\r\nperfect good temper. At the nomination in the town hall there was so\r\nmuch row raised that not one of the candidates could be heard.' The\r\neffect of these exercitations was a hoarseness and cold, which did not,\r\nhowever, prevent the sufferer from taking his part in a mighty bonfire\r\nin Peckwater. On another day:--\r\n\r\n     I went with Denison and another man named Jeffreys between eleven\r\n     and twelve. We began to talk to some men among Weyland's friends;\r\n     they crowded round, and began to holloa at us, and were making a\r\n     sort of ring round us preparatory to a desperate hustle, when lo!\r\n     up rushed a body of Norreys' men from St. Thomas's, broke their\r\n     ranks, raised a shout, and rescued us in great style. I shall ever\r\n     be grateful to the men of St. Thomas's. When we were talking,\r\n     Jeffreys said something which made one man holloa, 'Oh, his\r\n     father's a parson.' This happened to be true, and flabbergasted me,\r\n     but he happily turned it by reminding them, that they were going to\r\n     vote for Mr. Harcourt, son of the greatest parson in England but\r\n     one (Archbishop of York). Afterwards they left me, and I pursued my\r\n     work alone, conversed with a great number, shook hands with a fair\r\n     proportion, made some laugh, and once very nearly got hustled when\r\n     alone, but happily escaped. You would be beyond measure astonished\r\n     how unanimous and how _strong_ is the feeling among the freeholders\r\n     (who may be taken as a fair specimen of the generality of all\r\n     counties) _against_ the catholic question. Reformers and\r\n     anti-reformers were alike sensitive on that point and perfectly\r\n     agreed. One man said to me, 'What, vote for Lord Norreys? Why, he\r\n     voted against the country _both_ times, _for_ the Catholic bill and\r\n     then against the Reform.' What would this atrocious ministry have\r\n     said had the appeal to the voice of the people, which they now\r\n     quote as their authority, been made in 1829? I held forth to a\r\n     working man, possibly a forty-shilling freeholder, [he adds in a\r\n     fragment of later years,] on the established text, reform was\r\n     revolution. To corroborate my doctrine I said, 'Why, look at the\r\n     revolutions in foreign countries,' meaning of course France and\r\n     Belgium. The man looked hard at me and said these very words, 'Damn\r\n     all foreign countries, what has old England to do with foreign\r\n     countries?' This is not the only time that I have received an\r\n     important lesson from a humble source.\r\n\r\n                          SPEECH AT THE UNION\r\n\r\nA more important scene which his own future eminence made in a sense\r\nhistoric, was a debate at the Union upon Reform in the same month, where\r\nhis contribution (May 17th) struck all his hearers with amazement, so\r\nbrilliant, so powerful, so incomparably splendid did it seem to their\r\nyoung eyes. His description of it to his brother (May 20th, 1831) is\r\nmodest enough:--\r\n\r\n     I should really have been glad if your health had been such as to\r\n     have permitted your visiting Oxford last week, so that you might\r\n     have heard our debate, for certainly there had never been anything\r\n     like it known here before and will scarcely be again. The\r\n     discussion on the question that the ministers were incompetent to\r\n     carry on the government of the country was of a miscellaneous\r\n     character, and I moved what they called a 'rider' to the effect\r\n     that the Reform bill threatened to change the form of the British\r\n     government, and ultimately to break up the whole frame of society.\r\n     The debate altogether lasted three nights, and it closed then,\r\n     partly because the _votes_ had got tired of dancing attendance,\r\n     partly because the speakers of the revolutionary side were\r\n     exhausted. There were eight or nine more on ours ready, and indeed\r\n     anxious. As it was, there were I think fifteen speeches on our side\r\n     and thirteen on theirs, or something of that kind. Every man spoke\r\n     above his average, and many very far beyond it. They were generally\r\n     short enough. Moncreiff, a long-winded Scotsman, spouted nearly an\r\n     hour, and I was guilty of three-quarters. I remember at Eton (where\r\n     we used, when I first went into the society, to speak from three to\r\n     ten minutes) I thought it must be one of the finest things in the\r\n     world to speak for three-quarters of an hour, and there was a\r\n     legend circulated about an old member of the society's having done\r\n     so, which used to make us all gape and stare. However, I fear it\r\n     does not necessarily imply much more than length. Doyle spoke\r\n     remarkably well, and made a violent attack on Mr. Canning's\r\n     friends, which Gaskell did his best to answer, but very\r\n     ineffectually from the nature of the case. We got a conversion\r\n     speech from a Christ Church gentleman-commoner, named Alston, which\r\n     produced an excellent effect, and the division was favourable\r\n     beyond anything we had hoped--ninety-four to thirty-eight. We\r\n     should have had larger numbers still had we divided on the first\r\n     night. Great diligence was used by both parties in bringing men\r\n     down, but the tactics on the whole were better on our side, and we\r\n     had fewer truants in proportion to our numbers. England expects\r\n     every man to do his duty; and ours, humble as it is, has been done\r\n     in reference to this question. On Friday I wrote a letter to the\r\n     _Standard_ giving an account of the division, which you will see in\r\n     Saturday's paper, if you think it worth while to refer to it. The\r\n     way in which the present generation of undergraduates is divided\r\n     on the question is quite remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was to prove a memorable one in his career, and a few more\r\nlines about it from his diary will not be considered superfluous:--\r\n\r\n     _May 16th._--Sleepy. Mathematics, few and shuffling, and lecture.\r\n     Read Canning's reform speeches at Liverpool and made extracts. Rode\r\n     out. Debate, which was adjourned. I am to try my hand to-morrow. My\r\n     thoughts were but ill-arranged, but I fear they will be no better\r\n     then. Wine with Anstice. Singing. Tea with Lincoln.\r\n\r\n     _May 17th._--Ethics. Little mathematics. A good deal exhausted in\r\n     forenoon from heat last night. Dined with White and had wine with\r\n     him, also with young Acland. Cogitations on reform, etc. Difficult\r\n     to _select_ matter for a speech, not to gather it. _Spoke at the\r\n     adjourned debate for three-quarters of an hour_; immediately after\r\n     Gaskell, who was preceded by Lincoln. Row afterwards and\r\n     adjournment. Tea with Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nWhen Gladstone sat down, one of his contemporaries has written, 'we all\r\nof us felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred. His father was so\r\nwell pleased with the glories of the speech and with its effect, that he\r\nwished to have it published. Besides his speech, besides the composition\r\nof sturdy placards against the monstrous bill, and besides the\r\npreparation of an elaborate petition[51] and the gathering of 770\r\nsignatures to it, the ardent anti-reformer, though the distance from the\r\ndays of doom in the examination schools was rapidly shrinking, actually\r\nsat down to write a long pamphlet (July 1831) and sent it to Hatchard,\r\nthe publisher. Hatchard doubted the success of an anonymous pamphlet,\r\nand replied in the too familiar formula that has frozen so many thousand\r\nglowing hearts, that he would publish it if the author would take the\r\nmoney risk. The most interesting thing about it is the criticism of the\r\nwriter's shrewd and wise father upon his son's performance (too long for\r\nreproduction here). He went with his son in the main, he says, 'but I\r\ncannot go all your lengths,' and the language of his judgment sheds a\r\ncurious light upon the vehement temperament of Mr. Gladstone at this\r\ntime as it struck an affectionate yet firm and sober monitor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       HEARS HIS FIRST DEBATE\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1831 Mr. Gladstone took some trouble to be present on\r\none of the cardinal occasions in this fluctuating history:--\r\n\r\n     _October 3rd to 8th._--Journey to London. From Henley in\r\n     Blackstone's chaise. Present at five nights' debate of infinite\r\n     interest in the House of Lords. The first, I went forwards and\r\n     underwent a somewhat high pressure. At the four others sat on a\r\n     round transverse rail, very fortunate in being so well placed. Had\r\n     a full view of the peeresses. There nine or ten hours every\r\n     evening. Read Peel's speech and sundry papers relating to King's\r\n     College, which I went to see; also London Bridge. Read introduction\r\n     to Butler. Wrote to Saunders. Much occupied in order-hunting during\r\n     the morning. Lord Brougham's as a speech most wonderful, delivered\r\n     with a power and effect which cannot be appreciated by any hearsay\r\n     mode of information, and with fertile exuberance in sarcasm. In\r\n     point of argument it had, I think, little that was new. Lord Grey's\r\n     most beautiful, Lord Goderich's and Lord Lansdowne's extremely\r\n     good, and in these was comprehended nearly all the oratorical merit\r\n     of the debate. The reasoning or the attempt to reason,\r\n     independently of the success in such attempt, certainly seemed to\r\n     me to be with the opposition. Their best speeches, I thought, were\r\n     those of Lords Harrowby, Carnarvon, Mansfield, Wynford; next Lords\r\n     Lyndhurst, Wharncliffe, and the Duke of Wellington. Lord Grey's\r\n     reply I did not hear, having been compelled by exhaustion to leave\r\n     the House. Remained with Ryder and Pickering in the coffee-room or\r\n     walking about until the division, and joined Wellesley and\r\n     [illegible] as we walked home. Went to bed for an hour,\r\n     breakfasted, and came off by the Alert. Arrived safely, thank God,\r\n     in Oxford. Wrote to my brother and to Gaskell. Tea with Phillimore\r\n     and spent the remainder of the evening with Canning. The\r\n     consequences of the vote may be awful. God avert this. But it was\r\n     an honourable and manly decision, and so may God avert them.\r\n\r\nThis was the memorable occasion when the Lords threw out the Reform bill\r\nby 199 to 158, the division not taking place until six o'clock in the\r\nmorning. The consequences, as the country instantly made manifest, were\r\n'awful' enough to secure the reversal of the decision. It seems, so far\r\nas I can make out, to have been the first debate that one of the most\r\nconsummate debaters that ever lived had the fortune of listening to.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                        READING FOR THE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nMeanwhile intense interest in parliament and the newspapers had not\r\nimpaired his studies. Disgusted as he was at the political outlook, in\r\nthe beginning of July he had fallen fairly to work more or less close\r\nfor ten or twelve hours a day. It 'proved as of old a cure for\r\nill-humour, though in itself not of the most delectable kind. It is odd\r\nenough, though true, that reading hard close-grained stuff produces a\r\nmuch more decided and better effect in this way, than books written\r\nprofessedly for the purpose of entertainment.' Then his eyes became\r\npainful, affected the head, and in August almost brought him to a full\r\nstop. After absolute remission of work for a few days, he slowly spread\r\nfull sail again, and took good care no more to stint either exercise or\r\nsleep, thinking himself, strange as it now sounds, rather below than\r\nabove par for such exertions. He declared that the bodily fatigue, the\r\nmental fatigue, and the anxiety as to the result, made reading for a\r\nclass a thing not to be undergone more than once in a lifetime. Time had\r\nmightier fatigues in store for him than even this. The heavy work among\r\nthe ideas of men of bygone days did not deaden intellectual projects of\r\nhis own. A few days before he went to see the Lords throw out the Reform\r\nbill, he made a curious entry:--\r\n\r\n     _October 3rd, 1831._--Yesterday an idea, a chimera, entered my\r\n     head, of gathering during the progress of my life, notes and\r\n     materials for a work embracing three divisions, Morals, Politics,\r\n     Education, and I commit this notice to paper now, that many years\r\n     hence, if it please God, I may find it either a pleasant or at\r\n     least an instructive reminiscence, a pleasant and instructing one,\r\n     I trust, if I may ever be permitted to execute this design;\r\n     instructive if it shall point while in embryo, and serve to teach\r\n     me the folly of presumptuous schemes conceived during the buoyancy\r\n     of youth, and only relinquished on a discovery of incompetency in\r\n     later years. Meanwhile I am only contemplating the gradual\r\n     accumulation of materials.\r\n\r\nThe reading went on at a steady pace, not without social\r\nintermissions:--\r\n\r\n     _Oct. 11th and 12th._--Rode. Papers. Virgil. Thucydides, both\r\n     days. Also some optics. Wrote a long letter home. Read a chapter of\r\n     Butler each day. Hume. Breakfasted also with Canning to meet Lady\r\n     C[anning]. She received us, I thought, with great kindness, and\r\n     spoke a great deal about Lord Grey's conduct with reference to her\r\n     husband's memory, with great animation and excitement; her hand in\r\n     a strong tremor. It was impossible not to enter into her feelings.\r\n\r\nThen comes the struggle for the palm:--\r\n\r\n     _Monday, November 7th to Saturday 12th._--In the schools or\r\n     preparing. Read most of Niebuhr. Finished going over the\r\n     _Agamemnon_. Got up Aristophanic and other hard words. Went over my\r\n     books of extracts, etc. Read some of Whately's rhetoric. Got up a\r\n     little Polybius, and the history out of Livy, decade one. In the\r\n     schools Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; each day about six and a\r\n     half hours at work or under. First Stratford's speech into Latin\r\n     with logical and rhetorical questions--the latter somewhat\r\n     abstract. Dined at Gaskell's and met Pearson, a clever and\r\n     agreeable man. On Thursday a piece of Johnson's preface in morning,\r\n     in evening critical questions which I did very badly, but I\r\n     afterwards heard, better than _the rest_, which I could not and\r\n     cannot understand. On Friday we had in the morning historical\r\n     questions. Wrote a vast quantity of matter, ill enough digested. In\r\n     the evening, Greek to translate and illustrate. Heard cheering\r\n     accounts indirectly of myself, for which I ought to be very\r\n     thankful.... Dined with Pearson at the Mitre. Very kind in him to\r\n     ask me. Made Saturday in great measure an idle day. Had a good ride\r\n     with Gaskell. Spent part of the evening with him. Read about six\r\n     hours. _Sunday, November 13th._--Chapel thrice. Breakfast and\r\n     much conversation with Cameron. Read Bible. Some divinity of a\r\n     character approaching to cram. Looked over my shorter abstract of\r\n     Butler. Tea with Harrison. Walk with Gaskell. Wine with Hamilton,\r\n     more of a party than I quite liked or expected. Altogether my mind\r\n     was in an unsatisfactory state, though I heard a most admirable\r\n     sermon from Tyler on Bethesda, which could not have been more\r\n     opportune if written on purpose for those who are going into the\r\n     schools. But I am cold, timid, and worldly, and not in a healthy\r\n     state of mind for the great trial of to-morrow, to which I know I\r\n     am utterly and miserably unequal, but which I also know will be\r\n     sealed for good....\r\n\r\nHere is his picture of his _viva voce_ examination:--\r\n\r\n     _November 14th._--Spent the morning chiefly in looking over my\r\n     Polybius; short abstract of ethics, and definitions. Also some hard\r\n     words. Went into the schools at ten, and from this time was little\r\n     troubled with fear. Examined by Stocker in divinity. I did not\r\n     answer as I could have wished. Hampden [the famous heresiarch] in\r\n     science, a beautiful examination, and with every circumstance in my\r\n     favour. He said to me, 'Thank you, you have construed extremely\r\n     well, and appear to be thoroughly acquainted with your books,' or\r\n     something to that effect. Then followed a very clever examination\r\n     in history from Garbett, and an agreeable and short one in my poets\r\n     from Cremer, who spoke very kindly to me at the close. I was only\r\n     put on in eight books besides the Testament, namely Rhetoric,\r\n     Ethics, _Phaedo_, Herodotus, Thucydides, _Odyssey_, Aristophanes\r\n     (_Vespae_), and Persius. Everything was in my favour; the examiners\r\n     kind beyond everything; a good many persons there, and all\r\n     friendly. At the end of the science, of course, my spirits were\r\n     much raised, and I could not help at that moment [giving thanks] to\r\n     Him without whom not even such moderate performances would have\r\n     been in my power. Afterwards rode to Cuddesdon with the Denisons,\r\n     and wrote home with exquisite pleasure.\r\n\r\n                        HIS DOUBLE FIRST CLASS\r\n\r\nI have read a story by some contemporary how all attempts to puzzle him\r\nby questions on the minutest details of Herodotus only brought out his\r\nknowledge more fully; how the excitement reached its climax when the\r\nexaminer, after testing his mastery of some point of theology, said: 'We\r\nwill now leave that part of the subject,' and the candidate, carried\r\naway by his interest in the subject, answered: 'No, sir; if you please,\r\nwe will not leave it yet,' and began to pour forth a fresh stream. Ten\r\ndays later, after a morning much disturbed and excited he rode in the\r\nafternoon, and by half-past four the list was out, with Gladstone and\r\nDenison both of them in the first class; Phillimore and Maurice in the\r\nsecond; Herbert in the fourth.\r\n\r\nThen mathematics were to come. The interval between the two schools he\r\npassed at Cuddesdon, working some ten hours a day at his hardest, riding\r\nevery day with Denison, and all of them in high spirits. But optics,\r\nalgebra, geometry, calculus, trigonometry, and the rest, filled him with\r\nmisgivings for the future. 'Every day I read, I am more and more\r\nthoroughly convinced of my incapacity for the subject.' 'My work\r\ncontinued and my reluctance to exertion increased with it.' For the\r\nSunday before the examination, this is the entry, and a characteristic\r\nand remarkable one it is:--'Teaching in the school morning and evening.\r\nSaunders preached well on \"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\" Read Bible\r\nand four of Horsley's sermons. Paid visits to old people.'\r\n\r\nOn December 10th the mathematical ordeal began, and lasted four days.\r\nThe doctor gave him draughts to quiet his excitement. Better than\r\ndraughts, he read Wordsworth every day. On Sunday (December 11th) he\r\nwent, as usual, twice to chapel, and heard Newman preach 'a most able\r\ndiscourse of a very philosophical character, more apt for reading than\r\nfor hearing--at least I, in the jaded state of my mind, was unable to do\r\nit any justice.' On December 14th, the list was out, and his name was\r\nagain in the first class, again along with Denison. As everybody knows,\r\nPeel had won a double-first twenty-three years before, and in\r\nmathematics Peel had the first class to himself. Mr. Gladstone in each\r\nof the two schools was one of five. Anstice, whose counsels and example\r\nhe counted for so much at one epoch in his collegiate life, in 1830\r\ncarried off the same double crown, and was, like Peel, alone in the\r\nmathematical first class.\r\n\r\n     It was an hour of thrilling happiness, between the past and the\r\n     future, for the future was, I hope, not excluded; and feeling was\r\n     well kept in check by the bustle of preparation for speedy\r\n     departure. Saw the Dean, Biscoe, Saunders (whom I thanked for his\r\n     extreme kindness), and such of my friends as were in Oxford; all\r\n     most warm. The mutual hand-shaking between Denison, Jeffreys, and\r\n     myself, was very hearty. Wine with Bruce.... Packed up my\r\n     things.... Wrote at more or less length to Mrs. G. [his mother],\r\n     Gaskell, Phillimore, Mr. Denison, my old tutor Knapp.... Left\r\n     Oxford on the Champion.\r\n\r\n     _December 15th._--After finding the first practicable coach to\r\n     Cambridge was just able to manage breakfast in Bedford Square. Left\r\n     Holborn at ten, in Cambridge before five.\r\n\r\nHere he was received by Wordsworth, the master of Trinity, and father of\r\nhis Oxford tutor. He had a visit full of the peculiar excitement and\r\nfelicity that those who are capable of it know nowhere else than at\r\nOxford and Cambridge. He heard Hallam recite his declamation; was\r\nintroduced to the mighty Whewell, to Spedding, the great Baconian, to\r\nSmyth, the professor of history, to Blakesley; renewed his acquaintance\r\nwith the elder Hallam; listened to glorious anthems at Trinity and\r\nKing's; tried to hear a sermon from Simeon, the head of the English\r\nevangelicals; met Stanhope, an old Eton man, and the two sons of Lord\r\nGrey; and 'copied a letter of Mr. Pitt's.' From Cambridge he made his\r\nway home, having thus triumphantly achieved the first stage of his long\r\nlife journey. Amid the manifold mutations of his career, to Oxford his\r\naffection was passionate as it was constant. 'There is not a man that\r\nhas passed through that great and famous university that can say with\r\nmore truth than I can say, I love her from the bottom of my heart.'[52]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n                    THOUGHTS ON FUTURE PROFESSION\r\n\r\nAnother episode must have a place before I close this chapter. At the\r\nend of 1828, the youthful Gladstone had composed a long letter, of which\r\nthe manuscript survives, to a Liverpool newspaper, earnestly contesting\r\nits appalling proposition that 'man has no more control over his belief,\r\nthan he has over his stature or his colour,' and beseeching the editor\r\nto try Leslie's _Short Method with the Deists_, if he be unfortunate\r\nenough to doubt the authority of the Bible. At Oxford his fervour\r\ncarried him beyond the fluent tract to a personal decision. On August\r\n4th, 1830, the entry is this:--'Began Thucydides. Also working up\r\nHerodotus. [Greek: exertumenos]. Construing Thucydides at night. Uncomfortable\r\nagain and much distracted with doubts as to my future line of conduct.\r\nGod direct me. I am utterly blind. Wrote a very long letter to my dear\r\nfather on the subject of my future profession, wishing if possible to\r\nbring the question to an immediate and final settlement.' The letter is\r\nexorbitant in length, it is vague, it is obscure; but the appeal\r\ncontained in it is as earnest as any appeal from son to parent on such a\r\nsubject ever was, and it is of special interest as the first definite\r\nindication alike of the extraordinary intensity of his religious\r\ndisposition, and of that double-mindedness, that division of sensibility\r\nbetween the demands of spiritual and of secular life, which remained\r\nthroughout one of the marking traits of his career. He declares his\r\nconviction that his duty, alike to man as a social being, and as a\r\nrational and reasonable being to God, summons him with a voice too\r\nimperative to be resisted, to forsake the ordinary callings of the world\r\nand to take Upon himself the clerical office. The special need of\r\ndevotion to that office, he argues, must be plain to any one who 'casts\r\nhis eye over the moral wilderness of the world, who contemplates the\r\npursuits, desires, designs, and principles of the beings that move so\r\nbusily in it to and fro, without an object beyond the finding food for\r\nit, mental or bodily, for the present moment.' This letter the reader\r\nwill find in full elsewhere.[53] The missionary impulse, the yearning\r\nfor some apostolic destination, the glow of self-devotion to a supreme\r\nexternal will, is a well-known element in the youth of ardent natures of\r\neither sex. In a thousand forms, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil,\r\nsuch a mood has played its part in history. In this case, as in many\r\nanother, the impulse in its first shape did not endure, but in essence\r\nit never faded.\r\n\r\nHis father replied as a wise man was sure to do, almost with sympathy,\r\nwith entire patience, and with thorough common sense. The son dutifully\r\naccepts the admonition that it is too early to decide so grave an issue,\r\nand that the immediate matter is the approaching performance in the\r\nexamination schools. 'I highly approve,' his father had written (Nov.\r\n8th, 1830), 'your proposal to leave undetermined the profession you are\r\nto follow, until you return from the continent and complete your\r\neducation in all respects. You will then have seen more of the world and\r\nhave greater confidence in the choice you may make; for it will then\r\nrest wholly with yourself, having our advice whenever you may wish for\r\nit.' The critical issue was now finally settled. At almost equal length,\r\nand in parts of this second letter no less vague and obscure than the\r\nfirst, but with more concentrated power, Mr. Gladstone tells his father\r\n(Jan. 17th, 1832) how the excitement has subsided, but still he sees at\r\nhand a great crisis in the history of mankind. New principles, he says,\r\nprevail in morals, politics, education. Enlightened self-interest is\r\nmade the substitute for the old bonds of unreasoned attachment, and\r\nunder the plausible maxim that knowledge is power, one kind of ignorance\r\nis made to take the place of another kind. Christianity teaches that the\r\nhead is to be exalted through the heart, but Benthamism maintains that\r\nthe heart is to be amended through the head. The conflict proceeding in\r\nparliament foreshadows a contest for the existence of the church\r\nestablishment, to be assailed through its property. The whole foundation\r\nof society may go. Under circumstances so formidable, he dares not look\r\nfor the comparative calm and ease of a professional life. He must hold\r\nhimself free of attachment to any single post and function of a\r\ntechnical nature. And so--to make the long story short--'My own desires\r\nfor future life are exactly coincident with yours, in so far as I am\r\nacquainted with them; believing them to be a _profession_ of the law,\r\nwith a view substantially to studying the constitutional branch of it,\r\nand a subsequent experiment, as time and circumstances might offer, on\r\nwhat is termed public life.' 'It tortures me,' he had written to his\r\nbrother John (August 29th, 1830), 'to think of an inclination opposed to\r\nthat of my beloved father,' and this was evidently one of the\r\npreponderant motives in his final decision.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, while the fire of apostolic devotion was still\r\nfervid within him, he had penned a couple of sentences that contain\r\nwords of deeper meaning than he could surely know:--'I am willing to\r\npersuade myself that in spite of other longings which I often feel, my\r\nheart is prepared to yield other hopes and other desires for this--of\r\nbeing permitted to be the humblest of those who may be commissioned to\r\nset before the eyes of man, still great even, in his ruins, the\r\nmagnificence and the glory of Christian truth. Especially as I feel that\r\nmy temperament is so excitable, that I should fear giving up my mind to\r\nother subjects which have ever proved sufficiently alluring to me, and\r\nwhich I fear would make my life a fever of unsatisfied longings and\r\nexpectations.' So men unconsciously often hint an oracle of their lives.\r\nPerhaps these forebodings of a high-wrought hour may in other hues have\r\nat many moments come back to Mr. Gladstone's mind, even in the full\r\nsunshine of a triumphant career of duty, virtue, power, and renown.\r\n\r\n                             MEDITATIONS\r\n\r\nThe entry in his diary, suggested by the return of his birthday (Dec.\r\n29, 1831), closes with the words, 'This has been my debating society\r\nyear, now, I fancy, done with. Politics are fascinating to me; perhaps\r\ntoo fascinating.' Higher thoughts than this press in upon him:--\r\n\r\n     Industry of a kind and for a time there has been, but the industry\r\n     of necessity, not of principle. I would fain believe that my\r\n     sentiments in religion have been somewhat enlarged and\r\n     untrammelled, but if this be true, my responsibility is indeed\r\n     augmented, but wherein have my deeds of duty been proportionally\r\n     modified?... One conclusion theoretically has been much on my\r\n     mind--it is the increased importance and necessity and benefit of\r\n     prayer--of the life of obedience and self-sacrifice. May God use me\r\n     as a vessel for his own purposes, of whatever character and results\r\n     in relation to myself.... May the God who loves us all, still\r\n     vouchsafe me a testimony of His abiding presence in the protracted,\r\n     though well nigh dormant life of a desire which at times has risen\r\n     high in my soul, a fervent and a buoyant hope that I might work an\r\n     energetic work in this world, and by that work (whereof the worker\r\n     is only God) I might grow into the image of the Redeemer.... It\r\n     matters not whether the sphere of duty be large or small, but may\r\n     it be duly filled. May those faint and languishing embers be\r\n     kindled by the truth of the everlasting spirit into a living and a\r\n     life-giving flame.\r\n\r\nEvery reader will remember how, just two hundred years before, the\r\nsublimest of English poets had on his twenty-third birthday closed the\r\nsame self-reproach for sluggishness of inward life, with the same\r\naspiration:--\r\n\r\n  Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,\r\n  It shall be still in strictest measure even\r\n  To that same lot however mean or high,\r\n  Towards which time leads me and the will of heaven.\r\n  All is, if I have grace to use it so,\r\n  As ever in my great taskmaster's eye.\r\n\r\nTwo generations after he had quitted the university, Mr. Gladstone\r\nsummed up her influence upon him:--\r\n\r\n     Oxford had rather tended to hide from me the great fact that\r\n     liberty is a great and precious gift of God, and that human\r\n     excellence cannot grow up in a nation without it. And yet I do not\r\n     hesitate to say that Oxford had even at this time laid the\r\n     foundations of my liberalism. School pursuits had revealed little;\r\n     but in the region of philosophy she had initiated if not inured me\r\n     to the pursuit of truth as an end of study. The splendid integrity\r\n     of Aristotle, and still more of Butler, conferred upon me an\r\n     inestimable service. Elsewhere I have not scrupled to speak with\r\n     severity of myself, but I declare that while in the arms of Oxford,\r\n     I was possessed through and through with a single-minded and\r\n     passionate love of truth, with a virgin love of truth, so that,\r\n     although I might be swathed in clouds of prejudice there was\r\n     something of an eye within, that might gradually pierce them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] Charles Wordsworth's _Annals_.\r\n\r\n[35] After Peel had begun his career, Jackson gave him a piece of advice\r\nthat would have pleased Mr. Gladstone:--'Let no day pass without your\r\nhaving Homer in your hand. Elevate your own mind by continual meditation\r\non the vastness of his comprehension and the unerring accuracy of all\r\nhis conceptions. If you will but read him four or five times over every\r\nyear, in a half a dozen years you will know him by heart, and he well\r\ndeserves it.'--Parker's _Life of Sir R. Peel_, i. p. 28.\r\n\r\n[36] On the four periods of Aristotelian study at Oxford in the first\r\nhalf of the century see Pattison's Essays, i.

In my opinion it is a school of extraordinary\r\n     power and efficacy. It is a great and noble school for the creation\r\n     of all the qualities of force, suppleness, and versatility of\r\n     intellect. And it is also a great moral school. It is a school of\r\n     temper. It is also a school of patience. It is a school of honour,\r\n     and it is a school of justice.--GLADSTONE (1878).\r\n\r\n                               FOREIGN TRAVEL\r\n\r\nLeaving home in the latter part of January (1832), with a Wordsworth for\r\na pocket companion, Mr. Gladstone made his way to Oxford, where he\r\nlaboured through his packing, settled accounts, 'heard a very able\r\nsermon indeed from Newman at St. Mary's,' took his bachelor's degree\r\n(Jan. 26), and after a day or two with relatives and friends in London,\r\nleft England along with his brother John at the beginning of February.\r\nHe did not return until the end of July. He visited Brussels, Paris,\r\nFlorence, Naples, Rome, Venice, and Milan. Of this long journey he kept\r\na full record, and it contains one entry of no small moment in his\r\nmental history. A conception now began to possess him, that according to\r\none religious school kindled a saving illumination, and according to\r\nanother threw something of a shade upon his future path. In either view\r\nit marked a change of spiritual course, a transformation not of religion\r\nas the centre of his being, for that it always was, but of the frame and\r\nmould within which religion was to expand.\r\n\r\nIn entering St. Peter's at Rome (March 31, 1832) he experienced his\r\n'first conception of unity in the Church,' and first longed for its\r\nvisible attainment. Here he felt 'the pain and shame of the schism which\r\nseparates us from Rome--whose guilt surely rests not upon the venerable\r\nfathers of the English Reformed Church but upon Rome itself, yet whose\r\nmelancholy effects the mind is doomed to feel when you enter this\r\nmagnificent temple and behold in its walls the images of Christian\r\nsaints and the words of everlasting truth; yet such is the mass of\r\nintervening encumbrances that you scarcely own, and can yet more\r\nscantily realise, any bond of sympathy or union.' This was no fleeting\r\nimpression of a traveller. It had been preceded by a disenchantment, for\r\nhe had made his way from Turin to Pinerol, and seen one of the Vaudois\r\nvalleys. He had framed a lofty conception of the people as ideal\r\nChristians, and he underwent a chill of disappointment on finding them\r\napparently much like other men. Even the pastor, though a quiet,\r\ninoffensive man, gave no sign of energy or of what would have been\r\ncalled in England vital religion. With this chill at his heart he came\r\nupon the atmosphere of gorgeous Rome. It was, however, in the words of\r\nClough's fine line from _Easter Day_, 'through the great sinful streets\r\nof Naples as he passed,' that a great mutation overtook him.\r\n\r\n     One Sunday (May 13) something, I know not what, set me on examining\r\n     the occasional offices of the church in the prayer book. They made\r\n     a strong impression upon me on that very day, and the impression\r\n     has never been effaced. I had previously taken a great deal of\r\n     teaching direct from the Bible, as best I could, but now the figure\r\n     of the Church arose before me as a teacher too, and I gradually\r\n     found in how incomplete and fragmentary a manner I had drawn divine\r\n     truth from the sacred volume, as indeed I had also missed in the\r\n     thirty-nine articles some things which ought to have taught me\r\n     better. Such, for I believe that I have given the fact as it\r\n     occurred, in its silence and its solitude, was my first\r\n     introduction to the august conception of the Church of Christ. It\r\n     presented to me Christianity under an aspect in which I had not yet\r\n     known it: its ministry of symbols, its channels of grace, its\r\n     unending line of teachers joining from the Head: a sublime\r\n     construction, based throughout upon historic fact, uplifting the\r\n     idea of the community in which we live, and of the access which it\r\n     enjoys through the new and living way to the presence of the Most\r\n     High. From this time I began to feel my way by decrees into or\r\n     towards a true notion of the Church. It became a definite and\r\n     organised idea when, at the suggestion of James Hope, I read the\r\n     just published and remarkable work of Palmer. But the charm of\r\n     freshness lay upon that first disclosure of 1832.\r\n\r\nThis mighty question:--what is the nature of a church and what the\r\nduties, titles, and symbols of faithful membership, which in divers\r\nforms had shaken the world for so many ages and now first dawned upon\r\nhis ardent mind, was the germ of a deep and lasting pre-occupation of\r\nwhich we shall speedily and without cessation find abundant traces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                           OFFER OF A SEAT\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, the great rival interest in Mr. Gladstone's life, if\r\nrival we may call it, was forced into startling prominence before him.\r\nAt Milan he received a letter from Lord Lincoln, saying that he was\r\ncommissioned by his father, the Duke of Newcastle, to inform him that\r\nhis influence in the borough of Newark was at Mr. Gladstone's disposal\r\nif he should be ready to enter parliamentary life. This was the fruit of\r\nhis famous anti-reform speech at the Oxford Union. No wonder that such\r\nan offer made him giddy. 'This stunning and overpowering proposal,' he\r\nsays to his father (July 8), 'naturally left me the whole of the evening\r\non which I received it, in a flutter of confusion. Since that evening\r\nthere has been time to reflect, and to see that it is not of so\r\nintoxicating a character as it seemed at first. First, because the Duke\r\nof Newcastle's offer must have been made at the instance of a single\r\nperson (Lincoln), that person young and sanguine, and I may say in such\r\na matter partial.... This much at least became clear to me by the time I\r\nhad recovered my breath: that decidedly more than mere permission from\r\nmy dear father would be necessary to authorise my entering on the\r\nconsideration of particulars at all.' And then he falls into a vein of\r\ndevout reflection, almost as if this sudden destination of his life were\r\nsome irrevocable priesthood or vow of monastic profession, and not the\r\nmere stringent secularity of labour in a parliament. It would be thin\r\nand narrow to count all this an overstrain. To a nature like his, of\r\nsuch eager strength of equipment; conscious of life as a battle and not\r\na parade; apt for all external action yet with a burning glow of light\r\nand fire in the internal spirit; resolute from the first in small things\r\nand in great against aimless drift and eddy,--to such an one the moment\r\nof fixing alike the goal and the track may well have been grave.\r\n\r\nThen points of doubt arose. 'It is, I daresay, in your\r\nrecollection,'--this to his father,--'that at the time when Mr. Canning\r\ncame to power, the Duke of Newcastle, in the House of Lords, declared\r\nhim the most profligate minister the country had ever had. Now it struck\r\nme to inquire of myself, does the duke know the feelings I happen to\r\nentertain towards Mr. Canning? Does he know, or can he have had in his\r\nmind, my father's connection with Mr. Canning?' The duke had in fact\r\nbeen one of the busiest and bitterest of Canning's enemies, and had\r\nafterwards in the same spirit striven with might and main to keep\r\nHuskisson out of the Wellington cabinet. Another awkwardness appeared.\r\nThe duke had offered a handsome contribution towards expenses. Would not\r\nthis tend to abridge the member's independence? What was the footing on\r\nwhich patron and member were to stand? Mr. Gladstone was informed by his\r\nbrother that the duke had neither heretofore asked for pledges, nor now\r\ndemanded them.\r\n\r\nAfter a very brief correspondence with his shrewd and generous father,\r\nthe plunge was taken, and on his return to England, after a fortnight\r\nspent 'in an amphibious state between that of a candidate and [Greek: idiotes]\r\nor private person,' he issued his address to the electors of Newark\r\n(August 4, 1832). He did not go actually on to the ground until the end\r\nof September. The intervening weeks he spent with his family at Torquay,\r\nwhere he varied electioneering correspondence and yachting with plenty\r\nof sufficiently serious reading from Blackstone and Plato and the\r\n_Excursion_ down to _Corinne_. One Sunday morning (September 23), his\r\nfather burst into his bedroom, with the news that his presence was\r\nurgently needed at Newark. 'I rose, dressed, and breakfasted speedily,\r\nwith infinite disgust. I left Torquay at 83/4 and devoted my Sunday to the\r\njourney. Was I right?... My father drove me to Newton; chaise to Exeter.\r\nThere near an hour; went to the cathedral and heard a part of the\r\nprayers. Mail to London. Conversation with a tory countryman who got in\r\nfor a few miles, on Sunday travelling, which we agreed in disapproving.\r\nGave him some tracts. Excellent mail. Dined at Yeovil; read a little of\r\nthe _Christian Year_ [published 1827]. At 61/2 A.M. arrived at Piccadilly,\r\n181/2 hours from Exeter. Went to Fetter Lane, washed and breakfasted, and\r\ncame off at 8 o'clock by a High Flyer for Newark. The sun hovered red\r\nand cold through the heavy fog of London sky, but in the country the day\r\nwas fine. Tea at Stamford; arrived at Newark at midnight.' Such in forty\r\nhours was the first of Mr. Gladstone's countless political pilgrimages.\r\n\r\nHis two election addresses are a curious starting-point for so memorable\r\na journey. Thrown into the form of a modern programme, the points are\r\nthese:--union of church and state, the defence in particular of our\r\nIrish establishments; correction of the poor laws; allotment of cottage\r\ngrounds; adequate remuneration of labour; a system of Christian\r\ninstruction for the West Indian slaves, but no emancipation until that\r\ninstruction had fitted them for it; a dignified and impartial foreign\r\npolicy. The duke was much startled by the passage about labour receiving\r\nadequate remuneration, 'which unhappily among several classes of our\r\nfellow countrymen is not now the case.' He did not, however, interfere.\r\nThe whig newspaper said roundly of the first of Mr. Gladstone's two\r\naddresses, that a more jumbled collection of words had seldom been sent\r\nfrom the press. The tory paper, on the contrary, congratulated the\r\nconstituency on a candidate of considerable commercial experience and\r\ntalent. The anti-slavery men fought him stoutly. They put his name into\r\ntheir black schedule with nine-and-twenty other candidates, they\r\nharried him with posers from a pamphlet of his father's, and they met\r\nhis doctrine that if slavery were sinful the Bible would not have\r\ncommended the regulation of it, by bluntly asking him on the hustings\r\nwhether he knew a text in Exodus declaring that 'he that stealeth a man\r\nand selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put\r\nto death.' His father's pamphlets undoubtedly exposed a good deal of\r\nsurface. We cannot be surprised that any adherent of these standard\r\nsophistries should be placed on the black list of the zealous soldiers\r\nof humanity. The candidate held to the ground he had taken at Oxford and\r\nin his election address, and apparently made converts. He had an\r\ninterview with forty voters of abolitionist complexion at his hotel, and\r\naccording to the friendly narrative of his brother, who was present, 'he\r\nshone not only in his powers of conversation, but by the tact,\r\nquickness, and talent with which he made his replies, to the thorough\r\nand complete satisfaction of baptists, wesleyan methodists, and I may\r\nsay even, of almost every religious sect! Not one refused their vote:\r\nthey came forward, and enrolled their names, though before, I believe,\r\nthey never supported any one on the duke's interest!'\r\n\r\n                      ISSUES ADDRESS AT NEWARK\r\n\r\nThe humours of an election of the ancient sort are a very old story, and\r\nNewark had its full share of them. The register contained rather under\r\nsixteen hundred voters on a scot and lot qualification, to elect a\r\ncouple of members. The principal influence over about one quarter of\r\nthem was exercised by the Duke of Newcastle, who three years before had\r\npunished the whigs of the borough for the outrage of voting against his\r\nnominee, by serving, in concert with another proprietor, forty of them\r\nwith notice to quit. Then the trodden worm turned. The notices were\r\nframed, affixed to poles, and carried with bands of music through the\r\nstreets. Even the audacity of a petition to parliament was projected.\r\nThe duke, whose chief fault was not to know that time had brought him\r\ninto a novel age, defended himself with the haughty truism, then just\r\nceasing to be true, that he had a right to do as he liked with his own.\r\nThis clear-cut enunciation of a vanishing principle became a sort of\r\nlandmark, and gave to his name an unpleasing immortality in our\r\npolitical history. In the high tide of agitation for reform the whigs\r\ngave the duke a beating, and brought their man to the top of the poll, a\r\ntory being his colleague. Handley, the tory, on our present occasion\r\nseemed safe, and the fight lay between Mr. Gladstone and Sergeant Wilde,\r\nthe sitting whig, a lawyer of merit and eminence, who eighteen years\r\nlater went to the woolsack as Lord Truro. Reform at Newark was already\r\non the ebb. Mr. Gladstone, though mocked as a mere schoolboy, and\r\nfiercely assailed as a slavery man, exhibited from the first hour of the\r\nfight tremendous gifts of speech and skill of fence. His Red club worked\r\nvaliantly; the sergeant did not play his cards skilfully; and pretty\r\nearly in the long struggle it was felt that the duke would this time\r\ncome into his own again. The young student soon showed that his double\r\nfirst class, his love of books, his religious preoccupations, had not\r\nunfitted him by a single jot for one of the most arduous of all forms of\r\nthe battle of life. He proved a diligent and prepossessing canvasser, an\r\nuntiring combatant, and of course the readiest and most fluent of\r\nspeakers. Wilde after hearing him said sententiously to one of his own\r\nsupporters, 'There is a great future before this young man.' The rather\r\nrotten borough became suffused with the radiant atmosphere of Olympus.\r\nThe ladies presented their hero with a banner of red silk, and an\r\naddress expressive of their conviction that the good old Red cause was\r\nthe salvation of their ancient borough. The young candidate in reply\r\nspeedily put it in far more glowing colours. It was no trivial banner of\r\na party club, it was the red flag of England that he saw before him, the\r\nsymbol of national moderation and national power, under which, when\r\nevery throne on the continent had crumbled into dust beneath the\r\ntyrannous strength of France, mankind had found sure refuge and\r\ntriumphant hope, and the blast that tore every other ensign to tatters\r\nserved only to unfold their own and display its beauty and its glory.\r\nAmid these oratorical splendours the old hands of the club silently\r\nsupplemented eloquence and argument by darker agencies, of which\r\nhappily the candidate knew little until after. There was a red band and\r\neach musician received fifteen shillings a day, there happening\r\naccidentally to be among them no fewer than ten patriotic red plumpers.\r\nLarge tea-parties attracted red ladies. The inns great and small were\r\nthrown joyously open on one side or other, and when the time came, our\r\nnational heroes from Robin Hood to Lord Nelson and the Duke of\r\nWellington, as well as half the animal kingdom, the swan and salmon,\r\nhorses, bulls, boars, lions, and eagles, of all the colours of the\r\nrainbow and in every kind of strange partnership, sent in bills for meat\r\nand liquor supplied to free and independent electors to the tune of a\r\ncouple of thousand pounds. Apart from these black arts, and apart from\r\nthe duke's interest, there was a good force of the staunch and honest\r\ntype, the life-blood of electioneering and the salvation of party\r\ngovernment, who cried stoutly, 'I was born Red, I live Red, and I will\r\ndie Red.' 'We started on the canvass,' says one who was with Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'at eight in the morning and worked at it for about nine\r\nhours, with a great crowd, band and flags, and innumerable glasses of\r\nbeer and wine all jumbled together; then a dinner of 30 or 40, with\r\nspeeches and songs until say ten o'clock; then he always played a rubber\r\nof whist, and about twelve or one I got to bed and not to sleep.'\r\n\r\n                      HUMOURS OF AN OLD ELECTION\r\n\r\nAt length the end came. At the nomination the show of hands was against\r\nthe reds, but when the poll was taken and closed on the second day,\r\nGladstone appeared at the head of it with 887 votes, against 798 for his\r\ncolleague Handley, and 726 for the fallen Wilde. 'Yesterday' (Dec. 13,\r\n1832), he tells his father, 'we went to the town hall at 9 A.M., when\r\nthe mayor cast up the numbers and declared the poll. While he was doing\r\nthis the popular wrath vented itself for the most part upon Handley....\r\nThe sergeant obtained me a hearing, and I spoke for perhaps an hour or\r\nmore, but it was flat work, as they were no more than patient, and\r\nagreed with but little that I said. The sergeant then spoke for an hour\r\nand a half.... He went into matters connected with his own adieu to\r\nNewark, besought the people most energetically to bear with their\r\ndisappointment like men, and expressed his farewell with great depth of\r\nfeeling. Affected to tears himself, he affected others also. In the\r\nevening near fifty dined here [Clinton Arms] and the utmost enthusiasm\r\nwas manifested.' The new member began his first speech as a member of\r\nparliament as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen: In looking forward to the field which is now opened\r\n     before me, I cannot but conceive that I shall often be reproached\r\n     with being not your representative but the representative of the\r\n     Duke of Newcastle. Now I should rather incline to exaggerate than\r\n     to extenuate such connection as does exist between me and that\r\n     nobleman: and for my part should have no reluctance to see every\r\n     sentiment which ever passed between us, whether by letter or by\r\n     word of mouth, exposed to the view of the world. I met the Duke of\r\n     Newcastle upon the broad ground of public principle, and upon that\r\n     ground alone. I own no other bond of union with him than this, that\r\n     he in his exalted sphere, and I in my humble one, entertained the\r\n     same persuasion, that the institutions of this country are to be\r\n     defended against those who threaten their destruction, at all\r\n     hazards, and to all extremities. Why do you return me to\r\n     parliament? Not because I am the Duke of Newcastle's man, simply:\r\n     but because, coinciding with the duke in political sentiment, you\r\n     likewise admit that one possessing so large a property here, and\r\n     faithfully discharging the duties which the possession of that\r\n     property entails, ought in the natural course of things to exercise\r\n     a certain influence. You return me to parliament, not merely\r\n     because I am the Duke of Newcastle's man: but because both the man\r\n     whom the duke has sent, and the duke himself, are _your men_.\r\n\r\n                         RETURNED FOR NEWARK\r\n\r\nThe election was of course pointed to by rejoicing conservatives as a\r\nproof the more of that reaction which the ministerial and radical press\r\nwas audacious enough to laugh at. This borough, says the local\r\njournalist, was led away by the bubble reform, to support those who by\r\nspecious and showy qualification had dazzled their eyes; delusion had\r\nvanished, shadows satisfied no longer, Newark was restored to its high\r\nplace in the esteem of the friends of order and good government. Of\r\ncourse the intimates of the days of his youth were delighted. We want\r\nsuch a man as Gladstone, wrote Hallam to Gaskell (October 1, 1832); 'in\r\nsome things he is likely to be obstinate and prejudiced; but he has a\r\nfine fund of high chivalrous tory sentiment, and a tongue, moreover, to\r\nlet it loose with. I think he may do a great deal.'\r\n\r\nIn the course of his three months of sojourn at Newark Mr. Gladstone\r\npaid his first visit to the great man at Clumber.\r\n\r\n     The duke received me, he tells his father, with the greatest\r\n     kindness, and conversed with such ease and familiarity of manner as\r\n     speedily to dispel a certain degree of awe which I had previously\r\n     entertained, and to throw me perhaps more off my guard than I ought\r\n     to have been in company with a man of his age and rank.... The\r\n     utmost regularity and subordination appears to prevail in the\r\n     family, and no doubt it is in many respects a good specimen of the\r\n     old English style. He is apparently a most affectionate father, but\r\n     still the sons and daughters are under a certain degree of\r\n     restraint in his presence.... A man, be his station of life what it\r\n     may, more entirely divested of personal pride and arrogance, more\r\n     single-minded and disinterested in his views, or more courageous\r\n     and resolute in determination to adhere to them as the dictates of\r\n     his own conscience, I cannot conceive.\r\n\r\nFrom this frigid interior Mr. Gladstone made his way to the genial\r\ncompany of Milnes Gaskell at Thornes and had a delightful week. Thence\r\nhe proceeded to spend some days with his sick mother at Leamington. 'We\r\nhave been singularly dealt with as a family,' he observes, 'once\r\nsnatched from a position where we were what is called entering society,\r\nand sent to comparative seclusion as regards family establishment--and\r\nnow again prevented from assuming the situation that seems the natural\r\ntermination of a career like my father's. Here is a noble trial--for me\r\npersonally to exercise a kindly and unselfish feeling, if amid the\r\nexcitements and allurements now near me, I am enabled duly to realise\r\nthe bond of consanguinity and suffer with those whom Providence has\r\nordained to suffer.' And this assuredly was no mere entry in a journal.\r\nIn betrothals, marriages, deaths, on all the great occasions of life in\r\nhis circle, his letters under old-fashioned formalities of phrase yet\r\nbeat with a marked and living pulse of genuine interest, solicitude,\r\nsympathy, unselfishness, and union.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nAs always, he sought refreshment from turmoil that was only moderately\r\ncongenial to him, in reading and writing. Among much else he learns\r\nShelley by heart, but his devotion to Wordsworth is unshaken. 'One\r\nremarkable similarity prevails between Wordsworth and Shelley; the\r\nquality of combining and connecting everywhere external nature with\r\ninternal and unseen mind. But how different are they in applications. It\r\nfrets and irritates the one, it is the key to the peacefulness of the\r\nother.' Two books of _Paradise Regained_, he finds 'very objectionable\r\non religious grounds,'--the books presumably where Milton has been\r\nconvicted of Arian heresy. He still has energy enough left for more\r\nmundane things, to write a succession of articles for the _Liverpool\r\nStandard_, and he finds time to record his joy (December 7) 'over five\r\nEton first classes' at Oxford. Then, by and by, the election accounts\r\ncome in. The arrangement had been made that the expenses were not to\r\nexceed a thousand pounds, of which the duke was to contribute one half,\r\nand John Gladstone the other half. It now appeared that twice as much\r\nwould not suffice. The new member flung himself with all his soul into a\r\nstruggle with his committee against the practice of opening public\r\nhouses and the exorbitant demands that came of it. Open houses, he\r\nprotested, meant profligate expenditure and organised drunkenness; they\r\nwere not a pecuniary question, but a question of right and wrong. In the\r\nafternoon of the second day of polling, his agent had said to him,\r\nspeaking about special constables, that he scarcely knew how they could\r\nbe got if wanted, for he thought nearly every man in the town was drunk.\r\nIt was in vain that the committee assured him of the discouraging truth\r\nthat a certain proportion of the voters could not be got to the poll\r\nwithout a breakfast; and an observer from another planet might perhaps\r\nhave asked himself whether all this was so remarkable an improvement on\r\nthe duke doing what he liked with his own. Mr. Gladstone still stood to\r\nit that a system of entertainment that ended in producing a state of\r\ngeneral intoxication, was the most demoralising and vicious of all forms\r\nof outlay, and the Newark worthies were bewildered and confounded by the\r\ngigantic dialectical and rhetorical resources of their incensed\r\nrepresentative. The fierce battle lasted, with moments of mitigation,\r\nover many of the thirteen years of the connection. Of all the measures\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone was destined in days to come to place upon the\r\nstatute book, none was more salutary than the law that purified corrupt\r\npractices at elections.[54]\r\n\r\n                             HIS BIRTHDAY\r\n\r\nOn his birthday at the close of this eventful year, here is his entry in\r\nhis diary:--'On this day I have completed my twenty-third year.... The\r\nexertions of the year have been smaller than those of the last, but in\r\nsome respects the diminution has been unavoidable. In future I hope\r\ncircumstances will bind me down to work with a rigour which my natural\r\nsluggishness will find it impossible to elude. I wish that I could hope\r\nmy frame of mind had been in any degree removed from earth and brought\r\nnearer to heaven, that the habit of my mind had been imbued with\r\nsomething of that spirit which is not of this world. I have now\r\nfamiliarised myself with maxims sanctioning and encouraging a degree of\r\nintercourse with society, perhaps attended with much risk.... Nor do I\r\nnow think myself warranted in withdrawing from the practices of my\r\nfellow men except when they really _involve_ an encouragement of sin, in\r\nwhich case I do certainly rank races and theatres....' 'Periods like\r\nthese,' he writes to his friend Gaskell (January 3, 1833), 'grievous\r\ngenerally in many of their results, are by no means unfavourable to the\r\ndue growth and progress of individual character. I remember a very wise\r\nsaying of Archidamus in Thucydides, that the being educated [Greek: en tois\r\nanankaiotatois] brings strength and efficacy to the character.'[55]\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters to his father at this exciting epoch Mr.\r\nGladstone says, that before the sudden opening now made for him, what he\r\nhad marked out for himself was 'a good many years of silent reading and\r\ninquiry.' That blessed dream was over; his own temperament and outer\r\ncircumstances, both of them made its realisation impossible; but in a\r\nsense he clung to it all his days. He entered at Lincoln's Inn (January\r\n25), and he dined pretty frequently in hall down to 1839, meeting many\r\nold Eton and Oxford acquaintances, more genuine law students than\r\nhimself. He kept thirteen terms but was never called to the bar. If he\r\nhad intended to undergo a legal training, the design was ended by\r\nNewark. After residing for a short time in lodgings in Jermyn Street, he\r\ntook quarters at the Albany (March 1833), which remained his London home\r\nfor six years. 'I am getting on rapidly with my furnishing,' he tells\r\nhis father, 'and I shall be able, I feel confident, to do it all,\r\nincluding plate, within the liberal limits which you allow. I cannot\r\nwarmly enough thank you for the terms and footing on which you propose\r\nto place me in the chambers, but I really fear that after this year my\r\nallowance in all will be greater not only than I have any title to, but\r\nthan I ought to accept without blushing.' He became a member of the\r\nOxford and Cambridge Club the previous month,[56] and now was 'elected\r\n_without_ my will (but not more than without it) a member of the Carlton\r\nClub.' He would not go to dinner parties on Sundays, not even with Sir\r\nRobert Peel. He was closely attentive to the minor duties of social\r\nlife, if duties they be; he was a strict observer of the etiquette of\r\ncalls, and on some afternoons he notes that he made a dozen or fourteen\r\nof them. He frequented musical parties, where his fine voice, now\r\nreasonably well trained, made him a welcome guest, and he goes to public\r\nconcerts where he finds Pasta and Schroeder splendid. His irrepressible\r\ndesire to expand himself in writing or in speech found a vent in\r\nconstant articles in the _Liverpool Standard_, neither better nor worse\r\nthan the ordinary juvenilia of a keen young college politician. He was\r\nconfident that, whether estimated by their numbers, their wealth, or\r\ntheir respectability, the conservatives indubitably held in their hands\r\nthe means and elements of permanent power. He discharges a fusillade\r\nfrom Roman history against the bare idea of vote by ballot, quotes\r\nCicero as its determined enemy, and ascribes to secret suffrage the fall\r\nof the republic. He quotes with much zest a sentence from an\r\nultra-radical journal that the life of the West Indian negro is\r\nhappiness itself compared with that of the poor inmate of our\r\nspinning-mills. He scores a good point for the patron of Newark, by an\r\neloquent article on the one man who had laboured to retrieve the\r\nmiserable condition of the factory children, and ends with a taunting\r\nreminder to the reformers that this one man, Sadler,[57] was the nominee\r\nof a borough-monger, and that borough-monger the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n                             LONDON LIFE\r\n\r\nIt need not be said that his church-going never flagged. In 1840 his\r\nfriend, the elder Acland, interested himself in forming a small\r\nbrotherhood, with rules for systematic exercises of devotion and works\r\nof mercy. Mr. Gladstone was one of the number. The names were not\r\npublished, nor did any one but the treasurer know the amounts given. The\r\npledge to personal and active benevolence seems not to have been\r\nstrongly operative, for at the end of 1845 (Dec. 7) Mr. Gladstone writes\r\nto Hope in reference to Acland's scheme:--'The desire we then both felt\r\npassed off, as far as I am concerned, into a plan of asking only a\r\ndonation and subscription. Now it is very difficult to satisfy the\r\ndemands of duty to the poor by money alone. On the other hand, it is\r\nextremely hard for me--and I suppose possibly for you--to give them much\r\nin the shape of time and thought, for both with me are already tasked up\r\nto and beyond their powers.... I much wish we could execute some plan\r\nwhich without demanding much time would entail the discharge of some\r\nhumble and humbling office.... If you thought with me--and I do not see\r\nwhy you should not, except to assume the reverse is paying myself a\r\ncompliment--let us go to work, as in the young days of the college plan\r\nbut with a more direct and less ambitious purpose.' Of this we may see\r\nsomething later. At a great service at St. Paul's, he notes the glory\r\nalike of sight and sound as 'possessing that remarkable criterion of the\r\nsublime, a grand result from a combination of simple elements.' Edward\r\nIrving did not attract; 'a scene pregnant with melancholy instruction.'\r\nHe was immensely struck by Melvill, whom some of us have heard\r\npronounced by the generation before us to be the most puissant of all\r\nthe men in his calling. 'His sentiments,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'are manly\r\nin tone; he deals powerfully with all his subjects; his language is\r\nflowing and unbounded; his imagery varied and intensely strong. Vigorous\r\nand lofty as are his conceptions, he is not, I think, less remarkable\r\nfor soundness and healthiness of mind.' Such a passage shows among other\r\nthings how the diarist was already teaching himself to analyse the art\r\nof oratory. I may note one rather curious habit, no doubt practised with\r\na view to training in the art of speech. Besides listening to as many\r\nsermons as possible, he was also for a long time fond of reading them\r\naloud, especially Dr. Arnold's, in rather a peculiar way. 'My plan is,'\r\nhe says, 'to strengthen or qualify or omit expressions as I go along.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\n                              HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nIn an autobiographical note, written in the late days of his life, when\r\nhe had become the only commoner left who had sat in the old burned House\r\nof Commons, he says:--\r\n\r\n     I took my seat at the opening of 1833, provided unquestionably\r\n     with, a large stock of schoolboy bashfulness. The first time that\r\n     business required me to go to the arm of the chair to say something\r\n     to the Speaker, Manners Sutton--the first of seven whose subject I\r\n     have been--who was something of a Keate, I remember the revival in\r\n     me bodily of the frame of mind in which a schoolboy stands before\r\n     his master. But apart from an incidental recollection of this\r\n     kind, I found it most difficult to believe with, any reality of\r\n     belief, that such a poor and insignificant creature as I, could\r\n     really belong to, really form a _part_ of, an assembly which,\r\n     notwithstanding the prosaic character of its entire visible\r\n     equipment, I felt to be so august. What I may term its corporeal\r\n     conveniences were, I may observe in passing, marvellously small. I\r\n     do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means\r\n     of so much as washing the hands. The residences of members were at\r\n     that time less distant: but they were principally reached on foot.\r\n     When a large House broke up after a considerable division, a\r\n     copious dark stream found its way up Parliament Street, Whitehall,\r\n     and Charing Cross.\r\n\r\n     I remember that there occurred some case in which a constituent\r\n     (probably a maltster) at Newark sent me a communication which made\r\n     oral communication with the treasury, or with the chancellor of the\r\n     exchequer (then Lord Althorp), convenient. As to the means of\r\n     bringing this about, I was puzzled and abashed. Some experienced\r\n     friend on the opposition bench, probably Mr. Goulburn, said to me,\r\n     There is Lord Althorp sitting alone on the treasury bench, go to\r\n     him and tell him your business. With such encouragement I did it.\r\n     Lord Althorp received me in the kindest manner possible, alike to\r\n     my pleasure and my surprise.\r\n\r\nThe exact composition of the first reformed House of Commons was usually\r\nanalysed as tories 144; reformers 395; English and Scotch radicals 76;\r\nIrish repealers 43. Mr. Gladstone was for counting the decided\r\nconservatives as 160 and reckoning as a separate group a small party who\r\nhad once been tories and now ranked between conservative opposition and\r\nwhig ministers. The Irish representatives he divided between 28 tories,\r\nand a body of 50 who were made up of ministerialists, conditional\r\nrepealers, and tithe extinguishers. He heard Joseph Hume, the most\r\neffective of the leading radicals, get the first word in the reformed\r\nparliament, speaking for an hour and perhaps justifying O'Connell's\r\nwitty saying that Hume would have been an excellent speaker, if only he\r\nwould finish a sentence before beginning the next but one after it.\r\n\r\nNo more diligent member of parliament than Mr. Gladstone ever sat upon\r\nthe green benches. He read his blue-books, did his duty by election\r\ncommittees, and on the first occasion when, in consequence of staying a\r\nlittle too long at a dinner at the Duke of Hamilton's, he missed a\r\ndivision, his self-reproach was almost as sharp as if he had fallen into\r\nmortal sin. This is often enough the way with virtuous young members,\r\nbut Mr. Gladstone's zealous ideal of parliamentary duty lasted, and both\r\nat first and always he was a singular union of deep meditative\r\nseriousness with untiring animation, assiduity, and practical energy and\r\nforce working over a wide field definitely mapped.\r\n\r\n                             MAIDEN SPEECH\r\n\r\nIn the assembly where he was one day to rank among the most powerful\r\norators ever inscribed upon its golden roll, he first opened his lips in\r\na few words on a Newark petition (April 30) and shortly after (May 21)\r\nhe spoke two or three minutes on an Edinburgh petition. A little later\r\nthe question of slavery, where he knew every inch of the ground, brought\r\nhim to a serious ordeal. In May, Stanley as colonial secretary\r\nintroduced the proposals of the government for the gradual abolition of\r\ncolonial slavery. Abolition was to be preceded by an intermediate stage,\r\ndesignated as apprenticeship, to last for twelve years; and the planters\r\nwere to be helped through the difficulties of the transition by a loan\r\nof fifteen millions. In the course of the proceedings, the intermediate\r\nperiod was shortened from twelve years to seven, and the loan of fifteen\r\nmillions was transformed into a free gift of twenty. To this scheme John\r\nGladstone, whose indomitable energy made him the leading spirit of the\r\nWest Indian interest, was consistently opposed, and he naturally became\r\nthe mark of abolitionist attack. The occasion of Mr. Gladstone's first\r\nspeech was an attack by Lord Howick on the manager of John Gladstone's\r\nDemerara estates, whom he denounced as 'the murderer of slaves,'--an\r\nattack made without notice to the two sons of the incriminated\r\nproprietor sitting in front of him. He declared that the slaves on the\r\nVreedenhoop sugar plantations were systematically worked to death in\r\norder to increase the crop. Mr. Gladstone tried in vain to catch the eye\r\nof the Chairman on May 30, and the next day he wished to speak but saw\r\nno good opportunity. 'The emotions through which one passes, at least\r\nthrough which I pass, in anticipating such an effort as this, are\r\npainful and humiliating. The utter prostration and depression of spirit;\r\nthe deep sincerity, the burdensome and overpowering reality of the\r\nfeeling of mere feebleness and incapacity, felt in the inmost heart, yet\r\nnot to find relief by expression, because the expression of such things\r\ngoes for affectation,--these things I am unequal to describe, yet I have\r\nexperienced them now.' On June 3, the chance came. Here is his story of\r\nthe day: 'Began _le miei Prigioni_. West India meeting of members at one\r\nat Lord Sandon's. Resolutions discussed and agreed upon; ... dined\r\nearly. Re-arranged my notes for the debate. Rode. House 5 to 1. Spoke my\r\nfirst time, for 50 minutes. My leading desire was to benefit the cause\r\nof those who are now so sorely beset. The House heard me very kindly,\r\nand my friends were satisfied. Tea afterwards at the Carlton.' The\r\nspeech was an uncommon success. Stanley, the minister mainly concerned,\r\ncongratulated him with more than those conventional compliments which\r\nthe good nature of the House of Commons expects to be paid to any decent\r\nbeginner. 'I never listened to any speech with greater pleasure,' said\r\nStanley, himself the prince of debaters and then in the most brilliant\r\npart of his career; 'the member for Newark argued his case with a\r\ntemper, an ability, and a fairness which may well be cited as a good\r\nmodel to many older members of this House.' His own leader, though he\r\nspoke later, said nothing in his speech about the new recruit, but two\r\ndays after Mr. Gladstone mentioned that Sir R. Peel came up to him and\r\npraised Monday night's affair. King William wrote to Althorp: 'he\r\nrejoices that a young member has come forward in so promising a manner,\r\nas Viscount Althorp states Mr. W. E. Gladstone to have done.'[58]\r\n\r\nApart from its special vindication in close detail of the state of\r\nthings at Vreedenhoop as being no worse than others, the points of the\r\nspeech on this great issue of the time were familiar ones. He confessed\r\nwith shame and pain that cases of cruelty had existed, and would always\r\nexist, under the system of slavery, and that this was 'a substantial\r\nreason why the British legislature and public should set themselves in\r\ngood earnest to provide for its extinction.' He admitted, too, that we\r\nhad not fulfilled our Christian obligations by communicating the\r\ninestimable benefits of our religion to the slaves in our colonies, and\r\nthat the belief among the early English planters, that if you made a man\r\na Christian you could not keep him a slave, had led them to the\r\nmonstrous conclusion that they ought not to impart Christianity to their\r\nslaves. Its extinction was a consummation devoutly to be desired, and in\r\ngood earnest to be forwarded, but immediate and unconditioned\r\nemancipation, without a previous advance in character, must place the\r\nnegro in a state where he would be his own worst enemy, and so must\r\ncrown all the wrongs already done to him by cutting off the last hope of\r\nrising to a higher level in social existence. At some later period of\r\nhis life Mr. Gladstone read a corrected report of his first speech, and\r\nfound its tone much less than satisfactory. 'But of course,' he adds,\r\n'allowance must be made for the enormous and most blessed change of\r\nopinion since that day on the subject of negro slavery. I must say,\r\nhowever, that even before this time I had come to entertain little or no\r\nconfidence in the proceedings of the resident agents in the West\r\nIndies.' 'I can now see plainly enough,' he said sixty years later, 'the\r\nsad defects, the real illiberalism of my opinions on that subject. Yet\r\nthey were not illiberal as compared with the ideas of the times, and as\r\ndeclared in parliament in 1833 they obtained the commendation of the\r\nliberal leaders.'\r\n\r\n                       COMMON OPINIONS ON SLAVERY\r\n\r\nIt is fair to remember that Pitt, Fox, Grenville, and Grey, while eager\r\nto bring the slave trade to an instant end, habitually disclaimed as a\r\ncalumny any intention of emancipating the blacks on the sugar islands.\r\nIn 1807, when the foul blot of the trade was abolished, even Wilberforce\r\nhimself discouraged attempts to abolish slavery, though the noble\r\nphilanthropist soon advanced to the full length of his own principles.\r\nPeel in 1833 would have nothing to do with either immediate emancipation\r\nor gradual. Disraeli has put his view on deliberate record that 'the\r\nmovement of the middle class for the abolition of slavery was virtuous,\r\nbut it was not wise. It was an ignorant movement. The history of the\r\nabolition of slavery by the English, and its consequences, would be a\r\nnarrative of ignorance, injustice, blundering, waste, and havoc, not\r\neasily paralleled in the history of mankind.'[59]\r\n\r\nA week later Lord Howick proposed to move for papers relating to\r\nVreedenhoop. Lord Althorp did not refuse to grant them, but recommended\r\nhim to drop his motion, as Mr. Gladstone insisted on the equal necessity\r\nof a similar return for all neighbouring plantations. Howick withdrew\r\nhis motion, though he afterwards asserted that ministers had declined\r\nthe return, which was not true. When Buxton moved to reduce the term of\r\napprenticeship, Mr. Gladstone voted against him. On the following day\r\nStanley, without previous intimation, announced the change from twelve\r\nyears to seven. 'I spoke a few sentences,' Mr. Gladstone enters in his\r\ndiary, 'in much confusion: for I could not easily recover from the\r\nsensation caused by the sudden overthrow of an entire and undoubting\r\nalliance.'\r\n\r\nThe question of electoral scandals at Liverpool, which naturally excited\r\nlively interest in a family with local ties so strong, came up in\r\nvarious forms during the session, and on one of these occasions (July 4)\r\nMr. Gladstone spoke upon it, 'for twenty minutes or more, anything but\r\nsatisfactorily to myself.' Nor can the speech now be called satisfactory\r\nby any one else, except for the enunciation of the sound maxim that the\r\ngiver of a bribe deserves punishment quite as richly as the receiver.\r\nFour days later he spoke for something less than half an hour on the\r\nthird reading of the Irish Church Reform bill. 'I was heard,' he tells\r\nhis father, 'with kindness and indulgence, but it is, after all, uphill\r\nwork to address an assembly so much estranged in feeling from one's\r\nself.' Peel's speech was described as temporising, and the deliverance\r\nof his young lieutenant was temporising too, though firm on the\r\nnecessary principle, as he called it, of which the world was before long\r\nto hear so much from him, that the nation should be taxed for the\r\nsupport of a national church.\r\n\r\nBesides his speeches he gave a full number of party votes, some of them\r\ninteresting enough in view of the vast career before him. I think the\r\nfirst of them all was in the majority of 428 against 40 upon O'Connell's\r\namendment for repeal,--an occasion that came vividly to his memory on\r\nthe eve of his momentous change of policy in 1886. He voted for the\r\nworst clauses of the Irish Coercion bill, including the court-martial\r\nclause. He fought steadily against the admission of Jews to parliament.\r\nHe fought against the admission of dissenters without a test to the\r\nuniversities, which he described as seminaries for the established\r\nchurch. He supported the existing corn law. He said 'No' to the property\r\ntax and 'Aye' for retaining the house and window taxes. He resisted a\r\nmotion of Hume's for the abolition of military and naval sinecures\r\n(February 14), and another motion of the same excellent man's for the\r\nabolition of all flogging in the army save for mutiny and drunkenness.\r\nHe voted against the publication of the division lists. He voted with\r\nministers both against shorter parliaments and (April 25) against the\r\nballot, a cardinal reform carried by his own government forty years\r\nlater. On the other hand he voted (July 5) with Lord Ashley against\r\npostponing his beneficent policy of factory legislation; but he did not\r\nvote either way a fortnight later when Althorp sensibly reduced the\r\nlimit of ten hours' work in factories from the impracticable age of\r\neighteen proposed by Ashley, to the age of thirteen. He supported a bill\r\nagainst work on Sundays.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     V\r\n\r\n                            PURCHASE OF FASQUE\r\n\r\nA page or two from his diary will carry us succinctly enough over the\r\nrest of the first and second years of his parliamentary life.\r\n\r\n     _July 21, 1833, Sunday._-- ...

Finished Tasso,\r\n     canto 1. Anti-slavery observations on bill. German vocabulary and\r\n     exercise. _August 16._--23/4-31/2 Committee finished. German lesson.\r\n     Finished Plato, _Republic_, bk. v. Preparing to pack. _August_\r\n     17.--Started for Aberdeen on board _Queen of Scotland_ at 12.\r\n     _August 18th._--Rose to breakfast, but uneasily. Attempted reading,\r\n     and read most of Baxter's narrative. Not too unwell to reflect.\r\n     _August 19th._--Remained in bed. Read Goethe and translated a few\r\n     lines. Also _Beauties of Shakespeare_. In the evening it blew: very\r\n     ill though in bed. Could not help admiring the crests of the waves\r\n     even as I stood at cabin window. _August 20._--Arrived 81/2 A.M.--561/2\r\n     hours.\r\n\r\nHis father met him, and in the evening he and his brother found\r\nthemselves at the new paternal seat. In 1829 John Gladstone, after much\r\nnegotiation, had bought the estate of Fasque in Kincardineshire for,\r\nL80,000, to which and to other Scotch affairs he devoted his special and\r\npersonal attention pretty exclusively. The home at Seaforth was broken\r\nup, though relatives remained there or in the neighbourhood. For some\r\ntime he had a house in Edinburgh for private residence--the centre house\r\nin Atholl Crescent. They used for three or four years to come in from\r\nKincardineshire, and spend the winter months in Edinburgh. Fasque was\r\nhis home for the rest of his days. This was W. E. Gladstone's first\r\nvisit, followed by at least one long annual spell for the remaining\r\neighteen years of his father's life.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his arrival, he notes, 'I rode to the mill of Kincairn\r\nto see Mackay who was shot last night. He was suffering much and seemed\r\nnear death. Read the Holy Scriptures to him (Psalms 51, 69, 71, Isaiah\r\n55, Joh. 14, Col. 3). Left my prayer book.' The visit was repeated daily\r\nuntil the poor man's death a week later. Apart from such calls of duty,\r\nbooks are his main interest. He is greatly delighted with Hamilton's\r\n_Men and Manners in America_. Alfieri's _Antigone_ he dislikes as having\r\nthe faults of both ancient and modern drama. He grinds away through\r\nGifford's _Pitt_, and reads Hallam's _Middle Ages_. 'My method has\r\nusually been, 1, to read over regularly; 2, to glance again over all I\r\nhave read, and analyse.' He was just as little of the lounger in his\r\nlighter reading. Schiller's plays he went through with attention,\r\nfinding it 'a good plan to read along with history, historical plays of\r\nthe same events for material illustration, as well as aid to the\r\nmemory.' He read Scott's chapters on Mary Stuart in his history of\r\nScotland, 'to enable me better to appreciate the admirable judgment of\r\nSchiller (in _Maria Stuart_) both where he has adhered to history and\r\nwhere he has gone beyond it.' He finds fault with the _Temistocle_ of\r\nMetastasio, as 'too humane.' 'History should not be violated without a\r\nreason. It may be set aside to fill up poetical verisimilitude. If\r\nhistory assigns a cause inadequate to its effect, or an effect\r\ninadequate to its cause, poetry may supply the deficiency for the sake\r\nof an impressive whole. But it is too much to overset a narrative and\r\ncall it a historical play.' Then came a tragic stroke in real life.\r\n\r\n                           DAYS IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n     _October 6, 1833._--Post hour to-day brought me a melancholy\r\n     announcement--the death of Arthur Hallam. This intelligence was\r\n     deeply oppressive even to my selfish disposition. I mourn in him,\r\n     for myself, my earliest near friend; for my fellow creatures, one\r\n     who would have adorned his age and country, a mind full of beauty\r\n     and of power, attaining almost to that ideal standard of which it\r\n     is presumption to expect an example. When shall I see his like? Yet\r\n     this dispensation is not all pain, for there is a hope and not (in\r\n     my mind) a bare or rash hope that his soul rests with God in Jesus\r\n     Christ.... I walked upon the hills to muse upon this very mournful\r\n     event, which cuts me to the heart. Alas for his family and his\r\n     intended bride. _October 7th._--My usual occupations, but not\r\n     without many thoughts upon my departed friend. Bible. Alfieri,\r\n     _Wallenstein_, Plato, Gifford's _Pitt_, _Biographia Literaria_.\r\n     Rode with my father and Helen. All objects lay deep in the softness\r\n     and solemnity of autumnal decay. Alas, my poor friend was cut off\r\n     in the spring of his bright existence.\r\n\r\n     _December 13, Edinburgh._--Breakfast with Dr. Chalmers. His\r\n     modesty is so extreme that it is oppressive to those who are in his\r\n     company, especially his juniors, since it is impossible for them to\r\n     keep their behaviour in due proportion to his. He was on his own\r\n     subject, the Poor Laws, very eloquent, earnest, and impressive.\r\n     Perhaps he may have been hasty in applying maxims drawn from\r\n     Scotland to a more advanced stage of society in England. _December\r\n     17._--Robertson's _Charles V._, Plato, began book 10. Chalmers.\r\n     Singing-lesson and practice. Whist. Walked on the Glasgow road,\r\n     first milestone to fourth and back in 70 minutes--the returning\r\n     three miles in about 333/4. Ground in some places rather muddy and\r\n     slippery. _December 26._--A feeble day. Three successive callers\r\n     and conversation with my father occupied the morning. Read a good\r\n     allowance of Robertson, an historian _who leads his reader on_, I\r\n     think, more pleasantly than any I know. The style most attractive,\r\n     but the mind of the writer does not set forth the loftiest\r\n     principles. _December 29th, Sunday._--Twenty-four years have I\r\n     lived.... Where is the _continuous_ work which ought to fill up the\r\n     life of a Christian without intermission?... I have been growing,\r\n     that is certain; in good or evil? Much fluctuation; often a\r\n     supposed progress, terminating in finding myself at, or short of,\r\n     the point which I deemed I had left behind me. Business and\r\n     political excitement a tremendous trial, not so much alleviating as\r\n     forcibly dragging down the soul from that temper which is fit to\r\n     inhale the air of heaven. _Jan. 8, 1834, Edinburgh._--Breakfast\r\n     with Dr. Chalmers. Attended his lecture 2-3.... More than ever\r\n     struck with the superabundance of Dr. C.'s gorgeous language, which\r\n     leads him into repetitions, until the stores of our tongue be\r\n     exhausted on each particular point. Yet the variety and\r\n     magnificence of his expositions must fix them very strongly in the\r\n     minds of his hearers. In ordinary works great attention would be\r\n     excited by the very infrequent occurrence of the very brilliant\r\n     expressions and illustrations with which he cloys the palate. His\r\n     gems lie like paving stones. He does indeed seem to be an\r\n     _admirable_ man.\r\n\r\nOf Edinburgh his knowledge soon became intimate. His father and mother\r\ntook him to that city, as we have seen, in 1814. He spent a spring there\r\nin 1828 just before going to Oxford, and he recollected to the end of\r\nhis life a sermon of Dr. Andrew Thomson's on the Repentance of Judas, 'a\r\ngreat and striking subject.' Some circumstance or another brought him\r\ninto relations with Chalmers, that ripened into friendship. 'We used to\r\nhave walks together,' Mr. Gladstone remembered, 'chiefly out of the town\r\nby the Dean Bridge and along the Queensferry road. On one of our walks\r\ntogether, Chalmers took me down to see one of his districts by the water\r\nof Leith, and I remember we went into one or more of the cottages. He\r\nwent in with smiling countenance, greeting and being greeted by the\r\npeople, and sat down. But he had nothing to say. He was exactly like the\r\nDuke of Wellington, who said of himself that he had no small talk. His\r\nwhole mind was always full of some great subject and he could not\r\ndeviate from it. He sat smiling among the people, but he had no small\r\ntalk for them and they had no large talk. So after some time we came\r\naway, he pleased to have been with the people, and they proud to have\r\nhad the Doctor with them.[60] For Chalmers he never lost a warm\r\nappreciation, often expressed in admirable words--'one of nature's\r\nnobles; his warrior grandeur, his rich and glowing eloquence, his\r\nabsorbed and absorbing earnestness, above all his singular simplicity\r\nand detachment from the world.' Among other memories, 'There was a\r\nquaint old shop at the Bowhead which used to interest me very much. It\r\nwas kept by a bookseller, Mr. Thomas Nelson. I remember being amused by\r\na reply he made to me one day when I went in and asked for Booth's\r\n_Reign of Grace_. He half turned his head towards me, and remarked with\r\na peculiar twinkle in his eye, \"Ay, man, but ye're a young chiel to be\r\naskin' after a book like that.\"'\r\n\r\n                        RELATIONS WITH CHALMERS\r\n\r\nOn his way south in January 1834, Mr. Gladstone stays with relatives at\r\nSeaforth, 'where even the wind howling upon the window at night was dear\r\nand familiar;' and a few days later finds himself once more within the\r\never congenial walls of Oxford.\r\n\r\n     _January 19, Sunday._--Read the first lesson in morning chapel. A\r\n     most masterly sermon of Pusey's preached by Clarke. Lancaster in\r\n     the afternoon on the Sacrament. Good walk. Wrote [family letters].\r\n     Read Whyte. Three of Girdlestone's Sermons. Pickering on adult\r\n     baptism (some clever and singularly insufficient reasoning).\r\n     Episcopal pastoral letter for 1832. Doane's Ordination sermon,\r\n     1833, admirable,--Wrote some thoughts. _Jan. 20._--Sismondi's\r\n     _Italian Republics_. Dined at Merton, and spent all the evening\r\n     there in interesting conversation. I was Hamilton's guest\r\n     [afterwards Bishop of Salisbury]. It was delightful, it wrings joy\r\n     even from the most unfeeling heart, to see religion on the increase\r\n     as it is here. _Jan. 23rd._--Much of to-day, it fell out, spent in\r\n     conversation of an interesting kind, with Brandreth and Pearson on\r\n     eternal punishment; with Williams on baptism; with Churton on faith\r\n     and religion in the university; with Harrison on prophecy and the\r\n     papacy.... _Jan. 24._--Began _Essay on Saving Faith_, and wrote\r\n     thereon. _Jan. 29th._--Dined at Oriel. Conversation with Newman\r\n     chiefly on church matters.... I excuse some idleness to myself by\r\n     the fear of doing some real injury to my eyes. [After a flight of\r\n     three or four days to London, he again returns for a Sunday in\r\n     Oxford.] _Feb. 9._--Two university sermons and St. Peter's. Round\r\n     the meadows with Williams. Dined with him, common room. Tea and a\r\n     pleasant conversation with Harrison. Began _Chrysostom de\r\n     Sacerdotio_, and Cecil's _Friendly Visit_. [Then he goes back to\r\n     town for the rest of the session.] _Feb. 12, London._--Finished\r\n     _Friendly Visit_, beautiful little book. Finished Tennyson's poems.\r\n     Wrote a paper on [Greek: ethike pistis] in poetry. Recollections of Robert\r\n     Hall. _13th._--With Doyle, long and solemn conversation on the\r\n     doctrine of the Trinity.... Began Wardlaw's _Christian Ethics._\r\n     _26th, London._--A busy day, yet of little palpable profit.... Read\r\n     two important Demerara papers.... Rode. At the levee. House 51/2 -\r\n     11. Wished to speak, but deterred by the extremely ill disposition\r\n     to hear. Much sickened by their unfairness in the judicial\r\n     character, more still at my own wretched feebleness and fears.\r\n     _April 1._--Dined at Sir R. Peel's. Herries, Sir G. Murray,\r\n     Chantrey, etc. Sir R. Peel very kind in his manner to us. _May\r\n     29._--Mignet's _Introduction_ [to 'the History of the Spanish\r\n     succession,' one of the masterpieces of historical literature].\r\n     _June 4._--Bruce to breakfast. Paper. Mignet and analysis. Burke.\r\n     Harvey committee.[61] Ancient music concert. Dined at Lincoln's\r\n     Inn. House 111/4-123/4. Rode. _June 6._--_Paradise Lost._ Began\r\n     Leibnitz's _Tentamina Theodiceae_. _June 11._--Read Pitt's speeches\r\n     on the Union in January, 1799, and Grattan on Catholic petition in\r\n     1805. _15th._--Read some passages in the latter part of _Corinne_,\r\n     which always work strongly on me. _18th._--Coming home to dine,\r\n     found _Remains of A. H. H._ Yesterday a bridal at a friend's, to-day\r\n     a sad memorial of death. 'Tis a sad subject, a very sad one to me.\r\n     I have not seen his like. The memory of him reposes gently in my\r\n     inmost heart, a fountain of tears which soften and fertilise it in\r\n     the midst of pursuits whose tendency is to dry up the sources of\r\n     emotion by the fever of excitement. I read his memoir. His father\r\n     had done me much and undeserved kindness there. _20th._--Most of my\r\n     time went in thinking confusedly over the university question. Very\r\n     anxious to speak, tortured with nervous anticipations; could not\r\n     get an opportunity. Certainly my inward experience on these\r\n     occasions ought to make me humble. Herbert's maiden speech very\r\n     successful. I ought to be thankful for my _miss_; perhaps also\r\n     because my mind was so much oppressed that I could not, I fear,\r\n     have unfolded my inward convictions. What a world it is, and how\r\n     does it require the Divine power and aid to clothe in words the\r\n     profound and mysterious thoughts on those subjects most connected\r\n     with the human soul--thoughts which the mind does not command as a\r\n     mistress, but entertains reverentially as honoured guests ...\r\n     content with only a partial comprehension, hoping to render it a\r\n     progressive one, but how difficult to define in words a conception,\r\n     many of whose parts are still in a nascent state with no fixed\r\n     outline or palpable substance. _July 2._-- ... Guizot. Cousin.\r\n     Bossuet (_Hist. Univ._). Rode. Committee and House. Curious detail\r\n     from O'Connell of his interview with Littleton. _10th._--71/4 A.M.-71/2\r\n     in an open chaise to Coggeshall and back with O'Connell and Sir G.\r\n     Sinclair, to examine Skingley [a proceeding arising from the Harvey\r\n     committee], which was done with little success.\r\n\r\n                         THE UNIVERSITY QUESTION\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the great Liberator was never wholly forgotten, and\r\nit was probably his earliest chance of a glimpse of the Irish point of\r\nview at first hand.\r\n\r\n     _July 11._--No news till the afternoon and then heard on very good\r\n     authority that the Grey government is definitely broken up, and\r\n     that attempts at reconstruction have failed. Cousin, Sismondi,\r\n     Education evidence. Letters. House. _21st._--To-day not for the\r\n     first time felt a great want of courage to express feelings\r\n     strongly awakened on hearing a speech of O'Connell. To have so\r\n     strong an impulse and not obey it seems unnatural; it seems like an\r\n     inflicted dumbness. _28th._--Spoke 30 to 35 minutes on University\r\n     bill, with more ease than I had hoped, having been more mindful or\r\n     less unmindful of Divine aid. Divided in 75 v. 164. [To his father\r\n     next day.] You will see by your _Post_ that I held forth last night\r\n     on the Universities bill. The House I am glad to say heard me with\r\n     the utmost kindness, for they had been listening previously to an\r\n     Indian discussion in which very few people took any interest,\r\n     though indeed it was both curious and interesting. But the change\r\n     of subject was no doubt felt as a relief, and their disposition to\r\n     listen set me infinitely more at my ease than I should otherwise\r\n     have been. _29th._--Pleasant house dinner at Carlton. Lincoln got\r\n     up the party. Sir R. Peel was in good spirits and very agreeable.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that he wrote to his mother,--'Sir Robert Peel\r\ncaused me much gratification by the way in which he spoke to me of my\r\nspeech, and particularly the great warmth of his manner. He told me he\r\ncheered me loudly, and I said in return that I had heard his voice under\r\nme while speaking, and was much encouraged thereby.' He ends the note\r\nalready cited (Sept. 6, 1897) on the old House of Commons, which was\r\nburned down this year, with what he calls a curious incident concerning\r\nSir Robert Peel, and with a sentence or two upon the government of Lord\r\nGrey:--\r\n\r\n     Cobbett made a motion alike wordy and absurd, praying the king to\r\n     remove him [Peel] from the privy council as the author of the act\r\n     for the re-establishment of the gold standard in 1819. The entire\r\n     House was against him, except his colleague Fielden of Oldham, who\r\n     made a second teller.[62] After the division I think Lord Althorp\r\n     at once rose and moved the expunction of the proceedings from the\r\n     votes or journals; a severe rebuke to the mover. Sir Robert in his\r\n     speech said, 'I am at a loss, sir, to conceive what can be the\r\n     cause of the strong hostility to me which the honourable gentleman\r\n     exhibits. _I_ never conferred on him an obligation.' This stroke\r\n     was not original. But what struck me at the time as singular was\r\n     this, that notwithstanding the state of feeling which I have\r\n     described, Sir R. Peel was greatly excited in dealing with one who\r\n     at the time was little more than a contemptible antagonist. At that\r\n     period shirt collars were made with 'gills' which came up upon the\r\n     cheek; and Peel's gills were so soaked with perspiration that they\r\n     actually lay down upon his neck-cloth.\r\n\r\n     In one of these years, I think 1833, a motion was made by some\r\n     political economist for the abolition of the corn laws. I (an\r\n     absolute and literal ignoramus) was much struck and staggered with\r\n     it. But Sir James Graham--who knew more of economic and trade\r\n     matters, I think, than the rest of the cabinet of 1841 all put\r\n     together--made a reply in the sense of protection, whether high or\r\n     low I cannot now say. But I remember perfectly well that this\r\n     speech of his built me up again for the moment and enabled me (I\r\n     believe) to vote with the government.\r\n\r\n                     A YEAR OF SPLENDID LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n     The year 1833 was, as measured by quantity and in part by quality,\r\n     a splendid year of legislation. In 1834 the Government and Lord\r\n     Althorp far beyond all others did themselves high honour by the new\r\n     Poor Law Act, which rescued the English peasantry from the total\r\n     loss of their independence. Of the 658 members of Parliament about\r\n     480 must have been their general supporters. Much gratitude ought\r\n     to have been felt for this great administration. But from a variety\r\n     of causes, at the close of the session 1834 the House of Commons\r\n     had fallen into a state of cold indifference about it.\r\n\r\nHe was himself destined one day to feel how soon parliamentary reaction\r\nmay follow a sweeping popular triumph.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] Sir Henry James's Act (1883).\r\n\r\n[55] Thuc. i. 84, Sec. 7.--'We should remember that man differs little from\r\nman, except that he turns out best who is trained in the sharpest\r\nschool.'\r\n\r\n[56] Proposed by Sir R.

If by adopting the spirit of the\r\n     Reform bill it be meant that we are to live in a perpetual vortex\r\n     of agitation; that public men can only support themselves in public\r\n     estimation by adopting every popular impression of the day, by\r\n     promising the instant redress of anything that anybody may call an\r\n     abuse ... I will not undertake to adopt it. But if the spirit of\r\n     the Reform bill implies merely a careful review of institutions\r\n     civil and ecclesiastical, undertaken in a friendly temper, the\r\n     correction of proved abuses and the redress of real grievances,\r\n     then, etc. etc.--PEEL (_Tamworth Address_).\r\n\r\n                        MISCELLANEOUS READING\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1834 was spent at Fasque. An observant eye followed\r\npolitical affairs, but hardly a word is said about them in the diary. A\r\nstiff battle was kept up against electioneering iniquities at Newark.\r\nRiding, boating, shooting were Mr. Gladstone's pastimes in the day;\r\nbilliards, singing, backgammon, and a rubber in the evening. Sport was\r\nnot without compunction which might well, in an age that counts itself\r\nhumane, be expected to come oftener. 'Had to kill a wounded partridge,'\r\nhe records, 'and felt after it as if I had shot the albatross. It might\r\nbe said: This should be more or less.' And that was true. He was always\r\na great walker. He walked from Montrose, some thirteen or fourteen miles\r\noff, in two hours and three quarters, and another time he does six miles\r\nin seventy minutes. Nor does he ever walk with an unobserving mind. At\r\nLochnagar: 'Saw Highland women from Strathspey coming down for harvest\r\nwith heavy loads, some with babies, over these wild rough paths through\r\nwind and storm. Ah, with what labour does a large portion of mankind\r\nsubsist, while we fare sumptuously every day!' This was the ready\r\nsusceptibility to humane impression in the common circumstance of life,\r\nthe eye stirring the emotions of the feeling heart, that nourished in\r\nhim the soul of true oratory, to say nothing of feeding the roots of\r\nstatesmanship. His bookmindedness is unabated. He began with a\r\nresolution to work at least two hours every morning before breakfast,\r\nand the resolution seems to have been manfully kept, without prejudice\r\nto systematic reading for a good many hours of the day besides. For the\r\nfirst time, rather strange to say, he read St. Augustine's\r\n_Confessions_, and with the delight that might have been expected. He\r\nfinds in that famous composition 'a good deal of prolix and fanciful,\r\nthough acute speculation, but the practical parts of the book have a\r\nwonderful force, and inimitable sweetness and simplicity.' In other\r\ndepartments of religion, he read Archbishop Leighton's life and Hannah\r\nMore's, Arnold's Sermons and Milner's _Church History_ and Whewells\r\n_Bridgewater Treatise_. Once more he analyses the _Novum Organum_ and\r\nthe _Advancement of Learning_, and he reads or re-reads Locke's _Essay_.\r\nHe studies political science in the two great manuals of the old world\r\nand the new, in the _Politics_ of Aristotle and the _Prince_ of\r\nMachiavelli. He goes through three or four plays of Schiller; also\r\nManzoni, and Petrarch, and Dante at the patient rate of a couple of\r\ncantos a day; then Boccaccio, from whom, after a half-dozen of the days,\r\nhe willingly parts company, only interested in him as showing a strange\r\nstate of manners and how religion can be dissociated from conduct. In\r\nmodern politics he reads the memoirs of Chatham, and Brougham on\r\nColonial Policy, of which he says that 'eccentricity, paradox, fast and\r\nloose reasoning and (much more) sentiment, appear to have entered most\r\ndeeply into the essence of this remarkable man when he wrote his\r\nColonial Policy, as now; with the rarest power of _expressing_ his\r\nthoughts, has he any fixed law to guide them?' On Roscoe's _Leo X._ he\r\nremarks how interesting and highly agreeable it is in style, and while\r\ndisclaiming any right to judge its fidelity and research, makes the odd\r\nobservation that it has in some degree subdued the leaven of its\r\nauthor's unitarianism. He writes occasional verses, including the\r\ncompletion of 'some stanzas of December 1832 on \"The Human Heart,\" but I\r\nam not impudent enough to call them by that name.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of days well filled by warm home feeling, reasonable\r\npleasure, and vigorous animation of intellect came the summons to\r\naction. On November 18, a guest arrived with the astonishing news that\r\nministers were out. The king had dismissed the Melbourne government,\r\npartly because he did not believe that Lord John Russell could take the\r\nplace of Althorp as leader of the Commons, partly because like many\r\ncleverer judges he was sick of them, and partly because, as is perhaps\r\nthe case with more cabinets than the world supposes, the ministers were\r\nsick of one another, and King William knew it. Mr. Gladstone in 1875[63]\r\ndescribed the dismissal of the whigs in 1834 as the indiscreet\r\nproceeding of an honest and well-meaning man, which gave the\r\nconservatives a momentary tenure of office without power, but provoked a\r\nstrong reaction in favour of the liberals, and greatly prolonged the\r\npredominance which they were on the point of losing through the play of\r\nnatural causes.[64] Sir Robert Peel was summoned in hot haste from Rome,\r\nand after a journey of twelve days over alpine snows, eight nights out\r\nof the twelve in a carriage, on December 9 he reached London, saw the\r\nking and kissed hands as first lord of the treasury. Less than two years\r\nbefore, he had said, 'I feel that between me and office there is a wider\r\ngulf than there is perhaps between it and any other man in the House.'\r\n\r\n                         PROPOSAL OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone meanwhile at Fasque worked off some of his natural\r\nexcitement which he notes as invading even Sundays, by the composition\r\nof a political tract. The tract has disappeared down the gulf of time.\r\nDecember 11 was his father's seventieth birthday, 'his strength and\r\nenergy wonderful and giving promise of many more.' Within the week the\r\nfated message from the new prime minister arrived; the case is apt to\r\nquicken the pulse of even the most serene of politicians, and we may be\r\nsure that Mr. Gladstone with the keen vigour of five-and-twenty tingling\r\nin his veins was something more or less than serene.\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 17._--Locke, and Russell's _Modern Europe_ in the morning.\r\n     Went to meet the post, found a letter from Peel desiring to see me,\r\n     dated 13th. All haste; ready by 4--no place! Reluctantly deferred\r\n     till the morning. Wrote to Lincoln, Sir R. Peel, etc.... A game of\r\n     whist. This is a serious call. I got my father's advice to take\r\n     anything with work and responsibility. _18th._--Off at 7.40 by\r\n     mail. I find it a privation to be unable to read in a coach. The\r\n     mind is distracted through the senses, and rambles. Nowhere is it\r\n     to me so incapable of continuous thought.... Newcastle at 91/4 P.M.\r\n     _19th._--Same again. At York at 61/4 A.M. to 7. Ran to peep at the\r\n     minster and bore away a faint twilight image of its grandeur.\r\n     _20th._--Arrived safe, thank God, and well at the Bull and Mouth 53/4\r\n     A.M. Albany soon. To bed for 21/4 hours. Went to Peel about eleven.\r\n\r\nHe writes to his father the same day--\r\n\r\n     My interview with him was not more than six or eight minutes, but\r\n     he was _extremely_ kind. He told me his letter to me was among his\r\n     first; that he was prompted only by his own feelings towards me and\r\n     some more of that kind; that I might have a seat either at the\r\n     admiralty or treasury boards, but the latter was that which he\r\n     intended for me; that I should then be in immediate and\r\n     confidential communication with himself; and should thereby have\r\n     more insight into the general concerns of government; that there\r\n     was a person very anxious for the seat at the treasury, who would\r\n     go to the admiralty if I did not; but that he meant to go upon the\r\n     principle of putting every one to the post for which he thought\r\n     them most fit, so far as he could, and therefore preferred the\r\n     arrangement he had named. As he distinctly preferred the treasury\r\n     for me, and assigned such reasons for the preference, it appeared\r\n     to me that the question was quite settled, and I immediately closed\r\n     with his offer. I expressed my gratitude for the opinions of me\r\n     which he had expressed; and said I thought it my duty to mention\r\n     that the question of my re-election at Newark upon a single\r\n     vacancy had never been put to my friends, and I asked whether I\r\n     should consider any part of what he had said as contingent upon the\r\n     answer I might receive from them. He said no, that he would\r\n     willingly take that risk. At first, he thought I had suspicions\r\n     about the Duke of Newcastle, and assured me that he would be much\r\n     pleased, of which I said I felt quite persuaded. This inquiry,\r\n     however, served the double purpose of discharging my own duty, and\r\n     drawing out something about the dissolution. He said to me, 'You\r\n     will address your constituents upon vacating your seat, and\r\n     acquaint them of your intention to solicit a renewal of their\r\n     confidence whenever they are called upon to exercise their\r\n     franchise, _which I tell you confidentially_,' he added, 'will be\r\n     very soon.' I would have given a hundred pounds to be then and\r\n     there in a position to express my hopes and fears! But it is, then,\r\n     you see _certain_ that we are to have it, and that they will not\r\n     meet the present parliament. Most bitterly do I lament it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone at a later date (July 25, 1835) recorded that he had\r\nreason to believe from a conversation with a tory friend who was in many\r\nparty secrets, that the Duke of Wellington set their candidates in\r\nmotion all over the country before Sir Robert's return. Active measures,\r\nand of course expense, had so generally begun, so much impatience for\r\nthe dissolution had been excited, and the anticipations had been\r\npermitted for so long a time to continue and to spread, as to preclude\r\nthe possibility of delay.[65]\r\n\r\n                       SECOND ELECTION AT NEWARK\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the young member for Newark was noted at the time as\r\nan innovation upon a semi-sacred social usage. Sir Robert Inglis said to\r\nhim, 'You are about the youngest lord who was ever placed at the\r\ntreasury on his own account, and not because he was his father's son.'\r\nThe prime minister, no doubt, rejoiced in finding for the public service\r\na young man of this high promise, sprung out of the same class, and bred\r\nin the same academic traditions as his own.[66] The youthful minister's\r\npath was happily smoothed at Newark. This time blues and reds called a\r\ngrand truce, divided the honours, and returned Mr. Gladstone and\r\nSergeant Wilde without a contest. The question that excited most\r\ninterest in the canvass was the new poor law. Mr. Gladstone gave the\r\nfallen ministers full credit for their measure. Most of their bills, he\r\nsaid, were projected from a mere craving for popularity, but in the case\r\nof the poor law they acted in defiance of the public press and many of\r\ntheir own friends. On the other hand, he defended the new government as\r\nthe government of a truly reforming party, pointing to the commercial\r\nchanges made by Lord Liverpool's administration, to the corporation and\r\ntest Acts, and to catholic emancipation. Who could deny that these were\r\nchanges of magnitude settled in peaceful times by a parliament\r\nunreformed? Who could deny that Sir Robert Peel had long been a\r\npractical reformer of the law, and that the Duke of Wellington had\r\ncarried out great retrenchments? Let them then rally round throne and\r\naltar, and resist the wild measures of the destructives. The red hero\r\nwas drawn through the town by six greys, with postilions in silk\r\njackets, amid the music of bands, the clash of bells, and the cheers of\r\nthe crowd. When the red procession met the blue, mutual congratulations\r\ntook the place of the old insult and defiance, and at five o'clock each\r\nparty sat down to its own feast. The reds drank toasts of a spirited,\r\nloyal, and constitutional character, many admirable speeches were made\r\nwhich the chronicler regrets that his limits will not allow him to\r\nreport,--regrets unshared by us,--and soon after eleven Mr. Gladstone\r\nescaped. After a day at Clumber, he was speedily on his way to London.\r\n'Off at 101/2 P.M. Missed the High Flyer at Tuxford, broke down in my\r\nchaise on the way to Newark; no injury, thanks to God. Remained 21/2 hours\r\nalone; overtaken by the Wellington at 31/2 A.M. Arrived in London (Jan.\r\n8) before 8 P.M. Good travelling.' On reckoning up his movements he\r\nfinds that, though not at all fond of travelling for the sake of going\r\nfrom place to place, he has had in 1834 quite 2400 miles of it.\r\n\r\nBefore the dissolution, Sir H. Hardinge had told him that the\r\nconservatives would not be over 340 nor under 300, but by the middle of\r\nthe month things looked less prosperous. The reaction against the whigs\r\nhad not yet reached full flood, the royal dismissal of the\r\nadministration was unpopular, moderate people more especially in\r\nScotland could not stand a government where the Duke of Wellington, the\r\nsymbol of a benighted and stubborn toryism, was seen over Peel's\r\nshoulder. 'At present,' Mr. Gladstone writes, 'the case is, even in my\r\nview, hopeful; in that of most here it is more. And certainly, to have\r\nthis very privilege of entertaining a deliberate and reasonable hope, to\r\nthink that notwithstanding the ten pound clause, a moderate parliament\r\nmay be returned; in fine, to believe that we have now _some_ prospect of\r\nsurviving the Reform bill without a bloody revolution, is to me as\r\nsurprising as delightful; it seems to me the greatest and most\r\nprovidential mercy with which a nation was ever visited.... To-day I am\r\ngoing to dine with the lord chancellor [Lyndhurst], having received a\r\ncard to that effect last night.'\r\n\r\nIt was at this dinner that Mr. Gladstone had his first opportunity of\r\nmaking a remarkable acquaintance. In his diary he mentions as present\r\nthree of the judges, the flower of the bench, as he supposes, but he\r\nsays not a word of the man of the strangest destiny there, the author of\r\n_Vivian Grey_. Disraeli himself, in a letter to his sister, names 'young\r\nGladstone,' and others, but condemns the feast as rather dull, and\r\ndeclares that a swan very white and tender, and stuffed with truffles,\r\nwas the best company at the table. What Mr. Gladstone carried away in\r\nhis memory was a sage lesson of Lyndhurst's, by which the two men of\r\ngenius at his table were in time to show themselves extremely competent\r\nto profit,--'Never defend yourself before a popular assemblage, except\r\nwith and by retorting the attack; the hearers, in the pleasure which\r\nthe assault gives them, will forget the previous charge.' As Disraeli\r\nhimself put it afterwards, _Never complain and never explain._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\n                             CHANGE OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, a few days later, while he was grappling at the treasury\r\nwith a file of papers on the mysteries of superannuation, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas again summoned by the prime minister, and again (Jan. 26) he writes\r\nto his father:--\r\n\r\n     I have had an important interview with Sir R. Peel, the result of\r\n     which is that I am to be under-secretary for the colonies. I will\r\n     give you a hurried and imperfect sketch of the conversation. He\r\n     began by saying he was about to make a great sacrifice both of his\r\n     own feelings and convenience, but that what he had to say he hoped\r\n     would be gratifying to me, as a mark of his confidence and regard.\r\n     'I am going to propose to you, Gladstone, that you should be, for\r\n     you know Wortley has lost his election, under-secretary of state\r\n     for the colonies, and I give you my word that I do not know six\r\n     offices which are at this moment of greater importance than that to\r\n     which is attached the representation of the colonial department in\r\n     the House of Commons, at a period when so many questions of\r\n     importance are in agitation.' I expressed as well as I could, and\r\n     indeed it was but ill, my unfeigned and deep sense of his kindness,\r\n     my hesitation to form any opinion of my own competency for the\r\n     office, and at the same time my general desire not to shrink from\r\n     any responsibility which he might think proper to lay upon me. He\r\n     said that was the right and manly view to take.... He adverted to\r\n     my connection with the West Indies as likely to give satisfaction\r\n     to persons dependent on those colonies, and thought that others\r\n     would not be displeased. In short, I cannot go through it all, but\r\n     I can only say that if I had always heard of him that he was the\r\n     warmest and freest person of all living in the expression of his\r\n     feelings, such description would have been fully borne out by his\r\n     demeanour to me. When I came away he took my hand and said, '_Well,\r\n     God bless you, wherever you are._'\r\n\r\nFrom Sir Robert the new under-secretary made his way, in fear and\r\ntrembling, to his new chief, Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n     Distinction of itself naturally and properly rather alarms the\r\n     young. I had heard of his high character; but I had also heard of\r\n     him as a man of cold manners, and close and even haughty reserve.\r\n     It was dark when I entered his room, so that I saw his figure\r\n     rather than his countenance. I do not recollect the matter of the\r\n     conversation, but I well remember that, before I had been three\r\n     minutes with him, all my apprehensions had melted away like snow in\r\n     the sun. I came away from that interview conscious indeed of his\r\n     dignity, but of a dignity so tempered by a peculiar purity and\r\n     gentleness, and so associated with impressions of his kindness and\r\n     even friendship, that I believe I thought more about the wonder of\r\n     his being at that time so misunderstood by the outer world, than\r\n     about the new duties and responsibilities of my office.[67]\r\n\r\nTime only deepened these impressions. It is not hard for a great party\r\nchief to win the affection and regard of his junior colleague, and where\r\ngood fortune has brought together a congenial pair, no friendship\r\noutside the home can be more valuable, more delightful, alike to veteran\r\nand to tiro. Of all the host of famous or considerable men with whom he\r\nwas to come into official and other relations, none ever, as we shall\r\nsee, held the peculiar place in Mr. Gladstone's esteem and reverence of\r\nthe two statesmen under whose auspices he now first entered the\r\nenchanted circle of public office. The promotion was a remarkable\r\nstride. He was only five-and-twenty, his parliamentary existence had\r\nbarely covered two years, and he was wholly without powerful family\r\nconnection. 'You are aware,' Peel wrote to John Gladstone, 'of the\r\nsacrifice I have made of personal feeling to public duty, in placing\r\nyour son in one of the most important offices--that of representative of\r\nthe colonial department in the House of Commons, and thus relinquishing\r\nhis valuable aid in my own immediate department. Wherever he may be\r\nplaced, he is sure to distinguish himself.'[68]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\n                           POSITION OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's first spell of office was little more than momentary.\r\nThe liberal majority, as has so often happened, was composite, but Peel\r\ncan hardly have supposed that the sections of which it was made up would\r\nfail to coalesce, and coalesce pretty soon, for the irresistible object\r\nof ejecting ministers who were liked by none of them, and through whose\r\nrepulse they could strike an avenging blow against the king. Ardent\r\nsubalterns like Mr. Gladstone took more vehement views. The majority at\r\nonce beat the government (supported by the group of Stanleyites,\r\nfifty-three strong) in the contest for the Speaker's chair. Other\r\nrepulses followed. 'The division,' writes Mr. Gladstone to his father,\r\nwith the honourable warmth of the young party man, 'I need not say was a\r\ndisappointment to me; but it must have been much more so to those who\r\nhave ever thought well of the parliament. Our party mustered splendidly.\r\nSome few, but very, very few, of the others appear to have kept away\r\nthrough a sense of decency; they had not virtue enough to vote for the\r\nman whom they knew to be incomparably the best, and against whom they\r\nhad no charge to bring. No more shameful act I think has been done by a\r\nBritish House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nNot many days after fervently deprecating a general resignation, an\r\nill-omened purpose of this very course actually flitted across the mind\r\nof the young under-secretary himself. A scheme was on the anvil for the\r\neducation of the blacks in the West Indies, and a sudden apprehension\r\nstartled Mr. Gladstone, that his chief might devote public funds to all\r\nvarieties of denominational religious teaching. Any plan of that kind\r\nwould be utterly opposed to what with him, as we shall soon discover,\r\nwas then a fundamental principle of national polity. Happily the fatal\r\nleap was not needed, but if either small men like the government whips,\r\nor great men like Peel and Aberdeen, could have known what was passing,\r\nthey would have shaken grave heads over this spirit of unseasonable\r\nscruple at the very start of the race in a brilliant man with all his\r\nlife before him.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 4 or 5._--Charles Canning told me Peel had offered him the\r\n     vacant lordship of the treasury, through his mother. They were, he\r\n     said, very much gratified with the manner in which it had been\r\n     done, though the offer was declined, upon the ground stated in the\r\n     reply, that though he did not anticipate any discrepancy in\r\n     political sentiments to separate him from the present government,\r\n     yet he should prefer in some sense deserving an official station by\r\n     parliamentary conduct.... Peel's letter was written at some length,\r\n     very friendly, without any statesmanlike reserve or sensitive\r\n     attention to nicety of style. In the last paragraph it spoke with\r\n     amiable embarrassment of Mr. Canning; stating that his 'respect,\r\n     regard, and admiration' (I think even), apparently interrupted by\r\n     circumstances, continued fresh and vivid, and that those very\r\n     circumstances made him more desirous of thus publicly testifying\r\n     his real sentiments.\r\n\r\n     _March 30._--Wished to speak on Irish church. No opportunity. Wrote\r\n     on it. A noble-minded speech from Sir J. Graham. _March 31._--Spoke\r\n     on the Irish church--under forty minutes. I cannot help here\r\n     recording that this matter of speaking is really my strongest\r\n     religious exercise. On all occasions, and to-day especially, was\r\n     forced upon me the humiliating sense of my inability to exercise my\r\n     reason in the face of the H. of C., and of the necessity of my\r\n     utterly failing, unless God gave me the strength and language. It\r\n     was after all a poor performance, but would have been poorer had He\r\n     never been in my thoughts as a present and powerful aid. But this\r\n     is what I am as yet totally incompetent to effect--to realise, in\r\n     speaking, anything, however small, which at all satisfies my mind.\r\n     Debating seems to me less difficult, though unattained. But to hold\r\n     in serene contemplative action the mental faculties in the turbid\r\n     excitement of debate, so as to see truth clearly and set it forth\r\n     such as it is, this I cannot attain to.\r\n\r\n     As regards my speech in the Irish church debate, he tells his\r\n     father (April 2), it was received by the House, and has been\r\n     estimated, in a manner extremely gratifying to me. As regards\r\n     satisfaction to myself in the manner of its execution, I cannot say\r\n     so much. Backed by a numerous and warm-hearted party, and strong in\r\n     the consciousness of a good cause, I did not find it difficult to\r\n     grapple with the more popular parts of the question; but I fell\r\n     miserably short of my desires in touching upon the principles which\r\n     the discussion involved, and I am sure that it must be long before\r\n     I am enabled in any reasonable sense to be a speaker according even\r\n     to the conception which I have formed in my own mind.\r\n\r\nA few days later, he received the congratulations of a royal\r\npersonage:--\r\n\r\n     In the evening, dining at Lord Salisbury's, I was introduced to the\r\n     Duke of Cumberland, who was pleased to express himself favourably\r\n     of my speech. He is fond of conversation, and the common reputation\r\n     which he bears of including in his conversation many oaths, appears\r\n     to be but too true. Yet he said he had made a point of sending his\r\n     son to George the Fourth's funeral, thinking it an excellent\r\n     advantage for a boy to receive the impression which such a scene\r\n     was calculated to convey. The duke made many acute remarks, and\r\n     was, I should say, most remarkably unaffected and kind. These are\r\n     fine social qualities for a prince, though, of course, not the most\r\n     important--'My dear Sir,' and thumps on the shoulder after a ten\r\n     minutes' acquaintance. He spoke broadly and freely--much on the\r\n     disappearance of the bishops' wigs, which he said had done more\r\n     harm to the church than anything else!\r\n\r\n                           MINISTERS DEFEATED\r\n\r\nOn the same night the catastrophe happened. After a protracted and\r\ncomplex struggle Lord John Russell's proposal for the appropriation of\r\nthe surplus revenues of the Irish church was carried against ministers.\r\nThe following day Peel announced his resignation.\r\n\r\nThough his official work had been unimportant, Mr. Gladstone had left an\r\nexcellent impression behind him among the permanent men. When he first\r\nappeared in the office, Henry Taylor said, 'I rather like Gladstone, but\r\nhe is said to have more of the devil in him than appears.' A few weeks\r\nwere enough to show him that 'Gladstone was far the most considerable of\r\nthe rising generation, having besides his abilities an excellent\r\ndisposition and great strength of character.' James Stephen thought well\r\nof him, but doubted if he had pugnacity enough for public life.\r\n\r\nA few days later Mr. Gladstone dined with an official party at the\r\nfallen minister's:--\r\n\r\n     Sir R. Peel made a very nice speech on Lincoln's proposing and our\r\n     drinking his health. The following is a slight and bad sketch:--'I\r\n     really can hardly call you gentlemen alone. I would rather address\r\n     you as my warm and attached friends in whom I have the fullest\r\n     confidence, and with whom it has afforded me the greatest\r\n     satisfaction to be associated during the struggle which has just\r\n     been brought to a close. In undertaking the government, from the\r\n     first I have never expected to succeed; still it was my conviction\r\n     that good might be done, and I trust that good has been effected. I\r\n     believe we have shown that even if a conservative government be not\r\n     strong enough to carry on the public affairs of this country, at\r\n     least we are so strong that we ought to be able to prevent any\r\n     other government from doing any serious mischief to its\r\n     institutions. We meet now as we met at the beginning of the\r\n     session, then perhaps in somewhat finer dresses, but not, I am\r\n     sure, with kindlier feelings towards each other.'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the session Mr. Gladstone passed in his usual pursuits,\r\nreading all sorts of books, from the correspondence of Leibnitz with\r\nBossuet, and Alexander Knox's _Remains_, down to Rousseau's\r\n_Confessions_. As to the last of these he scarcely knew whether to read\r\non or to throw it aside, and, in fact, he seems only to have persevered\r\nwith that strange romance of a wandering soul for a day or two. Besides\r\npromiscuous reading, he performed some scribbling, including a sonnet,\r\nrecorded in his diary with notes of wondering exclamation. His family\r\nwere in London for most of May, his mother in bad health; no other\r\nengagement ever interrupted his sedulous attendance on her every day,\r\nreading the Bible to her, and telling the news about levees and\r\ndrawing-rooms, a great dinner at Sir Robert Peel's, and all the rest of\r\nhis business and recreations. In the House he did little between the\r\nfall of the ministry and the close of the session. He once wished to\r\nspeak, but was shut out by the length of other speeches. 'So,' he\r\nmoralises, 'I had two useful lessons instead of one. For the sense of\r\nhelplessness which always possesses me in prospect of a speech is one\r\nvery useful lesson; and being disappointed after having attained some\r\ndue state of excitement and anticipation is another.'\r\n\r\n                        SPEECH AT NEWARK\r\n\r\nIn June at a feast at Newark, which, terrible to relate, lasted from\r\nfour o'clock to eleven, Mr. Gladstone gave them nearly an hour, not to\r\nmention divers minor speeches. His father 'expressed himself with\r\nbeautiful and affectionate truth of feeling, and the party sympathised.'\r\nHis own speech deserves to be noted as indicating the political\r\ngeography for three or four years to come. The standing dish of the tory\r\nopposition of the period was highly-spiced reproach of the ministers for\r\nliving on the support of O'Connell, and Newark was regaled with an ample\r\nmeal. Mr. Gladstone would not enter into a detail of the exploits,\r\ncharacter, political opinions of that Irish gentleman; he would rather\r\nsay what he thought of him in his presence than in his absence, because\r\nhe could unfortunately say nothing of him but what was bad. 'This is not\r\nthe first period in English history,' Mr. Gladstone noted down at that\r\ntime, 'in which a government has leaned on the Roman catholic interest\r\nin Ireland for support. Under the administration of Strafford and at the\r\ntime of the Scotch revolt, Charles I. was enthusiastically supported by\r\nthe recusants of the sister isle, and what was the effect? The religious\r\nsympathies of the people were touched then and they were so now with the\r\nsame consequence, in the gradual decline of the party to whom the\r\nsuspicion attaches in popular fervour and estimation.' Half a century\r\nlater he may have recalled this early fruit of historic observation.\r\nMeanwhile, in his Newark speech, he denounced the government for seeking\r\nto undo the mischief of the Irish alliance by systematic agitation. But\r\nit was upon the church question, far deeper and more vital than\r\nmunicipal corporations, that the fate of the government should be\r\ndecided. Then followed a vindication of the church in Ireland. 'The\r\nprotestant faith is held good for us, and _what is good for us is also\r\ngood for the population of Ireland_.' That most disastrous of all our\r\nfalse commonplaces was received at Newark, as it has been received so\r\nmany hundreds of times ever since all over England, with loud and\r\nlong-continued cheering, to be invariably followed in after act and\r\nevent with loud and long-continued groaning.[69] Four years later Mr.\r\nGladstone heard words from Lord John Russell on this point, that began\r\nto change his mind. 'Often do I think,' he wrote to Lord Russell in\r\n1870, 'of a saying of yours more than thirty years back which struck me\r\nineffaceably at the time. You said: \"The true key to our Irish debates\r\nwas this: that it was not properly borne in mind that as England is\r\ninhabited by Englishmen, and Scotland by Scotchmen, so Ireland is\r\ninhabited by Irishmen.\"'[70]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] _Gleanings_, i. p. 38.\r\n\r\n[64] In another place he describes it as an action done 'with no sort of\r\nreason' (_Ib._ p. 78). But the Melbourne papers, published in 1890, pp.\r\n219-221 and 225, indicate that Melbourne had spontaneously given the\r\nking good reasons for cashiering him and his colleagues.\r\n\r\n[65] Lord Palmerston doubted (Nov. 25, 1834) whether Peel would\r\ndissolve. 'I think his own bias will rather be to abide by the decision\r\nof this House of Commons, and try to propitiate it by great professions\r\nof reform. The effect of a dissolution must be injurious to the\r\nprinciples that he professes.... But he may be overborne by the violent\r\npeople of his own party whom he will not be able to control.' Ashley's\r\n_Life of Palmerston_ (1879), i. p. 313.\r\n\r\n[66] Greville, on the other hand, grumbled at Peel, for taking high\r\nbirth and connections as substitutes for other qualities, because he\r\nmade Sidney Herbert secretary at the board of control, instead of making\r\nhim a lord of the treasury, and sending 'Gladstone, who is a very clever\r\nman,' to the other and more responsible post.\r\n\r\n[67] Lord Stanmore's _Earl of Aberdeen_ (1893), p. iii.\r\n\r\n[68] Parker's _Peel_, ii. p. 267.\r\n\r\n[69] O'Connell paid Newark a short visit in 1836--spoke against Mr.\r\nGladstone for an hour in the open air, and then left the town, both he\r\nand it much as they had been before his arrival.\r\n\r\n[70] Walpole, _Life of Lord John Russell_, ii. p. 455.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       PROGRESS IN PUBLIC LIFE\r\n\r\n                            (_1835-1838_)\r\n\r\n     Les hommes en tout ne s'eclairent que par le tatonnement de\r\n     l'experience. Les plus grands genies sont eux-memes entraines par\r\n     leur siecle.--TURGOT.\r\n\r\n     Men are only enlightened by feeling their way through experience.\r\n     The greatest geniuses are themselves drawn along by their age.\r\n\r\nIn September (1835), after long suffering, his mother died amid tender\r\ncare and mournful regrets. Her youngest son was a devoted nurse; her\r\nloss struck him keenly, but with a sense full of the consolations of his\r\nfaith. To Gaskell he writes: 'How deeply and thoroughly her character\r\nwas imbued with love; with what strong and searching processes of bodily\r\naffliction she was assimilated in mind and heart to her Redeemer; how\r\nabove all other things she sighed for the advancement of His kingdom on\r\nearth; how few mortals suffered more pain, or more faithfully recognised\r\nit as one of the instruments by which God is pleased to forward that\r\nrestoring process for which we are placed on earth.'\r\n\r\nThen the world resumed its course for him, and things fell into their\r\nwonted ways of indefatigable study. His scheme for week-days included\r\nBlackstone, Mackintosh, Aristotle's _Politics_--'a book of immense value\r\nfor all governors and public men'--Dante's _Purgatorio_, Spanish\r\ngrammar, Tocqueville, Fox's _James II._, by which he was disappointed,\r\nnot seeing such an acuteness in extracting and exhibiting the principles\r\nthat govern from beneath the actions of men and parties, nor such a\r\ngrasp of generalisation, nor such a faculty of separating minute from\r\nmaterial particulars, nor such an abstraction from a debater's modes of\r\nthought and forms of expression, as he should have hoped. To these he\r\nadded as he went along the _Genie du Christianisme_, Bolingbroke,\r\nBacon's _Essays_, _Don Quixote_, the _Annals_ of Tacitus, Le Bas' _Life\r\nof Laud_ ('somewhat too Laudish, though right _au fond_'; unlike\r\nLawson's _Laud_, 'a most intemperate book, the foam swallows up all the\r\nfacts'), _Childe Harold_, _Jerusalem Delivered_ ('beautiful in its kind,\r\nbut how can its author be placed in the same category of genius as\r\nDante?'), Pollok's _Course of Time_ ('much talent, little culture,\r\ninsufficient power to digest and construct his subject or his\r\nversification; his politics radical, his religious sentiments generally\r\nsound, though perhaps hard').\r\n\r\nIn the evenings he read aloud to his father the _Faery Queen_ and\r\nShakespeare. On Sundays he read Chillingworth and Jewel, and, above all,\r\nhe dug and delved in St. Augustine. He drew a sketch of a project\r\ntouching Peculiarities in Religion. For several days he was writing\r\nsomething on politics. Then an outline or an essay on our colonial\r\nsystem. For he was no reader of the lounging, sauntering, passively\r\nreceptive species; he went forward in a sedulous process of import and\r\nexport, a mind actively at work on all the topics that passed before it.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1836 he was invited to pay a visit to\r\nDrayton, where he found only Lord Harrowby--a link with the great men of\r\nan earlier generation, for he had acted as Pitt's second in the duel\r\nwith Tierney, and had been foreign secretary in Pitt's administration of\r\n1804; might have been prime minister in 1827 if he had liked; and he\r\nheaded the Waverers who secured the passing of the Reform bill by the\r\nLords. Other guests followed, the host rather contracting in freedom of\r\nconversation as the party expanded.[71]\r\n\r\n                            VISIT TO DRAYTON\r\n\r\n     I cannot record anything continuous, Mr. Gladstone writes in his\r\n     memorandum of the visit, but commit to paper several opinions and\r\n     expressions of Sir R. Peel, which bore upon interesting and\r\n     practical questions. That Fox was not a man of settled, reasoned,\r\n     political principle. Lord Harrowby added that he was thrown into\r\n     opposition and whiggism by the insult of Lord North. That his own\r\n     doctrines, both as originally declared, and as resumed when finally\r\n     in office, were of a highly toned spirit of government. That\r\n     Brougham was the most _powerful_ man he had ever known in the H. of\r\n     C.; that no one had ever fallen so fast and so far. That the\r\n     political difficulties of England might be susceptible of cure, and\r\n     were not appalling; but that the state of Ireland was to all\r\n     appearance hopeless. That there the great difficulty lay in\r\n     procuring the ordinary administration of justice; that the very\r\n     institution of juries supposed a common interest of the juror and\r\n     the state, a condition not fulfilled in the present instance; that\r\n     it was quite unfit for the present state of society in Ireland.\r\n     Lord Harrowby thought that a strong conservative government might\r\n     still quell agitation. And Sir B. Peel said Stanley had told him\r\n     that the whig government were on the point of succeeding in putting\r\n     a stop to the resistance to payment of tithe, when Lord Althorp,\r\n     alarmed at the expense already incurred, wrote to stop its\r\n     collection by the military. We should probably live to see the\r\n     independence of Poland established.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of Wellington and others arrived later in the day. It was\r\n     pleasing to see the deference with which he was received as he\r\n     entered the library; at the sound of his name everybody rose; he is\r\n     addressed by all with a respectful manner. He met Peel most\r\n     cordially, and seized both Lady Peel's hands. I now recollect that\r\n     it was with _glee_ Sir R. Peel said to me on Monday, 'I am glad to\r\n     say you will meet the duke here,' which had reference, I doubt not,\r\n     partly to the anticipated pleasure of seeing him, partly to the\r\n     dissipation of unworthy suspicions. He reported that government are\r\n     still labouring at a church measure without appropriation. _Jan.\r\n     20._--The Duke of Wellington appears to speak little; and never for\r\n     speaking's sake, but only to convey an idea, commonly worth\r\n     conveying. He receives remarks made to him very frequently with no\r\n     more than 'Ha,' a convenient, suspensive expression, which\r\n     acknowledges the arrival of the observation and no more. Of the two\r\n     days which he spent here he hunted on Thursday, shot on Friday, and\r\n     to-day travelled to Strathfieldsay, more, I believe, than 100\r\n     miles, to entertain a party of friends to dinner. With this bodily\r\n     exertion he mixes at 66 or 67 a constant attention to business. Sir\r\n     R. Peel mentioned to me to-night a very remarkable example of his\r\n     [the duke's] perhaps excessive precision. Whenever he signs a draft\r\n     on Coutts's, he addresses to them at the same time a note apprising\r\n     them that he has done so. This perfect facility of transition from\r\n     one class of occupation to their opposites, and their habitual\r\n     intermixture without any apparent encroachments on either side, is,\r\n     I think, a very remarkable evidence of self-command, and a mental\r\n     power of singular utility. Sir Robert is also, I conceive, a\r\n     thrifty dealer with his time, but in a man of his age [Peel now 48]\r\n     this is less beyond expectation.\r\n\r\nHe said good-bye on the last night with regret. In the midst of the\r\ngreat company he found time to read Bossuet on Variations, remarking\r\nrather oddly, 'some of Bossuet's theology seems to me very good.'\r\n\r\n                            MIXED AVOCATIONS\r\n\r\n     On Jan. 30th is the entry of his journey from Liverpool, '1 to 4 to\r\n     Hawarden Castle.' [I suppose his first visit to his future home.]\r\n     Got to Chester (Feb. 1) five minutes after the mail had started.\r\n     Got on by Albion. Outside all night; frost; rain; arrived at Albany\r\n     113/4. _Feb. 4th._--Session opens. Voted in 243-284. A good\r\n     opportunity for speaking, but in my weakness did not use it. _Feb.\r\n     8th._--Stanley made a noble speech. Voted in 243 to 307 for\r\n     abolition of Irish corporations. Pendulums and Nothingarians all\r\n     against us. _Sunday._--Wrote on Hypocrisy. On Worship. Attempted to\r\n     explain this to the servants at night. Newman's Sermons and J.\r\n     Taylor. Trench's Poems. _March 2nd._--Read to my deep sorrow of\r\n     Anstice's death on Monday. His friends, his young widow, the world\r\n     can spare him ill; so says at least the flesh. Stapleton.\r\n     _Paradiso_, VII. VIII. Calls. Rode. Wrote. Dined at Lord\r\n     Ashbuxton's. House. Statistical Society's _Proceedings._ Verses on\r\n     Anstice's death. _March 22nd._--House 51/4-93/4. Spoke 50 minutes [on\r\n     negro apprenticeship; see p. 145]; kindly heard, and I should thank\r\n     God for being made able to speak even thus indifferently.[72]\r\n     _March 23rd_.... Late, having been awake last night till between 4\r\n     and 5, as usual after speaking. How useful to make us feel the\r\n     habitual unremembered blessing of sound sleep.... _April\r\n     7th._--_Gerus. Lib._ c. xi.... Dr. Pusey here from 12 to 3 about\r\n     church building. Rode. At night 11 to 2 perusing Henry Taylor's\r\n     proofs of _The Statesman_, and writing notes on it, presumptuous\r\n     enough.... _Gerus._ xii. Re-perused Taylor's sheets. A batch of\r\n     calls. Wrote letters. Bossuet. Dined at Henry Taylor's, a keen\r\n     intellectual exercise, and thus a place of danger, especially as it\r\n     is exercise seen.... _9th._--Spedding at breakfast. _Gerus._ xiii.\r\n     Finished Locke on Understanding. It appears to me on the whole a\r\n     much overrated, though, in some respects, a very useful book....\r\n     _May 16th._--Mr. Wordsworth, H. Taylor, and Doyle to breakfast. Sat\r\n     till 123/4. Conversation on Shelley, Trench, Tennyson; travelling,\r\n     copyright, etc. _30th._--Milnes, Blakesley, Taylor, Cole, to\r\n     breakfast. Church meeting at Archbishop of Armagh's. Ancient music\r\n     rehearsal. House 6-81/4 and 91/4-12. _June 1st._--Read Wordsworth....\r\n     House 5-12. Spoke about 45 minutes [on Tithes and Church (Ireland)\r\n     bill]. I had this pleasure in my speech, that I never rose more\r\n     intent upon telling what I believe to be royal truth; though I did\r\n     it very ill, and further than ever below the idea which I would\r\n     nevertheless hold before my mind. _3rd._--West Indies Committee\r\n     1-4. Finished writing out my speech and sent it. Read\r\n     Wordsworth.... Saw Sir R. Peel. Dined at Sergeant Talfourd's to\r\n     meet Wordsworth.... _5th._--St. James's, Communion. Dined at\r\n     Lincoln's Inn. St. Sepulchre's. Wrote. Jer. Taylor, Newman. Began\r\n     Nicole's _Prejuges_. Arnold aloud. _8th._--Wordsworth, since he has\r\n     been in town, has breakfasted twice and dined once with me.\r\n     Intercourse with him is, upon the whole, extremely pleasing. I was\r\n     sorry to hear Sydney Smith say that he did not see very much in\r\n     him, nor greatly admire his poems. He even adverted to the London\r\n     Sonnet as ridiculous. Sheil thought this of the line:\r\n\r\n       'Dear God! the very houses seem asleep.'\r\n\r\n     I ventured to call his attention to that which followed as carrying\r\n     out the idea:\r\n\r\n       'And all that mighty heart is lying still.'\r\n\r\n     Of which I may say _omne tulit punctum_.\r\n\r\n     Wordsworth came in to breakfast the other day before his time. I\r\n     asked him to excuse me while I had my servant to prayers; but he\r\n     expressed a _hearty_ wish to be present, which was delightful. He\r\n     has laboured long; if for himself, yet more for men, and over all I\r\n     trust for God. Will he ever be the bearer of evil thoughts to any\r\n     mind? Glory is gathering round his later years on earth, and his\r\n     later works especially indicate the spiritual ripening of his noble\r\n     soul. I heard but few of his opinions; but these are some He was\r\n     charmed with Trench's poems; liked Alford; thought Shelley had the\r\n     greatest native powers in poetry of all the men of this age. In\r\n     reading _Die Braut von Korinth_ translated, was more horrified than\r\n     enchained, or rather altogether the first. Wondered how any one\r\n     could translate it or the Faust, but spoke as knowing the original.\r\n     Thought little of Murillo as to the mind of painting; said he could\r\n     not have painted Paul Veronese's 'Marriage of Cana.' Considered\r\n     that old age in great measure disqualified him by its rigid fixity\r\n     of habits from judging of the works of young poets--I must say that\r\n     he was here even over liberal in self-depreciation. He defended the\r\n     make of the steamboat as more poetical than otherwise to the eye\r\n     (see Sonnets).[73] Thought Coleridge admired Ossian only in youth,\r\n     and himself admired the spirit which Macpherson _professes_ to\r\n     embody.\r\n\r\n     Sergeant Talfourd dined here to meet Wordsworth yesterday.\r\n     Wordsworth is vehement against Byron. Saw in Shelley the lowest\r\n     form of irreligion, but a later progress towards better things.\r\n     Named the discrepancy between his creed and his imagination as the\r\n     marring idea of his works, in which description I could not concur.\r\n     Spoke of the _entire_ revolution in his own poetical taste. We were\r\n     agreed that a man's personal character ought to be the basis of his\r\n     politics. He quoted his sonnet on the contested election [what\r\n     sonnet is this?], from which I ventured to differ as regards its\r\n     assuming nutriment for the heart to be inherent in politics. He\r\n     described to me his views; that the Reform Act had, as it were,\r\n     brought out too prominently a particular muscle of the national\r\n     frame: the strength of the towns; that the cure was to be found in\r\n     a large further enfranchisement, I fancy, of the country chiefly;\r\n     that you would thus extend the base of your pyramid and so give it\r\n     strength. He wished the old institutions of the country preserved,\r\n     and thought this the way to preserve them. He thought the political\r\n     franchise upon the whole a good to the mass--regard being had to\r\n     the state of human nature; against me. _11th._--Read Browning's\r\n     _Paracelsus_. Went to Richmond to dine with the Gaskells. A two\r\n     hours' walk home at night. _16th._--Wrote two sonnets. Finished and\r\n     wrote out _Brant von Korinth_. Shall I ever dare to make out a\r\n     counterpart? _21st._--Breakfast at Mr. Hallam's to meet Mr.\r\n     Wordsworth and Mr. Rogers. Wordsworth spoke much and justly about\r\n     copyright. Conversation with Talfourd in the evening, partly about\r\n     that subject. Began something on egotism. _24th._--Breakfast with\r\n     Mr. Rogers, Mr. Wordsworth only there. Very agreeable. Rogers\r\n     produced an American poem, the death of Bozzaris, which Wordsworth\r\n     proposed that I should read to them: of course I declined, so even\r\n     did Rogers. But Wordsworth read it through in good taste, and doing\r\n     it justice.\r\n\r\n     _Fasque_ in time for Aug. 12; out on the hill, but unlucky with a\r\n     sprained ankle, and obliged to give up early. _Aug. 15th._--Wrote\r\n     (long) to Dr. Chalmers. Orator. _Sept. 20th._--Milner, finished\r\n     Vol. ii. Cic. _Acad._ Wraxall. Began Goethe's _Iphigenie_. Wrote.\r\n     _Oct. 7th._--Milner. Wraxall. A dinner-party. Wrote out a sketch\r\n     for an essay on Justification. Singing, whist, shooting. Copied a\r\n     paper for my father. _12th._--A day on the hill for roe. 14 guns.\r\n     [To Liverpool for public dinner at the Amphitheatre.] _18th._--Most\r\n     kindly heard. Canning's debut everything that could be desired. I\r\n     thought I spoke 35 minutes, but afterwards found it was 55. Read\r\n     _Marco Visconti_. _21st._--Operative dinner at Amphitheatre. Spoke\r\n     perhaps 16 or 18 minutes. _28th._--_Haddo_ [Lord Aberdeen's].\r\n     Finished _Marco Visconti_, a long bout, but I could not let it go.\r\n     Buckland's opening chapters. _On the whole_ satisfactory.\r\n     _30th._--Lord Aberdeen read prayers in the evening with simple and\r\n     earnest pathos. _Nov. 10th._--_Wilhehm Meister_, Book i., and there\r\n     I mean to leave it, unless I hear a better report of the succeeding\r\n     one than I could make of the first. Next day, recommenced with\r\n     great anticipations of delight the _Divina Commedia_.\r\n     _13th._--Finished Nicole _De l'Unite_. August. _De Civ._ [Every day\r\n     at this time.] _19th._--Began Cicero's _Tusculan Questions_....\r\n     _25th._--Aug. _Civ. Dei._ I am now in Book xiv. Cic. _Tusc._\r\n     finished. Book ii. _Purgatorio_, iii.-v. A dose of whist. Still\r\n     snow and rain. _26th._--Aug. Cicero. Billiards. _Purgatorio_,\r\n     vi.-viii. Began Dryden's _Fables._ My eyes are not in their best\r\n     plight, and I am obliged to consider type a little. _Jan. 3rd_,\r\n     1837.--Breakfasted with Dr. Chalmers. How kind my father is in\r\n     small matters as well as great--thoughtfully sending carriage.\r\n     _13th, Glasgow._--The pavilion astonishing, and the whole effect\r\n     very grand. Near 3500. Sir E. Peel spoke 1 h. 55 m. Explicit and\r\n     bold; it was a very great effort. I kept within 15 min.--quite long\r\n     enough. _14th._--71/2-51/2 mail to Carlisle. On all night, _15th._\r\n     Wetherby at 71/2. Leeds 101/2. Church there. Walked over to Wakefield.\r\n     Church there. Evening at Thornes. [Milnes Gaskell's.] _17th._--To\r\n     Newark. Very good meeting. Spoke 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\nIn this speech, after the regulation denunciation of the reckless\r\nwickedness of O'Connell, he set about demonstrating the change that had\r\ntaken place in the character of public feeling during the last few\r\nyears. He pointed out that at the dissolution of 1831 the conservative\r\nmembers of the House of Commons amounted perhaps to 50. In 1835 they saw\r\nthis small dispirited band grow into a resolute and formidable phalanx\r\nof 300. The cry was: 'Resolute attachment to the institutions of the\r\ncountry.' One passage in the speech is of interest in the history of his\r\nattitude on toleration. Sir William Moles worth had been invited to come\r\nforward as candidate for the representation of Leeds. A report spread\r\nthat Sir William was not a believer in the Christian articles of faith.\r\nSomebody wrote to Molesworth, to know if this was true. He answered,\r\nthat the question whether he was a believer in the Christian religion\r\nwas one that no man of liberal principles ought to propose to another,\r\nor could propose without being guilty of a dereliction of duty. On this\r\nincident, Mr. Gladstone said that he would ask, 'Is it not a time for\r\nserious reflection among moderate and candid men of all parties, when\r\nsuch a question was actually thought impertinent interference? Surely\r\nthey would say with him, that men who have no belief in the divine\r\nrevelation are not the men to govern this nation, be they whigs or\r\nradicals.' Long, extraordinary, and not inglorious, was the ascent from\r\nsuch a position as this, to the principles so nobly vindicated in the\r\nspeech on the Affirmation bill in 1883.\r\n\r\n                            PARTY COUNCILS\r\n\r\nAt the end of January he is back in London, arranging books and papers\r\nand making a little daylight in his chaos. 'What useful advice might a\r\nman who has been _buon pezzo_ in parliament give to one going into it,\r\non this mechanical portion of his business.' The entries for 1837 are\r\nnone of them especially interesting. Every day in the midst of full\r\nparliamentary work, social engagements, and public duties outside of the\r\nHouse of Commons, he was elaborating the treatise on the relations of\r\nchurch and state, of which we shall see more in our following chapter.\r\nAt the beginning of the session he went to a dinner at Peel's, at which\r\nLord Stanley and some of his friends were present--a circumstance noted\r\nas a sign of the impending fusion between the whig seceders of 1834 and\r\nthe conservative party. Sir Robert seems to have gone on extending his\r\nconfidence in him.\r\n\r\n     I visited Sir Robert Peel (March 4th) about the Canada question,\r\n     and again by appointment on the 6th, with Lord Aberdeen. On the\r\n     former day he said, 'Is there anyone else to invite?' I suggested\r\n     Lord Stanley. He said, perhaps he might be inclined to take a\r\n     separate view. But in the interval he had apparently thought\r\n     otherwise. For on Monday he read to Lord Aberdeen and myself a\r\n     letter from Stanley written with the utmost frankness and in a tone\r\n     of political intimacy, saying that an engagement as chairman of a\r\n     committee at the House would prevent his meeting us. The business\r\n     of the day was discussed in conversation, and it was agreed to be\r\n     quite impossible to support the resolution on the legislative\r\n     council in its existing terms, without at least a protest. Peel\r\n     made the following remark: 'You have got another Ireland growing up\r\n     in every colony you possess.'\r\n\r\nA week later he was shocked by the death of Lady Canning. 'Breakfast\r\nwith Gaskell' (March 23rd), 'and thence to Lady Canning's funeral in\r\nWestminster Abbey. We were but eleven in attendance. Her coffin was\r\nlaid on that of her illustrious husband. Canning showed a deep but manly\r\nsorrow. May we live as by the side of a grave and looking in.'\r\n\r\nIn the same month he spoke on Canada (March 8th) 'with insufficient\r\npossession of the subject,' and a week later on church rates, for an\r\nhour or more, 'with more success than the matter or manner deserved.' He\r\nfinished his translation of the _Bride of Corinth_, and the episode of\r\nUgolino from Dante, and read Eckermann's _Conversations with Goethe_, to\r\nwhich he gives the too commonplace praise of being very interesting. He\r\nlearned Manzoni's noble ode on the death of Napoleon, of which he\r\nby-and-by made a noble translation; this by way of sparing his eyes, and\r\nItalian poetry not taking him nearly half the time of any other to\r\ncommit to memory. He found a 'beautiful and powerful production' in\r\nChanning's letter to Clay, and he made the acquaintance of Southey, 'in\r\nappearance benignant, melancholy, and intellectual.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                      THE GENERAL ELECTION OF 1837\r\n\r\nIn June King William IV. died, 'leaving a perilous legacy to his\r\nsuccessor.' A month later (July 14) Mr. Gladstone went up with the\r\nOxford address, and this was, I suppose, the first occasion on which he\r\nwas called to present himself before the Queen, with whose long reign\r\nhis own future career and fame were destined to be so closely and so\r\nconspicuously associated. According to the old law prescribing a\r\ndissolution of parliament within six months of the demise of the crown,\r\nMr. Gladstone was soon in the thick of a general election. By July 17th\r\nhe was at Newark, canvassing, speaking, hand-shaking, and in lucid\r\nintervals reading Filicaja. He found a very strong, angry, and general\r\nsentiment, not against the principle of the poor law as regards the\r\nable-bodied, but against the regulations for separating man and wife,\r\nand sending the old compulsorily to the workhouse, with others of a like\r\nnature. With the disapprobation on these heads he in great part\r\nconcurred. There was to be no contest, but arrangements of this kind\r\nstill leave room for some anxiety, and in Mr. Gladstone's case a\r\nsingular thing happened. Two days after his arrival at Newark he was\r\nfollowed by a body of gentlemen from Manchester, with an earnest\r\ninvitation that he would be a candidate for that great town. He declined\r\nthe invitation, absolutely as he supposed, but the Manchester tories\r\nnominated him notwithstanding. They assured the electors that he was the\r\nmost promising young statesman of the day. The whigs on the other hand\r\nvowed that he was an insulter of dissent, a bigot of such dark hue as to\r\nwish to subject even the poor negroes of his father's estates to the\r\nslavery of a dominant church, a man who owed whatever wealth and\r\nconsequence his family possessed to the crime of holding his\r\nfellow-creatures in bondage, a man who, though honest and consistent,\r\nwas a member of that small ultra-tory minority which followed the Duke\r\nof Cumberland. When the votes were counted, Mr. Gladstone was at the\r\nbottom of the poll, with a majority of many hundreds against him.[74]\r\n\r\nMeantime he was already member for Newark. His own election was no\r\nsooner over than he caught the last vacant place on the mail to\r\nCarlisle, whence he hastened to the aid of his father's patriotic\r\nlabours as candidate for Dundee. Here he worked hard at canvassing and\r\nmeetings, often pelted with mud and stones, but encouraged by friends\r\nmore buoyant than the event justified.\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 1st._--My father beaten after all, our promised votes in many\r\n     cases going back or going against us.... Two hundred promises\r\n     broken. Poll closed at Parnell, 666; Gladstone, 381. It is not in\r\n     human approbation that the reward of right action is to be sought.\r\n     Left at 41/2 amid the hisses of the crowd. Perth at 71/4. Left at one\r\n     in the morning for Glasgow. _2nd._--Glasgow 81/2. Steamer at 11.\r\n     Breeze; miserably sick; deck all night. _3rd._--Arrived at 111/2;\r\n     (Liverpool), very sore. _4th._--Out at 81/2 to vote for S.\r\n     Lancashire. Acted as representative in the booth half the day.\r\n     Results of election excellent. _5th._--Again at the booths. A great\r\n     victory here. _6th._--Wrote to Manning on the death of his wife.\r\n     _9th._--_Manchester._ Public dinner at 6; lasted till near 12.\r\n     Music excellent. Spoke 11/2 hours, I am told, _proh pudor!_[75]\r\n\r\nBack at Fasque, only a day too late for the Twelfth, he found the sport\r\nbad and he shot badly, but he enjoyed the healthful walks on the hill.\r\nHis employments were curiously mixed. '_Sept. 8th._--In the bog for\r\nsnipe with Sir J. Mackenzie. Read _Timaeus_. Began Byron's Life. My eyes\r\nrefused progress. Verses. _15th._--Snipe-shooting with F. in the bog.\r\nBegan _Critias_. _22nd._--_Haddo._ Otter-hunting, _senz esito_. Finished\r\nPlato's _Laws_. Hunting too in the library.' The mental dispersion of\r\ncountry-house visiting never affects either multifarious reading or\r\nmultifarious writing. Spanish grammar, _Don Quixote_ in the original,\r\nCrabbe, _Don Juan_, alternate with Augustine _de peccatorum remissione_\r\nor _de utilitate Credendi_ ('beautiful and useful'). He works at an\r\nessay of his own upon Justification, at adversaria on Aristotle's\r\n_Ethics_, at another essay upon Rationalism, and to save his eyes,\r\nspins verse enough to fill a decent volume of a hundred and fifty pages.\r\nHe makes a circuit of calls upon the tenants, taking a farming lecture\r\nfrom one, praying by the sick-bed of another.\r\n\r\n                        BUSINESS WITH WELLINGTON\r\n\r\nIn November he was again in London to be sworn of the new parliament,\r\nand at the end of the month he had for the first time an interview on\r\nbusiness with the Duke of Wellington--of interest as the collocation of\r\ntwo famous names. 'The immediate subject was the Cape of Good Hope. His\r\nreception of me was plain but kind. He came to the door of his room.\r\n\"Will you come in? How do you do? I am glad to see you.\" We spoke a\r\nlittle of the Cape. He said with regard to the war--and with sufficient\r\nmodesty--that he was pretty well aware of the operations that had taken\r\nplace in it, having been at the Cape, and being in some degree able to\r\njudge of those matters. He said, \"I suppose it is there as everywhere\r\nelse, as we had it last night about Ireland and the House of Lords. They\r\nwon't use the law, as it is in Canada, as it is in the West Indies. They\r\nexcite insurrection everywhere (I, however, put in an apology for them\r\nin the West Indies), they _want to play the part of opposition_; they\r\nare not a government, for they don't maintain the law.\" He appointed me\r\nto return to him to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nThe result of the general election was a slight improvement in the\r\nposition of the conservatives, but they still mustered no more than 315\r\nagainst 342 supporters of the ministry, including the radical and Irish\r\ngroups. If Melbourne and Russell found their team delicate to drive,\r\nPeel's difficulties were hardly less. Few people, he wrote at this\r\nmoment, can judge of the difficulty there has frequently been in\r\nmaintaining harmony between the various branches of the conservative\r\nparty. The great majority in the Lords and the minority in the Commons\r\nconsisted of very different elements; they included men like Stanley and\r\nGraham, who had been authors and advocates of parliamentary reform, and\r\nmen who had denounced reform as treason to the constitution and ruin to\r\nthe country. Even the animosities of 1829 and catholic emancipation were\r\nonly half quenched within the tory ranks.[76] It was at a meeting held\r\nat Peel's on December 6, 1837, that Lord Stanley for the first time\r\nappeared among the conservative members.\r\n\r\nThe distractions produced in Canada by mismanagement and misapprehension\r\nin Downing Street had already given trouble during the very short time\r\nwhen Mr. Gladstone was under-secretary at the colonial office; but they\r\nnow broke into the flame of open revolt. The perversity of a foolish\r\nking and weakness and disunion among his whig ministers had brought\r\nabout a catastrophe. At the beginning of the session (1838) the\r\ngovernment introduced a bill suspending the constitution and conferring\r\nvarious absolute powers on Lord Durham as governor general and high\r\ncommissioner. It was in connection with this proposal that Mr. Gladstone\r\nseems to have been first taken into the confidential consultations of\r\nthe leaders of his party.\r\n\r\n                           CANADIAN SPEECH\r\n\r\nThe sage marshalling and manoeuvring of the parliamentary squads was\r\nembarrassed by a move from Sir William Molesworth, of whom we have just\r\nbeen hearing, the editor of Hobbes, and one of the group nicknamed\r\nphilosophic radicals with whom Mr. Gladstone at this stage seldom or\r\nnever agreed. 'The new school of morals,' he called them, 'which taught\r\nthat success was the only criterion of merit,'--a delineation for which\r\nhe would have been severely handled by Bentham or James Mill. Molesworth\r\ngave notice of a vote of censure on Lord Glenelg, the colonial minister;\r\nthat is, he selected a single member of the cabinet for condemnation, on\r\nthe ground of acts for which all the other ministers were collectively\r\njust as responsible. For this discrimination the only precedent seems to\r\nbe Fox's motion against Lord Sandwich in 1779. Mr. Gladstone's\r\nmemorandum[77] completes or modifies the account of the dilemma of the\r\nconservative leader, already known from Sir Robert Peel's papers,[78]\r\nand the reader will find it elsewhere. It was the right of a\r\nconservative opposition to challenge a whig ministry; yet to fight under\r\nradical colours was odious and intolerable. On the other hand he could\r\nnot vote for Molesworth, because he thought him unjust; but he could not\r\nvote against him, because that would imply confidence in the Canadian\r\npolicy of ministers. A certain conservative contingent would not\r\nacquiesce in support of ministers against Molesworth, or in tame resort\r\nto the previous question. Again, Peel felt or feigned an apprehension\r\nthat if by aggressive action they beat the government, a conservative\r\nministry must come in, and he did not think that such a ministry could\r\nlast. Even at this risk, it became clear that the only way of avoiding\r\nthe difficulty was an amendment to Molesworth's motion from the official\r\nopposition. Mr. Gladstone spoke (Mar. 7), and was described as making\r\nhis points with admirable precision and force, though 'with something of\r\na provincial manner, like the rust to a piece of powerful steel\r\nmachinery that has not worked into polish.' The debate, on which such\r\nmighty issues were thought to hang, lasted a couple of nights with not\r\nmore than moderate spirit. At the close the amendment was thrown out by\r\na majority of twenty-nine for ministers. The general result was to\r\nmoderate the impatience of the Carlton Club men, who wished to see their\r\nparty in, on the one hand; and of the radical men, who did not object to\r\nhaving the whigs out, on the other. It showed that neither\r\nadministration nor opposition was in a station of supreme command.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nAt the end of March Mr. Gladstone produced the strongest impression that\r\nhe had yet made in parliament, and he now definitely took his place in\r\nthe front rank. It was on the old embarrassment of slavery. Reports from\r\nthe colonies showed that in some at least, and more particularly in\r\nJamaica, the apprenticeship system had led to harsher treatment of the\r\nnegroes than under slavery. As it has been well put, the bad planters\r\nregarded their slave-apprentices as a bad farmer regards a farm near the\r\nend of an expiring term. In 1836 Buxton moved for a select committee to\r\ninquire into the working of the system. Mr. Gladstone defended it, and\r\nhe warned parliament against 'incautious and precipitate anticipations\r\nof entire success' (March 22). Six days later he was appointed a member\r\nof the apprenticeship committee which at once began to investigate the\r\ncomplaints from Jamaica. Mr. Gladstone acted as the representative of\r\nthe planters on the committee, and he paid very close attention to the\r\nproceedings during two sessions. In the spring of 1838 a motion was made\r\nto accelerate by two years the end of the apprenticeship system on the\r\nslave plantations of the West Indies. Brougham had been raising a\r\ntempest of humane sentiment by more than one of his most magnificent\r\nspeeches. The leading men on both sides in parliament were openly and\r\nstrongly against a disturbance of the settlement, but the feeling in the\r\nconstituencies was hot, and in liberal and tory camp alike members in\r\nfear and trembling tried to make up their minds. Sir George Grey made an\r\neffective case for the law as it stood, and Peel spoke on the same side;\r\nbut it was agreed that Mr. Gladstone, by his union of fervour,\r\nelevation, and a complete mastery of the facts of the case, went deeper\r\nthan either. Even unwilling witnesses 'felt bound to admit the great\r\nability he displayed.' His address was completely that of an advocate,\r\nand he did not even affect to look on both sides of the question,\r\nexpressing his joy that the day had at length arrived when he could meet\r\nthe charges against the planters and enter upon their defence.\r\n\r\n     _March 30th._--Spoke from 11 to 1. Received with the greatest and\r\n     most affecting kindness from, all parties, both during and after.\r\n     Through the debate I felt the most painful depression. Except Mr.\r\n     Plumptre and Lord John Russell, all who spoke damaged the question\r\n     to the utmost possible degree. Prayer earnest for the moment was\r\n     wrung from me in my necessity; I hope it was not a blasphemous\r\n     prayer, for support in pleading the cause of justice.... I am half\r\n     insensible even in the moment of delight to such pleasures as this\r\n     kind of occasion affords. But this is a dangerous state;\r\n     indifference to the world is not love of God....\r\n\r\n                            SPEECH ON SLAVERY\r\n\r\nIn writing to him upon this speech, Mr. Stephen, his former ally at the\r\ncolonial office, addressed an admonition, which is worth, recalling both\r\nfor its own sake and because it hits by anticipation what was to be one\r\nof the most admirable traits in the mighty parliamentarian to whom it\r\nwas written. 'It seems to me,' says Stephen, 'that this part of your\r\nspeech establishes nothing more than the fact that your opponents are\r\ncapricious in the distribution of their sympathy, which is, after all, a\r\nreproach and nothing more. Now, reproach is not only not your strength,\r\nbut it is the very thing in the disuse of which your strength consists;\r\nand indulging as I do the hope that you will one day occupy one of the\r\nforemost stations in the House of Commons, if not the first of all, I\r\ncannot help wishing that you may also be the founder of a more\r\nmagnanimous system of parliamentary tactics than has ever yet been\r\nestablished, in which recrimination will be condemned as unbefitting\r\nwise men and good Christians.' In an assembly for candid deliberation\r\nmodified by party spirit, this is, I fear, almost as much a counsel of\r\nperfection as it would have been in a school of Roman gladiators, but at\r\nany rate it points the better way. The speech itself has a close,\r\ndirect, sinewy quality, a complete freedom from anything vague or\r\ninvolved; and shows for the first time a perfect mastery of the art of\r\nhandling detail upon detail without an instant of tediousness, and\r\nholding the attention of listeners sustained and unbroken. It was a\r\nremonstrance against false allegations of the misbehaviour of the\r\nplanters since the emancipating act, but there is not a trace of\r\nbacksliding upon the great issue. 'We joined in passing the measure; we\r\ndeclared a belief that slavery was an evil and demoralising state, and\r\n_a desire to be relieved from it_; we accepted a price in composition\r\nfor the loss which was expected to accrue.'\r\n\r\nNeither now or at any time did Mr. Gladstone set too low a value on that\r\ngreat dead-lift effort, not too familiar in history, to heave off a\r\nburden from the conscience of the nation, and set back the bounds of\r\ncruel wrong upon the earth. On the day after this performance, the entry\r\nin his diary is--'In the morning my father was greatly overcome, and I\r\ncould hardly speak to him. Now is the time to turn this attack into\r\nmeasures of benefit for the negroes.' More than once in the course of\r\nthe spring he showed how much in earnest he was about the negroes, by\r\nstrenuously pressing his father to allow him to go to the West Indies\r\nand view the state of things there for himself. Perhaps by prudent\r\ninstinct his father disapproved, and at last spoke decidedly against any\r\nproject of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe question of the education of the people was rising into political\r\nprominence, and its close relations with the claims of the church\r\nsufficed to engage the active interest of so zealous a son of the church\r\nas Mr. Gladstone. From a very early stage we find him moving for\r\nreturns, serving on education committees in parliament, corresponding\r\nenergetically with Manning, Acland, and others of like mind in and out\r\nof parliament. Primary education is one of the few subjects on which the\r\nfossils of extinct opinion neither interest nor instruct. It is enough\r\nto mark that Mr. Gladstone's position in the forties was that of the\r\nultra-churchman of the time, and such as no church-ultra now dreams of\r\nfighting for. We find him 'objecting to any infringement whatever of the\r\nprinciple on which the established church was founded--that of confining\r\nthe pecuniary support of the state to one particular religious\r\ndenomination.'[79]\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Hook (March 12, 1838), he speaks of 'a safe and precious\r\ninterval, perhaps the last to those who are desirous of placing the\r\neducation of the people under the efficient control of the clergy.' The\r\naims of himself and his allies were to plant training schools in every\r\ndiocese; to connect these with the cathedrals through the chapters; to\r\nlicense the teachers by the bishops after examination.\r\n\r\nWriting to Manning (Feb. 22, 1839), he compares control by government to\r\nthe 'little lion cub in the _Agamemnon_,' which after being in its\r\nprimeval season the delight of the young and amusement of the old,\r\ngradually revealed its parent stock, and grew to be a creature of huge\r\nmischief in the household.[80] He describes a divergence of view among\r\nthem on the question whether the clergyman should have his choice as to\r\n'admitting the children of dissenters without at once teaching them the\r\ncatechism.' How Mr. Gladstone went he does not say, nor does it matter.\r\nHe was not yet thirty. He accepted his political toryism on authority\r\nand in good faith, and the same was true of his views on church policy.\r\nHe could not foresee that it was to be in his own day of power that the\r\ncub should come out full-grown lion.\r\n\r\n                             IN SOCIETY\r\n\r\nHis work did not prevent him from mixing pretty freely with men in\r\nsociety, though he seems to have thought that little of what passed was\r\nworth transcribing, nor in truth had Mr. Gladstone ever much or any of\r\nthe rare talent of the born diarist. Here are one or two miscellanea\r\nwhich must be made to serve:--\r\n\r\n     _April 25/38._--A long sitting and conversation with Mr. Rogers\r\n     after the Milnes' marriage breakfast. He spoke unfavourably of\r\n     Bulwer; well of Milnes' verses; said his father wished them not to\r\n     be published, because such authorship and its repute would clash\r\n     with the parliamentary career of his son. Mr. Rogers thought a\r\n     great author would undoubtedly stand better in parliament from\r\n     being such; but that otherwise the additament of authorship, unless\r\n     on germane subjects, would be a hindrance. He quoted Swift on\r\n     women.... He has a good and tender opinion of them; but went nearly\r\n     the length of Maurice (when mentioned to him) that they had not\r\n     that specific faculty of understanding which lies beneath the\r\n     reason. Peel was odd, in the contrast of a familiar first address,\r\n     with slackness of manner afterwards. The Duke of Wellington took\r\n     the greatest interest in the poor around him at Strathfieldsay, had\r\n     all of eloquence except the words. Mr. Rogers quoted a saying about\r\n     Brougham that he was not so much a master of the language as\r\n     mastered by it. I doubt very much the truth of this. Brougham's\r\n     management of his sentences, as I remember the late Lady Canning\r\n     observing to me, is surely most wonderful. He never loses the\r\n     thread, and yet he habitually twists it into a thousand varieties\r\n     of intricate form. He said, when Stanley came out in public life,\r\n     and at the age of thirty, he was by far the cleverest young man of\r\n     the day; and at sixty he would be the same, still by far the\r\n     cleverest young man of the day.\r\n\r\n                        PROGRESS IN PUBLIC LIFE\r\n\r\n     _June 13th._--Sir R. Peel dined at Mr. Dugdale's. After dinner he\r\n     spoke of Wilberforce; believed him to be an excellent man\r\n     independently of the book, or would not have been favourably\r\n     impressed by the records of his being in society, and then going\r\n     home and describing as lost in sin those with whom he had been\r\n     enjoying himself. Upon the other hand, however, he would have\r\n     exposed himself to the opposite reproach had he been more secluded,\r\n     morosely withdrawing himself from the range of human sympathies. He\r\n     remembered him as an admirable speaker; agreed that the results of\r\n     his life were very great (and the man must be in part measured by\r\n     them). He disapproved of taking people to task by articles in the\r\n     papers, for votes against their party.\r\n\r\n     _July 18th._--I complimented the Speaker yesterday on the time he\r\n     had saved by putting an end to discussions upon the presentation of\r\n     petitions. He replied that there was a more important advantage;\r\n     that those discussions very greatly increased the influence of\r\n     popular feeling on the deliberations of the House; and that by\r\n     stopping them he thought a wall was erected against such\r\n     influence--not as strong as might be wished. Probably some day it\r\n     might be broken down, but he had done his best to raise it. His\r\n     maxim was to shut out as far as might be all extrinsic pressure,\r\n     and then to do freely what was right within doors.\r\n\r\nThis high and sound way of regarding parliament underwent formidable\r\nchanges before the close of Mr. Gladstone's career, and perhaps his\r\ncareer had indirectly something to do with them. But not, I think, with\r\nintention. In 1838 he cited with approval an exclamation of Roebuck's in\r\nthe House of Commons, 'We, sir, are or ought to be the _elite_ of the\r\npeople of England for mind: we are at the head of the mind of the people\r\nof England.'\r\n\r\n                        EXPECTATIONS OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's position in parliament and the public judgment, as the\r\nsession went on, is sufficiently manifest from a letter addressed to him\r\nat this time by Samuel Wilberforce, four years his junior, henceforth\r\none of his nearest friends, and always an acute observer of social and\r\npolitical forces. 'It would be an affectation in you, which you are\r\nabove,' writes the future bishop (April 20, 1838), 'not to know that few\r\nyoung men have the weight you have in the H. of C. and are gaining\r\nrapidly throughout the country.... I want to urge you to look calmly\r\nbefore you, ... and act now with a view to _then_. There is no height to\r\nwhich you may not fairly rise in this country. If it pleases God to\r\nspare us violent convulsions and the loss of our liberties, you may at a\r\nfuture day wield the whole government of this land; and if this should\r\nbe so, of what extreme moment will your _past steps_ then be to the real\r\nusefulness of your high station.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] Parker's _Peel_, ii. p. 321.\r\n\r\n[72] The _Standard_ marks it 'as a brilliant and triumphant\r\nargument--one of the few gems that have illuminated the reformed House\r\nof Commons.'\r\n\r\n[73] 'Motions and Means on Land and Sea at War,' v. 248. Steamboats,\r\nViaducts, and Railways.\r\n\r\n[74] Thomson, 4127; Philips, 3759; Gladstone, 2324.\r\n\r\n[75] In this speech he dealt with an attack made upon him by his\r\nopponent, Poulett Thomson, afterwards Lord Sydenham, on the question of\r\nnegro slavery:--\r\n\r\n'I have had some obloquy cast upon me by Mr. Thomson, in reference to\r\nthe part which I took in the question of negro slavery. Now, if there\r\nwas ever a question upon which I would desire to submit all that I have\r\never said to a candid inquirer, it is that of negro slavery. He should\r\ntry me in opposition to Lord Stanley, and did Lord Stanley complain? It\r\nis well known that he stated that the only two speeches which were\r\ndecidedly hostile to that measure were delivered by two gentlemen who\r\nhold office under her majesty's present government, whilst, on the\r\ncontrary, his lordship was pleased to express candidly his high\r\napprobation of my sentiments, and my individual exertions for the\r\nsettlement of that matter. Does Mr. Thomson mean to say that the great\r\nconservative body in parliament has offered opposition to that measure?\r\nWho, I would ask, conducted the correspondence of the government office\r\nwith reference to that important question? Will any man who knows the\r\ncharacter of Lord Bathurst--will any man who knows the character of Mr.\r\nStephen, the under-secretary for the colonies--the chosen assistant of\r\nthe noble lord in that ministry of which he was no unimportant\r\nmember--will any man say that Mr. Stephen, who was all along the\r\nadvocate of the slaves, with his liberal and enlightened views,\r\nexercised an influence less than under Lord Stanley? Does Mr. Thomson\r\npresume to state that Lord Aberdeen was guilty of neglect to the slaves?\r\nWhen I add that the question underwent a considerable discussion last\r\nyear, in the House of Commons, when all parties and all interests were\r\nfairly represented, and the best disposition was evinced to assist the\r\nproper working of the measure, and to alter some parts that were\r\nconsidered injurious to the slaves, and which had come under the\r\nimmediate cognisance of the conservative party, is it fair, is it just,\r\nthat a minister of the crown should take advantage, for electioneering\r\npurposes, of the fact that my connections have an interest in the West\r\nIndies, to throw discredit upon me and the cause which I advocate?'\r\n\r\n[76] Parker's _Peel_, ii. pp. 336-8.\r\n\r\n[77] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[78] Parker, ii. pp. 352-367.\r\n\r\n[79] _Hansard_, June 20, 1839.\r\n\r\n[80] _Agam._ 696-716.\r\n\r\n  Even so belike might one\r\n  A lion suckling nurse,\r\n  Like a foster-son,\r\n  To his home a future curse.\r\n\r\n  In life's beginnings mild\r\n  Dear to sire and kind to child....\r\n  But in time he showed\r\n  The habit of his blood....\r\n          --Gladstone in _Translations_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                              THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n                               (_1838_)\r\n\r\n     A period and a movement certainly among the most remarkable in the\r\n     Christendom of the last three and a half centuries; probably more\r\n     remarkable than the movement associated with the name of Port\r\n     Royal, for that has passed away and left hardly a trace behind; but\r\n     this has left ineffaceable marks upon the English church and\r\n     nation.--GLADSTONE (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the affinity of great natures for great issues that made Mr.\r\nGladstone from his earliest manhood onwards take and hold fast the\r\naffairs of the churches for the objects of his most absorbing interest.\r\nHe was one and the same man, his genius was one. His persistent\r\nincursions all through his long life into the multifarious doings, not\r\nonly of his own anglican communion, but of the Latin church of the west,\r\nas well as of the motley Christendom of the east, puzzled and vexed\r\npolitical whippers-in, wire-pullers, newspaper editors, leaders,\r\ncolleagues; they were the despair of party caucuses; and they made the\r\nneutral man of the world smile, as eccentricities of genius and rather\r\nsingularly chosen recreations. All this was, in truth, of the very\r\nessence of his character, the manifestation of its profound unity.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel upon church comprehension that had perplexed Elizabeth and\r\nBurleigh, had distracted the councils of Charles I. and of Cromwell, had\r\nbewildered William of Orange and Tillotson and Burnet, was once more\r\naglow with its old heat. The still mightier dispute, how wide or how\r\nnarrow is the common ground between the church of England and the church\r\nof Rome, broke into fierce flame.\r\n\r\n                       THE RELIGIOUS QUESTION\r\n\r\nThen by and by these familiar contests of ancient tradition, thus\r\nquickened in the eternal ebb and flow of human things into fresh\r\nvitality, were followed by a revival, with new artillery and larger\r\nstrategy, of a standing war that is roughly described as the conflict\r\nbetween reason and faith, between science and revelation. The\r\ncontroversy of Laudian divines with puritans, of Hoadly with non-jurors,\r\nof Hanoverian divines with deists and free-thinkers, all may seem now to\r\nus narrow and dry when compared with such a drama, of so many\r\ninteresting characters, strange evolutions, and multiple and startling\r\nclimax, as gradually unfolded itself to Mr. Gladstone's ardent and\r\nimpassioned gaze.\r\n\r\nHis is not one of the cases, like Pascal, or Baxter, or Rutherford, or a\r\nhundred others, where a man's theological history is to the world,\r\nhowever it may seem to himself, the most important aspect of his career\r\nor character. This is not the place for an exploration of Mr.\r\nGladstone's strictly theological history, nor is mine the hand by which\r\nsuch exploration could be attempted. In the sphere of dogmatic faith,\r\napart from ecclesiastical politics and all the war of principles\r\nconnected with such politics, Mr. Gladstone, by the time when he was\r\nthirty, had become a man of settled questions. Nor was he for his own\r\npart, with a remarkable exception in respect of one particular doctrine\r\ntowards the end of his life, ever ready to re-open them. What is\r\nextraordinary in the career of this far-shining and dominant character\r\nof his age, is not a development of specific opinions on dogma, or\r\ndiscipline, or ordinance, on article or sacrament, but the fact that\r\nwith a steadfast tread he marched along the high anglican road to the\r\nsummits of that liberalism which it was the original object of the new\r\nanglicans to resist and overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe years from 1831 to 1840 Mr. Gladstone marked as an era of a\r\nmarvellous uprising of religious energy throughout the land; it saved\r\nthe church, he says. Not only in Oxford but in England he declares that\r\nparty spirit within the church had fallen to a low ebb. Coming\r\nhurricanes were not foreseen. In Lord Liverpool's government patronage\r\nwas considered to have been respectably dispensed, and church reform\r\nwas never heard of.[81] This dreamless composure was rudely broken. The\r\nrepeal of the test and corporation Acts in 1828 first roused the church;\r\nand her sons rubbed their eyes when they beheld parliament bringing\r\nfrankly to an end the odious monopoly of office under the crown, all\r\ncorporate office, all magistracy, in men willing to take the communion\r\nat the altar of the privileged establishment. The next year a deadlier\r\nblow fell after a more embittered fight--the admission of Roman\r\ncatholics to parliament and place. The Reform bill of 1832 followed.\r\nEven when half spent, the forces that had been gathering for many years\r\nin the direction of parliamentary reform, and had at last achieved more\r\nthan one immense result, rolled heavily forward against the church. The\r\nopening of parliament and of close corporations was taken to involve an\r\nopening to correspond in the grandest and closest of all corporations.\r\nThe resounding victory of the constitutional bill of 1832 was followed\r\nby a drastic handling of the church in Ireland, and by a proposal to\r\ndivert a surplus of its property to purposes not ecclesiastical. A long\r\nand peculiarly unedifying crisis ensued. Stanley and Graham, two of the\r\nmost eminent members of the reforming whig cabinet, on this proposal at\r\nonce resigned. The Grey ministry was thus split in 1834, and the Peel\r\nministry ejected in 1835, on the ground of the absolute inviolability of\r\nthe property of the Irish church. The tide of reaction set slowly in.\r\nThe shock in political party was in no long time followed by shock after\r\nshock in the church. As has happened on more than one occasion in our\r\nhistory, alarm for the church kindled the conservative temper in the\r\nnation. Or to put it in another way, that spontaneous attachment to the\r\nold order of things, with all its symbols, institutes, and deep\r\nassociations, which the radical reformers had both affronted and\r\nignored, made the church its rallying-point. The three years of tortuous\r\nproceedings on the famous Appropriation clause--proceedings that\r\npolitical philosophers declared to have disgraced this country in the\r\nface of Europe, and that were certainly an ignominy and a scandal in a\r\nparty called reforming--were among the things that helped most to\r\nprepare the way for the fall of the whigs and the conservative triumph\r\nof 1841. Within ten years from the death of Canning the church\r\ntransfixed the attention of the politician. The Duke of Wellington was\r\nhardly a wizard in political foresight, but he had often a good\r\nsoldier's eye for things that stood straight up in front of him. 'The\r\nreal question,' said the duke in 1838, 'that now divides the country and\r\nwhich truly divides the House of Commons, is church or no church. People\r\ntalk of the war in Spain, and the Canada question. But all that is of\r\nlittle moment. The real question is church or no church.'\r\n\r\n                  CHANGED POSITION OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe position of the tory party as seen by its powerful recruit was, when\r\nhe entered public life, a state of hopeless defeat and discomfiture.\r\n'But in my imagination,' wrote Mr. Gladstone, 'I cast over that party a\r\nprophetic mantle and assigned to it a mission distinctly religious as\r\nthe champion in the state field of that divine truth which it was the\r\noffice of the Christian ministry to uphold in the church. Neither then\r\ndid I, nor now can I, see on what ground this inviolability could for a\r\nmoment be maintained, except the belief that the state had such a\r\nmission.' He soon discovered how hard it is to adjust to the many angles\r\nof an English political party the seamless mantle of ecclesiastical\r\npredominance.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the political constitution in 1828, in 1829, and in 1832,\r\ncarried with them a deliberate recognition that the church was not the\r\nnation; that it was not identical with the parliament who spoke for the\r\nnation; that it had no longer a title to compose the governing order;\r\nand--a more startling disclosure still to the minds of churchmen--that\r\nlaws affecting the church would henceforth be made by men of all\r\nchurches and creeds, or even men of none. This hateful circumstance it\r\nwas that inevitably began in multitudes of devout and earnest minds to\r\nproduce a revolution in their conception of a church, and a resurrection\r\nin curiously altered forms of that old ideal of Milton's austere and\r\nlofty school--the ideal of a purely spiritual association that should\r\nleave each man's soul and conscience free from 'secular chains' and\r\n'hireling wolves.'\r\n\r\n                    CHANGED SOCIAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nStrange social conditions were emerging on every side. The factory\r\nsystem established itself on a startling scale. Huge aggregates of\r\npopulation collected with little regard to antique divisions of diocese\r\nand parish. Colonies over the sea extended in boundaries and numbers,\r\nand churchmen were zealous that these infant societies should be blessed\r\nby the same services, rites, ecclesiastical ordering and exhortation, as\r\nwere believed to elevate and sanctify the parent community at home. The\r\neducation of the people grew to be a formidable problem, the field of\r\nangry battles and campaigns that never end. Trade, markets, wages,\r\nhours, and all the gaunt and haggard economics of the labour question,\r\nadded to the statesman's load. Pauperism was appalling. In a word, the\r\nneed for social regeneration both material and moral was in the spirit\r\nof the time. Here were the hopes, vague, blind, unmeasured, formless,\r\nthat had inspired the wild clamour for the bill, the whole bill, and\r\nnothing but the bill. The whig patricians carried away the prizes of\r\ngreat office, though the work had been done by men of a very different\r\nstamp. It was the utilitarian radicals who laid the foundations of\r\nsocial improvement in a reasoned creed. With admirable ability,\r\nperseverance, unselfishness, and public spirit, Bentham and his\r\ndisciples had regenerated political opinion, and fought the battle\r\nagainst debt, pauperism, class-privilege, class-monopoly, abusive\r\npatronage, a monstrous criminal law, and all the host of sinister\r\ninterests.[82] As in every reforming age, men approached the work from\r\ntwo sides. Evangelical religion divides with rationalism the glory of\r\nmore than one humanitarian struggle. Brougham, a more potent force than\r\nwe now realise, plunged with the energy of a Titan into a thousand\r\nprojects, all taking for granted that ignorance is the disease and\r\nuseful knowledge the universal healer, all of them secular, all dealing\r\nwith man from the outside, none touching imagination or the heart.\r\nMarch-of-mind became to many almost as wearisome a cry as\r\nwisdom-of-our-ancestors had been. According to some eager innovators,\r\ndogma and ceremony were to go, the fabrics to be turned into mechanics'\r\ninstitutes, the clergy to lecture on botany and statistics. The reaction\r\nagainst this dusty dominion of secularity kindled new life in rival\r\nschools. They insisted that if society is to be improved and\r\ncivilisation saved, it can only be through improvement in the character\r\nof man, and character is moulded and inspired by more things than are\r\ndreamed of by societies for useful knowledge. The building up of the\r\ninward man in all his parts, faculties, and aspirations, was seen to be,\r\nwhat in every age it is, the problem of problems. This thought turned\r\nthe eyes of many--of Mr. Gladstone first among them--to the church, and\r\nstirred an endeavour to make out of the church what Coleridge describes\r\nas the sustaining, correcting, befriending opposite of the world, the\r\ncompensating counterforce to the inherent and inevitable defects of the\r\nstate as a state. Such was the new movement of the time between 1835 and\r\n1845.\r\n\r\n'It is surprising,' said Proudhon, the trenchant genius of French\r\nsocialism in 1840 and onwards, 'how at the bottom of our politics we\r\nalways found theology.' It is true at any rate that the association of\r\npolitical and social change with theological revolution was the most\r\nremarkable of all the influences in the first twenty years of Mr.\r\nGladstone's public life. Then rose once more into active prominence the\r\nsupreme debate, often cutting deep into the labours of the modern\r\nstatesman, always near to the heart of the speculations of the\r\ntheologian, in many fields urgent in its interest alike to ecclesiastic,\r\nhistorian, and philosopher, the inquiry: what is a church? This opened\r\nthe sluices and let out the floods. What is the church of England? To\r\nask that question was to ask a hundred others. Creeds, dogmas,\r\nordinances, hierarchy, parliamentary institution, judicial tribunals,\r\nhistorical tradition, the prayer-book, the Bible--all these enormous\r\ntopics sacred and profane, with all their countless ramifications, were\r\nrapidly swept into a tornado of such controversy as had not been seen in\r\nEngland since the Revolution. Was the church a purely human creation,\r\nchanging with time and circumstance, like all the other creations of\r\nthe heart and brain and will of man? Were its bishops mere officers,\r\nlike high ministers of mundane state, or were they, in actual historic\r\ntruth as in supposed theological necessity, the direct lineal successors\r\nof the first apostles, endowed from the beginning with the mystical\r\nprerogatives on which the efficacy of all sacramental rites depended?\r\nWhat were its relations to the councils of the first four centuries,\r\nwhat to the councils of the fifteenth century and the sixteenth, what to\r\nthe Fathers? The Scottish presbyterians held the conception of a church\r\nas strongly as anybody;[83] but England, broadly speaking, had never\r\nbeen persuaded that there could be a church without bishops.\r\n\r\nIn the answers to this group of hard questions, terrible divisions that\r\nhad been long muffled and huddled away burst into view. The stupendous\r\nquarrel of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries again broke out. To\r\nthe erastian lawyer the church was an institution erected on principles\r\nof political expediency by act of parliament. To the school of Whately\r\nand Arnold it was a corporation of divine origin, devised to strengthen\r\nmen in their struggle for goodness and holiness by the association and\r\nmutual help of fellow-believers. To the evangelical it was hardly more\r\nthan a collection of congregations commended in the Bible for the\r\ndiffusion of the knowledge and right interpretation of the Scriptures,\r\nthe commemoration of gospel events, and the linking of gospel truths to\r\na well-ordered life. To the high anglican as to the Roman catholic, the\r\nchurch was something very different from this; not a fabric reared by\r\nman, nor in truth any mechanical fabric at all, but a mystically\r\nappointed channel of salvation, an indispensable element in the relation\r\nbetween the soul of man and its creator. To be a member of it was not to\r\njoin an external association, but to become an inward partaker in\r\nineffable and mysterious graces to which no other access lay open. Such\r\nwas the Church Catholic and Apostolic as set up from the beginning, and\r\nof this immense mystery, of this saving agency, of this incommensurable\r\nspiritual force, the established church of England was the local\r\npresence and the organ.\r\n\r\n                       HARD QUESTIONS REVIVED\r\n\r\nThe noble restlessness of the profounder and more penetrating minds was\r\nnot satisfied, any more than Bossuet had been, to think of the church as\r\nonly an element in a scheme of individual salvation. They sought in it\r\nthe comprehensive solution of all the riddles of life and time. Newman\r\ndrew in powerful outline the sublime and sombre anarchy of human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThis is the enigma, this the solution in faith and spirit, in which Mr.\r\nGladstone lived and moved. In him it gave to the energies of life their\r\nmeaning, and to duty its foundation. While poetic voices and the oracles\r\nof sages--Goethe, Scott, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron, Coleridge--were\r\ndrawing men one way or another, or else were leaving the void turbid and\r\nformless, he, in the midst of doubts, distractions, and fears, saw a\r\nsteadfast light where the Oxford men saw it; in that concrete\r\nrepresentation of the unseen Power that, as he believed, had made and\r\nguides and rules the world, in that Church Catholic and Apostolic which\r\nalone would have the force and the stoutness necessary to serve for a\r\nbreakwater against the deluge. Yet to understand Mr. Gladstone's case,\r\nwe have ever to remember that what is called the catholic revival was\r\nnot in England that which the catholic counter-revolution had been on\r\nthe continent of Europe, primarily a political movement. Its workings\r\nwere inward, in the sphere of the mind, in thought and faith, in\r\nidealised associations of historic grandeur.[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                          HIS RELIGIOUS GROWTH\r\n\r\nThe reader has already been told how at Rome and in Naples in 1832, Mr.\r\nGladstone was suddenly arrested by the new idea of a church,\r\ninterweaving with the whole of human life a pervading and equalised\r\nspirit of religion. Long years after, in an unfinished fragment, he\r\nbegan to trace the golden thread of his religious growth:--\r\n\r\n     My environment in my childhood was strictly evangelical. My dear\r\n     and noble mother was a woman of warm piety but broken health, and I\r\n     was not directly instructed by her. But I was brought up to believe\r\n     that Doyly and Mant's Bible (then a standard book of the colour\r\n     ruling in the church) was heretical, and that every unitarian (I\r\n     suppose also every heathen) must, as matter of course, be lost\r\n     forever. This deplorable servitude of mind oppressed me in a\r\n     greater or less degree for a number of years. As late as in the\r\n     year (I think) 1836, one of my brothers married a beautiful and in\r\n     every way charming person, who had been brought up in a family of\r\n     the unitarian profession, yet under a mother very sincerely\r\n     religious. I went through much mental difficulty and distress at\r\n     the time, as there had been no express renunciation [by her] of the\r\n     ancestral creed, and I absurdly busied myself with devising this or\r\n     that religious test as what if accepted might suffice.[85]\r\n\r\n     So, as will be seen, the first access of churchlike ideas to my\r\n     mind by no means sufficed to expel my inherited and bigoted\r\n     misconception, though in the event they did it as I hope\r\n     effectively. But I long retained in my recollection an observation\r\n     made to me in (I think) the year 1829, by Mrs. Benjamin Gaskell of\r\n     Thornes, near Wakefield, a seed which was destined long to remain\r\n     in my mind without germinating. I fell into religious conversation\r\n     with this excellent woman, the mother of my Eton friend Milnes\r\n     Gaskell, himself the husband of an unitarian. She said to me,\r\n     Surely we cannot entertain a doubt as to the future condition of\r\n     any person truly united to Christ by faith and love, whatever may\r\n     be the faults of his opinions. Here she supplied me with the key to\r\n     the whole question. At this hour I feel grateful to her\r\n     accordingly, for the scope of her remark is very wide; and it is\r\n     now my rule to remember her in prayer before the altar.\r\n\r\n     There was nothing at Eton to subvert this frame of mind; for\r\n     nothing was taught us either for it or against it. But in the\r\n     spring and summer of 1828, I set to work on Hooker's\r\n     _Ecclesiastical Polity_, and read it straight through. Intercourse\r\n     with my elder sister Anne had increased my mental interest in\r\n     religion, and she, though generally of evangelical sentiments, had\r\n     an opinion that the standard divines of the English church were of\r\n     great value. Hooker's exposition of the case of the church of\r\n     England came to me as a mere abstraction; but I think that I found\r\n     the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration, theretofore abhorred,\r\n     impossible to reject, and the way was thus opened for further\r\n     changes.\r\n\r\n     In like manner at Oxford, I do not doubt that in 1830 and 1831 the\r\n     study of Bishop Butler laid the ground for new modes of thought in\r\n     religion, but his teaching in the sermons on our moral nature was\r\n     not integrated, so to speak, until several years later by larger\r\n     perusal of the works of Saint Augustine. I may, however, say that I\r\n     was not of a mind ill disposed to submit to authority.\r\n\r\n     The Oxford Movement, properly so called, began in the year 1833,\r\n     but it had no direct effect upon me. I did not see the Tracts, and\r\n     to this hour I have read but few of them. Indeed, my first\r\n     impressions and emotions in connection with it were those of\r\n     indignation at what I thought the rash intemperate censures\r\n     pronounced by Mr. Hurrell Froude upon the reformers. My chief tie\r\n     with Oxford was the close friendship I had formed in 1830 with\r\n     Walter Hamilton.[86] His character, always loving and loved, had,\r\n     not very greatly later, become deeply devout. But I do not think he\r\n     at this time sympathised with Newman and his friends; and he had\r\n     the good sense, in conjunction with Mr. Denison, afterwards bishop,\r\n     to oppose the censure upon Dr. Hampden, to which I foolishly and\r\n     ignorantly gave in, without, however, being an active or important\r\n     participator.\r\n\r\n     But the blow struck by the prayer-book in 1832 set my mind in\r\n     motion, and that motion was never arrested. I found food for the\r\n     new ideas and tendencies in various quarters, not least in the\r\n     religious writings of Alexander Knox, all of which I perused.\r\n     Moreover, I had an inclination to ecclesiastical conformity, and\r\n     obedience as such, which led me to concur with some zeal in the\r\n     plans of Bishop Blomfield. In the course of two or three years,\r\n     Manning turned from a strongly evangelical attitude to one as\r\n     strongly anglican, and about the same time converted his\r\n     acquaintance with me into a close friendship. In the same manner\r\n     James Hope, whom I had known but slightly at Eton or Oxford, made a\r\n     carefully considered change of the same kind; which also became the\r\n     occasion of a fast friendship. Both these intimacies led me\r\n     forward; Hope especially had influence over me, more than I think\r\n     any other person at any period of my life.[87]\r\n\r\n     When I was preparing in 1837-8 _The State in its Relations with the\r\n     Church_, he took a warm interest in the work, which, during my\r\n     absence on the continent, he corrected for the press. His attitude\r\n     towards the work, however, included a desire that its propositions\r\n     should be carried further. The temper of the times among young\r\n     educated men was working in the same direction. I had no low\r\n     churchmen among my near friends, except Walter Farquhar. Anstice, a\r\n     great loss, died very early in his beautiful married life. While I\r\n     was busy about my book, Hope made known to me Palmer's work on the\r\n     Church, which had just appeared. I read it with care and great\r\n     interest. It took hold upon me; and gave me at once the clear,\r\n     definite, and strong conception of the church which, through all\r\n     the storm and strain of a most critical period, has proved for me\r\n     entirely adequate to every emergency, and saved me from all\r\n     vacillation. I did not, however, love the extreme rigour of the\r\n     book in its treatment of non-episcopal communions. It was not very\r\n     long after this, I think in 1842, that I reduced into form my\r\n     convictions of the large and important range of subjects which\r\n     recent controversy had brought into prominence. I conceive that in\r\n     the main Palmer completed for me the work which inspection of the\r\n     prayer-book had begun.\r\n\r\n     Before referring further to my 'redaction' of opinions, I desire to\r\n     say that at this moment I am as closely an adherent to the\r\n     doctrines of grace generally, and to the general sense of Saint\r\n     Augustine, as at the date from which this narrative set out. I hope\r\n     that my mind has dropped nothing affirmative. But I hope also that\r\n     there has been dropped from it all the damnatory part of the\r\n     opinions taught by the evangelical school; not only as regards the\r\n     Roman catholic religion, but also as to heretics and heathens;\r\n     nonconformists and presbyterians I think that I always let off\r\n     pretty easily....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\n                       INFLUENCE OF FRIENDS AND BOOKS\r\n\r\nThe Tractarian movement is by this time one of the most familiar\r\nchapters in our history, and it has had singular good fortune in being\r\ntold by three masters of the most winning, graphic, and melodious\r\nEnglish prose of the century to which the tale belongs.[88] Whether we\r\ncall it by the ill name of Oxford counter-reformation or the friendlier\r\nname of catholic revival, it remains a striking landmark in the varied\r\nmotions of English religious thought and feeling for the three-quarters\r\nof a century since the still unfinished journey first began. In its\r\nearly stages, the movement was exclusively theological. Philanthropic\r\nreform still remained with the evangelical school that so powerfully\r\nhelped to sweep away the slave trade, cleansed the prisons, and aided in\r\nhumanising the criminal law. It was they who 'helped to form a\r\nconscience, if not a heart, in the callous bosom of English politics,'\r\nwhile the very foremost of the Oxford divines was scouting the fine talk\r\nabout black men, because they 'concentrated in themselves all the\r\nwhiggery, dissent, cant, and abomination that had been ranged on their\r\nside.'[89] Nor can we forget that Shaftesbury, the leader in that\r\nbeneficent crusade of human mercy and national wisdom which ended in the\r\ndeliverance of women and children in mines and factories, was also a\r\nleader of the evangelical party.\r\n\r\nThe Tractarian movement, as all know, opened, among other sources, in\r\nantagonism to utilitarian liberalism. Yet J. S. Mill, the oracle of\r\nrationalistic liberalism in Oxford and other places in the following\r\ngeneration, had always much to say for the Tractarians. He used to tell\r\nus that the Oxford theologians had done for England something like what\r\nGuizot, Villemain, Michelet, Cousin had done a little earlier for\r\nFrance; they had opened, broadened, deepened the issues and meanings of\r\nEuropean history; they had reminded us that history is European; that it\r\nis quite unintelligible if treated as merely local. He would say,\r\nmoreover, that thought should recognise thought and mind always welcome\r\nmind; and the Oxford men had at least brought argument, learning, and\r\neven philosophy of a sort, to break up the narrow and frigid conventions\r\nof reigning system in church and college, in pulpits and professorial\r\nchairs. They had made the church ashamed of the evil of her ways, they\r\nhad determined that spirit of improvement from within 'which, if this\r\nsect-ridden country is ever really to be taught, must proceed _pari\r\npassu_ with assault from without.'[90]\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest of the Oxford writers talking of the non-jurors,\r\nremarks how very few of the movements that are attended with a certain\r\nromance, and thus bias us for a time in their favour, will stand full\r\nexamination; they so often reveal some gross offence against common\r\nsense.[91] Want of common sense is not the particular impression left by\r\nthe Tractarians, after we have put aside the plausible dialectic and\r\nwinning periods of the leader, and proceed to look at the effect, not on\r\ntheir general honesty but on their intellectual integrity, of their most\r\npeculiar situation and the methods which they believed that situation to\r\nimpose. Nobody will be so presumptuous or uncharitable as to deny that\r\namong the divines of the Oxford movement were men as pure in soul, as\r\nfervid lovers of truth, as this world ever possessed. On the other hand\r\nit would be nothing short of a miracle in human nature, if all that\r\ndreadful tangle of economies and reserves, so largely practised and for\r\na long time so insidiously defended, did not familiarise a vein of\r\nsubtlety, a tendency to play fast and loose with words, a perilous\r\ndisposition to regard the non-natural sense of language as if it were\r\njust as good as the natural, a willingness to be satisfied with a bare\r\nand rigid logical consistency of expression, without respect to the\r\ninterpretation that was sure to be put upon that expression by the\r\nhearer and the reader. The strain of their position in all these\r\nrespects made Newman and his allies no exemplary school. Their example\r\nhas been, perhaps rightly, held to account for something that was often\r\nunder the evil name of sophistry suspected and disliked in Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself, in his speeches, his writings, and even in his public acts.\r\n\r\n            MISCHIEVOUS EFFECTS OF OXFORD ENTANGLEMENTS\r\n\r\nIt is true that to the impartial eye Newman is no worse than teachers in\r\nantagonistic sects; he is, for instance, no subtler than Maurice. The\r\ntheologian who strove so hard in the name of anglican unity to develop\r\nall the catholic elements and hide out of sight all the calvinistic, was\r\nnot driven to any hardier exploits of verbal legerdemain, than the\r\ntheologian who strove against all reason and clear thinking to devise\r\ncommon formulae that should embrace both catholic and calvinistic\r\nexplanations together, or indeed anything else that anybody might choose\r\nto bring to the transfusing alchemy of his rather smoky crucible. Nor\r\nwas the third, and at that moment the strongest, of the church parties\r\nat Oxford and in the country, well able to fling stones at the other\r\ntwo. What better right, it was asked, had low churchmen to shut their\r\neyes to the language of rubrics, creeds, and offices, than the high\r\nchurchmen had to twist the language of the articles?\r\n\r\nThe confusion was grave and it was unfathomable. Newman fought a skilful\r\nand persistent fight against liberalism, as being nothing else than the\r\negregious doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, and that\r\none creed is as good as another. Dr. Arnold, on the other hand,\r\ndenounced Newmanism as idolatry; declared that if you let in the little\r\nfinger of tradition, you would soon have in the whole monster, horns and\r\ntail and all; and even complained of the English divines in general,\r\nwith the noble exceptions of Butler and Hooker, that he found in them a\r\nwant of believing or disbelieving anything because it was true or false,\r\nas if that were a question that never occurred to them.[92] The plain\r\nman, who was but a poor master either of theology or of the history of\r\nthe church of England, but who loved the prayer-book and hated\r\nconfession, convents, priest-craft, and mariolatry, was wrought to\r\nmadness by a clergyman who should describe himself, as did R. H. Froude,\r\nas a catholic without the popery, and a church of England man without\r\nthe protestantism. The plain man knew that he was not himself clever\r\nenough to form any distinct idea of what such talk meant. But then his\r\nhelplessness only deepened his conviction that the more distinct his\r\nidea might become, the more intense would his aversion be, both to the\r\nthing meant and to the surpliced conjurer who, as he bitterly supposed,\r\nwas by sophistic tricks trying hard to take him in.\r\n\r\nOther portents were at the same time beginning to disturb the world. The\r\nfinds and the theories of geologists made men uncomfortable, and brought\r\ndown sharp anathemas. Wider speculations on cosmic and creative law came\r\nsoon after, and found their way into popular reading.[93] In prose\r\nliterature, in subtler forms than the verse of Shelley, new dissolving\r\nelements appeared that were destined to go far. Schleiermacher, between\r\n1820 and 1830, opened the sluices of the theological deep, whether to\r\ndeluge or to irrigate. In 1830 an alarming note was sounded in the\r\npublication by a learned clergyman of a history of the Jews. We have\r\nseen (p. 56) how Mr. Gladstone was horrified by it. Milman's book was\r\nthe beginning of a new rationalism within the fold. A line of thought\r\nwas opened that seemed to make the history of religious ideas more\r\ninteresting than their truth. The special claims of an accepted creed\r\nwere shaken by disclosing an unmistakeable family likeness to creeds\r\nabhorred. A belief was deemed to be accounted for and its sanctity\r\ndissolved, by referring it historically to human origins, and showing it\r\nto be only one branch of a genealogical trunk. Historic explanation\r\nbecame a graver peril than direct attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                        NEW IDEAS AND TENDENCIES\r\n\r\nThe first skirmish in a dire conflict that is not even now over or near\r\nits end happened in 1836. Lord Melbourne recommended for the chair of\r\ndivinity at Oxford Dr. Hampden, a divine whose clumsy handling of nice\r\nthemes had brought him, much against his intention, under suspicion of\r\nunsound doctrine, and who was destined eleven years later to find\r\nhimself the centre of a still louder uproar. Evangelicals and\r\nTractarians flew to arms, and the two hosts who were soon to draw their\r\nswords upon one another, now for the first time, if not the last,\r\nswarmed forth together side by side against the heretic. What was rather\r\nan affront than a penalty was inflicted upon Hampden by a majority of\r\nsome five to one of the masters of arts of the university, and in accord\r\nwith that majority, as he has just told us, though he did not actually\r\nvote, was Mr. Gladstone. Twenty years after, when he had risen to be a\r\nshining light in the world's firmament, he wrote to Hampden to express\r\nregret for the injustice of which in this instance 'the forward\r\nprecipitancy of youth' had made him guilty.[94] The case of Hampden gave\r\na sharp actuality to the question of the relations of church and crown.\r\nThe particular quarrel was of secondary importance, but it brought home\r\nto the high churchmen what might be expected in weightier matters than\r\nthe affair of Dr. Hampden from whig ministers, and confirmed the\r\nhorrible apprehension that whig ministers might possibly have to fill\r\nall the regius chairs and all the sees for a whole generation to come.\r\n\r\nNot less important than the theology of the Oxford divines in its\r\ninfluence on Mr. Gladstone's line of thought upon things ecclesiastical\r\nwas the speculation of Coleridge on the teaching and polity of a\r\nnational church. His fertile book on _Church and State_ was given to the\r\nworld in 1830, four years before his death, and this and the ideas\r\nproceeding from it were the mainspring, if not of the theology of the\r\nmovement, at least of Mr. Gladstone's first marked contribution to the\r\nstirring controversies of the time. He has described the profound effect\r\nupon his mind of another book, the _Treatise on the Church of Christ_,\r\nby William Palmer of Worcester College (1838), and to the end of his\r\nlife it held its place in his mind among the most masterly performances\r\nof the day in the twin hemispheres of theology and church polity.[95]\r\nNewman applauded the book for its magnificence of design, and\r\nundoubtedly it covers much ground, including a stiff rejection of\r\nLocke's theory of toleration, and the assertion of the strong doctrine\r\nthat the Christian prince has a right by temporal penalties to protect\r\nthe church from the gathering together of the froward and the\r\ninsurrection of wicked doers. It has at least the merit, so far from\r\nuniversal in the polemics of that day, of clear language, definite\r\npropositions, and formal arguments capable of being met by a downright\r\nyes or no.[96] The question, however, that has often slumbered yet never\r\ndies, of the right relations between the Christian prince or state and\r\nthe Christian church, was rapidly passing away from logicians of the\r\ncloister.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Note to page 167.\r\n\r\n     '_Hawarden, Chester, November 9, 1856._--MY LORD BISHOP,--Your\r\n     lordship will probably be surprised at receiving a letter from me,\r\n     as a stranger. The simple purpose of it is to discharge a debt of\r\n     the smallest possible importance to you, yet due I think from me,\r\n     by expressing the regret with which I now look back on my\r\n     concurrence in a vote of the University of Oxford in the year 1836,\r\n     condemnatory of some of your lordship's publications. I did not\r\n     take actual part in the vote; but upon reference to a journal kept\r\n     at the time, I find that my absence was owing to an accident.\r\n\r\n     'For a good many years past I have found myself ill able to master\r\n     books of an abstract character, and I am far from pretending to be\r\n     competent at this time to form a judgment on the merits of any\r\n     propositions then at issue. I have learned, indeed, that many\r\n     things which, in the forward precipitancy of my youth, I should\r\n     have condemned, are either in reality sound, or lie within the just\r\n     limits of such discussion as especially befits an University. But\r\n     that which (after a delay, due, I think, to the cares and pressing\r\n     occupations of political life) brought back to my mind the\r\n     injustice of which I had unconsciously been guilty in 1836, was my\r\n     being called upon, as a member of the Council of King's College in\r\n     London, to concur in a measure similar in principle with respect to\r\n     Mr. Maurice; that is to say, in a condemnation couched in general\r\n     terms which did not really declare the point of imputed guilt, and\r\n     against which perfect innocence could have no defence. I resisted\r\n     to the best of my power, though ineffectually, the grievous wrong\r\n     done to Mr. Maurice, and urged that the charges should be made\r\n     distinct, that all the best means of investigation should be\r\n     brought to bear on them, ample opportunity given for defence, and a\r\n     reference then made, if needful, to the Bishop in his proper\r\n     capacity. But the majority of laymen in the Council were\r\n     inexorable. It was only, as I have said, after mature reflection\r\n     that I came to perceive the bearing of the case on that of 1836,\r\n     and to find that by my resistance I had condemned myself. I then\r\n     lamented very sincerely that I had not on that occasion, now so\r\n     remote, felt and acted in a different manner.\r\n\r\n     'I beg your lordship to accept this expression of my cordial\r\n     regret, and to allow me to subscribe myself, very respectfully,\r\n     your obedient and humble servant, W.

But the State, in\r\n     rejecting her, would actively violate its most solemn duty, and\r\n     would, if the theory of the connection be sound, entail upon itself\r\n     a curse.--GLADSTONE (1838).\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Gladstone, a furore for church establishment came down\r\nupon the conservative squadrons between 1835 and 1838. He describes it\r\nas due especially to the activity of the presbyterian established church\r\nof Scotland before the disruption, and especially to the 'zealous and\r\ntruly noble propagandism of Dr. Chalmers, a man with the energy of a\r\ngiant and the simplicity of a child.' In 1837, Mr. Gladstone says in one\r\nof the many fragments written when in his later years he mused over the\r\npast, 'we had a movement for fresh parliamentary grants to build\r\nchurches in Scotland. The leaders did not seem much to like it, but had\r\nto follow. I remember dining at Sir R. Peel's with the Scotch\r\ndeputation. It included Collins, a church bookseller of note, who told\r\nme that no sermon ought ever to fall short of an hour, for in less time\r\nthan that it was not possible to explain any text of the Holy\r\nScripture.'\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1838, the mighty Chalmers was persuaded to cross the\r\nborder and deliver in London half a dozen discourses to vindicate the\r\ncause of ecclesiastical establishments. The rooms in Hanover Square\r\nwere crowded to suffocation by intense audiences mainly composed of the\r\ngoverning class. Princes of the blood were there, high prelates of the\r\nchurch, great nobles, leading statesmen, and a throng of members of the\r\nHouse of Commons, from both sides of it. The orator was seated, but now\r\nand again in the kindling excitement of his thought, he rose\r\nunconsciously to his feet, and by ringing phrase or ardent gesture\r\nroused a whirlwind of enthusiasm such that vehement bystanders assure us\r\nit could not be exceeded in the history of human eloquence.[98] In\r\nChalmers' fulminating energy, the mechanical polemics of an\r\nappropriation clause in a parliamentary bill assume a passionate and\r\nliving air. He had warned his northern flock, 'should the disaster ever\r\nbefall us, of vulgar and upstart politicians becoming lords of the\r\nascendant, and an infidel or demi-infidel government wielding the\r\ndestinies of this mighty empire, and should they be willing at the\r\nshrines of their own wretched partizanship to make sacrifice of those\r\ngreat and hallowed institutions which were consecrated by our ancestors\r\nto the maintenance of religious truth and religious liberty,--should in\r\nparticular the monstrous proposition ever be entertained to abridge the\r\nlegal funds for the support of protestantism,--let us hope that there is\r\nstill enough, not of fiery zeal, but of calm, resolute, enlightened\r\nprinciple in the land to resent the outrage--enough of energy and\r\nreaction in the revolted sense of this great country to meet and\r\noverbear it.'\r\n\r\n                       CHALMERS IN LONDON\r\n\r\nThe impression made by all this on Mr. Gladstone he has himself\r\ndescribed in an autobiographic note of 1897:--\r\n\r\n     The primary idea of my early politics was the church. With this was\r\n     connected the idea of the establishment, as being everything except\r\n     essential. When therefore Dr. Chalmers came to London to lecture on\r\n     the principle of church establishments, I attended as a loyal\r\n     hearer. I had a profound respect for the lecturer, with whom I had\r\n     had the honour of a good deal of acquaintance during winter\r\n     residences in Edinburgh, and some correspondence by letter. I was\r\n     in my earlier twenties, and he near his sixties [he was 58], with\r\n     a high and merited fame for eloquence and character. He subscribed\r\n     his letters to me 'respectfully' (or 'most respectfully') yours,\r\n     and puzzled me extremely in the effort to find out what suitable\r\n     mode of subscription to use in return. Unfortunately the basis of\r\n     his lectures was totally unsound. Parliament as being Christian was\r\n     bound to know and establish the truth. But not being made of\r\n     theologians, it could not follow the truth into its minuter\r\n     shadings, and must proceed upon broad lines. Fortunately these\r\n     lines were ready to hand. There was a religious system which, taken\r\n     in the rough, was truth. This was known as protestantism: and to\r\n     its varieties it was not the business of the legislature to have\r\n     regard. On the other side lay a system which, taken again in the\r\n     rough, was not truth but error. This system was known as popery.\r\n     Parliament therefore was bound to establish and endow some kind of\r\n     protestantism, and not to establish or endow popery.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Manning (May 14, 1838) he puts the case more bluntly:--\r\n\r\n     Such a jumble of church, un-church, and anti-church principles as\r\n     that excellent and eloquent man Dr. Chalmers has given us in his\r\n     recent lectures, no human being ever heard, and it can only be\r\n     compared to the state of things--\r\n\r\n       Ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia coelum.[99]\r\n\r\n     He thinks that the State has not cognisance of spirituals, except\r\n     upon a broad simple principle like that which separates popery from\r\n     protestantism, namely that protestantism receives the word of God\r\n     only, popery the word of God and the word of man alike--it is easy,\r\n     he says, such being the alternatives, to judge which is preferable.\r\n     He flogged the apostolic succession grievously, seven bishops\r\n     sitting below him: London, Winchester, Chester, Oxford, Llandaff,\r\n     Gloucester, Exeter, and the Duke of Cambridge incessantly bobbing\r\n     assent; but for fear we should be annoyed he then turned round on\r\n     the cathedrals plan and flogged it with at least equal vigour. He\r\n     has a mind keenly susceptible of what is beautiful, great, and\r\n     good; tenacious of an idea when once grasped, and with a singular\r\n     power of concentrating the whole man upon it. But unfortunately I\r\n     do not believe he has ever looked in the face the real doctrine of\r\n     the visible church and the apostolic succession, or has any idea\r\n     what is the matter at issue.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone says he could not stand the undisputed currency in\r\nconservative circles of a theory like this, and felt that the occasion\r\nought to be seized for further entrenching the existing institution,\r\nstrong as it seemed in fact, by more systematic defences in principle\r\nand theory. He sat down to the literary task with uncommon vigour and\r\npersistency. His object was not merely to show that the state has a\r\nconscience, for not even the newest of new Machiavellians denies that a\r\nstate is bound by some moral obligations, though in history and fact it\r\nis true that\r\n\r\n                    Earth is sick,\r\n  And Heaven is weary, of the hollow words\r\n  Which States and Kingdoms utter when they talk\r\n  Of truth and justice.[100]\r\n\r\nBut the obligation of conscience upon a state was not Mr. Gladstone's\r\nonly point. His propositions were, that the state is cognisant of the\r\ndifference between religious truth and religious error: that the\r\npropagation of this truth and the discouragement of this error are among\r\nthe ends for which government exists; that the English state did\r\nrecognise as a fundamental duty to give an active and exclusive support\r\nto a certain religion; and finally that the condition of things\r\nresulting from the discharge of this duty was well worth preserving\r\nagainst encroachment, from whatever quarter encroachment might threaten.\r\n\r\n                       COMPOSITION OF HIS WORK\r\n\r\nOn July 23rd, the draft of his book was at last finished, and he\r\ndispatched it to James Hope for free criticism, suggestions, and\r\nrevision. The 'physical state of the MS.,' as Mr. Gladstone calls it,\r\nseems to have been rather indefensible, and his excuse for writing\r\n'irregularly and confusedly, considering the pressure of other\r\nengagements'--an excuse somewhat too common with him--was not quite so\r\nvalid as he seems to have thought it. 'The defects,' writes Hope, 'are\r\nsuch as must almost necessarily occur when a great subject is handled\r\npiecemeal and at intervals; and I should recommend, with a view to\r\nremedying them, that you procure the whole to be copied out in a good\r\nlegible hand with blank pages, and that you read it through in this\r\nshape once connectedly, with a view to the whole argument, and again\r\nwith a view to examining the structure of each part.'[101] Hope took as\r\nmuch trouble with the argument and structure of the book as if he were\r\nhimself its author. For many weeks the fervid toil went on.\r\n\r\nThe strain on his eyesight that had embarrassed Mr. Gladstone for\r\nseveral months now made abstinence from incessant reading and writing\r\nnecessary, and he was ordered to travel. He first settled with his\r\nsister at Ems (August 15th), whither the proofs of his book with Hope's\r\nannotations followed, nor did he finally get rid of the burden until the\r\nmiddle of September. The tedium of life in hotels was almost worse than\r\nthe tedium of revising proofs, and at Milan and Florence he was strongly\r\ntempted to return home, as the benefit was problematical; it was even\r\ndoubtful whether pictures were any less trying to his eyes than books.\r\nHe made the acquaintance of one celebrated writer of the time. 'I went\r\nto see Manzoni,' he says, 'in his house some six or eight miles from\r\nMilan in 1838. He was a most interesting man, but was regarded, as I\r\nfound, among the more fashionable priests in Milan as a _bacchettone_\r\n[hypocrite]. In his own way he was, I think, a liberal and a\r\nnationalist, nor was the alliance of such politics with strong religious\r\nconvictions uncommon among the more eminent Italians of those days.'\r\n\r\nOctober found him in Sicily,[102] where he travelled with Sir Stephen\r\nGlynne and his two sisters, and here we shall soon see that with one of\r\nthese sisters a momentous thing came to pass. It was at Catania that he\r\nfirst heard of the publication of his book. A month or more was passed\r\nin Rome in company with Manning, and together they visited Wiseman,\r\nManning's conversion still thirteen years off. Macaulay too, now\r\neight-and-thirty, was at Rome that winter. 'On Christmas Eve,' he says,\r\n'I found Gladstone in the throng, and I accosted him, as we had met,\r\nthough we had never been introduced to each other. We talked and walked\r\ntogether in St. Peter's during the best part of an afternoon. He is both\r\na clever and an amiable man....' At Rome, as the state of his eyesight\r\nforbade too close resort to picture galleries and museums, he listened\r\nto countless sermons, all carefully recorded in his diary. Dr. Wiseman\r\ngave him a lesson in the missal. On his birthday he went with Manning to\r\nhear mass with the pope's choir, and they were placed on the bench\r\nbehind the cardinals. At St. Peter's he recalled that there his first\r\nconception of the unity of the church had come into his mind, and the\r\ndesire for its attainment--'an object in every human sense hopeless, but\r\nnot therefore the less to be desired, for the horizon of human hope is\r\nnot that of divine power and wisdom. That idea has been upon the whole,\r\nI believe, the ruling one of my life during the period that has since\r\nelapsed.' On January 19, he bade 'a reluctant adieu to the mysterious\r\ncity, whither he should repair who wishes to renew for a time the dream\r\nof life.'\r\n\r\nA few years later Mr. Gladstone noted some differences between English\r\nand Italian preaching that are of interest:--\r\n\r\n     The fundamental distinction between English and Italian preaching\r\n     is, I think, this: the mind of the English preacher, or reader of\r\n     sermons, however impressive, is fixed mainly upon his composition,\r\n     that of the Italian on his hearers. The Italian is a man applying\r\n     himself by his rational and persuasive organs to men, in order to\r\n     move them; the former is a man applying himself, with his best\r\n     ability in many cases, to a fixed form of matter, in order to _make\r\n     it_ move those whom he addresses. The action in the one case is\r\n     warm, living, direct, immediate, from heart to heart; in the other\r\n     it is transfused through a medium comparatively torpid. The first\r\n     is surely far superior to the second in truth and reality. The\r\n     preacher bears an awful message. Such messengers, if sent with\r\n     authority, are too much identified with, and possessed by, that\r\n     which they carry, to view it objectively during its delivery, it\r\n     absorbs their very being and all its energies, they _are_ their\r\n     message, and they see nothing extrinsic to themselves except those\r\n     to whose hearts they desire to bring it. In truth, what we want is\r\n     the following of nature, and her genial development. (March 20,\r\n     Palm Sunday, '42.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     II\r\n\r\n                        GOES ABROAD. BOOK PUBLISHED\r\n\r\nIt was the end of January (1839) before Mr. Gladstone arrived in London,\r\nand by that time his work had been out for six or seven weeks.[103] On\r\nhis return we may be sure that his book and its fortunes were the young\r\nauthor's most lively interest. Church authorities and the clergy\r\ngenerally, so far as he could learn, approved, many of them very warmly.\r\nThe Bishop of London wrote this, and the Archbishop of Canterbury said\r\nit. It is easy to understand with what interest and delight the average\r\nchurchman would welcome so serious a contribution to the good cause, so\r\nbold an effort by so skilled a hand, by lessons from history, by general\r\nprinciples of national probity and a national religion, and by\r\nwell-digested materials gathered, as Hooker gathered his, 'from the\r\ncharacteristic circumstances of the time,' to support the case for\r\necclesiastical privilege. Anglicans of the better sort had their\r\nintellectual self-respect restored in Mr. Gladstone's book, by finding\r\nthat they need no longer subsist on the dregs of Eldonian prejudice, but\r\ncould sustain themselves in intellectual dignity and affluence by large\r\nthoughts and sonorous phrases upon the nature of human society as a\r\ngrand whole.[104] Even unconvinced whigs who quarrelled with the\r\narguments, admitted that the tories had found in the young member for\r\nNewark a well-read scholar, with extraordinary amplitude of mind, a man\r\nwho knew what reasoning meant, and a man who knew how to write.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter dealing with establishment drew forth premature\r\npraise from many who condemned the succeeding chapters setting out high\r\nnotions as to the church. From both universities he had favourable\r\naccounts. 'From Scotland they are mixed; those which are most definite\r\ntend to show there is considerable soreness, at which, God knows, I am\r\nnot surprised; but I have not sought nor desired it.' The Germans on the\r\nwhole approved. Bunsen was exuberant; there was nobody, he said, with\r\nwhom he so loved [Greek: symphilosophein kai symphilologein]; people have too\r\nmuch to do about themselves to have time to seek truth on its own\r\naccount; the greater, therefore, the merit of the writer who forces his\r\nage to decide, whether they will serve God or Baal. Gladstone is the\r\nfirst man in England as to intellectual power, he cried, and he has\r\nheard higher tones than any one else in this land. The Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia sent him civil messages, and meant to have the book translated.\r\nRogers, the poet, wrote that his mother was descended from stout\r\nnonconformists, that his father was perverted to his mother's heresies,\r\nand that therefore he himself could not be zealous in the cause; but,\r\nhowever that might be, of this Mr. Gladstone might be very sure, that he\r\nwould love and admire the author of the book as much as ever. The Duke\r\nof Newcastle expected much satisfaction; meanwhile declared it to be a\r\nnational duty to provide churches and pastors; parliament should vote\r\neven millions and millions; then dissent would uncommonly soon\r\ndisappear, and a blessing would fall upon the land. Dr. Arnold told his\r\nfriends how much he admired the spirit of the book throughout, how he\r\nliked the substance of half of it, how erroneous he thought the other\r\nhalf. Wordsworth pronounced it worthy of all attention, doubted whether\r\nthe author had not gone too far about apostolical descent; but then,\r\nlike the sage that he was, the poet admitted that he must know a great\r\ndeal more ecclesiastical history, be better read in the Fathers, and\r\nread the book itself over again, before he could feel any right to\r\ncriticise.[105]\r\n\r\n                            ITS RECEPTION\r\n\r\nHis political leaders had as yet not spoken a word. On February 9th, Mr.\r\nGladstone dined at Sir Robert Peel's. 'Not a word from him, Stanley, or\r\nGraham yet, even to acknowledge my poor book; but no change in manner,\r\ncertainly none in Peel or Graham.' Monckton Milnes had been to Drayton,\r\nand told how the great man there had asked impatiently why anybody with\r\nso fine a career before him should go out of his way to write books.\r\n'Sir Robert Peel,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'who was a religious man, was\r\nwholly anti-church and unclerical, and largely undogmatic. I feel that\r\nSir R. Peel must have been quite perplexed in his treatment of me after\r\nthe publication of the book, partly through his own fault, for by habit\r\nand education he was quite incapable of comprehending the movement in\r\nthe church, the strength it would reach, and the exigencies it would\r\nentail. Lord Derby, I think, early began to escape from the erastian\r\nyoke which weighed upon Peel. Lord Aberdeen was, I should say,\r\naltogether enlightened in regard to it and had cast it off: so that he\r\nobtained from some the sobriquet (during his ministry) of \"the\r\npresbyterian Puseyite.\"' Even Mr. Gladstone's best friends trembled for\r\nthe effect of his ecclesiastical zeal upon his powers of political\r\nusefulness, and to the same effect was the general talk of the town. The\r\ncommon suspicion that the writer was doing the work of the hated\r\nPuseyites grew darker and spread further. Then in April came Macaulay's\r\narticle in the _Edinburgh_, setting out with his own incomparable\r\ndirectness, pungency, and effect, all the arguments on the side of that\r\npopular antagonism which was rooted far less in specific reasoning than\r\nin a general anti-sacerdotal instinct that lies deep in the hearts of\r\nEnglishmen. John Sterling called the famous article the assault of an\r\nequipped and practised sophist against a crude young platonist, who\r\nhappens by accident to have been taught the hard and broken dialect of\r\nAristotle rather than the deep, continuous, and musical flow of his true\r\nand ultimate master. Author and critic exchanged magnanimous letters\r\nworthy of two great and honourable men.[106] Not the least wonderful\r\nthing about Macaulay's review is that he should not have seen how many\r\nof his own most trenchant considerations told no more strongly against\r\nMr. Gladstone's theory, than they told against that whig theory of\r\nestablishment which at the end of his article he himself tried to set up\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\nPraise indeed came, and praise that no good man could have treated with\r\nindifference, from men like Keble, and it came from other quarters\r\nwhence it was perhaps not quite so welcome, and not much more dangerous.\r\nHe heard (March 19) that the Duke of Sussex, at Lord Durham's, had been\r\nstrongly condemning the book; and by an odd contrast just after, as he\r\nwas standing in conversation with George Sinclair, O'Connell with\r\nevident purpose came up and began to thank him for a most valuable work;\r\nfor the doctrine of the authority of the church and infallibility in\r\nessentials--a great approximation to the church of Rome--an excellent\r\nsign in one who if he lived, etc. etc. It did not go far enough for the\r\nRoman catholic Archbishop of Tuan; but Dr. Murray, the Archbishop of\r\nDublin, was delighted with it; he termed it an honest book, while as to\r\nthe charges against romanism Mr. Gladstone was misinformed. 'I merely\r\nsaid I was very glad to approximate to any one on the ground of _truth_;\r\n_i.e._ rejoiced when truth immediately wrought out, in whatever degree,\r\nits own legitimate result of unity. O'Connell said he claimed half of\r\nme.... Count Montalembert came to me to-day (March 23rd), and sat long,\r\nfor the purpose of ingenuously and kindly impugning certain statements\r\nin my book, viz. (1) That the peculiar tendency of the policy of\r\nromanism before the reformation went to limit in the mass of men\r\nintellectual exercise upon religion. (2) That the doctrine of purgatory\r\nadjourned until after death, more or less, the idea and practice of the\r\npractical work of religion. (3) That the Roman catholic church restricts\r\nthe reading of the scriptures by the Christian people. He spoke of the\r\nevils; I contended we had a balance of good, and that the idea of duty\r\nin individuals was more developed here than in pure Roman catholic\r\ncountries.'\r\n\r\n                          THE BOOK TOO LATE\r\n\r\nAll was of no avail. 'Scarcely had my work issued from the press,' wrote\r\nMr. Gladstone thirty years later, 'when I became aware that there was no\r\nparty, no section of a party, no individual person probably, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, who was prepared to act upon it. I found myself the\r\nlast man on a sinking ship.' Exclusive support to the established\r\nreligion of the country had been the rule; 'but when I bade it live, it\r\nwas just about to die. It was really a quickened, not a deadened\r\nconscience, in the country, that insisted on enlarging the circle of\r\nstate support.'[107] The result was not wholly unexpected, for in the\r\nsummer of 1838 while actually writing the book, he records that he 'told\r\nPusey for himself alone, I thought my own church and state principles\r\nwithin one stage of being hopeless as regards success in this\r\ngeneration.'\r\n\r\nAnother set of fragmentary notes, composed in 1894, and headed 'Some of\r\nmy Errors,' contains a further passage that points in a significant\r\ndirection:--\r\n\r\n     Oxford had not taught me, nor had any other place or person, the\r\n     value of liberty as an essential condition of excellence in human\r\n     things. True, Oxford had supplied me with the means of applying a\r\n     remedy to this mischief, for she had undoubtedly infused into my\r\n     mind the love of truth as a dominant and supreme motive of conduct.\r\n     But this it took long to develop into its proper place and\r\n     function. It may, perhaps, be thought that among these errors I\r\n     ought to record the publication in 1838 of my first work, _The\r\n     State in its Relation with the Church_. Undoubtedly that work was\r\n     written in total disregard or rather ignorance of the conditions\r\n     under which alone political action was possible in matters of\r\n     religion. It involved me personally in a good deal of\r\n     embarrassment.... In the sanguine fervour of youth, having now\r\n     learned something about the nature of the church and its office,\r\n     and noting the many symptoms of revival and reform within her\r\n     borders, I dreamed that she was capable of recovering lost ground,\r\n     and of bringing back the nation to unity in her communion. A\r\n     notable projection from the ivory gate,\r\n\r\n       'Sed falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes.'[108]\r\n\r\n     From these points of view the effort seems contemptible. But I\r\n     think that there is more to be said. The land was overspread with a\r\n     thick curtain of prejudice. The foundations of the historic church\r\n     of England, except in the minds of a few divines, were obscured.\r\n     The evangelical movement, with all its virtues and merits, had the\r\n     vice of individualising religion in degree perhaps unexampled, and\r\n     of rendering the language of holy scripture about Mount Sion and\r\n     the kingdom of heaven little better than a jargon.... To meet the\r\n     demands of the coming time, it was a matter of vital necessity to\r\n     cut a way through all this darkness to a clearer and more solid\r\n     position. Immense progress has been made in that direction during\r\n     my lifetime, and I am inclined to hope that my book imparted a\r\n     certain amount of stimulus to the public mind, and made some small\r\n     contribution to the needful process in its earliest stage.\r\n\r\nIn the early pages of this very book, Mr. Gladstone says, that the union\r\nof church and state is to the church of secondary though great\r\nimportance; _her_ foundations are on the holy hills and her condition\r\nwould be no pitiable one, should she once more occupy the position that\r\nshe held before the reign of Constantine.[109] Faint echo of the\r\nunforgotten lines in which Dante cries out to Constantine what woes his\r\nfatal dower to the papacy had brought down on religion and mankind.[110]\r\nIn these sentences lay a germ that events were speedily to draw towards\r\nmaturity, a foreshadowing of the supreme principle that neither Oxford\r\nnor any other place had yet taught him, 'the value of liberty as an\r\nessential condition of excellence in human things.'\r\n\r\n                      WRITES _CHURCH PRINCIPLES_\r\n\r\nThis revelation only turned his zeal for religion as the paramount issue\r\nof the time and of all times into another channel. Feeling the\r\noverwhelming strength of the tide that was running against his view of\r\nwhat he counted vital aspects of the church as a national institution,\r\nhe next flew to the new task of working out the doctrinal mysteries that\r\nthis institution embodied, and with Mr. Gladstone to work out a thing in\r\nhis own mind always meant to expound and to enforce for the minds of\r\nothers. His pen was to him at once as sword and as buckler; and while\r\nthe book on _Church and State_, though exciting lively interest, was\r\nevidently destined to make no converts in theory and to be pretty\r\npromptly cast aside in practice, he soon set about a second work on\r\n_Church Principles_. It is true that with the tenacious instinct of a\r\nborn controversialist, he still gave a good deal of time to constructing\r\nbuttresses for the weaker places that had been discovered by enemies or\r\nby himself in the earlier edifice, and in 1841 he published a revised\r\nversion of _Church and State_.[111] But ecclesiastical discussion was by\r\nthen taking a new shape, and the fourth edition fell flat. Of _Church\r\nPrinciples_, we may say that it was stillborn. Lockhart said of it, that\r\nthough a hazy writer, Gladstone showed himself a considerable divine,\r\nand it was a pity that he had entered parliament instead of taking\r\norders. The divinity, however, did not attract. The public are never\r\nvery willing to listen to a political layman discussing the arcana of\r\ntheology, and least of all were they inclined to listen to him about the\r\nnew-found arcana of anglo-catholic theology. As Macaulay said, this time\r\nit was a theological treatise, not an essay upon important questions of\r\ngovernment; and the intrepid reviewer rightly sought a more fitting\r\nsubject for his magician's gifts in the dramatists of the Restoration.\r\nNewman said of it, 'Gladstone's book is not open to the objections I\r\nfeared; it is doctrinaire, and (I think) somewhat self-confident; but it\r\nwill do good.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nA few sentences more will set before us the earliest of his transitions,\r\nand its gradual dates. He is writing about the first election at\r\nNewark:--\r\n\r\n     It was a curious piece of experience to a youth in his twenty-third\r\n     year, young of his age, who had seen little or nothing of the\r\n     world, who resigned himself to politics, but whose desire had been\r\n     for the ministry of God. The remains of this desire operated\r\n     unfortunately. They made me tend to glorify in an extravagant\r\n     manner and degree not only the religious character of the state,\r\n     which in reality stood low, but also the religious mission of the\r\n     conservative party. There was in my eyes a certain element of\r\n     Antichrist in the Reform Act, and that act was cordially hated,\r\n     though the leaders soon perceived that there would be no step\r\n     backward. It was only under the second government of Sir Robert\r\n     Peel that I learned how impotent and barren was the conservative\r\n     office for the church, though that government was formed of men\r\n     able, upright, and extremely well-disposed. It was well for me that\r\n     the unfolding destiny carried me off in a considerable degree from\r\n     political ecclesiasticism of which I should at that time have made\r\n     a sad mess. Providence directed that my mind should find its food\r\n     in other pastures than those in which my youthfulness would have\r\n     loved to seek it. I went beyond the general views of the tory party\r\n     in state churchism, ... it was my opinion that as to religions\r\n     other than those of the state, the state should tolerate only and\r\n     not pay. So I was against salaries for prison chaplains not of the\r\n     church, and I applied a logic plaster to all difficulties.... So\r\n     that Macaulay ... was justified in treating me as belonging to the\r\n     ultra section of the tories, had he limited himself to\r\n     ecclesiastical questions.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, when he received Manning's imprimatur for _Church Principles_,\r\nhe notes how hard the time and circumstances were in which he had to\r\nsteer his little bark. 'But the polestar is clear. Reflection shows me\r\nthat a political position is mainly valuable as instrumental for the\r\ngood of the church, and under this rule every question becomes one of\r\ndetail only.' By 1842 reflection had taken him a step further:--\r\n\r\n     I now approach the _mezzo del cammin_; my years glide away. It is\r\n     time to look forward to the close, and I do look forward. My life\r\n     ... has two prospective objects, for which I hope the performance\r\n     of my present public duties may, if not qualify, yet extrinsically\r\n     enable me. One, the adjustment of certain relations of the church\r\n     to the state. Not that I think the action of the latter can be\r\n     harmonised to the laws of the former. We have passed the point at\r\n     which that was possible.... But it would be much if the state would\r\n     honestly aim at enabling the church to develop her own intrinsic\r\n     means. To this I look. The second is, unfolding the catholic system\r\n     within her in some establishment or machinery looking both towards\r\n     the higher life, and towards the external warfare against ignorance\r\n     and depravity.\r\n\r\n                          INTERNAL CONFLICT\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1843, Mr. Gladstone explains to his father the relative\r\npositions of secular and church affairs in his mind, and this is only a\r\nfew months after what to most men is the absorbing moment of accession\r\nto cabinet and its responsibilities. 'I contemplate secular affairs,' he\r\nsays, 'chiefly as a means of being useful in church affairs, though I\r\nlikewise think it right and prudent not to meddle in church matters for\r\nany small reason. I am not making known anything new to you.... These\r\nwere the sentiments with which I entered public life, and although I do\r\nnot at all repent of [having entered it, and] am not disappointed in the\r\ncharacter of the employments it affords, certainly the experience of\r\nthem in no way and at no time has weakened my original impressions.' At\r\nthe end of 1843 he reached what looked like a final stage:--\r\n\r\n     Of public life, I certainly must say, every year shows me more and\r\n     more that the idea of Christian politics cannot be realised in the\r\n     state according to its present conditions of existence. For\r\n     purposes sufficient, I believe, but partial and finite, I am more\r\n     than content to be where I am. But the perfect freedom of the new\r\n     covenant can only, it seems to me, be breathed in other air; and\r\n     the day may come when God may grant to me the application of this\r\n     conviction to myself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] Hanna's _Life of Chalmers_, iv. pp. 37-46.\r\n\r\n[99] Ovid, _Met._ i. 5.--Chaos, before sea and land and all-covering\r\nskies.\r\n\r\n[100] _Excursion_, v.\r\n\r\n[101] _Memoirs of J.

In our case there is all the more reason to think of\r\nthis, because type hardly applies to a figure like Gladstone's, without\r\nany near or distant parallel, and composed of so many curious dualisms\r\nand unforeseen affinities. Truly was it said of Fenelon, that half of\r\nhim would be a great man, and would stand out more clearly as a great\r\nman than does the whole, because it would be simpler. So of Mr.\r\nGladstone. We are dazzled by the endless versatility of his mind and\r\ninterests as man of action, scholar, and controversial athlete; as\r\nlegislator, administrator, leader of the people; as the strongest of his\r\ntime in the main branches of executive force, strongest in persuasive\r\nforce; supreme in the exacting details of national finance; master of\r\nthe parliamentary arts; yet always living in the noble visions of the\r\nmoral and spiritual idealist. This opulence, vivacity, profusion, and\r\nthe promise of it all in these days of early prime, made an awakening\r\nimpression even on his foremost contemporaries. The impression might\r\nhave been easier to reproduce, if he had been less infinitely mobile. 'I\r\ncannot explain my own foundation,' Fenelon said; 'it escapes me; it\r\nseems to change every hour.' How are we to seek an answer to the same\r\nquestion in the history of Mr. Gladstone?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                            INTERNAL CONFLICT\r\n\r\nHis physical vitality--his faculties of free energy, endurance,\r\nelasticity--was a superb endowment to begin with. We may often ask for\r\nourselves and others: How many of a man's days does he really live?\r\nHowever men may judge the fruit it bore, Mr. Gladstone lived in vigorous\r\nactivity every day through all his years. Time showed that he was born\r\nwith a frame of steel. Though, unlike some men of heroic\r\nstrength--Napoleon for example--he often knew fatigue and weariness, yet\r\nhis organs never failed to answer the call of an intense and persistent\r\nWill. As we have already seen, in early manhood his eyes gave him much\r\ntrouble, and he both learned by heart and composed a good deal of verse\r\nby way of sparing them. He was a great walker, and at this time he was a\r\nsportsman, as his diary has shown. 'My object in shooting, ill as I do\r\nit, is the invigorating and cheering exercise, which does so much for\r\nhealth (1842).' One day this year (Sept. 13, '42) while out shooting,\r\nthe second barrel of a gun went off while he was reloading, shattering\r\nthe forefinger of his left hand. The remains of the finger the surgeons\r\nremoved. 'I have hardly ever in my life,' he says, 'had to endure\r\nserious bodily pain, and this was short.' In 1845, he notes, 'a hard\r\nday. What a mercy that my strength, in appearance not remarkable, so\r\nlittle fails me.' In the autumn of 1853 he was able to record, 'Eight or\r\nnine days of bed illness, the longest since I had the scarlet fever at\r\nnine or ten years old.' It was the same all through. His bodily strength\r\nwas in fact to prove extraordinary, and was no secondary element in the\r\nlong and strenuous course now opening before him.\r\n\r\nNot second to vigour of physical organisation--perhaps, if we only knew\r\nall the secrets of mind and matter, even connected with this vigour--was\r\nstrength and steadfastness of Will. Character, as has been often\r\nrepeated, is completely fashioned will, and this superlative\r\nrequirement, so indispensable for every man of action in whatever walk\r\nand on whatever scale, was eminently Mr. Gladstone's. From force of\r\nwill, with all its roots in habit, example, conviction, purpose, sprang\r\nhis leading and most effective qualities. He was never very ready to\r\ntalk about himself, but when asked what he regarded as his master\r\nsecret, he always said, '_Concentration_.' Slackness of mind, vacuity of\r\nmind, the wheels of the mind revolving without biting the rails of the\r\nsubject, were insupportable. Such habits were of the family of\r\nfaintheartedness, which he abhorred. Steady practice of instant, fixed,\r\neffectual attention, was the key alike to his rapidity of apprehension\r\nand to his powerful memory. In the orator's temperament exertion is\r\noften followed by a reaction that looks like indolence. This was never\r\nso with him. By instinct, by nature, by constitution, he was a man of\r\naction in all the highest senses of a phrase too narrowly applied and\r\ntoo narrowly construed. The currents of daimonic energy seemed never to\r\nstop, the vivid susceptibility to impressions never to grow dull. He was\r\nan idealist, yet always applying ideals to their purposes in act. Toil\r\nwas his native element; and though he found himself possessed of many\r\ninborn gifts, he was never visited by the dream so fatal to many a\r\nwell-laden argosy, that genius alone does all. There was nobody like him\r\nwhen it came to difficult business, for bending his whole strength to\r\nit, like a mighty archer stringing a stiff bow.\r\n\r\n                     FORCE OF WILL AND POWER OR TOIL\r\n\r\nSir James Graham said of him in these years that Gladstone could do in\r\nfour hours what it took any other man sixteen to do, and he worked\r\nsixteen hours a day. When I came to know him long years after, he told\r\nme that he thought when in office in the times that our story is now\r\napproaching, fourteen hours were a common tale. Nor was it mere mechanic\r\nindustry; it was hard labour, exact, strenuous, engrossing rigorous. No\r\nHohenzollern soldier held with sterner regularity to the duties of his\r\npost. Needless to add that he had a fierce regard for the sanctity of\r\ntime, although in the calling of the politician it is harder than in any\r\nother to be quite sure when time is well spent, and when wasted. His\r\nsupreme economy here, like many other virtues, carried its own defect,\r\nand coupled with his constitutional eagerness and his quick\r\nsusceptibility, it led at all periods of his life to some hurry. The\r\ntumult of business, he says one year in his diary, 'follows and whirls\r\nme day and night.' He speaks once in 1844 of 'a day restless as the\r\nsea.' There were many such. That does not mean, and has nothing to do\r\nwith, 'proud precipitance of soul,' nor haste in forming pregnant\r\nresolves. Here he was deliberate enough, and in the ordinary conduct of\r\nlife even minor things were objects of scrutiny and calculation, far\r\nbeyond the habit of most men. For he was lowlander as well as\r\nhighlander. But a vast percentage of his letters from boyhood onwards\r\ncontain apologies for haste. More than once when his course was nearly\r\nrun, he spoke of his life having been passed in 'unintermittent hurry,'\r\njust as Mill said, he had never been in a hurry in his life until he\r\nentered parliament, and then he had never been out of a hurry.\r\n\r\nIt was no contradiction that deep and constant in him, along with this\r\nvehement turn for action, was a craving for tranquil collection of\r\nhimself that seemed almost monastic. To Mrs. Gladstone he wrote a couple\r\nof years after their marriage (Dec. 13, 1841):--\r\n\r\n     You interpret so indulgently what I mean about the necessity of\r\n     quiescence at home during the parliamentary session, that I need\r\n     not say much; and yet I think my doctrine must _seem_ so strange\r\n     that I wish again and again to state how entirely it is different\r\n     from anything like disparagement, of George for example. It is\r\n     always relief and always delight to see and to be with you; and you\r\n     would, I am sure, be glad to know, how near Mary [Lady Lyttelton]\r\n     comes as compared with others to you, as respects what I can hardly\r\n     describe in few words, my mental rest, when she is present. But\r\n     there is no _man_ however near to me, with whom I am fit to be\r\n     habitually, when hard worked. I have told you how reluctant I have\r\n     always found myself to detail to my father on coming home, when I\r\n     lived with him, what had been going on in the House of Commons.\r\n     Setting a tired mind to work is like making a man run up and down\r\n     stairs when his limbs are weary.\r\n\r\nIf he sometimes recalls a fiery hero of the _Iliad_, at other times he\r\nis the grave and studious benedictine, but whether in quietude or\r\nmovement, always a man with a purpose and never the loiterer or lounger,\r\nnever apathetic, never a sufferer from that worst malady of the human\r\nsoul--from cheerlessness and cold.\r\n\r\nWe need not take him through a phrenological table of elements, powers,\r\nfaculties, leanings, and propensities. Very early, as we shall soon see,\r\nMr. Gladstone gave marked evidence of that sovereign quality of Courage\r\nwhich became one of the most signal of all his traits. He used to say\r\nthat he had known three men in his time possessing in a supreme degree\r\nthe virtue of parliamentary courage--Peel, Lord John Russell, and\r\nDisraeli. To some other contemporaries for whom courage might be\r\nclaimed, he stoutly denied it. Nobody ever dreamed of denying it to him,\r\nwhether parliamentary courage or any other, in either its active or its\r\npassive shape, either in daring or in fortitude. He had even the courage\r\nto be prudent, just as he knew when it was prudent to be bold. He\r\napplied in public things the Spenserian line, '_Be bold, be bold, and\r\neverywhere be bold_,' but neither did he forget the iron door with its\r\nadmonition, '_Be not too bold_.' The great Conde, when complimented on\r\nhis courage, always said that he took good care never to call upon it\r\nunless the occasion were absolutely necessary. No more did Mr. Gladstone\r\ngo out of his way to summon courage for its own sake, but only when\r\nspurred by duty; then he knew no faltering. Capable of much\r\ncircumspection, yet soon he became known for a man of lion heart.\r\n\r\n                       MEASURE OF HIS GIFTS\r\n\r\nNature had bestowed on him many towering gifts. Whether Humour was among\r\nthem, his friends were wont to dispute. That he had a gaiety and\r\nsympathetic alacrity of mind that was near of kin to humour, nobody who\r\nknew him would deny. Of playfulness his speeches give a thousand proofs;\r\nof drollery and fun he had a ready sense, though it was not always easy\r\nto be quite sure beforehand what sort of jest would hit or miss. For\r\nirony, save in its lighter forms as weapon in debate, he had no marked\r\ntaste or turn. But he delighted in good comedy, and he reproached me\r\nseverely for caring less than one ought to do for the _Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor_. Had he Imagination? In its high literary and poetic form he\r\nrose to few conspicuous flights--such, for example, as Burke's descent\r\nof Hyder Ali upon the Carnatic--in vast and fantastic conceptions such\r\nas arose from time to time in the brain of Napoleon, he had no part or\r\nlot. But in force of moral and political imagination, in bold, excursive\r\nrange, in the faculty of illuminating practical and objective\r\ncalculations with lofty ideals of the strength of states, the happiness\r\nof peoples, the whole structure of good government, he has had no\r\nsuperior among the rulers of England. His very ardour of temperament\r\ngave him imagination; he felt as if everybody who listened to him in a\r\ngreat audience was equally fired with his own energy of sympathy,\r\nindignation, conviction, and was transported by the same emotion that\r\nthrilled through himself. All this, however, did not fully manifest\r\nitself at this time, nor for some years to come.\r\n\r\nStrength of will found scope for exercise where some would not discover\r\nthe need for it. In native capacity for righteous Anger he abounded. The\r\nflame soon kindled, and it was no fire of straw; but it did not master\r\nhim. Mrs. Gladstone once said to me (1891), that whoever writes his life\r\nmust remember that he had two sides--one impetuous, impatient,\r\nirrestrainable, the other all self-control, able to dismiss all but the\r\ngreat central aim, able to put aside what is weakening or disturbing;\r\nthat he achieved this self-mastery, and had succeeded in the struggle\r\never since he was three or four and twenty, first by the natural power\r\nof his character, and second by incessant wrestling in prayer--prayer\r\nthat had been abundantly answered.\r\n\r\nProblems of compromise are of the essence of the parliamentary and\r\ncabinet system, and for some years at any rate he was more than a little\r\nrestive when they confronted him. Though in the time to come he had\r\nabundant difference with colleagues, he had all the virtues needed for\r\npolitical co-operation, as Cobden, Bright, and Mill had them, nor did he\r\never mistake for courage or independence the unhappy preference for\r\nhaving a party or an opinion exclusively to one's self. 'What is wanted\r\nabove all things,' he said, 'in the business of joint counsel, is the\r\nfaculty of making many one, of throwing the mind into the common\r\nstock.'[113] This was a favourite phrase with him for that power of\r\nworking with other people, without which a man would do well to stand\r\naside from public affairs. He used to say that of all the men he had\r\never known, Sir George Grey had most of this capacity for throwing his\r\nmind into joint stock. The demands of joint stock he never took to mean\r\nthe quenching of the duty in a man to have a mind of his own. He was\r\nalways amused by the recollection of somebody at Oxford--'a regius\r\nprofessor of divinity, I am sorry to say'--who was accustomed to define\r\ntaste as 'a faculty of coinciding with the opinion of the majority.'\r\n\r\nHard as he strove for a broad basis in general theory and high abstract\r\nprinciple, yet always aiming at practical ends he kept in sight the\r\nopportune. Nobody knew better the truth, so disastrously neglected by\r\npoliticians who otherwise would be the very salt of the earth, that not\r\nall questions are for all times. 'For my part,' Mr. Gladstone said, 'I\r\nhave not been so happy, at any time of my life, as to be able\r\nsufficiently to adjust the proper conditions of handling any difficult\r\nquestion, until the question itself was at the door.'[114] He could not\r\nreadily apply himself to topics outside of those with which he chanced\r\nat the moment to be engrossed:--'Can you not wait? Is it necessary to\r\nconsider now?' That was part of his concentration. Nor did he fly at a\r\npiece of business, deal with it, then let it fall from his grasp. It\r\nbecame part of him. If circumstances brought it again into his vicinity,\r\nthey found him instantly ready, with a prompt continuity that is no\r\nsmall element of power in public business.\r\n\r\nHow little elastic and self-confident at heart he was in some of his\r\nmoods in early manhood, we discern in the curious language of a letter\r\nto his brother-in-law Lyttelton in 1840:--\r\n\r\n     It is my nature to lean not so much on the applause as upon the\r\n     assent of others to a degree which perhaps I do not show, from that\r\n     sense of weakness and utter inadequacy to my work which never\r\n     ceases to attend me while I am engaged upon these subjects.... I\r\n     wish you knew the state of total impotence to which I should be\r\n     reduced if there were no echo to the accents of my own voice. I go\r\n     through my labour, such as it is, not by a genuine elasticity of\r\n     spirit, but by a plodding movement only just able to contend with\r\n     inert force, and in the midst of a life which indeed has little\r\n     claim to be called active, yet is broken this way and that into a\r\n     thousand small details, certainly unfavourable to calm and\r\n     continuity of thought.\r\n\r\nHere we have a glimpse of a singular vein peculiarly rare in ardent\r\ngenius at thirty, but disclosing its traces in Mr. Gladstone even in his\r\nripest years.\r\n\r\n                                AS ORATOR\r\n\r\nWas this the instinct of the orator? For it was in the noble arts of\r\noratory that nature had been most lavish, and in them he rose to be\r\nconsummate. The sympathy and assent of which he speaks are a part of\r\noratorical inspiration, and even if such sympathy be but superficial,\r\nthe highest efforts of oratorical genius take it for granted. 'The work\r\nof the orator,' he once wrote, 'from its very inception is inextricably\r\nmixed up with practice. It is cast in the mould offered to him by the\r\nmind of his hearers. It is an influence principally received from his\r\naudience (so to speak) in vapour, which he pours back upon them in a\r\nflood. The sympathy and concurrence of his time, is, with his own mind,\r\njoint parent of the work. He cannot follow nor frame ideals: his choice\r\nis, to be what his age will have him, what it requires in order to be\r\nmoved by him; or else not to be at all.'[115]\r\n\r\nAmong Mr. Gladstone's physical advantages for bearing the orator's\r\nsceptre were a voice of singular fulness, depth, and variety of tone; a\r\nfalcon's eye with strange imperious flash; features mobile, expressive,\r\nand with lively play; a great actor's command of gesture, bold,\r\nsweeping, natural, unforced, without exaggeration or a trace of\r\nmelodrama. His pose was easy, alert, erect. To these endowments of\r\nexternal mien was joined the gift and the glory of words. They were not\r\nsought, they came. Whether the task were reasoning or exposition or\r\nexpostulation, the copious springs never failed. Nature had thus done\r\nmuch for him, but he superadded ungrudging labour. Later in life he\r\nproffered to a correspondent a set of suggestions on the art of\r\nspeaking:--\r\n\r\n     1. Study plainness of language, always preferring the simpler word.\r\n     2. Shortness of sentences. 3. Distinctness of articulation. 4. Test\r\n     and question your own arguments beforehand, not waiting for critic\r\n     or opponent. 5. Seek a thorough digestion of, and familiarity with,\r\n     your subject, and rely mainly on these to prompt the proper words.\r\n     6. Remember that if you are to sway an audience you must besides\r\n     thinking out your matter, watch them all along.--(March 20, 1875.)\r\n\r\nThe first and second of these rules hardly fit his own style. Yet he had\r\nseriously studied from early days the devices of a speaker's training. I\r\nfind copied into a little note-book many of the precepts and maxims of\r\nQuintilian on the making of an orator. So too from Cicero's _De\r\nOratore_, including the words put into the mouth of Catulus, that nobody\r\ncan attain the glory of eloquence without the height of zeal and toil\r\nand knowledge.[116] Zeal and toil and knowledge, working with an inborn\r\nfaculty of powerful expression--here was the double clue. He never\r\nforgot the Ciceronian truth that the orator is not made by the tongue\r\nalone, as if it were a sword sharpened on a whetstone or hammered on an\r\nanvil; but by having a mind well filled with a free supply of high and\r\nvarious matter.[117] His eloquence was 'inextricably mixed up with\r\npractice.' An old whig listening to one of his budget speeches, said\r\nwith a touch of bitterness, 'Ah, Oxford on the surface, but Liverpool\r\nbelow.' No bad combination. He once had a lesson from Sir Robert Peel.\r\nMr. Gladstone, being about to reply in debate, turned to his chief and\r\nsaid: 'Shall I be short and concise?' 'No,' was the answer, 'be long and\r\ndiffuse. It is all important in the House of Commons to state your case\r\nin many different ways, so as to produce an effect on men of many ways\r\nof thinking.'\r\n\r\nIn discussing Macaulay, Sir Francis Baring, an able and unbiassed judge,\r\nadvised a junior (1860) about patterns for the parliamentary\r\naspirant:--'Gladstone is to my mind a much better model for speaking; I\r\nmean he is happier in joining great eloquence and selection of words and\r\nrhetoric, if you will, with a style not a bit above debate. It does not\r\nsmell of the oil. Of course there has been plenty of labour, and that\r\nnot of to-day but during a whole life.' Nothing could be truer.\r\nCertainly for more than the first forty years of his parliamentary\r\nexistence, he cultivated a style not above debate, though it was debate\r\nof incomparable force and brilliance. When simpletons say, as if this\r\nwere to dispose of every higher claim for him, that he worked all his\r\nwonders by his gifts as orator, do they ever think what power over such\r\nan assembly as the House of Commons signifies? Here--and it was not\r\nuntil he had been for thirty years and more in parliament that he betook\r\nhimself largely to the efforts of the platform--here he was addressing\r\nmen of the world, some of them the flower of English education and\r\nintellectual accomplishment; experts in all the high practical lines of\r\nlife, bankers, merchants, lawyers, captains of industry in every walk;\r\nmen trained in the wide experience and high responsibilities of public\r\noffice; lynx-eyed rivals and opponents. Is this the scene, or were these\r\nthe men, for the triumphs of the barren rhetorician and the sophist,\r\nwhose words have no true relation to the facts? Where could general\r\nmental strength be better tested? As a matter of history most of those\r\nwho have held the place of leading minister in the House of Commons have\r\nhardly been orators at all, any more than Washington and Jefferson were\r\norators. Mr. Gladstone conquered the house, because he was saturated\r\nwith a subject and its arguments; because he could state and enforce his\r\ncase; because he plainly believed every word he said, and earnestly\r\nwished to press the same belief into the minds of his hearers; finally\r\nbecause he was from the first an eager and a powerful athlete. The man\r\nwho listening to his adversary asks of his contention, 'Is this true?'\r\nis a lost debater; just as a soldier would be lost who on the day of\r\nbattle should bethink him that the enemy's cause might after all perhaps\r\nbe just. The debater does not ask, 'Is this true?' He asks, 'What is the\r\nanswer to this? How can I most surely floor him?' Lord Coleridge\r\ninquired of Mr. Gladstone whether he ever felt nervous in public\r\nspeaking: 'In opening a subject often,' Mr. Gladstone answered, 'in\r\nreply never.' Yet with this inborn readiness for combat, nobody was less\r\naddicted to aggression or provocation. It was with him a salutary maxim\r\nthat, if you have unpalatable opinions to declare, you should not make\r\nthem more unpalatable by the way of expressing them. In his earlier\r\nyears he did not often speak with passion. 'This morning,' a famous\r\ndivine once said, 'I preached a sermon all flames.' Mr. Gladstone\r\nsometimes made speeches of that cast, but not frequently, I think, until\r\nthe seventies. Meanwhile he impressed the House by his nobility, his\r\nsincerity, his simplicity; for there is plenty of evidence besides Mr.\r\nGladstone's case, that simplicity of character is no hindrance to\r\nsubtlety of intellect.\r\n\r\nContemporaries in these opening years describe his parliamentary manners\r\nas much in his favour. His countenance, they say, is mild and pleasant,\r\nand has a high intellectual expression. His eyes are clear and quick.\r\nHis eyebrows are dark and rather prominent. There is not a dandy in the\r\nHouse but envies his fine head of jet-black hair. Mr. Gladstone's\r\ngesture is varied, but not violent. When he rises, he generally puts\r\nboth his hands behind his back, and having there suffered them to\r\nembrace each other for a short time, he unclasps them, and allows them\r\nto drop on either side. They are not permitted to remain long in that\r\nlocality before you see them again closed together, and hanging down\r\nbefore him.[118] Other critics say that his air and voice are too\r\nabstract, and 'you catch the sound as though he were communing with\r\nhimself. It is as though you saw a bright picture through a filmy veil.\r\nHis countenance, without being strictly handsome, is highly\r\nintellectual. His pale complexion, slightly tinged with olive, and dark\r\nhair, cut rather close to his head, with an eye of remarkable depth,\r\nstill more impress you with the abstracted character of his disposition.\r\nThe expression of his face would be sombre were it not for the striking\r\neye, which has a remarkable fascination. His triumphs as a debater are\r\nachieved not by the aid of the passions, as with Sir James Graham, or\r\nwith Mr. Sheil; not of prejudice and fallacy, as with Robert Peel; not\r\nwith imagination and high seductive colouring, as with Mr. Macaulay:\r\nbut--of pure reason. He prevails by that subdued earnestness which\r\nresults from deep religious feelings, and is not fitted for the more\r\nusual and more stormy functions of a public speaker.'[119]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n                          ACTION HIS FIELD\r\n\r\nWe are not to think of him as prophet, seer, poet, founder of a system,\r\nor great born man of letters like Gibbon, Macaulay, Carlyle. Of these\r\ncharacters he was none, though he had warmth and height of genius to\r\ncomprehend the value of them all, and--what was more curious--his\r\noratory and his acts touched them and their work in such a way that men\r\nwere always tempted to apply to him standards that belonged to them. His\r\ncalling was a different one, and he was wont to appraise it lower. His\r\nfield lay 'in working the institutions of his country.' Whether he would\r\nhave played a part as splendid in the position of a high ruling\r\necclesiastic, if the times had allowed such a personage, we cannot tell;\r\nperhaps he had not 'imperious immobility' enough. Nor whether he would\r\nhave made a judge of the loftier order; perhaps his mind was too\r\naddicted to subtle distinctions, and not likely to give a solid\r\nadherence to broad principles of law. A superb advocate? An evangelist,\r\nas irresistible as Wesley or as Whitefield? What matters it? All agree\r\nthat more magnificent power of mind was never placed at the service of\r\nthe British Senate.\r\n\r\nHis letters to his father from 1832 onwards show all the interest of a\r\nkeen young member in his calling, though they contain few anecdotes, or\r\ntales, or vivid social traits. 'Of political gossip,' he admits to his\r\nfather (1843), 'you always find me barren enough.' What comes out in all\r\nhis letters to his kinsfolk is his unbounded willingness to take trouble\r\nin order to spare others. Even in prolonged and intricate money\r\ntransactions, of which we shall see something latertransactions of all\r\nothers the most apt to produce irritation--not an accent of impatience\r\nor dispute escapes him, though the guarded firmness of his language\r\nmarks the steadfast self-control. We may say of Mr. Gladstone that\r\nnobody ever had less to repent of from that worst waste in human life\r\nthat comes of unkindness. Kingsley noticed, with some wonder, how he\r\nnever allowed the magnitude and multiplicity of his labours to excuse\r\nhim from any of the minor charities and courtesies of life.\r\n\r\nActive hatred of cruelty, injustice, and oppression is perhaps the main\r\ndifference between a good man and a bad one; and here Mr. Gladstone was\r\nsublime. Yet though anger burned fiercely in him over wrong, nobody was\r\nmore chary of passing moral censures. What he said of himself in 1842,\r\nwhen he was three and thirty, held good to the end:--\r\n\r\n     Nothing grows upon me so much with lengthening life as the sense of\r\n     the difficulties, or rather the impossibilities, with which we are\r\n     beset whenever we attempt to take to ourselves the functions of the\r\n     Eternal Judge (except in reference to ourselves where judgment is\r\n     committed to us), and to form any accurate idea of relative merit\r\n     and demerit, good and evil, in actions. The shades of the rainbow\r\n     are not so nice, and the sands of the sea-shore are not such a\r\n     multitude, as are all the subtle, shifting, blending forms of\r\n     thought and of circumstances that go to determine the character of\r\n     us and of our acts. But there is One that seeth plainly and judgeth\r\n     righteously.\r\n\r\n                               HIS SILENCES\r\n\r\nThis was only one side of Mr. Gladstone's many silences. To talk of the\r\nsilences of the most copious and incessant speaker and writer of his\r\ntime may seem a paradox. Yet in this fluent orator, this untiring\r\npenman, this eager and most sociable talker at the dinner-table or on\r\nfriendly walks, was a singular faculty of self-containment and reserve.\r\nQuick to notice, as he was, and acutely observant of much that might\r\nhave been expected to escape him, he still kept as much locked up within\r\nas he so liberally gave out. Bulwer Lytton was at one time, as is well\r\nknown, addicted to the study of mediaeval magic, occult power, and the\r\nconjunctions of the heavenly bodies; and among other figures he one day\r\namused himself by casting the horoscope of Mr. Gladstone (1860). To him\r\nthe astrologer's son sent it. Like most of such things, the horoscope\r\nhas one or two ingenious hits and a dozen nonsensical misses. But one\r\ncurious sentence declares Mr. Gladstone to be '_at heart a solitary\r\nman_.' Here I have often thought that the stars knew what they were\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Gladstone ever became what is called a good judge of men it\r\nwould be hard to say. Such characters are not common even among\r\nparliamentary leaders. They do not always care to take the trouble. The\r\nname is too commonly reserved for those who think dubiously or downright\r\nill of their fellow-creatures. Those who are accustomed to make most of\r\nknowing men, do their best to convince us that men are hardly worth\r\nknowing. This was not Mr. Gladstone's way. Like Lord Aberdeen, he had a\r\nmarked habit of believing people; it was part of his simplicity. His\r\nlife was a curious union of ceaseless contention and inviolable\r\ncharity--a true charity, having nothing in common with a lazy spirit of\r\nunconcern. He knew men well enough, at least, to have found out that\r\nnone gains such ascendency over them as he who appeals to what is the\r\nnobler part in human nature. Nestors of the whigs used to wonder how so\r\nmuch imagination, invention, courage, knowledge, diligence--all the\r\nqualities that seem to make an orator and a statesman--could be\r\nneutralised by the want of a sound overruling judgment. They said that\r\nGladstone's faculties were like an army without a general, or a jury\r\nwithout guidance from the bench.[120] Yet when the time came, this army\r\nwithout a general won the crowning victories of the epoch, and for\r\ntwenty years the chief findings of this jury without a judge proved to\r\nbe the verdicts of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for those less extraordinarily constituted, to realise\r\nthe vigour of soul that maintained an inner life in all its absorbing\r\nexaltation day after day, year after year, decade after decade, amid the\r\never-swelling rush of urgent secular affairs. Immersed in active\r\nresponsibility for momentous secular things, he never lost the breath\r\nof what was to him a diviner aether. Habitually he strove for the lofty\r\nuplands where political and moral ideas meet. Even in those days he\r\nstruck all who came into contact with him by a goodness and elevation\r\nthat matched the activity and power of his mind. His political career\r\nmight seem doubtful, but there was no doubt about the man. One of the\r\nmost interesting of his notes about his own growth is this:--\r\n\r\n     There was a singular slowness in the development of my mind, so far\r\n     as regarded its opening into the ordinary aptitudes of the man of\r\n     the world. For years and years well into advanced middle life, I\r\n     seem to have considered actions simply as they were in themselves,\r\n     and did not take into account the way in which they would be taken\r\n     and understood by others. I did not perceive that their natural or\r\n     probable effect upon minds other than my own formed part of the\r\n     considerations determining the propriety of each act in itself, and\r\n     not unfrequently, at any rate in public life, supplied the decisive\r\n     criterion to determine what ought and what ought not to be done. In\r\n     truth the dominant tendencies of my mind were those of a recluse,\r\n     and I might, in most respects with ease, have accommodated myself\r\n     to the education of the cloister. All the mental apparatus\r\n     requisite to constitute the 'public man' had to be purchased by a\r\n     slow experience and inserted piecemeal into the composition of my\r\n     character.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury describes himself in 1844 as curious to see Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'for he is a man much spoken of as one who will come to the\r\nfront.' He was greatly disappointed at his personal appearance, 'which\r\nis that of a Roman catholic ecclesiastic, but he is very\r\nagreeable.'[121] Few men can have been more perplexed, and few perhaps\r\nmore perplexing, as the social drama of the capital was in time unfolded\r\nto his gaze. There he beheld the glitter of rank and station, and\r\npalaces, and men and women bearing famous names; worlds within worlds,\r\nhigh diplomatic figures, the partisan leaders, the constant stream of\r\nagitated rumours about weighty affairs in England and Europe; the keen\r\nplay of ambition, passions, interests, under easy manners and fugitive\r\npleasantry; gross and sordid aims, as King Hudson was soon to find out,\r\nmasked by exterior refinement; so much kindness with a free spice of\r\ncriticism and touches of ill-nature; so much of the governing force of\r\nEngland still gathered into a few great houses, exclusive and full of\r\npride, and yet, after the astounding discovery that in spite of the\r\ndeluge of the Reform bill they were still alive as the directing class,\r\nalways so open to political genius if likely to climb, and help them to\r\nclimb, into political power. These were the last high days of the\r\nundisputed sway of territorial aristocracy in England. The artificial\r\nscene was gay and captivating; but much in it was well fitted to make\r\nserious people wonder. Queen Victoria was assuredly not of the harsh\r\nfibre of the misanthropist in Moliere's fine comedy; yet she once said a\r\nstrange and deep thing to an archbishop. 'As I get older,' she said, 'I\r\ncannot understand the world. I cannot comprehend its littlenesses. When\r\nI look at the frivolities and littlenesses, _it seems to me as if they\r\nwere all a little mad_.'[122]\r\n\r\n                           THE SOCIAL DRAMA\r\n\r\nThis was the stage on which Mr. Gladstone, with 'the dominant tendencies\r\nof a recluse' and a mind that might easily have been 'accommodated to\r\nthe cloister,' came to play his part,--in which he was 'by a slow\r\nexperience' to insert piecemeal the mental apparatus proper to the\r\ncharacter of the public man. Yet it was not among the booths and\r\nmerchandise and hubbub of Vanity Fair, it was among strata in the\r\ncommunity but little recognised as yet, that he was to find the field\r\nand the sources of his highest power. His view of the secular world was\r\nnever fastidious or unmanly. Looking back upon his long experience of it\r\nhe wrote (1894):--\r\n\r\n     That political life considered as a profession has great dangers\r\n     for the inner and true life of the human being, is too obvious. It\r\n     has, however, some redeeming qualities. In the first place, I have\r\n     never known, and can hardly conceive, a finer school of temper than\r\n     the House of Commons. A lapse in this respect is on the instant an\r\n     offence, a jar, a wound, to every member of the assembly; and it\r\n     brings its own punishment on the instant, like the sins of the Jews\r\n     under the old dispensation. Again, I think the imperious nature of\r\n     the subjects, their weight and force, demanding the entire strength\r\n     of a man and all his faculties, leave him no residue, at least for\r\n     the time, to apply to self-regard; no more than there is for a\r\n     swimmer swimming for his life. He must, too, in retrospect feel\r\n     himself to be so very small in comparison with the themes and the\r\n     interests of which he has to treat. It is a further advantage if\r\n     his occupation be not mere debate, but debate ending in work. For\r\n     in this way, whether the work be legislative or administrative, it\r\n     is continually tested by results, and he is enabled to strip away\r\n     his extravagant anticipations, his fallacious conceptions, to\r\n     perceive his mistakes, and to reduce his estimates to the reality.\r\n     No politician has any excuse for being vain.\r\n\r\nLike the stoic emperor, Mr. Gladstone had in his heart the feeling that\r\nthe man is a runaway who deserts the exercise of civil reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                         RELIGION THE MAINSPRING\r\n\r\nAll his activities were in his own mind one. This, we can hardly repeat\r\ntoo often, is the fundamental fact of Mr. Gladstone's history. Political\r\nlife was only part of his religious life. It was religion that prompted\r\nhis literary life. It was religious motive that, through a thousand\r\navenues and channels stirred him and guided him in his whole conception\r\nof active social duty, including one pitiful field of which I may say\r\nsomething later. The liberalism of the continent at this epoch was in\r\nits essence either hostile to Christianity or else it was indifferent;\r\nand when men like Lamennais tried to play at the same time the double\r\npart of tribune of the people and catholic theocrat, they failed. The\r\nold world of pope and priest and socialist and red cap of liberty fought\r\non as before. In England, too, the most that can be said of the leading\r\nbreed of the political reformers of that half century, with one or two\r\nmost notable exceptions, is that they were theists, and not all of them\r\nwere even so much as theists.[123] If liberalism had continued to run in\r\nthe grooves cut by Bentham, James Mill, Grote, and the rest, Mr.\r\nGladstone would never have grown to be a liberal. He was not only a\r\nfervid practising Christian; he was a Christian steeped in the fourth\r\ncentury, steeped in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Every man\r\nof us has all the centuries in him, though their operations be latent,\r\ndim, and very various; in his case the roots were as unmistakeable as\r\nthe leafage, the blossom, and the fruits. A little later than the date\r\nwith which we are now dealing (May 9, 1854)--and here the date matters\r\nlittle, for the case was always the same--he noted what in hours of\r\nstrain and crisis the Bible was to him:--\r\n\r\n     On most occasions of very sharp pressure or trial, some word of\r\n     scripture has come home to me as if borne on angels' wings. Many\r\n     could I recollect. The Psalms are the great storehouse. Perhaps I\r\n     should put some down now, for the continuance of memory is not to\r\n     be trusted. 1. In the winter of 1837, Psalm 128. This came in a\r\n     most singular manner, but it would be a long story to tell. 2. In\r\n     the Oxford contest of 1847 (which was very harrowing) the verse--'O\r\n     Lord God, Thou strength of my health, Thou hast covered my head in\r\n     the day of battle.' 3. In the Gorham contest, after the judgment:\r\n     'And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget Thee;\r\n     nor behave ourselves frowardly in Thy covenant. Our heart is not\r\n     turned back; neither our steps gone out of Thy way. No not when\r\n     Thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with\r\n     the shadow of death.' 4. On Monday, April 17, 1853 [his first\r\n     budget speech], it was: 'O turn Thee then unto me, and have mercy\r\n     upon me: give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and help the son of\r\n     Thine handmaid.' Last Sunday [Crimean war budget] it was not from\r\n     the Psalms for the day: 'Thou shalt prepare a table before me\r\n     against them that trouble me; Thou hast anointed my head with oil\r\n     and my cup shall be full.'\r\n\r\nIn that stage at least he had shaken off none of the grip of tradition,\r\nin which his book and college training had placed him. His mind still\r\nhad greater faith in things because Aristotle or Augustine said them,\r\nthan because they are true.[124] If the end of education be to teach\r\nindependence of mind, the Socratic temper, the love of pushing into\r\nunexplored areas--intellectual curiosity in a word--Oxford had done\r\nnone of all this for him. In every field of thought and life he started\r\nfrom the principle of authority; it fitted in with his reverential\r\ninstincts, his temperament, above all, his education.\r\n\r\n                     PLACE OF DANTE IN HIS MIND\r\n\r\nThe lifelong enthusiasm for Dante should on no account in this place be\r\nleft out. In Mr. Gladstone it was something very different from casual\r\ndilettantism or the accident of a scholar's taste. He was always alive\r\nto the grandeur of Goethe's words, _Im Ganzen, Guten, Wahren, resolut zu\r\nleben_, 'In wholeness, goodness, truth, strenuously to live.' But it was\r\nin Dante--active politician and thinker as well as poet--that he found\r\nthis unity of thought and coherence of life, not only illuminated by a\r\nsublime imagination, but directly associated with theology, philosophy,\r\npolitics, history, sentiment, duty. Here are all the elements and\r\ninterests that lie about the roots of the life of a man, and of the\r\ngeneral civilisation of the world. This ever memorable picture of the\r\nmind and heart of Europe in the great centuries of the catholic\r\nage,--making heaven the home of the human soul, presenting the natural\r\npurposes of mankind in their universality of good and evil, exalted and\r\nmean, piteous and hateful, tragedy and farce, all commingled as a living\r\nwhole,--was exactly fitted to the quality of a genius so rich and\r\npowerful as Mr. Gladstone's in the range of its spiritual intuitions and\r\nin its masculine grasp of all the complex truths of mortal nature. So\r\ntrue and real a book is it, he once said,--such a record of practical\r\nhumanity and of the discipline of the soul amidst its wonderful poetical\r\nintensity and imaginative power. In him this meant no spurious\r\nrevivalism, no flimsy and fantastic affectation. It was the real and\r\nenergetic discovery in the vivid conception and commanding structure of\r\nDante, of a light, a refuge, and an inspiration in the labours of the\r\nactual world. 'You have been good enough,' he once wrote to an Italian\r\ncorrespondent (1883), 'to call that supreme poet \"a solemn master\" for\r\nme. These are not empty words. The reading of Dante is not merely a\r\npleasure, a _tour de force_, or a lesson; it is a vigorous discipline\r\nfor the heart, the intellect, the whole man. In the school of Dante I\r\nhave learned a great part of that mental provision (however\r\ninsignificant it may be) which has served me to make the journey of\r\nhuman life up to the term of nearly seventy-three years.' He once asked\r\nof an accomplished woman possessing a scholar's breadth of reading, what\r\npoetry she most lived with. She named Dante for one. 'But what of\r\nDante?' 'The Paradiso,' she replied. 'Ah, that is right,' he exclaimed,\r\n'that's my test.' In the Paradiso it was, that he saw in beams of\r\ncrystal radiance the ideal of the unity of the religious mind, the love\r\nand admiration for the high unseen things of which the Christian church\r\nwas to him the sovereign embodiment. The mediaeval spirit, it is true,\r\nwears something of a ghostly air in the light of our new day. This\r\nattempt, which has been made many a time before, 'to unify two ages,'\r\ndid not carry men far in the second half of the nineteenth century.\r\nNevertheless it were an idle dream to think that the dead hand of\r\nDante's century, and all that it represented, is no longer to be taken\r\ninto account by those who would be governors of men. Meanwhile, let us\r\nobserve once more that the statesman who had drunk most deeply from the\r\nmediaeval fountains was yet one of the supreme leaders of his own\r\ngeneration in a notable stage of the long transition from mediaeval to\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\n'At Oxford,' he records, 'I read Rousseau's _Social Contract_ which had\r\nno influence upon me, and the writings of Burke which had a great deal.'\r\nYet the day came when he too was drawn by the movement of things into\r\nthe flaming circle of thought, feeling, phrase, that in romance and\r\npolitics and all the ways of life Europe for a century associated with\r\nthe name of Rousseau. There was what men call Rousseau in a statesman\r\nwho could talk of men's common 'flesh and blood' in connection with a\r\nfranchise bill. Indeed one of the strangest things in Mr. Gladstone's\r\ngrowth and career is this unconscious raising of a partially Rousseauite\r\nstructure on the foundations laid by Burke, to whom Rousseau was of all\r\nwriters on the nature of man and the ordering of states the most odious\r\nand contemptible. We call it strange, though such amalgams of contrary\r\nways of thinking and feeling are more common than careless observers may\r\nsuppose. Mr. Gladstone was never an 'equalitarian,' but the passion for\r\nsimplicity he had--simplicity in life, manners, feeling, conduct, the\r\nrelations of men to men; dislike of luxury and profusion and all the\r\nfabric of artificial and factitious needs. It may well be that he went\r\nno further for all this than the Sermon on the Mount, where so many\r\nsecret elements of social volcano slumber. However we may choose to\r\ntrace the sources and relations of Mr. Gladstone's general ideas upon\r\nthe political problems of his time, what he said of himself in the\r\nevening of his day was at least true of its dawn and noon. 'I am for old\r\ncustoms and traditions,' he wrote, 'against needless change. I am for\r\nthe individual as against the state. I am for the family and the stable\r\nfamily as against the state.' He must have been in eager sympathy with\r\nWordsworth's line taken from old Spenser in these very days, 'Perilous\r\nis sweeping change, all chance unsound.'[125] Finally and above all, he\r\nstood firm in 'the old Christian faith.' Life was to him in all its\r\naspects an application of Christian teaching and example. If we like to\r\nput it so, he was steadfast for making politics more human, and no\r\nbranch of civilised life needs humanising more.\r\n\r\nHere we touch the question of questions. At nearly every page of Mr.\r\nGladstone's active career the vital problem stares us in the face, of\r\nthe correspondence between the rule of private morals and of public. Is\r\nthe rule one and the same for individual and for state? From these early\r\nyears onwards, Mr. Gladstone's whole language and the moods that it\r\nreproduces,--his vivid denunciations, his sanguine expectations, his\r\nrolling epithets, his aspects and appeals and points of view,--all take\r\nfor granted that right and wrong depend on the same set of maxims in\r\npublic life and private. The puzzle will often greet us, and here it is\r\nenough to glance at it. In every statesman's case it arises; in Mr.\r\nGladstone's it is cardinal and fundamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\n                         MAXIMS OF ORDERED LIFE\r\n\r\nTo say that he had drawn prizes in what is called the lottery of life\r\nwould not be untrue; but just as true is it that one of those very\r\nprizes was the determined conviction that life is no lottery at all, but\r\na serious business worth taking infinite pains upon. To one of his sons\r\nat Oxford he wrote a little paper of suggestions that are the actual\r\ndescription of his own lifelong habit and unbroken practice.\r\n\r\n     _Strathconan, Oct. 7, 1872._--1. To keep a short journal of\r\n     principal employments in each day: most valuable as an account-book\r\n     of the all-precious gift of Time.\r\n\r\n     2. To keep also an account-book of receipt and expenditure; and the\r\n     least troublesome way of keeping it is to keep it with care. This\r\n     done in early life, and carefully done, creates the habit of\r\n     performing the great duty of keeping our expenditure (and therefore\r\n     our desires) within our means.\r\n\r\n     3. Read attentively (and it is pleasant reading) Taylor's essay on\r\n     Money,[126] which if I have not done it already, I will give you.\r\n     It is most healthy and most useful reading.\r\n\r\n     4. Establish a minimum number of hours in the day for study, say\r\n     seven at present, and do not without reasonable cause let it be\r\n     less; noting down against yourself the days of exception. There\r\n     should also be a minimum number for the vacations, which at Oxford\r\n     are extremely long.\r\n\r\n     5. There arises an important question about Sundays. Though we\r\n     should to the best of our power avoid secular work on Sundays, it\r\n     does not follow that the mind should remain idle. There is an\r\n     immense field of knowledge connected with religion, and much of it\r\n     is of a kind that will be of use in the schools and in relation to\r\n     your general studies. In these days of shallow scepticism, so\r\n     widely spread, it is more than ever to be desired that we should be\r\n     able to give a reason for the hope that is in us.\r\n\r\n     6. As to duties directly religious, such as daily prayer in the\r\n     morning and evening, and daily reading of some portion of the Holy\r\n     Scripture, or as to the holy ordinances of the gospel, there is\r\n     little need, I am confident, to advise you; one thing, however, I\r\n     would say, that it is not difficult, and it is most beneficial, to\r\n     cultivate the habit of inwardly turning the thoughts to God, though\r\n     but for a moment in the course or during the intervals of our\r\n     business; which continually presents occasions requiring His aid\r\n     and guidance.\r\n\r\n     7. Turning again to ordinary duty, I know no precept more wide or\r\n     more valuable than this: cultivate self-help; do not seek nor like\r\n     to be dependent upon others for what you can yourself supply; and\r\n     keep down as much as you can the standard of your wants, for in\r\n     this lies a great secret of manliness, _true_ wealth, and\r\n     happiness; as, on the other hand, the multiplication of our wants\r\n     makes us effeminate and slavish, as well as selfish.\r\n\r\n     8. In regard to money as well as to time, there is a great\r\n     advantage in its methodical use. Especially is it wise to dedicate\r\n     a certain portion of our means to purposes of charity and religion,\r\n     and this is more easily begun in youth than in after life. The\r\n     greatest advantage of making a little fund of this kind is that\r\n     when we are asked to give, the competition is not between _self_ on\r\n     the one hand and charity on the other, but between the different\r\n     purposes of religion and charity with one another, among which we\r\n     ought to make the most careful choice. It is desirable that the\r\n     fund thus devoted should not be less than one-tenth of our means;\r\n     and it tends to bring a blessing on the rest.\r\n\r\n     9. Besides giving this, we should save something, so as to be\r\n     before the world, _i.e._ to have some preparation to meet the\r\n     accidents and unforeseen calls of life as well as its general\r\n     future.\r\n\r\nFathers are generally wont to put their better mind into counsels to\r\ntheir sons. In this instance the counsellor was the living pattern of\r\nhis own maxims. His account-books show in full detail that he never at\r\nany time in his life devoted less than a tenth of his annual incomings\r\nto charitable and religious objects. The peculiarity of all this\r\nhalf-mechanic ordering of a wise and virtuous individual life, was that\r\nit went with a genius and power that 'moulded a mighty State's decrees,'\r\nand sought the widest 'process of the suns.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\n                              MENTAL GROWTH\r\n\r\nOnce more, his whole temper and spirit turned to practice. His thrift of\r\ntime, his just and regulated thrift in money, his hatred of waste, were\r\nonly matched by his eager and minute attention in affairs of public\r\nbusiness. He knew how to be content with small savings of hours and of\r\nmaterial resources. He was not downcast if progress were slow. In\r\nwatching public opinion, in feeling the pulse of a cabinet, in softening\r\nthe heart of a colleague, even when skies were gloomiest, he was almost\r\nprovokingly anxious to detect signs of encouragement that to others were\r\nimperceptible. He was of the mind of the Roman emperor, 'Hope not for\r\nthe republic of Plato; but be content with ever so small an advance, and\r\nlook on even that as a gain worth having.'[127] A commonplace, but not\r\none of the commonplaces that are always laid to heart.\r\n\r\nIf faith was one clue, then next to faith was growth. The fundamentals\r\nof Christian dogma, so far as I know and am entitled to speak, are the\r\nonly region in which Mr. Gladstone's opinions have no history.\r\nEverywhere else we look upon incessant movement; in views about church\r\nand state, tests, national schools; in questions of economic and fiscal\r\npolicy; in relations with party; in the questions of popular\r\ngovernment--in every one of these wide spheres of public interest he\r\npasses from crisis to crisis. The dealings of church and state made the\r\nfirst of these marked stages in the history of his opinions and his\r\nlife, but it was only the beginning.\r\n\r\n     I was born with smaller natural endowments than you, he wrote to\r\n     his old friend Sir Francis Doyle (1880), and I had also a narrower\r\n     early training. But my life has certainly been remarkable for the\r\n     mass of continuous and searching experience it has brought me ever\r\n     since I began to pass out of boyhood. I have been feeling my way;\r\n     owing little to living teachers, but enormously to four dead\r\n     ones[128] (over and above the four gospels). It has been experience\r\n     which has altered my politics. My toryism was accepted by me on\r\n     authority and in good faith; I did my best to fight for it. But if\r\n     you choose to examine my parliamentary life you will find that on\r\n     every subject as I came to deal with it practically, I had to deal\r\n     with it as a liberal elected in '32. I began with slavery in 1833,\r\n     and was commended by the liberal minister, Mr. Stanley. I took to\r\n     colonial subjects principally, and in 1837 was commended for\r\n     treating them liberally by Lord Russell. Then Sir R. Peel carried\r\n     me into trade, and before I had been six months in office, I wanted\r\n     to resign because I thought his corn law reform insufficient. In\r\n     ecclesiastical policy I had been a speculator; but if you choose to\r\n     refer to a speech of Sheil's in 1844 on the Dissenters' Chapels\r\n     bill,[129] you will find him describing me as predestined to be a\r\n     champion of religious equality. All this seems to show that I have\r\n     changed under the teaching of experience.\r\n\r\nAnd much later he wrote of himself:--\r\n\r\n     The stock in trade of ideas with which I set out on the career of\r\n     parliamentary life was a small one. I do not think the general\r\n     tendencies of my mind were even in the time of my youth illiberal.\r\n     It was a great accident that threw me into the anti-liberal\r\n     attitude, but having taken it up I held to it with energy. It was\r\n     the accident of the Reform bill of 1831. For teachers or idols or\r\n     both in politics I had had Mr. Burke and Mr. Canning. I followed\r\n     them in their dread of reform, and probably caricatured them as a\r\n     raw and unskilled student caricatures his master. This one idea on\r\n     which they were anti-liberal became the master-key of the\r\n     situation, and absorbed into itself for the time the whole of\r\n     politics. This, however, was not my only disadvantage. I had been\r\n     educated in an extremely narrow churchmanship, that of the\r\n     evangelical party. This narrow churchmanship too readily embraced\r\n     the idea that the extension of representative principles, which was\r\n     then the essential work of liberalism, was associated with\r\n     irreligion; an idea quite foreign to my older sentiment on behalf\r\n     of Roman catholic emancipation. (_Autobiographic note, July 22,\r\n     1894_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     VII\r\n\r\n                           LIMITATIONS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his humility, his willingness within a certain range to\r\nlearn, his profound reverence for what he took for truth, he was no more\r\nready than many far inferior men to discern a certain important rule of\r\nintellectual life that was expressed in a quaint figure by one of our\r\nold English sages. 'He is a wonderful man,' said the sage, 'that can\r\nthread a needle when he is at cudgels in a crowd; and yet this is as\r\neasy as to find Truth in the hurry of disputation.'[130] The strenuous\r\nmember of parliament, the fervid minister fighting the clauses of his\r\nbill, the disputant in cabinet, when he passed from man of action to the\r\ntopics of balanced thought, nice scrutiny, long meditation, did not\r\nalways succeed in getting his thread into the needle's eye.\r\n\r\nAs to the problems of the metaphysician, Mr. Gladstone showed little\r\ncuriosity. Nor for abstract discussion in its highest shape--for\r\ninvestigation of ultimate propositions--had he any of that power of\r\nsubtle and ingenious reasoning which was often so extraordinary when he\r\ncame to deal with the concrete, the historic, and the demonstrable. A\r\nstill more singular limitation on the extent of his intellectual\r\ncuriosity was hardly noticed at this early epoch. The scientific\r\nmovement, which along with the growth of democracy and the growth of\r\nindustrialism formed the three propelling forces of a new age,--was not\r\nyet developed in all its range. The astonishing discoveries in the realm\r\nof natural science, and the philosophic speculations that were built\r\nupon them, though quite close at hand, were still to come. Darwin's\r\n_Origin of Species_, for example, was not given to the world until 1859.\r\nMr. Gladstone watched these things vaguely and with misgiving; instinct\r\nmust have told him that the advance of natural explanation, whether\r\nlegitimately or not, would be in some degree at the expense of the\r\nsupernatural. But from any full or serious examination of the details of\r\nthe scientific movement he stood aside, safe and steadfast within the\r\ncitadel of Tradition.\r\n\r\nHe was once asked to subscribe to a memorial of Tyndale, the translator\r\nof the Bible,[131] and he put his refusal upon grounds that show one\r\nsource at least of his scruple about words. He replies that he has been\r\ndriven to a determination to renounce all subscriptions for the\r\ncommemoration of ancient worthies, as he finds that he cannot signify\r\ngratitude for services rendered, without being understood to sanction\r\nall that they have said or done, and thus becoming involved in\r\ncontroversy or imputation about them. 'I am often amazed,' he goes on,\r\n'at the construction put upon my acts and words; but experience has\r\nshown me that they are commonly put under the microscope, and then found\r\nto contain all manner of horrors, like the animalcules in Thames water.'\r\nThis microscope was far too valuable an instrument in the contentions of\r\nparty, ever to be put aside; and the animalcules, duly magnified to the\r\nfrightful size required, were turned into first-rate electioneering\r\nagents. Even without party microscopes, those who feel most warmly for\r\nMr. Gladstone's manifold services to his country, may often wish that he\r\nhad inscribed in letters of gold over the door of the Temple of Peace, a\r\ncertain sentence from the wise oracles of his favourite Butler. 'For the\r\nconclusion of this,' said the bishop, 'let me just take notice of the\r\ndanger of over-great refinements; of going beside or beyond the plain,\r\nobvious first appearances of things, upon the subject of morals and\r\nreligion.'[132] Nor would he have said less of politics. It is idle to\r\nignore in Mr. Gladstone's style an over-refining in words, an excess of\r\nqualifying propositions, a disproportionate impressiveness in verbal\r\nshadings without real difference. Nothing irritated opponents more. They\r\ninsisted on taking literary sin for moral obliquity, and because men\r\ncould not understand, they assumed that he wished to mislead. Yet if we\r\nremember how carelessness in words, how the slovenly combination under\r\nthe same name of things entirely different, how the taking for granted\r\nas matter of positive proof what is at the most only possible or barely\r\nprobable--when we think of all the mischief and folly that has been\r\nwrought in the world by loose habits of mind that are almost as much the\r\nmaster vice of the head as selfishness is the master vice of the heart,\r\nmen may forgive Mr. Gladstone for what passed as sophistry and subtlety,\r\nbut was in truth scruple of conscience in that region where lack of\r\nscruple half spoils the world.\r\n\r\n                           VERBAL REFINING\r\n\r\nThis peculiar trait was connected with another that sometimes amused\r\nfriends, but always exasperated foes. Among the papers is a letter from\r\nan illustrious man to Mr. Gladstone--wickedly no better dated by the\r\nwriter than 'Saturday,' and no better docketed by the receiver than 'T.\r\nB. Macaulay, March 1,'--showing that Mr. Gladstone was just as\r\nenergetic, say in some year between 1835 and 1850, in defending the\r\nentire consistency between a certain speech of the dubious date and a\r\nspeech in 1833, as he ever afterwards showed himself in the same too\r\nfamiliar process. In later times he described himself as a sort of\r\npurist in what touches the consistency of statesmen. 'Change of\r\nopinion,' he said, 'in those to whose judgment the public looks more or\r\nless to assist its own, is an evil to the country, although a much\r\nsmaller evil than their persistence in a course which they know to be\r\nwrong. It is not always to be blamed. But it is always to be watched\r\nwith vigilance; always to be challenged and put upon its trial.'[133] To\r\nthis challenge in his own case--and no man of his day was half so often\r\nput upon his trial for inconsistency--he was always most easily provoked\r\nto make a vehement reply. In that process Mr. Gladstone's natural habit\r\nof resort to qualifying words, and his skill in showing that a new\r\nattitude could be reconciled by strict reasoning with the logical\r\ncontents of old dicta, gave him wonderful advantage. His adversary, as\r\nhe strode confidently along the smooth grass, suddenly found himself\r\ntreading on a serpent; he had overlooked a condition, a proviso, a word\r\nof hypothesis or contingency, that sprang from its ambush and brought\r\nhis triumph to naught on the spot. If Mr. Gladstone had only taken as\r\nmuch trouble that his hearers should understand exactly what it was that\r\nhe meant, as he took trouble afterwards to show that his meaning had\r\nbeen grossly misunderstood, all might have been well. As it was, he\r\nseemed to be completely satisfied if he could only show that two\r\npropositions, thought by plain men to be directly contradictory, were\r\nall the time capable on close construction of being presented in perfect\r\nharmony. As if I had a right to look only to what my words literally\r\nmean or may in good logic be made to mean, and had no concern at all\r\nwith what the people meant who used the same words, or with what I\r\nmight have known that my hearers were all the time supposing me to mean.\r\nHope-Scott once wrote to him (November 24, 1841): 'We live in a time in\r\nwhich accurate distinctions, especially in theology, are absolutely\r\nunconsidered. The \"common sense\" or general tenor of questions is what\r\nalone the majority of men are guided by. And I verily believe that\r\nsemi-arian confessions or any others turning upon nicety of thought and\r\nexpression, would be for the most part considered as fitter subjects for\r\nscholastic dreamers than for earnest Christians.' In politics at any\r\nrate, Bishop Butler was wiser.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of what was assailed as inconsistency is perhaps a\r\ndouble one. In the first place he started on his journey with an\r\nintellectual chart of ideas and principles not adequate or well fitted\r\nfor the voyage traced for him by the spirit of his age. If he held to\r\nthe inadequate ideas with which Oxford and Canning and his father and\r\neven Peel had furnished him, he would have been left helpless and\r\nuseless in the days stretching before him. The second point is that the\r\norator of Mr. Gladstone's commanding school exists by virtue of large\r\nand intense expression; then if circumstances make him as vehement for\r\none opinion to-day as he was vehement for what the world regards as a\r\nconflicting opinion yesterday, his intellectual self-respect naturally\r\nprompts him to insist that the opinions do not really clash, but are in\r\nfact identical. You may call this a weakness if you choose, and it\r\ncertainly involved Mr. Gladstone in much unfruitful and not very\r\nedifying exertion; but it is at any rate better than the front of brass\r\nthat takes any change of opinion for matter-of-course expedient, as to\r\nwhich the least said will be soonest mended. And it is better still than\r\nthe disastrous self-consciousness that makes a man persist in a foolish\r\nthing to-day, because he chanced to say or do a foolish thing yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\n                               MINOR MORALS\r\n\r\nIn this period of his life, with the battle of the world still to come,\r\nMr. Gladstone to whose grave temperament everything, little or great,\r\nwas matter of deliberate reflection, of duty and scruple, took early\r\nnote of minor morals as well as major. Characteristically he found some\r\nfault with a sermon of Dr. Wordsworth's upon Saint Barnabas, for\r\n\r\n     hardly pushing the argument for the connection of good manners with\r\n     Christianity to the full extent of which it is fairly capable. The\r\n     whole system of legitimate courtesy, politeness, and refinement is\r\n     surely nothing less than one of the genuine though minor and often\r\n     unacknowledged results of the gospel scheme. All the great moral\r\n     qualities or graces, which in their large sphere determine the\r\n     formation and habits of the Christian soul as before God, do also\r\n     on a smaller scale apply to the very same principles in the common\r\n     intercourse of life, and pervade its innumerable and separately\r\n     inappreciable particulars; and the result of this application is\r\n     that good breeding which distinguishes Christian civilisation.\r\n     (March 31, 1844.)\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to discuss whether the breeding of Plato or Cicero or\r\nthe Arabs of Cordova was better or worse than the breeding of the\r\neastern bishops at Nicaea or Ephesus. Good manners, we may be sure,\r\nhardly have a single master-key, unless it be simplicity, or freedom\r\nfrom the curse of affectation. What is certain is that nobody of his\r\ntime was a finer example of high good manners and genuine courtesy than\r\nMr. Gladstone himself. He has left a little sheaf of random jottings\r\nwhich, without being subtle or recondite, show how he looked on this\r\nside of human things. Here is an example or two:--\r\n\r\n     There are a class of passages in Mr. Wilberforce's _Journals_,\r\n     _e.g._, some of those recording his successful speeches, which\r\n     might in many men be set down to vanity, but in him are more fairly\r\n     I should think ascribable to a singlemindedness which did not\r\n     inflate. Surely with _most_ men it is the safest rule, to make\r\n     scanty records of success achieved, and yet more rarely to notice\r\n     praise, which should pass us like the breeze, enjoyed but not\r\n     arrested. There must indeed be some sign, a stone as it were set\r\n     up, to remind us that such and such were occasions for\r\n     thankfulness; but should not the memorials be restricted wholly and\r\n     expressly for this purpose? For the fumes of praise are rapidly and\r\n     fearfully intoxicating; it comes like a spark to the tow if once\r\n     we give it, as it were, admission within us. (1838.)\r\n\r\n     There are those to whom vanity brings more of pain than of\r\n     pleasure; there are also those whom it oftener keeps in the\r\n     background, than thrusts forward. The same man who to-day\r\n     volunteers for that which he is not called upon to do, may\r\n     to-morrow flinch from his obvious duty from one and the same\r\n     cause,--vanity, or regard to the appearance he is to make, for its\r\n     own sake, and perhaps that vanity which shrinks is a more subtle\r\n     and far-sighted, a more ethereal, a more profound vanity than that\r\n     which presumes. (1842.)\r\n\r\n     A question of immense importance meets us in ethical inquiries, as\r\n     follows: is there a sense in which it is needful, right, and\r\n     praiseworthy, that man should be much habituated to look back upon\r\n     himself and keep his eye upon himself; a self-regard, and even a\r\n     self-respect, which are compatible with the self-renunciation and\r\n     self-distrust which belong to Christianity? In the observance of a\r\n     single distinction we shall find, perhaps, a secure and sufficient\r\n     answer. We are to respect our responsibilities, not ourselves. We\r\n     are to respect the duties of which we are capable, but not our\r\n     capabilities simply considered. There is to be no complacent\r\n     self-contemplation, beruminating upon self. When self is viewed, it\r\n     must always be in the most intimate connection with its purposes.\r\n     How well were it if persons would be more careful, or rather, more\r\n     conscientious, in paying compliments. How often do we delude\r\n     another, in subject matter small or great, into the belief that he\r\n     has done well what we know he has done ill, either by silence, or\r\n     by so giving him praise on a particular point as to _imply_\r\n     approbation of the whole. Now it is undoubtedly difficult to\r\n     observe politeness in all cases compatibly with truth; and\r\n     politeness though a minor duty is a duty still. (1838.)\r\n\r\n     If truth permits you to praise, but binds you to praise with a\r\n     qualification, observe how much more acceptably you will speak, if\r\n     you put the qualification first, than if you postpone it. For\r\n     example: 'this is a good likeness; but it is a hard painting,' is\r\n     surely much less pleasing, than 'this is a hard painting; but it is\r\n     a good likeness.' The qualification is generally taken to be more\r\n     genuinely the sentiment of the speaker's mind, than the main\r\n     proposition; and it carries ostensible honesty and manliness to\r\n     propose first what is the less acceptable. (1835-6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                          SPIRIT OF SUBMISSION\r\n\r\nTo go back to Fenelon's question about his own foundation. 'The great\r\nwork of religion,' as Mr. Gladstone conceived it, was set out in some\r\nsentences of a letter written by him to Mrs. Gladstone in 1844, five\r\nyears after they were married. In these sentences we see that under all\r\nthe agitated surface of a life of turmoil and contention, there flowed a\r\ndeep composing stream of faith, obedience, and resignation, that gave\r\nhim, in face of a thousand buffets, the free mastery of all his\r\nresources of heart and brain:--\r\n\r\n     _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     13 _C.H. Terrace, Sunday evening, Jan. 21, 1844._--Although I have\r\n     carelessly left at the board of trade with your other letters that\r\n     on which I wished to have said something, yet I am going to end\r\n     this day of peace by a few words to show that what you said did not\r\n     lightly pass away from my mind. There is a beautiful little\r\n     sentence in the works of Charles Lamb concerning one who had been\r\n     afflicted: 'he gave his heart to the Purifier, and his will to the\r\n     Sovereign Will of the Universe.'[134] But there is a speech in the\r\n     third canto of the _Paradiso_ of Dante, spoken by a certain\r\n     Piccarda, which is a rare gem. I will only quote this one line:\r\n\r\n       _In la sua volontade e nostra pace._[135]\r\n\r\n     The words are few and simple, and yet they appear to me to have an\r\n     inexpressible majesty of truth about them, to be almost as if they\r\n     were spoken from the very mouth of God. It so happened that (unless\r\n     my memory much deceives me) I first read that speech on a morning\r\n     early in the year 1836, which was one of trial. I was profoundly\r\n     impressed and powerfully sustained, almost absorbed, by these\r\n     words. They cannot be too deeply graven upon the heart. In short,\r\n     what we all want is that they should not come to us as an\r\n     admonition from without, but as an instinct from within. They\r\n     should not be adopted by effort or upon a process of proof, but\r\n     they should be simply the translation into speech of the habitual\r\n     tone to which all tempers, affections, emotions, are set. In the\r\n     Christian mood, which ought never to be intermitted, the sense of\r\n     this conviction should recur spontaneously; it should be the\r\n     foundation of all mental thoughts and acts, and the measure to\r\n     which the whole experience of life, inward and outward, is\r\n     referred. The final state which we are to contemplate with hope,\r\n     and to seek by discipline, is that in which our will shall be _one_\r\n     with the will of God; not merely shall submit to it, not merely\r\n     shall follow after it, but shall live and move with it, even as the\r\n     pulse of the blood in the extremities acts with the central\r\n     movement of the heart. And this is to be obtained through a double\r\n     process; the first, that of checking, repressing, quelling the\r\n     inclination of the will to act with reference to self as a centre;\r\n     this is to mortify it. The second, to cherish, exercise, and expand\r\n     its new and heavenly power of acting according to the will of God,\r\n     first, perhaps, by painful effort in great feebleness and with many\r\n     inconsistencies, but with continually augmenting regularity and\r\n     force, until obedience become a necessity of second nature....\r\n\r\n     Resignation is too often conceived to be merely a submission not\r\n     unattended with complaint to what we have no power to avoid. But it\r\n     is less than the whole of a work of a Christian. Your full triumph\r\n     as far as that particular occasion of duty is concerned will be to\r\n     find that you not merely repress inward tendencies to murmur--but\r\n     that you would not if you could alter what in any matter God has\r\n     plainly willed.... Here is the great work of religion; here is the\r\n     path through which sanctity is attained, the highest sanctity; and\r\n     yet it is a path evidently to be traced in the course of our daily\r\n     duties....\r\n\r\n     When we are thwarted in the exercise of some innocent, laudable,\r\n     and almost sacred affection, as in the case, though its scale be\r\n     small, out of which all of this has grown, Satan has us at an\r\n     advantage, because when the obstacle occurs, we have a sentiment\r\n     that the feeling baffled is a right one, and in indulging a\r\n     rebellious temper we flatter ourselves that we are merely as it\r\n     were indulgent on behalf, not of ourselves, but of a duty which we\r\n     have been interrupted in performing. But our duties can take care\r\n     of themselves when God calls us away from any of them.... To be\r\n     able to relinquish a duty upon command shows a higher grace than to\r\n     be able to give up a mere pleasure for a duty....\r\n\r\n                      RESPONSIBILITY FOR GIFTS\r\n\r\nThe resignation thus described with all this power and deep feeling is,\r\nof course, in one form of thoughts and words, of symbol and synthesis,\r\nor another, the foundation of all the great systems of life. A summary\r\nof Mr. Gladstone's interpretation of it is perhaps found in a few words\r\nused by him of Blanco White, a heterodox writer whose strange spiritual\r\nfortunes painfully interested and perplexed him. 'He cherished,' says\r\nMr. Gladstone, 'with whatever associations, the love of God, and\r\nmaintained resignation to His will, even when it appears almost\r\nimpossible to see how he could have had a dogmatic belief in the\r\nexistence of a divine will at all. There was, in short [in Blanco\r\nWhite], a disposition _to resist the tyranny of self; to recognise the\r\nrule of duty; to maintain the supremacy of the higher over the lower\r\nparts of our nature_.'[136] This very disposition might with truth no\r\nless assured have been assigned to the writer himself. These three\r\nbright crystal laws of life were to him like pointer stars guiding a\r\ntraveller's eye to the celestial pole by which he steers.\r\n\r\nWhen all has been said of a man's gifts, the critical question still\r\nstands over, how he regards his responsibility for using them. Once in a\r\nconversation with Mr. Gladstone, some fifty years from the epoch of this\r\npresent chapter, we fell upon the topic of ambition. 'Well,' he said, 'I\r\ndo not think that I can tax myself in my own life with ever having been\r\nmuch moved by ambition.' The remark so astonished me that, as he\r\nafterwards playfully reported to a friend, I almost jumped up from my\r\nchair. We soon shall reach a stage in his career when both remark and\r\nsurprise may explain themselves. We shall see that if ambition means\r\nlove of power or fame for the sake of glitter, decoration, external\r\nrenown, or even dominion and authority on their own account--and all\r\nthese are common passions enough in strong natures as well as weak--then\r\nhis view of himself was just. I think he had none of it. Ambition in a\r\nbetter sense, the motion of a resolute and potent genius to use strength\r\nfor the purposes of strength, to clear the path, dash obstacles aside,\r\nforce good causes forward--such a quality as that is the very law of the\r\nbeing of a personality so vigorous, intrepid, confident, and capable as\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] Hawarden Grammar School, Sept. 19, 1877.\r\n\r\n[113] Mr. Gladstone on Lord Houghton's _Life_; _Speaker_, Nov. 29, 1890.\r\n\r\n[114] _Gleanings_, vii. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[115] _Homeric Studies_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[116] Book ii.

As to those, one entry in the\r\ndiary (Feb. 1st, 1839) tells a sufficient tale for the next two years.\r\n'I find I have, besides family and parliamentary concerns and those of\r\nstudy, _ten_ committees on hand: Milbank, Society for Propagation of the\r\nGospel, Church Building Metropolis, Church Commercial School, National\r\nSchools inquiry and correspondence, Upper Canada, Clergy, Additional\r\nCurates' Fund, Carlton Library, Oxford and Cambridge Club. These things\r\ndistract and dissipate my mind.' Well they might; for in any man with\r\nless than Mr. Gladstone's amazing faculty of rapid and powerful\r\nconcentration, such dispersion must have been disastrous both to\r\neffectiveness and to mental progress. As it is, I find little in the way\r\nof central facts to remark in either mental history or public action. He\r\nstrayed away occasionally from the Fathers and their pastures and dipped\r\ninto the new literature of the hour, associated with names of dawning\r\npopularity. Carlyle he found hard to lay down. Some of Emerson, too, he\r\nbecame acquainted with, as we have already seen; but his mind was far\r\ntoo closely filled with transcendentalisms of his own to offer much\r\nhospitality to the serene and beautiful transcendentalism of Emerson. He\r\nread _Oliver Twist_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_, and on the latter he makes\r\na characteristic comment--'the tone is very human; it is most happy in\r\ntouches of natural pathos. No church in the book, and the motives are\r\nnot those of religion.' So with Hallam's _History of Literature_,\r\n'Finished (Oct. 10, 1839) his theological chapter, in which I am sorry\r\nto find amidst such merits, what is even far more grievous than his\r\nanti-church sarcasms, such notions on original sin as in iv. p. 161.' He\r\nfound Chillingworth's _Religion of Protestants_ 'a work of the most\r\nmixed merits,' an ambiguous phrase which I take to mean not that its\r\nmerits were various, but that they were much mixed with those demerits\r\nfor which the puritan Cheynell baited the unlucky latitudinarian to\r\ndeath. About this time also he first began Father Paul's famous history\r\nof the Council of Trent, a work that always stood as high in his esteem\r\nas in Macaulay's, who liked Sarpi the best of all modern historians.\r\n\r\nTo the great veteran poet of the time Mr. Gladstone's fidelity was\r\nunchanging, even down to compositions that the ordinary Wordsworthian\r\ngives up:--\r\n\r\n     Read aloud Wordsworth's _Cumberland Beggar_ and _Peter Bell_. The\r\n     former is generally acknowledged to be a noble poem. The same\r\n     justice is not done to the latter; I was more than ever struck with\r\n     the vivid power of the descriptions, the strong touches of feeling,\r\n     the skill and order with which the plot upon Peter's conscience is\r\n     arranged, and the depth of interest which is made to attach to the\r\n     humblest of quadrupeds. It must have cost great labour, and is an\r\n     extraordinary poem, both as a whole and in detail.\r\n\r\nLet not the scorner forget that Matthew Arnold, that admirable critic\r\nand fine poet, confesses to reading _Peter Bell_ with pleasure and\r\nedification.\r\n\r\nIn the political field he moved steadily on. Sir R. Peel spoke to him\r\n(April 19, 1839) in the House about the debate and wished him to speak\r\nafter Sheil, if Graham, who was to speak about 8 or 9, could bring him\r\nup. Peel showed him several points with regard to the committee which he\r\nthought might be urged. 'This is very kind in him as a mark of\r\nconfidence; and assures me that if, as I suspect, he considers my book\r\nas likely to bring me into some embarrassment individually, yet he is\r\nwilling to let me still act under him, and fight my own battles in that\r\nmatter as best with God's help I may, which is thoroughly fair. It\r\nimposes, however, a great responsibility. I was not presumptuous enough\r\nto dream of following Sheil; not that his speech is formidable, but the\r\nimpression it leaves on the House is. I meant to provoke him. A mean man\r\nmay fire at a tiger, but it requires a strong and bold one to stand his\r\ncharge; and the longer I live, the more I feel my own (intrinsically)\r\nutter _powerlessness_ in the House of Commons. But my principle is\r\nthis--not to shrink from any such responsibility when laid upon me by a\r\ncompetent person. Sheil, however, did not speak, so I am reserved and\r\nmay fulfil my own idea, please God, to-night.'\r\n\r\n                           THE JAMAICA CASE\r\n\r\nWe come now to one of the memorable episodes in this vexed decade of our\r\npolitical history. The sullen demon of slavery died hard. The negro\r\nstill wore about his neck galling links of the broken chain. The\r\ntransitory stage of apprenticeship was in some respects even harsher\r\nthan the bondage from which it was to bring deliverance, and the old\r\niniquity only worked in new ways. The pity and energy of the humane at\r\nhome drove a perplexed and sluggish government to pass an act for\r\ndealing with the abominations of the prisons to which the unhappy blacks\r\nwere committed in Jamaica. The assembly of that island, a planter\r\noligarchy, resented the new law from the mother country as an invasion\r\nof their constitutional rights, and stubbornly refused in their\r\nexasperation, even after a local dissolution, to perform duties that\r\nwere indispensable for working the machinery of administration. The\r\ncabinet in consequence asked parliament (April 9th) to suspend the\r\nconstitution of Jamaica for a term of five years. The tory opposition,\r\nled by Peel with all his force, aided by the aversion of a section of\r\nthe liberals to a measure in which they detected a flavour of\r\ndictatorship, ran the ministers (May 6th) within five votes of defeat on\r\na cardinal stage.\r\n\r\n'I was amused,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'with observing yesterday the\r\ndifferences of countenance and manner in the ministers whom I met on my\r\nride. Ellice (their friend) would not look at me at all. Charles Wood\r\nlooked but askance and with the hat over the brow. Grey shouted, \"Wish\r\nyou joy!\" Lord Howick gave a remarkably civil and smiling nod; and\r\nMorpeth a hand salute with all his might, as we crossed in riding. On\r\nMonday night after the division, Peel said just as it was known and\r\nabout to be announced, \"Jamaica was a good horse to start.\"' Of his own\r\nshare in the performance, Mr. Gladstone only says that he spoke a dry\r\nspeech to a somewhat reluctant House. 'I cannot work up my matter at all\r\nin such a plight. However, considering what it was, they behaved very\r\nwell. A loud cheer on the announcement of the numbers from our people,\r\nin which I did not join.'\r\n\r\nTo have won the race by so narrow a majority as five seemed to the\r\nwhigs, wearied of their own impotence and just discredit, a good plea\r\nfor getting out of office. Peel proceeded to begin the formation of a\r\ngovernment, but the operation broke down upon an affair of the\r\nbedchamber. He supposed the Queen to object to the removal of any of the\r\nladies of her household, and the Queen supposed him to insist on the\r\nremoval of them all. The situation was unedifying and nonsensical, but\r\nthe Queen was not yet twenty, and Lord Melbourne had for once failed to\r\nteach a prudent lesson. A few days saw Melbourne back in office, and in\r\noffice he remained for two years longer.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                                MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nIn June 1839 the understanding arrived at with Miss Catherine Glynne\r\nduring the previous winter in Sicily, ripened into a definite\r\nengagement, and on the 25th of the following July their marriage took\r\nplace amid much rejoicing and festivity at Hawarden. At the same time\r\nand place, Mary Glynne, the younger sister, was married to Lord\r\nLyttelton. Sir Stephen Glynne, their brother, was the ninth, and as was\r\nto happen, the last baronet. Their mother, born Mary Neville, was the\r\ndaughter of the second Lord Braybrooke and Mary Grenville his wife,\r\nsister of the first Marquis of Buckingham. Hence Lady Glynne was one of\r\na historic clan, granddaughter of George Grenville, the minister of\r\nAmerican taxation, and niece of William, Lord Grenville, head of the\r\ncabinet of All the Talents in 1806. She was first cousin therefore of\r\nthe younger Pitt, and the Glynnes could boast of a family connection\r\nwith three prime ministers, or if we choose to add Lord Chatham who\r\nmarried Hester Grenville, with four.[138] 'I told her,' Mr. Gladstone\r\nrecorded on this occasion of their engagement (June 8th), 'what was my\r\noriginal destination and desire in life; in what sense and manner I\r\nremained in connection with politics.... I have given her (led by her\r\nquestions) these passages for canons of our living:--\r\n\r\n  'Le fronde, onde s'infronda tutto l'orto\r\n   Dell' Ortolano eterno, am' io cotanto,\r\n   Quanto da lui a lor di bene e porto.'[139]\r\n\r\nAnd Dante again--\r\n\r\n  'In la sua volontade e nostra pace:\r\n   Ella e quel mare, al qual tutto si muove.'[140]\r\n\r\nIn few human unions have the good hopes and fond wishes of a bridal day\r\nbeen better fulfilled or brought deeper and more lasting content. Sixty\r\nlong years after, Mr. Gladstone said, 'It would not be possible to\r\nunfold in words the value of the gifts which the bounty of Providence\r\nhas conferred upon me through her.' And the blessing remained radiant\r\nand unclouded to the distant end.\r\n\r\nAt the close of August, after posting across Scotland from Greenock by a\r\nroute better known now than then to every tourist, the young couple made\r\ntheir way to Fasque, where the new bride found an auspicious approach\r\nand the kindest of welcomes. Her 'entrance into her adoptive family was\r\nmuch more formidable than it would be to those who had been less loved,\r\nor less influential, or less needed and leant upon, in the home where\r\nshe was so long a queen.' At Fasque all went as usual. Soon after his\r\narrival, his father communicated that he meant actually to transfer to\r\nhis sons his Demerara properties--Robertson to have the management.\r\n'This increased wealth, so much beyond my needs, with its attendant\r\nresponsibility is very burdensome, however on his part the act be\r\nbeautiful.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary session of 1840 was unimportant and dreary. The\r\ngovernment was tottering, the conservative leaders were in no hurry to\r\npluck the pear before it was ripe, and the only men with any animating\r\nprinciple of active public policy in them were Cobden and the League\r\nagainst the Corn Law. The attention of the House of Commons was mainly\r\ncentred in the case of Stockdale and the publication of debates. But Mr.\r\nGladstone's most earnest thoughts were still far away from what he found\r\nto be the dry sawdust of the daily politics, as the following lines may\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\n     _March 16th, 1849._--Manning dined with us. He kindly undertook\r\n     to revise my manuscript on 'Church Principles.'\r\n\r\n     _March 18th._--Yesterday I had a long conversation with James\r\n     Hope. He came to tell me, with great generosity, that he would\r\n     always respond to any call, according to the best of his power,\r\n     which I might make on him for the behalf of the common cause--he\r\n     had given up all views of advancement in his profession--he had\r\n     about L400 a year, and this, which includes his fellowship, was\r\n     quite sufficient for his wants; his time would be devoted to\r\n     church objects; in the intermediate region he considered himself as\r\n     having the first tonsure.\r\n\r\n     Hope urged strongly the principle, 'Let every man abide in the\r\n     calling ----' I thought even over strongly. My belief is that he\r\n     foregoes the ministry from deeming himself unworthy.... The object\r\n     of my letter to Hope was in part to record on paper my abhorrence\r\n     of party in the church, whether Oxford party or any other.\r\n\r\n     _March 18th._--To-day a meeting at Peel's on the China question;\r\n     considered in the view of censure upon the conduct of the\r\n     administration, and a motion will accordingly be made objecting to\r\n     the attempts to force the Chinese to modify their old relations\r\n     with us, and to the leaving the superintendent without military\r\n     force. It was decided not to move simultaneously in the\r\n     Lords--particularly because the radicals would, if there were a\r\n     double motion, act not on the merits but for the ministry.\r\n     Otherwise, it seemed to be thought we should carry a motion. The\r\n     Duke of Wellington said, 'God! if it is carried, they will go,'\r\n     that they were as near as possible to resignation on the last\r\n     defeat, and would not stand it again. Peel said, he understood four\r\n     ministers were then strongly for resigning. The duke also said, our\r\n     footing in China could not be re-established, unless under some\r\n     considerable naval and military demonstration, now that matters had\r\n     gone so far. He appeared pale and shaken, but spoke loud and a good\r\n     deal, much to the point and with considerable gesticulation. The\r\n     mind's life I never saw more vigorous.\r\n\r\n                          THE CHINA QUESTION\r\n\r\nThe Chinese question was of the simplest. British subjects insisted on\r\nsmuggling opium into China in the teeth of Chinese law. The British\r\nagent on the spot began war against China for protecting herself against\r\nthese malpractices. There was no pretence that China was in the wrong,\r\nfor in fact the British government had sent out orders that the\r\nopium-smugglers should not be shielded; but the orders arrived too late,\r\nand war having begun, Great Britain felt bound to see it through, with\r\nthe result that China was compelled to open four ports, to cede Hong\r\nKong, and to pay an indemnity of six hundred thousand pounds. So true is\r\nit that statesmen have no concern with pater nosters, the Sermon on the\r\nMount, or the _vade mecum_ of the moralist. We shall soon see that this\r\ntransaction began to make Mr. Gladstone uneasy, as was indeed to be\r\nexpected in anybody who held that a state should have a conscience.[141]\r\nOn April 8, 1840, his journal says: 'Read on China. House.... Spoke\r\nheavily; strongly against the trade and the war, having previously asked\r\nwhether my speaking out on them would do harm, and having been\r\nauthorised.' An unguarded expression brought him into a debating scrape,\r\nbut his speech abounded in the pure milk of what was to be the\r\nGladstonian word:--\r\n\r\n     I do not know how it can be urged as a crime against the Chinese\r\n     that they refused provisions to those who refused obedience to\r\n     their laws whilst residing within their territory. I am not\r\n     competent to judge how long this war may last, nor how protracted\r\n     may be its operations, but this I can say, that a war more unjust\r\n     in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this\r\n     country with disgrace, I do not know and I have not read of. Mr.\r\n     Macaulay spoke last night in eloquent terms of the British flag\r\n     waving in glory at Canton, and of the animating effect produced\r\n     upon the minds of our sailors by the knowledge that in no country\r\n     under heaven was it permitted to be insulted. But how comes it to\r\n     pass that the sight of that flag always raises the spirits of\r\n     Englishmen? It is because it has always been associated with the\r\n     cause of justice, with opposition to oppression, with respect for\r\n     national rights, with honourable commercial enterprise, but now\r\n     under the auspices of the noble lord [Palmerston] that flag is\r\n     hoisted to protect an infamous contraband traffic, and if it were\r\n     never to be hoisted except as it is now hoisted on the coast of\r\n     China, we should recoil from its sight with horror, and should\r\n     never again feel our hearts thrill, as they now thrill, with\r\n     emotion when it floats magnificently and in pride upon the\r\n     breeze.... Although the Chinese were undoubtedly guilty of much\r\n     absurd phraseology, of no little ostentatious pride, and of some\r\n     excess, justice in my opinion is with them, and whilst they the\r\n     pagans and semi-civilised barbarians have it, we the enlightened\r\n     and civilised Christians are pursuing objects at variance both with\r\n     justice and with religion.[142]\r\n\r\n     _May 14th._--Consulted [various persons] on opium. All but Sir R.\r\n     Inglis were on grounds of prudence against its [a motion against\r\n     the compensation demanded from China] being brought forward. To\r\n     this majority of friendly and competent persons I have given way, I\r\n     hope not wrongfully; but I am in dread of the judgment of God upon\r\n     England for our national iniquity towards China. It has been to me\r\n     matter of most painful and anxious consideration. I yielded\r\n     specifically to this; the majority of the persons most trustworthy\r\n     feel that to make the motion would, our leaders being in such a\r\n     position and disposition with respect to it, injure the cause.\r\n     _June 1st._--Meeting of the Society for Suppression of the Slave\r\n     Trade. [This was the occasion of a speech from Prince Albert, who\r\n     presided.] Exeter Hall crammed is really a grand spectacle. Samuel\r\n     Wilberforce a beautiful speaker; in some points resembles Macaulay.\r\n     Peel excellent. _June 12th._--This evening I voted for the Irish\r\n     education grant; on the ground that in its principle, according to\r\n     Lord Stanley's letter, it is identical practically with the English\r\n     grant of '33-8, and I might have added with the Kildare Place\r\n     grant. To exclude doctrine from exposition is in my judgment as\r\n     truly a mutilation of scripture, as to omit bodily portions of the\r\n     sacred volume.\r\n\r\n                           SOCIAL DIVERSION\r\n\r\nHis first child and eldest son was born (June 3), and Manning and Hope\r\nbecame his godfathers; these two were Mr. Gladstone's most intimate\r\nfriends at this period. Social diversions were never wanting. One June\r\nafternoon he went down to Greenwich, 'Grillion's fish dinner to the\r\nSpeaker. Great merriment; and an excellent speech from Stanley, \"good\r\nsense and good nonsense.\" A modest one from Morpeth. But though we dined\r\nat six, these expeditions do not suit me. I am ashamed of paying L2,\r\n10s. for a dinner. But on this occasion the object was to do honour to a\r\ndignified and impartial Speaker.' He had been not at all grateful, by\r\nthe way, for the high honour of admission to Grillion's dining club this\r\nyear,--'a thing quite alien to my temperament, which requires more\r\nsoothing and domestic appliances after the feverish and consuming\r\nexcitements of party life; but the rules of society oblige me to\r\nsubmit.' As it happened, so narrow is man's foreknowledge, Grillion's\r\ndown to the very end of his life, nearly sixty years ahead, had no more\r\nfaithful or congenial member.\r\n\r\n     _July 1st._--Last evening at Lambeth Palace I had a good deal of\r\n     conversation with Colonel Gurwood about the Duke of Wellington and\r\n     about Canada. He told me an anecdote of Lord Seaton which throws\r\n     light upon his peculiar reserve, and shows it to be a modesty of\r\n     character, combined no doubt with military habits and notions. When\r\n     Captain Colborne, and senior officer of his rank in the 21st foot,\r\n     he [Lord Seaton] was military secretary to General Fox during the\r\n     war. A majority in his regiment fell vacant, Gen. Fox desired him\r\n     to ascertain who was the senior captain on the _command_. 'Captain\r\n     So-and-so of the 80th [I think].' 'Write to Colonel Gordon and\r\n     recommend him to his royal highness for the vacant majority.' He\r\n     did it. The answer came to this effect: 'The recommendation will\r\n     not be refused, but we are surprised to see that it comes in the\r\n     handwriting of Captain Colborne, the very man who, according to the\r\n     rules of the service, ought to have this majority.' General Fox had\r\n     forgotten it, and Captain Colborne had not reminded him! The error\r\n     was corrected. He (Gurwood) said he had never known the Duke of\r\n     Wellington speak on the subject of religion but once, when he\r\n     quoted the story of Oliver Cromwell on his death-bed, and said:\r\n     'That state of grace, in my opinion, is a state or habit of doing\r\n     right, of persevering in duty, and to fall from it is to cease from\r\n     acting right.' He always attends the service at 8 A.M. in the\r\n     Chapel Royal, and says it is a duty which ought to be done, and the\r\n     earlier in the day it is discharged the better. _July 24th._ Heard\r\n     [James] Hope in the House of Lords against the Chapters bill; and\r\n     he spoke with such eloquence, learning, lofty sentiment, clear and\r\n     piercing diction, continuity of argument, just order, sagacious\r\n     tact, and comprehensive method, as one would say would have\r\n     required the longest experience as well as the greatest natural\r\n     gifts. Yet he never acted before, save as counsel for the Edinburgh\r\n     and Glasgow railway. If hearts are to be moved, it must be by this\r\n     speech.[143] _July 27th_.--Again went over and got up the subject\r\n     of opium compensation as it respects the Chinese. I spoke thereon\r\n     11/2 hours for the liberation of my conscience, and to afford the\r\n     friends of peace opposite an opportunity, of which they would not\r\n     avail themselves.\r\n\r\nIn August he tells Mrs. Gladstone how he has been to dine with 'such an\r\nodd party at the Guizots'; Austin, radical lawyer; John Mill, radical\r\nreviewer; M. Gaskell, Monckton Milnes, Thirlwall, new Bishop of St.\r\nDavid's, George Lewis, poor law commissioner. Not very ill mixed,\r\nhowever. The host is extremely nice.' An odd party indeed; it comprised\r\nfour at least of the strongest heads in England, and two of the most\r\nillustrious names of all the century in Europe.\r\n\r\n                          EXAMINER AT ETON\r\n\r\nIn March (1840) Mr. Gladstone and Lord Lyttelton went to Eton together\r\nto fulfil the ambitious functions of examiner for the Newcastle\r\nscholarship. In thanking Mr. Gladstone for his services, Hawtrey speaks\r\nof the advantage of public men of his stamp undertaking such duties in\r\nthe good cause of the established system of education, 'as against the\r\nnonsense of utilitarians and radicals.' The questions ran in the\r\nfamiliar mould in divinity, niceties of ancient grammar, obscurities of\r\nclassical construction, caprices of vocabulary, and all the other points\r\nof the old learning. The general merit Mr. Gladstone found 'beyond\r\nanything possible or conceivable' when he was a boy at Eton a dozen\r\nyears before:--\r\n\r\n     We sit with the boys (39 in number) and make about ten hours a day\r\n     in looking over papers with great minuteness.... Although it is in\r\n     quantity hard work, it is lightened by a warm interest, and the\r\n     refreshment of early love upon a return to this sweet place. It is\r\n     work apart from human passion, and is felt as a moral relaxation,\r\n     though it is not one in any other sense.... This is a curious\r\n     experience to me, of jaded body and mind refreshed. I propose for\r\n     Latin theme a little sentence of Burke's which runs to this effect,\r\n     'Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation\r\n     is not of more service to the people than to kings.' _April\r\n     2nd._--The statistics become excessively interesting. Henry Hallam\r\n     gained, and now stands second [the brother of his dead friend].\r\n     _April 3rd._--In, 6 hours; out, from 4 to 5 hours more upon the\r\n     papers. Vinegar, thank God, carries my eyes through so much MS.,\r\n     and the occupation is deeply interesting, especially on Hallam's\r\n     account. Our labours were at one time anxious and critical, the two\r\n     leaders being 1388 and 1390 respectively. At night, however, all\r\n     was decided. _April 4th._ 12.2.--_Viva voce_ for fourteen select.\r\n     At 21/2 Seymour was announced scholar to the boys, and chaired\r\n     forthwith. Hallam, medallist. It was quite overpowering.\r\n\r\nHenry Hallam was the second son of the historian, the junior of Arthur\r\nby some fourteen or fifteen years. Mr. Gladstone more than a generation\r\nlater described a touching supplement to his Eton story. 'In 1850 Henry\r\nHallam had attained an age exceeding only by some four years the limit\r\nof his brother's life. During that autumn I was travelling post between\r\nTurin and Genoa, upon my road to Naples. A family coach met us on the\r\nroad, and the glance of a moment at the inside showed me the familiar\r\nface of Mr. Hallam. I immediately stopped my carriage, descended, and\r\nran after his. On overtaking it, I found the dark clouds accumulated on\r\nhis brow, and learned with indescribable pain that he was on his way\r\nhome from Florence, where he had just lost his second and only remaining\r\nson, from an attack corresponding in its suddenness and its devastating\r\nrapidity with that which had struck down his eldest born son seventeen\r\nyears before.'\r\n\r\nAt Fasque, where his autumn sojourn began in September, he threw himself\r\nwith special ardour into his design for a college for Scotch\r\nepiscopalians, especially for the training of clergy. He wrote to\r\nManning (Aug. 31, 1840):--\r\n\r\n     Hope and I have been talking and writing upon a scheme for raising\r\n     money to found in Scotland a college akin in structure to the\r\n     Romish seminaries in England; that is to say, partly for training\r\n     the clergy, partly for affording an education to the children of\r\n     the gentry and others who now go chiefly to presbyterian schools or\r\n     are tended at home by presbyterian tutors. I think L25,000 would do\r\n     it, and that it might be got. I must have my father's sanction\r\n     before committing myself to it. Hope's intended absence for the\r\n     winter is a great blow. Were he to be at home I do not doubt that\r\n     great progress might be made. In the kirk toil and trouble, double,\r\n     double, the fires burn and cauldrons bubble: and though I am not\r\n     sanguine as to very speedy or extensive resumption by the church of\r\n     her spiritual rights, she may have a great part to play. At present\r\n     she is very weakly manned, and this is the way I think to\r\n     strengthen the crew.\r\n\r\n                                 GLENALMOND\r\n\r\nThe scheme expanded as time went on. His father threw himself into it\r\nwith characteristic energy and generosity, contributing many thousand\r\npounds, for the sum required greatly exceeded the modest figure above\r\nmentioned. Mr. Gladstone conducted a laborious and sometimes vexatious\r\ncorrespondence in the midst of more important public cares. Plans were\r\nmature, and adequate funds were forthcoming, and in the autumn of 1842\r\nHope and the two Gladstones made what they found an agreeable tour,\r\nexamining the various localities for a site, and finally deciding on a\r\nspot 'on a mountain-stream, ten miles from Perth, at the very gate of\r\nthe highlands.' It was 1846 before the college at Glenalmond was opened\r\nfor its destined purposes.[144] We all know examples of men holding\r\nopinions with trenchancy, decision, and even a kind of fervour, and yet\r\nwith no strong desire to spread them. Mr. Gladstone was at all times of\r\nvery different temper; consumed with missionary energy and the fire of\r\nardent propagandism.\r\n\r\n                        LETTER FROM COBDEN\r\n\r\nHe laboured hard at the fourth edition of his book, sometimes getting\r\neleven hours of work, 'a good day as times go,'--Montesquieu, Burke,\r\nBacon, Clarendon, and others of the masters of civil and historic wisdom\r\nbeing laid under ample contribution. By Christmas he was at Hawarden. In\r\nJanuary he made a speech at a meeting held in Liverpool for the\r\nfoundation of a church union, and a few days later he hurried off to\r\nWalsall to help his brother John, then the tory candidate, and a curious\r\nincident happened:--\r\n\r\n     I either provided myself, or I was furnished from headquarters,\r\n     with a packet of pamphlets in favour of the corn laws. These I\r\n     read, and I extracted from them the chief material of my speeches.\r\n     I dare say it was sad stuff, furbished up at a moment's notice. We\r\n     carried the election. Cobden sent me a challenge to attend a public\r\n     discussion of the subject. Whether this was quite fair, I am not\r\n     certain, for I was young, made no pretension to be an expert, and\r\n     had never opened my lips in parliament on the subject. But it\r\n     afforded me an excellent opportunity to decline with modesty and\r\n     with courtesy as well as reason. I am sorry to say that, to the\r\n     best of my recollection, I did far otherwise, and the pith of my\r\n     answer was made to be that I regarded the Anti-Corn Law League as\r\n     no better than a big borough-mongering association. Such was my\r\n     first capital offence in the matter of protection; redeemed from\r\n     public condemnation only by obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe letters are preserved, but a sentence or two from Mr. Gladstone's to\r\nCobden are enough. 'The phrases which you quote from a report in the\r\n_Times_ have reference, not to the corn law, but to the Anti-Corn Law\r\nLeague and its operations in Walsall. Complaining apparently of these,\r\nyou desire me to meet you in discussion, not upon the League but upon\r\nthe corn law. I cannot conceive two subjects more distinct. I admit the\r\nquestion of the repeal of the corn laws to be a subject fairly open to\r\ndiscussion, although I have a strong opinion against it. But as to the\r\nAnti-Corn Law League, I do not admit that any equitable doubt can be\r\nentertained as to the character of its present proceedings; and,\r\nexcepting a casual familiarity of phrase, I adhere rigidly to the\r\nsubstance of the sentiments which I have expressed. I know not who may\r\nbe answerable for these measures, nor was your name known to me, or in\r\nmy recollection at the time when I spoke.' Time soon changed all this,\r\nand showed who was teacher and who the learner.\r\n\r\nBy and by the session of 1841 opened, the whigs moving steadily towards\r\ntheir fall, and Mr. Gladstone almost overwhelmed with floods of domestic\r\nbusiness. He settled in the pleasant region which is to the metropolis\r\nwhat Delphi was to the habitable earth, and where, if we include in it\r\nDowning Street, he passed all the most important years of his life in\r\nLondon.[145] Though he speaks of being overwhelmed by domestic business,\r\nand he was undoubtedly hard beset by all the demands of early\r\nhousekeeping, yet he very speedily recovered his balance. He resisted\r\nnow and always as jealously as he could those promiscuous claims on time\r\nand attention by which men of less strenuous purpose suffer the\r\neffectiveness of their lives to be mutilated. 'I well know,' he writes\r\nto his young wife who was expecting him to join her at Hagley, 'you\r\nwould not have me come on any conditions with which one's sense of duty\r\ncould not be quieted, and would (I hope) send me back by the next train.\r\nThese delays are to you a practical exemplification of the difficulty of\r\nreconciling domestic and political engagements. The case is one that\r\nscarcely admits of compromise; the least that is required in order to\r\nthe fulfilment of one's duty is constant bodily presence in London until\r\nthe fag-end of the session is fairly reached.'\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of the passing days:--\r\n\r\n     _March 12th_, 1841.--_Tracts for the Times_, No. 90; ominous.\r\n     _March 13th._--Went to see Reform Club. Sat to Bradley 21/2-4. London\r\n     Library committee. Carlton Library committee. Corrected two\r\n     proof-sheets. Conversed an hour and a half with Mr. Richmond, who\r\n     came to tea, chiefly on my plan for a picture-life of Christ. Chess\r\n     with C. [his wife]. _March 14th_ (_Sunday_).--Communion (St.\r\n     James's), St. Margaret's afternoon. Wrote on Ephes. v. 1, and read\r\n     it aloud to servants. _March 20th._--City to see Freshfield.\r\n     Afternoon service in Saint Paul's. What an image, what a crowd of\r\n     images! Amidst the unceasing din, and the tumult of men hurrying\r\n     this way and that for gold, or pleasure, or some self-desire, the\r\n     vast fabric thrusts itself up to heaven and firmly plants itself on\r\n     soil begrudged to an occupant that yields no lucre. But the city\r\n     cannot thrust forth its cathedral; and from thence arises the\r\n     harmonious measured voice of intercession from day to day. The\r\n     church praying and deprecating continually for the living mass that\r\n     are dead while they live, from out of the very centre of that\r\n     mass; silent and lonesome is her shrine, amidst the noise, the\r\n     thunder of multitudes. Silent, lonesome, motionless, yet full of\r\n     life; for were we not more dead than the stones, which built into\r\n     that sublime structure witness continually to what is great and\r\n     everlasting,--did priest or chorister, or the casual worshipper but\r\n     apprehend the grandeur of his function in that spot,--the very\r\n     heart must burst with the tide of emotions gathering within it. Oh\r\n     for speed, speed to the wings of that day when this glorious\r\n     unfulfilled outline of a church shall be charged as a hive with the\r\n     operations of the Spirit of God and of His war against the world;\r\n     when the intervals of space and time within its walls, now\r\n     untenanted by any functions of that holy work, shall be thickly\r\n     occupied; and when the glorious sights and sounds which shall\r\n     arrest the passenger in his haste that he may sanctify his purposes\r\n     by worship, shall be symbols still failing to express the fulness\r\n     of the power of God developed among His people.\r\n\r\n     _March 21._--Wrote on 1 Thess. v. 17, and read it to servants. Read\r\n     _The Young Communicants_; Bishop Hall's _Life_. It seems as if at\r\n     this time the number and close succession of occupations without\r\n     any great present reward of love or joy, and chiefly belonging to\r\n     an earthly and narrow range, were my special trial and discipline.\r\n     Other I seem hardly to have any of daily pressure. Health in myself\r\n     and those nearest me; (comparative) wealth and success; no strokes\r\n     from God; no opportunity of pardoning others, for none offend me.\r\n\r\n     _April 3._--Two or three nights ago Mrs. Wilbraham told Catherine\r\n     that Stanley was extremely surprised to find, after his speech on\r\n     the Tarmworth and Rugby railway bill, that Peel had been very much\r\n     annoyed with the expression he had used: 'that his right hon.\r\n     friend had in pleading for the bill made use of all that art and\r\n     ingenuity with which he so well knew how to dress up a statement\r\n     for that House,' and that he showed his annoyance very much by his\r\n     manner to him, S., afterwards. He, upon reflecting that this was\r\n     the probable cause, wrote a note to Peel to set matters to rights,\r\n     in which he succeeded; but he thought Peel very thin-skinned. Wm.\r\n     Cowper told me the other day at Milnes's that Lord John Russell is\r\n     remarkable among his colleagues for his anxiety during the recess\r\n     for the renewal of the session of parliament; that he always argues\r\n     for fixing an early day of meeting, and finds pleas for it, and\r\n     finds the time long until it recommences.\r\n\r\nA visit to Nuneham (April 12) and thence to Oxford brought him into the\r\ncentre of the tractarians. He saw much of Hamilton, went to afternoon\r\nservice at Littlemore, breakfasted in company with Newman at Merton, had\r\na long conversation with Pusey on Tract 90, and gathered that Newman\r\nthought differently of the Council of Trent from what he had thought a\r\nyear or two back, and that he differed from Pusey in thinking the\r\nEnglish reformation uncatholic. Mr. Gladstone replied that No. 90 had\r\nthe appearance to his mind of being written by a man, if in, not of, the\r\nchurch of England; and would be interpreted as exhibiting the Tridentine\r\nsystem for the ideal, the anglican for a mutilated and _just_ tolerable\r\nactual. Then in the same month he 'finished Palmer on the Articles,\r\ndeep, earnest, and generally trustworthy. Worked upon a notion of\r\nprivate eucharistical devotions, to be chiefly compiled; and attended a\r\nmeeting about colonial bishoprics,' where he spoke but indifferently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                            NEW FISCAL POLICY\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the whigs in the expiring hours of their reign launched\r\nparliament and parties upon what was to be the grand marking controversy\r\nof the era. To remedy the disorder into which expenditure, mainly due to\r\nhighhanded foreign policy, had brought the national finance, they\r\nproposed to reconstruct the fiscal system by reducing the duties on\r\nforeign sugar and timber, and substituting for Wellington's corn law a\r\nfixed eight shilling duty on imported wheat. The wiser heads, like Lord\r\nSpencer, were aware that as an electioneering expedient the new policy\r\nwould bring them little luck, but their position in any case was\r\ndesperate. The handling of their proposals was curiously maladroit; and\r\neven if it had been otherwise, ministerial repute alike for competency\r\nand for sincerity was so damaged both, in the House of Commons and the\r\ncountry, that their doom was certain. The reduction of the duty on\r\nslave-grown sugar from foreign countries was as obnoxious to the\r\nabolitionist as it was disadvantageous to the West Indian proprietors,\r\nand both of these powerful sections were joined by the corn-grower, well\r\naware that his turn would come next. Many meetings took place at Sir\r\nRobert Peel's upon the sugar resolutions, and Mr. Gladstone worked up\r\nthe papers and figures so as to be ready to speak if necessary. At one\r\nof these meetings, by the way, he thought it worth while to write down\r\nthat Peel had the tradesmen's household books upon his desk--a\r\ncircumstance that he mentioned also to the present writer, when by\r\nchance we found ourselves together in the same room fifty years later.\r\n\r\nOn May 10th, his speech on the sugar duties came off in due course. In\r\nthis speech he took the sound point that the new arrangement must act as\r\nan encouragement to the slave trade, 'that monster which, while war,\r\npestilence, and famine were slaying their thousands, slew from year to\r\nyear with unceasing operation its tens of thousands.' As he went on, he\r\nfell upon Macaulay for being member of a cabinet that was thus deserting\r\na cause in which Macaulay's father had been the unseen ally of\r\nWilberforce, and the pillar of his strength,--'a man of profound\r\nbenevolence, of acute understanding, of indefatigable industry, and of\r\nthat self-denying temper which is content to work in secret, and to seek\r\nfor its reward beyond the grave.' Macaulay was the last man to suffer\r\nrebuke in silence, and he made a sharp reply on the following day,\r\nfollowed by a magnanimous peace-making behind the Speaker's chair.\r\n\r\n                     DEFEAT OF WHIG MINISTRY\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the air was thick and loud with rumours. Lord Eliot told Mr.\r\nGladstone in the middle of the debate that there had been a stormy\r\ncabinet that morning, and that ministers had at last made up their minds\r\nto follow Lord Spencer's advice, to resign and not to dissolve. When the\r\ndivision on the sugar duties was taken, ministers were beaten (May 19)\r\nby a majority of 36, after fine performances from Sir Robert, and a good\r\none from Palmerston on the other side. The cabinet, with, a tenacity\r\nincredible in our own day, were still for holding on until their whole\r\nscheme, with the popular element of cheap bread in it, was fully before\r\nthe country. Peel immediately countered them by a vote of want of\r\nconfidence, and this was carried (June 4) by a majority of one:--\r\n\r\n     On Saturday morning the division in the House of Commons presented\r\n     a scene of the most extraordinary excitement. While we were in our\r\n     lobby we were told that we were 312 and the government either 311\r\n     or 312. It was also known that they had brought down Lord ---- who\r\n     was reported to be in a state of total idiocy. After returning to\r\n     the House I went to sit near the bar, where the other party were\r\n     coming in. We had all been counted, 312, and the tellers at the\r\n     government end had counted to 308; there remained behind this\r\n     unfortunate man, reclining in a chair, evidently in total\r\n     unconsciousness of what was proceeding. Loud cries had been raised\r\n     from our own side, when it was seen that he was being brought up,\r\n     to clear the bar that the whole House might witness the scene, and\r\n     every one stood up in intense curiosity. There were now only this\r\n     figure, less human even than an automaton, and two persons, R.\r\n     Stuart and E. Ellice, pushing the chair in which he lay. A loud cry\r\n     of 'Shame, Shame,' burst from our side; those opposite were silent.\r\n     Those three were counted without passing the tellers, and the\r\n     moment after we saw that our tellers were on the right in walking\r\n     to the table, indicating that we had won. Fremantle gave out the\r\n     numbers, and then the intense excitement raised by the sight we had\r\n     witnessed found vent in our enthusiastic (quite irregular) hurrah\r\n     with great waving of hats. Upon looking back I am sorry to think\r\n     how much I partook in the excitement that prevailed; but how could\r\n     it be otherwise in so extraordinary a case? I thought Lord John's a\r\n     great speech--it was delivered too under the pressure of great\r\n     indisposition. He has risen with adversity. He seemed rather below\r\n     par as a leader in 1835 when he had a clear majority, and the ball\r\n     nearly at his foot; in each successive year the strength of his\r\n     government has sunk and his own has risen.\r\n\r\nThen came the dissolution, and an election memorable in the history of\r\nparty. Thinking quite as much of the Scotch college, the colonial\r\nbishoprics, and Tract Ninety, as of sugar duties or the corn law, Mr.\r\nGladstone hastened to Newark. He was delighted with the new colleague\r\nwho had been provided for him. 'As a candidate,' he writes to his wife,\r\n'Lord John Manners is excellent; his speaking is popular and effective,\r\nand he is a good canvasser, by virtue not I think of effort, but of a\r\ngeneral kindliness and warmth of disposition which naturally shows\r\nitself to every one. Nothing can be more satisfactory than to have such\r\na partner.' In his address Mr. Gladstone only touched on the poor law\r\nand the corn law. On the first he would desire liberal treatment for\r\naged, sick, and widowed poor, and reasonable discretion to the local\r\nadministrators of the law. As to the second, the protection of native\r\nagriculture is an object of the first economical and national\r\nimportance, and should be secured by a graduated scale of duties on\r\nforeign grain. 'Manners and I,' he says, 'were returned as\r\nprotectionists. My speeches were of absolute dulness, but I have no\r\ndoubt they were sound in the sense of my leaders Peel and Graham and\r\nothers of the party.' The election offered no new incidents. One old\r\nlady reproached him for not being content with keeping bread and sugar\r\nfrom the people, but likewise by a new faith, the mysterious monster of\r\nPuseyism, stealing away from them the bread of life. He found the\r\nwesleyans shaky, partly because they disliked his book and were afraid\r\nof the Oxford Tracts, and partly from his refusal to subscribe to their\r\nschool. Otherwise, flags, bands, suppers, processions, all went on in\r\nhigh ceremonial order as before. Day after day passed with nothing worse\r\nthan the threat of a blue candidate, but one Sunday morning (June 26) as\r\npeople came out of church, they found an address on the walls and a dark\r\nrumour got afloat that the new man had brought heavy bags of money. For\r\nthis rumour there was no foundation, but it inspired annoying fears in\r\nthe good and cheerful hopes in the bad. The time was in any case too\r\nshort, and at four o'clock on June 29 the poll was found to be,\r\nGladstone 633, Manners 630, Hobhouse 391. His own election safely over,\r\nMr. Gladstone turned to take part in a fierce contest in which Sir\r\nStephen Glynne was candidate for the representation of Flintshire, but\r\n'bribery, faggotry, abduction, personation, riot, factious delays,\r\nlandlord's intimidations, partiality of authorities,' carried the day,\r\nand to the bitter dismay of Hawarden, Sir Stephen was narrowly beaten.\r\nOne ancient dame, overwhelmed by the defeat of the family that for\r\neighty years she had idolised, cried aloud to Mrs. Gladstone, 'I am a\r\ngreat woman for thinking of the Lord, but O, my dear lady, this has put\r\nit all out of my head.' The election involved him in what would now be\r\nthought a whimsical correspondence with one of the Grosvenor family, who\r\ncomplained of Mr. Gladstone for violating the sacred canons of\r\nelectioneering etiquette by canvassing Lord Westminster's tenants. 'I\r\ndid think,' says the wounded patrician, 'that interference between a\r\nlandlord with whose opinions you were acquainted and his tenants was not\r\njustifiable according to those laws of delicacy and propriety which I\r\nconsidered binding in such cases.'\r\n\r\n                          ELECTION OF 1841\r\n\r\nAt last he was able to snatch a holiday with his wife and child by the\r\nseaside at Hoylake, which rather oddly struck him as being like Paestum\r\nwithout the temples. He read away at Gibbon and Dante until he went to\r\nHawarden, partly to consider the state of its financial affairs; as to\r\nthese something is to be said later. 'Walked alone in the Hawarden\r\ngrounds,' he says one day during his stay; 'ruminated on the last-named\r\nsubject [accounts], also on anticipated changes [in government]. I can\r\ndigest the crippled religious action of the state; but I cannot be a\r\nparty to exacting by blood opium compensation from the Chinese.' Then to\r\nLondon (Aug. 18). He attended the select party meetings at Sir Robert\r\nPeel's and Lord Aberdeen's. Dining at Grillion's he heard Stanley,\r\nspeaking of the new parliament, express a high opinion of Roebuck as an\r\nable man and clear speaker, likely to make a figure; and also of Cobden\r\nas a resolute perspicacious man, familiar with all the turns of his\r\nsubject; and when the new House assembled, he had made up his mind for\r\nhimself that '_Cobden will be a worrying man on corn_.' This was\r\nCobden's first entry into the House. At last the whigs were put out of\r\noffice by a majority of 91, and Peel undertook to form a government.\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 31/41._--In consequence of a note received this morning from\r\n     Sir Robert Peel I went to him at half-past eleven. The following is\r\n     the substance of a quarter of an hour's conversation. He said: 'In\r\n     this great struggle, in which we have been and are to be engaged,\r\n     the chief importance will attach to questions of finance. It would\r\n     not be in my power to undertake the business of chancellor of the\r\n     exchequer in detail; I therefore have asked Goulburn to fill that\r\n     office, and I shall be simply first lord. I think we shall be very\r\n     strong in the House of Commons if as a part of this arrangement you\r\n     will accept the post of vice-president of the board of trade, and\r\n     conduct the business of that department in the House of Commons,\r\n     with Lord Ripon as president. I consider it an office of the\r\n     highest importance, and you will have my unbounded confidence in\r\n     it.'[146]\r\n\r\n     I said, 'of the importance and responsibility of that office at the\r\n     present time I am well aware; but it is right that I should say as\r\n     strongly as I can, that I really am not fit for it. I have no\r\n     general knowledge of trade whatever; with a few questions I am\r\n     acquainted, but they are such as have come across me incidentally.'\r\n     He said, 'The satisfactory conduct of an office of that kind must\r\n     after all depend more upon the intrinsic qualities of the man, than\r\n     upon the precise amount of his previous knowledge. I also think you\r\n     will find Lord Ripon a perfect master of these subjects, and depend\r\n     upon it with these appointments at the board of trade we shall\r\n     carry the whole commercial interests of the country with us.'\r\n\r\n                 VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE\r\n\r\n     He resumed, 'If there be any other arrangement that you would\r\n     prefer, my value and \"affectionate regard\" for you would make me\r\n     most desirous to effect it so far as the claims of others would\r\n     permit. To be perfectly frank and unreserved, I should tell you,\r\n     that there are many reasons which would have made me wish to send\r\n     you to Ireland; but upon the whole I think that had better not be\r\n     done. Some considerations connected with the presbyterians of\r\n     Ireland make me prefer on the whole that we should adopt a\r\n     different plan.[147] Then, if I had had the exchequer, I should\r\n     have asked you to be financial secretary to the treasury; but under\r\n     the circumstances I have mentioned, that would be an office of\r\n     secondary importance and I am sure you will not estimate that I now\r\n     propose to you by the mere name which it bears.' He also made an\r\n     allusion to the admiralty of which I do not retain the exact form.\r\n     But I rather interposed and said, 'My objection on the score of\r\n     fitness would certainly apply with even increased force to anything\r\n     connected with the military and naval services of the country, for\r\n     of them I know nothing. Nor have I any other object in view; there\r\n     is no office to which I could designate myself. I think it my duty\r\n     to act upon your judgment as to my qualifications. If it be your\r\n     deliberate wish to make me vice-president of the board of trade, I\r\n     will not decline it; I will endeavour to put myself into harness,\r\n     and to prepare myself for the place in the best manner I can; but\r\n     it really is an apprenticeship.' He said, 'I hope you will be\r\n     content to act upon the sense which others entertain of your\r\n     suitableness for this office in particular, and I think it will be\r\n     a good arrangement both with a view to the present conduct of\r\n     business and to the brilliant destinies which I trust are in store\r\n     for you.' I answered, that I was deeply grateful for his many acts\r\n     of confidence and kindness; and that I would at once assent to the\r\n     plan he had proposed, only begging him to observe that I had\r\n     mentioned my unfitness under a very strong sense of duty and of the\r\n     facts, and not by any means as a mere matter of ceremony. I then\r\n     added that I thought I should but ill respond to his confidence if\r\n     I did not mention to him a subject connected with his policy which\r\n     might raise a difficulty in my mind. 'I cannot,' I said,\r\n     'reconcile it to my sense of right to exact from China, as a term\r\n     of peace, compensation for the opium surrendered to her.'... He\r\n     agreed that it was best to mention it; observed that in consequence\r\n     of the shape in which the Chinese affair came into the hands of the\r\n     new government, they would not be wholly unfettered; seemed to hint\r\n     that under any other circumstances the vice-president of board of\r\n     trade need not so much mind what was done in the other departments,\r\n     but remarked that at present every question of foreign relations\r\n     and many more would be very apt to mix themselves with the\r\n     department of trade. He thought I had better leave the question\r\n     suspended.\r\n\r\n     I hesitated a moment before coming away and said it was only from\r\n     my anxiety to review what I had said, and to be sure that I had\r\n     made a clean breast on the subject of my unfitness for the\r\n     department of trade. Nothing could be more friendly and warm than\r\n     his whole language and demeanour. It has always been my hope, that\r\n     I might be able to avoid this class of public employment. On this\r\n     account I have not endeavoured to train myself for them. The place\r\n     is very distasteful to me, and what is of more importance, I fear I\r\n     may hereafter demonstrate the unfitness I have to-day only stated.\r\n     However, it comes to me, I think, as a matter of plain duty; it may\r\n     be all the better for not being according to my own bent and\r\n     leaning; I must forthwith go to work, as a reluctant schoolboy\r\n     meaning well.\r\n\r\n     _Sept. 3._--This day I went to Claremont to be sworn in. When the\r\n     council was constructed, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Liverpool\r\n     were first called in to take their oaths and seats; then the\r\n     remaining four followed, Lincoln, Eliot, Ernest Bruce, and I. The\r\n     Queen sat at the head of the table, composed but dejected--one\r\n     could not but feel for her, all through the ceremonial. We knelt\r\n     down to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and stood up to\r\n     take (I think) the councillor's oath, then kissed the Queen's hand,\r\n     then went round the table shaking hands with each member, beginning\r\n     from Prince Albert who sat on the Queen's right, and ending with\r\n     Lord Wharncliffe on her left. We then sat at the lower end of the\r\n     table, excepting Lord E. Bruce, who went to his place behind the\r\n     Queen as vice-chamberlain. Then the chancellor first and next the\r\n     Duke of Buckingham were sworn to their respective offices. C.\r\n     Greville forgot the duke's privy seal and sent him off without it;\r\n     the Queen corrected him and gave it.... Then were read and approved\r\n     several orders in council; among which was one assigning a district\r\n     to a church and another appointing Lord Ripon and me to act in\r\n     matters of trade. These were read aloud by the Queen in a very\r\n     clear though subdued voice; and she repeated 'Approved' after each.\r\n     Upon that relating to Lord R. and myself we were called up and\r\n     kissed hands again. Then the Queen rose, as did all the members of\r\n     the council, and retired bowing. We had luncheon in the same room\r\n     half an hour later and went off. The Duke of Wellington went in an\r\n     open carriage with a pair; all our other grand people with four.\r\n     Peel looked shy all through. I visited Claremont once before, 27\r\n     years ago I think, as a child, to see the place, soon after the\r\n     Princess Charlotte's death. It corresponded pretty much with my\r\n     impressions.\r\n\r\n                       SWORN OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\r\n\r\nHe secured his re-election at Newark on September 14 without opposition,\r\nand without trouble, beyond the pressure of a notion rooted in the\r\ngenial mind of his constituency that as master of the mint he would have\r\nan unlimited command of public coin for all purposes whether general or\r\nparticular. His reflections upon his ministerial position are of much\r\nbiographic interest. He had evidently expected inclusion in the\r\ncabinet:--\r\n\r\n     _Sept. 16._--Upon quietly reviewing past times, and the degree of\r\n     confidence which Sir Robert Peel had for years, habitually I may\r\n     say, reposed in me, and especially considering its climax, in my\r\n     being summoned to the meetings immediately preceding the debate on\r\n     the address in August, I am inclined to think, after allowing for\r\n     the delusions of self love, that there is not a perfect\r\n     correspondence between the tenor of the past on the one hand, and\r\n     my present appointment and the relations in which it places me to\r\n     the administration on the other. He may have made up his mind at\r\n     those meetings that I was not qualified for the consultations of a\r\n     government, nor would there be anything strange in this, except the\r\n     supposition that he had not seen it before. Having however taken\r\n     the alarm (so to speak) upon the invitation at that time, and been\r\n     impressed with the idea that it savoured of cabinet office, I\r\n     considered and consulted on the Chinese question, which I regarded\r\n     as a serious impediment to office of that description, and I had\r\n     provisionally contemplated saying to Peel in case he should offer\r\n     me Ireland with the cabinet, to reply that I would gladly serve his\r\n     government in the secretaryship, but that I feared his Chinese\r\n     measures would hardly admit of my acting in the cabinet. I am very\r\n     sorry now to think that I may have been guilty of an altogether\r\n     absurd presumption, in dreaming of the cabinet. But it was wholly\r\n     suggested by that invitation. And I still think that there must\r\n     have been some consultation and decision relating to me in the\r\n     interval between the meetings and the formation of the new\r\n     ministry, which produced some alteration.... In confirmation of the\r\n     notion I have recorded above, I am distinct in the recollection\r\n     that there was a shyness in Peel's manner and a downward eye, when\r\n     he opened the conversation and made the offer, not usual with him\r\n     in speaking to me.\r\n\r\nIn after years, he thus described his position when he went to the board\r\nof trade:--\r\n\r\n     I was totally ignorant both of political economy and of the\r\n     commerce of the country. I might have said, as I believe was said\r\n     by a former holder of the vice-presidency, that my mind was in\r\n     regard to all those matters a 'sheet of white paper,' except that\r\n     it was doubtless coloured by a traditional prejudice of protection,\r\n     which had then quite recently become a distinctive mark of\r\n     conservatism. In a spirit of ignorant mortification I said to\r\n     myself at the moment: the science of politics deals with the\r\n     government of men, but I am set to govern packages. In my journal\r\n     for Aug. 2 I find this recorded: 'Since the address meetings'\r\n     (which were quasi-cabinets) 'the idea of the Irish secretaryship\r\n     had nestled imperceptibly in my mind.'[148]\r\n\r\nThe vice-presidency was the post, by the way, impudently proposed four\r\nyears later by the whigs to Gobden, after he had taught both whigs and\r\ntories their business. Mr. Gladstone, at least, was quick to learn the\r\nshare of 'packages' in the government of men.\r\n\r\n                      REFLECTIONS ON HIS OFFICE\r\n\r\n     _Sept. 30._--Closing the month, and a period of two years\r\n     comprehended within this book, I add a few words. My position is\r\n     changed by office. In opposition I was frequently called, or\r\n     sometimes at least, to the confidential councils of the party on a\r\n     variety of subjects. In office, I shall of course have to do with\r\n     the department of trade and with little or nothing beyond. There is\r\n     some point in the query of the _Westminster Review: Whether my\r\n     appointments are a covet satire?_ But they bring great advantages;\r\n     much less responsibility, much less anxiety. I could not have made\r\n     myself answerable for what I expect the cabinet will do in China.\r\n     It must be admitted that it presents an odd appearance, when a\r\n     person whose mind and efforts have chiefly ranged within the circle\r\n     of subjects connected with the church, is put into office of the\r\n     most different description. It looks as if the first object were to\r\n     neutralise his mischievous tendencies. But I am in doubt whether to\r\n     entertain this supposition would be really a compliment to the\r\n     discernment of my superiors, or a breach of charity; therefore it\r\n     is best not entertained.\r\n\r\nParagraphs appeared in newspapers imputing to Mr. Gladstone a strong\r\nreprobation of the prime minister's opinions upon church affairs, and he\r\nthought it worth while to write to Sir Robert a strong (and most\r\nexcessively lengthy) disclaimer of being, among other things, an object\r\nof hope to unbending tories as against their moderate and cautious\r\nleader.[149] 'Should party spirit,' he went on, 'run very high against\r\nyour commercial measures, I have no doubt that the venom of my religious\r\nopinions will be plentifully alleged to have infused itself into your\r\npolicy even in that direction, ... and more than ever will be heard of\r\nyour culpability in taking into office a person of my bigoted and\r\nextreme sentiments.' Peel replied (October 19, 1841) with kindness and\r\ngood sense. He had not taken the trouble to read the paragraph; he had\r\nread the works from which a mischievous industry had tried to collect\r\nmeans of defaming their author; he found nothing in them in the most\r\ndistant manner to affect political co-operation; and he signed his name\r\nto the letter, 'with an esteem and regard, which are proof against\r\nevil-minded attempts to sow jealousy and discord.'[150]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137] For Mr. Gladstone's later view of this transaction, see\r\n_Gleanings_, i. p. 39. He composed a letter on the subject, which, he\r\nsays, 'will probably never see the light.'\r\n\r\n[138] Mr. Gladstone compiled this list of the statesmen in the maternal\r\nancestry of his children:--\r\n\r\n  Right Hon. George Grenville,       Great, great grandfather.\r\n  Sir W. Wyndham,                    Great, great, great grandfather.\r\n  Lord Chatham,                      Great, great granduncle-in-law.\r\n  Mr. Pitt,                          First cousin thrice removed.\r\n  Lord Grenville,                    Great granduncle.\r\n  Mr. Grenville,                     Great granduncle.\r\n\r\n[139] _Paradiso_, xxvi. 64-6--\r\n\r\n  'Love for each plant that in the garden grows,\r\n          Of the Eternal Gardener, I prove,\r\n   Proportioned to the goodness he bestows.'--WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n[140] _Ibid._ iii. 85.

In 1856 he purchased 11 Carlton House Terrace,\r\nwhich was his London home until 1875. From 1876 to 1880 he occupied 73\r\nHarley Street.\r\n\r\n[146] 'At that period the board of trade was the department which\r\nadministered to a great extent the functions that have since passed\r\nprincipally into the hands of the treasury, connected with the fiscal\r\nlaws of the country.'--_Mr. Gladstone at Leeds_, Oct. 8, 1881. In 1880,\r\nwriting to Mr. Chamberlain, then president, he says: 'If you were to\r\nlook back to the records of your department thirty-five and forty years\r\nago, you would find how much of the public trade business was transacted\r\nin it. Revenue was then largely involved: and hence, I imagine, it came\r\nabout that this business was taken over in a great degree by the\r\ntreasury. I myself have drawn up new tariffs in both, at the B. of T. in\r\n1842 and 1844-5, and at the treasury in 1853 and 1860. Why and how the\r\nold B. of T. functions also passed in part to the F.O. I do not so well\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n[147] I suppose this points to incompatibility in the fevers of the hour\r\nbetween protestant Ulster and a Puseyite chief secretary.\r\n\r\n[148] Autobiographic note.\r\n\r\n[149] It would appear from the manuscript at the British Museum, that\r\nMacaulay's sentence about Mr. Gladstone as the rising hope of the stern\r\nand unbending tories, which later events made long so famous and so\r\ntiresome, was a happy afterthought, written in along the margin.\r\n\r\n[150] Parker's _Peel_, ii. pp. 514-17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                          PEEL'S GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n                             (_1842-1844_)\r\n\r\n     In many of the most important rules of public policy Sir R. Peel's\r\n     government surpassed generally the governments which have succeeded\r\n     it, whether liberal or conservative. Among them I would mention\r\n     purity in patronage, financial strictness, loyal adherence to the\r\n     principle of public economy, jealous regard to the rights of\r\n     parliament, a single eye to the public interest, strong aversion to\r\n     extension of territorial responsibilities and a frank admission of\r\n     the rights of foreign countries as equal to those of their\r\n     own.--MR. GLADSTONE (1880).[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four or five most memorable administrations of the century, the\r\ngreat conservative government of Sir Robert Peel was undoubtedly one. It\r\nlaid the groundwork of our solid commercial policy, it established our\r\nrailway system, it settled the currency, and, by no means least, it gave\r\nus a good national character in Europe as lovers of moderation, equity,\r\nand peace. Little as most members of the new cabinet saw it, their\r\nadvent definitely marked the rising dawn of an economic era. If you had\r\nto constitute new societies, Peel said to Croker, then you might on\r\nmoral and social grounds prefer cornfields to cotton factories, and you\r\nmight like an agricultural population better than a manufacturing; as it\r\nwas, the national lot was cast, and statesmen were powerless to turn\r\nback the tide. The food of the people, their clothing, the raw material\r\nfor their industry, their education, the conditions under which women\r\nand children were suffered to toil, markets for the products of loom and\r\nforge and furnace and mechanic's shop,--these were slowly making their\r\nway into the central field of political vision, and taking the place of\r\nfantastic follies about foreign dynasties and the balance of power as\r\nthe true business of the British statesman. On the eve of entering\r\nparliament (September 17, 1832), Mr. Gladstone recounts some articles of\r\nhis creed at the time to his friend Gaskell, and to modern eyes a\r\ncurious list it is. The first place is given to his views on the\r\nrelative merits of Pedro, Miguel, Donna Maria, in respect of the throne\r\nof Portugal. The second goes to Poland. The third to the affairs of\r\nLombardy. Free trade comes last. This was still the lingering fashion of\r\nthe moment, and it died hard.\r\n\r\nThe new ministry contained an unusual number of men of mark and\r\ncapacity, and they were destined to form a striking group. At their head\r\nwas a statesman whose fame grows more impressive with time, not the\r\nauthor or inspirer of large creative ideas, but with what is at any rate\r\nnext best--a mind open and accessible to those ideas, and endowed with\r\nsuch gifts of skill, vigilance, caution, and courage as were needed for\r\nthe government of a community rapidly passing into a new stage of its\r\nsocial growth. One day in February 1842, he sent for Mr. Gladstone on\r\nsome occasion of business. Peel happened not to be well, and in the\r\ncourse of the conversation his doctor called. Sir James Graham who had\r\ncome in, said to his junior in Peel's absence with the physician, 'The\r\npressure upon him is immense. We never had a minister who was so truly a\r\nfirst minister as he is. He makes himself felt in every department, and\r\nis really cognisant of the affairs of each. Lord Grey could not master\r\nsuch an amount of business. Canning could not do it. Now he is an actual\r\nminister, and is indeed _capax imperii_.' Next to Peel as parliamentary\r\nleaders stood Graham himself and Stanley. They had both of them sat in\r\nthe cabinet of Lord Grey, and now found themselves the colleagues of the\r\nbitterest foes of Grey's administration. As we have seen, Mr. Gladstone\r\npronounces Graham to have known more about economic subjects than all\r\nthe rest of the government put together. Such things had hitherto been\r\nleft to men below the first rank in the hierarchy of public office, like\r\nHuskisson. Pedro and Miguel held the field.\r\n\r\n                     END OF HIS PROTECTIONIST STAGE\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's own position is described in an autobiographic fragment\r\nof his last years:--\r\n\r\n     When I entered parliament in 1832, the great controversy between\r\n     protection or artificial restraint and free trade, of which Cobden\r\n     was the leading figure, did not enter into the popular\r\n     controversies of the day, and was still in the hands of the\r\n     philosophers. My father was an active and effective local\r\n     politician, and the protectionism which I inherited from him and\r\n     from all my youthful associations was qualified by a thorough\r\n     acceptance of the important preliminary measures of Mr. Huskisson,\r\n     of whom he was the first among the local supporters. Moreover, for\r\n     the first six years or so of my parliamentary life free trade was\r\n     in no way a party question, and it only became strictly such in\r\n     1841 at, and somewhat before, the general election, when the whig\r\n     government, _in extremis_, proposed a fixed duty upon corn. My mind\r\n     was in regard to it a sheet of white paper, but I accepted the\r\n     established conditions in _the lump_, and could hardly do\r\n     otherwise. In 1833 only, the question was debated in the House of\r\n     Commons, and the speech of the mover against the corn laws made me\r\n     uncomfortable. But the reply of Sir James Graham restored my peace\r\n     of mind. I followed the others with a languid interest. Yet I\r\n     remember being struck with the essential unsoundness of the\r\n     argument of Mr. Villiers. It was this. Under the present corn law\r\n     our trade, on which we depend, is doomed, for our manufacturers\r\n     cannot possibly contend with the manufacturers of the continent if\r\n     they have to pay wages regulated by the protection price of food,\r\n     while their rivals pay according to the natural or free trade\r\n     price. The answer was obvious. 'Thank you. We quite understand you.\r\n     Your object is to get down the wages of your workpeople.' It was\r\n     Cobden who really set the argument on its legs; and it is futile to\r\n     compare any other man with him as the father of our system of free\r\n     trade.\r\n\r\n     I had in 1840 to dabble in this question, and on the wrong side of\r\n     it[152].... The matter passed from my mind, full of churches and\r\n     church matters, in which I was now gradually acquiring knowledge.\r\n     In 1841 the necessities of the whig government led to a further\r\n     development of the great controversy; but I interfered only in the\r\n     colonial part of it in connection with the colonies and the slave\r\n     trade to Porto Rico and Brazil. We West Indians were now great\r\n     philanthropists! When Sir Robert Peel assumed the government he had\r\n     become deeply committed to protection, which in the last two or\r\n     three years had become the subject of a commanding controversy. I\r\n     suppose that at Newark I followed suit, but I have no records. On\r\n     the change of government Peel, with much judgment, offered me the\r\n     vice-presidentship of the board of trade. On sound principles of\r\n     party discipline, I took the office at once; and having taken it I\r\n     set to work with all my might as a worker. In a very short time I\r\n     came to form a low estimate of the knowledge and information of\r\n     Lord Ripon; and of the cabinet Sir James Graham, I think, knew\r\n     most. And now the stones of which my protectionism was built up\r\n     began to get uncomfortably loose. When we came to the question of\r\n     the tariff, we were all nearly on a par in ignorance, and we had a\r\n     very bad adviser in Macgregor, secretary to the board of trade. But\r\n     I had the advantage of being able to apply myself with an undivided\r\n     attention. My assumption of office at the board of trade was\r\n     followed by hard, steady, and honest work; and every day so spent\r\n     beat like a battering ram on the unsure fabric of my official\r\n     protectionism. By the end of the year I was far gone in the\r\n     opposite sense. I had to speak much on these questions in the\r\n     session of 1842, but it was always done with great moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                         PEEL'S SLOW CONVERSION\r\n\r\nThe case on the accession of the new ministers was difficult. Peel\r\nhimself has drawn the picture. By incompetent finance, by reckless\r\ncolonial expenditure, by solving political difficulties through gifts or\r\npromises of cash from the British treasury, by war and foreign relations\r\nhovering on the verge of war and necessitating extended preparations,\r\nthe whigs had brought the national resources into an embarrassment that\r\nwas extreme. The accumulated deficits of five years had become a heavy\r\nincubus, and the deficit of 1842-3 was likely to be not less than two\r\nand a half millions more. Commerce and manufactures were languishing.\r\nDistress was terrible. Poor-rates were mounting, and grants-in-aid\r\nwould extend impoverishment from the factory districts to the rural.\r\n'Judge then,' said Peel, 'whether we can with safety retrograde in\r\nmanufactures.'[153]\r\n\r\nSo grave a crisis could only be met by daring remedies. With the highest\r\ncourage, moral courage no less than political, Peel resolved to ask\r\nparliament to let him raise four or five millions a year by income-tax,\r\nin order to lower the duties on the great articles of consumption, and\r\nby reforming the tariff both to relieve trade, and to stimulate and\r\nreplenish the reciprocal flow of export and import. That he at this\r\ntime, or perhaps in truth at any time, had acquired complete mastery of\r\nthose deeper principles and wider aspects of free trade of which Adam\r\nSmith had been the great exponent--principles afterwards enforced by the\r\ngenius of Cobden with such admirable still, persistency, and patriotic\r\nspirit--there was nothing to show. Such a scheme had no originality in\r\nit. Huskisson, and men of less conspicuous name, had ten years earlier\r\nurged the necessity of a new general system of taxation, based upon\r\nremission of duty on raw materials and on articles of consumption, and\r\nupon the imposition of an income-tax. The famous report of the committee\r\non import duties of 1840, often rightly called the charter of free\r\ntrade, and of which Peel, not much to his credit, had at this moment not\r\nread a word,[154] laid the foundations of the great policy of tariff\r\nreform with which the names of Peel and Gladstone are associated in\r\nhistory. The policy advocated in 1830 in the admirable treatise of Sir\r\nHenry Parnell is exactly the policy of Peel in 1842, as he acknowledged.\r\nAfter all it is an idle quarrel between the closet strategist and the\r\nvictorious commander; between the man who first discerns some great\r\ntruth of government, and the man who gets the thing, or even a part of\r\nthe thing, actually done.\r\n\r\n                         PEEL'S GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone has left on record some particulars of his own share as\r\nsubordinate minister not in the cabinet, in this first invasion upon\r\nthe old tory corn law of 1827. Peel from the beginning appreciated the\r\npowers of his keen and zealous lieutenant, and even in the autumn of\r\n1841 he had taken him into confidential counsel.[155] Besides a letter\r\nof observations on the general scheme of commercial freedom, Mr.\r\nGladstone prepared for the prime minister a special paper on the corn\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n     The ordinary business of the department soon fell into my hands to\r\n     transact with the secretaries, one of them Macgregor, a\r\n     loose-minded free trader, and the other Lefevre, a clear and\r\n     scientific one. In that autumn I became possessed with the desire\r\n     to relax the corn law, which formed, I believe, the chief subject\r\n     of my meditations. Hence followed an important consequence. Very\r\n     slow in acquiring relative and secondary knowledge and honestly\r\n     absorbed in my work, I simply thought on and on as to what was\r\n     right and fair under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn January 1842, as the session approached, they came to close quarters.\r\nThe details of all the mysteries of protectionist iniquity we may well\r\nspare ourselves. Peel, feeling the pulse of his agricultural folk,\r\nthought it would never do to give them less than a ten-shilling duty,\r\nwhen the price of wheat was at sixty-two shillings the quarter; while\r\nMr. Gladstone thought a twelve-shilling duty at a price of sixty far too\r\nlow a relief to the consumer. His eyes were beginning to be opened.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 2._--I placed in Sir R. Peel's hands a long paper on the corn\r\n     law in the month of November, which, on wishing to refer to it, he\r\n     could not find; and he requested me to write out afresh my argument\r\n     upon the value of a rest or dead level, and the part of the scale\r\n     of price at which it should arrive; this I did.\r\n\r\n     On Monday I wrote another paper arguing for a rest between 60/ and\r\n     70/ or thereabouts; and yesterday a third intended to show that the\r\n     present law has been in practice _fully_ equivalent to a\r\n     prohibition up to 70/. Lord Ripon then told me the cabinet had\r\n     adopted Peel's scale as it originally stood--and seemed to doubt\r\n     whether _any_ alteration could be made. On his announcing the\r\n     adoption, I said in a marked manner, '_I am very sorry for\r\n     it_'--believing that it would be virtual prohibition up to 65/ or\r\n     66/ and often beyond, to the minimum; and not being able, in spite\r\n     of all the good which the government is about to do with respect to\r\n     commerce, to make up my mind to support such a protection. I see,\r\n     from conversations with them to-day, that Lord Ripon, Peel, and\r\n     Graham, are all aware the protection is greater than is necessary.\r\n\r\n                    MR. GLADSTONE'S RAPID ADVANCE\r\n\r\nThis mood soon carried the vice-president terribly far. On Feb. 5 he met\r\nmost of the members of the cabinet at Peel's house. He argued his point\r\nthat the scale would operate as virtual protection up to seventy\r\nshillings, and in a private interview with Peel afterwards hinted at\r\nretirement. Peel declared himself so taken by surprise that he hardly\r\nknew what to say; 'he was thunderstruck;' and he told his young\r\ncolleague that 'the retirement of a person holding his office, on this\r\nquestion, immediately before his introducing it, would endanger the\r\nexistence of the administration, and that he much doubted whether in\r\nsuch a case he could bring it on.'\r\n\r\n     I fear Peel was much annoyed and displeased, for he would not give\r\n     me a word of help or of favourable supposition as to my own motives\r\n     and belief. He used nothing like an angry or unkind word, but the\r\n     negative character of the conversation had a chilling effect on my\r\n     mind. I came home sick at heart in the evening and told all to\r\n     Catherine, my lips being to every one else, as I said to Sir R.\r\n     Peel, absolutely sealed.\r\n\r\n     'He might have gained me more easily, I think,' Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\n     years afterwards, 'by a more open and supple method of\r\n     expostulation. But he was not skilful, I think, in the management\r\n     of personal or sectional dilemmas, as he showed later on with\r\n     respect to two important questions, the Factory acts and the crisis\r\n     on the sugar duties in 1844.' This sharp and unnecessary corner\r\n     safely turned, Mr. Gladstone learned the lesson how to admire a\r\n     great master overcoming a legislator's difficulties.\r\n\r\n     I have been much struck (he wrote, Feb. 26) throughout the private\r\n     discussions connected with, the new project of a corn law, by the\r\n     tenacity with which Sir Robert Peel, firstly by adhering in every\r\n     point to the old arrangements where it seemed at all possible, and\r\n     since the announcement of the plan to parliament, by steadily\r\n     resisting changes in any part of the resolutions, has narrowed the\r\n     ground and reduced in number the points of attack, and thus made\r\n     his measure practicable in the face of popular excitement and a\r\n     strong opposition. Until we were actually in the midst of the\r\n     struggle, I did not appreciate the extraordinary sagacity of his\r\n     parliamentary instinct in this particular. He said yesterday to\r\n     Lord Ripon and to me, 'Among ourselves, in this room, I have no\r\n     hesitation in saying, that if I had not had to look to other than\r\n     abstract considerations, I would have proposed a lower protection.\r\n     But it would have done no good to push the matter so far as to\r\n     drive Knatchbull out of the cabinet after the Duke of Buckingham,\r\n     nor could I hope to pass a measure with greater reductions through\r\n     the House of Lords.'\r\n\r\nWhen Lord John Russell proposed an amendment substituting an\r\neight-shilling duty for a sliding scale, Peel asked Mr. Gladstone to\r\nreply to him. 'This I did (Feb. 14, 1842),' he says, 'and with my whole\r\nheart, for I did not yet fully understand the vicious operation of the\r\nsliding scale on the corn trade, and it is hard to see how an\r\neight-shilling duty could even then have been maintained.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n                           THE NEW POLICY\r\n\r\nThe three centres of operations were the corn bill, then the bill\r\nimposing the income-tax, and finally the reform of the duties upon seven\r\nhundred and fifty out of the twelve hundred articles that swelled the\r\ntariff. The corn bill was the most delicate, the tariff the most\r\nlaborious, the income-tax the boldest, the most fraught alike with peril\r\nfor the hour and with consequences of pith and moment for the future. It\r\nis hardly possible for us to realise the general horror in which this\r\nhated impost was then enveloped. The fact of Brougham procuring the\r\ndestruction of all the public books and papers in which its odious\r\naccounts were recorded, only illustrates the intensity of the common\r\nsentiment against the dire hydra evoked by Mr. Pitt for the destruction\r\nof the regicide power of France, and sent back again to its gruesome\r\nlimbo after the ruin of Napoleon. From 1842 until 1874 the question of\r\nthe income-tax was the vexing enigma of public finance.\r\n\r\nIt was upon Mr. Gladstone that the burden of the immense achievement of\r\nthe new tariff fell, and the toil was huge. He used afterwards to say\r\nthat he had been concerned in four revisions of the tariff, in 1842,\r\n1845, 1853, and 1860, and that the first of them cost six times as much\r\ntrouble as the other three put together. He spoke one hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine times during the session. He had only once sat on a\r\ncommittee of trade, and had only once spoken on a purely trade question\r\nduring the nine years of his parliamentary life. All his habits of\r\nthought and action had been cast in a different mould. It is ordinarily\r\nassumed that he was a born financier, endowed besides with a gift of\r\nidealism and the fine training of a scholar. As matter of fact, it was\r\nthe other way; he was a man of high practical and moral imagination,\r\nwith an understanding made accurate by strength of grasp and\r\nincomparable power of rapid and concentrated apprehension, yoked to\r\nfinance only by force of circumstance--a man who would have made a\r\nshining and effective figure in whatever path of great public affairs,\r\nwhether ecclesiastical or secular, duty might have called for his\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the first measure of commercial policy in this\r\nsession should have been a measure of protection in the shape of a bill\r\nintroduced by the board of trade, imposing a duty on corn, wheat, and\r\nflour brought from the United States into Canada.[156] But this was only\r\na detail, though a singular one, in a policy that was in fact a\r\ncontinuance of the relaxation of the commercial system of the colonies\r\nwhich had been begun in 1822 and 1825 by Robinson and Huskisson. In his\r\npresent employment Mr. Gladstone was called upon to handle a mass of\r\nquestions that were both of extreme complexity in themselves, and also\r\ninvolved collision with trade interests always easily alarmed,\r\nirritated, and even exasperated. With merchants and manufacturers,\r\nimporters and exporters, brokers and bankers, with all the serried hosts\r\nof British trade, with the laws and circumstances of international\r\ncommerce, he was every day brought into close, detailed, and responsible\r\ncontact:--Whether the duty on straw bonnets should go by weight or by\r\nnumber; what was the difference between boot-fronts at six shillings per\r\ndozen pairs and a 15 per cent. duty _ad valorem_; how to distinguish the\r\nregulus of tin from mere ore, and how to fix the duty on copper ore so\r\nas not to injure the smelter; how to find an adjustment between the\r\nliquorice manufacturers of London and the liquorice growers of\r\nPontefract; what was the special case for muscatels as distinct from\r\nother raisins; whether 110 pounds of ship biscuits would be a fair\r\ndeposit for taking out of bond 100 pounds of wheat if not kiln-dried, or\r\n96 pounds if kiln-dried; whether there ought to be uniformity between\r\nhides and skins. He applies to Cornewall Lewis, then a poor-law\r\ncommissioner, not on the astronomy of the ancients or the truth of early\r\nRoman history, but to find out for a certain series of years past the\r\ncontract price of meat in workhouses. He listens to the grievances of\r\nthe lath-renders; of the coopers who complain that casks will come in\r\ntoo cheap; of the coal-whippers, and the frame-work knitters; and he\r\nexamines the hard predicament of the sawyers, who hold government\r\nanswerable both for the fatal competition of machinery and the\r\ndisplacement of wood by iron. 'These deputations,' he says, 'were\r\ninvaluable to me, for by constant close questioning I learned the nature\r\nof their trades, and armed with this admission to their interior, made\r\ncareful notes and became able to defend in debate the propositions of\r\nthe tariff and to show that the respective businesses would be carried\r\non and not ruined as they said. I have ever since said that deputations\r\nare most admirable aids for the transaction of public business, provided\r\nthe receiver of them is allowed to fix the occasion and the stage at\r\nwhich they appear.'\r\n\r\n                       PEEL TO JOHN GLADSTONE\r\n\r\nAmong the deputations of this period Mr. Gladstone always recalled one\r\nfrom Lancashire, as the occasion on which he first saw Mr. Bright:--\r\n\r\n     The deputation was received not by me but by Lord Ripon, in the\r\n     large room at the board of trade, I being present. A long line of\r\n     fifteen or twenty gentlemen occupied benches running down and at\r\n     the end of the room, and presented a formidable appearance. All\r\n     that I remember, however, is the figure of a person in black or\r\n     dark Quaker costume, seemingly the youngest of the band. Eagerly he\r\n     sat a little forward on the bench and intervened in the discussion.\r\n     I was greatly struck with him. He seemed to me rather fierce, but\r\n     very strong and very earnest. I need hardly say this was John\r\n     Bright. A year or two after he made his appearance in\r\n     parliament.[157]\r\n\r\nThe best testimony to Mr. Gladstone's share in this arduous task is\r\nsupplied in a letter written by the prime minister himself to John\r\nGladstone, and that he should have taken the trouble to write it shows,\r\nmoreover, that though Peel may have been a 'bad horse to go up to in the\r\nstable,' his reserve easily melted away in recognition of difficult duty\r\nwell done:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Sir Robert Peel to John Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _Whitehall, June 16, 1842._--You probably have heard that we have\r\n     concluded the discussions (the preliminary discussions at least) on\r\n     the subject of the tariff. I cannot resist the temptation, if it be\r\n     only for the satisfaction of my own feelings, of congratulating you\r\n     most warmly and sincerely, on the distinction which your son has\r\n     acquired, by the manner in which he has conducted himself\r\n     throughout those discussions and all others since his appointment\r\n     to office. At no time in the annals of parliament has there been\r\n     exhibited a more admirable combination of ability, extensive\r\n     knowledge, temper, and discretion. Your paternal feelings must be\r\n     gratified in the highest degree by the success which has naturally\r\n     and justly followed the intellectual exertions of your son, and you\r\n     must be supremely happy as a father in the reflection that the\r\n     capacity to make such exertions is combined in his case with such\r\n     purity of heart and integrity of conduct.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty years later in offering to a severe opponent magnanimous\r\ncongratulations in debate on his son's successful maiden speech, Mr.\r\nGladstone said he knew how refreshing to a father's heart such good\r\npromise must ever be. And in his own instance Peel's generous and\r\nconsiderate letter naturally drew from John Gladstone a worthy and\r\nfeeling response:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _John Gladstone to Sir R. Peel._\r\n\r\n     _June 17._--The receipt last evening of your kind letter of\r\n     yesterday filled my eyes with tears of gratitude to Almighty God,\r\n     for having given me a son whose conduct in the discharge of his\r\n     public duties has received the full approbation of one, who of all\r\n     men, is so well qualified to form a correct judgment of his merits.\r\n     Permit me to offer you my most sincere thanks for this truly\r\n     acceptable testimonial, which I shall carefully preserve. William\r\n     is the youngest of my four sons; in the conduct of all of them, I\r\n     have the greatest cause for thankfulness, for neither have ever\r\n     caused me a pang. He excels his brothers in talent, but not so in\r\n     soundness of principles, habits of usefulness, or integrity of\r\n     purpose. My eldest, as you are aware, has again, and in a most\r\n     satisfactory manner, got into parliament. To have the third also\r\n     again there, whilst the services of naval men, circumstanced as he\r\n     is, who seek unsuccessfully for employment, are not required, we\r\n     are desirous to effect, and wait for a favourable opportunity to\r\n     accomplish. Whenever we may succeed, I shall consider my cup to be\r\n     filled, for the second is honourably and usefully engaged as a\r\n     merchant in Liverpool, occupying the situation I held there for so\r\n     many years.\r\n\r\nIt was while they were in office that Peel wrote from Windsor to beg Mr.\r\nGladstone to sit for his portrait to Lucas, the same artist who had\r\nalready painted Graham for him. 'I shall be very glad of this addition\r\nto the gallery of the eminent men of my own time.'\r\n\r\n                         ENTRY INTO THE CABINET\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Mr. Gladstone's admission to the cabinet could not\r\nbe long deferred, and in the spring of the following year, the head of\r\nthe government made him the coveted communication:--\r\n\r\n                                           _Whitehall, May 13, 1843._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR GLADSTONE,--I have proposed to the Queen that Lord Ripon\r\n     should succeed my lamented friend and colleague, Lord Fitzgerald,\r\n     as president of the board of control. I, at the same time,\r\n     requested her Majesty's permission (and it was most readily\r\n     conceded) to propose to you the office of president of the board of\r\n     trade, with a seat in the cabinet. If it were not for the occasion\r\n     of the vacancy I should have had unmixed satisfaction in thus\r\n     availing myself of the earliest opportunity that has occurred since\r\n     the formation of the government, of giving a wider scope to your\r\n     ability to render public service, and of strengthening that\r\n     government by inviting your aid as a minister of the crown. For\r\n     myself personally, and I can answer also for every other member of\r\n     the government, the prospect of your accession to the cabinet is\r\n     very gratifying to our feelings.--Believe me, my dear Gladstone,\r\n     with sincere esteem and regard, most truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                      ROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n     At two to-day (May 13), Mr. Gladstone records, I went to Sir R.\r\n     Peel's on the subject of his letter. I began by thanking him for\r\n     the indulgent manner in which he had excused my errors, and more\r\n     than appreciated any services I might have rendered, and for the\r\n     offer he had made and the manner of it. I said that I went to the\r\n     board of trade without knowledge or relish, but had been very happy\r\n     there; found quite enough to occupy my mind, enough responsibility\r\n     for my own strength, and had no desire to move onwards, but should\r\n     be perfectly satisfied with any arrangement which he might make as\r\n     to Lord Ripon's successor. He spoke most warmly of service\r\n     received, said he could not be governed by any personal\r\n     considerations, and this which he proposed was obviously the right\r\n     arrangement. I then stated the substance of what I had put in my\r\n     memorandum, first on the opium question, to which his answer was,\r\n     that the immediate power and responsibility lay with the East India\r\n     Company; he did not express agreement with my view of the\r\n     cultivation of the drug, but said it was a minor subject as\r\n     compared with other imperial interests constantly brought under\r\n     discussion; intimated that the Duke of Wellington had surrendered\r\n     his opinion (I think) upon the boundary question; and he referred\r\n     to the change in his own views, and said that in future he\r\n     questioned whether he could undertake the defence of the corn laws\r\n     on principle. His words were addressed to a sympathising hearer. My\r\n     speeches in the House had already excited dissatisfaction if not\r\n     dismay.\r\n\r\nThen came something about the preservation of the two bishoprics in\r\nNorth Wales.[158] To Mr. Gladstone's surprise, Peel reckoned this a more\r\nserious matter, as it involved a practical course. After much had been\r\nsaid on the topic, Mr. Gladstone asked for a day or two to consider the\r\nquestion. 'I have to consider with God's help by Monday whether to enter\r\nthe cabinet or to retire altogether: at least such is probably the\r\nsecond alternative.' He wished to consult Hope and Manning, and they,\r\nupon discussion, urged that the point was too narrow on which to join\r\nissue with the government. This brought him round. 'I well remember,' he\r\nsays of this early case of compromise, 'that I pleaded against them that\r\nI should be viewed as a traitor, and they observed to me in reply that I\r\nmust be prepared for that if necessary, that (and indeed I now feel) in\r\nthese times the very wisest and most effective servants of any cause\r\nmust necessarily fall so far short of the popular sentiment of its\r\nfriends, as to be liable constantly to incur mistrust and even abuse.\r\nBut patience and the power of character overcome all these difficulties.\r\nI am certain that Hope and Manning in 1843 were not my tempters but\r\nrather my good angels.'[159]\r\n\r\nPeel had been in parliament as long, and almost as long in office, as\r\nMr. Gladstone had lived, but experience of public life enlarges the man\r\nof high mind, and Peel, while perhaps he wondered at his junior's bad\r\nsense of proportion, was the last man to laugh at force of sincerity\r\nand conscience. Men of the other sort, as he knew, were always to be had\r\nfor the asking. 'He spoke again of the satisfaction of his colleagues,\r\nand even said he did not recollect former instances of a single vacancy\r\nin a cabinet, on which there was an entire concurrence. I repeated what\r\nI had said of his and their most indulgent judgment and took occasion\r\ndistinctly to apologise for my blunder, and the consequent embarrassment\r\nwhich I caused to him in Feb. 1842, on the corn scale.'[160]\r\n\r\n                       PARLIAMENTARY SUCCESS\r\n\r\nHis parliamentary success had been extraordinary. From the first his\r\ngifts of reasoning and eloquence had pleased the House; his union of\r\nsincerity and force had attracted it as sincerity and force never fail\r\nto do; and his industry and acuteness, his steady growth in political\r\nstature, substance, and acquisition, had gained for him the confidence\r\nof the austerest of leaders. He had reached a seat in the cabinet before\r\nhe was thirty-four, and after little more than ten years of\r\nparliamentary life. Canning was thirty-seven before he won the same\r\neminence, and he had been thirteen years in the House; while Peel had\r\nthe cabinet within reach when he was four-and-thirty, and had been in\r\nthe House almost thirteen years, of which six had been passed in the\r\narduous post of Irish secretary. Mr. Gladstone had shown that he had in\r\nhim the qualities that make a minister and a speaker of the first class,\r\nthough he had shown also the perilous quality of a spirit of minute\r\nscruple. He had not yet displayed those formidable powers of contention\r\nand attack, that were before long to resemble some tremendous\r\nprojectile, describing a path the law of whose curves and deviations, as\r\nthey watched its journey through the air in wonder and anxiety for the\r\nshattering impact, men found it impossible to calculate.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's brief notes of his first and second cabinets are worth\r\ntranscribing: the judicious reader will have little difficulty in\r\nguessing the topic for deliberation; it figured in the latest of his\r\ncabinets as in the earliest, as well as in most of those that\r\nintervened. '_May 15._--My first cabinet. On Irish repeal meetings. No\r\nfear of breach of the peace, grounded on reasons. Therefore no case for\r\ninterference. (The duke, however, was for issuing a proclamation.) _May\r\n20._--Second [cabinet] Repeal. Constabulary tainted.' It would be safe to\r\nsay of any half dozen consecutive meetings of the Queen's servants,\r\ntaken at random during the reign, that Ireland would be certain to crop\r\nup. Still, protection was the burning question. From one cause or\r\nanother, said Mr. Gladstone looking back to these times, 'my reputation\r\namong the conservatives on the question of protection oozed away with\r\nrapidity. It died with the year 1842, and early in 1843 a duke, I think\r\nthe Duke of Richmond, speaking in the House of Lords, described some\r\nrenegade proceeding as a proceeding conducted under the banner of the\r\nvice-president of the board of trade.' He was not always as careful as\r\nPeel, and sometimes came near to a scrape.\r\n\r\n     In my speech, on Lord Howick's motion (Mar. 10, 1843) I was\r\n     supposed to play with the question, and prepare the way for a\r\n     departure from the corn law of last year, and I am sensible that I\r\n     so far lost my head, as not to put well together the various, and,\r\n     if taken separately, conflicting considerations which affect the\r\n     question.... It so happens that I spoke under the influence of a\r\n     new and most sincere conviction, having reference to the recent\r\n     circumstances of commercial legislation abroad, to the effect that\r\n     it would not be wise to displace British labour for the sake of\r\n     cheap corn, without the counteracting and sustaining provisions\r\n     which exchange, not distorted by tariffs all but prohibitory, would\r\n     supply.... This, it is clear, is a slippery position for a man who\r\n     does not think firmly in the midst of ambiguous and adverse\r\n     cheering, and I did my work most imperfectly, but I do think\r\n     honestly. Sir R. Peel's manner, by negative signs, showed that he\r\n     thought either my ground insecure or my expressions dangerous.\r\n\r\n                      AN ARTIFICIAL SITUATION\r\n\r\nThe situation was essentially artificial. There was little secret of the\r\nsurrender of protection as a principle. In introducing the proposals for\r\nthe reform of the customs tariff, Peel made the gentlemen around him\r\nshiver by openly declaring that on the general principle of free trade\r\nthere was no difference of opinion; that all agreed in the rule that we\r\nshould buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest; that even if\r\nthe foreigner were foolish enough not to follow suit, it was still for\r\nthe interest of this country to buy as cheap as we could, whether other\r\ncountries will buy from us or no.[161] Even important cabinet colleagues\r\nfound this too strong doctrine for them.\r\n\r\n'On Tuesday night,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'Peel opened the tariff anew,\r\nand laid down, in a manner which drew great cheering from the\r\nopposition, the doctrine of purchasing in the cheapest market. Stanley\r\nsaid to me afterwards, \"Peel laid that down a great deal too broadly.\"\r\nLast night he (Lord S.) sat down angry with himself, and turned to me\r\nand said, \"It does not signify, I _cannot_ speak on these subjects; I\r\nquite lost my head.\" I merely answered that no one but himself would\r\nhave discovered it.' Yet it was able men, apt to lose their heads in\r\neconomics, whom Peel had to carry along with him. 'On another night,'\r\nsays Mr. Gladstone, 'I thought Sir R. Peel appeared in an attitude of\r\nconspicuous intellectual greatness, and on comparing notes next day with\r\nSir J. Graham at the palace, I found he was similarly impressed. Sheil\r\ndelivered a very effective rhetorical speech. Lord Stanley had taken a\r\nfew notes and was to follow him. Sheil was winding up just as the clock\r\ntouched twelve. Lord Stanley said to Peel, \"It is twelve, shall I follow\r\nhim? I think not.\" Peel said, \"I do not think it will do to let this go\r\nunanswered.\" He had been quite without the idea of speaking that night.\r\nSheil sat down, and peals of cheering followed. Stanley seemed to\r\nhesitate a good deal, and at last said, as it were to himself, \"No, I\r\nwon't, it's too late.\" In the meantime the adjournment had been moved;\r\nbut when Peel saw there was no one in the breach, he rose. The cheers\r\nwere still, a little spitefully, prolonged from the other side. He had\r\nan immense subject, a disturbed House, a successful speech, an entire\r\nabsence of notice to contend against; but he began with power, gathered\r\npower as he went on, handled every point in his usual mode of balanced\r\nthought and language, and was evidently conscious at the close, of what\r\nno one could deny, that he had made a deep impression on the House.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone kept pretty closely in step with his leader. From Sir\r\nRobert he slowly learned lessons of circumspection that may not seem\r\ncongenial to his temperament, though for that matter we should remember\r\nall through that his temperament was double. He was of opinion, as he\r\ntold the House of Commons, that a sliding-scale, a fixed duty, and free\r\ntrade were all three open to serious objection. He regarded the defects\r\nof the existing law as greatly exaggerated, and he refused to admit that\r\nthe defects of the law, whatever they might be, were fatal to every law\r\nwith a sliding-scale. He wished to relieve the consumer, to steady the\r\ntrade, to augment foreign commerce, and the demand for labour connected\r\nwith commerce. On the other hand he desired to keep clear of the\r\ncountervailing evils of disturbing either vast capitals invested in\r\nland, or the immense masses of labour employed in agriculture.[162] He\r\nnoted with some complacency, that during the great controversy of 1846\r\nand following years, he never saw any parliamentary speech of his own\r\nquoted in proof of the inconsistency of the Peelites. Here are a couple\r\nof entries from Lord Broughton's diary for 1844:--'_June 17._ Brougham\r\nsaid \"Gladstone was a d----d fellow, a prig, and did much mischief to\r\nthe government,\" alluding to his speech about keeping sugar duties.\r\n_June 27._ Gladstone made a decided agricultural protection speech, and\r\nwas lauded therefor by Miles--so the rebels were returning to their\r\nallegiance.' Gladstone's arguments, somebody said, were in favour of\r\nfree trade, and his parentheses were in favour of protection.\r\n\r\nWell might the whole position be called as slippery a one as ever\r\noccurred in British politics. It was by the principles of free trade\r\nthat Peel and his lieutenant justified tariff-reform; and they\r\nindirectly sapped protection in general by dwelling on the mischiefs of\r\nminor forms of protection in particular. They assured the country\r\ngentlemen that the sacred principle of a scale was as tenderly cherished\r\nin the new plan as in the old; on the other hand they could assure the\r\nleaguers and the doubters that the structure of the two scales was\r\nwidely different. We cannot wonder that honest tories who stuck to the\r\nold doctrine, not always rejected even by Huskisson, that a country\r\nought not to be dependent on foreign supply, were mystified and amazed\r\nas they listened to the two rival parties disputing to which of them\r\nbelonged the credit of originating a policy that each of them had so\r\nshort a time before so scornfully denounced. The only difference was the\r\ndifference between yesterday and the day before yesterday. The whigs,\r\nwith their fixed duty, were just as open as the conservatives with their\r\nsliding-scale to the taunts of the Manchester school, when they\r\ndecorated economics by high _a priori_ declaration that the free\r\nimportation of corn was not a subject for the deliberations of the\r\nsenate, but a natural and inalienable law of the Creator. Rapid was the\r\nconversion. Even Lord Palmerston, of all people in the world, denounced\r\nthe arrogance and presumptuous folly of dealers in restrictive duties\r\n'setting up their miserable legislation instead of the great standing\r\nlaws of nature.' Mr. Disraeli, still warmly on the side of the minister,\r\nflashed upon his uneasy friends around him a reminder of the true\r\npedigree of the dogmas of free trade. Was it not Mr. Pitt who first\r\npromulgated them in 1787, who saw that the loss of the market of the\r\nAmerican colonies made it necessary by lowering duties to look round for\r\nnew markets on the continent of Europe? And was it not Fox, Burke,\r\nSheridan, and the minor whig luminaries, who opposed him, while not a\r\nsingle member of his own government in the House of Lords was willing or\r\nable to defend him? But even reminiscences of Mr. Pitt, and oracular\r\ndescriptions of Lord Shelburne as the most remarkable man of his age,\r\nbrought little comfort to men sincerely convinced with fear and\r\ntrembling that free corn would destroy rent, close their mansions and\r\ntheir parks, break up their lives, and beggar the country. They\r\nremembered also one or two chapters of history nearer to their own\r\ntime. They knew that Lord John had a right to revive the unforgotten\r\ncontrast between Peel's rejection of so-called protestant securities in\r\n1817 and 1825, and the total surrender of emancipation in 1829. Natural\r\nforebodings darkened their souls that protectionism would soon share the\r\nfate of protestantism, and that capitulation to Cobden was doomed to\r\nfollow the old scandal of capitulation to O'Connell. They felt that\r\nthere was something much more dreadful than the mere sting of a\r\nparliamentary recrimination, in the contrast between the corn bill of\r\n1842 and Peel's panegyrics in '39, '40, and '41 on the very system which\r\nthat bill now shattered. On the other side some could not forget that in\r\n1840 the whig prime minister, the head of a party still even at the\r\neleventh hour unregenerated by Manchester, predicted a violent struggle\r\nas the result of the Manchester policy, stirring society to its\r\nfoundations, kindling bitter animosities not easy to quench, and\r\ncreating convulsions as fierce as those of the Reform bill.\r\n\r\nA situation so precarious and so unedifying was sure to lead to strange\r\nresults in the relations of parties and leaders. In July 1843 the\r\nSpeaker told Hobhouse that Peel had lost all following and authority;\r\nall but votes. Hobhouse meeting a tory friend told him that Sir Robert\r\nhad got nothing but his majority. 'He won't have that long,' the tory\r\nreplied. 'Who will make sacrifices for such a fellow? They call me a\r\n_frondeur_, but there are many such. Peel thinks he can govern by\r\nFremantle and a little clique, but it will not do. The first election\r\nthat comes, out he must go.' Melbourne, only half in jest, was reported\r\nto talk of begging Peel to give him timely notice, lest the Queen might\r\ntake him by surprise. On one occasion Hobhouse wished a secondary\r\nminister to tell Sir Robert how much he admired a certain speech. 'I!'\r\nexclaimed the minister; 'he would kick me away if I dared to speak to\r\nhim.' 'A man,' Hobhouse observes, 'who will not take a civil truth from\r\na subaltern is but a sulky fellow after all; there is no true dignity or\r\npride in such reserve.' Oddly enough, Lord John was complaining just as\r\nloudly about the same time of his own want of hold upon his party.\r\n\r\nThe tariff operations of 1842 worked no swift social miracle. General\r\nstagnation still prevailed. Capital was a drug in the market, but food\r\nwas comparatively cheap.[163] Stocks were light, and there was very\r\nlittle false credit. In spite of all these favouring conditions, Mr.\r\nGladstone (March 20, 1843) had to report to his chief that 'the deadness\r\nof foreign demand keeps our commerce in a state of prolonged paralysis.'\r\nCobden had not even yet convinced them that the true way to quicken\r\nforeign demand was to open the ports to that foreign supply, with which\r\nthey paid us for what they bought from us. Mr. Gladstone saw no further\r\nthan the desire of making specific arrangement with other countries for\r\nreciprocal reductions of import duties.\r\n\r\nIn one of his autobiographic notes (1897) Mr. Gladstone describes the\r\nshort and sharp parliamentary crisis in 1844 brought about by the\r\nquestion of the sugar duties, but this may perhaps be relegated to an\r\nappendix.[164]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nFrom 1841 to 1844 Mr. Gladstone's department was engaged in other\r\nmatters lying beyond the main stream of effort. 'We were anxiously and\r\neagerly endeavouring to make tariff treaties with many foreign\r\ncountries. Austria, I think, may have been included, but I recollect\r\nespecially France, Prussia, Portugal, and I believe Spain. And the state\r\nof our tariff, even after the law of 1842, was then such as to supply us\r\nwith plenty of material for liberal offers. Notwithstanding this, we\r\nfailed in every case. I doubt whether we advanced the cause of free\r\ntrade by a single inch.'\r\n\r\nThe question of the prohibition against the export of machinery came\r\nbefore him. The custom-house authorities pronounced it ineffective, and\r\nrecommended its removal. A parliamentary committee in 1841 had reported\r\nin favour of entire freedom. The machine makers, of course, were active,\r\nand the general manufacturers of the country, excepting the Nottingham\r\nlace makers and the flax-spinners of the north of Ireland, had become\r\nneutral. Only a very limited portion of the trade was any longer subject\r\nto restriction, and Mr. Gladstone, after due consultation with superior\r\nministers, proposed a bill for removing the prohibition altogether.[165]\r\nHe also brought in a bill (April 1844) for the regulation of companies.\r\nIt was when he was president of the board of trade that the first\r\nTelegraph Act was passed. 'I was well aware,' he wrote, 'of the\r\nadvantage of taking them into the hands of the government, but I was\r\nengaged in a plan which contemplated the ultimate acquisition of the\r\nrailways by the public, and which was much opposed by the railway\r\ncompanies, so that to have attempted taking the telegraphs would have\r\nbeen hopeless. The bill was passed, but the executive machinery two\r\nyears afterwards broke down.'\r\n\r\n                               RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nQuestions that do not fall within the contentions of party usually cut a\r\nmeagre figure on the page of the historian, and the railway policy of\r\nthis decade is one of those questions. It was settled without much\r\ncareful deliberation or foresight, and may be said in the main to have\r\nshaped itself. At the time when Mr. Gladstone presided over the\r\ndepartment of trade, an immense extension of the railway system was seen\r\nto be certain, and we may now smile at what then seemed the striking\r\nnovelty of such a prospect. Mr. Gladstone proposed a select committee on\r\nthe subject, guided its deliberations, drew its reports, and framed the\r\nbill that was founded upon them. He dwelt upon the favour now beginning\r\nto be shown to the new roads by the owners of land through which they\r\nwere to pass, so different from the stubborn resistance that had for\r\nlong been offered; upon the cheapened cost of construction; upon the\r\ngrowing disposition to employ redundant capital in making railways,\r\ninstead of running the risks that had made foreign investment so\r\ndisastrous. It was not long, indeed, before this very disposition led to\r\na mania that was even more widely disastrous than any foreign investment\r\nhad been since the days of the South Sea bubble. Meanwhile, Mr.\r\nGladstone's Railway Act of 1844, besides a number of working regulations\r\nfor the day, laid down two principles of the widest range: reserving to\r\nthe state the full right of intervention in the concerns of the railway\r\ncompanies, and giving to the state the option to purchase a line at the\r\nend of a certain term at twenty-five years' purchase of the divisible\r\nprofits.[166]\r\n\r\nIt was during these years of labour under Peel that he first acquired\r\nprinciples of administrative and parliamentary practice that afterwards\r\nstood him in good stead: on no account to try to deal with a question\r\nbefore it is ripe; never to go the length of submitting a difference\r\nbetween two departments to the prime minister before the case is\r\nexhausted and complete; never to press a proposal forward beyond the\r\nparticular stage at which it has arrived. Pure commonplaces if we will,\r\nbut they are not all of them easy to learn. We cannot forget that Peel\r\nand Mr. Gladstone were in the strict line of political succession. They\r\nwere alike in social origin and academic antecedents. They started from\r\nthe same point of view as to the great organs of national life, the\r\nmonarchy, the territorial peerage and the commons, the church, the\r\nuniversities. They showed the same clear knowledge that it was not by\r\nits decorative parts, or what Burke styled 'solemn plausibilities,' that\r\nthe community derived its strength; but that it rested for its real\r\nfoundations on its manufactures, its commerce, and its credit. Even in\r\nthe lesser things, in reading Sir Robert Peel's letters, those who in\r\nlater years served under Mr. Gladstone can recognise the school to which\r\nhe went for the methods, the habits of mind, the practices of business,\r\nand even the phrases which he employed when his own time came to assume\r\nthe direction of public affairs, the surmounting of administrative\r\ndifficulties, the piloting of complex measures, and the handling of\r\ntroublesome persons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] Undated fragment of letter to the Queen.

The union of Bangor and St. Asaph had been\r\nprovided for by parliament in 1836, with a view to form a new see at\r\nManchester. The measure was passed with the general assent of the\r\nepiscopal bench and the church at large. But sentiment soon changed, and\r\na hostile cry was raised before the death of the Bishop of St. Asaph,\r\nwhen its provisions would come into force. On his death in 1846 the whig\r\nministry gave way and the sees remained separate.\r\n\r\n[159] Mr. Gladstone to Lord Lyttelton, Dec. 30, 1845.\r\n\r\n[160] See above, p. 253.\r\n\r\n[161] _Hansard_, May 10, 1842.\r\n\r\n[162] _Hansard_, February 14, 1842.\r\n\r\n[163] The average price of wheat per quarter in 1841 was 64 shillings,\r\nin 1842, 57 shillings, and in 1843, 50 shillings, a lower average than\r\nfor any year until 1849.\r\n\r\n[164] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[165] See Speech, Aug. 10, 1843.\r\n\r\n[166] Wordsworth wrote (Oct. 15,1844) to implore him to direct special\r\nattention to the desecrating project of a railway from Kendal to the\r\nhead of Windermere, and enclosed a sonnet.

The original\r\ngrant was made by the Irish parliament, protestant as it was; and was\r\naccepted even by anti-catholic leaders after 1800 as virtually a portion\r\nof the legislative union with Ireland. Peel's proposal, by making an\r\nannual grant permanent, by tripling the amount, by incorporating the\r\ntrustees, established a new and closer connection between the state and\r\nthe college. It was one of the boldest things he ever did. What Lord\r\nAberdeen wrote to Madame de Lieven in 1852 was hardly a whit less true\r\nin 1845: 'There is more intense bigotry in England at this moment than\r\nin any other country in Europe.' Peel said to Mr. Gladstone at the\r\nbeginning of 1845--'I wish to speak without any reserve, and I ought to\r\ntell you, I think it will very probably be fatal to the government.'\r\n'He explained that he did not know whether the feeling among Goulburn's\r\nconstituents [the university of Cambridge] might not be too strong for\r\nhim; that in Scotland, as he expected, there would be a great\r\nopposition; and he seemed to think that from the church also there might\r\nbe great resistance, and he said the proceedings in the diocese of\r\nExeter showed a very sensitive state of the public mind.' During the\r\nwhole of 1844 the project simmered. At a very early moment Mr. Gladstone\r\ngrew uneasy. He did not condemn the policy in itself, but whatever else\r\nmight be said, it was in direct antagonism to the principle elaborately\r\nexpounded by him only six years before, as the sacred rule and\r\nobligation between a Christian state and Christian churches. He had\r\nmarked any departure from that rule as a sign of social declension, as a\r\ndescent from a higher state of society to a lower, as a note in the ebb\r\nand flow of national life. Was it not inevitable, then, that his\r\nofficial participation in the extension of the public endowment of\r\nMaynooth would henceforth give to every one the right to say of him,\r\n'That man cannot be trusted'? He was not indeed committed, by anything\r\nthat he had written, to the extravagant position that the peace of\r\nsociety should be hazarded because it could no longer restore its\r\nancient theories of religion; but was he not right in holding it\r\nindispensable that any vote or further declaration from him on these\r\nmatters should be given under circumstances free from all just\r\nsuspicions of his disinterestedness and honesty?[167]\r\n\r\nIn view of these approaching difficulties upon Maynooth, on July 12 he\r\nmade a truly singular tender to the head of the government. He knew Peel\r\nto be disposed to entertain the question of a renewal of the public\r\nrelations with the papal court at Rome, first to be opened by indirect\r\ncommunications through the British envoy at Florence or Naples. 'What I\r\nhave to say,' Mr. Gladstone now wrote to the prime minister, 'is that if\r\nyou and Lord Aberdeen should think fit to appoint me to Florence or\r\nNaples, and to employ me in any such communications as those to which I\r\nhave referred, I am at your disposal.' Of this startling offer to\r\ntransform himself from president of the board of trade into Vatican\r\nenvoy, Mr. Gladstone left his own later judgment upon record; here it\r\nis, and no more needs to be said upon it:--\r\n\r\n     About the time of my resignation on account of the contemplated\r\n     increase of the grant to the College of Maynooth, I became\r\n     possessed with the idea that there was about to be a renewal in\r\n     some shape of our diplomatic [relations] with the see of Rome, and\r\n     I believe that I committed the gross error of tendering myself to\r\n     Sir Robert Peel to fill the post of envoy. I have difficulty at\r\n     this date (1894) in conceiving by what obliquity of view I could\r\n     have come to imagine that this was a rational or in any way\r\n     excusable proposal: and this, although I vaguely think my friend\r\n     James Hope had some hand in it, seems to show me now that there\r\n     existed in my mind a strong element of fanaticism. I believe that I\r\n     left it to Sir R. Peel to make me any answer or none as he might\r\n     think fit; and he with great propriety chose the latter\r\n     alternative.\r\n\r\n                       INTENTION TO RESIGN\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1844, the prime minister understood that if he\r\nproceeded with the Maynooth increase, he would lose Mr. Gladstone. The\r\nloss, Peel said to Graham, was serious, and on every account to be\r\nregretted, but no hope of averting it would justify the abandonment of a\r\nmost important part of their Irish policy. Meanwhile, in the midst of\r\nheavy labours on the tariff in preparation for the budget of 1845, Mr.\r\nGladstone was sharply perturbed, as some of his letters to Mrs.\r\nGladstone show:--\r\n\r\n     _Whitehall, Nov. 22, '44._--It is much beyond my expectation that\r\n     Newman should have taken my letter so kindly; it seemed to me so\r\n     like the operation of a clumsy, bungling surgeon upon a sensitive\r\n     part. I cannot well comment upon his meaning, for as you may easily\r\n     judge, what with cabinet, board, and Oak Farm, I have enough in my\r\n     head to-day--and the subject is a fine and subtle one. But I may\r\n     perhaps be able to think upon it to-night, in the meantime I think\r\n     yours is a very just conjectural sketch. We have not got in cabinet\r\n     to-day to the really pinching part of the discussion, the Roman\r\n     catholic religious education. That comes on Monday. My mind does\r\n     not waver; pray for me, that I may do right. I have an appointment\r\n     with Peel to-morrow, and I rather think he means to say something\r\n     to me on the question.\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 23._--You will see that whatever turns up, I am sure to be in\r\n     the wrong. An invitation to Windsor for us came this morning, and I\r\n     am _sorry to say_ one including Sunday--Nov. 30 to Dec. 2. I have\r\n     had a long battle with Peel on the matters of my office; not\r\n     another syllable. So far as it goes this tends to make me think he\r\n     does not calculate on any change in me; yet on the whole I lean the\r\n     other way. Manning comes up on Monday.\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 25._--Events travel fast and not slow. My opinion is that I\r\n     shall be out on Friday evening. We have discussed Maynooth to-day.\r\n     An intermediate letter which Sir James Graham has to write to\r\n     Ireland for information causes thus much of delay. I have told them\r\n     that if I go, I shall go on the ground of what is required by my\r\n     personal character, and not because my mind is _made up_ that the\r\n     course which they propose can be avoided, far less because I\r\n     consider myself bound to resist it. I had the process of this\r\n     declaration to repeat. I think they were prepared for it, but they\r\n     would not assume that it was to be, and rather proceeded as if I\r\n     had never said a word before upon the subject. It was painful, but\r\n     not so painful as the last time, and by an effort I had altogether\r\n     prevented my mind from brooding upon it beforehand. At this moment\r\n     (61/4) I am sure they are talking about it over the way. I am going\r\n     to dine with Sir R. Peel. Under these circumstances the Windsor\r\n     visit will be strange enough! In the meantime my father writes to\r\n     me most urgently, desiring me to come to Liverpool. I _hope_ for\r\n     some further light from him on Wednesday morning....\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 26._--I have no more light to throw upon the matters which I\r\n     mentioned yesterday. The dinner at Peel's went off as well as could\r\n     be expected; I did not sit near him. Lord Aberdeen was with me\r\n     to-day, and said very kindly it _must_ be prevented. But I think it\r\n     cannot, and friendly efforts to prolong the day only aggravate the\r\n     pain. Manning was with me all this morning; he is well, and is to\r\n     come back to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 9, '45._--Another postponement; but our explanations were as\r\n     satisfactory as could possibly be made under such circumstances.\r\n     The tone and manner as kind as at any time--nothing like murmur. At\r\n     the same time Peel said he thought it right to intimate a belief\r\n     that the government might very probably be shipwrecked upon the\r\n     Maynooth question, partly in connection with my retirement, but\r\n     also as he intimated from the uncertainty whether there might not\r\n     be a very strong popular feeling against it. _He_ takes upon\r\n     himself all responsibility for any inconvenience to which the\r\n     government may possibly be put from the delay and a consequent\r\n     abrupt retirement, and says I have given him the fullest and\r\n     fairest notice.... I saw Manning for two hours this morning, and\r\n     let the cat out of the bag to him in part. Have a note from\r\n     Lockhart saying the Bishop of London had sent his chaplain to\r\n     Murray to express high approval of the article on Ward--and\r\n     enclosing the vulgar addition of L63.\r\n\r\n                         AT WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n\r\n     _Windsor Castle, Jan. 10._--First, owing to the Spanish\r\n     ambassador's not appearing, Lady Lyttelton was suddenly invited,\r\n     and fell to my lot to hand in and sit by, which was very pleasant.\r\n     I am, as you know, a shockingly bad witness to looks, but she\r\n     appeared to me, I confess, a little worn and aged. She ought to\r\n     have at least two months' holiday every year. After dinner the\r\n     Queen inquired as usual about you, and rather particularly with\r\n     much interest about Lady Glynne. I told her plainly all I could.\r\n     This rather helped the Queen through the conversation, as it kept\r\n     me talking, and she was evidently hard pressed at the gaps. Then we\r\n     went to cards, and played commerce; fortunately I was never the\r\n     worst hand, and so was not called upon to pay, for I had locked up\r\n     my purse before going to dinner; but I found I had won 2s. 2d. at\r\n     the end, 8d. of which was paid me by the Prince. I mean to keep the\r\n     2d. piece (the 6d. I cannot identify) accordingly, unless I lose it\r\n     again to-night. I had rather a nice conversation with him about the\r\n     international copyright convention with Prussia....\r\n\r\n     _Whitehall, Jan. 11._--I came back from Windsor this morning, very\r\n     kindly used. The Queen mentioned particularly that you were not\r\n     asked on account of presumed inconvenience, and sent me a private\r\n     print of the Prince of Wales, and on my thanking for it through\r\n     Lady Lyttelton, another of the Princess. Also she brought the\r\n     little people through the corridor yesterday after luncheon, where\r\n     they behaved very well, and she made them come and shake hands with\r\n     me. The Prince of Wales has a very good countenance; the baby I\r\n     should call a very fine child indeed. The Queen said, After your\r\n     own you must think them dwarfs; but I answered that I did not think\r\n     the Princess Royal short as compared with Willy. We had more cards\r\n     last evening; Lady ---- made more blunders and was laughed at as\r\n     usual....\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 13._--I think there will certainly be at least one cabinet\r\n     more in the end of the week. My position is what would commonly be\r\n     called uncomfortable. I do not know how long the Maynooth matter\r\n     may be held over. I may remain a couple of months, or only a\r\n     week--may go at any time at twenty-four hours' notice. I think on\r\n     the whole it is an even chance whether I go before or after the\r\n     meeting of parliament, so that I am unfeignedly put to obey the\r\n     precept of our Lord, 'Take no thought for the morrow; the morrow\r\n     will take thought for the things of itself.' I am sorry that a part\r\n     of the inconvenience falls on your innocent head. I need not tell\r\n     you the irksomeness of business is much increased, and one's\r\n     purposes unmanned by this indefiniteness. Still, having very\r\n     important matters in preparation, I must not give any signs of\r\n     inattention or indifference.\r\n\r\n     _Cabinet Room, Jan. 14._--I have no news to give you about myself,\r\n     but continue to be quite in the dark. There is a certain Maynooth\r\n     bill in preparation, and when that appears for decision my time\r\n     will probably have come, but I am quite ignorant when it will be\r\n     forthcoming. I am to be with Peel to-morrow morning, but I think on\r\n     board of trade business only. Graham has just told us that the\r\n     draft of the Maynooth bill will be ready on Saturday; but it\r\n     cannot, I think, be _considered_ before the middle of next week at\r\n     the earliest.\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 15._--The nerves are a little unruly on a day like this\r\n     between (official) life and death; so much of feeling mixes with\r\n     the more abstract question, which would be easily disposed of if it\r\n     stood alone. (_Diary._)\r\n\r\nIt was February 3 before Mr. Gladstone wrote his last note from his desk\r\nat the board of trade, thanking the prime minister for a thousand acts\r\nof kindness which he trusted himself not readily to forget. The feeling\r\nof the occasion he described to Manning:--\r\n\r\n     Do you know that daily intercourse and co-operation with men upon\r\n     matters of great anxiety and moment interweaves much of one's being\r\n     with theirs, and parting with them, leaving them under the pressure\r\n     of their work and setting myself free, feels, I think, much like\r\n     dying: more like it than if I were turning my back altogether upon\r\n     public life. I have received great kindness, and so far as personal\r\n     sentiments are concerned, I believe they are as well among us as\r\n     they can be.\r\n\r\nOne other incident he describes to his wife:--\r\n\r\n     Peel thought I should ask an audience of the Queen on my\r\n     retirement, and accordingly at the palace to-day (Feb. 3) he\r\n     intimated, and then the lord-in-waiting, as is the usage, formally\r\n     requested it. I saw the Queen in her private sitting-room. As she\r\n     did not commence speaking immediately after the first bow, I\r\n     thought it my part to do so; and I said, 'I have had the boldness\r\n     to request an audience, madam, that I might say with how much pain\r\n     it is that I find myself separated from your Majesty's service, and\r\n     how gratefully I feel your Majesty's many acts of kindness.' She\r\n     replied that she regretted it very much, and that it was a great\r\n     loss. I resumed that I had the greatest comfort I could enjoy under\r\n     the circumstances in the knowledge that my feelings towards her\r\n     Majesty's person and service, and also towards Sir R. Peel and my\r\n     late colleagues, were altogether unchanged by my retirement. After\r\n     a few words more she spoke of the state of the country and the\r\n     reduced condition of Chartism, of which I said I believed the main\r\n     feeder was want of employment. At the pauses I watched her eye for\r\n     the first sign to retire. But she asked me about you before we\r\n     concluded. Then one bow at the spot and another at the door, which\r\n     was very near, and so it was all over.\r\n\r\n      _Feb. 4._--Ruminated on the dangers of my explanation right and\r\n     left, and it made me unusually nervous. H. of C. 41/2-9. I was kindly\r\n     spoken of and heard, and I hope attained practically purposes I had\r\n     in view, but I think the House felt that the last part by taking\r\n     away the sting reduced the matter to flatness.\r\n\r\n                        RESIGNATION OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nAccording to what is perhaps a questionable usage, Lord John Russell\r\ninvited the retiring minister to explain his secession from office to\r\nthe House. In the suspicion, distraction, tension that marked that\r\nominous hour in the history of English party, people insisted that the\r\nresignation of the head of the department of trade must be due to\r\ndivergence of judgment upon protection. The prime minister, while\r\nexpressing in terms of real feeling his admiration for Mr. Gladstone's\r\ncharacter and ability, and his high regard for his colleague's private\r\nqualities, thought well to restate that the resignation came from no\r\nquestion of commercial policy. 'For three years,' he went on, 'I have\r\nbeen closely connected with Mr. Gladstone in the introduction of\r\nmeasures relating to the financial policy of the country, and I feel it\r\nmy duty openly to avow that it seems almost impossible that two public\r\nmen, acting together so long, should have had so little divergence in\r\ntheir opinions upon such questions.' If anybody found fault with Mr.\r\nGladstone for not resigning earlier, the prime minister was himself\r\nresponsible: 'I was unwilling to lose until the latest moment the\r\nadvantages I derived from one whom I consider capable of the highest and\r\nmost eminent services.'[168]\r\n\r\nThe point of Mr. Gladstone's reply was in fact an extremely simple and a\r\nhighly honourable one. While carefully abstaining from laying down any\r\ntheory of political affairs as under all circumstances inflexible and\r\nimmutable, yet he thought that one who had borne such solemn testimony\r\nas he had borne in his book, to a particular view of a great question,\r\nought not to make himself responsible for a material departure from it,\r\nwithout at least placing himself openly in a position to form a judgment\r\nthat should be beyond all mistake at once independent and unsuspected.\r\nThat position in respect of the Maynooth policy he could not hold, so\r\nlong as he was a member of the cabinet proposing it, and therefore he\r\nhad resigned, though it was understood that he would not resist the\r\nMaynooth increase itself. All this, I fancy, might easily have been made\r\nplain even to those who thought his action a display of overstrained\r\nmoral delicacy. As it was, his anxiety to explore every nook and cranny\r\nof his case, and to defend or discover in it every point that human\r\ningenuity could devise for attack, led him to speak for more than an\r\nhour; at the end of which even friendly and sympathetic listeners were\r\nleft wholly at a loss for a clue to the labyrinth. 'What a marvellous\r\ntalent is this,' Cobden exclaimed to a friend sitting near him; 'here\r\nhave I been sitting listening with pleasure for an hour to his\r\nexplanation, and yet I know no more why he left the government than\r\nbefore he began.' 'I could not but know,' Mr. Gladstone wrote on this\r\nincident long years after, 'that I should inevitably be regarded as\r\nfastidious and fanciful, fitter for a dreamer or possibly a schoolman,\r\nthan for the active purposes of public life in a busy and moving\r\nage.'[169]\r\n\r\n                      VIEWS OF HIS RESIGNATION\r\n\r\nSir Robert Inglis begged him to lead the opposition to the bill. In the\r\ncourse of the conversation Inglis went back to the fatal character and\r\nconsequences of the Act of 1829; and wished that his advice had then\r\nbeen taken, which was that the Duke of Cumberland should be sent as lord\r\nlieutenant to Ireland with thirty thousand men. 'As that good and very\r\nkind man spoke the words,' Mr. Gladstone says, 'my blood ran cold, and\r\nhe too had helped me onwards in the path before me.' William Palmer\r\nwrote that the grant to Maynooth was the sin of 1829 over again, and\r\nwould bring with it the same destruction of the conservative party. Lord\r\nWinchilsea, one of his patrons at Newark, protested against anything\r\nthat savoured of the national endowment of Romanism. Mr. Disraeli was\r\nreported as saying that with his resignation on Maynooth Mr. Gladstone's\r\ncareer was over.\r\n\r\nThe rough verdict pronounced his act a piece of political prudery. One\r\njournalistic wag observed, 'A lady's footman jumped off the Great\r\nWestern train, going forty miles an hour, merely to pick up his hat.\r\nPretty much like this act, so disproportional to the occasion, is Mr.\r\nGladstone's leap out of the ministry to follow his book.' When the time\r\ncame he voted for the second reading of the Maynooth bill (April 11)\r\nwith remarkable emphasis. 'I am prepared, in opposition to what I\r\nbelieve to be the prevailing opinion of the people of England and of\r\nScotland, in opposition to the judgment of my own constituents, from\r\nwhom I greatly regret to differ, and in opposition to my own deeply\r\ncherished predilections, to give a deliberate and even anxious support\r\nto the measure.'\r\n\r\nThe 'dreamer and the schoolman' meanwhile had left behind him a towering\r\nmonument of hard and strenuous labour in the shape of that second and\r\ngreater reform of the tariff, in which, besides the removal of the\r\nexport duty on coal and less serious commodities, no fewer than four\r\nhundred and thirty articles were swept altogether away from the list of\r\nthe customs officer. Glass was freed from an excise amounting to twice\r\nor thrice the value of the article, and the whole figure of remission\r\nwas nearly three times as large as the corresponding figure in the bold\r\noperations of 1842. Whether the budget of 1842 or that of 1845 marked\r\nthe more extensive advance, we need not discuss; it is enough that Mr.\r\nGladstone himself set down the construction of these two tariffs among\r\nthe principal achievements in the history of his legislative works. His\r\nunofficial relations with the colleagues whom he had left were perfectly\r\nunchanged. 'You will be glad to know,' he writes to his father, 'that\r\nthe best feeling, as I believe, subsists between us. Although our powers\r\nof entertaining guests are not of the first order, yet with a view\r\npartly to these occurrences we asked Sir R. and Lady Peel to dinner\r\nto-day, and also Lord and Lady Stanley and Lord Aberdeen. All accepted,\r\nbut unfortunately an invitation to Windsor has carried off Sir R. and\r\nLady Peel. A small matter, but I mention it as a symbol of what is\r\nmaterial.'\r\n\r\nBefore many days were over, he was working day and night on a projected\r\nstatement, involving much sifting and preparation, upon the recent\r\ncommercial legislation. Lord John Russell had expressed a desire for a\r\ncompetent commentary on the results of the fiscal changes of 1842, and\r\nthe pamphlet in which Mr. Gladstone showed what those results had been\r\nwas the reply. Three editions of it were published within the year.[170]\r\n\r\nThis was not the only service that Mr. Gladstone had an opportunity of\r\nrendering in the course of the session to the government that he had\r\nquitted. 'Peel,' he says, 'had a plan for the admission of free labour\r\nsugar on terms of favour. Lord Palmerston made a motion to show that\r\nthis involved a breach of our old treaties with Spain. I examined the\r\ncase laboriously, and, though I think his facts could not be denied, I\r\nundertook (myself out of office) to answer him on behalf of the\r\ngovernment. This I did, and Peel, who was the most conscientious man I\r\never knew in spareness of eulogium, said to me when I sat down, \"That\r\nwas a wonderful speech, Gladstone.\"' The speech took four hours, and\r\nwas, I think, the last that he made in parliament for two years and a\r\nhalf, for reasons that we shall presently discover.\r\n\r\n                    THOUGHTS OF VISITING IRELAND\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1845, Mr. Gladstone made a proposal to Hope-Scott. 'As\r\nIreland,' he said, 'is likely to find this country and parliament so\r\nmuch employment for years to come, I feel rather oppressively an\r\nobligation to try and see it with my own eyes instead of using those of\r\nother people, according to the limited measure of my means.' He\r\nsuggested that they should devote some time 'to a working tour in\r\nIreland, eschewing all grandeur and taking little account of scenery,\r\ncompared with the purpose of looking at close quarters at the\r\ninstitutions for religion and education of the country and at the\r\ncharacter of the people.' Philip Pusey was inclined to join them. 'It\r\nwill not alarm you,' says Pusey, 'if I state my belief that in these\r\nagrarian outrages the Irish peasants have been engaged in a justifiable\r\ncivil war, because the peasant ejected from his land could no longer by\r\nany efforts of his own preserve his family from the risk of starvation.\r\nThis view is that of a very calm utilitarian, George Lewis.'[171] They\r\nwere to start from Cork and the south and work their way round by the\r\nwest, carrying with them Lewis's book, blue books, and a volume or two\r\nof Plato, AEschylus, and the rest. The expedition was put off by Pusey's\r\ndiscovery that the _Times_ was despatching a correspondent to carry on\r\nagrarian investigations. Mr. Gladstone urged that the Irish land\r\nquestion was large enough for two, and so indeed it swiftly proved, for\r\nIreland was now on the edge of the black abysses of the famine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[167] The letters from Mr. Gladstone to Peel on this topic are given by\r\nMr. Parker, _Peel_, iii. pp. 160, 163, 166.\r\n\r\n[168] In the course of May, 1845, Peel made some remarks on\r\nresignations, of which Mr. Gladstone thought the report worth\r\npreserving:--'I admit that there may be many occasions when it would be\r\nthe duty of a public man to retire from office, rather than propose\r\nmeasures which are contrary to the principles he has heretofore\r\nsupported. I think that the propriety of his taking that course will\r\nmainly depend upon the effect which his retirement will have upon the\r\nsuccess of that public measure, which he believes to be necessary for\r\nthe good of his country. I think it was perfectly honourable, perfectly\r\njust, in my right honourable friend the late president of the board of\r\ntrade to relinquish office. The hon. gentleman thinks I ought to have\r\npursued the same course in 1829. That was precisely the course I wished\r\nto pursue--it was precisely the course which I intended to pursue. Until\r\nwithin a month of the period when I consented to bring forward the\r\nmeasure for the relief of the Roman catholics, I did contemplate\r\nretiring from office--not because I shrank from the responsibility of\r\nproposing that measure--not from the fear of being charged with\r\ninconsistency--not because I was not prepared to make the painful\r\nsacrifice of private friendships and political connections, but because\r\nI believed that my retirement from office would promote the success of\r\nthe measure. I thought that I should more efficiently assist my noble\r\nfriend in carrying that measure if I retired from office, and gave the\r\nmeasure my cordial support in a private capacity. I changed my opinion\r\nwhen it was demonstrated to me that there was a necessity for\r\nsacrificing my own feelings by retaining office--when it was shown to me\r\nthat, however humble my abilities, yet, considering the station which I\r\noccupied, my retiring from office would render the carrying of that\r\nmeasure totally impossible--when it was proved to me that there were\r\nobjections in the highest quarters which would not be overcome unless I\r\nwas prepared to sacrifice much that was dear to me--when it was\r\nintimated to my noble friend that there was an intention on the part of\r\nthe highest authorities in the church of England to offer a decided\r\nopposition to the measure, and when my noble friend intimated to me that\r\nhe thought, if I persevered in my intention to retire, success was out\r\nof the question. It was then I did not hesitate to say that I would not\r\nexpose others to obloquy or suspicions from which I myself shrunk.'\r\n\r\n[169] _Gleanings_, vii. p. 118.\r\n\r\n[170] 'Remarks upon recent Commercial Legislation suggested by the\r\nexpository statement of the Revenue from Customs, and other Papers\r\nlately submitted to Parliament, by the Right Hon.

Mr. Gladstone had written on the same\r\nsubject in the _Foreign and Colonial Quarterly Review_, January 1843.\r\n\r\n[171] See his memorable work on Irish Disturbances, published in 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n              TRIUMPH OF POLICY AND FALL OF THE MINISTER\r\n\r\n                              (_1846_)\r\n\r\n     Change of opinion, in those to whose judgment the public looks more\r\n     or less to assist its own, is an evil to the country, although a\r\n     much smaller evil than their persistence in a course which they\r\n     know to be wrong. It is not always to be blamed. But it is always\r\n     to be watched with vigilance; always to be challenged and put upon\r\n     its trial.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\nNot lingering for the moment on Mr. Gladstone's varied pre-occupations\r\nduring 1845, and not telling over again the well-known story of the\r\ncircumstances that led to the repeal of the corn law, I pass rapidly to\r\nMr. Gladstone's part--it was a secondary part--in the closing act of the\r\nexciting political drama on which the curtain had risen in 1841. The end\r\nof the session of 1845 had left the government in appearance even\r\nstronger than it was in the beginning of 1842. Two of the most sagacious\r\nactors knew better what this was worth. Disraeli was aware how the ties\r\nhad been loosened between the minister and his supporters, and Cobden\r\nwas aware that, in words used at the time, 'three weeks of rain when the\r\nwheat was ripening would rain away the corn law.'[172]\r\n\r\n                         AN EXCITING DECEMBER\r\n\r\nEverybody knows how the rain came, and alarming signs of a dreadful\r\nfamine in Ireland came; how Peel advised his cabinet to open the ports\r\nfor a limited period, but without promising them that if the corn duties\r\nwere ever taken off, they could ever be put on again; how Lord John\r\nseized the moment, wrote an Edinburgh letter, and declared for total and\r\nimmediate repeal; how the minister once more called his cabinet\r\ntogether, invited them to support him in settling the question, and as\r\nthey would not all assent, resigned; how Lord John tried to form a\r\ngovernment and failed; and how Sir Robert again became first minister of\r\nthe crown, but not bringing all his colleagues back with him. 'I think,'\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone in later days, 'he expected to carry the repeal of\r\nthe corn law without breaking up his party, but meant at all hazard to\r\ncarry it.'\r\n\r\n     Peel's conduct in 1846, Lord Aberdeen said to a friend ten years\r\n     later, was very noble. With the exception of Graham and myself, his\r\n     whole cabinet was against him. Lyndhurst, Goulburn, and Stanley\r\n     were almost violent in their resistance. Still more opposed to him,\r\n     if it were possible, was the Duke of Wellington. To break up the\r\n     cabinet was an act of great courage. To resume office when Lord\r\n     John had failed in constructing one, was still more courageous. He\r\n     said to the Queen: 'I am ready to kiss hands as your minister\r\n     to-night. I believe I can collect a ministry which will last long\r\n     enough to carry free trade, and I am ready to make the attempt.'\r\n     When he said this there were only two men on whom he could rely.\r\n     One of the first to join him was Wellington. 'The Queen's\r\n     government,' he said, 'must be carried on. We have done all that we\r\n     could for the landed interest. Now we must do all that we can for\r\n     the Queen.'[173]\r\n\r\nOn one of the days of this startling December, Mr. Gladstone writes to\r\nhis father: 'If Peel determines to form a government, and if he sends\r\nfor me (a compound uncertainty), I cannot judge what to do until I know\r\nmuch more than at present of the Irish case. It is there if anywhere\r\nthat he must find his justification; there if anywhere that one returned\r\nto parliament as I am, can honestly find reason for departing at this\r\ntime from the present corn law.' Two other letters of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nshow us more fully why he followed Peel instead of joining the\r\ndissentients, of whom the most important was Lord Stanley. The first of\r\nthese was written to his father four and a half years later:--\r\n\r\n     _6 Carlton Gardens, June 30, 1849._--As respects my 'having made\r\n     Peel a free trader,' I have never seen that idea expressed\r\n     anywhere, and I think it is one that does great injustice to the\r\n     character and power of his mind. In every case, however, the head\r\n     of a government may be influenced more or less in the affairs of\r\n     each department of state by the person in charge of that\r\n     department. If, then, there was any influence at all upon Peel's\r\n     mind proceeding from me between 1841 and 1845, I have no doubt it\r\n     may have tended on the whole towards free trade.... But all this\r\n     ceased with the measures of 1845, when I left office. It was during\r\n     the alarm of a potato famine in the autumn of that year that the\r\n     movement in the government about the corn laws began. I was then on\r\n     the continent, looking after Helen [his sister], and not dreaming\r\n     of office or public affairs.... I myself had invariably, during\r\n     Peel's government, spoken of protection not as a thing good in\r\n     principle, but to be dealt with as tenderly and cautiously as might\r\n     be according to circumstances, always moving in the direction of\r\n     free trade. It _then_ appeared to me that the case was materially\r\n     altered by events; it was no longer open to me to pursue that\r\n     cautious course. A great struggle was imminent, in which it was\r\n     plain that two parties only could really find place, on the one\r\n     side for repeal, on the other side for _permanent_ maintenance of a\r\n     corn law and a protective system generally and on principle. It\r\n     would have been more inconsistent in me, even if consistency had\r\n     been the rule, to join the latter party than the former. But\r\n     independently of that, I thought, and still think, that the\r\n     circumstances of the case justified and required the change. So far\r\n     as relates to the final change in the corn law, you will see that\r\n     no influence proceeded from me, but rather that events over which I\r\n     had no control, and steps taken by Sir R. Peel while I was out of\r\n     the government, had an influence upon me in inducing me to take\r\n     office. I noticed some days ago that you had made an observation on\r\n     this subject, but I did not recollect that it was a question. Had I\r\n     adverted to this I should have answered it at once. If I had any\r\n     motive for avoiding the subject, it was, I think, this--that it is\r\n     not easy to discuss such a question as that of an influence of mine\r\n     over a mind so immeasurably superior, without something of egotism\r\n     and vanity.\r\n\r\n                          SECRETARY OF STATE\r\n\r\nSo much for the general situation. The second letter is to Mrs.\r\nGladstone, and contributes some personal details:--\r\n\r\n     _13 Carlton House Terrace, Dec. 22, 6 P.M., 1845._--It is offensive\r\n     to begin about myself, but I must. Within the last two hours I have\r\n     accepted the office of secretary for the colonies, succeeding Lord\r\n     Stanley, who resigns. The last twenty-four have been very anxious\r\n     hours. Yesterday afternoon (two hours after Holy Communion) Lincoln\r\n     came to make an appointment on Peel's part. I went to meet him in\r\n     Lincoln's house at five o'clock. He detailed to me the\r\n     circumstances connected with the late political changes, asked me\r\n     for no reply, and gave me quantities of papers to read, including\r\n     letters of his own, the Queen's, and Lord J. Russell's, during the\r\n     crisis. This morning I had a conversation with Bonham [the party\r\n     whipper-in] upon the general merits, but without telling him\r\n     precisely what the proposal made to me was. Upon the whole my mind,\r\n     though I felt the weight of the question, was clear. I had to\r\n     decide what was best to be done _now_. I arrived speedily at the\r\n     conviction that _now_, at any rate, it is best that the question\r\n     should be finally settled; that Peel ought and is bound now to try\r\n     it; that I ought to support it in parliament; that if, in deciding\r\n     the mode, he endeavours to include the most favourable terms for\r\n     the agricultural body that it is in his power to obtain, I ought\r\n     not only to support it, by which I mean vote for it in parliament,\r\n     but likewise not to refuse to be a party to the proposal. I found\r\n     from him that he entirely recognised this view, and did feel\r\n     himself bound to make the best terms that he believed attainable,\r\n     while, on the other hand, I am convinced that we are now in a\r\n     position that requires provision to be made for the final abolition\r\n     of the corn law. Such being the state of matters, with a clear\r\n     conscience, but with a heavy heart, I accepted office. He was\r\n     exceedingly warm and kind. But it _was_ with a heavy heart.... I\r\n     have seen Lord Stanley. 'I am extremely glad to hear you have taken\r\n     office,' said he. We go to Windsor to-morrow to a council--he to\r\n     resign the seals, and I to receive them.\r\n\r\nIn the diary he enters:--\r\n\r\n     Saw Sir R. Peel at 3, and accepted office--in opposition, as I have\r\n     the consolation of feeling, to my leanings and desires, and with\r\n     the most precarious prospects. Peel was most kind, nay fatherly. We\r\n     _held_ hands instinctively, and I could not but reciprocate with\r\n     emphasis his 'God bless you.'\r\n\r\n     I well remember, Mr. Gladstone wrote in a memorandum of Oct. 4,\r\n     1851, Peel's using language to me in the Duke of Newcastle's house\r\n     on Sunday, Dec. 21, 1845, which, as I conceive, distinctly\r\n     intimated his belief that he would be able to carry his measure,\r\n     and at the same time hold his party together. He spoke with a kind\r\n     of glee and complacency in his tone when he said, making up his\r\n     meaning by signs, 'I have not lived near forty years in public life\r\n     to find myself wholly without the power of foreseeing the course of\r\n     events in the House of Commons'--in reference to the very point of\r\n     the success of his government.\r\n\r\nOne thing is worth noting as we pass. The exact proceedings of the\r\nmemorable cabinets of November and the opening days of December are\r\nstill obscure. It has generally been held that Disraeli planted a rather\r\nawkward stroke when he taunted Peel with his inconsistency in declaring\r\nthat he was not the proper minister to propose repeal, and yet in trying\r\nto persuade his colleagues to make the attempt before giving the whigs a\r\nchance. The following note of Mr. Gladstone's (written in 1851 after\r\nreading Sir R. Peel's original memoir on the Corn Act of 1846) throws\r\nsome light on the question:--\r\n\r\n     When Sir R. Peel invited me to take office in December 1845 he did\r\n     not make me aware of the offer he had made to the cabinet in his\r\n     memorandum, I think of Dec. 2, to propose a new corn law with a\r\n     lowered sliding duty, which should diminish annually by a shilling\r\n     until in some eight or ten years the trade would be free. No doubt\r\n     he felt that after Lord John Russell had made his attempt to form a\r\n     government, and after, by Lord Stanley's resignation, he had lost\r\n     the advantages of unanimity, he could not be justified in a\r\n     proposal involving so considerable an element of protection. It has\r\n     become matter of history. But as matter of history it is important\r\n     to show how honestly and perseveringly he strove to hold the\r\n     balance fairly between contending claims, and how far he was from\r\n     being the mere puppet of abstract theories.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, what he proposed to his cabinet early in December was\r\nnot the total and immediate repeal to which he was led by events before\r\nthe end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                           OUT OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of office vacated the seat at Newark, and Mr. Gladstone\r\ndeclined to offer himself again as a candidate. He had been member for\r\nNewark for thirteen years, and had been five times elected. So ended his\r\nconnection with the first of the five constituencies that in his course\r\nhe represented. 'I part from my constituents,' he tells his father,\r\n'with deep regret. Though I took office under circumstances which might\r\nreasonably arouse the jealousy of my friends, an agricultural\r\nconstituency, the _great_ majority of my committee were prepared to\r\nsupport me, and took action and strong measures in my favour.' 'My deep\r\nobligation,' he says, 'to the Duke of Newcastle for the great benefit he\r\nconferred upon me, not only by his unbroken support, but, far above all,\r\nby his original introduction of me to the constituency, made it my duty\r\nat once to decline some overtures made to me for the support of my\r\nre-election, so it only remained to seek a seat elsewhere.' Some faint\r\nhopes were entertained by Mr. Gladstone's friends that the duke might\r\nallow him to sit for the rest of the parliament, but the duke was not\r\nthe man to make concessions to a betrayer of the territorial interest.\r\nMr. Gladstone, too, we must not forget, was still and for many years to\r\ncome, a tory. When it was suggested that he might stand for North Notts,\r\nhe wrote to Lord Lincoln:--'It is not for one of my political opinions\r\nwithout an extreme necessity to stand upon the basis of democratic or\r\npopular feeling against the local proprietary: for you who are placed in\r\nthe soil the case is very different.'\r\n\r\nSoon after the session of 1846 began, it became known that the\r\nprotectionist petition against the Peelite or liberal sitting member for\r\nWigan was likely to succeed in unseating him. 'Proposals were made to me\r\nto succeed him, which were held to be eligible. I even wrote my address;\r\non a certain day, I was going down by the mail train. But it was an\r\nobject for our opponents to keep a secretary of state out of parliament\r\nduring the corn law crisis, and their petition was suddenly withdrawn.\r\nThe consequence was that I remained until the resignation of the\r\ngovernment in July a minister of the crown without a seat in parliament.\r\nThis was a state of things not agreeable to the spirit of parliamentary\r\ngovernment; and some objection was taken, but rather slightly, in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Sir R. Peel stood fire.' There can be little doubt\r\nthat in our own day a cabinet minister without a seat in either House of\r\nparliament would be regarded, in Mr. Gladstone's words, as a public\r\ninconvenience and a political anomaly, too _dark_ to be tolerated; and\r\nhe naturally felt it his absolute duty to peep in at every chink and\r\ncranny where a seat in parliament could be had. A Peelite, however, had\r\nnot a good chance at a by-election, and Mr. Gladstone remained out of\r\nthe House until the general election in the year following.[174] Lord\r\nLincoln, also a member of the cabinet, vacated his seat, but, unlike his\r\nfriend, found a seat in the course of the session.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's brother-in-law, Lyttelton, was invited to represent the\r\ncolonial office in the Lords, but had qualms of conscience about the\r\neternal question of the two Welsh bishoprics. 'How could the government\r\nof this wonderful empire,' Peel wrote to Mr. Gladstone, 'be ever\r\nconstructed, if a difference on such a point were to be an obstruction\r\nto union? Might not any one now say with perfect honour and, what is of\r\nmore importance (if they are not identical), perfect satisfaction to his\r\nown conscience, \"I will not so far set up my own judgment on one\r\nisolated measure against that of a whole administration, to such an\r\nextent as to preclude me from co-operation with them at a critical\r\nperiod.\" This, of course, assumes general accordance of sentiment on the\r\ngreat outlines of public policy.' Wise words and sound, that might\r\nprevent some of the worst mistakes of some of the best men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                          THE SESSION OF 1846\r\n\r\nThis memorable session of 1846 was not a session of argument, but of\r\nlobby computations. The case had been argued to the dregs, the\r\nconclusion was fixed, and all interest was centred in the play of\r\nforces, the working of high motives and low, the balance of parties, the\r\nsecret ambitions and antagonism of persons. Mr. Gladstone therefore was\r\nnot in the shaping of the parliamentary result seriously missed, as he\r\nhad been missed in 1845. 'It soon became evident,' says a leading whig\r\nin his journal of the time, 'that Peel had very much over-rated his\r\nstrength. Even the expectation of December that he could have carried\r\nwith him enough of his own followers to enable Lord John, if that\r\nstatesman had contrived to form a government, to pass the repeal of the\r\ncorn law, was perceived to have been groundless, when the formidable\r\nnumber of the protectionist dissentients appeared. So many even of those\r\nwho remained with Peel avowed that they disapproved of the measure, and\r\nonly voted in its favour for the purpose of supporting Peel's\r\ngovernment.'[175] The tyranny of the accomplished fact obscures one's\r\nsense of the danger that Peel's high courage averted. It is not certain\r\nthat Lord John as head of a government could have carried the whole body\r\nof whigs for total and immediate repeal, Lord Lansdowne and Palmerston\r\nopenly stating their preference for a fixed duty, and not a few of the\r\nsmaller men cursing the precipitancy of the Edinburgh letter. It is\r\ncertain, as is intimated above, that Peel could not have carried over to\r\nhim the whole of the 112 men who voted for repeal solely because it was\r\nhis measure. In the course of this session Sir John Hobhouse met Mr.\r\nDisraeli at an evening party, and expressed a fear lest Peel having\r\nbroken up one party would also be the means of breaking up the other.\r\n'That, you may depend upon it, he will,' replied Disraeli, 'or any other\r\nparty that he has anything to do with.' It was not long after this, when\r\nall was over, that the Duke of Wellington told Lord John that he\r\nthought Peel was tired of party and was determined to destroy it. After\r\nthe repeal of the corn law was safe, the minister was beaten on the\r\nIrish coercion bill by what Wellington called a 'blackguard combination'\r\nbetween the whigs and the protectionists. He resigned, and Lord John\r\nRussell at the head of the whigs came in.\r\n\r\n'Until three or four days before the division on the coercion bill,' Mr.\r\nGladstone says in a memorandum written at the time, 'I had not the\r\nsmallest idea, beyond mere conjecture, of the views and intentions of\r\nSir R. Peel with respect to himself or to his government. Only we had\r\nbeen governed in all questions, so far as I knew, by the determination\r\nto carry the corn bill and to let no collateral circumstance interfere\r\nwith that main purpose.... He sent round a memorandum some days before\r\nthe division arguing for resignation against dissolution. There was also\r\na correspondence between the Duke of Wellington and him. The duke argued\r\nfor holding our ground and dissolving. But when we met in cabinet on\r\nFriday the 26th of June, not an opposing voice was raised. It was the\r\nshortest cabinet I ever knew. Peel himself uttered two or three\r\nintroductory sentences. He then said that he was convinced that the\r\nformation of a conservative party was impossible while he continued in\r\noffice. That he had made up his mind to resign. That he strongly advised\r\nthe resignation of the entire government. Some declared their assent.\r\nNone objected; and when he asked whether it was unanimous, there was no\r\nvoice in the negative.' 'This was simply,' as Mr. Gladstone added in\r\nlater notes, 'because he had very distinctly and positively stated his\r\nown resolution to resign. It amounted therefore to this,--no one\r\nproposed to go on without him.' One other note of Mr. Gladstone's on\r\nthis grave decision is worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n     I must put into words the opinion which I silently formed in my\r\n     room at the colonial office in June 1846, when I got the\r\n     circulation box with Peel's own memorandum not only arguing in\r\n     favour of resignation but intimating his own intention to resign,\r\n     and with the Duke of Wellington's in the opposite sense. The duke,\r\n     in my opinion, was right and Peel wrong, but he had borne the brunt\r\n     of battle already beyond the measure of human strength, and who can\r\n     wonder that his heart and soul as well as his physical organisation\r\n     needed rest?[176]\r\n\r\n                       DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIn announcing his retirement to the House (June 29), Peel passed a\r\nmagnanimous and magnificent eulogium on Cobden.[177] Strange to say, the\r\npanegyric gave much offence, and among others to Mr. Gladstone. The next\r\nday he entered in his diary:--\r\n\r\n     Much comment is made upon Peel's declaration about Cobden last\r\n     night. My objection to it is that it did not do full justice. For\r\n     if his power of discussion has been great and his end good, his\r\n     tone has been most harsh and his imputation of bad and vile motives\r\n     to honourable men incessant. I do not think the thing was done in a\r\n     manner altogether worthy of Peel's mind. But he, like some smaller\r\n     men, is, I think, very sensible of the sweetness of the cheers of\r\n     opponents.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself at the time as 'grieved and hurt' at these closing\r\nsentences; and even a year later, in answer to some inquiry from his\r\nfather, who still remained protectionist, he wrote: 'July 1, '47.--I do\r\nnot know anything about Peel's having repented of his speech about\r\nCobden; but I hope that he has seen the great objection to which it is,\r\nas I think, fairly open.' Some of his own men who voted for Peel\r\ndeclared that after this speech they bitterly repented.\r\n\r\n                       PEEL'S TRIBUTE TO COBDEN\r\n\r\nThe suspected personal significance of the Cobden panegyric is described\r\nin a memorandum written by Mr. Gladstone a few days later (July 12):--\r\n\r\n     A day or two afterwards I met Lord Stanley crossing the park, and\r\n     we had some conversation, first on colonial matters. Then he said,\r\n     'Well, I think our friend Peel went rather far last night about\r\n     Cobden, did he not?' I stated to him my very deep regret on reading\r\n     that passage (as well as what followed about the monopolists), and\r\n     that, not for its impolicy but for its injustice. All that he said\r\n     was true, but he did not say the whole truth; and the effect of the\r\n     whole, as a whole, was therefore untrue. Mr. Cobden has throughout\r\n     argued the corn question on the principle of holding up the\r\n     landlords of England to the people, as plunderers and as knaves for\r\n     maintaining the corn law to save their rents, and as fools because\r\n     it was not necessary for that purpose. This was passed by, while he\r\n     was praised for sincerity, eloquence, indefatigable zeal.\r\n\r\n     On Thursday the 2nd I saw Lord Aberdeen. He agreed in the general\r\n     regret at the tone of that part of the speech. He said he feared it\r\n     was designed with a view to its effects, for the purpose of making\r\n     it impossible that Peel should ever again be placed in connection\r\n     with the conservative party as a party. He said that Peel had\r\n     absolutely made up his mind never again to lead it, never again to\r\n     enter office; that he had indeed made up his mind, at one time, to\r\n     quit parliament, but that probably on the Queen's account, and in\r\n     deference to her wishes, he had abandoned this part of his\r\n     intentions. But that he was fixed in the idea to maintain his\r\n     independent and separate position, taking part in public questions\r\n     as his views of public interests might from time to time seem to\r\n     require. I represented that this for _him_, and in the House of\r\n     Commons, was an intention absolutely impossible to fulfil; that\r\n     with his greatness he could not remain there overshadowing and\r\n     eclipsing all governments, and yet have to do with no governments;\r\n     that acts cannot for such a man be isolated, they must be in\r\n     series, and his view of public affairs must coincide with one body\r\n     of men rather than another, and that the attraction must place him\r\n     in relations with them. Lord Aberdeen said that Earl Spencer in his\r\n     later days was Sir R. Peel's ideal,--rare appearances for serious\r\n     purposes, and without compromise generally to the independence of\r\n     his personal habits. I put it that this was possible in the House\r\n     of Lords, but only there.... On Saturday I saw him again as he came\r\n     from the palace. He represented that the Queen was sorely grieved\r\n     at this change; which indeed I had already heard from Catherine\r\n     through Lady Lyttelton, but this showed that it continued. And\r\n     again on Monday we heard through Lady Lyttelton that the Queen said\r\n     it was a comfort to think that the work of that day would soon be\r\n     over. It appears too that she spoke of the kindness she had\r\n     received from her late ministers; and that the Prince's sentiments\r\n     are quite as decided.\r\n\r\n     On Monday we delivered up the seals at our several audiences. Her\r\n     Majesty said simply but very kindly to me, 'I am very sorry to\r\n     receive them from you.' I thanked her for my father's baronetcy,\r\n     and apologised for his not coming to court. She had her glove half\r\n     off, which made me think I was to kiss hands; but she simply bowed\r\n     and retired. Her eyes told tales, but she smiled and put on a\r\n     cheerful countenance. It was in fact the 1st of September 1841 over\r\n     again as to feelings; but this time with more mature judgment and\r\n     longer experience. Lord Aberdeen and Sir J. Graham kissed hands,\r\n     but this was by favour.\r\n\r\n     The same night I saw Sidney Herbert at Lady Pembroke's. He gave me\r\n     in great part the same view of Sir R. Peel's speech, himself\r\n     holding the same opinion with Lord Aberdeen. But he thought that\r\n     Peel's natural temper, which he said is very violent though usually\r\n     under thorough discipline, broke out and coloured that part of the\r\n     speech, but that the end in view was to cut off all possibility of\r\n     reunion. He referred to a late conversation with Peel, in which\r\n     Peel had intimated his intention of remaining in parliament and\r\n     acting for himself without party, to which Herbert replied that he\r\n     knew of no minister who had done so except lord Bute, a bad\r\n     precedent. Peel rejoined 'Lord Grenville,' showing that his mind\r\n     had been at work upon the subject. He had heard him not long ago\r\n     discussing his position with Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham,\r\n     when he said, putting his hand up to the side of his head, 'Ah! you\r\n     do not know what I suffer here.'\r\n\r\n     Yesterday Lord Lyndhurst called on me.... He proceeded to ask me\r\n     what I thought with respect to our political course. He said he\r\n     conceived that the quarrel was a bygone quarrel, that the\r\n     animosities attending it ought now to be forgotten, and the old\r\n     relations of amity and confidence among the members of the\r\n     conservative body resumed. I told him, in the first place, that I\r\n     felt some difficulty in answering him in my state of total\r\n     ignorance, so far as direct communication is concerned, of Sir R.\r\n     Peel's knowledge and intentions; that on Tuesday I had seen him on\r\n     colonial matters, and had talked on the probable intentions of the\r\n     new government as to the sugar duties, but that I did not like to\r\n     ask what he did not seem to wish to tell, and that I did not obtain\r\n     the smallest inkling of light as to his intentions in respect to\r\n     that very matter now immediately pending. He observed it was a pity\r\n     Sir R. Peel was so uncommunicative; but that after having been so\r\n     long connected with him, he would certainly be very unwilling to do\r\n     anything disagreeable to him; still, if I and others thought fit,\r\n     he was ready to do what he could towards putting the party together\r\n     again. I then replied that I thought, so far as extinguishing the\r\n     animosities which had been raised in connection with the corn law\r\n     was concerned, I could not doubt its propriety, that I thought we\r\n     were bound to give a fair trial to the government, and not to\r\n     assume beforehand an air of opposition, and that if so much of\r\n     confidence is due to them, much more is it due towards friends from\r\n     whom we have differed on the single question of free trade, that\r\n     our confidence should be reposed in them. That I thought, however,\r\n     that in any case, before acting together as a party, we ought to\r\n     consider well the outline of our further course, particularly with\r\n     reference to Irish questions and the church there, as I was of\r\n     opinion that it was very doubtful whether we had now a\r\n     justification for opposing any change with respect to it, meaning\r\n     as to the property. He said with his accustomed facility, 'Ah yes,\r\n     it will require to be considered what course we shall take.'[178]\r\n\r\n                     CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES\r\n\r\n     I met Lord Aberdeen the same afternoon in Bond Street, and told him\r\n     the substance of this conversation. He said, 'It is stated that\r\n     Lord G. Bentinck is to resign, and that they are to have you.'\r\n     That, I replied, was quite new to me. The (late) chancellor had\r\n     simply said, when I pointed out that the difficulties lay in the\r\n     House of Commons, that it was true, and that my being there would\r\n     make the way more open. I confess I am very doubtful of that, and\r\n     much disposed to believe that I am regretted, as things and\r\n     persons _absent_ often are, in comparison with the present. At\r\n     dinner I sat between Graham and Jocelyn. The latter observed\r\n     particularly on the absence from Sir R. Peel's speech of any\r\n     acknowledgment towards his supporters and his colleagues. These\r\n     last, however, are named. Jocelyn said the new government were much\r\n     divided.... Jocelyn believes that Lord Palmerston will not be very\r\n     long in union with this cabinet.\r\n\r\n     With Sir J. Graham I had much interesting conversation. I told him,\r\n     I thought it but fair to mention to him the regret and blame which\r\n     I found to have been elicited from all persons whom I saw and\r\n     conversed with, by the passage relating to Cobden. He said he\r\n     believed it was the same on all hands; and that the new government\r\n     in particular were most indignant at it. He feared that it was\r\n     deliberately preconceived and for the purpose; and went on to\r\n     repeat what Lord Aberdeen had told me, that Sir R. Peel had been\r\n     within an ace of quitting parliament, and was determined to abjure\r\n     party and stand aloof for ever, and never resume office. I replied\r\n     as before, that in the House of Commons it was impossible. He went\r\n     on to sketch the same kind of future for himself. He was weary of\r\n     labour at thirteen or fourteen hours a day, and of the intolerable\r\n     abuse to which he was obliged to submit; but his habits were formed\r\n     in the House of Commons and for it, and he was desirous to continue\r\n     there as an independent gentleman, taking part from time to time in\r\n     public business as he might find occasion, and giving his leisure\r\n     to his family and to books. I said, 'Are you not building houses of\r\n     cards? Do you conceive that men who have played a great part, who\r\n     have swayed the great moving forces of the state, who have led the\r\n     House of Commons and given the tone to public policy, can at their\r\n     will remain there, but renounce the consequences of their\r\n     remaining, and refuse to fulfil what must fall to them in some\r\n     contingency of public affairs? The country will demand that they\r\n     who are the ablest shall not stand by inactive.' He said Sir Robert\r\n     Peel had all but given up his seat. I answered that would at any\r\n     rate have made his resolution a practicable one.\r\n\r\n     He said, 'You can have no conception of what the virulence is\r\n     against Peel and me.' I said, No; that from having been out of\r\n     parliament during these debates my sense of these things was less\r\n     lively and my position in some respects different. He replied,\r\n     'Your position is quite different. You are free to take any course\r\n     you please with perfect honour.' I told him of Lord Lyndhurst's\r\n     visit and the purport of his conversation, of the meaning of the\r\n     junction on the opposition bench in the Lords, and of what we had\r\n     said of the difficulties in the Commons. He said, 'My resentment is\r\n     not against the new government, but against the seventy-three\r\n     conservative members of parliament who displaced the late\r\n     government by a factious vote; nearly all of them believed the bill\r\n     to be necessary for Ireland; and they knew that our removal was not\r\n     desired by the crown, not desired by the country. I find no fault\r\n     with the new ministers, they are fairly in possession of power--but\r\n     with those gentlemen I can never unite.' Later, however, in the\r\n     evening he relented somewhat, and said he must admit that what they\r\n     did was done under great provocation; that it was no wonder they\r\n     regarded themselves as betrayed; and that unfortunately it had been\r\n     the fate of Sir R. Peel to perform a similar operation twice....\r\n\r\n     Graham dwelt with fondness and with pain on Lord Stanley; said he\r\n     had very great qualities--that his speech on the corn law,\r\n     consisting as it did simply of old fallacies though in new dress,\r\n     was a magnificent speech, one of his greatest and happiest\r\n     efforts--that all his conduct in the public eye had been perfectly\r\n     free from exception; that he feared, however, he had been much in\r\n     Lord Geo. Bentinck's counsels, and had concurred in much more than\r\n     he had himself done, and had aided in marking out the course taken\r\n     in the House of Commons. He had called on Lord Stanley several\r\n     times but had never been able to see him, he trusted through\r\n     accident, but seemed to doubt.\r\n\r\n     On the Cobden eulogy, though he did not defend it outright by any\r\n     means, he said, 'Do you think if Cobden had not existed the repeal\r\n     of the corn law would have been carried at this moment?' I said\r\n     very probably not, that he had added greatly to the force of the\r\n     movement and accelerated its issue, that I admitted the truth of\r\n     every word that Peel had uttered, but complained of its omissions,\r\n     of its spirit towards his own friends, of its false moral effect,\r\n     as well as and much more than of its mere impolicy.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      IV\r\n\r\n                         FAREWELL INTERVIEW WITH PEEL\r\n\r\nStill more interesting is an interview with the fallen minister himself,\r\nwritten ten days after it took place:--\r\n\r\n     _July 24._--On Monday the 13th I visited Sir R. Peel, and found him\r\n     in his dressing-room laid up with a cut in one of his feet. My\r\n     immediate purpose was to let him know the accounts from New Zealand\r\n     which Lord Grey had communicated to me.... However _I_ led on from\r\n     subject to subject, for I thought it my duty not to quit town, at\r\n     the end possibly of my political connection with Sir R. Peel, that\r\n     is if he determined to individualise himself, without giving the\r\n     opportunity at least for free communication. Though he opened\r\n     nothing, yet he followed unreluctantly. I said the government\r\n     appeared to show signs of internal discord or weakness. He said,\r\n     Yes; related that Lord John did not mean to include Lord Grey, that\r\n     he sent Sir G. Grey and C. Wood to propitiate him, that Lord Grey\r\n     was not only not hostile but volunteered his services. At last I\r\n     broke the ice and said, 'You have seen Lord Lyndhurst.' He said,\r\n     'Yes.' I mentioned the substance of my interview with Lord\r\n     Lyndhurst, and also what I had heard from Goulburn of his. He said,\r\n     'I am _hors de combat_.' I said to him, 'Is that possible? Whatever\r\n     your present intentions may be, can it be done?' He said he had\r\n     been twice prime minister, and nothing should induce him again to\r\n     take part in the formation of a government; the labour and anxiety\r\n     were too great and he repeated more than once emphatically with\r\n     regard to the work of his post, 'No one in the least degree knows\r\n     what it is. I have told the Queen that I part from her with the\r\n     deepest sentiments of gratitude and attachment; but that there is\r\n     one thing she must not ask of me, and that is to place myself again\r\n     in the same position.' Then he spoke of the immense accumulation.\r\n     'There is the whole correspondence with the Queen, several times a\r\n     day, and all requiring to be in my own hand, and to be carefully\r\n     done; the whole correspondence with peers and members of\r\n     parliament, in my own hand, as well as other persons of\r\n     consequence; the sitting seven or eight hours a day to listen in\r\n     the House of Commons. Then I must, of course, have my mind in the\r\n     principal subjects connected with the various departments, such as\r\n     the Oregon question for example, and all the reading connected with\r\n     them. I can hardly tell you, for instance, what trouble the New\r\n     Zealand question gave me. Then there is the difficulty that you\r\n     have in conducting such questions on account of your colleague whom\r\n     they concern.'\r\n\r\n     It was evident from this, as it had been from other signs, that he\r\n     did not think Stanley had been happy in his management of the New\r\n     Zealand question. I said, however, 'I can quite assent to the\r\n     proposition that no one understands the labour of your post; that,\r\n     I think, is all I ever felt I could know about it, that there is\r\n     nothing else like it. But then you have been prime minister in a\r\n     sense in which no other man has been it since Mr. Pitt's time.' He\r\n     said, 'But Mr. Pitt got up every day at eleven o'clock, and drank\r\n     two bottles of port wine every night.' 'And died of old age at\r\n     forty-six,' I replied. 'This all strengthens the case. I grant your\r\n     full and perfect claim to retirement in point of justice and\r\n     reason; if such a claim can be made good by amount of service, I do\r\n     not see how yours could be improved. You have had extraordinary\r\n     physical strength to sustain you; and you have performed an\r\n     extraordinary task. Your government has not been carried on by a\r\n     cabinet, but by the heads of departments each in communication with\r\n     you.' He assented, and added it had been what every government\r\n     ought to be, a government of confidence in one another. 'I have\r\n     felt the utmost confidence as to matters of which I had no\r\n     knowledge, and so have the rest. Lord Aberdeen in particular said\r\n     that nothing would induce him to hold office on any other\r\n     principle, or to be otherwise than perfectly free as to previous\r\n     consultations.' And he spoke of the defects of the Melbourne\r\n     government as a mere government of departments without a centre of\r\n     unity, and of the possibility that the new ministers might\r\n     experience difficulty in the same respect. I then went on to say,\r\n     'Mr. Perceval, Lord Liverpool, Lord Melbourne were not prime\r\n     ministers in this sense; what Mr. Canning might have been, the time\r\n     was too short to show. I fully grant that your labours have been\r\n     incredible, but, allow me to say, that is not the question. The\r\n     question is not whether you are entitled to retire, but whether\r\n     after all you have done, and in the position you occupy before the\r\n     country, you can remain in the House of Commons as an isolated\r\n     person, and hold yourself aloof from the great movements of\r\n     political forces which sway to and fro there?' He said, 'I think\r\n     events will answer that question better than any reasoning\r\n     beforehand.' I replied, 'That is just what I should rely upon, and\r\n     should therefore urge how impossible it is for you to lay down with\r\n     certainty a foregone conclusion such as that which you have\r\n     announced to-day, and which events are not to influence, merely\r\n     that you will remain in parliament and yet separate yourself from\r\n     the parliamentary system by which our government is carried on.'\r\n     Then he said, (If it is necessary I will) 'go out of\r\n     parliament'--the first part of the sentence was indistinctly\r\n     muttered, but the purport such as I have described. To which I\r\n     merely replied that I hoped not, and that the country would have\r\n     something to say upon that too....\r\n\r\n     No man can doubt that he is the strong man of this parliament--of\r\n     this political generation. Then it is asked, Is he honest? But this\r\n     is a question which I think cannot justly be raised nor treated as\r\n     admissible in the smallest degree by those who have known and\r\n     worked with him.... He spoke of the immense multiplication of\r\n     details in public business and the enormous task imposed upon\r\n     available time and strength by the work of attendance in the House\r\n     of Commons. He agreed that it was extremely adverse to the growth\r\n     of greatness among our public men; and he said the mass of public\r\n     business increased so fast that he could not tell what it was to\r\n     end in, and did not venture to speculate even for a few years upon\r\n     the mode of administering public affairs. He thought the\r\n     consequence was already manifest in its being not well done.\r\n\r\n     It sometimes occurred to him whether it would after all be a good\r\n     arrangement to have the prime minister in the House of Lords, which\r\n     would get rid of the very encroaching duty of attendance on and\r\n     correspondence with the Queen. I asked if in that case it would not\r\n     be quite necessary that the leader in the Commons should frequently\r\n     take upon himself to make decisions which ought properly to be\r\n     made by the head of the government? He said, Certainly, and that\r\n     that would constitute a great difficulty. That although Lord\r\n     Melbourne might be very well adapted to take his part in such a\r\n     plan, there were, he believed, difficulties in it under him when\r\n     Lord J. Russell led the House of Commons. That when he led the\r\n     House in 1828 under the Duke of Wellington as premier, he had a\r\n     very great advantage in the disposition of the duke to follow the\r\n     judgments of others in whom he had confidence with respect to all\r\n     civil matters. He said it was impossible during the session even to\r\n     work the public business through the medium of the cabinet, such is\r\n     the pressure upon time.... He told me he had suffered dreadfully in\r\n     his head on the left side--that twenty-two or twenty-three years\r\n     ago he injured the ear by the use of a detonating tube in shooting.\r\n     Since then he had always had a noise on that side, and when he had\r\n     the work of office upon him, this and the pain became scarcely\r\n     bearable at times, as I understood him. Brodie told him that 'as\r\n     some overwork one part and some another, he had overworked his\r\n     brain,' but he said that with this exception his health was good.\r\n     It was pleasant to me to find and feel by actual contact as it were\r\n     (though I had no suspicion of the contrary) his manner as friendly\r\n     and as much unhurt as at any former period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nBefore leaving office Peel wrote to Mr. Gladstone (June 20) requesting\r\nhim to ask his father whether it would be acceptable to him to be\r\nproposed to the Queen for a baronetcy. 'I should name him to the Queen,'\r\nhe said, 'as the honoured representative of a great class of the\r\ncommunity which has raised itself by its integrity and industry to high\r\nsocial eminence. I should gratify also my own feeling by a mark of\r\npersonal respect for a name truly worthy of such illustration as\r\nhereditary honour can confer.' John Gladstone replied in becoming words,\r\nbut honestly mentioned that he had published his strong opinion of the\r\ninjurious consequences that he dreaded from 'the stupendous experiment\r\nabout to be made' in commercial policy. Peel told him that this made no\r\ndifference.[180]\r\n\r\n                         LORD GEORGE BENTINCK\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session a trivial incident occurred that caused Mr.\r\nGladstone a disproportionate amount of vexation for several months. Hume\r\nstated in the House that the colonial secretary had countersigned what\r\nwas a lie, in a royal patent appointing a certain Indian judge. The\r\n'lie' consisted in reciting that a judge then holding the post had\r\nresigned, whereas he had not resigned, and the correct phrase was that\r\nthe Queen had permitted him to retire. Lord George Bentinck, whose rage\r\nwas then at its fiercest, pricked up his ears, and a day or two later\r\ndeclared that Mr. Secretary Gladstone had 'deliberately affirmed, not\r\nthrough any oversight or inadvertence or thoughtlessness, but designedly\r\nand of his own malice prepense, that which in his heart he knew not to\r\nbe true.' Things of this sort may either be passed over in disdain, or\r\ntaken with logician's severity. Mr. Gladstone might well have contented\r\nhimself with the defence that his signature had been purely formal, and\r\nthat every secretary of state is called upon to put his name to recitals\r\nof minute technical fact which he must take on trust from his officials.\r\nAs it was, he chose to take Bentinck's reckless aspersion at its\r\nhighest, and the combat lasted for weeks and months. Bentinck got up the\r\ncase with his usual industrious tenacity; he insisted that the Queen's\r\nname stood at that moment in the degrading position of being prefixed to\r\na proclamation that all her subjects knew to recite and to be founded\r\nupon falsehood; he declared that the whole business was a job\r\nperpetrated by the outgoing ministers, to fill up a post that was not\r\nvacant; he imputed no corrupt motive to Mr. Gladstone; he admitted that\r\nMr. Gladstone was free from the betrayal and treachery practised by his\r\npolitical friends; but he could not acquit him of having been in this\r\nparticular affair the tool and the catspaw of two old foxes greedier and\r\ncraftier than himself. To all this unmannerly stuff the recipient of it\r\nonly replied by holding its author the more tight to the point of the\r\noriginal offence; the blood of his highland ancestors was up, and the\r\npoet's contest between eagle and serpent was not more dire. The affair\r\nwas submitted to Lord Stanley. He reluctantly consented (Oct. 29) to\r\ndecide the single question whether Bentinck was justified 'on the\r\ninformation before him in using the language quoted.' There was a\r\ndispute what information Bentinck had before him, and upon this point,\r\nwhere Bentinck's course might in his own polite vocabulary be marked as\r\npure shuffling, Lord Stanley returned the papers (Feb. 8, 1847) and\r\nexpressed his deep regret that he could bring about no more satisfactory\r\nresult. Even so late as the spring of 1847 Mr. Gladstone was only\r\ndissuaded by the urgent advice of Lord Lincoln and others from pursuing\r\nthe fray. It was, so far as I know, the only personal quarrel into which\r\nhe ever allowed himself to be drawn.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[172] Perhaps I may refer to my _Life of Cobden_, which had the great\r\nadvantage of being read before publication by Mr. Bright. Chapters xiv.\r\nand xv.\r\n\r\n[173] Lord Aberdeen to Senior, Sept. 1856. Mrs. Simpson's _Many\r\nMemories_, p. 233.\r\n\r\n[174] Sibthorp asked Peel in the H. of C. when Gladstone and Lincoln\r\nwould appear. Peel replied that if S. would take the Chiltern Hundreds,\r\nG. should stand against him. S. retorted that the Chiltern Hundreds is a\r\nplace under government, and he would never take place from Peel; but if\r\nP. would dissolve he would welcome Gladstone to Lincoln--or P. himself;\r\nand added privately that he would give P. or G. best bottle of wine in\r\nhis cellar if he would come to Lincoln and fight him fairly.--_Lord\r\nBroughton's Diaries_.\r\n\r\n[175] _Halifax Papers._\r\n\r\n[176] Cobden also wrote to Peel strongly urging him to hold on, and Peel\r\nreplied with an effective defence of his own view. _Life of Cobden_, i.\r\nchap. 18.\r\n\r\n[177] 'There is a name that ought to be associated with the success of\r\nthese measures; it is not the name of Lord John Russell, neither is it\r\nmy name. Sir, the name which ought to be, and will be, associated with\r\nthese measures is the name of a man who, acting from pure and\r\ndisinterested motives, has advocated their cause with untiring energy,\r\nand by appeals to reason expressed by an eloquence the more to be\r\nadmired because it was unaffected and unadorned--the name which ought to\r\nbe associated with the success of these measures is the name of Richard\r\nCobden. Without scruple, Sir, I attribute the success of these measures\r\nto him.'\r\n\r\n[178] See _Life of Lord Lyndhurst_, by Lord Campbell, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[179] Six years later (Nov. 26, 1852), Mr. Gladstone in the House of\r\nCommons said of Cobden, with words of characteristic\r\nqualification:--'Agree you may in his general politics, or you may not;\r\ncomplain you may, if you think you have cause, of the mode and force\r\nwith which in the freedom of debate he commonly states his opinions in\r\nthis House. But it is impossible for us to deny that those benefits of\r\nwhich we are now acknowledging the existence are, in no small part at\r\nany rate, due to the labours in which he has borne so prominent a\r\nshare.'\r\n\r\n[180] Parker, iii. pp. 434-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                      THE TRACTARIAN CATASTROPHE\r\n\r\n                             (_1841-1846_)\r\n\r\n     The movement of 1833 started out oL the anti-Roman feelings of the\r\n     Emancipation time. It was anti-Roman as much as it was\r\n     anti-sectarian and anti-erastian. It was to avert the danger of\r\n     people becoming Romanists from ignorance of church principles. This\r\n     was all changed in one important section of the party. The\r\n     fundamental conceptions were reversed. It was not the Roman church\r\n     but the English church that was put on its trial.... From this\r\n     point of view the object of the movement was no longer to elevate\r\n     and improve an independent English church, but to approximate it as\r\n     far as possible to what was assumed to be undeniable--the perfect\r\n     catholicity of Rome.--DEAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Peel and the break-up of his party in the state coincided\r\npretty nearly with a hardly less memorable rupture in that rising party\r\nin the church, with which Mr. Gladstone had more or less associated\r\nhimself almost from its beginning. Two main centres of authority and\r\nleading in the land were thus at the same moment dislodged and\r\ndispersed. A long struggle in secular concerns had come to a decisive\r\nissue; and the longer struggle in religious concerns had reached a\r\ncritical and menacing stage. The reader will not wonder that two events\r\nso far-reaching as the secession of Newman and the fall of Sir Robert,\r\ncoupled as these public events were with certain importunities of\r\ndomestic circumstance of which I shall have more to say by and by,\r\nbrought Mr. Gladstone to an epoch in his life of extreme perturbation.\r\nRoughly it may be said to extend from 1845 to 1852.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his resignation in the beginning of 1845, he wrote to\r\nLord John Manners, then his colleague at Newark, a curious account of\r\nhis views on party life. Lord John was then acting with the Young\r\nEngland group inspired by Disraeli, who has left a picture of them in\r\n_Sybil_, the most far-seeing of all his novels.\r\n\r\n                         _To Lord John Manners._\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 30, 1845._--You, I have no doubt, are disappointed as to the\r\n     working of a conservative government. And so should I be if I were\r\n     to estimate its results by a comparison with the anticipations\r\n     which, from a distance and in the abstract, I had once entertained\r\n     of political life. But now my expectations not only from this but\r\n     from any government are very small. If they do a little good, if\r\n     they prevent others from doing a good deal of evil, if they\r\n     maintain an unblemished character, it is my fixed conviction that\r\n     under the circumstances of the times I can as an independent member\r\n     of parliament, for I am now virtually such, ask no more. And I do\r\n     entertain the strongest impression that if, with your honourable\r\n     and upright mind, you had been called upon for years to consult as\r\n     one responsible for the movements of great parliamentary bodies, if\r\n     you thus had been accustomed to look into public questions at close\r\n     quarters, your expectations from an administration, and your\r\n     dispositions towards it, would be materially changed....\r\n\r\n     The principles and moral powers of government as such are sinking\r\n     day by day, and it is not by laws and parliaments that they can be\r\n     renovated.... I must venture even one step further, and say that\r\n     such schemes of regeneration as those which were propounded (not, I\r\n     am bound to add, by you) at Manchester,[181] appear to me to be\r\n     most mournful delusions; and their re-issue, for their real\r\n     parentage is elsewhere, from the bosom of the party to which we\r\n     belong, an omen of the worst kind if they were likely to obtain\r\n     currency under the new sanction they have received. It is most easy\r\n     to complain as you do of _laissez-faire_ and _laissez-aller_; nor\r\n     do I in word or in heart presume to blame you; but I should sorely\r\n     blame myself if with my experience and convictions of _the growing\r\n     impotence of government for its highest functions_, I were either\r\n     to recommend attempts beyond its powers, which would react\r\n     unfavourably upon its remaining capabilities, or to be a party to\r\n     proposed substitutes for its true moral and paternal work which\r\n     appear to me mere counterfeits.\r\n\r\n                         RELIGION AT OXFORD\r\n\r\nOn this letter we may note in passing, first, that the tariff\r\nlegislation did in the foundations what the Young England party wished\r\nto do in a superficial and flimsy fashion; and second, it was the tariff\r\nlegislation that drove back a rising tide of socialism, both directly by\r\nvastly improving the condition of labour, and indirectly by force of the\r\ndoctrine of free exchange which was thus corroborated by circumstances.\r\nOf this we shall see more by and by.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years of Sir Robert Peel's government, Mr. Gladstone had\r\nbeen keenly intent upon the progress of religious affairs at Oxford.\r\n'From 1841 till the beginning of 1845,' he says in a fragmentary note,\r\n'I continued a hardworking official man, but with a decided predominance\r\nof religious over secular interests. Although I had little of direct\r\nconnection with Oxford and its teachers, I was regarded in common fame\r\nas tarred with their brush; and I was not so blind as to be unaware that\r\nfor the clergy this meant not yet indeed prosecution, but proscription\r\nand exclusion from advancement by either party in the state, and for\r\nlaymen a vague and indeterminate prejudice with serious doubts how far\r\npersons infected in this particular manner could have any real capacity\r\nfor affairs. Sir Robert Peel must, I think, have exercised much\r\nself-denial when he put me in his cabinet in 1843.' The movement that\r\nbegan in 1833 had by the opening of the next decade revealed startling\r\ntendencies, and its first stage was now slowly but unmistakeably passing\r\ninto the second. Mr. Gladstone has told us[182] how he stood at this\r\nhour of crisis; how strongly he believed that the church of England\r\nwould hold her ground, and even revive the allegiance not only of the\r\nmasses, but of those large and powerful nonconforming bodies who were\r\nsupposed to exist only as a consequence of the neglect of its duties by\r\nthe national church. He has told us also how little he foresaw the\r\nsecond phase of the Oxford movement--the break-up of a distinguished and\r\nimposing generation of clergy; 'the spectacle of some of the most\r\ngifted sons reared by Oxford for the service of the church of England,\r\nhurling at her head the hottest bolts of the Vatican; and along with\r\nthis strange deflexion on one side, a not less convulsive rationalist\r\nmovement on the other,--all ending in contention and estrangement, and\r\nin suspicions worse than either, because less accessible and more\r\nintractable.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe landmarks of the Tractarian story are familiar, and I do not ask the\r\nreader in any detail to retrace them. The publication of Froude's\r\n_Remains_ was the first flagrant beacon lighting the path of divergence\r\nfrom the lines of historical high churchmen in an essentially\r\nanti-protestant direction. Mr. Gladstone read the first instalment of\r\nthis book (1838) 'with repeated regrets.' Then came the blaze kindled by\r\nTract Ninety (1841). This, in the language of its author and his\r\nfriends, was the famous attempt to clear the Articles from the glosses\r\nencrusting them like barnacles, and to bring out the old catholic truth\r\nthat man had done his worst to disfigure and to mutilate, and yet in\r\nspite of all man's endeavour it was in the Articles still. Mr.\r\nGladstone, as we have seen, regarded Tract Ninety with uneasy doubts as\r\nto its drift, its intentions, the way in which the church and the world\r\nwould take it. 'This No. Ninety of _Tracts for the Times_ which I read\r\nby desire of Sir R. Inglis,' he writes to Lord Lyttelton, 'is like a\r\nrepetition of the publication of Froude's _Remains_, and Newman has\r\nagain burned his fingers. The most serious feature in the tract to my\r\nmind is that, doubtless with very honest intentions and with his mind\r\nturned for the moment so entirely towards those inclined to defection,\r\nand therefore occupying _their_ point of view exclusively, he has in\r\nwriting it placed himself quite outside the church of England in point\r\nof spirit and sympathy. As far as regards the proposition for which he\r\nintended mainly to argue, I believe not only that he is right, but that\r\nit is an a b c truth, almost a truism of the reign of Elizabeth, namely\r\nthat the authoritative documents of the church of England were not meant\r\nto bind _all_ men to every opinion of their authors, and particularly\r\nthat they intended to deal as gently with prepossessions thought to look\r\ntowards Rome, as the necessity of securing a certain amount of\r\nreformation would allow. Certainly also the terms in which Newman\r\ncharacterises the present state of the church of England in his\r\nintroduction are calculated to give both pain and alarm; and the whole\r\naspect of the tract is like the assumption of a new position.'\r\n\r\n                        TRACTARIAN LANDMARKS\r\n\r\nNext followed the truly singular struggle for the university chair of\r\npoetry at the end of the same year, between a no-popery candidate and a\r\nPuseyite. Seldom surely has the service of the muses been pressed into\r\nso alien a debate. Mr. Gladstone was cut to the heart at the prospect of\r\na sentence in the shape of a vote for this professorship, passed by the\r\nuniversity of Oxford 'upon all that congeries of opinions which the rude\r\npopular notion associates with the _Tracts for the Times_.' Such a\r\nsentence would be a disavowal by the university of catholic principles\r\nin the gross; the association between catholic principles and the church\r\nof England would be miserably weakened; and those who at all sympathised\r\nwith the Tracts would be placed in the position of aliens, corporally\r\nwithin the pale, but in spirit estranged or outcast. If the church\r\nshould be thus broken up, there would be no space for catholicity\r\nbetween the rival pretensions of an ultra-protestantised or\r\ndecatholicised English church, and the communion of Rome. 'Miserable\r\nchoice!' These and other arguments are strongly pressed (December 3,\r\n1841) in favour of an amicable compromise, in a letter addressed to his\r\nclose friend Frederic Rogers. In the same letter Mr. Gladstone says that\r\nhe cannot profess to understand or to have studied the Tracts on\r\nReserve.[183] He 'partakes perhaps in the popular prejudice against\r\nthem.' Anybody can now see in the coolness of distant time that it was\r\nthese writings on Reserve that roused not merely prejudice but fury in\r\nthe public mind--a fury that without either justice or logic extended\r\nfrom hatred of Romanisers to members of the church of Rome itself. It\r\naffected for the worse the feeling between England and Ireland, for in\r\nthose days to be ultra-protestant was to be anti-Irish; and it greatly\r\naggravated, first the storm about the Maynooth grant in 1845, and then\r\nthe far wilder storm about the papal aggression six years later.\r\n\r\n                      THE JERUSALEM BISHOPRIC\r\n\r\nFurther fuel for excitement was supplied the same year (1841) in a\r\nfantastic project by which a bishop, appointed alternately by Great\r\nBritain and Prussia and with his headquarters at Jerusalem, was to take\r\ncharge through a somewhat miscellaneous region, of any German\r\nprotestants or members of the church of England or anybody else who\r\nmight be disposed to accept his authority. The scheme stirred much\r\nenthusiasm in the religious world, but it deepened alarm among the more\r\nlogical of the high churchmen. Ashley and the evangelicals were keen for\r\nit as the blessed beginning of a restoration of Israel, and the king of\r\nPrussia hoped to gain over the Lutherans and others of his subjects by\r\nthis side-door into true episcopacy. Politics were not absent, and some\r\nhoped that England might find in the new protestant church such an\r\ninstrument in those uncomfortable regions, as Russia possessed in the\r\nGreek church and France in the Latin. Dr. Arnold was delighted at the\r\nthought that the new church at Jerusalem would comprehend persons using\r\ndifferent liturgies and subscribing different articles,--his favourite\r\npattern for the church of England. Pusey at first rather liked the idea\r\nof a bishop to represent the ancient British church in the city of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre; but Newman and Hope, with a keener instinct for their\r\nposition, distrusted the whole design in root and branch as a betrayal\r\nof the church, and Pusey soon came to their mind. With caustic scorn\r\nNewman asked how the anglican church, without ceasing to be a church,\r\ncould become an associate and protector of nestorians, jacobites,\r\nmonophysites, and all the heretics one could hear of, and even form a\r\nsort of league with the mussulman against the Greek orthodox and the\r\nLatin catholics. Mr. Gladstone could not be drawn to go these lengths.\r\nNobody could be more of a logician than Mr. Gladstone when he liked, no\r\nlogician could wield a more trenchant blade; but nobody ever knew better\r\nin complex circumstance the perils of the logical short cut. Hence,\r\naccording to his general manner in all dubious cases, he moved slowly,\r\nand laboured to remove practical grounds for objection. Ashley describes\r\nhim (October 16) at a dinner at Bunsen's rejoicing in the bishopric, and\r\nproposing the health of the new prelate, and this gave Ashley pleasure,\r\nfor 'Gladstone is a good man and a clever man and an industrious\r\nman.'[184] While resolute against any plan for what Hope called\r\ngathering up the scraps of Christendom and making a new church out of\r\nthem, and resolute against what he himself called the inauguration of an\r\nexperimental or fancy church, Mr. Gladstone declared himself ready 'to\r\nbrave misconstruction for the sake of union with any Christian men,\r\nprovided the terms of union were not contrary to sound principles.' With\r\na strenuous patience that was thoroughly characteristic, he set to work\r\nto bring the details of the scheme into an order conformable to his own\r\nviews, and he even became a trustee of the endowment fund. Two bishops\r\nin succession filled the see, but in the fulness of time most men agreed\r\nwith Newman, who 'never heard of any either good or harm that bishopric\r\nhad ever done,' except what it had done for him. To him it gave a final\r\nshake, and brought him on to the beginning of the end.[185]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1842 Mr. Gladstone received confidences that amazed\r\nhim. Here is a passage from his diary:--\r\n\r\n     _July 31, 1842._--Walk with R. Williams to converse on the subject\r\n     of our recent letters. I made it my object to learn from him the\r\n     general view of the ulterior section of the Oxford writers and\r\n     their friends. It is startling. They look not merely to the renewal\r\n     and development of the catholic idea within the pale of the church\r\n     of England, but seem to consider the main condition of that\r\n     development and of all health (some tending even to say of all\r\n     life) to be reunion with the church, of Rome as the see of Peter.\r\n     They recognise, however, authority in the church of England, and\r\n     abide in her without love specifically fixed upon her, to seek the\r\n     fulfilment of this work of reunion. It is, for example, he said,\r\n     the sole object of Oakeley's life. They do not look to any defined\r\n     order of proceedings in the way of means. They consider that the\r\n     end is to be reached through catholicising the mind of the members\r\n     of the church of England, but do not seem to feel that this can be\r\n     done to any great degree in working out and giving free scope to\r\n     her own rubrical system. They have no strong feeling of revulsion\r\n     from actual evils in the church of Rome, first, because they do not\r\n     wish to judge; secondly, especially not to judge the saints;\r\n     thirdly, they consider that infallibility is somewhere and nowhere\r\n     but there. They could not remain in the church of England if they\r\n     thought that she dogmatically condemned anything that the church of\r\n     Rome has defined _de fide_, but they do and will remain on the\r\n     basis of the argument of Tract 90; upon which, after mental\r\n     conflict, they have settled steadily down. They regret what Newman\r\n     has said strongly against the actual system of the church of Rome,\r\n     and they could not have affirmed, though neither do they positively\r\n     deny it. Wherever Roman doctrine _de fide_ is oppugned they must\r\n     protest; but short of this they render absolute obedience to their\r\n     ecclesiastical superiors in the church of England. They expect to\r\n     work on in practical harmony with those who look mainly to the\r\n     restoration of catholic ideas on the foundation laid by the church\r\n     of England as reformed, and who take a different view as to reunion\r\n     with Rome in particular, though of course desiring the reunion of\r\n     the whole body of Christ. All this is matter for very serious\r\n     consideration. In the meantime I was anxious to put it down while\r\n     fresh.\r\n\r\n                           POSITION OF NEWMAN\r\n\r\nNow was the time at which Mr. Gladstone's relations with Manning and\r\nHope began to approach their closest. Newman, the great enchanter, in\r\nobedience to his bishop had dropped the issue of the Tracts; had\r\nwithdrawn from all public discussion of ecclesiastical politics; had\r\ngiven up his work in Oxford; and had retired with a neophyte or two to\r\nLittlemore, a hamlet on the outskirts of the ever venerable city, there\r\nto pursue his theological studies, to prepare translations of\r\nAthanasius, to attend to his little parish, and generally to go about\r\nhis own business so far as he might be permitted by the restlessness\r\nalike of unprovoked opponents and unsought disciples. This was the\r\nautumn of 1843. In October Manning sent to Mr. Gladstone two letters\r\nthat he had received from Newman, indicating only too plainly, as they\r\nwere both convinced, that the foundations of their leader's anglicanism\r\nhad been totally undermined by the sweeping repudiation alike by\r\nepiscopal and university authority of the doctrines of Tract Ninety. Dr.\r\nPusey, on the other hand, admitted that the expressions in Newman's\r\nletter were portentous, but did not believe that they necessarily meant\r\nsecession. In a man of the world this would not have been regarded as\r\ncandid. For Newman says, 'I formally told Pusey that I expected to leave\r\nthe church of England in the autumn of 1843, and begged him to tell\r\nothers, that no one might be taken by surprise or might trust me in the\r\ninterval.'[186] But Newman has told us that he had from the first great\r\ndifficulty in making Dr. Pusey understand the differences between them.\r\nThe letters stand in the _Apologia_ (chapter iv. Sec. 2) to tell their own\r\ntale. To Mr. Gladstone their shock was extreme, not only by reason of\r\nthe catastrophe to which they pointed, but from the ill-omened shadow\r\nthat they threw upon the writer's probity of mind if not of heart. 'I\r\nstagger to and fro like a drunken man,' he wrote to Manning, 'I am at my\r\nwit's end.' He found some of Newman's language, 'forgive me if I say it,\r\nmore like the expressions of some Faust gambling for his soul, than the\r\nrecords of the inner life of a great Christian teacher.' In his diary,\r\nhe puts it thus:--\r\n\r\n     _Oct. 28, 1843._--S. Simon and S. Jude. St. James's 11 A.M. with a\r\n     heavy heart. Another letter had come from Manning, enclosing a\r\n     second from Newman, which announced that since the summer of 1839\r\n     he had had the conviction that the church of Rome is the catholic\r\n     church, and ours not a branch of the catholic church because not in\r\n     communion with Rome; that he had resigned St. Mary's because he\r\n     felt he could not with a safe conscience longer teach in her; that\r\n     by the article in the _British Critic_ on the catholicity of the\r\n     English church he had quieted his mind for two years; that in his\r\n     letter to the Bishop of Oxford, written most reluctantly, he, as\r\n     the best course under the circumstances, committed himself again;\r\n     that his alarms revived with that wretched affair of the Jerusalem\r\n     bishopric, and had increased ever since; that Manning's\r\n     interference had only made him the more realise his views; that\r\n     Manning might make what use he pleased of his letters; he was\r\n     relieved of a heavy heart; yet he trusted that God would beep him\r\n     from hasty steps and resolves with a doubting conscience! How are\r\n     the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished!\r\n\r\nWith the characteristic spirit with which, in politics and in every\r\nother field, he always insisted on espying patches of blue sky where\r\nothers saw unbroken cloud, he was amazed that Newman did not, in spite\r\nof all the pranks of the Oxford heads, perceive the English church to be\r\ngrowing in her members more catholic from year to year, and how much\r\nmore plain and undeniable was the sway of catholic principles within its\r\nbounds, since the time when he entertained no shadow of doubt about it.\r\nBut while repeating his opinion that in many of the Tracts the language\r\nabout the Roman church had often been far too censorious, Mr. Gladstone\r\ndoes not, nor did he ever, shrink from designating conversion to that\r\nchurch by the unflinching names of lapse and fall.[187] As he was soon\r\nto put it, 'The temptation towards the church of Rome of which some are\r\nconscious, has never been before my mind in any other sense than as\r\nother plain and flagrant sins have been before it.'[188]\r\n\r\nTwo days later he wrote to Manning again:--\r\n\r\n      _Oct. 30, 1843._-- ... I have still to say that my impressions,\r\n     though without more opportunity of testing them I cannot regard\r\n     them as final, are still and strongly to the effect that upon the\r\n     promulgation of those two letters to the world. Newman stands in\r\n     the general view a _disgraced man_--and all men, all principles,\r\n     with which he has had to do, disgraced in proportion to the\r\n     proximity of their connection. And further I am persuaded that were\r\n     he not spellbound and entranced, he could not fail to see the gross\r\n     moral incoherence of the parts of his two statements; and that were\r\n     I upon the terms which would warrant it, I should feel it my duty,\r\n     at a time when as now, _summa res agitur_, to tell him so, after\r\n     having, however, tried my own views by reference to some other\r\n     mind, for instance to your own. But surely it will be said that his\r\n     'committing himself again' was simply a deliberate protestation of\r\n     what he knew to be untrue. I have no doubt of his having proceeded\r\n     honestly; no doubt that he can show it; but I say that those two\r\n     letters are quite enough to condemn a man in whom one has no\r\n     [Greek: pistis ethike]: much more then one whom a great majority of the\r\n     community regard with prejudice and deep suspicion.... With regard\r\n     to your own feelings believe me that I enter into them; and indeed\r\n     our communications have now for many years been too warm, free, and\r\n     confiding to make it necessary for me, as I trust, to say what a\r\n     resource and privilege it is to me to take counsel with you upon\r\n     those absorbing subjects and upon the fortunes of the church; to\r\n     which I desire to feel with you that life, strength, and all means\r\n     and faculties, ought freely to be devoted, and indeed from such\r\n     devotion alone can they derive anything of true value.[189]\r\n\r\n                             WARD'S _IDEAL_\r\n\r\nThe next blow was struck in the summer of 1844 by Ward's _Ideal of a\r\nChristian Church_, which had the remarkable effect of harassing and\r\nafflicting all the three high camps--the historical anglicans, the\r\nPuseyites and moderate tractarians, and finally the Newmanites and\r\nmoderate Romanisers.[190] The writer was one of the most powerful\r\ndialecticians of the day, defiant, aggressive, implacable in his\r\nlogic, unflinching in any stand that he chose to take; the\r\nmaster-representative of tactics and a temper like those to which Laud\r\nand Strafford gave the pungent name of Thorough. It was not its\r\ntheology, still less its history, that made his book the signal for the\r\nexplosion; it was his audacious proclamation that the whole cycle of\r\nRoman doctrine was gradually possessing numbers of English churchmen,\r\nand that he himself, a clergyman in orders and holding his fellowship on\r\nthe tenure of church subscription, had in so subscribing to the Articles\r\nrenounced no single Roman doctrine. This, and not the six hundred pages\r\nof argumentation, was the ringing challenge that provoked a plain issue,\r\nprecipitated a decisive struggle, and brought the first stage of\r\ntractarianism to a close.\r\n\r\n                             ARTICLE ON WARD\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that Mr. Gladstone even in the thick of his tariffs,\r\nhis committees and deputations, his cabinet duties, and all the other\r\nabsorbing occupations of an important minister in strong harness, should\r\nlet a publication, in his view so injurious, pass in silence.[191] With\r\nindignation he flew to his intrepid pen, and dealt as trenchantly with\r\nWard as Ward himself had dealt trenchantly with the reformers and all\r\nothers whom he found planted in his dialectic way. Mr. Gladstone held\r\nthe book up to stringent reproof for its capricious injustice; for the\r\ntriviality of its investigations of fact; for the savageness of its\r\ncensures; for the wild and wanton opinions broached in its pages; for\r\nthe infatuation of mind manifested in some of its arguments; and for the\r\nlamentable circumstance that it exhibited a far greater debt in mental\r\nculture to Mr. John Stuart Mill than to the whole range of Christian\r\ndivines. In a sentence, Ward 'had launched on the great deep of human\r\ncontroversy as frail a bark as ever carried sail,' and his reviewer\r\nundoubtedly let loose upon it as shrewd a blast as ever blew from the\r\nAEolian wallet. The article was meant for the _Quarterly Review_, and it\r\nis easy to imagine the dire perplexities of Lockhart's editorial mind in\r\ntimes so fervid and so distracted. The practical issue after all was not\r\nthe merits or the demerits of Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, nor the real\r\nmeaning of Hooker, Jewel, Bull, but simply what was to be done to Ward.\r\nLockhart wrote to Murray that he had very seriously studied the article\r\nand studied Ward's book, and not only these, but also the Articles and\r\nthe canons of the church, and he could not approve of the _Review_\r\ncommitting itself to a judgment on the line proper to be taken by the\r\nauthorities of church and university, and the expression of such a\r\njudgment he suspected to be Mr. Gladstone's main object in writing. Mr.\r\nGladstone, describing himself most truly as 'one of those soldiers who\r\ndo not know when they are beat,' saw his editor; declared that what he\r\nsought was three things, first, that the process of mobbing out by\r\ninvective and private interpretations is bad and should be stopped;\r\nsecond, that the church of England does not make assent to the\r\nproceedings of the Reformation a term of communion; and third, that\r\nbefore even judicial proceedings in one direction, due consideration\r\nshould be had of what judicial proceedings in another direction\r\nconsistency might entail, if that game were once begun. As Ward himself\r\nhad virtually put it, 'Show me how any of the recognised parties in the\r\nchurch can subscribe in a natural sense, before you condemn me for\r\nsubscribing in a non-natural.'[192] The end was a concordat between\r\neditor and contributor, followed by an immense amount of irksome\r\nrevision, mutilation, and re-revision, reducing the argument in some\r\nplaces 'almost to tatters'; but the writer was in the long run satisfied\r\nthat things were left standing in it which it was well to plant in a\r\nperiodical like the _Quarterly Review_.\r\n\r\nWe have a glimpse of the passionate agitation into which this great\r\ncontroversy, partly theologic, partly moral, threw Mr. Gladstone:--\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 6._--Breakfast at Mr. Macaulay's. Conversation chiefly on\r\n     Aristotle's politics and on the Oxford proceedings. I grew hot, for\r\n     which _ignoscat Deus_. _Feb. 13._--Oxford 1-5. We were in the\r\n     theatre. Ward was like himself, honest to a fault, as little like\r\n     an advocate in his line of argument as well could he, and strained\r\n     his theology even a point further than before. The forms are\r\n     venerable, the sight imposing; the act is fearful [the degradation\r\n     of Ward], if it did not leave strong hope of its revisal by law.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Pusey he writes (Feb. 7):--\r\n\r\n     Indignation at this proposal to treat Mr. Newman worse than a dog\r\n     really makes me mistrust my judgment, as I suppose one should\r\n     always do when any proposal seeming to present an aspect of\r\n     incredible wickedness is advanced. _Feb. 17._--I concur with my\r\n     whole heart and soul in the desire for repose; and I fully believe\r\n     that the gift of an interval of reflection is that which would be\r\n     of all gifts the most precious to us all, which would restore the\r\n     faculty of deliberation now almost lost in storms, and would afford\r\n     the best hope both of the development of the soundest elements that\r\n     are in motion amongst us, and of the mitigation or absorption of\r\n     those which are more dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings at Oxford against Ward (February 13, 1845), Mr.\r\nGladstone voted in the minority both against the condemnation of the\r\nbook, and against the proposal to strip its writer of his university\r\ndegree. He held that the censure combined condemnation of opinions with\r\na declaration of personal dishonesty, and the latter question he held to\r\nbe one 'not fit for the adjudication of a human tribunal.'\r\n\r\nAll this has a marked place in Mr. Gladstone's mental progress. Though\r\nprimarily and ostensibly the concern of the established church, yet the\r\nseries of proceedings that had begun with the attack on Hampden in 1836,\r\nand then were followed down to our own day by academical, ecclesiastical\r\nand legal censures and penalties, or attempts at censure and penalty, on\r\nNewman, Pusey, Maurice, Gorham, _Essays and Reviews_, Colenso, and\r\nended, if they have yet ended, in a host of judgments affecting minor\r\npersonages almost as good as nameless--all constitute a chapter of\r\nextraordinary importance in the general history of English toleration,\r\nextending in its consequences far beyond the pale of the communion\r\nimmediately concerned. It was a long and painful journey, often\r\nunedifying, not seldom squalid, with crooked turns not a few, and before\r\nit was over, casting men into strange companionship upon bleak and\r\nhazardous shores. Mr. Gladstone, though he probably was not one of those\r\nwho are as if born by nature tolerant, was soon drawn by circumstance to\r\nlook with favour upon that particular sort of toleration which arose\r\nout of the need for comprehension. When the six doctors condemned Pusey\r\n(June 1843) for preaching heresy and punished him by suspension, Mr.\r\nGladstone was one of those who signed a vigorous protest against a\r\nverdict and a sentence passed upon an offender without hearing him and\r\nwithout stating reasons. This was at least the good beginning of an\r\neducation in liberal rudiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                            NEWMAN'S SECESSION\r\n\r\nIn October 1845 the earthquake came. Newman was received into the Roman\r\ncommunion. Of this step Mr. Gladstone said that it has never yet been\r\nestimated at anything like the full amount of its calamitous importance.\r\nThe leader who had wielded a magician's power in Oxford was followed by\r\na host of other converts. More than once I have heard Mr. Gladstone tell\r\nthe story how about this time he sought from Manning an answer to the\r\nquestion that sorely perplexed him: what was the common bond of union\r\nthat led men of intellect so different, of character so opposite, of\r\nsuch various circumstance, to come to the same conclusion. Manning's\r\nanswer was slow and deliberate: '_Their common bond is their want of\r\ntruth._' 'I was surprised beyond measure,' Mr. Gladstone would proceed,\r\n'and startled at his judgment.'[193]\r\n\r\nMost ordinary churchmen remained where they were. An erastian statesman\r\nof our own time, when alarmists ran to him with the news that a couple\r\nof noblemen and their wives had just gone over to Rome, replied with\r\ncalm, 'Show me a couple of grocers and their wives who have gone over,\r\nthen you will frighten me.' The great body of church people stood firm,\r\nand so did Pusey, Keble, Gladstone, and so too, for half a dozen years\r\nto come, did his two closest friends, Manning and Hope. The dominant\r\nnote in Mr. Gladstone's mind was clear and it was constant. As he put it\r\nto Manning (August 1,1845),--'That one should entertain love for the\r\nchurch of Rome in respect of her virtues and her glories, is of course\r\nright and obligatory; but one is equally bound under the circumstances\r\nof the English church in direct antagonism with Rome to keep clearly in\r\nview their very fearful opposites.'\r\n\r\nTidings of the great secession happened to find Mr. Gladstone in a\r\nrather singular atmosphere. In the course of 1842, to the keen distress\r\nof her relatives, his sister had joined the Roman church, and her\r\nsomewhat peculiar nature led to difficulties that taxed patience and\r\nresource to the uttermost. She had feelings of warm attachment to her\r\nbrother, and spoke strongly in that sense to Dr. Wiseman; and it was for\r\nthe purpose of carrying out some plans of his father's for her\r\nadvantage, that in the autumn of 1845 (September 24-November 18), Mr.\r\nGladstone passed nearly a couple of months in Germany. The duty was\r\nheavy and dismal, but the journey brought him into a society that could\r\nnot be without effect upon his impressionable mind. At Munich he laid\r\nthe foundation of one of the most interesting and cherished friendships\r\nof his life. Hope-Scott had already made the acquaintance of Dr.\r\nDoellinger, and he now begged Mr. Gladstone on no account to fail to\r\npresent himself to him, as well as to other learned and political men,\r\n'good catholics and good men with no ordinary talent and information.'\r\n'Nothing,' Mr. Gladstone once wrote in after years, 'ever so much made\r\nme anglican _versus_ Roman as reading in Doellinger over forty years ago\r\nthe history of the fourth century and Athanasius _contra mundum_.' Here\r\nis his story to his wife:--\r\n\r\n     _Munich, Sept. 30, 1845._--Yesterday evening after dinner with two\r\n     travelling companions, an Italian _negoziante_ and a German, I must\r\n     needs go and have a shilling's worth of the Augsburg Opera, where\r\n     we heard Mozart (_Don Juan_) _well_ played and very respectably\r\n     sung. To-day I have spent my evening differently, in tea and\r\n     infinite conversation with Dr. Doellinger, who is one of the first\r\n     among the Roman catholic theologians of Germany, a remarkable and a\r\n     very pleasing man. His manners have great simplicity and I am\r\n     astonished at the way in which a busy student such as he is can\r\n     receive an intruder. His appearance is, singular to say, just\r\n     compounded of those of two men who are among the most striking in\r\n     appearance of our clergy, Newman and Dr. Mill. He surprises me by\r\n     the extent of his information and the way in which he knows the\r\n     details of what takes place in England. Most of our conversation\r\n     related to it. He seemed to me one of the most liberal and catholic\r\n     in mind of all the persons of his communion whom I have known.\r\n     To-morrow I am to have tea with him again, and there is to be a\r\n     third, Dr. Goerres, who is a man of eminence among them. Do not\r\n     think he has designs upon me. Indeed he disarms my suspicions in\r\n     that respect by what appears to me a great sincerity....\r\n\r\n                               DR. DOeLLINGER\r\n\r\n     _Oct. 2._--On Tuesday after post I began to look about me; and\r\n     though I have not seen all the sights of Munich I have certainly\r\n     seen a great deal that is interesting in the way of art, and having\r\n     spent a good deal of time in Dr. Doellinger's company, last night\r\n     till one o'clock, I have lost my heart to him. What I like perhaps\r\n     most, or what crowns other causes of liking towards him, is that\r\n     he, like Rio, seems to take hearty interest in the progress of\r\n     religion in the church of England, apart from the (so to speak)\r\n     party question between us, and to have a mind to appreciate good\r\n     wherever he can find it. For instance, when in speaking of Wesley I\r\n     said that his own views and intuitions were not heretical, and that\r\n     if the ruling power in our church had had energy and a right mind\r\n     to turn him to account, or if he had been in the church of Rome I\r\n     was about to add, he would then have been a great saint, or\r\n     something to that effect. But I hesitated, thinking it perhaps too\r\n     strong, and even presumptuous, but he took me up and used the very\r\n     words, declaring that to be his opinion. Again, speaking of\r\n     Archbishop Leighton he expressed great admiration of his piety, and\r\n     said it was so striking that he could not have been a real\r\n     Calvinist. He is a great admirer of England and English character,\r\n     and he does not at all _slur_ over the mischief with which religion\r\n     has to contend in Germany. Lastly, I may be wrong, but I am\r\n     persuaded he in his mind abhors a great deal that is too frequently\r\n     taught in the church of Rome. Last night he spoke with such a\r\n     sentiment of the doctrine that was taught on the subject of\r\n     indulgences which moved Luther to resist them; and he said he\r\n     believed it was true that the preachers represented to the people\r\n     that by money payments they could procure the release souls from\r\n     purgatory. I told him that was exactly the doctrine I had heard\r\n     preached in Messina, and he said a priest preaching so in Germany\r\n     would be suspended by his bishop.\r\n\r\n     Last night he invited several of his friends whom I wanted to meet,\r\n     to an entertainment which consisted first of weak tea, immediately\r\n     followed by meat supper with beer and wine and sweets. For two\r\n     hours was I there in the midst of five German professors, or four,\r\n     and the editor of a paper, who held very interesting discussions; I\r\n     could only follow them in part, and enter into them still less, as\r\n     none of them (except Dr. D.) seemed to speak any tongue but their\r\n     own with any freedom, but you would have been amused to see and\r\n     hear them, and me in the midst. I never saw men who spoke together\r\n     in a way to make one another inaudible as they did, always\r\n     excepting Dr. Doellinger, who sat like Rogers, being as he is a much\r\n     more refined man than the rest. But of the others I assure you\r\n     always two, sometimes three, and once all four, were speaking at\r\n     once, very loud, each not trying to force the attention of the\r\n     others, but to be following the current of his own thoughts. One of\r\n     them was Dr. Goerres,[194] who in the time of Napoleon edited a\r\n     journal that had a great effect in rousing Germany to arms.\r\n     Unfortunately he spoke more _thickly_ than any of them.[195]\r\n\r\n     At Baden-Baden (October 16) he made the acquaintance of Mrs.\r\n     Craven, the wife of the secretary of the Stuttgart mission, and\r\n     authoress of the _Recit d'une Soeur_. Some of the personages of that\r\n     alluring book were of the company. 'I have drunk tea several times\r\n     at her house, and have had two or three long conversations with\r\n     them on matters of religion. They are excessively acute and also\r\n     full of Christian sentiment. But they are much more difficult to\r\n     make real way with than a professor of theology, because they are\r\n     determined (what is vulgarly called) to go the whole hog, just as\r\n     in England usually when you find a woman anti-popish in spirit,\r\n     she will push the argument against them to all extremes.'\r\n\r\n                               FURTHER ADVANCE\r\n\r\n     It was at the same time that he read Bunsen's book on the church.\r\n     'It is dismal,' he wrote home to Mrs. Gladstone, 'and I must write\r\n     to him to say so as kindly as I can.' Bunsen would seem all the\r\n     more dismal from the contrast with the spiritual graces of these\r\n     catholic ladies, and the ripe thinking and massive learning of one\r\n     who was still the great catholic doctor. At no time in Mr.\r\n     Gladstone's letters to Manning or to Hope is there a single\r\n     faltering accent in respect of Rome. The question is not for an\r\n     instant, or in any of his moods, open. He never doubts nor wavers.\r\n     None the less, these impressions of his German journey would rather\r\n     confirm than weaken his theological faith within the boundaries of\r\n     anglican form and institution. 'With my whole soul I am convinced,'\r\n     he says to Manning (June 23, 1850), 'that if the Roman system is\r\n     incapable of being powerfully modified in spirit, it never can be\r\n     the instrument of the work of God among us; the faults and the\r\n     virtues of England are alike against it.'\r\n\r\n                           THE LADY HEWLEY CASE\r\n\r\nI need spend no time in pointing out how inevitably these new currents\r\ndrew Mr. Gladstone away from the old moorings of his first book. Even in\r\n1844 he had parted company with the high ecclesiastical principles of\r\ngood tories like Sir Robert Inglis. Peel, to his great honour, in that\r\nyear brought in what Macaulay truly called 'an honest, an excellent\r\nbill, introduced from none but the best and purest motives.' It arose\r\nfrom a judicial decision in what was known as the Lady Hewley case, and\r\nits object was nothing more revolutionary or latitudinarian than to\r\napply to Unitarian chapels the same principle of prescription that\r\nprotected gentlemen in the peaceful enjoyment of their estates and their\r\nmanor-houses. The equity of the thing was obvious. In 1779 parliament\r\nhad relieved protestant dissenting ministers from the necessity of\r\ndeclaring their belief in certain church articles, including especially\r\nthose affecting the doctrine of the Trinity. In 1813 parliament had\r\nrepealed the act of William III. that made it blasphemy to deny that\r\ndoctrine. This legislation, rendered Unitarian foundations legal, and\r\nthe bill extended to unitarian congregations the same prescriptions as\r\ncovered the titles of other voluntary bodies to their places of worship,\r\ntheir school-houses, and their burial-grounds. But what was thus a\r\nquestion of property was treated as if it were a question of divinity;\r\n'bigotry sought aid from chicane,' and a tremendous clamour was raised\r\nby anglicans, wesleyans, presbyterians, not because they had an inch of\r\n_locus standi_ in the business, but because unitarianism was scandalous\r\nheresy and sin. Follett made a masterly lawyer's speech, Sheil the\r\nspeech of a glittering orator, guarding unitarians by the arguments that\r\nhad (or perhaps I should say had not) guarded Irish catholics, Peel and\r\nGladstone made political speeches lofty and sound, and Macaulay the\r\nspeech of an eloquent scholar and a reasoner, manfully enforcing\r\nprinciples both of law and justice with a luxuriance of illustration all\r\nhis own, from jurists of imperial Rome, sages of old Greece, Hindoos,\r\nPeruvians, Mexicans, and tribunals beyond the Mississippi.[196] We do\r\nnot often enjoy such parliamentary nights in our time.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone supported the proposal on the broadest grounds of\r\nunrestricted private judgment:--\r\n\r\n     I went into the subject laboriously, he says, and satisfied myself\r\n     that this was not to be viewed as a mere quieting of titles based\r\n     on lapse of time, but that the unitarians were the true lawful\r\n     holders, because though they did not agree with the puritan\r\n     opinions they adhered firmly to the puritan principle, which was\r\n     that scripture was the rule without any binding interpretation, and\r\n     that each man, or body, or generation must interpret for himself.\r\n     This measure in some ways heightened my churchmanship, but\r\n     depressed my church-and-statesmanship.\r\n\r\nFar from feeling that there was any contrariety between his principles\r\nof religious belief and those on which legislation in their case ought\r\nto proceed, he said that the only use he could make of these principles\r\nwas to apply them to the decisive performance of a great and important\r\nact, founded on the everlasting principles of truth and justice. Sheil,\r\nwho followed Mr. Gladstone, made a decidedly striking observation. He\r\ndeclared how delighted he was to hear from such high authority that the\r\nbill was perfectly reconcilable with the strictest and the sternest\r\nprinciples of state conscience. 'I cannot doubt,' he continued, 'that\r\nthe right hon. gentleman, the champion of free trade, will ere long\r\nbecome the advocate of the most unrestricted liberty of thought.' Time\r\nwas to justify Sheil's acute prediction. Unquestionably the line of\r\nargument that suggested it was a great advance from the arguments of\r\n1838, of which Macaulay had said that they would warrant the roasting of\r\ndissenters at slow fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nIn this vast field of human interest what engaged and inflamed him was\r\nnot in the main place that solicitude for personal salvation and\r\nsanctification, which under sharp stress of argument, of pious\r\nsensibility, of spiritual panic, now sent so many flocking into the\r\nRoman fold. It was at bottom more like the passion of the great popes\r\nand ecclesiastical master-builders, for strengthening and extending the\r\ninstitutions by which faith is spread, its lamps trimmed afresh, its\r\npurity secured. What wrung him with affliction was the laying waste of\r\nthe heritage of the Lord. 'The promise,' he cried, 'indeed stands sure\r\nto the church and the elect. In the farthest distance there is peace,\r\ntruth, glory; but what a leap to it, over what a gulf.' For himself, the\r\nold dilemma of his early years still tormented him. 'I wish,' he writes\r\nto Manning (March 8, 1846) good humouredly, 'I could get a synodical\r\ndecision in favour of my retirement from public life. For, I profess to\r\nremain there (to myself) for the service of the church, and my views of\r\nthe mode of serving her are getting so fearfully wide of those generally\r\ncurrent, that even if they be sound, they may become wholly\r\nunavailable.' The question whether the service of the church can be most\r\neffectually performed in parliament was incessantly present to his mind.\r\nManning pressed him in one direction, the inward voice drew him in the\r\nother. 'I could write down in a few lines,' he says to Manning, 'the\r\nmeasures, after the adoption of which I should be prepared to say to a\r\nyoung man entering life, If you wish to serve the church do it in the\r\nsanctuary, and not in parliament (unless he were otherwise determined by\r\nhis station, and not always then; it must depend upon his inward\r\nvocation), and should not think it at all absurd to say the same thing\r\nto some who have already placed themselves in this latter sphere. For\r\nwhen the end is attained of letting \"the church help herself,\" and when\r\nit is recognised that active help can no longer be given, the function\r\nof serving the church in the state, such as it was according to the old\r\nidea, dies of itself, and what remains of duty is of a character\r\nessentially different.' Then a pregnant passage:--'It is the essential\r\nchange now in progress from the catholic to the infidel idea of the\r\nstate which is the determining element in my estimate of this matter,\r\nand which has, I think, no place in yours. For I hold and believe that\r\nwhen that transition has once been effected, the state never can come\r\nback to the catholic idea by means of any agency from within itself:\r\nthat, if at all, it must be by a sort of re-conversion from without. I\r\nam not of those (excellent as I think them) who say, Remain and bear\r\nwitness for the truth. There is a place where witness is ever to be\r\nborne for truth, that is to say for full and absolute truth, but it is\r\nnot there.'[197]\r\n\r\nHe reproaches himself with being 'actively engaged in carrying on a\r\nprocess of, lowering the religious tone of the state, letting it down,\r\ndemoralising it, and assisting in its transition into one which is\r\nmechanical.' The objects that warrant public life in one in whose case\r\nexecutive government must be an element, must be very special. True that\r\nin all probability the church will hold her nationality in substance\r\nbeyond our day. 'I think she will hold it as long as the monarchy\r\nsubsists.' So long the church will need parliamentary defence, but in\r\nwhat form? The dissenters had no members for universities, and yet their\r\nreal representation was far better organised in proportion to its weight\r\nthan the church, though formally not organised at all. 'Strength with\r\nthe people will for our day at least be the only effectual defence of\r\nthe church in the House of Commons, as the want of it is now our\r\nweakness there. It is not everything that calls itself a defence that is\r\nreally such.'[198]\r\n\r\n                        HOPES FOR THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nManning expressed a strong fear, amounting almost to a belief, that the\r\nchurch of England must split asunder. 'Nothing can be firmer in my\r\nmind,' Mr. Gladstone replied (Aug. 31, 1846), 'than the opposite idea.\r\nShe will live through her struggles, she has a great providential\r\ndestiny before her. Recollect that for a century and a half, a much\r\nlonger period than any for which puritan and catholic principles have\r\nbeen in conflict within the church of England, Jansenist and\r\nanti-Jansenist dwelt within the church of Rome with the unity of wolf\r\nand lamb. Their differences were not absorbed by the force of the\r\nchurch; they were in full vigour when the Revolution burst upon both.\r\nThen the breach between nation and church became so wide as to make the\r\nrivalries of the two church sections insignificant, and so to cause\r\ntheir fusion.' Later, he thinks that he finds a truer analogy between\r\n'the superstition and idolatry that gnaws and corrodes' the life of the\r\nRoman church, and the puritanism that with at least as much countenance\r\nfrom authority abides in the English church. There are two systems, he\r\nsays, in the English church vitally opposed to one another, and if they\r\nwere equally developed they could not subsist together in the same\r\nsphere. If puritanical doctrines were the base of episcopal and\r\ncollegiate teaching, then the church must either split or become\r\nheretical. As it is, the basis is on the whole anti-puritanic, and what\r\nwe should call catholic. The conflict may go on as now, and with a\r\nprogressive advance of the good principle against the bad one. 'That has\r\nbeen on the whole the course of things during our lifetime, and to judge\r\nfrom present signs it is the will of God that it should so continue.'\r\n(Dec. 7, 1846.)\r\n\r\nThe following to Mr. Phillimore sums up the case as he then believed it\r\nto stand (June 24, 1847):--\r\n\r\n     ... The church is now in a condition in which her children may and\r\n     must desire that she should keep her national position and her\r\n     civil and proprietary rights, and that she should by degrees obtain\r\n     the means of extending and of strengthening herself, not only by\r\n     covering a greater space, but by a more vigorous organisation. Her\r\n     attaining to this state of higher health depends in no small degree\r\n     upon progressive adaptations of her state and her laws to her ever\r\n     enlarging exigencies; these depend upon the humour of the state,\r\n     and the state cannot and will not be in good humour with her, if\r\n     she insists upon its being in bad humour with all other communions.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me, therefore, that while in substance we should all\r\n     strive to sustain her in her national position, we shall do well on\r\n     her behalf to follow these rules: to part earlier, and more freely\r\n     and cordially, than heretofore with such of her privileges, here\r\n     and there, as may be more obnoxious than really valuable, and some\r\n     such she has; and further, not to presume too much to give\r\n     directions to the state as to its policy with respect to other\r\n     religious bodies.... This is not political expediency as opposed to\r\n     religious principle. Nothing did so much damage to religion as the\r\n     obstinate adherence to a negative, repressive, and coercive course.\r\n     For a century and more from the Revolution it brought us nothing\r\n     but outwardly animosities and inwardly lethargy. The revival of a\r\n     livelier sense of duty and of God is now beginning to tell in the\r\n     altered policy of the church.... As her sense of her spiritual work\r\n     rises, she is becoming less eager to assert her exclusive claim,\r\n     leaving that to the state as a matter for itself to decide; and she\r\n     also begins to forego more readily, but cautiously, her external\r\n     prerogatives.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[181] Some proceedings, I think, of Mr. Disraeli and his Young England\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n[182] Chapter of Autobiography: _Gleanings_, vii. pp. 142-3.\r\n\r\n[183] On Reserve in Communicating Religious Knowledge--Tracts 80 and 87.\r\n(1837-40).

For\r\n     eight hundred or a thousand years they have been intimately\r\n     associated with everything that has concerned the highest interests\r\n     of the country.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the fortunes of a general election brought Mr. Gladstone into\r\nrelations that for many years to come deeply affected his political\r\ncourse. As a planet's orbit has puzzled astronomers until they discover\r\nthe secret of its irregularities in the attraction of an unseen and\r\nunsuspected neighbour in the firmament, so some devious motions of this\r\ngreat luminary of ours were perturbations due in fact to the influence\r\nof his new constituency. As we have seen, Mr. Gladstone quitted Newark\r\nwhen he entered the cabinet to repeal the corn law. At the end of 1846,\r\nwriting to Lord Lyttelton from Fasque, he tells him: 'I wish to be in\r\nparliament but coldly; feeling at the same time that I ought to wish it\r\nwarmly on many grounds. But my father is so very keen in his protective\r\nopinions, and I am so very decidedly of the other way of thinking, that\r\nI look forward with some reluctance and regret to what must, when it\r\nhappens, place me in marked and public contrast with him.' The thing\r\nsoon happened.\r\n\r\n     I remained, he says, without a seat until the dissolution in June\r\n     1847. But several months before this occurred it had become known\r\n     that Mr. Estcourt would vacate his seat for Oxford, and I became a\r\n     candidate. It was a serious campaign. The constituency, much to its\r\n     honour, did not stoop to fight the battle on the ground of\r\n     protection. But it was fought, and that fiercely, on religious\r\n     grounds. There was an incessant discussion, and I may say\r\n     dissection, of my character and position in reference to the Oxford\r\n     movement. This cut very deep, for it was a discussion which each\r\n     member of the constituency was entitled to carry on for himself.\r\n     The upshot was favourable. The liberals supported me gallantly, so\r\n     did many zealous churchmen, apart from politics, and a good number\r\n     of moderate men, so that I was returned by a fair majority. I held\r\n     the seat for eighteen years, but with five contests and a final\r\n     defeat.\r\n\r\nThe other sitting member after the retirement of Mr. Estcourt was Sir\r\nRobert Harry Inglis, who had beaten Peel by a very narrow majority in\r\nthe memorable contest for the university seat on the final crisis of the\r\ncatholic question in 1829. He was blessed with a genial character and an\r\nopen and happy demeanour; and the fact that he was equipped with a full\r\nstore of sincere and inexorable prejudices made it easy for him to be\r\nthe most upright, honourable, kindly, and consistent of political men.\r\nRepeal of the Test acts, relief of the catholics, the Reform bill,\r\nrelief of the Jews, reform of the Irish church, the grant to Maynooth,\r\nthe repeal of the corn laws--one after another he had stoutly resisted\r\nthe whole catalogue of revolutionising change. So manful a record made\r\nhis seat safe. In the struggle for the second seat, Mr. Gladstone's\r\nfriends encountered first Mr. Cardwell, a colleague of his as secretary\r\nof the treasury in the late government. Cardwell was deep in the\r\nconfidence and regard of Sir Robert Peel, and he earned in after years\r\nthe reputation of an honest and most capable administrator; but in these\r\nearlier days the ill-natured called him Peel-and-water, others labelled\r\nhim latitudinarian and indifferent, and though he had the support of\r\nPeel, promised before Mr. Gladstone's name as candidate was announced,\r\nhe thought it wise at a pretty early hour to withdraw from a triangular\r\nfight. The old high-and-dry party and the evangelical party combined to\r\nbring out Mr. Round. If he had achieved no sort of distinction, Mr.\r\nRound had at least given no offence: above all, he had kept clear of all\r\nthose tractarian innovations which had been finally stamped with the\r\ncensure of the university two years before.\r\n\r\n                         OXFORD SUPPORTERS\r\n\r\nCharles Wordsworth, his old tutor and now warden of Glenalmond, found it\r\nhard to give Mr. Gladstone his support, because he himself held to the\r\nhigh principle of state conscience, while the candidate seemed more than\r\never bent on the rival doctrine of social justice. Mr. Hallam joined his\r\ncommittee, and what that learned veteran's adhesion was in influence\r\namong older men, that of Arthur Clough was among the younger. Northcote\r\ndescribed Clough to Mr. Gladstone as a very favourable specimen of a\r\nclass, growing in numbers and importance among the younger Oxford men, a\r\nfriend of Carlyle's, Frank Newman's, and others of that stamp; well read\r\nin German literature and an admirer of German intellect, but also a\r\nstill deeper admirer of Dante; just now busily taking all his opinions\r\nto pieces and not beginning to put them together again; but so earnest\r\nand good that he might be trusted to work them into something better\r\nthan his friends inclined to fear. Ruskin, again, who had the year\r\nbefore published the memorable second volume of his _Modern Painters_\r\n(he was still well under thirty), was on the right side, and the Oxford\r\nchairman is sure that Mr. Gladstone will appreciate at its full value\r\nthe support of such high personal merit and extraordinary natural\r\ngenius. Scott, the learned Grecian who had been beaten along with Mr.\r\nGladstone in the contest for the Ireland scholarship seventeen years\r\nbefore, wrote to him:--'Ever since the time when you and I received\r\nStrypes at the hand of the vice-chancellor, and so you became my\r\n\r\n                     [Greek: homomastigias\r\n    labon agonos tas isas plegas emoi,'][1]\r\n\r\nI have looked forward to your being the representative of the\r\nuniversity.' Richard Greswell of Worcester was the faithful chairman of\r\nhis Oxford committee now and to the end, eighteen years off. He had\r\nreached the dignity of a bachelor of divinity, but nearly all the rest\r\nwere no more than junior masters.\r\n\r\nRouth, the old president of Magdalen, declined to vote for him on the\r\nwell-established ground that Christ Church had no business to hold both\r\nseats. Mr. Gladstone at once met this by the dexterous proposition that\r\nthough Christ Church was not entitled to elect him against the wish of\r\nthe other colleges, yet the other colleges were entitled to elect him if\r\nthey liked, by giving him a majority not made up of Christ Church votes.\r\nHis eldest brother had written to tell him in terms of affectionate\r\nregret, that he could take no part in the election; mere political\r\ndifferences would be secondary, but in the case of a university,\r\nreligion came first, and there it was impossible to separate a candidate\r\nfrom his religious opinions. When the time came, however, partly under\r\nstrong pressure from Sir John, Thomas Gladstone took a more lenient view\r\nand gave his brother a vote.\r\n\r\nThe Round men pointed triumphantly to their hero's votes on Maynooth and\r\non the Dissenters' Chapels bill, and insisted on the urgency of\r\nupholding the principles of the united church of England and Ireland in\r\ntheir full integrity. The backers of Mr. Gladstone retorted by recalling\r\ntheir champion's career; how in 1834 he first made himself known by his\r\nresistance to the admission of dissenters to the universities; how in\r\n1841 he threw himself into the first general move for the increase of\r\nthe colonial episcopate, which had resulted in the erection of eleven\r\nnew sees in six years; how zealously with energy and money he had\r\nlaboured for a college training for the episcopalian clergy in Scotland;\r\nhow instrumental he was in 1846, during the few months for which he held\r\nthe seals of secretary of state, in erecting four colonial bishoprics;\r\nhow the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, through the mouth of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury himself, had thanked him for his services;\r\nhow long he had been an active supporter of the great societies for the\r\nspread of church principles, the propagation of church doctrines, and\r\nthe erection of church fabrics. As for the Dissenters' Chapels bill, it\r\nwas an act of simple justice and involved no principles at issue between\r\nthe church and dissent, and Mr. Gladstone's masterly exposition of the\r\ntendency of dissent to drop one by one all the vital truths of\r\nChristianity was proclaimed to be a real service to the church. The\r\nreader will thus see the lie of the land, what it meant to be member for\r\na university, and why Mr. Gladstone thought the seat the highest of\r\nelectoral prizes.\r\n\r\n                             THE CONTEST\r\n\r\nA circular was issued impugning his position on protestant grounds. 'I\r\nhumbly trust,' wrote Mr. Gladstone in reply (July 26), 'that its writers\r\nare not justified in exhibiting me to the world as a person otherwise\r\nthan heartily devoted to the doctrine and constitution of our reformed\r\nchurch. But I will never consent to adopt as the test of such doctrine,\r\na disposition to identify the great and noble cause of the church of\r\nEngland with the restraint of the civil rights of those who differ from\r\nher.' Much was made of Mr. Gladstone's refusal to vote for the\r\ndegradation of Ward. People wrote to the newspapers that it was an\r\nadmitted and notorious fact that a sister of Mr. Gladstone's under his\r\nown influence had gone over to the church of Rome.[200] The fable was\r\nretracted, but at once revived in the still grosser untruth, that he\r\nhabitually employed 'a Jesuitical system of argument' to show that\r\nnobody need leave the church of England, 'because all might be had there\r\nthat was to be enjoyed in the church of Rome.' Maurice published a\r\nletter to a London clergyman vigorously remonstrating against the\r\nbigoted spirit that this election was warming into life, and fervently\r\nprotesting against making a belief in the Nicene creed into the same\r\nthing as an opinion about a certain way of treating the property of\r\nunitarians. 'One artifice of this kind,' said Maurice, 'has been\r\npractised in this election which it makes me blush to speak of. Mr. Ward\r\ncalled the reformation a vile and accursed thing; Mr. Gladstone voted\r\nagainst a certain measure for the condemnation of Mr. Ward; therefore he\r\nspoke of the reformation as a vile and accursed thing. I should not\r\nhave believed it possible that such a conclusion had been drawn from\r\nsuch premisses even by our religious press.'\r\n\r\nThe worthy Mr. Round, on the other hand, was almost impregnable. A\r\ndiligent scrutiny at last dragged the dark fact to the light of day,\r\nthat he had actually sat on Peel's election committee at the time of\r\ncatholic emancipation in 1829, and had voted for him against Inglis. So\r\nit appears, said the mocking Gladstonians, that the protestant Mr. Round\r\n'was willing to lend a helping hand to the first of a series of measures\r\nwhich are considered by his supporters as fraught with danger to the\r\ncountry's very best interests.' A still more sinister rumour was next\r\nbruited abroad: that Mr. Round attended a dissenting place of worship,\r\nand he was constrained to admit that, once in 1845 and thrice in 1846,\r\nhe had been guilty of this blacksliding. The lost ground, however, was\r\nhandsomely recovered by a public declaration that the very rare\r\noccasions on which he had been present at other modes of Christian\r\nworship had only confirmed his affection and reverential attachment to\r\nthe services and formularies of his own church.\r\n\r\n                        VICTORY AT THE POLL\r\n\r\nThe nomination was duly made in the Sheldonian theatre (July 29), the\r\nscene of so many agitations in these fiery days. Inglis was proposed by\r\na canon of Christ Church, Round by the master of Balliol, and Gladstone\r\nby Dr. Richards, the rector of Exeter. The prime claim advanced for him\r\nby his proposer, was his zeal for the English church in word and deed,\r\nabove all his energy in securing that wherever the English church went,\r\nthither bishoprics should go too. Besides all this, his master work, he\r\nhad found time to spare not only for public business of the\r\ncommonwealth, but for the study of theology, philosophy, and the\r\narts.[201] Then the voting began. The Gladstonians went into the battle\r\nwith 1100 promises. Northcote,[202] passing vigilant days in the\r\nconvocation house, sent daily reports to Mr. Gladstone at Fasque. Peel\r\nwent up to vote for him (splitting for Inglis); Ashley went up to vote\r\nagainst him. At the close of the second day things looked well, but\r\nthere was no ground for over-confidence. Inglis was six hundred ahead of\r\nGladstone, and Gladstone only a hundred and twenty ahead of Round. The\r\nnext day Round fell a little more behind, and when the end came (August\r\n3) the figures stood:--Inglis 1700, Gladstone 997, Round 824, giving\r\nGladstone a majority of 173 over his competitor.\r\n\r\nNumbers were not the only important point. When the poll came to be\r\nanalysed by eager statisticians, the decision of the electors was found\r\nto have a weight not measured by an extra hundred and seventy votes. For\r\nexample, Mr. Gladstone had among his supporters twenty-five\r\ndouble-firsts against seven for Round, and of single first-classes he\r\nhad one hundred and fifty-seven against Round's sixty-six. Of Ireland\r\nand Hertford scholars Mr. Gladstone had nine to two and three to one\r\nrespectively; and of chancellor's prizemen who voted he had forty-five\r\nagainst twelve. Of fellows of colleges he had two hundred and eighteen\r\nagainst one hundred and twenty-eight, and his majority in this class\r\nwas highest where the elections to fellowships were open. The heads of\r\nthe colleges told a different tale. Of these, sixteen voted for Round\r\nand only four for Gladstone. This discrepancy it was that gave its\r\nsignificance to the victory. Sitting in the convocation house watching\r\nthe last casual voters drop in at the rate of two or three an hour\r\nthrough the summer afternoon, the ever faithful Northcote wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone at Fasque:--\r\n\r\n     Since I have been here, the contest has seemed even more\r\n     interesting than it did in London. The effect of the contest itself\r\n     has apparently been good. It has brought together the younger men\r\n     without distinction of party, and has supplied the elements of a\r\n     very noble party which will now look to you as a leader. I think\r\n     men of all kinds are prepared to trust you, and though each feels\r\n     that you will probably differ from his set in some particulars,\r\n     each seems disposed to waive objections for the sake of the general\r\n     good he expects....\r\n\r\n     The victory is not looked upon as 'Puseyite'; it is a victory of\r\n     the masters over the Hebdomadal board, and as such a very important\r\n     one. The Heads felt it their last chance, and are said to have\r\n     expressed themselves accordingly. The provost of Queen's, who is\r\n     among the dissatisfied supporters of Round, said the other day, 'He\r\n     would rather be represented by an old woman than by a young man.'\r\n     It is not as a Maynoothian that you are dreaded here, though they\r\n     use the cry against you and though that is the country feeling, but\r\n     as a possible reformer and a man who thinks. On the other hand, the\r\n     young men exult, partly in the hope that you will do something for\r\n     the university yourself, partly in the consciousness that they have\r\n     shown the strength of the magisterial party by carrying you against\r\n     the opposition of the Heads, and have proved their title to be\r\n     considered an important element of the university. They do not seem\r\n     yet to be sufficiently united to effect great things, but there is\r\n     a large amount of ability and earnestness which only wants\r\n     direction, and this contest has tended to unite them. 'Puseyism'\r\n     seems rather to be a name of the past, though there are still\r\n     Puseyites of importance. Marriott, Mozley, and Church appear to be\r\n     regarded as leaders; but Church who is now abroad, is looked upon\r\n     as something more, and I am told may be considered on the whole\r\n     the fairest exponent of the feelings of the place. Stanley, Jowett,\r\n     Temple, and others are great names in what is nicknamed the\r\n     Germanising party. Lake, and perhaps I should say Temple, hold an\r\n     intermediate position between the two parties.... Whatever may have\r\n     been the evils attendant on the Puseyite movement, and I believe\r\n     they were neither few nor small, it has been productive of great\r\n     results; and it is not a little satisfactory to see how its\r\n     distinctive features are dying away and the spirit surviving,\r\n     instead of the spirit departing and leaving a great sham behind it.\r\n\r\n                     PECULIARITY OF ELECTION\r\n\r\nOf the many strange positions to which in his long and ardent life Mr.\r\nGladstone was brought, none is more startling than to find him, as in\r\nthis curious moment at Oxford, the common rallying-point of two\r\nviolently antagonistic sections of opinion. Dr. Pusey supported him;\r\nStanley and Jowett supported him. The old school who looked on Oxford as\r\nthe ancient and peculiar inheritance of the church were zealous for him;\r\nthe new school who deemed the university an organ not of the church but\r\nof the nation, eagerly took him for their champion. A great\r\necclesiastical movement, reviving authority and tradition, had ended in\r\ncomplete academic repulse in 1845. It was now to be followed by an\r\nanti-ecclesiastical movement, critical, sceptical, liberal, scornful of\r\nauthority, doubtful of tradition. Yet both the receding force and the\r\nrising force united to swell the stream that bore Mr. Gladstone to\r\ntriumph at the poll. The fusion did not last. The two bands speedily\r\ndrew off into their rival camps, to arm themselves in the new conflict\r\nfor mastery between obscurantism and illumination. The victor was left\r\nwith his laurels in what too soon proved to be, after all, a vexed and\r\nprecarious situation, that he could neither hold with freedom nor quit\r\nwith honour.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he thoroughly enjoyed his much coveted distinction:--\r\n\r\n                          _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _Exeter Coll., Nov. 2, 1847._--This morning in company with Sir R.\r\n     Inglis, and under the protection or chaperonage of the dean, I have\r\n     made the formal circuit of visits to all the heads of houses and\r\n     all the common-rooms. It has gone off very well. There was but one\r\n     reception by a head (Corpus) that was not decidedly _kind_, and\r\n     that was only a little cold. Marsham (Merton), who is a frank, warm\r\n     man, keenly opposed, said very fairly, to Inglis, 'I congratulate\r\n     you warmly'; and then to me, 'And I would be very glad to do the\r\n     same to you, Mr. Gladstone, if I could think you would do the same\r\n     as Sir R. Inglis.' I like a man for this. They say the dean should\r\n     have asked me to dine to-day, but I think he may be, and perhaps\r\n     wisely, afraid of recognising me in any very marked way, for fear\r\n     of endangering the old Christ Church right to one seat which it is\r\n     his peculiar duty to guard.\r\n\r\n     We dined yesterday in the hall at Christ Church, it being a grand\r\n     day there. Rather unfortunately the undergraduates chose to make a\r\n     row in honour of me during dinner, which the two censors had to run\r\n     all down the hall to stop. This had better not be talked about.\r\n     Thursday the warden of All Souls' has asked me and I _think_ I must\r\n     accept; had it not been a head (and it is one of the little party\r\n     of four who voted for me) I should not have doubted, but at once\r\n     have declined.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[199] _Frogs_, 756; the second line is Scott's own. An Aristophanic\r\nfriend translates:--\r\n\r\n  'Good brother-rogue, we've shared the selfsame beating:\r\n  At least, we carried off one Strype apiece.'\r\n\r\nStrype was the book given to Scott and Gladstone as being good seconds\r\nto the winner of the Ireland. See above p. 61.\r\n\r\n[200] _Standard_, May 29, 1847.\r\n\r\n[201] The proposer's Latin is succinct, and may be worth giving for its\r\nacademic flavour:--'Jam inde a pueritia literarum studio imbutus, et in\r\nceleberrimo Etonensi gymnasio informatus, ad nostram accessit academiam,\r\nubi morum honestate, pietate, et pudore nemini aequalium secundus, indole\r\net ingenio facile omnibus antecellebat.

On the appointment of his first private secretary,\r\nMr. Rawson, to a post in Canada in 1842, Mr. Gladstone applied to\r\nColeridge of Eton to recommend a successor. He suggested three names,\r\nFarrer, afterwards Lord Farrer, Northcote, and Pocock. Northcote, who\r\nlooked to a political career, was chosen. 'Mr. Gladstone,' he wrote to a\r\nfriend, June 30, 1842, 'is the man of all others among the statesmen of\r\nthe present day to whom I should desire to attach myself.... He is one\r\nwhom I respect beyond measure; he stands almost alone as representative\r\nof principles with which I cordially agree; and as a man of business,\r\nand one who humanly speaking is sure to rise, he is preeminent.'--Lang's\r\n_Life of Lord Iddesleigh_, i. pp. 63-67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         THE HAWARDEN ESTATE\r\n\r\n                               (_1847_)\r\n\r\n     It is no Baseness for the Greatest to descend and looke into their\r\n     owne Estate.

They can no more be altogether omitted here than\r\nthe bills, acceptances, renewals, notes of hand, and all the other\r\nfinancial apparatus of his printers and publishers can be left out of\r\nthe story of Sir Walter Scott. Not many pages will be needed, though\r\nthis brevity will give the reader little idea of the pre-occupations\r\nwith which they beset a not inconsiderable proportion of Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndays. A few sentences in a biography many a time mean long chapters in a\r\nlife, and what looked like an incident turns out to be an epoch.\r\n\r\nSir Stephen Glynne possessed a small property in Staffordshire of\r\nsomething less than a hundred acres of land, named the Oak Farm, near\r\nStourbridge, and under these acres were valuable seams of coal and\r\nironstone. For this he refused an offer of five-and-thirty thousand\r\npounds in 1835, and under the advice of an energetic and sanguine agent\r\nproceeded to its rapid development. On the double marriage in 1839, Sir\r\nStephen associated his two brothers-in-law with himself to the modest\r\nextent of one-tenth share each in an enterprise that seemed of high\r\nprospective value. Their interests were acquired through their wives,\r\nand it is to be presumed that they had no opportunity of making a\r\npersonal examination of the concern. The adventurous agent, now\r\nmanager-in-chief of the business, rapidly extended operations, setting\r\nup furnaces, forges, rolling-mills, and all the machinery for producing\r\ntools and hardware for which he foresaw a roaring foreign market. The\r\nagent's confidence and enthusiasm mastered his principal, and large\r\ncapital was raised solely on the security of the Hawarden fortune and\r\ncredit. Whether Oak Farm was irrationally inflated or not, we cannot\r\nsay, though the impression is that it had the material of a sound\r\nproperty if carefully worked; but it was evidently pushed in excess of\r\nits realisable capital. The whole basis of its credit was the Hawarden\r\nestate, and a forced stoppage of Oak Farm would be the death-blow to\r\nHawarden. As early as 1844 clouds rose on the horizon. The position of\r\nSir Stephen Glynne had become seriously compromised, while under the\r\nsystem of unlimited partnership the liability of his two brothers-in-law\r\nextended in proportion. In 1845 the three brothers-in-law by agreement\r\nretired, each retaining an equitable mortgage on the concern. Two years\r\nlater, one of our historic panics shook the money-market, and in its\r\ncourse brought down Oak Farm.[203] A great accountant reported, a\r\nmeeting was held at Freshfield's, the company was found hopelessly\r\ninsolvent, and it was determined to wind up. The court directed a sale.\r\nIn April 1849, at Birmingham, Mr. Gladstone purchased the concern on\r\nbehalf of himself and his two brothers-in-law, subject to certain\r\nexisting interests; and in May Sir Stephen Glynne resumed legal\r\npossession of the wreck of Oak Farm. The burden on Hawarden was over\r\nL250,000, leaving its owner with no margin to live upon.\r\n\r\nInto this far-spreading entanglement Mr. Gladstone for several years\r\nthrew himself with the whole weight of his untiring tenacity and force.\r\nHe plunged into masses of accounts, mastered the coil of interests and\r\nparties, studied legal intricacies, did daily battle with human\r\nunreason, and year after year carried on a voluminous correspondence.\r\n\r\n                               OAK FARM\r\n\r\nThere are a hundred and forty of his letters to Mr. Freshfield on Oak\r\nFarm alone. Let us note in passing what is, I think, a not unimportant\r\nbiographic fact. These circumstances brought him into close and\r\nresponsible contact with a side of the material interests of the country\r\nthat was new to him. At home he had been bred in the atmosphere of\r\ncommerce. At the board of trade, in the reform of the tariff, in\r\nconnection with the Bank act and in the growth of the railway system, he\r\nhad been well trained in high economics. Now he came to serve an arduous\r\napprenticeship in the motions and machinery of industrial life. The\r\nlabour was immense, prolonged, uncongenial; but it completed his\r\nknowledge of the customs, rules, maxims, and currents of trade and it\r\nbore good fruit in future days at the exchequer. He manfully and\r\ndeliberately took up the burden as if the errors had been his own, and\r\nas if the financial sacrifice that he was called to make both now and\r\nlater were matter of direct and inexorable obligation. These, indeed,\r\nare the things in life that test whether a man be made of gold or clay.\r\n'The weight,' he writes to his father (June 16, 1849), 'of the private\r\ndemands upon my mind has been such, since the Oak Farm broke down, as\r\nfrequently to disqualify me for my duties in the House of Commons.' The\r\nload even tempted him, along with the working of other considerations,\r\nto think of total withdrawal from parliament and public life. Yet\r\nwithout a trace of the frozen stoicism or cynical apathy that sometimes\r\npasses muster for true resignation, he kept himself nobly free from\r\nvexation, murmur, repining, and complaint. Here is a moving passage from\r\na letter of the time to Mrs. Gladstone:--\r\n\r\n     _Fasque, Jan. 20, 1849._--Do not suppose for a moment that if I\r\n     could by waving my hand strike out for ever from my cares and\r\n     occupations those which relate to the Oak Farm and Stephen's\r\n     affairs, I would do so; I have never felt that, have never asked\r\n     it; and if my language seems to look that way, it is the mere\r\n     impatience of weakness comforting itself by finding a vent. It has\r\n     evidently come to me by the ordinance of God; and I am rather\r\n     frightened to think how light my lot would be, were it removed, so\r\n     light that something else would surely come in its place. I do not\r\n     confound it with visitations and afflictions; it is merely a drain\r\n     on strength and a peculiar one, because it asks for a kind of\r\n     strength and skill and habits which I have not, but it falls\r\n     altogether short of the category of high trials. Least of all\r\n     suppose that the subject can ever associate itself painfully with\r\n     the idea of you. No persons who have been in contact with it can be\r\n     so absolutely blameless as you and Mary, nor can _our_ relation\r\n     together be rendered in the very smallest degree less or more a\r\n     blessing by the addition or the subtraction of worldly wealth. I\r\n     have abundant comfort _now_ in the thought that at any rate I am\r\n     the means of keeping a load off the minds of others; and I shall\r\n     have much more hereafter when Stephen is brought through, and once\r\n     more firmly planted in the place of his fathers, provided I can\r\n     conscientiously feel that the restoration of his affairs has at any\r\n     rate not been impeded by indolence, obstinacy, or blunders on my\r\n     part. Nor can anything be more generous than the confidence placed\r\n     in me by all concerned. Indeed, I can only regret that it is too\r\n     free and absolute.\r\n\r\n                          LETTER TO HIS SON\r\n\r\nI may as well now tell the story to the end, though in anticipation of\r\nremote dates, for in truth it held a marked place in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nwhole life, and made a standing background amid the vast throng of\r\nvarying interests and transient commotions of his great career. Here is\r\nhis own narrative as told in a letter written to his eldest son for a\r\ndefinite purpose in 1885:--\r\n\r\n                        _To W. H. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _Hawarden, Oct. 3, 1885._--Down to the latter part of that year\r\n     (1847), your uncle Stephen was regarded by all as a wealthy country\r\n     gentleman with say L10,000 a year or more (subject, however, to his\r\n     mother's jointure) to spend, and great prospects from iron in a\r\n     Midland estate. In the bank crisis of that year the whole truth was\r\n     revealed; and it came out that his agent at the Oak Farm (and\r\n     formerly also at Hawarden) had involved him to the extent of\r\n     L250,000; to say nothing of minor blows to your uncle Lyttelton and\r\n     myself.\r\n\r\n     At a conversation in the library of 13 Carlton House Terrace, it\r\n     was considered whether Hawarden should be sold. Every obvious\r\n     argument was in favour of it, for example the comparison between\r\n     the income and the liabilities I have named. How was Lady Glynne's\r\n     jointure (L2500) to be paid? How was Sir Stephen to be supported?\r\n     There was _no_ income, even less than none. Oak Farm, the iron\r\n     property, was under lease to an insolvent company, and could not be\r\n     relied on. Your grandfather, who had in some degree surveyed the\r\n     state of affairs, thought the case was hopeless. But the family\r\n     were unanimously set upon making any and every effort and sacrifice\r\n     to avoid the necessity of sale. Mr. Barker, their lawyer, and Mr.\r\n     Burnett, the land agent, entirely sympathised; and it was resolved\r\n     to persevere. But the first effect was that Sir Stephen had to\r\n     close the house (which it was hoped, but hoped in vain, to let); to\r\n     give up carriages, horses, and I think for several years his\r\n     personal servant; and to take an allowance of L700 a year out of\r\n     which, I believe, he continued to pay the heavy subvention of the\r\n     family to the schools of the parish, which was certainly counted by\r\n     hundreds. Had the estate been sold, it was estimated that he would\r\n     have come out a wealthy bachelor, possessed of from a hundred to a\r\n     hundred and twenty thousands pounds free from all encumbrance but\r\n     the jointure.\r\n\r\n     In order to give effect to the nearly hopeless resolution thus\r\n     taken at the meeting in London, it was determined to clip the\r\n     estate by selling L200,000 worth of land. Of this, nearly one-half\r\n     was to be taken by your uncle Lyttelton and myself, in the\r\n     proportion of about two parts for me and one for him. Neither of us\r\n     had the power to buy this, but my father enabled me, and Lord\r\n     Spencer took over his portion. The rest of the sales were effected,\r\n     a number of fortunate secondary incidents occurred, and the great\r\n     business of recovering and realising from the Oak Farm was\r\n     laboriously set about.\r\n\r\n     Considerable relief was obtained by these and other measures. By\r\n     1852, there was a partial but perceptible improvement in the\r\n     position. The house was reopened in a very quiet way by\r\n     arrangement, and the allowance for Sir Stephen's expenditure was\r\n     rather more than doubled. But there was nothing like ease for him\r\n     until the purchase of the reversion was effected by me in 1865. I\r\n     paid L57,000 for the bulk of the property, subject to debts not\r\n     exceeding L150,000, and after the lives of the two brothers, the\r\n     table value of which was, I think, twenty-two and a-half years.\r\n     From this time your uncle had an income to spend of, I think,\r\n     L2200, or not more than half what he probably would have had since\r\n     1847 had the estate been sold, which it would only have been\r\n     through the grievous fault of others.\r\n\r\n     The full process of recovery was still incomplete, but the means of\r\n     carrying it forward were now comparatively simple. Since the\r\n     reversion came in, I have, as you know, forwarded that process; but\r\n     it has been retarded by agricultural depression and by the\r\n     disastrous condition through so many years of coal-mining; so that\r\n     there still remains a considerable work to be done before the end\r\n     can be attained, which I hope will never be lost sight of, namely,\r\n     that of extinguishing the debt upon the property, though for family\r\n     purposes the estate may still remain subject to charges in the way\r\n     of annuity.\r\n\r\n     The full history of the Hawarden estate from 1847 would run to a\r\n     volume. For some years after 1847, it and the Oak Farm supplied my\r\n     principal employment[204]; but I was amply repaid by the value of\r\n     it a little later on as a home, and by the unbroken domestic\r\n     happiness there enjoyed. What I think you will see, as clearly\r\n     resulting from this narrative, is the high obligation not only to\r\n     keep the estate in the family, and as I trust in its natural course\r\n     of descent, but to raise it to the best condition by thrift and\r\n     care, and to promote by all reasonable means the aim of diminishing\r\n     and finally extinguishing its debt.\r\n\r\n     This I found partly on a high estimate of the general duty to\r\n     promote the permanence of families having estates in land, but very\r\n     specially on the sacrifices made, through his remaining\r\n     twenty-seven years of life, by your uncle Stephen, without a\r\n     murmur, and with the concurrence of us all....\r\n\r\n     Before closing I will repair one omission. When I concurred in the\r\n     decision to struggle for the retention of Hawarden, I had not the\r\n     least idea that my children would have an interest in the\r\n     succession. In 1847 your uncle Stephen was only forty; your uncle\r\n     Henry, at thirty-seven, was married, and had a child almost every\r\n     year. It was not until 1865 that I had any title to look forward to\r\n     your becoming at a future time the proprietor.--Ever your\r\n     affectionate father.\r\n\r\n                          FINAL SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nThe upshot is this, that Mr. Gladstone, with his father's consent and\r\nsupport, threw the bulk of his own fortune into the assets of Hawarden.\r\nBy this, and the wise realisation of everything convertible to\r\nadvantage, including, in 1865, the reversion after the lives of Sir\r\nStephen Glynne and his brother, he succeeded in making what was left of\r\nHawarden solvent. His own expenditure from first to last upon the\r\nHawarden estate as now existing, he noted at L267,000. 'It has been for\r\nthirty-five years,' he wrote to W. H. Gladstone in 1882, '_i.e._, since\r\nthe breakdown in 1847, a great object of my life, in conjunction with\r\nyour mother and your uncle Stephen, to keep the Hawarden estate together\r\n(or replace what was alienated), to keep it in the family, and to\r\nrelieve it from debt with which it was ruinously loaded.'\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a settlement was made, to which Sir Stephen Glynne and his\r\nbrother, and Mr. Gladstone and his wife, were the parties, by which the\r\nestate was conveyed in trust for one or more of the Gladstone children\r\nas Mr. Gladstone might appoint.[205] This was subject to a power of\r\ndetermining the settlement by either of the Glynne brothers, on repaying\r\nwith interest the sum paid for the reversion. As the transaction touched\r\nmatters in which he might be supposed liable to bias, Mr. Gladstone\r\nrequired that its terms should be referred to two men of perfect\r\ncompetence and probity--Lord Devon and Sir Robert Phillimore--for their\r\njudgment and approval. Phillimore visited Hawarden (August 19-26, 1865)\r\nto meet Lord Devon, and to confer with him upon Sir Stephen Glynne's\r\naffairs. Here are a couple of entries from his diary:--\r\n\r\n     _Aug. 26._--The whole morning was occupied with the investigation\r\n     of S. G.'s affairs by Lord Devon and myself. We examined at some\r\n     length the solicitor and the agent. Lord D. and I perfectly agreed\r\n     in the opinion expressed in a memorandum signed by us both.\r\n     Gladstone, as might have been expected, has behaved very well.\r\n     _Sept. 19_ [_London_].--Correspondence between Lyttelton and\r\n     Gladstone, contained in Lord Devon's letter. Same subject as that\r\n     which Lord D. and I came to consult upon at Hawarden. _Sept.\r\n     24._--I wrote to Stephen Glynne to the effect that Henry entirely\r\n     approved of the scheme agreed upon by Lord D. and myself, after a\r\n     new consideration of all the circumstances, and after reading the\r\n     Lyttelton-Gladstone correspondence. I showed Henry Glynne the\r\n     letter, of which he entirely approved.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the death of Sir Stephen Glynne, following that of his brother\r\ntwo years before, made Mr. Gladstone owner in possession of the Hawarden\r\nestate, under the transaction of 1865. With as little delay as possible\r\n(April 1875) he took the necessary steps to make his eldest son the\r\nowner in fee, and seven years after that (October 1882) he further\r\ntransferred to the same son his own lands in the county, acquired by\r\npurchase, as we have seen, after the crash in 1847. By agreement, the\r\npossession and control of the castle and its contents remained with Mrs.\r\nGladstone for life, as if she were taking a life-interest in it under\r\nsettlement or will.\r\n\r\n                     FURTHER LETTERS TO HIS SON\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, for a few months the legal owner of the whole\r\nHawarden estate, Mr. Gladstone divested himself of that quality as soon\r\nas he could, and at no time did he assume to be its master. The letters\r\nwritten by him on these matters to his son are both too interesting as\r\nthe expression of his views on high articles of social policy, and too\r\ncharacteristic of his ideas of personal duty, for me to omit them here,\r\nthough much out of their strict chronological place. The first is\r\nwritten after the death of Sir Stephen, and the falling in of the\r\nreversion:--\r\n\r\n                       _To W. H. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     11 _Carlton House Terrace, April 5, 1875._--There are several\r\n     matters which I have to mention to you, and for which the present\r\n     moment is suitable; while they embrace the future in several of its\r\n     aspects.\r\n\r\n     1. I have given instructions to Messrs. Barker and Hignett to\r\n     convert your life interest under the Hawarden settlement into a fee\r\n     simple. Reflection and experience have brought me to favour this\r\n     latter method of holding landed property as on the whole the best,\r\n     though the arguments may not be all on one side. In the present\r\n     case, they are to my mind entirely conclusive. First, because I am\r\n     able thoroughly to repose in you an entire confidence as to your\r\n     use of the estate during your lifetime, and your capacity to\r\n     provide wisely for its future destination. Secondly, because you\r\n     have, delivered over to you with the estate, the duty and office of\r\n     progressively emancipating it from the once ruinous debt; and it is\r\n     almost necessary towards the satisfactory prosecution of this\r\n     purpose, which it may still take very many years to complete, that\r\n     you should be entire master of the property, and should feel the\r\n     full benefit of the steady care and attention which it ought to\r\n     receive from you.\r\n\r\n     2. I hope that with it you will inherit the several conterminous\r\n     properties belonging to me, and that you will receive these in such\r\n     a condition as to enjoy a large proportion of the income they\r\n     yield. Taking the two estates together, they form the most\r\n     considerable estate in the county, and give what may be termed the\r\n     first social position there. The importance of this position is\r\n     enhanced by the large population which inhabits them. You will, I\r\n     hope, familiarise your mind with this truth, that you can no more\r\n     become the proprietor of such a body of property, or of the portion\r\n     of it now accruing, than your brother Stephen could become rector\r\n     of the parish, without recognising the serious moral and social\r\n     responsibilities which belong to it. They are full of interest and\r\n     rich in pleasure, but they demand (in the absence of special cause)\r\n     residence on the spot, and a good share of time, and especially a\r\n     free and ungrudging discharge of them. Nowhere in the world is the\r\n     position of the landed proprietor so high as in this country, and\r\n     this in great part for the reason that nowhere else is the\r\n     possession of landed property so closely associated with definite\r\n     duty.\r\n\r\n     3. In truth, with this and your seat in parliament, which I hope\r\n     (whether Whitby supply it, or whether you migrate) will continue,\r\n     you will, I trust, have a well-charged, though not an\r\n     over-charged, life, and will, like professional and other\r\n     thoroughly employed men, have to regard the bulk of your time as\r\n     forestalled on behalf of duty, while a liberal residue may be\r\n     available for your special pursuits and tastes, and for\r\n     recreations. This is really the sound basis of life, which never\r\n     can be honourable or satisfactory without adequate guarantees\r\n     against frittering away, even in part, the precious gift of time.\r\n\r\n     While touching on the subject I would remind you of an old\r\n     recommendation of mine, that you should choose some parliamentary\r\n     branch or subject, to which to give special attention. The House of\r\n     Commons has always heard your voice with pleasure, and ought not to\r\n     be allowed to forget it. I say this the more freely, because I\r\n     think it is, in your case, the virtue of a real modesty, which\r\n     rather too much indisposes you to put yourself forward.\r\n\r\n     Yet another word. As years gather upon me, I naturally look forward\r\n     to what is to be after I am gone; and although I should indeed be\r\n     sorry to do or say anything having a tendency to force the action\r\n     of your mind beyond its natural course, it will indeed be a great\r\n     pleasure to me to see you well settled in life by marriage. Well\r\n     settled, I feel confident, you will be, if settled at all. In your\r\n     position at Hawarden, there would then be at once increased ease\r\n     and increased attraction in the performance of your duties; nor can\r\n     I overlook the fact that the life of the unmarried man, in this age\r\n     particularly, is under peculiar and insidious temptations to\r\n     selfishness, unless his celibacy arise from a very strong and\r\n     definite course of self-devotion to the service of God and his\r\n     fellow creatures.\r\n\r\n     The great and sad change of Hawarden [by the death of Sir Stephen]\r\n     which has forced upon us the consideration of so many subjects,\r\n     gave at the same time an opening for others, and it seemed to me to\r\n     be best to put together the few remarks I had to make. I hope the\r\n     announcement with which I began will show that I write in the\r\n     spirit of confidence as well as of affection. It is on this footing\r\n     that we have ever stood, and I trust ever shall stand. You have\r\n     acted towards me at all times up to the standard of all I could\r\n     desire. May you have the help of the Almighty to embrace as justly,\r\n     and fulfil as cheerfully, the whole conception of your duties in\r\n     the position to which it has pleased Him to call you, and which\r\n     perhaps has come upon you with somewhat the effect of a surprise;\r\n     that may, however, have the healthy influence of a stimulus to\r\n     action, and a help towards excellence. Believe me ever, my dear\r\n     son, your affectionate father.\r\n\r\n                        DUTIES OF A LANDOWNER\r\n\r\nIn the second letter Mr. Gladstone informed W. H. Gladstone that he had\r\nat Chester that morning (Oct. 23, 1882), along with Mrs. Gladstone,\r\nexecuted the deeds that made his son the proprietor of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nlands in Flintshire, subject to the payment of annuities specified in\r\nthe instrument of transfer; and he proceeds:--\r\n\r\n     I earnestly entreat that you will never, under any circumstances,\r\n     mortgage any of your land. I consider that our law has offered to\r\n     proprietors of land, under a narrow and mistaken notion of\r\n     promoting their interests, dangerous facilities and inducements to\r\n     this practice; and that its mischievous consequences have been so\r\n     terribly felt (the word is strong, but hardly too strong) in the\r\n     case of Hawarden, that they ought to operate powerfully as a\r\n     warning for the future.\r\n\r\n     You are not the son of very wealthy parents; but the income of the\r\n     estates (the Hawarden estates and mine jointly), with your prudence\r\n     and diligence, will enable you to go steadily forward in the work I\r\n     have had in hand, and after a time will in the course of nature\r\n     give considerable means for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     I have much confidence in your prudence and intelligence; I have\r\n     not the smallest fear that the rather unusual step I have taken\r\n     will in any way weaken the happy union and harmony of our family;\r\n     and I am sure you will always bear in mind the duties which attach\r\n     to you as the head of those among whom you receive a preference,\r\n     and as the landlord of a numerous tenantry, prepared to give you\r\n     their confidence and affection.\r\n\r\nA third letter on the same topics followed three years after, and\r\ncontains a narrative of the Hawarden transactions already given in an\r\nearlier page of this chapter.\r\n\r\n                        _To W. H. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _Oct. 3, 1885._--When you first made known to me that you thought\r\n     of retiring from the general election of this year, I received the\r\n     intimation with mixed feelings. The question of money no doubt\r\n     deserves, under existing circumstances, to be kept in view; still I\r\n     must think twice before regarding this as the conclusive question.\r\n     I conceive the balance has to be struck mainly between these two\r\n     things; on the one hand, the duty of persons connected with the\r\n     proprietorship of considerable estates in land, to assume freely\r\n     the burden and responsibility of serving in parliament. On the\r\n     other hand, the peculiar position of this combined estate, which in\r\n     the first place is of a nature to demand from the proprietor an\r\n     unusual degree of care and supervision, and which in the second\r\n     place has been hit severely by recent depressions in corn and coal,\r\n     which may be termed its two pillars.\r\n\r\n     On the first point it may fairly be taken into view that in serving\r\n     for twenty years you have stood four contested elections, a number\r\n     I think decidedly beyond the average.... I will assume, for the\r\n     present, that the election has passed without bringing you back to\r\n     parliament. I should then consider that you had thus relieved\r\n     yourself, at any rate for a period, from a serious call upon your\r\n     time and mind, mainly with a view to the estate; and on this\r\n     account, and because I have constituted you its legal master, I\r\n     write this letter in order to place clearly before you some of the\r\n     circumstances which invest your relation to it with a rather\r\n     peculiar character.\r\n\r\n     I premise a few words of a general nature. An enemy to entails,\r\n     principally though not exclusively on social and domestic grounds,\r\n     I nevertheless regard it as a very high duty to labour for the\r\n     conservation of estates, and the permanence of the families in\r\n     possession of them, as a principal source of our social strength,\r\n     and as a large part of true conservatism, from the time when\r\n     Aeschylus wrote\r\n\r\n            [Greek: archaioplouton despoton polle charis].[206]\r\n\r\n     But if their possession is to be prolonged by conduct, not by\r\n     factitious arrangements, we must recognise this consequence, that\r\n     conduct becomes subject to fresh demands and liabilities.\r\n\r\n     In condemning laws which tie up the _corpus_, I say nothing\r\n     against powers of charge, either by marriage settlement or\r\n     otherwise, for wife and children, although questions of degree and\r\n     circumstance may always have to be considered. But to mortgages I\r\n     am greatly opposed. Whether they ought or ought not to be\r\n     restrained by law, I do not now inquire. But I am confident that\r\n     few and rare causes only will warrant them, and that as a general\r\n     rule they are mischievous, and in many cases, as to their\r\n     consequences, anti-social and immoral. Wherever they exist they\r\n     ought to be looked upon as evils, which are to be warred upon and\r\n     got rid of. One of our financial follies has been to give them\r\n     encouragement by an excessively low tax; and one of the better\r\n     effects of the income-tax is that it is a fine upon mortgaging.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[203] For an account of the creditors' meeting held at Birmingham on\r\nDec. 2, 1847, see the _Times_ of Dec. 3, 1847.\r\n\r\n[204] To Lord Lyttelton, July 29, 1874: 'I could not devote my entire\r\nlife to it; and after 1852 my attention was only occasional.'\r\n\r\n[205] This settlement followed the lines of a will made by Sir Stephen\r\nin 1855, devising the estate to his brother for life, with the remainder\r\nto his brother's sons in tail male; and next to W. H. Gladstone and his\r\nsons in tail male, and then to W. E. Gladstone's other sons; and in\r\ndefault of male issue of W. E. Gladstone, then to the eldest and other\r\nsons of Lord Lyttelton, and so forth in the ordinary form of an entailed\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n[206] _Agam._ 1043, 'A great blessing are masters with, ancient riches.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                 PARTY EVOLUTION--NEW COLONIAL POLICY\r\n\r\n                            (_1846-1850_)\r\n\r\n     I shall ever thankfully rejoice to have lived in a period when so\r\n     blessed a change in our colonial policy was brought about; a change\r\n     which is full of promise and profit to a country having such claims\r\n     on mankind as England, but also a change of system, in which we\r\n     have done no more than make a transition from misfortune and from\r\n     evil, back to the rules of justice, of reason, of nature, and of\r\n     common sense.--GLADSTONE (1856).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Peel and the break up of the conservative party in 1846 led\r\nto a long train of public inconveniences. When Lord John Russell was\r\nforming his government, he saw Peel, and proposed to include any of his\r\nparty. Peel thought such a junction under existing circumstances\r\nunadvisable, but said he should have no ground of complaint if Lord John\r\nmade offers to any of his friends; and he should not attempt to\r\ninfluence them either way.[207] The action ended in a proposal of office\r\nto Dalhousie, Lincoln, and Sidney Herbert. Nothing came of it, and the\r\nwhigs were left to go on as they best could upon the narrow base of\r\ntheir own party. The protectionists gave them to understand that before\r\nBentinck and his friends made up their minds to turn Peel out, they had\r\ndecided that it would not be fair to put the whigs in merely to punish\r\nthe betrayer, and then to turn round upon them. On the contrary, fair\r\nand candid support was what they intended. The conservative government\r\nhad carried liberal measures; the liberal government subsisted on\r\nconservative declarations. Such was this singular situation.\r\n\r\n                   PEELITES AND PROTECTIONISTS\r\n\r\nThe Peelites, according to a memorandum of Mr. Gladstone's, from a\r\nnumber approaching 120 in the corn law crisis of 1846, were reduced at\r\nonce by the election of 1847 to less than half. This number, added to\r\nthe liberal force, gave free trade a very large majority: added to the\r\nprotectionists it just turned the balance in their favour. So long as\r\nSir Robert Peel lived (down to June 1850) the entire body never voted\r\nwith the protectionists. From the first a distinction arose among Peel's\r\nadherents that widened, as time went on, and led to a long series of\r\ndoubts, perturbations, manoeuvres. These perplexities lasted down to\r\n1859, and they constitute a vital chapter in Mr. Gladstone's political\r\nstory. The distinction was in the nature of political things. Many of\r\nthose who had stood by Peel's side in the day of battle, and who still\r\nstood by him in the curious morrow that combined victorious policy with\r\npersonal defeat, were in more or less latent sympathy with the severed\r\nprotectionists in everything except protection.[208] Differing from\r\nthese, says Mr. Gladstone, others of the Peelites 'whose opinions were\r\nmore akin to those of the liberals, cherished, nevertheless, personal\r\nsympathies and lingering wishes which made them tardy, perhaps unduly\r\ntardy, in drawing towards that party. I think that this description\r\napplied in some degree to Mr. Sidney Herbert, and in the same or a\r\ngreater degree to myself.'[209]\r\n\r\nShortly described, the Peelites were all free trade conservatives, drawn\r\nby under-currents, according to temperament, circumstances, and all the\r\nother things that turn the balance of men's opinions, to antipodean\r\npoles of the political compass. 'We have no party,' Mr. Gladstone tells\r\nhis father in June 1849, 'no organisation, no whipper-in; and under\r\nthese circumstances we cannot exercise any considerable degree of\r\npermanent influence as a body.' The leading sentiment that guided the\r\nproceedings of the whole body of Peelites alike was a desire to give to\r\nprotection its final quietus. While the younger members of the Peel\r\ncabinet held that this could only be done in one way, namely, by\r\nforcing the protectionists into office where they must put their\r\nprofessions to the proof, Peel himself, and Graham with him, took a\r\ndirectly opposite view, and adopted as the leading principle of their\r\naction the vital necessity of keeping the protectionists out. This broad\r\ndifference led to no diminution of personal intercourse or political\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n     Certainly this was not due, says Mr. Gladstone, to any desire (at\r\n     least in Sir R. Peel's mind) for, or contemplation of, coalition\r\n     with the liberal party. It sprang entirely from a belief on his\r\n     part that the chiefs of the protectionists would on their accession\r\n     to power endeavour to establish a policy in accordance with the\r\n     designation of their party, and would in so doing probably convulse\r\n     the country. As long as Lord George Bentinck lived, with his iron\r\n     will and strong convictions, this was a contingency that could not\r\n     be overlooked. But he died in 1848, and with his death it became a\r\n     visionary dream. Yet I remember well Sir Robert Peel saying to me,\r\n     when I was endeavouring to stir him up on some great fault (as I\r\n     thought it), in the colonial policy of the ministers, 'I foresee a\r\n     tremendous struggle in this country for the restoration of\r\n     protection.' He would sometimes even threaten us with the\r\n     possibility of being 'sent for' if a crisis should occur, which was\r\n     a thing far enough from our limited conceptions. We were flatly at\r\n     issue with him on this opinion. We even considered that as long as\r\n     the protectionists had no responsibilities but those of opposition,\r\n     and as there were two hundred and fifty seats in parliament to be\r\n     won by chanting the woes of the land and promising redress, there\r\n     would be protectionists in plenty to fill the left hand benches on\r\n     those terms.\r\n\r\n                        RELATIONS WITH PEEL\r\n\r\nThe question what it was that finally converted the country to free\r\ntrade is not easy to answer. Not the arguments of Cobden, for in the\r\nsummer of 1845 even his buoyant spirit perceived that some precipitating\r\nevent, and not reasoning, would decide. His appeals had become, as\r\nDisraeli wrote, both to nation and parliament a wearisome iteration, and\r\nhe knew it. Those arguments, it is true, had laid the foundations of the\r\ncase in all their solidity and breadth. But until the emergency in\r\nIreland presented itself, and until prosperity had justified the\r\nexperiment, Peel was hardly wrong in reckoning on the possibility of a\r\nprotectionist reaction. Even the new prosperity and contentment of the\r\ncountry were capable of being explained by the extraordinary employment\r\nfound in the creation of railways. As Mr. Gladstone said to a\r\ncorrespondent in the autumn of 1846, 'The liberal proceedings of\r\nconservative governments, and the conservative proceedings of the new\r\nliberal administration, unite in pointing to the propriety of an\r\nabstinence from high-pitched opinions.' This was a euphemism. What it\r\nreally meant was that outside of protection no high-pitched opinions on\r\nany other subject were available. The tenets of party throughout this\r\nembarrassed period from 1846 to 1852 were shifting, equivocal, and\r\nfluid. Nor even in the period that followed did they very rapidly\r\nconsolidate.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone writes to his father (June 30, 1849):--\r\n\r\n     I will only add a few words about your desire that I should\r\n     withdraw my confidence from Peel. My feelings of admiration,\r\n     attachment, and gratitude to him I do not expect to lose; and I\r\n     agree with Graham that he has done more and _suffered_ more than\r\n     any other living statesman for the good of the people. But still I\r\n     must confess with sorrow that the present course of events tends to\r\n     separate and disorganise the small troop of the late government and\r\n     their adherents. On the West Indian question last year I, with\r\n     others, spoke and voted against Peel. On the Navigation law this\r\n     year I was saved from it only by the shipowners and their friends,\r\n     who would not adopt a plan upon the basis I proposed. Upon\r\n     Canada--a vital question--I again spoke and voted against him.[210]\r\n     And upon other colonial questions, yet most important to the\r\n     government, I fear even this year the same thing may happen again.\r\n     However painful, then, it may be to me to differ from him, it is\r\n     plain that my conduct is not placed in his hands to govern.\r\n\r\nWe find an illustration of the distractions of this long day of party\r\nmetamorphosis, as well as an example of what was regarded as Mr.\r\nGladstone's over-ingenuity, in one among other passing divergences\r\nbetween him and his chief. Mr. Disraeli brought forward a motion (Feb.\r\n19, 1850) of a very familiar kind, on the distress of the agricultural\r\nclasses and the insecurity of relief of rural burdens. Bright bluntly\r\ndenied that there was a case in which the fee of land had been\r\ndepreciated or rent been permanently lowered. Graham said the mover's\r\npolicy was simply a transfer of the entire poor rate to the consolidated\r\nfund, violating the principles of local control and inviting prodigal\r\nexpenditure. Fortune then, in Mr. Disraeli's own language, sent him an\r\nunexpected champion, by whom, according to him, Graham was fairly\r\nunhorsed. The reader will hardly think so, for though the unexpected\r\nchampion was Mr. Gladstone, he found no better reason for supporting the\r\nmotion, than that its adoption would weaken the case for restoring\r\nprotection. As if the landlords and farmers were likely to be satisfied\r\nwith a small admission of a great claim, while all the rest of their\r\nclaim was to be as bitterly contested as ever; with the transfer of a\r\nshabby couple of millions from their own shoulders to the consolidated\r\nfund, when they were clamouring that fourteen millions would hardly be\r\nenough. Peel rose later, promptly took this plain point against his\r\ningenious lieutenant, and then proceeded to one more of his elaborate\r\ndefences, both of free trade and of his own motives and character. For\r\nthe last time, as it was to happen, Peel declared that for Mr. Gladstone\r\nhe had 'the greatest respect and admiration.' 'I was associated with him\r\nin the preparation and conduct of those measures, to the desire of\r\nmaintaining which he partly attributes the conclusion at which he has\r\narrived. I derived from him the most zealous, the most effective\r\nassistance, and it is no small consolation to me to hear from him,\r\nalthough in this particular motion we arrive at different conclusions,\r\nthat his confidence in the justice of those principles for which we in\r\ncommon contended remains entirely unshaken.'[211]\r\n\r\n                           ON HIS POSITION\r\n\r\nOn this particular battle, as well as on more general matter, a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone to his wife (Feb. 22,1850) sheds some light:--:\r\n\r\n                         _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     Indeed you do rise to very daring flights to-day, and suggest many\r\n     things that flow from your own deep affection which, perhaps,\r\n     disguises from you some things that are nevertheless real. I cannot\r\n     form to myself any other conception of my duty in parliament except\r\n     the simple one of acting independently, without faction, and\r\n     without subserviency, on all questions as they arise. To the\r\n     formation of a party, or even of the nucleus of a party, there are\r\n     in my circumstances many obstacles. I have been talking over these\r\n     matters with Manning this morning, and I found him to be of the\r\n     opinion which is deliberately mine, namely, that it is better that\r\n     I should not be the head or leader even of my own contemporaries;\r\n     that there are others of them whose position is less embarrassed,\r\n     and more favourable and powerful, particularly from birth or wealth\r\n     or both. Three or four years ago, before I had much considered the\r\n     matter, and while we still felt as if Peel were our actual chief in\r\n     politics, I did not think so, but perhaps thought or assumed that\r\n     as, up to the then present time, I had discharged some prominent\r\n     duties in office and in parliament, the first place might naturally\r\n     fall to me when the other men were no longer in the van. But since\r\n     we have become more disorganised, and I have had little sense of\r\n     union except with the men of my own standing, and I have _felt_\r\n     more of the actual state of things, and how this or that would work\r\n     in the House of Commons, I have come to be satisfied in my own mind\r\n     that, if there were a question whether there should be a leader and\r\n     who it should be, it would be much better that either Lincoln or\r\n     Herbert should assume that post, whatever share of the mere work\r\n     might fall on me. I have viewed the matter very drily, and so\r\n     perhaps you will think I have written on it.\r\n\r\n    To turn then to what is more amusing, the battle of last night.\r\n    After much consideration and conference with Herbert (who has had an\r\n    attack of bilious fever and could not come down, though much better,\r\n    and soon, I hope, to be out again, but who agreed with me), I\r\n    determined that I ought to vote last night with Disraeli; and made\r\n    up my mind accordingly, which involved saying why, at some period of\r\n    the night. I was anxious to do it early, as I knew Graham would\r\n    speak on the other side, and did not wish any conflict even of\r\n    reasoning with him. But he found I was going to speak, and I suppose\r\n    may have had some similar wish. At any rate, he had the opportunity\r\n    of following Stafford who began the debate, as he was to take the\r\n    other side. Then there was an amusing scene between him and Peel.\r\n    Both rose and stood in competition for the Speaker's eye. The\r\n    Speaker had seen Graham first, and he got it. But when he was\r\n    speaking I felt I had no choice but to follow him. He made so very\r\n    able a speech that this was no pleasant prospect; but I acquired the\r\n    courage that proceeds from fear, according to a line from Ariosto:\r\n    _Chi per virtu, chi per paura vale_ [one from valour, another from\r\n    fear, is strong], and made my plunge when he sat down. But the\r\n    Speaker was not dreaming of me, and called a certain Mr. Scott who\r\n    had risen at the same time. Upon this I sat down again, and there\r\n    was a great uproar because the House always anticipating more or\r\n    less interest when men speak on opposite sides and in succession,\r\n    who are usually together, called for me. So I was up again, and the\r\n    Speaker deserted Scott and called me, and I had to make the best I\r\n    could after Graham. That is the end of the story, for there is\r\n    nothing else worth saying. It was at the dinner hour from 7 to\r\n    73/4, and then I went home for a little quiet. Peel again replied\r\n    upon me, but I did not hear that part of him; and Disraeli showed\r\n    the marvellous talent that he has, for summing up with brilliancy,\r\n    buoyancy, and comprehensiveness at the close of a debate. You have\r\n    heard me speak of that talent before when I have been wholly against\r\n    him; but never, last night or at any other time, would I go to him\r\n    for conviction, but for the delight of the ear and the fancy. What a\r\n    long story!\r\n\r\n                         PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL\r\n\r\nDuring the parliament that sat from 1847 to 1852, Mr. Gladstone's\r\npolitical life was in partial abeyance. The whole burden of conducting\r\nthe affairs of the Hawarden estate fell upon him. For five years, he\r\nsaid, 'it constituted my daily and continuing care, while parliamentary\r\naction was only occasional. It supplied in fact my education for the\r\noffice of finance minister.' The demands of church matters were anxious\r\nand at times absorbing. He warmly favoured and spoke copiously for the\r\nrepeal of the navigation laws. He desired, however, to accept a recent\r\noverture from America which offered everything, even their vast coasting\r\ntrade, upon a footing of absolute reciprocity. 'I gave notice,' he says,\r\n'of a motion to that effect. But the government declined to accept it. I\r\naccordingly withdrew it. At this the tories were much put about. I, who\r\nhad thought of things only and not taken persons into view, was\r\nsurprised at their surprise. It did not occur to me that by my public\r\nnotification I had given to the opposition generally something _like_ a\r\nvested interest in my proposal. I certainly should have done better\r\nnever to have given my notice. This is one of the cases illustrating the\r\nextreme slowness of my political education.' The sentence about thinking\r\nof things only and leaving persons out, indicates a turn of mind that\r\npartly for great good, partly for some evil, never wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\nYet partially withdrawn as he was from active life in the House of\r\nCommons, Mr. Gladstone was far too acute an observer to have any\r\nleanings to the delusive self-indulgence of temporary retirements. To\r\nhis intimate friend, Sir Walter James, who seems to have nursed some\r\nsuch intention, he wrote at this very time (Feb. 13, 1847):--\r\n\r\n     The way to make parliament profitable is to deal with it as a\r\n     calling, and if it be a calling it can rarely be advantageous to\r\n     suspend the pursuit of it for years together with an uncertainty,\r\n     too, as to its resumption. You have not settled in the country, nor\r\n     got your other vocation open and your line clear before you. The\r\n     purchase of an estate is a very serious matter, which you may not\r\n     be able to accomplish to your satisfaction except after the lapse\r\n     of years. It would be more satisfactory to drop parliament with\r\n     another path open to you already, than in order to seek about for\r\n     one.... I think with you that the change in the position of the\r\n     conservative party makes public life still more painful where it\r\n     was painful before, and less enjoyable, where it was enjoyable; but\r\n     I do not think it remains less a duty to work through the tornado\r\n     and to influence for good according to our means the new forms\r\n     into which, political combination may be cast.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Northcote speaks of Mr. Gladstone as the 'patron saint' of the\r\ncoal-whippers, who, as a manifestation of their gratitude for the Act\r\nwhich he had induced parliament to pass for them, offered their services\r\nto put down the chartist mob. Both Mr. Gladstone and his brother John\r\nserved as special constables during the troubled days of April. In his\r\ndiary he records on April 10, 'On duty from 2 to 33/4 P.M.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                      VIEWS OF COLONIAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone became colonial secretary at the end of 1845, he was\r\ndescribed as a strong accession to the progressive or theorising section\r\nof the cabinet--the men, that is to say, who applied to the routine of\r\ngovernment, as they found it, critical principles and improved ideals.\r\nIf the church had been the first of Mr. Gladstone's commanding interests\r\nand free trade the second, the turn of the colonies came next. He had\r\nnot held the seals of the colonial department for more than a few\r\nmonths, but to any business, whatever it might be, that happened to\r\nkindle his imagination or work on his reflection, he never failed to\r\nbend his whole strength. He had sat upon a committee in 1835-6 on native\r\naffairs at the Cape, and there he had come into full view of the costly\r\nand sanguinary nature of that important side of the colonial question.\r\nMolesworth mentions the 'prominent and valuable' part taken by him in\r\nthe committee on Waste Lands (1836). He served on committees upon\r\nmilitary expenditure in the colonies, and upon colonial accounts. He was\r\na member of the important committee of 1840 on the colonisation of New\r\nZealand, and voted in the minority for the draft report of the chairman,\r\ncontaining among other things the principle of the reservation of all\r\nunoccupied lands to the crown.[212] Between 1837 and 1841 he spoke\r\nfrequently on colonial affairs. When he was secretary of state in 1846,\r\nquestions arose upon the legal status of colonial clergy, full of knotty\r\npoints as to which he wrote minutes; questions upon education in penal\r\nsettlements, and so forth, in which he interested himself, not seldom\r\ndiffering from Stephen, the chief of the staff in the office. He\r\ncomposed an argumentative despatch on the commercial relations between\r\nCanada and the mother country, endeavouring to wean the Canadian\r\nassembly from its economic delusions. It was in effect little better\r\nthan if written in water. He made the mistake of sending out despatches\r\nin favour of resuming on a limited scale the transportation of convicts\r\nto Australia, a practice effectually condemned by the terrible committee\r\neight years before. Opinion in Australia was divided, Robert Lowe\r\nleading the opposition,[213] and the experiment was vetoed by Mr.\r\nGladstone's successor at the colonial office. He exposed himself to\r\ncriticism and abuse by recalling a colonial governor for inefficiency in\r\nhis post; imprudently in the simplicity of his heart he added to the\r\nrecall a private letter stating rumours against the governor's personal\r\ncharacter. These he had taken on trust from the bishop of the diocese\r\nand others. The bishop left him in the lurch; the recall was one affair,\r\nthe personal rumours were another; nimble partizanship confused the two,\r\nto the disadvantage of the secretary of state; the usual clatter that\r\nattends any important personage in a trivial scrape ensued; Mr.\r\nGladstone's explanations, simple and veracious as the sunlight in their\r\nsubstance, were over-skilful in form, and half a dozen blunt, sound\r\nsentences would have stood him in far better stead. 'There was on my\r\npart in this matter,' he says in a fugitive scrap upon it, 'a singular\r\nabsence of worldly wisdom.'[214] To colonial policy at this stage I\r\ndiscern no particular contribution, and the matters that I have named\r\nare now well covered with the moss of kindly time.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first he was convinced that some leading maxims of\r\nDowning Street were erroneous. He had, from his earliest parliamentary\r\ndays, regarded our colonial connection as one of duty rather than as one\r\nof advantage. When he had only been four years in the House he took a\r\nfirm stand against pretensions in Canada to set their assembly on an\r\nequal footing with the imperial parliament at home.[215] On the other\r\nhand, while he should always be glad to see parliament inclined to make\r\nlarge sacrifices for the purpose of maintaining the colonies, he\r\nconceived that nothing could be more ridiculous, or more mistaken, than\r\nto suppose that Great Britain had anything to gain by maintaining that\r\nunion in opposition to the deliberate and permanent conviction of the\r\npeople of the colonies themselves.[216]\r\n\r\nHe did not at all undervalue what he called the mere political\r\nconnection, but he urged that the root of such a connection lay in the\r\nnatural affection of the colonies for the land from which they sprang,\r\nand their spontaneous desire to reproduce its laws and the spirit of its\r\ninstitutions. From first to last he always declared the really valuable\r\ntie with a colony to be the moral and the social tie.[217] The master\r\nkey with him was local freedom, and he was never weary of protest\r\nagainst the fallacy of what was called 'preparing' these new communities\r\nfor freedom: teaching a colony, like an infant, by slow degrees to walk,\r\nfirst putting it into long clothes, then into short clothes. A governing\r\nclass was reared up for the purposes which the colony ought to fulfil\r\nitself; and, as the climax of the evil, a great military expenditure was\r\nmaintained, which became a premium on war. Our modern colonists, he\r\nsaid, after quitting the mother country, instead of keeping their\r\nhereditary liberties, go out to Australia or New Zealand to be deprived\r\nof these liberties, and then perhaps, after fifteen or twenty or thirty\r\nyears' waiting, have a portion given back to them, with magnificent\r\nlanguage about the liberality of parliament in conceding free\r\ninstitutions. During the whole of that interval they are condemned to\r\nhear all the miserable jargon about fitting them for the privileges thus\r\nconferred; while, in point of fact, every year and every month during\r\nwhich they are retained under the administration of a despotic\r\ngovernment, renders them less fit for free institutions. 'No\r\nconsideration of money ought to induce parliament to sever the\r\nconnection between any one of the colonies and the mother country,'\r\nthough it was certain that the cost of the existing system was both\r\nlarge and unnecessary. But the real mischief was not here, he said. Our\r\nerror lay in the attempt to hold the colonies by the mere exercise of\r\npower.[218] Even for the church in the colonies he rejected the boon of\r\ncivil preference as being undoubtedly a fatal gift,--'nothing but a\r\nsource of weakness to the church herself and of discord and difficulty\r\nto the colonial communities, in the soil of which I am anxious to see\r\nthe church of England take a strong and healthy root.'[219] He\r\nacknowledged how much he had learned from Molesworth's speeches,[220]\r\nand neither of them sympathised with the opinion expressed by Mr.\r\nDisraeli in those days, 'These wretched colonies will all be independent\r\ntoo in a few years, and are a millstone round our necks.'[221] Nor did\r\nMr. Gladstone share any such sentiments as those of Molesworth who, in\r\nthe Canadian revolt of the winter of 1837, actually invoked disaster\r\nupon the British arms.[222]\r\n\r\n                          THE TWO SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nIn their views of colonial policy Mr. Gladstone was in substantial\r\naccord with radicals of the school of Cobden, Hume, and Molesworth. He\r\ndoes not seem to have joined a reforming association founded by these\r\neminent men among others in 1850, but its principles coincided with his\r\nown:--local independence, an end of rule from Downing Street, the relief\r\nof the mother country from the whole expense of the local government of\r\nthe colonies, save for defence from aggression by a foreign power.\r\nParliament was, as a rule, so little moved by colonial concerns that,\r\naccording to Mr. Gladstone, in nine cases out of ten it was impossible\r\nfor the minister to secure parliamentary attention, and in the tenth\r\ncase it was only obtained by the casual operations of party spirit. Lord\r\nGlenelg's case showed that colonial secretaries were punished when they\r\ngot into bad messes, and his passion for messes was punished, in the\r\nlanguage of the journals of the day, by the life of a toad under a\r\nharrow until he was worried out of office. There was, however, no force\r\nin public opinion to prevent the minister from going wrong if he liked;\r\nstill less to prevent him from going right if he liked. Popular feeling\r\nwas coloured by no wish to give up the colonies, but people doubted\r\nwhether the sum of three millions sterling a year for colonial defence\r\nand half a million more for civil charges, was not excessive, and they\r\nthought the return by no means commensurate with the outlay.[223] In\r\ndiscussions on bills effecting the enlargement of Australian\r\nconstitutions, Mr. Gladstone's views came out in clear contrast with the\r\nold school. 'Spoke 11/2 hours on the Australian Colonies bill,' he records\r\n(May 13,1850), 'to an indifferent, inattentive House. But it is\r\nnecessary to speak these truths of colonial policy even to unwilling\r\nears.' In the proceedings on the constitution for New Zealand, he\r\ndelivered a speech justly described as a pattern of close argument and\r\nclassic oratory.[224] Lord John Russell, adverting to the concession of\r\nan elective chamber and responsible government, said that one by one in\r\nthis manner, all the shields of our authority were thrown away, and the\r\nmonarchy was left exposed in the colonies to the assaults of democracy.\r\n'Now I confess,' said Mr. Gladstone, in a counter minute, 'that the\r\nnominated council and the independent executive were, not shields of\r\nauthority, but sources of weakness, disorder, disunion, and\r\ndisloyalty.'[225]\r\n\r\n                            HIS WHOLE VIEW\r\n\r\nHis whole view he set out at Chester[226] a little later than the time\r\nat which we now stand:--\r\n\r\n     ... Experience has proved that if you want to strengthen the\r\n     connection between the colonies and this country--if you want to\r\n     see British law held in respect and British institutions adopted\r\n     and beloved in the colonies, never associate with them the hated\r\n     name of force and coercion exercised by us, at a distance, over\r\n     their rising fortunes. Govern them upon a principle of freedom.\r\n     Defend them against aggression from without. Regulate their foreign\r\n     relations. These things belong to the colonial connection. But of\r\n     the duration of that connection let them be the judges, and I\r\n     predict that if you leave them the freedom of judgment it is hard\r\n     to say when the day will come when they will wish to separate from\r\n     the great name of England. Depend upon it, they covet a share in\r\n     that great name. You will find in that feeling of theirs the\r\n     greatest security for the connection. Make the name of England yet\r\n     more and more an object of desire to the colonies. Their natural\r\n     disposition is to love and revere the name of England, and this\r\n     reverence is by far the best security you can have for their\r\n     continuing, not only to be subjects of the crown, not only to\r\n     render it allegiance, but to render it that allegiance which is the\r\n     most precious of all--the allegiance which proceeds from the depths\r\n     of the heart of man. You have seen various colonies, some of them\r\n     lying at the antipodes, offering to you their contributions to\r\n     assist in supporting the wives and families of your soldiers, the\r\n     heroes that have fallen in the war. This, I venture to say, may be\r\n     said, without exaggeration, to be among the first fruits of that\r\n     system upon which, within the last twelve or fifteen years, you\r\n     have founded a rational mode of administering the affairs of your\r\n     colonies without gratuitous interference.\r\n\r\nAs I turn over these old minutes, memoranda, despatches, speeches, one\r\nfeels a curious irony in the charge engendered by party heat or malice,\r\nstudiously and scandalously careless of facts, that Mr. Gladstone's\r\npolicy aimed at getting rid of the colonies. As if any other policy than\r\nthat which he so ardently enforced could possibly have saved them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                            A PAINFUL INCIDENT\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Mr. Gladstone was concerned in a painful incident that befel one\r\nof his nearest friends. Nobody of humane feeling would now willingly\r\nchoose either to speak or hear of it, but it finds a place in books even\r\nto this day; it has been often misrepresented; and it is so\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Gladstone, and so entirely to his honour, that it\r\ncannot be wholly passed over. Fortunately a few sentences will suffice.\r\nHis friend's wife had been for some time travelling abroad, and rumours\r\nby and by reached England of movements that might be no more than\r\nindiscreet, but might be worse. In consequence of these rumours, and\r\nafter anxious consultations between the husband and three or four\r\nimportant members of his circle, it was thought best that some one\r\nshould seek access to the lady, and try to induce her to place herself\r\nin a position of security. The further conclusion reached was that Mr.\r\nGladstone and Manning were the two persons best qualified by character\r\nand friendship for this critical mission. Manning was unable to go, but\r\nMr. Gladstone at the earnest solicitation of his friend, and also of his\r\nown wife who had long been much attached to the person missing, set off\r\nalone for a purpose, as he conscientiously believed, alike friendly to\r\nboth parties and in the interests of both. I have called the proceeding\r\ncharacteristic, for it was in fact exactly like him to be ready at the\r\ncall of friendship, and in the hope of preventing a terrible disaster,\r\ncheerfully to undertake a duty detestable to anybody and especially\r\ndetestable to him; and again, it was like him to regard the affair with\r\nan optimistic simplicity that made him hopeful of success, where to\r\nninety-nine men of a hundred the thought of success would have seemed\r\nabsurd. To no one was it a greater shock than to him when, after a\r\njourney across half Europe, he suddenly found himself the discoverer of\r\nwhat it was inevitable that he should report to his friend at home. In\r\nthe course of the subsequent proceedings on the bill for a divorce\r\nbrought into the House of Lords, he was called as a witness to show that\r\nin this case the person claiming the bill had omitted no means that duty\r\nor affection could suggest for averting the calamity with which his\r\nhearth was threatened. It was quite untrue, as he had occasion to tell\r\nthe House of Commons in 1857, that he had anything whatever to do with\r\nthe collection of evidence, or that the evidence given by him was the\r\nevidence, or any part of it, on which the divorce was founded. The only\r\nthing to be added is the judgment of Sir Robert Peel upon a transaction,\r\nwith all the details of which he was particularly well acquainted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _Aug. 26, 1849._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR GLADSTONE,--I am deeply concerned to hear the result of\r\n     that mission which, with unparalleled kindness and generosity, you\r\n     undertook in the hope of mitigating the affliction of a friend, and\r\n     conducing possibly to the salvation of a wife and mother. Your\r\n     errand has not been a fruitless one, for it affords the conclusive\r\n     proof that everything that the forbearance and tender consideration\r\n     of a husband and the devotion of a friend could suggest as the\r\n     means of averting the necessity for appealing to the Law for such\r\n     protection as it can afford, had been essayed and essayed with the\r\n     utmost delicacy. This proof is valuable so far as the world and the\r\n     world's opinion is concerned--much more valuable as it respects the\r\n     heart and conscience of those who have been the active agents in a\r\n     work of charity. I can offer you nothing in return for that which\r\n     you undertook with the promptitude of affectionate friendship,\r\n     under circumstances which few would not have considered a valid\r\n     excuse if not a superior obligation, but the expression of my\r\n     sincere admiration for truly virtuous and generous conduct.--Ever,\r\n     my dear Gladstone, most faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                       ROBERT PEEL.\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[207] _The Halifax Papers._\r\n\r\n[208] Among them were such men as Wilson Patten, General Peel, Mr.\r\nCorry, Lord Stanhope, Lord Hardinge, most of whom in days to come took\r\ntheir places in conservative administrations.\r\n\r\n[209] Memo, of 1876.\r\n\r\n[210] A bill to indemnify the inhabitants of Lower Canada, many of whom\r\nhad taken part in the rebellion of 1837-8, for the destruction and\r\ninjury of their property.

After a long spell of\r\npeace, earnestness, and political economy, the nation was for a time in\r\na mood for change, and Palmerston convinced it that he was the man for\r\nits mood. He had his full share of shrewd common sense, yet was capable\r\nof infinite recklessness. He was good-tempered and a man of bluff\r\ncheerful humour. But to lose the game was intolerable, and it was\r\nnoticed that with him the next best thing to success was quick\r\nretaliation on a victorious adversary--a trait of which he was before\r\nlong to give the world an example that amused it. Yet he had no capacity\r\nfor deep and long resentments. Like so many of his class, he united\r\npassion for public business to sympathy with social gaiety and pleasure.\r\nDiplomatists found him firm, prompt, clean-cut, but apt to be narrow,\r\nteasing, obstinate, a prisoner to his own arguments, and wanting in the\r\nstatesman's first quality of seeing the whole and not merely the half.\r\nMetternich described him as an audacious and passionate marksman, ready\r\nto make arrows out of any wood. He was a sanguine man who always\r\nbelieved what he desired; a confident man who was sure that he must be\r\nright in whatever he chose to fear. On the economic or the moral side of\r\nnational life, in the things that make a nation rich and the things that\r\nmake it scrupulous and just, he had only limited perception and moderate\r\nfaith. Where Peel was strong and penetrating, Palmerston was weak and\r\npurblind. He regarded Bright and Cobden as displeasing mixtures of the\r\nbagman and the preacher. In 1840 he had brought us within an ace of war\r\nwith France. Disputes about an American frontier were bringing us at the\r\nsame period within an ace of war with the United States. When Peel and\r\nAberdeen got this quarrel into more promising shape, Palmerston\r\ncharacteristically taunted them with capitulation. Lord Grey refused\r\nhelp in manufacturing a whig government in December 1845, because he was\r\nconvinced that at that moment Palmerston at the foreign office meant an\r\nAmerican war. When he was dismissed by Lord John Russell in 1852 a\r\nforeign ruler on an insecure throne observed to an Englishman, 'This is\r\na blow to me, for so long as Lord Palmerston remained at the foreign\r\noffice, it was certain that you could not procure a single ally in\r\nEurope.'\r\n\r\nYet all this policy of high spirits and careless dictatorial temper had\r\nits fine side. With none of the grandeur of the highest heroes of his\r\nschool--of Chatham, Carteret, Pitt--without a spark of their heroic fire\r\nor their brilliant and steadfast glow, Palmerston represented, not\r\nalways in their best form, some of the most generous instincts of his\r\ncountrymen. A follower of Canning, he was the enemy of tyrants and\r\nforeign misrule. He had a healthy hatred of the absolutism and reaction\r\nthat were supreme at Vienna in 1815; and if he meddled in many affairs\r\nthat were no affairs of ours, at least he intervened for freedom. The\r\naction that made him hated at Vienna and Petersburg won the confidence\r\nof his countrymen. They saw him in Belgium and Holland, Spain, Italy,\r\nGreece, Portugal, the fearless champion of constitutions and\r\nnationality. Of Aberdeen, who had been Peel's foreign minister, it was\r\nsaid that at home he was a liberal without being an enthusiast; abroad\r\nhe was a zealot, in the sense most opposed to Palmerston. So, of\r\nPalmerston it could be said that he was conservative at home and\r\nrevolutionist abroad. If such a word can ever be applied to such a\r\nthing, his patriotism was sometimes not without a tinge of vulgarity,\r\nbut it was always genuine and sincere.\r\n\r\nThis masterful and expert personage was the ruling member of the weak\r\nwhig government now in office, and he made sensible men tremble. Still,\r\nsaid Graham to Peel, 'it is a choice of dangers and evils, and I am\r\ndisposed to think that Palmerston and his foreign policy are less to be\r\ndreaded than Stanley and a new corn law.'[227] In a debate of\r\nextraordinary force and range in the summer of 1850, the two schools of\r\nforeign policy found themselves face to face. Palmerston defended his\r\nvarious proceedings with remarkable amplitude, power, moderation, and\r\nsincerity. He had arrayed against him, besides Mr. Gladstone, the\r\ngreatest men in the House--Peel, Disraeli, Cobden, Graham, Bright--but\r\nin his last sentence the undaunted minister struck a note that made\r\ntriumph in the division lobbies sure. For five hours a crowded house\r\nhung upon his lips, and he then wound up with a fearless challenge of a\r\nverdict on the question, 'Whether, as the Roman in days of old held\r\nhimself free from indignity when he could say _Civis Romanus sum_, so\r\nalso a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident\r\nthat the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him\r\nagainst injustice and wrong?'\r\n\r\n                             DON PACIFICO\r\n\r\nThe Roman citizen was in this instance a Mediterranean Jew who chanced\r\nto be a British subject. His house at Athens had for some reason or\r\nother been sacked by the mob; he presented a demand for compensation\r\nabsurdly fraudulent on the face of it. The Greek government refused to\r\npay. England despatched the fleet to collect this and some other petty\r\naccounts outstanding. Russia and France proposed their good offices; the\r\nmediation of France was accepted; then a number of Greek vessels were\r\nperemptorily seized, and France in umbrage recalled her ambassador from\r\nLondon. Well might Peel, in the last speech ever delivered by him in the\r\nHouse of Commons, describe such a course of action as consistent neither\r\nwith the dignity nor the honour of England. The debate travelled far\r\nbeyond Don Pacifico, and it stands to this day as a grand classic\r\nexposition in parliament of the contending views as to the temper and\r\nthe principles on which nations in our modern era should conduct their\r\ndealings with one another.\r\n\r\n     It was in the Greek debate of 1850, which involved the censure or\r\n     acquittal of Lord Palmerston, that I first meddled in speech with\r\n     foreign affairs, to which I had heretofore paid the slightest\r\n     possible attention. Lord Palmerston's speech was a marvel for\r\n     physical strength, for memory, and for lucid and precise exposition\r\n     of his policy as a whole. A very curious incident on this occasion\r\n     evinced the extreme reluctance of Sir R. Peel to appear in any\r\n     ostensible relation with Disraeli. Voting with him was disagreeable\r\n     enough, but this with his strong aversion to the Palmerstonian\r\n     policy Peel could not avoid; besides which, it was known that Lord\r\n     Palmerston would carry the division. Disraeli, not yet fully\r\n     recognised as leader of the protectionists, was working hard for\r\n     that position, and assumed the manners of it, with Beresford, a\r\n     kind of whipper-in, for his right-hand man. After the Palmerston\r\n     speech he asked me on the next night whether I would undertake to\r\n     answer it. I said that I was incompetent to do it, from want of\r\n     knowledge and otherwise. He answered that in that case he must do\r\n     it. As the debate was not to close that evening, this left another\r\n     night free for Peel when he might speak and _not_ be in Disraeli's\r\n     _neighbourhood_. I told Peel what Disraeli had arranged. He was\r\n     very well satisfied. But, shortly afterwards, I received from\r\n     Disraeli a message through Beresford, that he had changed his mind,\r\n     and would not speak until the next and closing night, when Peel\r\n     would have to speak also. I had to make known to Peel this\r\n     alteration. He received the tidings with extreme annoyance:\r\n     thinking, I suppose, that if the two spoke on the same side and in\r\n     the late hours just before the division it would convey the idea of\r\n     some concert or co-operation between them, which it was evident\r\n     that he was most anxious to avoid. But he could not help himself.\r\n     Disraeli's speech was a very poor one, almost like a 'cross,' and\r\n     Peel's was prudent but otherwise not one of his best.[228]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had not in 1850 at all acquired such full parliamentary\r\nascendency as belonged to the hardy veteran confronting him; still less\r\nhad he such authority as the dethroned leader who sat by his side. Yet\r\nthe House felt that, in the image of an ancient critic, here was no\r\ncistern of carefully collected rain-water, but the bounteous flow of a\r\nliving spring. It felt all the noble elevation of an orator who\r\ntransported them apart from the chicane of diplomatic chanceries, above\r\nthe narrow expediencies of the particular case, though of these too he\r\nproved himself a thoroughly well-armed master, into a full view of the\r\nstate system of Europe and of the principles and relations on which the\r\nfabric is founded. Now for the first time he made the appeal, so often\r\nrepeated by him, to the common sentiment of the civilised world, to the\r\ngeneral and fixed convictions of mankind, to the principles of\r\nbrotherhood among nations, to their sacred independence, to the equality\r\nin their rights of the weak with the strong. Such was his language.\r\n'When we are asking for the maintenance of the rights that belong to our\r\nfellow-subjects resident in Greece,' he said, '_let us do as we would be\r\ndone by_; let us pay all respect to a feeble state and to the infancy of\r\nfree institutions, which we should desire and should exact from others\r\ntowards their authority and strength.' Mr. Gladstone had not read\r\nhistory for nothing, he was not a Christian for nothing. He knew the\r\nevils that followed in Europe the breakdown of the great spiritual\r\npower--once, though with so many defects, a controlling force over\r\nviolence, anarchy, and brute wrong. He knew the necessity for some\r\nsubstitute, even a substitute so imperfect as the law of nations. 'You\r\nmay call the rule of nations vague and untrustworthy,' he exclaimed; 'I\r\nfind in it, on the contrary, a great and noble monument of human wisdom,\r\nfounded on the combined dictates of sound experience, a precious\r\ninheritance bequeathed to us by the generations that have gone before\r\nus, and a firm foundation on which we must take care to build whatever\r\nit may be our part to add to their acquisitions, if indeed we wish to\r\npromote the peace and welfare of the world.'\r\n\r\n                       EXALTS THE LAW OF NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe government triumphed by a handsome majority, and Mr. Gladstone, as\r\nwas his wont, consoled himself for present disappointment by hopes for a\r\nbetter future. 'The majority of the House of Commons, I am convinced,'\r\nhe wrote to Guizot, then in permanent exile from power, 'was with us in\r\nheart and in conviction; but fear of inconveniences attending the\r\nremoval of a ministry which there is no regularly organised opposition\r\nready to succeed, carried the day beyond all authoritative doubt,\r\nagainst the merits of the particular question. It remains to hope that\r\nthe demonstration which has been made may not be without its effect upon\r\nthe tone of Lord Palmerston's future proceedings.'\r\n\r\nThe conflict thus opened between Mr. Gladstone and Lord Palmerston in\r\n1850 went on in many changing phases, with some curious vicissitudes and\r\ninversions. They were sometimes frank foes, occasionally partners in\r\nopposition, and for a long while colleagues in office. Never at any time\r\nwere they in thought or feeling congenial.[229]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day following this debate, Peel was thrown from\r\nhis horse and received injuries from which he died three days later\r\n(July 2), in the sixty-third year of his age, and after forty-one years\r\nof parliamentary life. When the House met the next day, Hume, as one of\r\nits oldest members, at once moved the adjournment, and it fell to Mr.\r\nGladstone to second him. He was content with a few words of sorrow and\r\nwith the quotation of Scott's moving lines to the memory of Pitt:--\r\n\r\n  'Now is the stately column broke,\r\n   The beacon-light is quench'd in smoke,\r\n   The trumpet's silver sound is still,\r\n   The warder silent on the hill!'\r\n\r\nThese beautiful words were addressed, said Mr. Gladstone, 'to a man\r\ngreat indeed, but not greater than Sir Robert Peel.'\r\n\r\n'Great as he was to the last,' wrote Mr. Gladstone in one of his notes\r\nin 1851, 'I must consider the closing years of his life as beneath those\r\nthat had preceded them. His enormous energies were in truth so lavishly\r\nspent upon the gigantic work of government, which he conducted after a\r\nfashion quite different,--I mean as to the work done in the workshop of\r\nhis own brain,--from preceding and succeeding prime ministers, that\r\ntheir root was enfeebled, though in its feebleness it had more strength\r\nprobably remaining than fell to the lot of any other public man.'\r\n\r\nPeel may at least divide with Walpole the laurels of our greatest peace\r\nminister to that date--the man who presided over beneficent and\r\nnecessary changes in national polity, that in hands less strong and less\r\nskilful might easily have opened the sluices of civil confusion. And\r\nwhen we think of Walpole's closing days, and of the melancholy end of\r\nmost other ruling spirits in our political history--of the\r\nmortifications and disappointments in which, from Chatham and Pitt down\r\nto Canning and O'Connell, they have quitted the glorious field--Peel\r\nmust seem happy in the manner and moment of his death. Daring and\r\nprosperous legislative exploits had marked his path. His authority in\r\nparliament never stood higher, his honour in the country never stood so\r\nhigh. His last words had been a commanding appeal for temperance in\r\nnational action and language, a solemn plea for peace as the true aim to\r\nset before a powerful people.\r\n\r\nTo his father Mr. Gladstone wrote:--\r\n\r\n     _July 2, 1850._--I thought Sir R. Peel looked extremely feeble\r\n     during the debate last week. I mean as compared with what he\r\n     usually is. I observed that he slept during much of Lord\r\n     Palmerston's speech, that he spoke with little physical energy, and\r\n     next day, Saturday, in the forenoon I thought he looked very ill at\r\n     a meeting which, in common with him, I had to attend. This is all\r\n     that I know and that is worth telling on a subject which is one of\r\n     deep interest to all classes, from the Queen downwards. I was at\r\n     the palace last night and she spoke to me with great earnestness\r\n     about it. As to the division I shall say little; it is an\r\n     unsatisfactory subject. The majority of the government was made up\r\n     out of our ranks, partly by people staying away and partly by some\r\n     twenty who actually voted with the government. By far the greater\r\n     portion, I am sorry to say, of both sets of persons were what are\r\n     called Peelites, and not protectionists. The fact is, that if all\r\n     calling themselves liberal be put on one side, and all calling\r\n     themselves conservatives on the other, the House of Commons is as\r\n     nearly as possible _equally_ divided.\r\n\r\n                         QUESTIONS OF LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nI have already described how Mr. Gladstone thought it a great mistake in\r\nPeel to resist any step that might put upon the protectionists the\r\nresponsibilities of office. In a note composed a quarter of a century\r\nlater (1876), he says: 'This I think was not only a safe experiment\r\n(after 1848) but a vital necessity. I do not, therefore, think, and I\r\ndid not think, that the death of Sir R. Peel at the time when it\r\noccurred was a great calamity so far as the chief question of our\r\ninternal politics was concerned. In other respects it was indeed great;\r\nin some of them it may almost be called immeasurable. The moral\r\natmosphere of the House of Commons has never since his death been quite\r\nthe same, and is now widely different. He had a kind of authority there\r\nthat was possessed by no one else. Lord John might in some respects\r\ncompete with, in some even excel, him; but to him, as leader of the\r\nliberals, the loss of such an opponent was immense. It is sad to think\r\nwhat, with his high mental force and noble moral sense, he might have\r\ndone for us in after years. Even the afterthought of knowledge of such a\r\nman and of intercourse with him, is a high privilege and a precious\r\npossession.'\r\n\r\nAn interesting word or two upon his own position at this season occur in\r\na letter to his father (July 9, 1850):--\r\n\r\n     The letter in which you expressed a desire to be informed by me, so\r\n     far as I might be able to speak, whether there was anything in the\r\n     rumours circulated with regard to my becoming the leader in\r\n     parliament of the conservative party, did not come to my hands\r\n     until yesterday. The fact is, that there is nothing whatever in\r\n     those rumours beyond mere speculation on things supposed probable\r\n     or possible, and they must pass for what they are worth in that\r\n     character only. People feel, I suppose, that Sir Robert Peel's life\r\n     and continuance in parliament were of themselves powerful obstacles\r\n     to the general reorganisation of the conservative party, and as\r\n     there is great annoyance and dissatisfaction with the present state\r\n     of things, and a widely spread feeling that it is not conducive to\r\n     the public interests, there arises in men's minds an expectation\r\n     that the party will be in some manner reconstituted. I share in the\r\n     feeling that it is desirable; but I see very great difficulties in\r\n     the way, and do not at present see how they are to be effectually\r\n     overcome. The House of Commons is almost equally divided, indeed,\r\n     between those professing liberal and those professing conservative\r\n     politics; but the late division [Don Pacifico] showed how ill the\r\n     latter could hang together, even when all those who had any\r\n     prominent station among them in any sense were united....\r\n\r\nCornewall Lewis wrote,'Upon Gladstone the death of Peel will have the\r\neffect of removing a weight from a spring--he will come forward more and\r\ntake more part in discussion. The general opinion is that Gladstone will\r\nrenounce his free trade opinions, and become leader of the\r\nprotectionists. I expect neither the one event nor the other.'[230] More\r\ninteresting still is something told by the Duke of Buccleuch. 'Very\r\nshortly,' said the duke in 1851, 'before Sir Robert Peel's death, he\r\nexpressed to me his belief that Sidney Herbert or Gladstone would one\r\nday be premier; but Peel said with sarcasm, If the hour comes, Disraeli\r\nmust be made governor-general of India. He will be a second\r\nEllenborough.'[231]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[227] Parker, iii. p. 536.\r\n\r\n[228] Fragment of 1897.\r\n\r\n[229] Mr. Gladstone's Don Pacifico speech is still not quite out of\r\ndate.--June 27, _Hansard_, 1850.\r\n\r\n[230] _Letters_, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[231] Dean Boyle's _Recollections_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                   GORHAM CASE--SECESSION OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\n                            (_1847-1851_)\r\n\r\n     It is not by the State that man can be regenerated, and the\r\n     terrible woes of this darkened world effectually dealt\r\n     with.--GLADSTONE (1894).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test case of toleration at the moment of the Oxford election of 1847\r\nwas the admission of the Jews to sit in parliament, and in the last\r\nmonth of 1847 Mr. Gladstone astonished his father, as well as a great\r\nhost of his political supporters, by voting with the government in\r\nfavour of the removal of Jewish disabilities. No ordinary degree of\r\nmoral courage was needed for such a step by the member for such a\r\nconstituency. 'It is a painful decision to come to,' he writes in his\r\ndiary (Dec. 16), 'but the only substantive doubt it raises is about\r\nremaining in parliament, and it is truly and only the church which holds\r\nme there, though she may seem to some to draw me from it.' Pusey wrote\r\nto him in rather violent indignation, for Mr. Gladstone was the only man\r\nof that school who learned, or was able to learn, what the modern state\r\nis or is going to be. This was the third phase, so Gladstone argued, of\r\nan irresistible movement. The tory party had fought first for an\r\nanglican parliament, second they fought for a protestant parliament, and\r\nnow they were fighting for a Christian parliament. Parliament had ceased\r\nto be anglican and it had ceased to be protestant, and the\r\nconsiderations that supported these two earlier operations thenceforth\r\ncondemned the exclusion from full civil rights of those who were not\r\nChristians. To his father he explained (December 17, 1847): 'After much\r\nconsideration, prolonged indeed I may say for the last two years and a\r\nhalf, I made up my mind to support Lord John Russell's bill for the\r\nadmission of the Jews. I spoke to this effect last night. It is with\r\nreluctance that I give the vote, but I am convinced that after the civil\r\nprivileges we have given them already (including the magistracy and the\r\nfranchise), and after the admission we have already conceded to\r\nunitarians who refuse the whole of the most vital doctrines of the\r\nGospel, we cannot compatibly with entire justice and fairness refuse to\r\nadmit them.'\r\n\r\nHis father, who was sometimes exacting, complained of concealment. Mr.\r\nGladstone replied that he regarded the question as one of difficulty,\r\nand he therefore took as much time as he possibly could for reflection\r\nupon it, though he never intended to run it as close as it actually\r\ncame. 'I know,' he says, in a notable sentence, 'it seems strange to you\r\nthat I should find it necessary to hold my judgment in suspense on a\r\nquestion which seemed to many so plain; _but suspense is of constant\r\noccurrence in public life upon very many kinds of questions, and without\r\nit errors and inconsistencies would be much more frequent than even they\r\nare now_.' This did not satisfy his father. 'I shall certainly read your\r\nspeech to find some fair apology for your vote: good and satisfactory\r\nreason I do not expect. I cannot doubt you thought you withheld your\r\nopinions from me under the undecided state you were in, without any\r\nintention whatever to annoy me. There is, however, a natural closeness\r\nin your disposition, with a reserve towards those who may think they may\r\nhave some claim to your confidence, probably increased by official\r\nhabits, which it may perhaps in some cases be worth your inquiring\r\ninto.' The sentence above about suspense is a key to many\r\nmisunderstandings of Mr. Gladstone's character. His stouthearted friend\r\nThomas Acland had warned him, for the sake of his personal influence, to\r\nbe sure to deal with the Jew question on broad grounds, without\r\nrefining, and without dragging out some recondite view not seen by\r\ncommon men, 'in short, to be _as little as possible like Maurice, and\r\nmore like the Duke of Wellington_.' 'My speech,' Mr. Gladstone answered,\r\n'was most unsatisfactory in many ways, but I do not believe that it\r\nmystified or puzzled anybody.'\r\n\r\n                        JEWISH DISABILITIES\r\n\r\nThe following year he received the honour of a D.C.L. degree at Oxford.\r\nMrs. Gladstone was there, he tells his father, and 'was well satisfied\r\nwith my reception, though it is not to be denied that my vote upon the\r\nJew bill is upon the whole unpalatable there, and they had been provoked\r\nby a paragraph in the _Globe_ newspaper stating that I was to have the\r\ndegree, and that this made it quite clear that the minority was not\r\nunfavourable to the Jew bill.'\r\n\r\n     _July 5._--I went off after breakfast to Oxford. Joined the V.-C.\r\n     and doctors in the hall at Wadham, and went in procession to the\r\n     Divinity schools provided with a white neckcloth by Sir R. Inglis,\r\n     who seized me at the station in horror and alarm when he saw me\r\n     with a black one. In due time we were summoned to the theatre where\r\n     my degree had been granted with some _non placets_ but with no\r\n     scrutiny. The scene remarkable to the eye and mind, so pictorial\r\n     and so national. There was great tumult about me, the hisses being\r\n     obstinate, and the _fautores_ also very generous. 'Gladstone and\r\n     the Jew bill' came sometimes from the gallery, sometimes more\r\n     favouring sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nAfter the whig government was formed in 1846, Mr. Gladstone expressed\r\nhimself as having little fear that they could do much harm, 'barring\r\nchurch patronage.' He was soon justified in his own eyes in this\r\nlimitation of his confidence, for the next year Dr. Hampden was made a\r\nbishop.[232] This was a rude blow both to the university which had\r\neleven years before pronounced him heretical, and to the bishops who now\r\nbitterly and fervidly remonstrated. Grave points of law were raised, but\r\nMr. Gladstone, though warmly reprobating the prime minister's\r\nrecommendation of a divine so sure to raise the hurricane, took no\r\nleading part in the strife that followed. 'Never in my opinion,' he said\r\nto his father (Feb. 2, 1848), 'was a firebrand more wantonly and\r\ngratuitously cast.' It was an indication the more of a determination to\r\nsubstitute a sort of general religion for the doctrines of the church.\r\nThe next really marking incident after the secession of Newman was a\r\ndecision of a court of law, known as the Gorham judgment. This and the\r\npreferment of Hampden to his bishopric produced the second great tide of\r\nsecession. 'Were we together,' Mr. Gladstone writes to Manning at the\r\nend of 1849 (December 30), 'I should wish to converse with you from\r\nsunrise to sunset on the Gorham case. It is a stupendous issue. Perhaps\r\nthey will evade it. On abstract grounds this would be still more\r\ndistasteful than a decision of the state against a catholic doctrine.\r\nBut what I feel is that as a body we are not ready yet for the last\r\nalternatives. More years must elapse from the secession of Newman and\r\nthe group of secessions which, following or preceding, belonged to it. A\r\nmore composed and settled state of the public mind in regard to our\r\nrelations with the church of Rome must supervene. There must be more\r\nyears of faithful _work_ for the church to point to in argument, and to\r\ngrow into her habits. And besides all these very needful conditions of\r\npreparation for a crisis, I want to see the question more fully\r\nanswered, What will the state of its own free and good will do, or allow\r\nto be done, for the church while yet in alliance with it?'\r\n\r\nThe Gorham case was this: a bishop refused to institute a clergyman to a\r\nvicarage in the west of England, on the ground of unsound doctrine upon\r\nregeneration by baptism. The clergyman sought a remedy in the\r\necclesiastical court of Arches. The judge decided against him. The case\r\nthen came on appeal before the judicial committee of the privy council,\r\nand here a majority with the two archbishops as assessors reversed the\r\ndecision of the court below. The bishop, one of the most combative of\r\nthe human race, flew to Westminster Hall, tried move upon move in\r\nqueen's bench, exchequer, common pleas; declared that his archbishop had\r\nabused his high commission; and even actually renounced communion with\r\nhim. But the sons of Zeruiah were too hard. The religious world in both\r\nof its two standing camps was convulsed, for if Gorham had lost the day\r\nit would or might have meant the expulsion from the establishment of\r\ncalvinists and evangelicals bag and baggage. 'I am old enough,' said the\r\nprovost of Oriel, 'to remember three baptismal controversies, and this\r\nis the first in which one party has tried to eject the other from the\r\nchurch.' On the other hand the sacramental wing found it intolerable\r\nthat fundamental doctrines of the church should be settled under the\r\nveil of royal supremacy, by a court possessed of no distinctly church\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n                             THE JUDGMENT\r\n\r\nThe judgment was declared on March 8 (1850), and Manning is made to tell\r\na vivid story about going to Mr. Gladstone's house, finding him ill with\r\ninfluenza, sitting down by his bedside and telling him what the court\r\nhad done; whereon Mr. Gladstone started up, threw out his arms and\r\nexclaimed that the church of England was gone unless it relieved itself\r\nby some authoritative act. A witty judge once observed in regard to the\r\npractice of keeping diaries, that it was wise to keep diary enough at\r\nany rate to prove an _alibi_. According to Mr. Gladstone's diary he was\r\nnot laid up until several days later, when he did see various people,\r\nManning included, in his bedroom. On the black day of the judgment,\r\nhaving dined at the palace the night before, and having friends to dine\r\nwith him on this night, he records a busy day, including a morning spent\r\nafter letter-writing, in discussion with Manning, Hope, and others on\r\nthe Gorham case and its probable consequences. This slip of memory in\r\nthe cardinal is trivial and not worth mentioning, but perhaps it tends\r\nto impair another vivid scene described on the same authority; how\r\nthirteen of them met at Mr. Gladstone's house, agreed to a declaration\r\nagainst the judgment, and proceeded to sign; how Mr. Gladstone, standing\r\nwith his back to the fire, began to demur; and when pressed by Manning\r\nto sign, asked him in a low voice whether he thought that as a privy\r\ncouncillor he ought to sign such a protest; and finally how Manning,\r\nknowing the pertinacity of his character, turned and said: We will not\r\npress him further.[233] This graphic relation looks as if Mr. Gladstone\r\nwere leaving his friends in the lurch. None of them ever said so, none\r\nof them made any signs of thinking so. There is no evidence that Mr.\r\nGladstone ever agreed to the resolution at all, and there is even\r\nevidence that points presumptively the other way: that he was taking a\r\nline of his own, and arguing tenaciously against all the rest for\r\ndelay.[234] Mr. Gladstone was often enough in a hurry himself, but there\r\nnever was a man in this world more resolute against being hurried by\r\nother people.[235]\r\n\r\n                  EXCITING EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT\r\n\r\nWe need not, however, argue probabilities. Mr. Gladstone no sooner saw\r\nthe story than he pronounced it fiction. In a letter to the writer of\r\nthe book on Cardinal Manning (Jan. 14, 1896) he says:--\r\n\r\n     I read with surprise Manning's statement (made first after 35\r\n     years) that I would not sign the declaration of 1850 because I 'was\r\n     a privy councillor.' I should not have been more surprised had he\r\n     written that I told him I could not sign because my name began with\r\n     G. I had done stronger things than that when I was not only privy\r\n     councillor but official servant of the crown, nay, I believe\r\n     cabinet minister. The declaration was liable to _many_ interior\r\n     objections. Seven out of the thirteen who signed did so without (I\r\n     believe) any kind of sequel. I wish you to know that I entirely\r\n     disavow and disclaim Manning's statement as it _stands_. And here I\r\n     have to ask you to insert two lines in your second or next edition;\r\n     with the simple statement that I prepared and published with\r\n     promptitude an elaborate argument to show that the judicial\r\n     committee was historically unconstitutional, as an organ for the\r\n     decision of ecclesiastical questions. This declaration was\r\n     entitled, I think, 'A Letter to the Bishop of London on the\r\n     Ecclesiastical Supremacy.' If I recollect right, while it dealt\r\n     little with theology, it was a more pregnant production than the\r\n     declaration, and it went much nearer the mark. It has been\r\n     repeatedly published, and is still on sale at Murray's. I am glad\r\n     to see that Sidney Herbert (a _gentleman_ if ever there was one)\r\n     also declined to sign. It seems to me _now_, that there is\r\n     something almost ludicrous in the propounding of such a congeries\r\n     of statements by such persons as we were; not the more, but\r\n     certainly not the less, because of being privy councillors.\r\n\r\n     It was a terrible time; aggravated for me by heavy cares and\r\n     responsibilities of a nature quite extraneous: and far beyond all\r\n     others by the illness and death of a much-loved child, with great\r\n     anxieties about another. My recollections of the conversations\r\n     before the declaration are little but a mass of confusion and\r\n     bewilderment. I stand only upon what I _did_. No one of us, I\r\n     think, understood the actual position, not even our lawyers, until\r\n     Baron Alderson printed an excellent statement on the points\r\n     raised.[236]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nFor long the new situation filled his mind. 'The case of the church of\r\nEngland at this moment,' he wrote to Lord Lyttelton, 'is a very dismal\r\none, and almost leaves men to choose between a broken heart and no heart\r\nat all. But at present it is all dark or only twilight which rests upon\r\nour future.' He busily set down thoughts upon the supremacy. He studied\r\nCawdry's case, and he mastered Lord Coke's view of the law. He feels\r\nbetter pleased with the Reformation in regard to the supremacy; but also\r\nmuch more sensible of the drifting of the church since, away from the\r\nrange of her constitutional securities; and more than ever convinced how\r\nthoroughly false is the present position. As to himself and his own work\r\nin life, in reply I suppose to something urged by Manning, he says\r\n(April 29, 1850), 'I have two characters to fulfil--that of a lay\r\nmember of the church, and that of a member of a sort of wreck of a\r\npolitical party. I must not break my understood compact with the last,\r\nand forswear my profession, unless and until the necessity has arisen.\r\nThat necessity will plainly have arisen for me when it shall have become\r\nevident that justice cannot, _i.e._, will not, be done by the state to\r\nthe church.' With boundless exaltation of spirit he expatiated on the\r\narduous and noble task which it was now laid upon the children of the\r\nchurch of England amid trouble, suspense, and it might be even agony to\r\nperform. 'Fully believing that the death of the church of England is\r\namong the alternative issues of the Gorham case,' he wrote to a clerical\r\nfriend (April 9), 'I yet also believe that all Christendom and all its\r\nhistory have rarely afforded a nobler opportunity of doing battle for\r\nthe faith in the church than that now offered to English churchmen. That\r\nopportunity is a prize far beyond any with which the days of her\r\nprosperity, in any period, can have been adorned.' He does not think\r\n(June 1, 1850), that a loftier work was ever committed to men. Such vast\r\ninterests were at stake, such unbounded prospects open before them. What\r\nthey wanted was the divine art to draw from present terrible calamities\r\nand appalling future prospects the conquering secret to rise through the\r\nstruggle into something better than historical anglicanism, which\r\nessentially depended on conditions that have passed away. 'In my own\r\ncase,' he says to Manning a little later, 'there is work ready to my\r\nhand and much more than enough for its weakness, a great mercy and\r\ncomfort. But I think I know what my course would be, were there not. It\r\nwould be to set to work upon the holy task or clearing, opening, and\r\nestablishing positive truth in the church of England, which is an office\r\ndoubly blessed, inasmuch as it is both the business of truth, and the\r\nlaying of firm foundations for future union in Christendom.' If this\r\nvision of a dream had ever come to pass, perhaps Europe might have seen\r\nthe mightiest Christian doctor since Bossuet; and just as Bossuet's\r\nstruggle was called the grandest spectacle of the seventeenth century,\r\nso to many eyes this might have appeared the greatest of the\r\nnineteenth. Mr. Gladstone did not see, in truth he never saw, any more\r\nthan Bossuet saw in his age, that the Time-Spirit was shifting the\r\nfoundations of the controversy. However that may be, the interesting\r\nthing for us in the history of his life is the characteristic blaze of\r\nbattle that this case now kindled in his breast.\r\n\r\n                   VIEW OF THE CRISIS IN THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his return from Germany in the autumn of 1845, one of his\r\nletters to Mrs. Gladstone reveals the pressing intensity of his\r\nconviction, deepened by his intercourse with the grave and pious circles\r\nat Munich and at Stuttgart, of the supreme interest of spiritual\r\nthings:--\r\n\r\n     In my wanderings my thoughts too have had time to travel; and I\r\n     have had much conversation upon church matters first at Munich and\r\n     since coming here with Mrs. Craven and some connections of hers\r\n     staying with her, who are Roman catholics of a high school. All\r\n     that I can see and learn induces me more and more to feel what a\r\n     crisis for religion at large is this period of the world's\r\n     history--how the power of religion and its permanence are bound up\r\n     with the church--how inestimably precious would be the church's\r\n     unity, inestimably precious on the one hand, and on the other to\r\n     human eyes immeasurably remote--lastly how loud, how solemn is the\r\n     call upon all those who hear and who _can_ obey it, to labour more\r\n     and more in the spirit of these principles, to give themselves, if\r\n     it may be, clearly and wholly to that work. It is dangerous to put\r\n     indefinite thoughts, instincts, longings, into language which is\r\n     necessarily determinate. I cannot trace the line of my own future\r\n     life, but I hope and pray it may not always be where it is....\r\n     Ireland, Ireland! that cloud in the west, that coming storm, the\r\n     minister of God's retribution upon cruel and inveterate and but\r\n     half-atoned injustice! Ireland forces upon us those great social\r\n     and great religious questions--God grant that we may have courage\r\n     to look them in the face, and to work through them. Were they over,\r\n     were the path of the church clear before her, as a body able to\r\n     take her trial before God and the world upon the performance of her\r\n     work as His organ for the recovery of our country--how joyfully\r\n     would I retire from the barren, exhausting strife of merely\r\n     political contention. I do not think that you would be very\r\n     sorrowful? As to ambition in its ordinary sense, we are spared the\r\n     chief part of its temptations. If it has a valuable reward upon\r\n     earth over and above a good name, it is when a man is enabled to\r\n     bequeath to his children a high place in the social system of his\r\n     country. That cannot be our case. The days are gone by when such a\r\n     thing might have been possible. To leave to Willy a title with its\r\n     burdens and restraints and disqualifications, but without the\r\n     material substratum of wealth, and the duties and means of good, as\r\n     well as the general power attending it, would not I think be acting\r\n     for him in a wise and loving spirit--assuming, which may be a vain\r\n     assumption, that the alternative could ever be before us.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in Scotland, a country in which Mr. Gladstone passed so\r\nmuch time and had such lively interests, the members of his own\r\nepiscopal church were dissenters, was well fitted to hasten the progress\r\nof his mind in the liberal direction. Certain it is that in a\r\nstrongly-written letter to a Scotch bishop at the end of 1851, Mr.\r\nGladstone boldly enlarged upon the doctrine of religious freedom, with a\r\ndirectness that kindled both alarm and indignation among some of his\r\nwarmest friends.[237] Away, he cried, with the servile doctrine that\r\nreligion cannot live but by the aid of parliaments. When the state has\r\nceased to bear a definite and full religious character, it is our\r\ninterest and our duty alike to maintain a full religious freedom. It is\r\nthis plenary religious freedom that brings out in full vigour the\r\ninternal energies of each communion. Of all civil calamities the\r\ngreatest is the mutilation, under the seal of civil authority, of the\r\nChristian religion itself. One fine passage in this letter denotes an\r\nadvance in his political temper, as remarkable as the power of the\r\nlanguage in which it finds expression:--\r\n\r\n     It is a great and noble secret, that of constitutional freedom,\r\n     which has given to us the largest liberties, with the steadiest\r\n     throne and the most vigorous executive in Christendom. I confess to\r\n     my strong faith in the virtue of this principle. I have lived now\r\n     for many years in the midst of the hottest and noisiest of its\r\n     workshops, and have seen that amidst the clatter and the din a\r\n     ceaseless labour is going on; stubborn matter is reduced to\r\n     obedience, and the brute powers of society like the fire, air,\r\n     water, and mineral of nature are, with clamour indeed but also with\r\n     might, educated and shaped into the most refined and regular forms\r\n     of usefulness for man. I am deeply convinced that among us all\r\n     systems, whether religious or political, which rest on a principle\r\n     of absolutism, must of necessity be, not indeed tyrannical, but\r\n     feeble and ineffective systems; and that methodically to enlist the\r\n     members of a community, with due regard to their several\r\n     capacities, in the performance of its public duties, is the way to\r\n     make that community powerful and healthful, to give a firm seat to\r\n     its rulers, and to engender a warm and intelligent devotion in\r\n     those beneath their sway.[238]\r\n\r\n                       FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\nThese were the golden trumpet-notes of a new time. When they readied the\r\nears of old Dr. Routh, as he sat in wig and cassock among his books and\r\nmanuscripts at Magdalen, revolving nearly a hundred years of mortal\r\nlife, he exclaimed that he had heard enough to be quite sure that no man\r\nholding such opinions as these could ever be a proper member for the\r\nuniversity of Oxford. A few months later, it was seen how the learned\r\nman found several hundreds of unlearned to agree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThis chapter naturally closes with what was to Mr. Gladstone one of the\r\ndire catastrophies of his life. With growing dismay he had seen Manning\r\ndrawing steadily towards the edge of the cataract. When he took the\r\nominous step of quitting his charge at Lavington, Mr. Gladstone wrote to\r\nhim from Naples (January 26, 1851): 'Without description from you, I can\r\ntoo well comprehend what you have suffered.... Such griefs ought to be\r\nsacred to all men, they must be sacred to me, even did they not touch me\r\nsharply with a reflected sorrow. You can do nothing that does not reach\r\nme, considering how long you have been a large part both of my actual\r\nlife and of my hopes and reckonings. Should you do the act which I pray\r\nGod with my whole soul you may not do, it will not break, however it may\r\nimpair or strain, the bonds between us.' 'If you go over,' he says, in\r\nanother letter of the same month, 'I should earnestly pray that you\r\nmight not be as others who have gone before you, but might carry with\r\nyou a larger heart and mind, able to raise and keep you above that\r\nslavery to a system, that exaggeration of its forms, that disposition to\r\nrivet every shackle tighter and to stretch every breach wider, which\r\nmakes me mournfully feel that the men who have gone from the church of\r\nEngland after being reared in her and by her, are far more keen, and I\r\nmust add, far more cruel adversaries to her, than were the mass of those\r\nwhom they joined.'\r\n\r\nIn the case of Hope there had been for some considerable time a\r\nlingering sense of change. 'My affection for him, during these later\r\nyears before his change, was I may almost say intense: there was hardly\r\nanything I think which he could have asked me to do, and which I would\r\nnot have done. But as I saw more and more through the dim light what was\r\nto happen, it became more and more like the affection felt for one\r\ndeparted.' Hope, he says, was not one of those shallow souls who think\r\nthat such a relation can continue after its daily bread has been taken\r\naway. At the end of March he enters in his diary: 'Wrote a paper on\r\nManning's question and gave it him. He smote me to the ground by\r\nannouncing with suppressed emotion that he is now upon the _brink_, and\r\nHope too. Such terrible blows not only overset and oppress but, I fear,\r\ndemoralise me.' On the same day in April 1851, Manning and Hope were\r\nreceived together into the Roman church. Political separations, though\r\nthese too have their pangs, must have seemed to Mr. Gladstone trivial\r\nindeed, after the tragic severance of such a fellowship as this had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n                     MANNING AND HOPE GO OVER\r\n\r\n'They were my two props,' he wrote in his diary the next day. 'Their\r\ngoing may be to me a sign that my work is gone with them.... One\r\nblessing I have: total freedom from doubts. These dismal events have\r\nsmitten, but not shaken.' The day after that, he made a codicil to his\r\nwill striking out Hope as executor, and substituting Northcote.\r\nFriendship did not die, but only lived 'as it lives between those who\r\ninhabit separate worlds.' Communication was not severed; social\r\nintercourse was not avoided; and both on occasions in life, the passing\r\nby of which, as Hope-Scott said, would be a loss to friendship, and on\r\nsmaller opportunities, they corresponded in terms of the old affection.\r\n_Quis desiderio_ is Mr. Gladstone's docket on one of Hope's letters, and\r\nin another (1858) Hope communicates in words of tender feeling the loss\r\nof his wife, and the consolatory teachings of the faith that she, like\r\nhimself, had embraced; and he recalls to Mr. Gladstone that the root of\r\ntheir friendship which struck the deepest was fed by a common interest\r\nin religion.[239]\r\n\r\nIn Manning's case the wound cut deeper, and for many years the\r\nestrangement was complete.[240] To Wilberforce, the archdeacon, Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote (April 11, 1851):--\r\n\r\n     I do indeed feel the loss of Manning, if and as far as I am capable\r\n     of feeling anything. It comes to me cumulated, and doubled, with\r\n     that of James Hope. Nothing like it can ever happen to me again.\r\n     Arrived now at middle life, I never _can_ form I suppose with any\r\n     other two men the habits of communication, counsel, and dependence,\r\n     in which I have now for from fifteen to eighteen years lived with\r\n     them both.... My intellect does deliberately reject the grounds on\r\n     which Manning has proceeded. Indeed they are such as go far to\r\n     destroy my confidence, which was once and far too long at the\r\n     highest point, in the healthiness and soundness of his. To show\r\n     that at any rate this is not from the mere change he has made, I\r\n     may add, that my conversations with Hope have not left any\r\n     corresponding impression upon my mind with regard to him.\r\n\r\nA wider breach was this same year made in his inmost circle. In April of\r\nthe year before a little daughter, between four and five years old, had\r\ndied, and was buried at Fasque. The illness was long and painful, and\r\nMr. Gladstone bore his part in the nursing and watching. He was tenderly\r\nfond of his little children, and the sorrow had a peculiar bitterness.\r\nIt was the first time that death entered his married home.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Fasque in the autumn he found that his father had\r\ntaken 'a decided step, nay a stride, in old age'; not having lost any of\r\nhis interest in politics, but grown quite mild. The old man was nearing\r\nhis eighty-seventh year. 'The very wreck of his powerful and simple\r\nnature is full of grandeur.... Mischief is at work upon his brain--that\r\nindefatigable brain which has had to stand all the wear and pressure of\r\nhis long life.' In the spring of 1851 he finds him 'very like a spent\r\ncannon-ball, with a great and sometimes almost frightful energy\r\nremaining in him: though weak in comparison with what he was, he hits a\r\nvery hard knock to those who come across him.' When December came, the\r\nveteran was taken seriously ill, and the hope disappeared of seeing him\r\neven reach his eighty-seventh birthday (Dec. 11). On the 7th he died. As\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote to Phillimore, 'though with little left either of\r\nsight or hearing, and only able to walk from one room to another or to\r\nhis brougham for a short drive, though his memory was gone, his hold\r\nupon language even for common purposes imperfect, the reasoning power\r\nmuch decayed, and even his perception of personality rather indistinct,\r\nyet so much remained about him as one of the most manful, energetic,\r\naffectionate, and simple-hearted among human beings, that he still\r\nfilled a great space to the eye, mind, and heart, and a great space is\r\naccordingly left void by his withdrawal.' 'The death of my father,' Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to his brother John, 'is the loss of a great object of\r\nlove, and it is the shattering of a great bond of union. Among few\r\nfamilies of five persons will be found differences of character and\r\nopinion to the same aggregate amount as among us. We cannot shut our\r\neyes to this fact; by opening them, I think we may the better strive to\r\nprevent such differences from begetting estrangement.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[232] See above, p. 167.\r\n\r\n[233] Purcell, _Manning_, i. pp. 528-33.\r\n\r\n[234] See J. B. Hope's letter (undated) in Purcell, i. p. 530.\r\n\r\n[235] On March 13, Hope writes to Mr. Gladstone from 14 Curzon\r\nStreet:--'Keble and Pusey have been with me to-day, and the latter has\r\nsuggested some alterations in the resolutions; I have taken upon me to\r\npropose a meeting at your house at 1/4 before 10 to-morrow morning. If\r\nyou cannot _or do not wish_ to be present, I do not doubt you will at\r\nany rate allow me the use of your rooms.' The meeting seems to have\r\ntaken place, for the entry on March 14 in Mr. Gladstone's diary is\r\nthis:--'Hope, Badeley, Talbot, Cavendish, Denison, Dr. Pusey, Keble,\r\nBennett, here from 93/4 to 12 on the draft of the resolutions. Badeley\r\nagain in the evening. On the whole I resolved to try some immediate\r\neffort.' This would appear to be the last meeting, and Manning is not\r\nnamed as present. On the 18th:--'Drs. Mill, Pusey, etc., met here in the\r\nevening, I was not with them.' On the same day Mr. Gladstone had written\r\nto the Rev. W. Maskell, 'As respects myself, I do not intend to pursue\r\nthe consideration of them with those who meet to-night, first, because\r\nthe pressure of other business has become very heavy upon me, and\r\nsecondly and mainly, because I do not consider that the time for any\r\nenunciation of a character pointing to ultimate issues will have arrived\r\nuntil the Gorham judgment shall have taken effect.' No later meeting is\r\never mentioned.\r\n\r\n[236] Purcell professed to rectify the matter in the fourth edition, i.\r\np. 536, but the reader is nowhere told that Mr. Gladstone disavowed the\r\noriginal story.\r\n\r\n[237] _Letter to the Right Rev. William Skinner, Bishop of Aberdeen and\r\nPrimus, on the functions of laymen in the Church_, reprinted in\r\n_Gleanings_, vi.

Parker,\r\n1852.\r\n\r\n[238] _Gleanings_, vi. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[239] In 1868 Mr. Gladstone urged him to produce an abridged version of\r\nLockhart's _Life of Scott_. Then Hope found that his father-in-law's own\r\nabridgment was unknown; and (1871) asks Mr. Gladstone's leave to\r\ndedicate a reprint of it to him as 'one among those who think that Scott\r\nstill deserves to be remembered, not as an author only, but as a noble\r\nand vigorous man.'\r\n\r\n[240] From 1853 to 1861 they did not correspond nor did they even meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                                NAPLES\r\n\r\n                             (_1850-1851_)\r\n\r\n     It would be amusing, if the misfortunes of mankind ever could be\r\n     so, to hear the pretensions of the government here [Naples] to\r\n     mildness and clemency, because it does not put men to death, and\r\n     confines itself to leaving six or seven thousand state prisoners to\r\n     perish in dungeons. I am ready to believe that the king of Naples\r\n     is naturally mild and kindly, but he is afraid, and the worst of\r\n     all tyrannies is the tyranny of cowards.--TOCQUEVILLE [1850].\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1850, with the object of benefiting the eyesight of one\r\nof their daughters, the Gladstones made a journey to southern Italy, and\r\nan eventful journey it proved. For Italy it was, that now first drew Mr.\r\nGladstone by the native ardour of his humanity, unconsciously and\r\ninvoluntarily, into that great European stream of liberalism which was\r\ndestined to carry him so far. Two deep principles, sentiments,\r\naspirations, forces, call them what we will, awoke the huge uprisings\r\nthat shook Europe in 1848--the principle of Liberty, the sentiment of\r\nNationality. Mr. Gladstone, slowly and almost blindly heaving off his\r\nshoulders the weight of old conservative tradition, did not at first go\r\nbeyond liberty, with all that ordered liberty conveys. Nationality\r\npenetrated later, and then indeed it penetrated to the heart's core. He\r\nwent to Naples with no purposes of political propagandism, and his\r\nprepossessions were at that time pretty strongly in favour of\r\nestablished governments, either at Naples or anywhere else. The case had\r\ndoubtless been opened to him by Panizzi--a man as Mr. Gladstone\r\ndescribed him, 'of warm, large, and free nature, an accomplished man of\r\nletters, and a victim of political persecution, who came to this country\r\na nearly starving refugee.' But Panizzi had certainly made no great\r\nrevolutionist of him. His opinions, as he told Lord Aberdeen, were the\r\ninvoluntary and unexpected result of his sojourn.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to do with the subterranean forces at work in the kingdom\r\nof the Two Sicilies, in the States of the Church, and in truth all over\r\nthe Peninsula. The protracted struggle that had begun after the\r\nestablishment of Austrian domination in the Peninsula in 1815, and was\r\nat last to end in the construction of an Italian kingdom--the most\r\nwonderful political transformation of the century--seemed after the\r\nfatal crisis of Novara (1849) further than ever from a close. Now was\r\nthe morrow of the vast failures and disenchantments of 1848. Jesuits and\r\nabsolutists were once more masters, and reaction again alternated with\r\nconspiracy, risings, desperate carbonari plots. Mazzini, four years\r\nolder than Mr. Gladstone, and Cavour, a year his junior, were directing\r\nin widely different ways, the one the revolutionary movement of Young\r\nItaly, the other the constitutional movement of the Italian\r\nResurrection. The scene presented brutal repression on the one hand; on\r\nthe other a chaos of republicans and monarchists, unitarians and\r\nfederalists, frenzied idealists and sedate economists, wild ultras and\r\nmen of the sober middle course. In the midst was the pope, the august\r\nshadow, not long before the centre, now once again the foe, of his\r\ncountrymen's aspirations after freedom and a purer glimpse of the lights\r\nof the sun. The evolution of this extraordinary historic drama, to which\r\npassion, genius, hope, contrivance, stratagem, and force contributed\r\nalike the highest and the lowest elements in human nature and the growth\r\nof states, was to be one of the most sincere of Mr. Gladstone's\r\ninterests for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n                        SPECTACLE OF MISRULE\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, he was at first and he long remained untouched by the\r\nidea of Italian unity and Italy a nation. He met some thirty or more\r\nItalian gentlemen in society at Naples, of whom seven or eight only were\r\nin any sense liberals, and not one of them a republican. It was now that\r\nhe made the acquaintance of Lacaita, afterwards so valued a friend of\r\nhis, and so well known in many circles in England for his geniality,\r\ncultivation, and enlightenment. He was the legal adviser to the British\r\nembassy; he met Mr. Gladstone constantly; they talked politics and\r\nliterature day and night, 'under the acacias and palms, between the\r\nfountains and statues of the Villa Reale, looking now to the sea, now to\r\nthe world of fashion in the Corso.' Here Lacaita first opened the\r\ntraveller's eyes to the condition of things, though he was able to say\r\nwith literal truth that not a single statement of fact was made upon\r\nLacaita's credit. Mr. Gladstone saw Bourbon absolutism no longer in the\r\ndecorous hues of conventional diplomacy, but as the black and execrable\r\nthing it really was,--'the negation of God erected into a system of\r\ngovernment.' Sitting in court for long hours during the trial of Poerio,\r\nhe listened with as much patience as he could command to the principal\r\ncrown witness, giving such evidence that the tenth part of what he heard\r\nshould not only have ended the case, but secured condign punishment for\r\nperjury--evidence that a prostitute court found good enough to justify\r\nthe infliction on Poerio, not long before a minister of the crown, of\r\nthe dreadful penalty of four-and-twenty years in irons. Mr. Gladstone\r\naccurately informed himself of the condition of those who for unproved\r\npolitical offences were in thousands undergoing degrading and murderous\r\npenalties. He contrived to visit some of the Neapolitan prisons, another\r\nname for the extreme of filth and horror; he saw political prisoners\r\n(and political prisoners included a large percentage of the liberal\r\nopposition) chained two and two in double irons to common felons; he\r\nconversed with Poerio himself in the bagno of Nisida chained in this\r\nway; he watched sick prisoners, men almost with death in their faces,\r\ntoiling upstairs to see the doctors, because the lower regions were too\r\nfoul and loathsome to allow it to be expected that professional men\r\nwould enter. Even these inhuman and revolting scenes stirred him less,\r\nas it was right they should, than the corruptions of the tribunals, the\r\nvindictive treatment for long periods of time of uncondemned and untried\r\nmen, and all the other proceedings of the government, 'desolating entire\r\nclasses upon which the life and growth of the nation depend,\r\nundermining the foundation of all civil rule.' It was this violation of\r\nall law, and of the constitution to which King Ferdinand had solemnly\r\nsworn fidelity only a year or two before, that outraged him more than\r\neven rigorous sentences and barbarous prison practice. 'Even on the\r\nseverity of these sentences,' he wrote, 'I would not endeavour to fix\r\nattention so much as to draw it off from the great fact of illegality,\r\nwhich seems to me to be the foundation of the Neapolitan system;\r\nillegality, the fountain-head of cruelty and baseness and every other\r\nvice; illegality which gives a bad conscience, creates fears; those\r\nfears lead to tyranny, that tyranny begets resentment, that resentment\r\ncreates true causes of fear where they were not before; and thus fear is\r\nquickened and enhanced, the original vice multiplies itself with fearful\r\nspeed, and the old crime engenders a necessity for new.'[241]\r\n\r\nPoerio apprehended that his own case had been made worse by the\r\nintervention of Mr. Temple, the British minister and brother of Lord\r\nPalmerston; not in the least as blaming him or considering it officious.\r\nHe adopted the motto, 'to suffer is to do,' '_il patire e anche\r\noperare_.' For himself he was not only willing--he rejoiced--to play the\r\nmartyr's part.\r\n\r\n     I was particularly desirous, wrote Mr. Gladstone in a private\r\n     memorandum, to have Poerio's opinion on the expediency of making\r\n     some effort in England to draw general attention to these horrors,\r\n     and dissociate the conservative party from all suppositions of\r\n     winking at them; because I had had from a sensible man one strong\r\n     opinion against such a course. I said to him that in my view only\r\n     two models could be thought of,--the first, amicable remonstrance\r\n     through the cabinets, the second public notoriety and shame. That\r\n     had Lord Aberdeen been in power the first might have been\r\n     practicable, but that with Lord Palmerston it would not, because of\r\n     his position relatively to the other cabinets (Yes, he said, Lord\r\n     Palmerston was _isolato_), not because he would be wanting in the\r\n     will. Matters standing thus, I saw no way open but that of\r\n     exposure; and might that possibly exasperate the Neapolitan\r\n     government, and increase their severity? His reply was, 'As to us,\r\n     never mind; we can hardly be worse than we are. But think of our\r\n     country, for which we are most willing to be sacrificed. Exposure\r\n     will do it good. The present government of Naples rely on the\r\n     English conservative party. Consequently we were all in horror when\r\n     Lord Stanley last year carried his motion in the House of Lords.\r\n     Let there be a voice from that party showing that whatever\r\n     government be in power in England, no support will be given to such\r\n     proceedings as these. It will do much to break them down. It will\r\n     also strengthen the hands of a better and less obdurate class about\r\n     the court. Even there all are not alike. I know it from\r\n     observation. These ministers are the extremest of extremes. There\r\n     are others who would willingly see more moderate means adopted.' On\r\n     such grounds as these (I do not quote words) he strongly\r\n     recommended me to _act_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\n                             RETURN TO LONDON\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone reached London on February 26. Phillimore met him at the\r\nstation with Lord Stanley's letter, of which we shall hear in the next\r\nchapter, pressing him to enter the government. 'I was never more\r\nstruck,' says Phillimore, 'by the earnestness and simplicity of his\r\ncharacter. He could speak of nothing so readily as the horrors of the\r\nNeapolitan government, of which I verily believe he thought nearly as\r\nmuch as the prospect of his own accession to one of the highest offices\r\nof state.' He probably thought not only nearly as much, but infinitely\r\nmore of those 'scenes fitter for hell than earth,' now many hundred\r\nmiles away, but still vividly burning in the haunted chambers of his\r\nwrath and pity. After rapidly despatching the proposal to join the new\r\ncabinet, after making the best he could of the poignant anxieties that\r\nwere stirred in him by the unmistakeable signs of the approaching\r\nsecession of Hope and Manning, he sought Lord Aberdeen (March 4), and\r\n'found him as always, satisfactory; kind, just, moderate, humane' (to\r\nMrs. Gladstone, March 4). He had come to London with the intention of\r\nobtaining, if possible, Aberdeen's intervention, in preference to any\r\nother mode of proceeding,[242] and they agreed that private\r\nrepresentation and remonstrance should be tried in the first instance,\r\nas less likely than public action by Mr. Gladstone in parliament, to\r\nrouse international jealousy abroad, or to turn the odious tragedy into\r\nthe narrow channels of party at home. Mr. Gladstone, at Lord Aberdeen's\r\ndesire, was to submit a statement of the case for his consideration and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n                      POSITION OF LORD ABERDEEN\r\n\r\nThis statement, the first memorable Letter to Lord Aberdeen, was ready\r\nat the beginning of April. The old minister gave it 'mature\r\nconsideration' for the best part of a month. His antecedents made him\r\ncautious. Mr. Gladstone, ten years later, admitted that Lord Aberdeen's\r\nviews of Italy did not harmonise with what was his general mode of\r\nestimating human action and the world's affairs, and there was a reason\r\nfor this in his past career. In very early youth he had been called upon\r\nto deal with the gigantic questions that laid their mighty weight upon\r\nEuropean statesmen at the fall of Napoleon; the natural effect of this\r\nclose contact with the vast and formidable problems of 1814-5 was to\r\nmake him regard the state-system then founded as a structure on which\r\nonly reckless or criminal unwisdom would dare to lay a finger. The\r\nfierce storms of 1848 were not calculated to loosen this fixed idea, or\r\nto dispose him to any new views of either the relations of Austria to\r\nItaly, or of the uncounted mischiefs to the Peninsula of which those\r\nrelations were the nourishing and maintaining cause. In a debate in the\r\nLords two years before (July 20, 1849), Lord Aberdeen had sharply\r\ncriticised the British government of the day for doing the very thing\r\nofficially, which Mr. Gladstone was now bringing moral compulsion on him\r\nto attempt unofficially. Lord Palmerston had called attention at Vienna\r\nto the crying evils of the government of Naples, and had boldly said\r\nthat it was little wonder if men groaning for long years under such\r\ngrievances and seeing no hope of redress, should take up any scheme,\r\nhowever wild, that held out any chance of relief. This and other\r\nproceedings indicating unfriendliness to the King of Naples and a veiled\r\nsympathy with rebellion shocked Aberdeen as much as Lamartine's\r\ntrenchant saying that the treaties of Vienna were effete. In attacking\r\nPalmerston's foreign policy again in 1850, he protested that we had\r\ndeeply injured Austria and had represented her operations in Italy in a\r\ncompletely false light. In his speech in the Pacifico debate, he had\r\nreferred to the Neapolitan government without approval but in guarded\r\nphrases, and had urged as against Lord Palmerston that the less they\r\nadmired Neapolitan institutions and usages, the more careful ought they\r\nto be not to impair the application of the sacred principles that govern\r\nand harmonise the intercourse between states, from which you never can\r\ndepart without producing mischiefs a thousand fold greater than any\r\npromised advantage. Aberdeen was too upright and deeply humane a man to\r\nresist the dreadful evidence that was now forced upon him. Still that\r\nevidence plainly shook down his own case of a few months earlier, and\r\nthis cannot have been pleasing. He felt the truth and the enormity of\r\nthe indictment laid before him; he saw the prejudice that would\r\ninevitably be done to conservatism both at home and on the European\r\ncontinent, by the publication of such an indictment from the lips of\r\nsuch a pleader; and he perceived from Mr. Gladstone's demeanour that the\r\ndecorous plausibilities of diplomacy would no more hold him back from\r\nresolute exposure, than they would put out the fires of Vesuvius or\r\nEtna.\r\n\r\nOn May 2 Lord Aberdeen wrote to Schwarzenberg at Vienna, saying that for\r\nforty years he had been connected with the Austrian government, and\r\ntaken a warm interest in the fortunes of the empire; that Mr. Gladstone,\r\none of the most distinguished members of the cabinet of Peel, had been\r\nso shocked by what he saw at Naples, that he was resolved to make some\r\npublic appeal; that to avoid the pain and scandal of a conservative\r\nstatesman taking such a course, would not his highness use his powerful\r\ninfluence to get done at Naples all that could reasonably be desired?\r\nThe Austrian minister replied several weeks after (June 30). If he had\r\nbeen invited, he said, officially to interfere he would have declined;\r\nas it was, he would bring Mr. Gladstone's statements to the notice of\r\nhis Sicilian majesty. Meanwhile, at great length, he reminded Lord\r\nAberdeen that a political offender may be the worst of all offenders,\r\nand argued that the rigour exercised by England herself in the Ionian\r\nIslands, in Ceylon, in respect of Irishmen, and in the recent case of\r\nErnest Jones, showed how careful she should be in taking up abroad the\r\ncause of bad men posing as martyrs in the holy cause of liberty.\r\n\r\nDuring all these weeks, while Aberdeen was maturely considering, and\r\nwhile Prince Schwarzenberg was making his secretaries hunt up\r\nrecriminatory cases against England, Mr. Gladstone was growing\r\nimpatient. Lord Aberdeen begged him to give the Austrian minister a\r\nlittle more time. It was nearly four months since Mr. Gladstone landed\r\nat Dover, and every day he thought of Poerio, Settembrini, and the rest,\r\nwearing their double chains, subsisting on their foul soup, degraded by\r\nforced companionship with criminals, cut off from the light of heaven,\r\nand festering in their dungeons. The facts that escaped from him in\r\nprivate conversation seemed to him--so he tells Lacaita--to spread like\r\nwildfire from man to man, exciting the liveliest interest, and extending\r\nto the highest persons in the land. He waited a fortnight more, then at\r\nthe beginning of July he launched his thunderbolt, publishing his Letter\r\nto Lord Aberdeen, followed by a second explanation and enlargement a\r\nfortnight later.[243] He did not obtain formal leave from Lord Aberdeen\r\nfor the publication, but from their conversation took it for granted.\r\n\r\n                     NEAPOLITAN LETTERS PUBLISHED\r\n\r\nThe sensation was profound, and not in England only. The Letters were\r\ntranslated into various tongues and had a large circulation. The Society\r\nof the Friends of Italy in London, the disciples of Mazzini (and a\r\nhigh-hearted band they were), besought him to become a member. Exiles\r\nwrote him letters of gratitude and hope, with all the moving accent of\r\nrevolutionary illusion. Italian women composed fervid odes in fire and\r\ntears to the '_generoso britanno_,' the '_magnanimo cor_,' the\r\n'_difensore d'un popolo gemente_.' The press in this country took the\r\nmatter up with the warmth that might have been expected. The character\r\nand the politics of the accuser added invincible force to his\r\naccusations, and for the first time in his life Mr. Gladstone found\r\nhimself vehemently applauded in liberal prints. Even the contemporary\r\nexcitement of English public feeling against the Roman catholic church\r\nfed the flame. It was pointed out that the King of Naples was the bosom\r\nfriend of the pope, and that the infernal system described by Mr.\r\nGladstone was that which the Roman clergy regarded as normal and\r\ncomplete.[244] Mr. Gladstone had denounced as one of the most detestable\r\nbooks he ever read a certain catechism used in the Neapolitan schools.\r\nWhy then, cried the _Times_, does he omit all comment on the church\r\nwhich is the main and direct agent in this atrocious instruction? The\r\nclergy had either basely accepted from the government doctrines that\r\nthey were bound to abhor, or else these doctrines were their own. And so\r\nthings glided easily round to Dr. Cullen and the Irish education\r\nquestion. This line was none the less natural from the fact that the\r\neditor of the _Univers_, the chief catholic organ in France, made\r\nhimself the foremost champion of the Neapolitan policy. The Letters\r\ndelighted the Paris Reds. They regarded their own epithets as insipid by\r\ncomparison with the ferocious adjectives of the English conservative. On\r\nthe other hand, an English gentleman was blackballed at one of the\r\nfashionable clubs in Paris for no better reason than that he bore the\r\nname of Gladstone. For European conservatives read the letters with\r\ndisgust and apprehension. People like Madame de Lieven pronounced Mr.\r\nGladstone the dupe of men less honest than himself, and declared that he\r\nhad injured the good cause and discredited his own fame, besides doing\r\nLord Aberdeen the wrong of setting his name at the head of a detestable\r\nlibel. The illustrious Guizot wrote Mr. Gladstone a long letter\r\nexpressing, with much courtesy and kindness, his regret at the\r\npublication. Nothing is left in Italy, said Guizot, between the terrors\r\nof governments attacked in their very existence and the fury of the\r\nbeaten revolutionists with hopes more alert than ever for destruction\r\nand chaos. The King of Naples on one side, Mazzini on the other; such,\r\nsaid Guizot, is Italy. Between the King of Naples and Mazzini, he for\r\none did not hesitate. This was Mr. Gladstone's first contact with the\r\nEuropean party of order in the middle of the century. Guizot was a great\r\nman, but '48 had perverted his generalising intellect, and everywhere\r\nhis jaundiced vision perceived in progress a struggle for life and death\r\nwith 'the revolutionary spirit, blind, chimerical, insatiate,\r\nimpracticable.' He avowed his own failure when he was at the head of the\r\nFrench government, to induce the rulers of Italy to make reforms; and\r\nnow the answer of Schwarzenberg to Lord Aberdeen, as well as the\r\nofficial communications from Naples, showed that like Guizot's French\r\npolicy the Austrian remedy was moonshine.\r\n\r\nPerhaps discomposed by the reproaches of reactionary friends abroad,\r\nLord Aberdeen thought he had some reason to complain of the publication.\r\nIt is not easy to see why. Mr. Gladstone from the first insisted that if\r\nprivate remonstrance did not work 'without elusion or delay,' he would\r\nmake a public appeal. In transmitting the first letter, he described in\r\nvery specific terms his idea that a short time would suffice to show\r\nwhether the private method could be relied upon.[245] The attitude of\r\nthe minister at Vienna, of Fortunato at Naples, and of Castelcicala in\r\nLondon, discovered even to Aberdeen himself how little reasonable hope\r\nthere was of anything being done; elusion and delay was all that he\r\ncould expect. He was forced to give entire credit to Mr. Gladstone's\r\nhorrible story, and was as far as possible from thinking it a detestable\r\nlibel. He never denied the foundation of the case, or the actual state\r\nof the abominable facts. Schwarzenberg never consented to comply with\r\nhis wishes even when writing before the publication. How then could\r\nAberdeen expect that Mr. Gladstone should abandon the set and avowed\r\npurpose with which he had come flaming and resolved to England?\r\n\r\n                         SENSATION IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nIt was exactly because the party with which Mr. Gladstone was allied had\r\nmade itself the supporter of established governments throughout Europe,\r\nthat in his eyes that party became specially responsible for not passing\r\nby in silence any course of conduct, even in a foreign country,\r\nflagrantly at variance with right.[246] And what was there, when at last\r\nthey arrived, in Prince Schwarzenberg's idle dissertations and\r\nrecriminations, winding up with a still more idle sentence about\r\nbringing the charges under the notice of the Neapolitan government, that\r\nshould induce Mr. Gladstone to abandon his purpose? He had something\r\nelse to think of than the scandal to the reactionaries of Europe. 'I\r\nwish it were in your power,' he writes to Lacaita in May, 'to assure any\r\nof those directly interested, in my name, that I am not unfaithful to\r\nthem, and will use every means in my power; feeble they are, and I\r\nlament it; but God is strong and is just and good; and the issue is in\r\nHis hands.' That is what he was thinking of. When he talked of 'the\r\nsacred purposes of humanity' it was not artificial claptrap in a\r\nprotocol.[247]\r\n\r\n'When I consider,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Aberdeen, 'that Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg really knew the state of things at Naples well enough\r\nindependently of me, and then ask myself why did he wait seven weeks\r\nbefore acknowledging a letter relating to the intense sufferings of\r\nhuman beings which were going on day by day and hour by hour, while his\r\npeople were concocting all that trash about Frost and Ernest Jones and\r\nO'Brien, I cannot say that I think the spirit of the letter was\r\ncreditable to him, or very promising as regards these people.' The\r\nNeapolitan government entered the field with a formal reply point by\r\npoint, and Mr. Gladstone met them with a point by point rejoinder. The\r\nmatter did not rest there. Soon after his arrival at home, he had had\r\nsome conversation with John Russell, Palmerston, and other members of\r\nthe government. They were much interested and not at all incredulous.\r\nLord Palmerston's brother kept him too well informed about the state of\r\nthings there for him to be sceptical. 'Gladstone and Molesworth,' wrote\r\nPalmerston, 'say that they were wrong last year in their attacks on my\r\nforeign policy, but they did not know the truth.'[248] Lord Palmerston\r\ndirected copies of Mr. Gladstone's Letters to be sent to the British\r\nrepresentatives in all the courts of Europe, with instructions to give a\r\ncopy to each government. The Neapolitan envoy in London in his turn\r\nrequested him also to send fifteen copies of the pamphlet that had been\r\ngot up on the other side. Palmerston promptly, and in his most\r\ncharacteristic style, vindicated Mr. Gladstone against the charges of\r\noverstatement and hostile intention; warned the Neapolitan government of\r\nthe violent revolution that long-continued and widespread injustice\r\nwould assuredly bring upon them; hoped that they might have set to work\r\nto correct the manifold and grave abuses to which their attention had\r\nbeen drawn; and flatly refused to have anything to do with an official\r\npamphlet 'consisting of a flimsy tissue of bare assertions and reckless\r\ndenials, mixed up with coarse ribaldry and commonplace abuse.' This was\r\nthe kind of thing that gave to Lord Palmerston the best of his power\r\nover the people of England.\r\n\r\n                  ENERGETIC SYMPATHY OF PALMERSTON\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons he spoke with no less warmth. Though he had not\r\nfelt it his duty, he said, to make representations at Naples on a matter\r\nrelating to internal affairs, he thought Mr. Gladstone had done himself\r\ngreat honour. Instead of seeking amusements, diving into volcanoes and\r\nexploring excavated cities, he had visited prisons, descended into\r\ndungeons, examined cases of the victims of illegality and injustice, and\r\nhad then sought to rouse the public opinion of Europe. It was because he\r\nconcurred in this opinion that he had circulated the pamphlet, in the\r\nhope that the European courts might use their influence.[249] As Lord\r\nAberdeen told Madame de Lieven, Mr. Gladstone's pamphlet by the\r\nextraordinary sensation it had created among men of all parties had\r\ngiven a great practical triumph to Palmerston and the foreign office.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of Mr. Gladstone's appeal was an aggravation of\r\nprison rigour. Panizzi was convinced that the king did not know of all\r\nthe iniquities exposed by Mr. Gladstone. At the close of 1851 he\r\nobtained an interview with Ferdinand, and for twenty minutes spoke of\r\nPoerio, Settembrini and the condition of the prisons. The king suddenly\r\ncut short the interview, saying, _Addio, terribile Panizzi_.[250] Faint\r\nstreaks of light from the outside world pierced the gloom of the\r\ndungeons. As time went on, a lady contrived to smuggle in a few pages of\r\nMr. Gladstone's first Letter; and in 1854 the martyrs heard vaguely of\r\nthe action of Cavour. But it was not until 1859 that the tyrant, fearing\r\nthe cry of horror that would go up in Europe if Poerio should die in\r\nchains, or worse than death, should go mad, commuted prison to perpetual\r\nexile,[251] and sixty-six of them were embarked for America. At Lisbon\r\nthey were transferred to an American ship; the captain, either\r\nintimidated or bribed, put in at Queenstown. 'In setting foot on this\r\nfree soil,' Poerio wrote to Mr. Gladstone from the Irish haven (March\r\n12, 1859), 'the first need of my heart was to seek news of you.'\r\nCommunications were speedily opened. The Italians made their way to\r\nBristol, where they were received with sympathy and applause by the\r\npopulation. The deliverance of their country was close at hand.\r\n\r\nNot now, nor for many years to come, did Mr. Gladstone grasp the idea of\r\nItalian unity. It was impossible for him to ignore, but he did\r\nundoubtedly set aside, the fact that every shade and section of Italian\r\nliberalism from Farini on the right, to Mazzini on the furthest left,\r\ninsisted on treating Italy as a political integer, and placed the\r\nindependence of Italy and the expulsion of Austria from Italian soil as\r\nthe first and fundamental article in the creed of reform. Like most of\r\nthe English friends of the Italian cause at this time, except the small\r\nbut earnest group who rallied round the powerful moral genius of\r\nMazzini, he thought only of local freedom and local reforms. 'The purely\r\nabstract idea of Italian nationality,' said Mr. Gladstone at this time,\r\n'makes little impression and finds limited sympathy among ourselves.' 'I\r\nam certain,' he wrote to Panizzi (June 21, 1851), 'that the Italian\r\nhabit of preaching unity and nationality in preference to showing\r\ngrievances produces a revulsion here; for if there are two things on\r\nearth that John Bull hates, they are an abstract proposition and the\r\npope.' 'You need not be afraid, I think,' he told Lord Aberdeen\r\n(December 1, 1851), 'of Mazzinism from me, still less of Kossuth-ism,\r\nwhich means the other _plus_ imposture, Lord Palmerston, and his\r\nnationalities.' But then in 1854 Manin came to England, and failed to\r\npersuade even Lord Palmerston that the unity of Italy was the only clue\r\nto her freedom.[252] The Russian war made it inconvenient to quarrel\r\nwith Austria about Italy. With Mr. Gladstone he made more way. 'Seven to\r\nbreakfast to meet Manin,' says the diary; 'he too is wild.' Not too\r\nwild, however, to work conversion on his host. 'It was my privilege,'\r\nMr. Gladstone afterwards wrote, 'to welcome Manin in London in 1854,\r\nwhen I had long been anxious for reform in Italy, and it was from him\r\nthat, in common with some other Englishmen, I had my first lessons upon\r\nItalian unity as the indispensable basis of all effectual reform under\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of that country.'[253] Yet the page of Dante\r\nholds the lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\n                             THE TEMPORAL POWER\r\n\r\nOn one important element in the complex Italian case at this time, Mr.\r\nGladstone gained a clear view.\r\n\r\n     Some things I have learned in Italy, he wrote to Manning (_January\r\n     26, 1851_), that I did not know before, one in particular. The\r\n     temporal power of the pope, that great, wonderful, and ancient\r\n     erection, is _gone_. The problem has been worked out--the ground is\r\n     mined--the train is laid--a foreign force, in its nature\r\n     transitory, alone stays the hand of those who would complete the\r\n     process by applying the match. This seems, rather than is, a\r\n     digression. When that event comes, it will bring about a great\r\n     shifting of parts--much super-and much subter-position. God grant\r\n     it may be for good. I desire it, because I see plainly that justice\r\n     requires it. Not out of malice to the popedom; for I cannot at this\r\n     moment dare to answer with a confident affirmative, the question, a\r\n     very solemn one--Ten, twenty, fifty years hence, will there be any\r\n     other body in western Christendom witnessing for fixed dogmatic\r\n     truth? With all my heart I wish it well (though perhaps not wholly\r\n     what the consistory might think agreed with the meaning of the\r\n     term)--it would be to me a joyous day in which I should see it\r\n     really doing well.\r\n\r\nVarious ideas of this kind set him to work on the large and curious\r\nenterprise, long since forgotten, of translating Farini's volumes on the\r\nRoman State from 1815 down to 1850. According to the entries in his\r\ndiary he began and finished the translation of a large portion of the\r\nbook at Naples in 1850--dictating and writing almost daily. Three of the\r\nfour volumes of this English translation were done with extraordinary\r\nspeed by Mr. Gladstone's own hand, and the fourth was done under his\r\ndirection.[254] His object was, without any reference to Italian unity,\r\nto give an illustration of the actual working of the temporal power in\r\nits latest history. It is easy to understand how the theme fitted in\r\nwith the widest topics of his life; the nature of theocratic\r\ngovernment; the possibility (to borrow Cavour's famous phrase) of a free\r\nchurch in a free state; and above all,--as he says to Manning now, and\r\nsaid to all the world twenty years later in the day of the Vatican\r\ndecrees,--the mischiefs done to the cause of what he took for saving\r\ntruth by evil-doing in the heart and centre of the most powerful of all\r\nthe churches. His translation of Farini, followed by his article on the\r\nsame subject in the _Edinburgh_ in 1852, was his first blast against\r\n'the covetous, domineering, implacable policy represented in the term\r\nUltramontanism; the winding up higher and higher, tighter and tighter,\r\nof the hierarchical spirit, in total disregard of those elements by\r\nwhich it ought to be checked and balanced; and an unceasing, covert,\r\nsmouldering war against human freedom, even in its most modest and\r\nretiring forms of private life and of the individual conscience.' With\r\nan energy not unworthy of Burke at his fiercest, he denounces the fallen\r\nand impotent regality of the popes as temporal sovereigns. 'A monarchy\r\nsustained by foreign armies, smitten with the curse of social\r\nbarrenness, unable to strike root downward or bear fruit upward, the\r\nsun, the air, the rain soliciting in vain its sapless and rotten\r\nboughs--such a monarchy, even were it not a monarchy of priests, and\r\ntenfold more because it is one, stands out a foul blot upon the face of\r\ncreation, an offence to Christendom and to mankind.'[255] As we shall\r\nsoon see, he was just as wrathful, just as impassioned and as eloquent,\r\nwhen, in a memorable case in his own country, the temporal power\r\nbethought itself of a bill for meddling with the rights of a Roman\r\nvoluntary church.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241] For the two _Letters to Lord Aberdeen_, see _Gleanings_, iv.\r\n\r\n[242] There was a slight discrepancy between the two on this point, Mr.\r\nGladstone describing the position as above, Aberdeen believing that it\r\nwas by his persuasion that Mr. Gladstone dropped his intention of\r\ninstant publicity. Probably the latter used such urgent language about\r\nan appeal to the public opinion of England and Europe, that Lord\r\nAberdeen supposed it to be an immediate and not an ulterior resort.\r\nAberdeen to Castelcicala, September 15, 1851, and Mr. Gladstone to\r\nAberdeen, October 3.\r\n\r\n[243] The mere announcement caused such a demand that a second edition\r\nwas required almost before the first was published.\r\n\r\n[244] _Wesleyan Methodist Magazine_, October 1851. _Protestant\r\nMagazine_, September 1851.\r\n\r\n[245] Gladstone to Lord Aberdeen, September 16, 1851.\r\n\r\n[246] Mr. Gladstone in an undated draft letter to Castelcicala.\r\n\r\n[247] The one point on which Lord Aberdeen had a right to complain was\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone did not take his advice. As the point revives in Lord\r\nStanmore's excellent life of his father, it may be worth while to\r\nreproduce two further passages from Mr. Gladstone's letter to Lord\r\nAberdeen of July 7, 1851. Before publishing the second of the two\r\nLetters, he wrote to Lord Aberdeen: 'I ought perhaps to have asked your\r\nformal permission for the act of publication; but _I thought that I\r\ndistinctly inferred it from a recent conversation with you as to the\r\nmode of proceeding_'--(Mr. Gladstone to Lord Aberdeen, July 7, 1851).\r\nThen he proceeds as to the new supplementary publication: 'If it be\r\ndisagreeable to you in any manner to be the recipient of such sad\r\ncommunications, or if you think it better for any other reason, I would\r\nput the further matter into another form.' In answer to this, Lord\r\nAberdeen seems not to have done any more to refuse leave to associate\r\nhis name with the second Letter, than he had done to withdraw the\r\nassumed leave for the association of his name with the first.\r\n\r\n[248] Ashley, _Palmerston_, ii. p. 179.\r\n\r\n[249] August 7, 1851. _Hansard_, cxv. p. 1949.\r\n\r\n[250] Fagan's _Life of Panizzi_, ii. pp. 102-3.\r\n\r\n[251] On the share of Mr. Gladstone's Letters in leading indirectly to\r\nthis decision, see the address of Baldacchini, _Della Vita e de' Tempi\r\ndi Carlo Poerio_ (1867), p. 58.\r\n\r\n[252] _Gleanings_, iv. pp. 188, 195.

I confess I look,\r\n     if not with suspicion, at least with disapprobation on any one who\r\n     is disposed to treat party connections as matters of small\r\n     importance. My opinion is that party ties closely appertain to\r\n     those principles of confidence which we entertain for the House of\r\n     Commons.--GLADSTONE (1852).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, on the morning of his arrival from his Italian journey\r\n(February 26, 1851) Mr. Gladstone found that he was urgently required to\r\nmeet Lord Stanley. Mortified by more than one repulse at the opening of\r\nthe session, the whigs had resigned. The Queen sent for the\r\nprotectionist leader. Stanley said that he was not then prepared to form\r\na government, but that if other combinations failed, he would make the\r\nattempt. Lord John Russell was once more summoned to the palace, this\r\ntime along with Aberdeen and Graham--the first move in a critical march\r\ntowards the fated coalition between whigs and Peelites. The negotiation\r\nbroke off on the No Popery bill; Lord John was committed to it, the\r\nother two strongly disapproved. The Queen next wished Aberdeen to\r\nundertake the task. Apparently not without some lingering doubts, he\r\ndeclined on the good ground that the House of Commons would not stand\r\nhis attitude on papal aggression.[256] Then according to promise Lord\r\nStanley tried his hand. Proceedings were suspended for some days until\r\nMr. Gladstone should be on the ground. He no sooner reached Carlton\r\nGardens, than Lord Lincoln arrived, eager to dissuade him from accepting\r\noffice. Before the discussion had gone far, the tory whip hurried in\r\nfrom Stanley, begging for an immediate visit.\r\n\r\n     I promised, says Mr. Gladstone, to go directly after seeing Lord\r\n     Aberdeen. But he came back with a fresh message to go at once, and\r\n     _hear_ what Stanley had to say. I did not like to stickle, and\r\n     went. He told me his object was that I should take office with\r\n     him--_any_ office, subject to the reservation that the foreign\r\n     department was offered to Canning, but if he declined it was open\r\n     to me, along with others of which he named the colonial office and\r\n     the board of trade. Nothing was said of the leadership of the House\r\n     of Commons, but his anxiety was evident to have any occupant but\r\n     one for the foreign office. I told him, I should ask no questions\r\n     and make no remark on these points, as none of them would\r\n     constitute a difficulty with me, provided no preliminary obstacle\r\n     were found to intervene. Stanley then said that he proposed to\r\n     maintain the system of free trade generally, but to put a duty of\r\n     five or six shillings on corn. I heard him pretty much in silence,\r\n     but with an intense sense of relief; feeling that if he had put\r\n     protection in abeyance, I might have had a most difficult question\r\n     to decide, whereas now I had no question at all. I thought,\r\n     however, it might be well that I should still see Lord Aberdeen\r\n     before giving him an answer; and told him I would do so. I asked\r\n     him also what was his intention with respect to papal aggression.\r\n     He said that this measure was hasty and intemperate as well as\r\n     ineffective; and that he thought something much better might result\r\n     from a comprehensive and deliberate inquiry. I told him I was\r\n     utterly against all penal legislation and against the ministerial\r\n     bill, but that I did not on principle object to inquiry; that, on\r\n     general as well as on personal grounds, I wished well to his\r\n     undertakings; and that I would see Lord Aberdeen, but that what he\r\n     had told me about corn constituted, I must not conceal from him,\r\n     'an enormous difficulty.' I used this expression for the purpose of\r\n     preparing him to receive the answer it was plain I must give; he\r\n     told me his persevering would probably depend on me.\r\n\r\n                             DECLINES OFFICE\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone next hastened to Lord Aberdeen, and learned what had been\r\ngoing on during his absence abroad. He learned also the clear opinions\r\nheld by Aberdeen and Graham against No Popery legislation, and noticed\r\nit as remarkable that so many minds should arrive independently at the\r\nsame conclusion on a new question, and in opposition to the overwhelming\r\nmajority. 'I then,' he continues, 'went on to the levee, saw Lord\r\nNormanby and others, and began to bruit abroad the fame of the\r\nNeapolitan government. Immediately after leaving the levee (where I also\r\nsaw Canning, told him what I meant to do, and gathered that he would do\r\nthe like), I changed my clothes and went to give Lord Stanley my answer,\r\nat which he did not show the least surprise. He said he would still\r\npersevere, though with little hope. I think I told him it seemed to me\r\nhe ought to do so. I was not five minutes with him this second\r\ntime.'[257]\r\n\r\nThe protectionists having failed, and the Peelites standing aside, the\r\nwhigs came back, most of them well aware that they could not go on for\r\nlong. The events of the late crisis had given Mr. Gladstone the hope\r\nthat Graham would effectively place himself at the head of the Peelites,\r\nand that they would now at length begin to take an independent course of\r\ntheir own. 'But it soon appeared that, unconsciously I think more than\r\nconsciously, he is set upon the object of avoiding the responsibility\r\neither of taking the government with the Peel squadron, or of letting in\r\nStanley and his friends.' Here was the weak point in a strong and\r\ncapable character. When Graham died ten years after this (1861), Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to a friend, 'On administrative questions, for the last\r\ntwenty years and more, I had more spontaneous recourse to him for\r\nadvice, than to all other colleagues together.' In some of the\r\nfoundations of character no two men could be more unlike. One of his\r\nclosest allies talks to Graham of 'your sombre temperament.' 'My\r\nforebodings are always gloomy,' says Graham himself; 'I shudder on the\r\nbrink of the torrent.' All accounts agree that he was a good counsellor\r\nin cabinet, a first-rate manager of business, a good if rather pompous\r\nspeaker, admirably loyal and single-minded, but half-ruined by intense\r\ntimidity. I have heard nobody use warmer language of commendation about\r\nhim than Mr. Bright. But nature had not made him for a post of chief\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nIt by and by appeared that the Duke of Newcastle, known to us hitherto\r\nas Lord Lincoln, coveted the post of leader, but Mr. Gladstone thought\r\nthat on every ground Lord Aberdeen was the person entitled to hold it.\r\n'I made,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'my views distinctly known to the duke. He\r\ntook no offence. I do not know what communications he may have held with\r\nothers. But the upshot was that Lord Aberdeen became our leader. And\r\nthis result was obtained without any shock or conflict.'[258]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                 BILL AGAINST ECCLESIASTICAL TITLES\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1850 the people of this country were frightened out of\r\ntheir senses by a document from the Vatican, dividing England into\r\ndioceses bearing territorial titles and appointing Cardinal Wiseman to\r\nbe Archbishop of Westminster. The uproar was tremendous. Lord John\r\nRussell cast fuel upon the flame in a perverse letter to the Bishop of\r\nDurham (Nov. 4, 1850). In this unhappy document he accepted the\r\ndescription of the aggression of the pope upon our protestantism as\r\ninsolent and insidious, declared his indignation to be greater even than\r\nhis alarm, and even his alarm at the aggressions of a foreign sovereign\r\nto be less than at the conduct of unworthy sons of the church of England\r\nwithin her own gates. He wound up by declaring that the great mass of\r\nthe nation looked with contempt upon the mummeries of superstition.\r\nJustified indeed was Bright's stern rebuke to a prime minister of the\r\nQueen who thus allowed himself to offend and to indict eight millions of\r\nhis countrymen, recklessly to create fresh discords between the Irish\r\nand English nations, and to perpetuate animosities that the last\r\nfive-and-twenty years had done so much to assuage. Having thus\r\nprecipitately committed himself, the minister was forced to legislate.\r\n'I suspect,' wrote Mr. Gladstone to his great friend, Sir Walter James,\r\n'John Russell has more rocks and breakers ahead than he reckoned upon\r\nwhen he dipped his pen in gall to smite first the pope, but most those\r\nwho not being papists are such traitors and fools as really to mean\r\nsomething when they say, \"I believe in one Holy Catholic Church.\"' There\r\nwas some division of opinion in the cabinet,[259] but a bill was\r\nsettled, and the temper of the times may be gauged by the fact that\r\nleave to introduce it was given by the overwhelming majority of 395\r\nvotes to 63.\r\n\r\nIn his own language, Mr. Gladstone lamented and disapproved of the\r\npope's proceeding extremely, and had taken care to say so in parliament\r\ntwo and a half years before, when 'Lord John Russell, if he had chosen,\r\ncould have stopped it; but the government and the press were alike\r\nsilent at that period.'[260] His attitude is succinctly described in a\r\nletter to Greswell, his Oxford chairman, in 1852: 'Do not let it be\r\nasserted without contradiction that I ever felt or counselled\r\nindifference in regard to the division of England into Romish dioceses.\r\nSo far is this from being the truth that shortly after I was elected,\r\n_when the government were encouraging the pope to proceed_, and when\r\nthere was yet time to stop the measure (which I deplore sincerely) by\r\namicable means, I took the opportunity in the House (as did Sir R.\r\nInglis, I _think_ a little later), of trying to draw attention to it.\r\nBut it was nobody's game then, and the subject fell to the ground.\r\nAmicable prevention I desired; spiritual and ecclesiastical resistance I\r\nheartily approved; but while I say this, I cannot recede from one inch\r\nof the ground I took in opposing the bill, and I would far rather quit\r\nparliament for ever than not have voted against so pernicious a\r\nmeasure.'\r\n\r\nOther matters, as we have seen, brought on a ministerial crisis, the\r\nbill was stopped, and after the crisis was over the measure came to\r\nlife again with changes making it still more futile for its ends. The\r\nPeelites while, like Mr. Bright, 'despising and loathing' the language\r\nof the Vatican and the Flaminian Gate, had all of them without concert\r\ntaken this outburst of prejudice and passion at its right value, and all\r\nresolved to resist legislation. How, they asked, could you tolerate the\r\nRoman catholic religion, if you would not tolerate its tenet of the\r\necclesiastical supremacy of the pope; and what sort of toleration of\r\nsuch a tenet would that be, which forbade the pope to name ecclesiastics\r\nto exercise the spiritual authority exercised in any other voluntary\r\nepiscopal church, Scottish, colonial, or another? Why was it more of a\r\nusurpation for the pope to make a new Archbishop of Westminster, than to\r\nadminister London by the old form of vicars apostolic? Was not the\r\naction of the pope, after all, a secondary consideration, and the frenzy\r\nreally and in essence an explosion of popular wrath against the\r\nPuseyites? What was to be thought of a prime minister who, at such risk\r\nto the public peace, tried to turn the ferment to account for the sake\r\nof strengthening his tottering government? To all this there was no\r\nrational reply; and even the editor of a powerful newspaper that every\r\nmorning blew up the coals, admitted to Greville that 'he thought the\r\nwhole thing humbug and a pack of nonsense!'[261]\r\n\r\n                    GREAT SPEECH AGAINST THE BILL\r\n\r\nThe debate on the second reading was marked by a little brutality and\r\nmuch sanctimony. Mr. Gladstone (March 25, 1851) spoke to a House\r\npractically almost solid against him. Yet his superb resources as an\r\norator, his transparent depth of conviction, the unmistakeable proofs\r\nthat his whole heart was in the matter, mastered his audience and made\r\nthe best of them in their hearts ashamed. He talked of Boniface VIII.\r\nand Honorius IX.; he pursued a long and close historical demonstration\r\nof the earnest desire of the lay catholics of this country for diocesan\r\nbishops as against vicars apostolic; he moved among bulls and rescripts,\r\nbriefs and pastorals and canon law, with as much ease as if he had been\r\narguing about taxes and tariffs. Through it all the House watched and\r\nlistened in enchantment, as to a magnificent tragedian playing a noble\r\npart in a foreign tongue. They did not apprehend every point, nor were\r\nthey converted, but they felt a man with the orator's quality of taking\r\nfire and kindling fire at a moral idea. They felt his command of the\r\nwhole stock of fact and of principle belonging to his topics, as with\r\nthe air and the power of a heroic master he cleared the way before him\r\ntowards his purpose. Along with complete grasp of details, went grasp of\r\nsome of the most important truths in the policy of a modern state. He\r\nclearly perceived the very relevant fact, so often overlooked by\r\nadvocates of the free church in a free state, that 'there is no\r\nreligious body in the world where religious offices do not in a certain\r\ndegree conjoin with temporal incidents.' But this did not affect the\r\npower of his stroke, as he insisted on respect for the frontier--no\r\nscientific frontier--between temporal and spiritual. 'You speak of the\r\nprogress of the Roman catholic religion, and you pretend to meet that\r\nprogress by a measure false in principle as it is ludicrous in extent.\r\nYou must meet the progress of that spiritual system by the progress of\r\nanother; you can never do it by penal enactments. Here, once for all, I\r\nenter my most solemn, earnest, and deliberate protest against all\r\nattempts to meet the spiritual dangers of our church by temporal\r\nlegislation of a penal character.' The whole speech is in all its\r\nelements and aspects one of the great orator's three or four most\r\nconspicuous masterpieces, and the reader would not forgive me if I\r\nfailed to transcribe its resplendent close. He went back to a passage of\r\nLord John Russell's on the Maynooth bill of 1845. 'I never heard,' said\r\nMr. Gladstone, 'a more impressive passage delivered by any statesman at\r\nany time in this House.'\r\n\r\n     The noble lord referred to some beautiful and touching lines of\r\n     Virgil, which the house will not regret to hear:--\r\n\r\n       'Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis\r\n        Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro,\r\n        Exesa inveniet scabra rubigine pila;\r\n        Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes,\r\n        Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulcris.'[262]\r\n\r\n     And he said, upon those scenes where battles have been fought, the\r\n     hand of nature effaces the traces of the wrath of man, and the\r\n     cultivator of the soil in following times finds the rusted arms,\r\n     and looks upon them with calm and joy, as the memorials of\r\n     forgotten strife, and as quickening his sense of the blessings of\r\n     his peaceful occupation. The noble lord went on to say, in\r\n     reference to the powerful opposition then offered to the bill for\r\n     the endowment of Maynooth, that it seems as if upon the questions\r\n     of religious freedom, our strife is never to cease, and our arms\r\n     are never to rust. Would any man, who heard the noble lord deliver\r\n     these impressive sentiments, have believed not only that the strife\r\n     with respect to religious liberty was to be revived with a greater\r\n     degree of acerbity, in the year 1851, but that the noble lord\r\n     himself was to be a main agent in its revival--that his was to be\r\n     the head that was to wear the helmet, and his the hand that was to\r\n     grasp the spear? My conviction is, that this great subject of\r\n     religious freedom is not to be dealt with, as one of the ordinary\r\n     matters in which you may, with safety or with honour, do to-day and\r\n     undo to-morrow. This great people, whom we have the honour to\r\n     represent, moves slowly in politics and legislation; but, although\r\n     it moves slowly, it moves steadily. The principle of religious\r\n     freedom, its adaptation to our modern state, and its compatibility\r\n     with ancient institutions, was a principle which you did not adopt\r\n     in haste. It was a principle well tried in struggle and conflict.\r\n     It was a principle which gained the assent of one public man after\r\n     another. It was a principle which ultimately triumphed, after you\r\n     had spent upon it half a century of agonising struggle. And now\r\n     what are you going to do? You have arrived at the division of the\r\n     century. Are you going to repeat Penelope's process, but without\r\n     the purpose of Penelope? Are you going to spend the decay and the\r\n     dusk of the nineteenth century in undoing the great work which with\r\n     so much pain and difficulty your greatest men have been achieving\r\n     during its daybreak and its youth? Surely not. Oh, recollect the\r\n     functions you have to perform in the face of the world. Recollect\r\n     that Europe and the whole of the civilised world look to England at\r\n     this moment not less, no, but even more than ever they looked to\r\n     her before, as the mistress and guide of nations, in regard to the\r\n     great work of civil legislation. And what is it they chiefly admire\r\n     in England? It is not the rapidity with which you form\r\n     constitutions and broach abstract theories. On the contrary; they\r\n     know that nothing is so distasteful to you as abstract theories,\r\n     and that you are proverbial for resisting what is new until you are\r\n     well assured by gradual effort, by progressive trials, and\r\n     beneficial tendency. But they know that when you make a step\r\n     forward you keep it. They know that there is reality and honesty,\r\n     strength and substance, about your proceedings. They know that you\r\n     are not a monarchy to-day, a republic to-morrow, and a military\r\n     despotism the day after. They know that you have been happily\r\n     preserved from irrational vicissitudes that have marked the career\r\n     of the greatest and noblest among the neighbouring nations. Your\r\n     fathers and yourselves have earned this brilliant character for\r\n     England. Do not forfeit it. Do not allow it to be tarnished or\r\n     impaired. Show, I beseech you--have the courage to show the pope of\r\n     Rome, and his cardinals, and his church, that England too, as well\r\n     as Rome, has her _semper eadem_; and that when she has once adopted\r\n     some great principle of legislation, which is destined to influence\r\n     the national character, to draw the dividing lines of her policy\r\n     for ages to come, and to affect the whole nature of her influence\r\n     and her standing among the nations of the world--show that when she\r\n     has done this slowly, and done it deliberately, she has done it\r\n     once for all; and that she will then no more retrace her steps than\r\n     the river that bathes this giant city can flow back upon its\r\n     source. The character of England is in our hands. Let us feel the\r\n     responsibility that belongs to us, and let us rely on it; if to-day\r\n     we make this step backwards, it is one which hereafter we shall\r\n     have to retrace with pain. We cannot change the profound and\r\n     resistless tendencies of the age towards religious liberty. It is\r\n     our business to guide and to control their application; do this you\r\n     may, but to endeavour to turn them backwards is the sport of\r\n     children, done by the hands of men, and every effort you may make\r\n     in that direction will recoil upon you in disaster and disgrace.\r\n     The noble lord appealed to gentlemen who sit behind me, in the\r\n     names of Hampden and Pym. I have great reverence for these in one\r\n     portion at least of their political career, because they were men\r\n     energetically engaged in resisting oppression. But I would rather\r\n     have heard Hampden and Pym quoted on any other subject than one\r\n     which relates to the mode of legislation or the policy to be\r\n     adopted with our Roman catholic fellow-citizens, because, if there\r\n     was one blot on their escutcheon, if there was one painful--I would\r\n     almost say odious--feature in the character of the party among whom\r\n     they were the most distinguished chiefs, it was the bitter and\r\n     ferocious intolerance which in them became the more powerful\r\n     because it was directed against the Roman catholics alone. I would\r\n     appeal in other names to gentlemen who sit on this side of the\r\n     House. If Hampden and Pym were friends of freedom, so were\r\n     Clarendon and Newcastle, so were the gentlemen who sustained the\r\n     principles of loyalty.... They were not always seeking to tighten\r\n     the chains and deepen the brand. Their disposition was to relax the\r\n     severity of the law, and attract the affections of their Roman\r\n     catholic fellow-subjects to the constitution by treating them as\r\n     brethren.... We are a minority insignificant in point of numbers.\r\n     We are more insignificant still, because we are but knots and\r\n     groups of two or three, we have no power of cohesion, no ordinary\r\n     bond of union. What is it that binds us together against you, but\r\n     the conviction that we have on our side the principle of\r\n     justice--the conviction that we shall soon have on our side the\r\n     strength of public opinion (_oh, oh!_). I am sure I have not wished\r\n     to say a syllable that would wound the feelings of any man, and if\r\n     in the warmth of argument such expressions should have escaped me,\r\n     I wish them unsaid. But above all we are sustained by the sense of\r\n     justice which we feel belongs to the cause we are defending; and we\r\n     are, I trust, well determined to follow that bright star of\r\n     justice, beaming from the heavens, whithersoever it may lead.\r\n\r\nAll this was of no avail, just as the same arguments and temper on two\r\nother occasions of the same eternal theme in his life,[263] were to be\r\nof no avail. Disraeli spoke strongly against the line taken by the\r\nPeelites. The second reading was carried by 438 against 95, one-third\r\neven of this minority being Irish catholics, and the rest mainly\r\nPeelites, 'a limited but accomplished school,' as Disraeli styled them.\r\nHume asked Mr. Gladstone for his speech for publication to circulate\r\namong the dissenters who, he said, know nothing about religious\r\nliberty. It was something, however, to find Mr. Gladstone, the greatest\r\nliving churchman, and Bright, the greatest living nonconformist, voting\r\nin the same lobby. The fight was stiff, and was kept up until the end of\r\nthe summer. The weapon that had been forged in this blazing furnace by\r\nthese clumsy armourers proved blunt and worthless; the law was from the\r\nfirst a dead letter, and it was struck out of the statute book in 1871\r\nin Mr. Gladstone's own administration.[264]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                      FALL OF THE RUSSELL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIn the autumn (1851) a committee of the whig cabinet, now reinforced by\r\nthe admission for the first time of Lord Granville, was named to prepare\r\na reform bill. Palmerston, no friend to reform, fell into restive\r\ncourses that finally upset the coach. The cabinet, early in November,\r\nsettled that he should not receive Kossuth, and he complied; but he\r\nreceived a public deputation and an address complimenting him for his\r\nexertions on Kossuth's behalf. The court at this proceeding took lively\r\noffence, and the Queen requested the prime minister to ascertain the\r\nopinion of the cabinet upon it. Such an appeal by the sovereign from the\r\nminister to the cabinet was felt by them to be unconstitutional, and\r\nthough they did not conceal from Palmerston their general\r\ndissatisfaction, they declined to adopt any resolution. Before the year\r\nended Palmerston persisted in taking an unauthorised line of his own\r\nupon Napoleon's _coup d'etat_ (this time for once not on the side of\r\nfreedom against despotism), and Lord John closed a correspondence\r\nbetween them by telling him that he could not advise the Queen to leave\r\nthe seals of the foreign department any longer in his hands. This\r\ndismissal of Palmerston introduced a new element of disruption and\r\nconfusion, for the fallen minister had plenty of friends. Lord Lansdowne\r\nwas very uneasy about reform, and talked ominously about preferring to\r\nbe a supporter rather than a member of the government; and whig\r\ndissensions, though less acute in type, threatened a perplexity as sharp\r\nin the way of a stable administration, as the discords among\r\nconservatives.\r\n\r\nLord John (Jan. 14, 1852) next asked his cabinet whether an offer should\r\nbe made to Graham. A long discussion followed; whether Graham alone\r\nwould do them any good; whether the Peelites, considering themselves as\r\na party, might join, but would not consent to be absorbed; whether an\r\noffer to them was to be a persistent attempt in good faith or only a\r\ndevice to mend the parliamentary case, if the offer were made and\r\nrefused. Two or three of the whig ministers, true to the church\r\ntraditions of the caste, made great difficulties about the Puseyite\r\nnotions of Newcastle and Mr. Gladstone. 'Gladstone,' writes one of them,\r\n'is a Jesuit, and more Peelite than I believe was Peel himself.' In the\r\nend Lord John Russell and his men met parliament without any new\r\nsupport. Their tottering life was short, and it was an amendment moved\r\nby Palmerston (Feb. 20) on a clause in a militia bill, that slit the\r\nthread. The hostile majority was only eleven, but other perils lay\r\npretty thick in front. The ministers resigned, and Lord Stanley, who had\r\nnow become Earl of Derby, had no choice but to give his followers their\r\nchance. The experiment that seemed so impossible when Bentinck first\r\ntried it, of forming a new third party in the state, seemed up to this\r\npoint to have prospered, and the protectionists had a definite\r\nexistence. The ministers were nearly all new to public office, and\r\nseventeen of them were for the first time sworn of the privy council in\r\na single day. One jest was that the cabinet consisted of three men and a\r\nhalf--Derby, Disraeli, St. Leonards, and a worthy fractional personage\r\nat the admiralty.\r\n\r\nSending to his wife at Hawarden a provisional list (Feb. 23), Mr.\r\nGladstone doubts the way in which the offices were distributed:--'It is\r\nnot good, as compared I mean with what it should have been. Disraeli\r\ncould not have been worse placed than at the exchequer. Henley could\r\nnot have been worse than at the board of trade. T. Baring, who would\r\nhave been their best chancellor of the exchequer, seems to have\r\ndeclined. Herries would have been much better than Disraeli for that\r\nparticular place. I suppose Lord Malmesbury is temporary foreign\r\nsecretary, to hold the place for S. Canning. What does not appear on the\r\nface of the case is, who is to lead the House of Commons, and about that\r\neverybody seems to be in the dark....'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\n                        FIRST DERBY ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe first Derby administration, thus formed and covering the year 1852,\r\nmarks a highly interesting stage in Mr. Gladstone's career. 'The key to\r\nmy position,' as he afterwards said, 'was that my opinions went one way,\r\nmy lingering sympathies the other.' His opinions looked towards\r\nliberalism, his sympathies drew him to his first party. It was the\r\nPeelites who had now been thrown into the case of a dubious third party.\r\nAt the end of February Mr. Gladstone sought Lord Aberdeen, looking 'to\r\nhis weight, his prudence, and his kindliness of disposition as the main\r\nanchor of their section. His tone has usually been, during the last few\r\nyears, that of anxiety to reunite the fragments and reconstruct the\r\nconservative party, but yesterday, particularly at the commencement of\r\nour conversation, he seemed to lean the other way; spoke kindly of Lord\r\nDerby and wished that _he_ could be extricated from the company with\r\nwhich he is associated; said that though called a despot all his life,\r\nhe himself had always been, and was now, friendly to a liberal policy.\r\nHe did not, however, like the reform question in Lord John's hands; but\r\nhe considered, I thought (and if so he differed from me), that on church\r\nquestions we all might co-operate with him securely.' Mr. Gladstone, on\r\nthe contrary, insisted that their duty plainly was to hold themselves\r\nclear and free from whig and Derbyite alike, so as to be prepared to\r\ntake whatever of three courses might, after the defeat of protectionist\r\nproposals, seem most honourable--whether conservative reconstruction, or\r\nliberal conjunction, or Peelism single-handed. The last he described as\r\ntheir least natural position; for, he urged, they might be 'liberal in\r\nthe sense of Peel, working out a liberal policy through the medium of\r\nthe conservative party.' To that procrastinating view Mr. Gladstone\r\nstood tenaciously, and his course now is one of the multitudinous\r\nillustrations of his constant abhorrence of premature committal, and the\r\ntaking of a second step before the first.\r\n\r\nAfter Aberdeen he approached Graham, who proceeded to use language that\r\nseemed to point to his virtual return to his old friends of the liberal\r\nparty, for the reader will not forget the striking circumstance that the\r\nnew head of a conservative government, and the most trusted of the\r\ncabinet colleagues of Peel, had both of them begun official life in the\r\nreform ministry of Lord Grey. Graham said he had a very high opinion of\r\nLord Derby's talents and character, and that Lord J. Russell had\r\ncommitted many errors, but that looking at the two as they stood, he\r\nthought that the opinions of Lord Derby as a whole were more dangerous\r\nto the country than those of Lord John. Mr. Gladstone said it did not\r\nappear to him that the question lay between these two; but Graham's\r\nreception of this remark implied a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nLincoln, now Duke of Newcastle, he found obdurate in another direction,\r\nspeaking with great asperity against Lord Derby and his party; he would\r\nmake no vows as to junction, not even that he would not join Disraeli;\r\nbut he thought this government must be opposed and overthrown; then\r\nthose who led the charge against it would reap the reward; if the\r\nPeelites did not place themselves in a prominent position, others would.\r\nThey had a further conversation. The duke told him that Beresford, the\r\nwhip, had sent out orders to tory newspapers to run them down; that the\r\nsame worthy had said 'The Peelites, let them go to hell.' Mr. Gladstone\r\nreplied that Beresford's language was not a good test of the feelings of\r\nhis party, and that his violence and that of other people was stimulated\r\nby what they imagined or heard of the Peelites. Newcastle persisted in\r\nhis disbelief in the government. 'During this conversation, held on a\r\nsofa at the Carlton, we were rather warm; and I said to him, \"It\r\nappears to me that you do not believe this party to be composed even of\r\nmen of honour or of gentlemen.\"... He clung to the idea that we were\r\nhereafter to form a party of our own, containing all the good elements\r\nof both parties. To which I replied, the country cannot be governed by a\r\nthird or middle party unless it be for a time only, and on the whole I\r\nthought a liberal policy would be worked out with greater security to\r\nthe country through the medium of the conservative party, and I thought\r\na position like Peel's on the liberal side of that party preferable,\r\ncomparing all advantages and disadvantages, to the conservative side of\r\nthe liberal party. And when he spoke of the tories as the obstructive\r\nbody I said not all of them--for instance Mr. Pitt, Mr. Canning, Mr.\r\nHuskisson, and in some degree Lord Londonderry and Lord Liverpool.'\r\n\r\n                       FOUR SHADES OF PEELITES\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all these discussions was the discovery that there were at\r\nleast four distinct shades among the Peelites. 'Newcastle stands nearly\r\nalone, if not quite, in the rather high-flown idea that we are to create\r\nand lead a great, virtuous, powerful intelligent party, neither the\r\nactual conservative nor the actual liberal party but a new one. Apart\r\nfrom these witcheries, Graham was ready to take his place in the liberal\r\nranks; Cardwell, Fitzroy and Oswald would I think have gone with him, as\r\nF. Peel and Sir C. Douglas went before him. But this section has been\r\narrested, not thoroughly amalgamated, owing to Graham. Thirdly, there\r\nare the great bulk of the Peelites from Goulburn downwards, more or less\r\nundisguisedly anticipating junction with Lord Derby, and avowing that\r\nfree trade is their only point of difference. Lastly myself, and I think\r\nI am with Lord Aberdeen and S. Herbert, who have nearly the same desire,\r\nbut feel that the matter is too crude, too difficult and important for\r\nanticipating any conclusion, and that our clear line of duty is\r\nindependence, until the question of protection shall be settled.' (March\r\n28, 1852.)\r\n\r\nThe personal composition of this section deserves a sentence. In 1835,\r\nduring Peel's short government, the whig phalanx opposed to it in the\r\nHouse of Commons consisted of John Russell and seven others.[265] Of\r\nthese eight all were alive in 1851, seven of them in the then existing\r\ncabinet; six of the eight still in the Commons. On the other hand,\r\nPeel's cabinet began its career thus manned in the Commons--Peel,\r\nStanley, Graham, Hardinge, Knatchbull, Goulburn. Of these only the last\r\nremained in his old position. Peel and Knatchbull were dead; Stanley in\r\nthe Lords and separated; Graham isolated; Hardinge in the Lords and by\r\nway of having retired. Nor was the band very large even as recruited. Of\r\nex-cabinet ministers there were but three commoners; Goulburn, Herbert,\r\nGladstone. And of others who had held important offices there were only\r\navailable, Clerk, Cardwell, Sir J. Young, H. Corry. The Lords\r\ncontributed Aberdeen, Newcastle, Canning,[266] St. Germains and the Duke\r\nof Argyll. Such, as counted off by Mr. Gladstone, was the Peelite staff.\r\n\r\nGraham in April made his own position definitely liberal, or 'whig and\r\nsomething more,' in so pronounced a way as to cut him off from the\r\nGladstonian subdivision or main body of the Peelites. Mr. Gladstone read\r\nthe speech in which this departure was taken, 'with discomfort and\r\nsurprise.' He instantly went to read to Lord Aberdeen some of the more\r\npungent passages; one or two consultations were held with Newcastle and\r\nGoulburn; and all agreed that Graham's words were decisive. 'I mentioned\r\nthat some of them were coming to 5 Carlton Gardens in the course of the\r\nafternoon (April 20); and my first wish was that now Lord Aberdeen\r\nhimself would go and tell them how we stood upon Graham's speech. To\r\nthis they were all opposed; and they seemed to feel that as we had had\r\nno meeting yet, it would seem ungracious and unkind to an old friend to\r\nhold one by way of ovation over his departure. It was therefore agreed\r\nthat I should acquaint Young it was their wish that he should tell any\r\none who might come, that we, who were there present, looked upon our\r\npolitical connection with Graham as dissolved by the Carlisle\r\nspeech.'[267]\r\n\r\n                        ATTITUDE OF GRAHAM\r\n\r\nThe temporary parting from Graham was conducted with a degree of good\r\nfeeling that is a pattern for such occasions in politics. In writing to\r\nMr. Gladstone (Mar. 29, 1852), and speaking of his colleagues in Peel's\r\ngovernment, Graham says, 'I have always felt that my age and position\r\nwere different from theirs: that the habits and connections of my early\r\npolitical life, though broken, gave to me a bias, which to them was not\r\ncongenial; and since the death of our great master and friend, I have\r\nalways feared that the time might arrive when we must separate. You\r\nintimate the decision that party connection must no longer subsist\r\nbetween us. I submit to your decision with regret; but at parting I hope\r\nthat you will retain towards me some feelings of esteem and regard, such\r\nas I can never cease to entertain towards you; and though political\r\nfriendships are often short-lived, having known each other well, we\r\nshall continue, I trust, to maintain kindly relations. It is a pleasure\r\nto me to remember that we have no cause of complaint against each\r\nother.' 'I have to thank you,' Mr. Gladstone replies, 'for the unvarying\r\nkindness of many years, to acknowledge all the advantages I have derived\r\nfrom communication with you, to accept and re-echo cordially your\r\nexpressions of good will, and to convey the fervent hope that no act or\r\nword of mine may ever tend to impair these sentiments in my own mind or\r\nyours.'\r\n\r\nWhen the others had withdrawn, Aberdeen told Mr. Gladstone that Lord\r\nJohn had been to call upon him the day before for the first time, and he\r\nbelieved that the visit had special reference to Mr. Gladstone himself.\r\n'The tenor of his conversation,' Mr. Gladstone reports, 'was that my\r\nopinions were quite as liberal as his; that in regard to the colonies I\r\nwent beyond him; that my Naples pamphlets could have been called\r\nrevolutionary if he had written them; and in regard to church matters he\r\nsaw no reason why there should not be joint action, for he was cordially\r\ndisposed to maintain the church of England, and so, he believed, was I.'\r\nLord John, however, we may be sure was the last man not to know how many\r\nanother element, besides agreement in opinion, decides relations of\r\nparty. Personal sympathies and antipathies, hosts of indirect affinities\r\nhaving apparently little to do with the main trunk of the school or the\r\nfaction, hosts of motives only half disclosed, or not disclosed at all\r\neven to him in whom they are at work--all these intrude in the\r\ncomposition and management of parties whether religious or political.\r\n\r\nGrave discussions turned on new nicknames. The tories had greatly gained\r\nby calling themselves conservatives after 1832. The name of whig had\r\nsome associations that were only less unpopular in the country than the\r\nname of tory. It was pointed out that many people would on no account\r\njoin the whigs, who yet would join a government of which Russells,\r\nGreys, Howards, Cavendishes, Villierses, were members. On the other hand\r\nGraham declared that Paley's maxim about religion was just as true in\r\npolitics--that men often change their creed, but not so often the name\r\nof their sect. And as to the suggestion, constantly made at all times in\r\nour politics for the benefit of waverers, of the name of\r\nliberal-conservative, Lord John caustically observed that whig has the\r\nconvenience of expressing in one syllable what liberal-conservative\r\nexpresses in seven, and whiggism in two syllables what conservative\r\nprogress expresses in six.\r\n\r\n                     MR. GLADSTONE AND HIS GROUP\r\n\r\nConnected with all this arose a geographical question--in what quarter\r\nof the House were the Peelites to sit? Hitherto the two wings of the\r\nbroken tory party, protectionist and Peelite, had sat together on the\r\nopposition benches. The change of administration in 1852 sent the\r\nprotectionists over to the Speaker's right, and brought the whigs to the\r\nnatural place of opposition on his left. The Peelite leaders therefore\r\nhad no other choice than to take their seats below the gangway, but on\r\nwhich side? Such a question is always graver than to the heedless\r\noutsider it may seem, and the Peelite discussions upon it were both\r\ncopious and vehement.[268] Graham at once resolved on sharing the front\r\nopposition bench with the whigs: he repeated that his own case was\r\ndifferent from the others, because he had once been a whig himself.\r\nHerbert, who acted pretty strictly with Mr. Gladstone all this year,\r\nargued that they only held aloof from the new ministers on one question,\r\nand therefore that they ought not to sit opposite to them as\r\nadversaries, but should sit below the gangway on the ministerial side.\r\nNewcastle intimated dissent from both, looking to the formation of his\r\nvirtuous and enlightened third party, but where they should sit in the\r\nmeantime he did not seem to know. Mr. Gladstone expressed from the first\r\na decided opinion in favour of going below the gangway on the opposition\r\nside. What they ought to desire was the promotion of a government\r\nconservative in its personal composition and traditions, as soon as the\r\ncrisis of protection should be over. Taking a seat, he said, is an\r\nexternal sign and pledge that ought to follow upon full conviction of\r\nthe thing it was understood to betoken; and to sit on the front\r\nopposition bench would indicate division from the conservative\r\ngovernment as a party, while in fact they were not divided from them as\r\na party, but only on a single question. In the end, Graham sat above the\r\nopposition gangway next to Lord John Russell and Cardwell. The Peelite\r\nbody as a whole determined on giving the new government what is called a\r\nfair trial. 'Mr. Sidney Herbert and I,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'took pains\r\nto bring them together, in the recognised modes. They sat on the\r\nopposition side, but below the gangway, full, or about forty strong; and\r\nSir James Graham, I recollect, once complimented me on the excellent\r\nappearance they had presented to him as he passed them in walking up the\r\nHouse.' Considerable uneasiness was felt among some of them at finding\r\nthemselves neighbours on the benches to Cobden and Bright and Hume and\r\ntheir friends on the one hand, and 'the Irish Brass Band' on the other.\r\n\r\nIt depended entirely on the Peelites whether the new government should\r\nbe permitted to conduct the business of the session (subject to\r\nconditions or otherwise), or whether they should be open to an instant\r\nattack as the enemies of free trade. The effect of such attack must have\r\nbeen defeat, followed by dissolution forthwith, and by the ejection of\r\nthe Derby government in June (as happened in 1859) instead of in\r\nDecember. The tactics of giving the ministers a fair trial prevailed and\r\nwere faithfully adhered to, Graham and Cardwell taking their own course.\r\nAs the result of this and other conditions, for ten months ministers,\r\ngreatly outnumbered, were maintained in power by the deliberate and\r\nunited action of about forty Peelites.\r\n\r\nLord Derby had opened his administration with a pledge, as the Peelites\r\nunderstood, to confine himself during the session to business already\r\nopen and advanced, or of an urgent character. When Mr. Disraeli gave\r\nnotice of a bill to dispose of four seats which were vacant, this was\r\nregarded by them as a manner of opening new and important issues, and\r\nnot within the definition that had been the condition of their\r\nprovisional support.[269] 'Lord John Russell came and said to me,' says\r\nMr. Gladstone, '\"What will you do?\" I admitted we were bound to act;\r\nand, joining the liberals, we threw over the proposal by a large\r\nmajority. This was the only occasion of conflict that arose; and it was\r\nprovoked, as we thought, by the government itself.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[256] 'He had told the Queen that he thought all the offices might be\r\nfilled in a respectable manner from among the members of the Peel\r\nadministration. On a subsequent day both Herbert and Cardwell made out\r\nfrom his conversation what I did not clearly catch, namely that Lord\r\nAberdeen himself would have acted on the Queen's wish, and that Graham\r\nhad either suggested the difficulty altogether, or at any rate got it\r\nput forward into its position.'

Stratford Canning, afterwards Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, was\r\ncousin of George Canning.\r\n\r\n[267] Graham spoke of himself as a tried reformer and as a member of the\r\nliberal party, and as glad to find himself the ally of so faithful a\r\nliberal and reformer as his fellow-candidate. He would not exactly\r\npledge himself to support the ballot, but he admitted it was a hard\r\nquestion, and said he was not so blind that practical experience might\r\nnot convince him that he was wrong. (Mar. 26, 1852.)\r\n\r\n[268] The same question greatly exercised Mr. Gladstone's mind in 1886,\r\nfor the same reason, that he again hoped for the reunion of a divided\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[269] This was a bill to assign the four disfranchised seats for Sudbury\r\nand St. Albans to the West Riding of Yorkshire and the southern division\r\nof Lancashire. Mr. Gladstone carried the order of the day by a majority\r\nof 86 against the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                         END OF PROTECTION\r\n\r\n                              (_1852_)\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to ask that now at least, after so much waste of\r\npublic time, after ministries overturned and parties disorganised,\r\nthe question of free trade should be placed high and dry on the\r\nshore whither the tide of political party strife could no longer\r\nreach it.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parliament was now dissolved (July 1) to decide a great question.\r\nThe repeal of the corn law, the ultimate equalisation of the sugar\r\nduties, the repeal of the navigation laws, had been the three great free\r\ntrade measures of the last half-dozen years, and the issue before the\r\nelectors in 1852 was whether this policy was sound or unsound. Lord\r\nDerby might have faced it boldly by announcing a moderate protection for\r\ncorn and for colonial sugar. Or he might have openly told the country\r\nthat he had changed his mind, as Peel had changed his mind about the\r\ncatholic question and about free trade, and as Mr. Disraeli was to\r\nchange his mind upon franchise in 1867, and Mr. Gladstone upon the Irish\r\nchurch in 1868. Instead of this, all was equivocation. The Derbyite, as\r\nwas well said, was protectionist in a county, neutral in a small town,\r\nfree trader in a large one. He was for Maynooth in Ireland, and against\r\nit in Scotland. Mr. Disraeli did his best to mystify the agricultural\r\nelector by phrases about set-offs and compensations and relief of\r\nburdens, 'seeming to loom in the future.' He rang the changes on\r\nmysterious new principles of taxation, but what they were to be, he did\r\nnot disclose. The great change since 1846 was that the working-class had\r\nbecome strenuous free traders. They had in earlier times never been\r\nreally convinced when Cobden and Bright assured them that no fall in\r\nwages would follow the promised fall in the price of food. It was the\r\nexperience of six years that convinced them. England alone had gone\r\nunhurt and unsinged through the fiery furnace of 1848, and nobody\r\ndoubted that the stability of her institutions and the unity of her\r\npeople were due to the repeal of bad laws, believed to raise the price\r\nof bread to the toilers in order to raise rents for territorial idlers.\r\n\r\n                      AGAIN ELECTED FOR OXFORD\r\n\r\nLong before the dissolution, it was certain that Mr. Gladstone would\r\nhave to fight for his seat. His letter to the Scotch bishop (see above,\r\np. 384), his vote for the Jews, his tenacity and vehemence in resisting\r\nthe bill against the pope,--the two last exhibitions in open defiance of\r\nsolemn resolutions of the university convocation itself,--had alienated\r\nsome friends and inflamed all his enemies. Half a score of the Heads\r\ninduced Dr. Marsham, the warden of Merton, to come out. In private\r\nqualities the warden was one of the most excellent of men, and the\r\naccident of his opposition to Mr. Gladstone is no reason why we should\r\nrecall transient electioneering railleries against a forgotten worthy.\r\nThe political addresses of his friends depict him. They applaud his\r\nsound and manly consistency of principle and his sober attachment to the\r\nreformed church of England, and they dwell with zest on the goodness of\r\nhis heart. The issue, as they put it, was simple: 'At a time when the\r\nstability of the protestant succession, the authority of a protestant\r\nQueen, and even the Christianity of the national character, have been\r\nrudely assailed by Rome on one side, and on the other by democratic\r\nassociations directed against the union of the Christian church with the\r\nBritish constitution--at such a time, it becomes a protestant\r\nuniversity, from which emanates a continuous stream of instruction on\r\nall ecclesiastical and Christian questions over the whole empire, to\r\nmanifest the importance which it attaches to protestant truth, by the\r\nselection of a _Protestant Representative_.' The teaching residents\r\nwere, as always, decisively for Gladstone, and nearly all the fellows of\r\nMerton voted against their own warden. In one respect this was\r\nremarkable, for Mr. Gladstone had in 1850 (July 18) resisted the\r\nproposal for that commission of inquiry into the universities which the\r\nOxford liberals had much at heart, and it would not have been\r\nsurprising if they had held aloof from a candidate who had told the\r\nHouse of Commons that 'after all, science was but a small part of the\r\nbusiness of education,'--a proposition that in one sense may be true,\r\nbut applied to unreformed Oxford was the reverse of true. The\r\nnon-residents were diligently and rather unscrupulously worked upon, and\r\nthey made a formidable set of discordant elements. The evangelicals\r\ndisliked Mr. Gladstone. The plain high-and-dry men distrusted him as\r\nwhat they called a sophist. Even some of the anglo-catholic men began to\r\nregard as a bad friend 'to the holy apostolic church of these realms,\r\nthe author of the new theory of religious liberty' in the Scotch letter.\r\nThey reproachfully insisted that had he headed a party in the House of\r\nCommons defending the church, not upon latitudinarian theories of\r\nreligious liberty, not upon vague hints of a disaffected movement of the\r\nnon-juring sort, still less upon romanising principles, but on the\r\nprinciples of the constitution, royal supremacy included, then the\r\nchurch would have escaped the worst that had befallen her since 1846.\r\nThe minister would never have dared to force Hampden into the seat of a\r\nbishop. The privy council would never have reversed the court of arches\r\nin the Gorham case. The claim of the clergy to meet in convocation would\r\nnever have been refused. The committee of council would have treated\r\neducation very differently.[270] All came right in the end, however, and\r\nMr. Gladstone was re-elected (July 14), receiving 260 votes fewer than\r\nSir Robert Inglis, but 350 more than the warden of Merton.[271] We have\r\nto remember that he was not returned as a liberal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the sections out of office, when the general election was\r\nover, at once fetched forth line and plummet to take their soundings.\r\n'The next few months,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Aberdeen (Aug. 20),\r\n'are, I apprehend, the crisis of _our_ fate, and will show whether we\r\nare equal or unequal to playing out with prudence, honour, and\r\nresolution _the drama or trilogy that has been on the stage since\r\n1841_.' He still regarded the situation as something like a reproduction\r\nof the position of the previous March. The precise number of the\r\nministerialists could not be ascertained until tested by a motion in the\r\nHouse. They had gained rather more than was expected, and some put them\r\nas high as 320, others as low as 290. What was undoubted was that Lord\r\nDerby was left in a minority, and that the support of the Peelites might\r\nany hour turn it into a majority. Notwithstanding a loss or two in the\r\nrecent elections, that party still numbered not far short of 40, and Mr.\r\nGladstone was naturally desirous of retaining it in connection with\r\nhimself. Most of the group were disposed rather to support a\r\nconservative government than not, unless such a government were to do,\r\nor propose, something open to strong and definite objection. At the same\r\ntime what he described as the difficulty of keeping Peelism for ever so\r\nshort a space upon its legs, was as obvious to him as to everybody else.\r\n'It will be an impossible parliament,' Graham said to Mr. Gladstone\r\n(July 15), 'parties will be found too nicely balanced to render a new\r\nline of policy practicable without a fresh appeal to the electors.'\r\nBefore a fresh appeal to the electors took place, the impossible\r\nparliament had tumbled into a great war.\r\n\r\n                         THE NEW PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the newly chosen members met in November, Mr. Disraeli told the\r\nHouse of Commons that 'there was no question in the minds of ministers\r\nwith respect to the result of that election: there was no doubt that\r\nthere was not only not a preponderating majority in favour of a change\r\nin the laws [free trade] passed in the last few years, or even of\r\nmodifying them in any degree; but that on the contrary there was a\r\ndecisive opinion on the part of the country that that settlement should\r\nnot be disturbed.' Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Aberdeen (July 30) that\r\nhe thought the government absolutely chained to Mr. Disraeli's next\r\nbudget, and 'I, for one, am not prepared to accept him as a financial\r\norgan, or to be responsible for what he may propose in his present\r\ncapacity.' Each successive speech made by Mr. Disraeli at Aylesbury he\r\nfound 'more quackish in its flavour than its predecessor.' Yet action on\r\nhis own part was unavoidably hampered by Oxford. 'Were I either of\r\nopinion,' he told Lord Aberdeen (Aug. 5), 'that Lord John Russell ought\r\nto succeed Lord Derby, or prepared without any further development of\r\nthe plans of the government to take my stand as one of the party opposed\r\nto them, the first step which, as a man of honour, I ought to adopt,\r\nshould be to resign my seat.' 'I do not mean hereby,' he adds in words\r\nthat were soon to derive forcible significance from the march of events,\r\n'that I am unconditionally committed against any alliance or fusion, but\r\nthat any such alliance or fusion, to be lawful for me, must grow out of\r\nsome failure of the government in carrying on public affairs, or a\r\ndisapproval of its measures when they shall have been proposed.' He\r\nstill, in spite of all the misdeeds of ministers during the elections,\r\ncould not think so ill of them as did Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n'Protection and religious liberty,' he wrote to Lord Aberdeen (Aug.\r\n5),'are the subjects on which my main complaints would turn; shuffling\r\nas to the former, trading on bigotry as to the latter. The shifting and\r\nshuffling that I complain of have been due partly to a miserably false\r\nposition and the giddy prominence of inferior men; partly to the (surely\r\nnot unexpected) unscrupulousness and second motives of Mr. Disraeli, at\r\nonce the necessity of Lord Derby and his curse. I do not mean that this\r\njustifies what has been said and done; I only think it brings the case\r\nwithin the common limits of political misconduct. As for religious\r\nbigotry,' he continues, 'I condemn the proceedings of the present\r\ngovernment; yet much less strongly than the unheard-of course pursued by\r\nLord John Russell in 1850-1, the person to whom I am now invited to\r\ntransfer my confidence.' Even on the superficial conversion of the\r\nDerbyites to free trade, Mr. Gladstone found a _tu quoque_ against the\r\nwhigs. 'It is, when strictly judged, an act of public immorality to form\r\nand lead an opposition on a certain plea, to succeed, and then in office\r\nto abandon it.... But in this view, the conduct of the present\r\nadministration is the counterpart and copy of that of the whigs\r\nthemselves in 1835, who ran Sir Robert Peel to ground upon the\r\nappropriation clause, worked it just while it suited them, and then cast\r\nit to the winds; to say nothing of their conduct on the Irish\r\nAssassination bill of 1846.'\r\n\r\nThis letter was forwarded by Aberdeen to Lord John Russell. Lord John\r\nhad the peculiar temperament that is hard to agitate, but easy to\r\nnettle. So polemical a reading of former whig pranks nettled him\r\nconsiderably. Why, he asked, should he not say just as reasonably that\r\nMr. Gladstone held up the whigs to odium in 1841 for stripping the\r\nfarmer of adequate protection; worked the corn law of 1842 as long as it\r\nsuited him; and then turned round and cast the corn law to the winds? If\r\nhe gave credit to Mr. Gladstone for being sincere in 1841, 1842, and\r\n1846, why should not Mr. Gladstone give the same credit to him? As to\r\nthe principle of appropriation, he and Althorp had opposed four of their\r\ncolleagues in the Grey cabinet; how could he concede to Peel what he had\r\nrefused to them? As for the Irish bill on which he had turned Peel out,\r\nit was one of the worst of all coercion bills; Peel with 117 followers\r\nevidently could not carry on the government; and what sense could there\r\nhave been in voting for a bad bill, in order to retain in office an\r\nimpossible ministry? This smart apologia of Lord John's was hardly even\r\nplausible, much less did it cover the ground. The charge against the\r\nwhigs is not that they took up appropriation, but that having taken it\r\nup they dropped it for the sake of office. Nor was it a charge that they\r\nresisted an Irish coercion bill, but that having supported it on the\r\nfirst reading ('worst of all coercion bills' as it was, even in the eyes\r\nof men who had passed the reckless act of 1833), they voted against it\r\nwhen they found that both Bentinck and the Manchester men were going to\r\ndo the same, thus enabling them to turn Peel out.\r\n\r\n                          CONFUSIONS OF PARTY\r\n\r\nSharp sallies into the past, however, did not ease the present. It was\r\nan extraordinary situation only to be described in negatives. A majority\r\ncould not be found to beat the government upon a vote of want of\r\nconfidence. Nobody knew who could take their places. Lord John Russell\r\nas head of a government was impossible, for his maladroit handling of\r\npapal aggression had alienated the Irish; his dealings with Palmerston\r\nhad offended one powerful section of the English whigs; the Scottish\r\nwhigs hated him as too much managed by the lights of the free church;\r\nand the radicals proscribed him as the chief of a patrician clique. Yet\r\nthough he was impossible, he sometimes used language to the effect that\r\nfor him to take any place save the first would be a personal degradation\r\nthat would lower him to the level of Sidmouth or Goderich. Lord\r\nPalmerston represented the moderate centre of the liberal party. Even\r\nnow he enjoyed a growing personal favour out of doors, not at all\r\nimpaired by the bad terms on which he was known to be with the court,\r\nfor the court was not at that date so popular an institution as it\r\nbecame by and by. Among other schemes of ingenious persons at this\r\nconfused and broken time was a combination under Palmerston or Lansdowne\r\nof aristocratic whigs, a great contingent of Derbyites, and the\r\nPeelites; and before the elections it was true that Lord Derby had made\r\novertures to these two eminent men. A Lansdowne combination lingered\r\nlong in the mind of Lord Palmerston himself, who wished for the\r\nrestoration of a whig government, but resented the idea of serving under\r\nits late head. Some dreamed that Palmerston and Disraeli might form a\r\ngovernment on the basis of resistance to parliamentary reform. Strange\r\nrumours were even afloat that Mr. Gladstone's communications with\r\nPalmerston before he left London at the election had been intimate and\r\nfrequent. 'I cannot make Gladstone out,' said Lord Malmesbury, 'he seems\r\nto me a dark horse.'\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of the autumn (September 12) Graham interpreted some\r\nobscure language of Mr. Gladstone's as meaning that if protection were\r\nrenounced, as it might be, if Palmerston joined Derby and the government\r\nwere reconstructed, and if Disraeli ceased to be leader, then his own\r\nrelations with the government would be changed. Gladstone was so uneasy\r\nin his present position, so nice in the equipoise of his opinions that\r\nhe wished to be, as he said, 'on the liberal side of the conservative\r\nparty, rather than on the conservative side of the liberal party.' A\r\nlittle earlier than this, Lord Aberdeen and Graham agreed in thinking\r\n(August) that 'Disraeli's leadership was the great cause of Gladstone's\r\nreluctance to have anything to do with the government; ... that even if\r\nthis should be removed, it would not be very easy for him to enter into\r\npartnership with them.' Mr. Gladstone himself now and always denied that\r\nthe lead in the Commons or other personal question had anything to do\r\nwith the balance of his opinions at the present and later moments. Those\r\nwho know most of public life are best aware how great is the need in the\r\ncase of public men for charitable construction of their motives and\r\nintent. Yet it would surely have been straining charity to the point of\r\ndishonour if, within two years of Peel's death, any of those who had\r\nbeen attached to him as master and as friend, either Mr. Gladstone or\r\nanybody else, could have looked without reprobation and aversion on the\r\nidea of cabinet intimacy with the bitterest and least sincere of all\r\nPeel's assailants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                           OPENING SKIRMISHES\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone repaired to London some weeks before the new session, and\r\nthough he was not in a position to open direct relations with the\r\ngovernment, he expressed to Lord Hardinge, with a view to its\r\ncommunication to Lord Derby, his strong opinion that the House of\r\nCommons would, and should, require from ministers a frank and explicit\r\nadoption of free trade through the address, and secondly, the immediate\r\nproduction of their financial measures. Lord Derby told Hardinge at\r\nWindsor that he thought that neither expectation was far wrong. When the\r\nPeelites met at Lord Aberdeen's to discuss tactics, they were secretly\r\ndissatisfied with the paragraphs about free trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli had laid down at the election the sonorous maxim, that no\r\nstatesman can disregard with impunity the genius of the epoch in which\r\nhe lives. And he now after the election averred that the genius of the\r\nage was in favour of free exchange. Still it was pleasanter to swallow\r\nthe dose with as little public observation as possible. 'What would have\r\nbeen said,' cried Lord Derby in fervid remonstrance, 'if shortly after\r\ncatholic emancipation and the reform bill had been admitted as\r\nsettlements, their friends had come down and insisted not only that the\r\nHouses of parliament should consent to act on the new policy they had\r\nadopted, but should expressly recant their opinion in favour of the\r\npolicy that had formerly prevailed? What would the friends of Sir R.\r\nPeel have said in 1835 if, when he assumed the government and when the\r\nnew parliament assembled, he had been called upon to declare that the\r\nreform bill was wise, just, and necessary?' The original free traders\r\nwere not disposed to connive at Derbyite operations any more than were\r\nthe whigs. Notice was at once given by Mr. Villiers of a motion\r\nvirtually assailing the ministers, by asserting the doctrine of free\r\ntrade in terms they could not adopt. 'Now,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'we came\r\nto a case in which the liberals did that which had been done by the\r\ngovernment in the case of the Four Seats bill; that is to say, they\r\nraised an issue which placed us against them. Lord Palmerston moved the\r\namendment which defeated the attack, but he did this at the express\r\nrequest of S. Herbert and mine, and we carried the amendment to him at\r\nhis house. He did not recommend any particular plan of action, and he\r\nwillingly acquiesced in and adopted ours.' He said he would convey it to\r\nDisraeli, 'with whom,' he said, 'I have had communications from time to\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\nIn the debate (Nov. 26) upon the two rival amendments--that of Mr.\r\nVilliers, which the ministers could not accept, and that of Palmerston,\r\nwhich they could--Sidney Herbert paid off some old scores in a speech\r\nfull of fire and jubilation; Mr. Gladstone, on the other hand, was\r\nelaborately pacific. He earnestly deprecated the language of severity\r\nand exasperation, or anything that would tend to embitter party warfare.\r\nHis illustrious leader Peel, he said, did indeed look for his revenge;\r\nbut for what revenge did he look? Assuredly not for stinging speeches,\r\nassuredly not for motions made in favour of his policy, if they carried\r\npain and degradation to the minds of honourable men. Were they not\r\ncelebrating the obsequies of an obnoxious policy? Let them cherish no\r\ndesire to trample on those who had fought manfully and been defeated\r\nfairly. Rather let them rejoice in the great public good that had been\r\nachieved; let them take courage from the attainment of that good, for\r\nthe performance of their public duty in future. All this was inspired by\r\nthe strong hope of conservative reunion. 'Nervous excitement kept me\r\nvery wakeful after speaking,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'the first time for\r\nmany years.' (_Diary._)\r\n\r\nVilliers's motion was rejected by 336 to 256, the Peelites and Graham\r\nvoting with ministers in the majority. The Peelite amendment in\r\nmoderated terms, for which Palmerston stood sponsor, was then carried\r\nagainst the radicals by 468 to 53. For the moment the government was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n     This evening, Mr. Gladstone writes on the next day, Nov. 27, I went\r\n     to Lady Derby's evening party, where Lord Derby took me a little\r\n     aside and said he must take the opportunity of thanking me for the\r\n     tone of my speech last night, which he thought tended to place the\r\n     discussion on its right footing. It was evident from his manner,\r\n     and Lady Derby's too, that they were highly pleased with the issue\r\n     of it. I simply made my acknowledgments in terms of the common\r\n     kind, upon which he went on to ask me what in my view was to happen\r\n     next? The great object, he said, was to get rid of all personal\r\n     questions, and to consider how all those men who were united in\r\n     their general views of government might combine together to carry\r\n     on with effect. For himself he felt both uncertain and indifferent;\r\n     he might be able to carry on the government or he might not; but\r\n     the question lay beyond that, by what combination or arrangement of\r\n     a satisfactory nature, in the event of his displacement, the\r\n     administration of public affairs could be conducted.\r\n\r\n     To this I replied, that it seemed to me that _our_ situation\r\n     (meaning that of Herbert, Goulburn, and others, with myself) in\r\n     relation to his government remained much as it was in March and\r\n     April last.... We have to expect your budget, and the production of\r\n     that is the next step. He replied that he much desired to see\r\n     whether there was a possibility of any _rapprochement_, and seemed\r\n     to glance at personal considerations as likely perhaps to stand in\r\n     the way [Disraeli, presumably]. I said in reply, that no doubt\r\n     there were many difficulties of a personal nature to be faced in\r\n     conceiving of any ministerial combination when we looked at the\r\n     present House of Commons: many men of power and eminence, but great\r\n     difficulties arising from various causes, present and past\r\n     relations, incompatibilities, peculiar defects of character, or\r\n     failure in bringing them into harmony. I said that, as to relations\r\n     of parties, circumstances were often stronger than the human will;\r\n     that we must wait for their guiding, and follow it.... He said,\r\n     rather decidedly, that he assented to the truth of this doctrine.\r\n     He added, 'I think Sidney said more last night than he intended,\r\n     did he not?' I answered, 'You mean as to one particular expression\r\n     or sentence?' He rejoined, 'Yes.'[272] I said, 'I have had no\r\n     conversation with him on it, but I think it very probable that he\r\n     grew warm and went beyond his intention at that point; at the same\r\n     time, I think I ought to observe to you that I am confident that\r\n     expression was occasioned by one particular preceding speech in the\r\n     debate.' He gave a significant assent, and seemed to express no\r\n     surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      IV\r\n\r\n                           MR. DISRAELI'S PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nThe respite for ministers was short. The long day of shadowy promises\r\nand delusive dreams was over; and the oracular expounder of mysteries\r\nwas at last gripped by the hard realities of the taxes. Whigs and\r\nPeelites, men who had been at the exchequer and men who hoped to be,\r\nwere all ready at last to stalk down their crafty quarry. Without delay\r\nDisraeli presented his budget (Dec. 3). As a private member in\r\nopposition he had brought forward many financial proposals, but it now\r\nturned out that none of them was fit for real use. With a serene\r\naudacity that accounts for some of Mr. Gladstone's repulsion, he told\r\nthe House that he had greater subjects to consider 'than the triumph of\r\nobsolete opinions.' His proposals dazzled for a day, and then were seen\r\nto be a scheme of illusory compensations and dislocated expedients. He\r\ntook off half of the malt-tax and half of the hop duty, and in stages\r\nreduced the tea duty from two shillings and twopence to one shilling.\r\nMore important, he broke up the old frame of the income-tax by a\r\nvariation of its rates, and as for the house-tax, he doubled its rate\r\nand extended its area. In one of his fragmentary notes, Mr. Gladstone\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     Having run away from protection, as it was plain from the first\r\n     they would do, they had little to offer the land, but that little\r\n     their minority was ready to accept. It was a measure essentially\r\n     bad to repeal half the malt duty. But the flagrantly vicious\r\n     element in Disraeli's budget was his proposal to reduce the\r\n     income-tax on schedule D. to fivepence in the pound, leaving the\r\n     other schedules at sevenpence. This was no compensation to the\r\n     land; but, inasmuch as to exempt one is to tax another, it was a\r\n     distinct addition to the burdens borne by the holders of visible\r\n     property. It was on Disraeli's part a most daring bid for the\r\n     support of the liberal majority, for we all knew quite well that\r\n     the current opinion of the whigs and liberals was in favour of this\r\n     scheme; which, on the other hand, was disapproved by sound\r\n     financiers. The authority of Pitt and Peel, and then my own study\r\n     of the subject, made me believe that it was impracticable, and\r\n     probably meant the disruption of the tax, with confusion in\r\n     finance, as an immediate sequitur. What angered me was that\r\n     Disraeli had never examined the question. And I afterwards found\r\n     that he had not even made known his intentions to the board of\r\n     inland revenue. The gravity of the question thus raised made me\r\n     feel that the day was come to eject the government.\r\n\r\n                          ATTACK ON THE BUDGET\r\n\r\nIt was upon the increase of the house-tax that the great battle was\r\nfinally staked. Mr. Gladstone's letters to his wife at Hawarden bring\r\nthe rapid and excited scenes vividly before us.\r\n\r\n     _6 Carlton Gardens, Dec. 3, 1852._--I write from H. of C. at 41/2\r\n     just expecting the budget. All seem to look for startling and\r\n     dangerous proposals. You will read them in the papers of to-morrow,\r\n     be they what they may. If there is anything outrageous, we may\r\n     protest at once; but I do not expect any extended debate\r\n     to-night.... The rush for places in the H. of C. is immense.\r\n\r\n     _Monday, Dec. 6._--On Saturday, in the early part of the day, I had\r\n     a return, perhaps caused by the damp relaxing weather, of the\r\n     neuralgic pain in my face, and in the afternoon a long sitting at\r\n     Lord Aberdeen's about the budget, during which strange to say my\r\n     pain disappeared, but which kept me past the ordinary post hour.\r\n     These were the causes of your having no letter. The said budget\r\n     will give rise to serious difficulties. It is plain enough that\r\n     when its author announced something looming in the distance, he did\r\n     not mean this plan but something more extensive. Even his reduced\r\n     scheme, however, includes fundamental faults of principle which it\r\n     is impossible to overlook or compound with. The first day of\r\n     serious debate on it will be Friday next, and a vote will be taken\r\n     either then or on Monday.\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 8._--Be sure to read Lord Derby's speech on Monday. His\r\n     reference to the cause of his quarrel with Lord George Bentinck was\r\n     most striking, and is interpreted as a rap at Disraeli.[273] I have\r\n     had a long sit with Lord Aberdeen to-day talking over\r\n     possibilities. The government, I believe, talk confidently about\r\n     the decision on the house-tax, but I should doubt whether they are\r\n     right. Meantime I am convinced that Disraeli's is the least\r\n     conservative budget I have ever known.\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 14._--I need hardly say the vision of going down to-morrow\r\n     has been dissolved. It has been arranged that I am not to speak\r\n     until the close of the debate; and it is considered almost certain\r\n     to go on till Monday. Ministers have become much less confident,\r\n     but I understand that some, I know not how many, of Lord John's men\r\n     are not to be relied on. Whether they win or not (I expect the\r\n     latter, but my opinion is _naught_) they cannot carry this\r\n     house-tax nor their budget. But the mischief of the proposals they\r\n     have launched will not die with them.\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 15._--I write in great haste. Though it is Wednesday, I have\r\n     been down at the House almost all day to unravel a device of\r\n     Disraeli's about the manner in which the question is to be put, by\r\n     which he means to catch votes; and _I think_ after full\r\n     consultation with Mahon and Wilson Patten, that this will be\r\n     accomplished. The debate may close to-morrow night. I am sorry to\r\n     say I have a long speech fermenting in me, and I feel as a loaf\r\n     might in the oven. The government, it is thought, are likely to be\r\n     beaten.\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 16._--I have been engaged in the House till close on post\r\n     time. Disraeli trying to wriggle out of the question, and get it\r\n     put upon words without meaning, to enable more to vote as they\r\n     please, _i.e._ his men or those favourably inclined to him. But he\r\n     is beaten in this point, and we have now the right question before\r\n     us. It is not now quite certain whether we shall divide to-night; I\r\n     hope we may, for it is weary work sitting with a speech fermenting\r\n     inside one.[274]\r\n\r\n     _Dec. 18._--I have never gone through so exciting a passage of\r\n     parliamentary life. The intense efforts which we made to obtain,\r\n     and the government to escape, a definite issue, were like a fox\r\n     chase, and prepared us all for excitement. I came home at seven,\r\n     dined, read for a quarter of an hour, and actually contrived (only\r\n     think) to sleep in the fur cloak for another quarter of an hour;\r\n     got back to the House at nine. Disraeli rose at 10.20 [Dec. 16],\r\n     and from that moment, of course, I was on tenterhooks, except when\r\n     his superlative acting and brilliant oratory from time to time\r\n     absorbed me and made me quite _forget_ that I had to follow him. He\r\n     spoke until one. His speech as a whole was grand; I think the most\r\n     powerful I ever heard from him. At the same time it was disgraced\r\n     by shameless personalities and otherwise; I had therefore to begin\r\n     by attacking him for these. There was a question whether it would\r\n     not be too late, but when I heard his personalities I felt there\r\n     was no choice but to go on. My great object was to show the\r\n     conservative party how their leader was hoodwinking and bewildering\r\n     them, and this I have the happiness of believing that in some\r\n     degree I effected; for while among some there was great heat and a\r\n     disposition to interrupt me when they could, I could _see_ in the\r\n     faces and demeanour of others quite other feelings expressed. But\r\n     it was a most difficult operation, and altogether it might have\r\n     been better effected. The House has not I think been so much\r\n     excited for years. The power of his speech, and the importance of\r\n     the issue, combined with the lateness of the hour, which always\r\n     operates, were the causes. My brain was strung very high, and has\r\n     not yet quite got back to calm, but I slept well last night. On\r\n     Thursday night [_i.e._ Friday morning] after two hours of sleep, I\r\n     awoke, and remembered a gross omission I had made, which worked\r\n     upon me so that I could not rest any more. And still, of course,\r\n     the time is an anxious one, and I wake with the consciousness of\r\n     it, but I am very well and really not unquiet. When I came home\r\n     from the House, I thought it would be good for me to be mortified.\r\n     Next morning I opened the _Times_, which I thought _you_ would buy,\r\n     and _was_ mortified when I saw it did not contain my speech but a\r\n     mangled abbreviation. Such is human nature, at least mine. But in\r\n     the _Times_ of to-day you will see a very curious article\r\n     descriptive of the last scene of the debate. It has evidently been\r\n     written by a man who must have seen what occurred, or been informed\r\n     by those who did see. He by no means says too much in praise of\r\n     Disraeli's speech. I am told he is much stung by what I said. I am\r\n     very sorry it fell to me to say it; God knows I have no wish to\r\n     give him pain; and really with my deep sense of his gifts I would\r\n     only pray they might be well used.\r\n\r\n                       THE TWO ANTAGONISTS\r\n\r\nThe writer in the _Times_ to whom the victorious orator here refers\r\ndescribes how, 'like two of Sir Walter Scott's champions, these\r\nredoubtable antagonists gathered up all their force for the final\r\nstruggle, and encountered each other in mid-career; how, rather equal\r\nthan like, each side viewed the struggle of their chosen athletes, as if\r\nto prognosticate from the war of words the fortunes of two parties so\r\nnicely balanced and marshalled in apparently equal array. Mr. Disraeli's\r\nspeech,' he says, 'was in every respect worthy of his oratorical\r\nreputation. The retorts were pointed and bitter, the hits telling, the\r\nsarcasm keen, the argument in many places cogent, in all ingenious, and\r\nin some convincing. The merits were counterbalanced by no less glaring\r\ndefects of tone, temper, and feeling. In some passages invective was\r\npushed to the limit of virulence, and in others, meant no doubt to\r\nrelieve them by contrast, the coarser stimulants to laughter were very\r\nfreely applied. Occasionally whole sentences were delivered with an\r\nartificial voice and a tone of studied and sardonic bitterness,\r\npeculiarly painful to the audience, and tending greatly to diminish the\r\neffect of this great intellectual and physical effort. The speech of Mr.\r\nGladstone was in marked contrast. It was characterised throughout by the\r\nmost earnest sincerity. It was pitched in a high tone of moral\r\nfeeling--now rising to indignation, now sinking to remonstrance--which\r\nwas sustained throughout without flagging and without effort. The\r\nlanguage was less ambitious, less studied, but more natural and flowing\r\nthan that of Mr. Disraeli; and though commencing in a tone of stern\r\nrebuke, it ended in words of almost pathetic expostulation.... That\r\npower of persuasion which seems entirely denied to his antagonist, Mr.\r\nGladstone possesses to great perfection, and to judge by the\r\ncountenances of his hearers, those powers were very successfully\r\nexerted. He had, besides, the immense advantage resulting from the tone\r\nof moral superiority which he assumed and successfully maintained, and\r\nwhich conciliated to him the goodwill of his audience in a degree never\r\nattained by the most brilliant sallies of his adversary, and when he\r\nconcluded the House might well feel proud of him and of themselves.'\r\n\r\nA violent thunderstorm raged during the debate, but the excited senators\r\nneither noticed the flashes of lightning nor heard a tremendous shock of\r\nthunder. A little before four o'clock in the morning (Dec. 17), the\r\ndivision was taken, and ministers were beaten by nineteen (305 to 286).\r\n'There was an immense crowd,' says Macaulay, 'a deafening cheer when\r\nHayter took the right hand of the row of tellers, and a still louder\r\ncheer when the numbers were read.'[275]\r\n\r\n                         DEFEAT OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nA small incident occurred a few nights later to show that it was indeed\r\nhigh time to abate the passions of these six years and more. A\r\npolitician of secondary rank had been accused of bribery at Derby, and a\r\nband of tory friends thought the moment opportune to give him a banquet\r\nat the Carlton. Mr. Gladstone in another room was harmlessly reading the\r\npaper. Presently in came the revellers, began to use insulting language,\r\nand finally vowed that he ought to be pitched headlong out of the window\r\ninto the Reform. Mr. Gladstone made some courteous reply, but as the\r\nreporter truly says, courtesy to gentry in this humour was the casting\r\nof pearls before swine. Eventually they ordered candles in another room,\r\nand left him to himself.[276] 'You will perhaps,' he wrote to his wife,\r\n'see an account of a row at the Carlton in which I have taken no harm.'\r\nThe affair indeed was trivial, but it illustrates a well-known and\r\nstriking reflection of Cornewall Lewis upon the assault perpetrated on\r\nSumner in the Senate at Washington by Brooks. 'That outrage,' he said,\r\n'is no proof of brutal manners or low morality in Americans; it is the\r\nfirst blow in a civil war.... If Peel had proposed a law not only\r\nreducing rents, but annihilating them, instead of being attacked by a\r\nman of words like Disraeli, he would have been attacked with physical\r\narguments by some man of blows.'[277]\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers the stroke given to protection was not tremendous,\r\nbut as the history of half a century has shown, it was adequate and\r\nsufficient, and Lord Derby at once resigned. He did not take his defeat\r\nwell. 'Strange to say,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to his wife, 'Lord Derby has\r\nbeen making a most petulant and intemperate speech in the House of Lords\r\non his resignation; such that Newcastle was obliged to rise after him\r\nand contradict the charge of combination; while nothing could be better\r\nin temper, feeling, and judgment than Disraeli's farewell.' Derby\r\nangrily divided the combination that had overthrown him into, first,\r\nvarious gradations of liberalism from 'high aristocratic and exclusive\r\nwhigs down to the extremest radical theorists'; second, Irish\r\nultramontanes; and lastly, a party of some thirty or thirty-five\r\ngentlemen 'of great personal worth, of great eminence and\r\nrespectability, possessing considerable official experience and a large\r\namount of talent--who once professed, and I believe do still profess,\r\nconservative opinions.'\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli, on the contrary, with infinite polish and grace asked\r\npardon for the flying words of debate, and drew easy forgiveness from\r\nthe member whom a few hours before he had mocked as 'a weird sibyl'; the\r\nother member whom he would not say he greatly respected, but whom he\r\ngreatly regarded; and the third member whom he bade learn that petulance\r\nis not sarcasm, and insolence is not invective. Lord John Russell\r\ncongratulated him on the ability and the gallantry with which he had\r\nconducted the struggle, and so the curtain fell. The result, as the\r\ngreat newspaper put it with journalistic freedom, was 'not merely the\r\nvictory of a battle, but of a war; not a reverse, but a conquest. The\r\nvanquished have no principles which they dare to assert, no leaders whom\r\nthey can venture to trust.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[270] Charles Wordsworth, _Letter to Mr. Gladstone_, 1852, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[271] Inglis, 1368; Gladstone, 1108; Marsham, 758.\r\n\r\n[272] I suppose this refers to a passage about Mr. Disraeli:--'For my\r\npart I acquit the chancellor of the exchequer, so far as his own\r\nconvictions are concerned, of the charge of having ever been a\r\nprotectionist. I never for one moment thought he believed in the least\r\ndegree in protection. I do not accuse him of having forgotten what he\r\nsaid or what he believed in those years. I only accuse him of having\r\nforgotten now what he then wished it to appear that he believed.' The\r\nsame speech contains a whimsical reason why the Jews make no converts,\r\nwhich the taste of our more democratic House would certainly not\r\ntolerate.\r\n\r\n[273] 'The only serious misunderstanding I ever had with my noble and\r\nlamented friend Lord George Bentinck, which I am happy to say was\r\nthoroughly removed before his untimely death--was upon a full and frank\r\nexpression of my opinion that nothing could be more unfitting nor more\r\nimpolitic than to load with terms of vituperation those from whom we are\r\ncompelled conscientiously to differ' (_Dec. 6_).\r\n\r\n[274] 'We had a preliminary debate to have the whole resolution put,\r\ninstead of the preamble only, which was ultimately agreed to, and placed\r\nthe question more fairly before the public, Disraeli making the\r\nextraordinary declaration that though the proposal was for doubling the\r\nhouse-tax, nobody was bound by that vote to do so. It was an attempt at\r\na shuffle in order to catch votes from his own people, and to a certain\r\nextent it succeeded.'--_Halifax Papers_, 1852.\r\n\r\n[275] Trevelyan, ii. p. 331.\r\n\r\n[276] _Times_, Dec. 23, 1852.\r\n\r\n[277] _Letters_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Book IV\r\n\r\n                              _1853-1859_\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                             THE COALITION\r\n\r\n                               (_1853_)\r\n\r\n     The materials necessary for a sound judgment of facts are not found\r\n     in the success or failure of undertakings; exact knowledge of the\r\n     situation that has provoked them forms no inconsiderable element of\r\n     history.--METTERNICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland was unconsciously on the eve of a violent break in the peace\r\nthat had been her fortunate lot for nearly forty years. To the situation\r\nthat preceded this signal event, a judicious reader may well give his\r\nattention. Some of the particulars may seem trivial. In countries\r\ngoverned by party, what those out of the actualities of the fray reckon\r\ntrivial often count for much, and in the life of a man destined to be a\r\nconspicuous party leader, to pass them by would be to leave out real\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment in providing the country with a tory government had\r\nfailed. That alliance between whig and Peelite which Lord John the year\r\nbefore had been unable to effect, had become imperative, and at least a\r\nsecond experiment was to be tried. The initial question was who should\r\nbe head of the new government. In August, Lord Aberdeen had written to\r\nMr. Gladstone in anticipation of the Derbyite defeat: 'If high character\r\nand ability only were required, _you_ would be the person; but I am\r\naware that for the present at least this would not be practicable.\r\nWhether it would be possible for Newcastle or me to undertake the\r\nconcern is more than I can say.' Other good reasons apart, it is easy\r\nto see that Mr. Gladstone's attitude in things ecclesiastical put him\r\nout of court, and though he had made a conspicuous mark not only, as\r\nLord Aberdeen said, by character and ability but by liberality of view\r\nespecially in the region of colonial reform, still he had as yet had no\r\ngood opportunity for showing an independent capacity for handling great\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nNot any less impossible was Lord John. Shortly before the occasion\r\narose, a whig intimate told him plainly that reconstruction on the basis\r\nof his old government was out of the question. 'Lord John's answer was a\r\nfrank acceptance of that opinion; and he was understood to say that the\r\ncomposition of the next government must be mainly from the ranks of the\r\nPeelites; he evidently looked forward to being a member of it, but not\r\nthe head. When various persons were named as possible heads, Lord\r\nAberdeen was distinctly approved, Graham was distinctly rejected,\r\nNewcastle was mentioned without any distinct opinion expressed. We\r\n[Aberdeen and Gladstone] were both alike at a loss to know whether Lord\r\nJohn had changed his mind, or had all along since his resignation been\r\nacting with this view. All his proceedings certainly seem to require an\r\nopposite construction, and to contemplate his own leadership.'[278]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston was determined not to serve again under a minister who\r\nhad with his own hand turned him out of office, and of whose unfitness\r\nfor the first post he was at the moment profoundly convinced. He told a\r\nPeelite friend that Lord John's love of popularity would always lead him\r\ninto scrapes, and that his way of suddenly announcing new policies\r\n(Durham letter and Edinburgh letter) without consulting colleagues,\r\ncould not be acquiesced in. Besides the hostility of Palmerston and his\r\nfriends, any government with the writer of the Durham letter at its head\r\nmust have the hostility of the Irishmen to encounter. The liberal\r\nattitude of the Peelites on the still smouldering question of papal\r\naggression gave Aberdeen a hold on the Irish such as nobody else could\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n                           A HARASSED WEEK\r\n\r\nAnother man of great eminence in the whig party might have taken the\r\nhelm, but Lord Lansdowne was seventy-two, and was supposed to have\r\nformally retired from office for ever. The leader of the Peelites\r\nvisited the patrician whig at Lansdowne House, and each begged the other\r\nto undertake the uncoveted post. Lord Aberdeen gave a slow assent.\r\nPreviously understanding from Lord John that he would join, Aberdeen\r\naccepted the Queen's commission to form a government. He had a harassed\r\nweek. At first the sun shone. 'Lord John consents,' wrote Mr. Gladstone\r\nto his wife at Hawarden, 'and has behaved very well. Palmerston refuses,\r\nwhich is a serious blow. To-morrow I think we shall get to detailed\r\narrangements, about which I do not expect extraordinary difficulty. But\r\nI suppose Palmerston is looking to become the leader of a Derby\r\nopposition; and without him, or rather with him between us and the\r\nconservatives, I cannot but say the game will be a very difficult one to\r\nplay. It is uncertain whether I shall be chancellor of the exchequer or\r\nsecretary for the colonies; one of the two I think certainly; and the\r\nexchequer will certainly come to Graham or me.'\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours angry squalls all but capsized the boat. Lord John at\r\nfirst had sought consolation in an orthodox historical parallel--the\r\ncase of Mr. Fox, though at the head of the largest party, leading the\r\nCommons under Lord Grenville as head of the government. Why should he,\r\nthen, refuse a position that Fox had accepted? But friends, often in his\r\ncase the most mischievous of advisers, reminded him what sort of place\r\nhe would hold in a cabinet in which the chief posts were filled by men\r\nnot of his own party. Lord John himself thought, from memories of Bishop\r\nHampden and other ecclesiastical proceedings, that Mr. Gladstone would\r\nbe his sharpest opponent. Then as the days passed, he found deposition\r\nfrom first place to second more bitter than he had expected. Historic\r\nand literary consolation can seldom be a sure sedative against the\r\nstings of political ambition. He changed his mind every twelve hours,\r\nand made infinite difficulties. When these were with much travail\r\nappeased, difficulties were made on behalf of others. The sacred caste\r\nand their adherents were up in arms, and a bitter cry arose that all\r\nthe good things were going to the Peelites, only the leavings to the\r\nwhigs. Lord John doubtless remembered what Fox had said when the\r\nministry of All the Talents was made,--'We are three in a bed.' Disraeli\r\nnow remarked sardonically, 'The cake is too small.' To realise the\r\nscramble, the reader may think of the venerable carp that date from\r\nHenry iv. and Sully, struggling for bread in the fish-ponds of the\r\npalace of Fontainebleau. The whigs of this time were men of intellectual\r\nrefinement; they had a genuine regard for good government, and a decent\r\nfaith in reform; but when we chide the selfishness of machine\r\npoliticians hunting office in modern democracy, let us console ourselves\r\nby recalling the rapacity of our oligarchies. 'It is melancholy,' muses\r\nSir James Graham this Christmas in his journal, 'to see how little\r\nfitness for office is regarded on all sides, and how much the public\r\nemployments are treated as booty to be divided among successful\r\ncombatants.'\r\n\r\nFrom that point of view, the whig case was strong. 'Of 330 members of\r\nthe House of Commons,' wrote Lord John to Aberdeen, '270 are whig and\r\nradical, thirty are Irish brigade, thirty are Peelites. To this party of\r\nthirty you propose to give seven seats in cabinet, to the whigs and\r\nradicals five, to Lord Palmerston one.' In the end there were six whigs,\r\nas many Peelites, and one radical. The case of four important offices\r\nout of the cabinet was just as heartrending: three were to go to the\r\nthirty Peelites, and one to the two hundred and seventy just persons. 'I\r\nam afraid,' cried Lord John, 'that the liberal party will never stand\r\nthis, and that the storm will overwhelm me.' Whig pride was deeply\r\nrevolted at subjection to a prime minister whom in their drawing-rooms\r\nthey mocked as an old tory. In the Aberdeen cabinet, says Mr. Gladstone,\r\n'it may be thought that the whigs, whose party was to supply five-sixths\r\nor seven-eighths of our supporters, had less than their due share of\r\npower. It should, however, be borne in mind that they had at this\r\njuncture in some degree the character of an used up, and so far a\r\ndiscredited, party. Without doubt they were sufferers from their\r\nill-conceived and mischievous Ecclesiastical Titles Act. Whereas we,\r\nthe Peelites had been for six and a half years out of office, and had\r\nupon us the gloss of freshness.'\r\n\r\n                     CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston refused to join the coalition, on the honourable ground\r\nthat for many years he and Aberdeen had stood at the antipodes to one\r\nanother in the momentous department of foreign affairs. In fact he\r\nlooked in another direction. If the Aberdeen-Russell coalition broke\r\ndown, either before they began the journey or very soon after, Lord\r\nDerby might come back with a reconstructed team, with Palmerston leading\r\nin the Commons a centre party that should include the Peelites. He was\r\nbelieved to have something of this kind in view when he consented to\r\nmove the amendment brought to him by Gladstone and Herbert in November,\r\nand he was bitterly disappointed at the new alliance of that eminent\r\npair with Lord John. With the tories he was on excellent terms. Pall\r\nMall was alive with tales of the anger and disgust of the Derbyites\r\nagainst Mr. Disraeli, who had caused them first to throw over their\r\nprinciples and then to lose their places. The county constituencies and\r\nmany conservative boroughs were truly reported to be sick of the man who\r\nhad promised marvels as 'looming in the future,' and then like a bad\r\njockey had brought the horse upon its knees. Speculative minds cannot\r\nbut be tempted to muse upon the difference that the supersession by Lord\r\nPalmerston of this extraordinary genius at that moment might have made,\r\nboth to the career of Disraeli himself, and to the nation of which he\r\none day became for a space the supreme ruler. Cobden and Bright let it\r\nbe understood that they were not candidates for office. 'Our day has not\r\ncome yet,' Bright said to Graham, and the representative of the radicals\r\nin the cabinet was Sir William Molesworth. In their newspaper the\r\nradicals wrote rather stiffly and jealously. In the end Lord Palmerston\r\nchanged his mind and joined.\r\n\r\nIt was three days before the post of the exchequer was filled. Mr.\r\nGladstone in his daily letter to Hawarden writes: 'At headquarters I\r\nunderstand they say, \"Mr. G. destroyed the budget, so he ought to make a\r\nnew one.\" However we are trying to press Graham into that service.' The\r\nnext day it was settled. From Osborne a letter had come to Lord\r\nAberdeen: 'The Queen hopes it may be possible to give the chancellorship\r\nof the exchequer to Mr. Gladstone, and to secure the continuance of Lord\r\nSt. Leonards as chancellor.'[279] Notwithstanding the royal wish, 'we\r\npressed it,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'on Graham, but he refused point\r\nblank.' Graham, as we know, was the best economist in the administration\r\nof Peel, and Mr. Gladstone's frequent references to him in later times\r\non points of pure finance show the value set upon his capacity in this\r\ndepartment. His constitutional dislike of high responsibility perhaps\r\nintervened. Mr. Gladstone himself would cheerfully have returned to the\r\ncolonial office, but the whigs suspected the excesses of his colonial\r\nliberalism, and felt sure that he would sow the tares of anglicanism in\r\nthese virgin fields. So before Christmas day came, Mr. Gladstone\r\naccepted what was soon in influence the second post in the\r\ngovernment,[280] and became chancellor of the exchequer.\r\n\r\nSay what they would, the parliamentary majority was unstable as water.\r\nHis own analysis of the House of Commons gave 270 British liberals, not\r\nvery compact, and the radical wing of them certain to make occasions of\r\ncombination against the government, especially in finance. The only\r\nother party avowing themselves general supporters of the government were\r\nthe forty Peelites--for at that figure he estimated them. The ministry,\r\ntherefore, were in a minority, and a portion even of that minority not\r\nalways to be depended on. The remainder of the House he divided into\r\nforty Irish brigaders, bent on mischief; from fifty to eighty\r\nconservatives, not likely to join in any factious vote, and not\r\nill-disposed to the government, but not to be counted on either for\r\nattendance or confidence; finally, the Derby opposition, from 200 to\r\n250, ready to follow Mr. Disraeli into any combination for turning out\r\nthe government. 'It thus appears, if we strike out the fifty\r\nconservatives faintly favourable, that we have a government with 310\r\nsupporters, liable on occasions, which frequently arise, to heavy\r\ndeductions; with an opposition of 290 (Derbyites and brigaders), most of\r\nthem ready to go all lengths. Such a government cannot be said to\r\npossess the confidence of the House of Commons in the full\r\nconstitutional sense.'\r\n\r\n                   EARLY POSITION OF THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\nThe general course seemed smooth. Palmerston had gone to the harmless\r\ndepartment of home affairs. The international airs were still. But a\r\ncabinet finally composed of six Peelites, six whigs, and a radical, was\r\nevidently open to countless internal hazards. 'We shall all look\r\nstrangely at each other,' one of them said, 'when we first meet in\r\ncabinet.' Graham describes them as a powerful team that would need good\r\ndriving. 'There are some odd tempers and queer ways among them; but on\r\nthe whole they are gentlemen, and they have a perfect gentleman at their\r\nhead, who is honest and direct, and who will not brook insincerity in\r\nothers.' The head of the new government described it to a friend as 'a\r\ngreat experiment, hitherto unattempted, and of which the success must be\r\nconsidered doubtful, but in the meantime the public had regarded it with\r\nsingular favour.' To the King of the Belgians, Aberdeen wrote: 'England\r\nwill occupy her true position in Europe as the constant advocate of\r\nmoderation and peace'; and to Guizot, that 'the position which we\r\ndesired so see England occupy among the nations of Europe, was to act\r\nthe part of a moderator, and by reconciling differences and removing\r\nmisunderstandings to preserve harmony and peace.'\r\n\r\nI have seen no more concise analysis of the early position of the\r\ncoalition government than that by one of the ablest and most experienced\r\nmembers of the whig party, not himself a candidate for office:--\r\n\r\n     'It is strong,' Sir Francis Baring wrote to his son, 'in personal\r\n     talent; none that I can remember stronger, though the head of the\r\n     government is untried. It is strong in one point of view: as to\r\n     public feeling. The country, I believe, wanted a moderate liberal\r\n     government, and a fusion of liberal conservatives and moderate\r\n     liberals. It is weak in the feelings of the component parts:\r\n     Palmerston is degraded, Gladstone will struggle for power, Lord\r\n     John cannot be comfortable. It is weak in the discordant\r\n     antecedents of the cabinet; they must all make some sacrifices and\r\n     work uncomfortably. It is weak in the support. I do not mean the\r\n     numbers, but the class of supporters. The Peelites are forty; they\r\n     will have the liberals on the one side and the conservatives on the\r\n     other. The whigs of the cabinet will be anxious to satisfy the\r\n     former; the Peelites (Gladstone especially) the other. They are\r\n     weak in their church views. The protestants look on those who voted\r\n     against the Aggression bill with distrust; the evangelicals on\r\n     Gladstone and S. Herbert with dislike. I don't pretend to be a\r\n     prophet, but it is always well to put down what you expect and to\r\n     compare these expectations with results. My conjecture is that\r\n     Gladstone will, before long, leave the government or that he will\r\n     break it up.'[281]\r\n\r\nLong afterwards Mr. Gladstone himself said this of the coalition:--\r\n\r\n     I must say of this cabinet of Lord Aberdeen's that in its\r\n     deliberations it never exhibited the marks of its dual origin. Sir\r\n     W. Molesworth, its radical member, seemed to be practically rather\r\n     nearer in colour to the Peelites than to the whigs. There were some\r\n     few idiosyncrasies without doubt. Lord Palmerston, who was home\r\n     secretary, had in him some tendencies which might have been\r\n     troublesome, but for a long time were not so. It is, for instance,\r\n     a complete error to suppose that he asked the cabinet to treat the\r\n     occupation of the Principalities as a _casus belli_. Lord Russell\r\n     shook the position of Lord Aberdeen by action most capricious and\r\n     unhappy. But with the general course of affairs this had no\r\n     connection; and even in the complex and tortuous movements of the\r\n     Eastern negotiations, the cabinet never fell into two camps. That\r\n     question and the war were fatal to it. In itself I hardly ever saw\r\n     a cabinet with greater promise of endurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                         OPPOSITION AT OXFORD\r\n\r\nAcceptance of office vacated the Oxford seat, and the day after\r\nChristmas a thunderbolt fell upon the new chancellor of the exchequer\r\nfrom his friend, the militant archdeacon of Taunton. 'I wish to use few\r\nwords,' Denison wrote, 'where every word I write is so bitterly\r\ndistressing to me, and must be little less so, I cannot doubt, to\r\nyourself and to many others whom I respect and love. I have to state to\r\nyou, as one of your constituents, that from this time I can place no\r\nconfidence in you as representative of the university of Oxford, or as a\r\npublic man.' Mr. Gladstone's protestations that church patronage would\r\nbe as safe in Lord Aberdeen's hands as in Lord Derby's; that his own\r\npast history dispensed with the necessity of producing other assurances\r\nof his own fidelity; that his assumption of office could not shake\r\nit--all these were vain in face of the staring and flagrant fact that he\r\nwould henceforth be the intimate and partner in council of Lord John\r\nRussell, the latitudinarian, the erastian, the appropriationist, the\r\ndespoiler; and worse still, of Molesworth, sometimes denounced as a\r\nSocinian, sometimes as editor of the atheist Hobbes, but in either case\r\nno fit person to dispense the church patronage of the duchy of\r\nLancaster. Only a degree less shocking was the thought of the power of\r\nfilling bishoprics and deaneries by a prime minister himself a\r\npresbyterian. No guarantee that the member for Oxford might have taken\r\nagainst aggression upon the church, or for the concession of her just\r\nclaims, was worth a feather when weighed against the mere act of a\r\ncoalition so deadly as this.\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward fact for Mr. Gladstone's canvassers that Lord Derby\r\nhad stated that his defeat was the result of a concert or combination\r\nbetween the Peelites and other political parties. Mr. Gladstone himself\r\nsaw no reason why this should cause much soreness among his Oxford\r\nsupporters. 'No doubt,' he said, 'they will remember that I avowed\r\nbefore and during the last election a wish to find the policy and\r\nmeasures of the government such as would justify me in giving them my\r\nsupport. That wish I sincerely entertained. But the main question was\r\nwhether the concert or combination alleged to have taken place for the\r\npurpose of ejecting Lord Derby's government from office was fact or\r\nfiction. I have not the slightest hesitation in stating to you that it\r\nis a fiction. Evidence for the only presumption in its favour was\r\nthis--that we voted against the budget of Mr. Disraeli in strict\r\nconformity with every principle of finance we had professed through our\r\npolitical lives and with the policy of former finance ministers from the\r\ntime of Mr. Pitt, against the \"new principles\" and \"new policies\" which\r\nMr. Disraeli declared at Aylesbury his intention to submit to the House\r\nof Commons--a pledge which I admit that he completely redeemed.'[282]\r\n\r\nAll this was true enough, but what people saw was that the first fruits\r\nof the victory were a coalition with the whigs, who by voting with\r\nVilliers had from the first shown their predetermination against\r\nministers. As Northcote humorously said, Mary Stuart could never get\r\nover the presumption which her marriage with Bothwell immediately raised\r\nas to the nature of her previous connection with him. It is hard to deny\r\nthat, as the world goes, the Oxford tories clerical and lay might think\r\nthey had a case. Lord Derby was the tory minister, and Mr. Gladstone had\r\nbeen a chief instrument in turning him out. That was the one salient\r\nfact, and the political flock is often apt to see a thing with a more\r\nsingle eye than their shepherds.\r\n\r\nA candidate was found in Mr. Perceval, son of the tory prime minister\r\nwho had met a tragic death forty years before. The country clergy were\r\nplied with instigations and solicitations, public and private. No\r\nabsurdity was too monstrous to set afloat. Mr. Gladstone had seceded to\r\nthe episcopal church of Scotland. He had long ceased to be a\r\ncommunicant. He was on close and intimate terms with Cardinal Wiseman.\r\nHe had incited the pope to persecute protestants at Florence. In this\r\nvein a flight of angry articles and circulars descended on every\r\nparsonage where there was an Oxford master of arts with his name still\r\non the university books. At the beginning the enemy by a rush were in a\r\nmajority, but they were speedily beaten out of it. At the end of six\r\ndays, in spite of frenzied efforts, no more than 1330 votes out of a\r\nconstituency of 3600 had been recorded. Still the indomitable men\r\ninsisted on the legal right of keeping the poll open for fifteen days,\r\nand learned persons even gloomily hinted that the time might be extended\r\nto forty days. In the end (Jan. 20) Mr. Gladstone had 1022 votes against\r\nPerceval's 898, or a narrow majority of 124. The tory press justly\r\nconsoled themselves by calculating that such a majority was only six per\r\ncent. of the votes polled, but they were very angry with the failure of\r\nthe protestant electors in doing their patriotic duty against 'the\r\npro-romanist candidate.' The organ of the Peelites, on the other hand,\r\nwas delighted at the first verdict thus gained from the most influential\r\nconstituency in Great Britain, in favour of the new experiment of\r\nconservative-liberalism and wise and rational progress. Graham said, and\r\ntruly, that 'though Gladstone's defeat at that precise juncture would\r\nhave been a misfortune, yet for his own sake hereafter, emancipation\r\nfrom the thraldom of that constituency would be a blessing. It is a\r\nmillstone under which even Peel would have sunk.'\r\n\r\nWas Mr. Gladstone right in his early notion of himself as a slow moving\r\nmind? Would it be true to say that, compared with Pitt, for instance, he\r\nripened slowly? Or can we accurately describe him as having in any\r\ndepartment of life, thought, knowledge, feeling, been precocious?\r\nPerhaps not. To speak of slowness in a man of such magical rapidity of\r\nintellectual apprehension would be indeed a paradox, but we have seen\r\nalready how when he is walking in the middle path of his years, there is\r\na sense in which he was slow in character and motion. Slowness explains\r\nsome qualities in his literary and oratorical form, which was often, and\r\nespecially up to our present period, vague, ambiguous, and obscure. The\r\ncareless and the uncharitable set all down to sophistry. Better\r\nobservers perceived that his seeming mystifications were in fact the\r\nresult of a really embarrassed judgment. They pointed out that where the\r\nway was clear, as in free trade, colonial government, dissenters'\r\nchapels, Jewish disabilities, catholic bishoprics, nobody could run more\r\nstraight, at higher speed, or with more powerful stride. They began to\r\nsay that in spite of Russells, Palmerstons, Grahams, Mr. Gladstone,\r\nafter all, was the least unlikely of them 'to turn out a thoroughgoing\r\nman of the people.' These anticipations of democracy there is no sign\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone himself, in the smallest degree, shared. The\r\nnewspapers, meanwhile, were all but unanimous in declaring that 'if\r\nexperience, talent, industry, and virtue, are the attributes required\r\nfor the government of this empire,' then the coalition government would\r\nbe one of the best that England had ever seen.\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's dislike and distrust of the intrusion not only of the\r\nrude secular arm, but of anything temporal into the sphere of spiritual\r\nthings, had been marked enough in the old days of battle at Oxford\r\nbetween the tractarians and the heads, though it was less manifest in\r\nthe Gorham case. In 1853 he found occasion for an honourable exhibition\r\nof the same strong feeling. Maurice had got into trouble with the\r\nauthorities at King's College by essays in which he was taken to hold\r\nthat the eternity of the future torment of the wicked is a superstition\r\nnot warranted by the Thirty-nine Articles. A movement followed in the\r\ncouncil of the college to oust Maurice from his professorial chair. Mr.\r\nGladstone took great pains to avert the stroke, and here is the story as\r\nhe told it to his brother-in-law, Lord Lyttelton:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To Lord Lyttelton._\r\n\r\n     _Oct. 29, 1853._--I remained in town last Thursday in order to\r\n     attend the council of K.C., and as far as I could, to see fair\r\n     play. I was afraid of a very precipitous proceeding, and I regret\r\n     to say my fears have been verified. The motion carried was the\r\n     Bishop of London's, but I am bound to say he was quite willing to\r\n     have waived it for another course, and the proceeding is due to a\r\n     body of laymen chiefly lords. The motion carried is to the effect\r\n     that the statements on certain points contained in Maurice's last\r\n     essay are of a dangerous character, and that his connection with\r\n     the theology of the school ought not to continue. I moved as an\r\n     amendment that the bishop be requested to appoint competent\r\n     theologians who should personally examine how far the statements\r\n     of Mr. Maurice were conformable to or at variance with the three\r\n     creeds and the formularies of the church of England, and should\r\n     make a report upon them, and that the bishop should be requested to\r\n     communicate with the council. For myself I find in different parts\r\n     of what Maurice has written things that I cannot, and I am quite\r\n     certain the council had not been able to, reconcile. This\r\n     consideration alone seemed to me to show that they were not in a\r\n     condition to proceed with a definite judgment. I do not feel\r\n     sufficiently certain what his view as a whole may be, even if I\r\n     were otherwise competent to judge whether it is within or beyond\r\n     the latitude allowed by the church in this matter. And\r\n     independently of all this I thought that even decency demanded of\r\n     the council, acting perforce in a judicial capacity, that they\r\n     should let the accused person know in the most distinct terms for\r\n     _what_ he was dismissed, and should show that they had dismissed\r\n     him, if at all, only after using greater pains to ascertain that\r\n     his opinions were in real contrariety to some article of the faith.\r\n     I also cherished the hope, founded on certain parts of what he has\r\n     said, that his friends might be able in the meantime to arrange\r\n     some _formula concordiae_ which might avert the scandal and mischief\r\n     of the dismissal. Sir J. Patteson, Sir B. Brodie, and Mr. Green\r\n     supported the amendment, but the majority went the other way, and\r\n     much was I grieved at it. I am not inclined to abate the dogmatic\r\n     profession of the church--on the contrary, nothing would induce me\r\n     to surrender the smallest fraction of it; but while jealous of its\r\n     infraction in any particular, I am not less jealous of the\r\n     obtrusion of any private or local opinion into the region of dogma;\r\n     and above all I hold that there should be as much rigour in a trial\r\n     of this kind, irrespective of the high character and distinguished\r\n     powers of the person charged in this particular case, as if he were\r\n     indicted for murder.[283]\r\n\r\n                           DEFENCE OF MAURICE\r\n\r\nLong afterwards, when the alleged heretic was dead, Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\nof him to Mr. Macmillan (April 11, 1884): 'Maurice is indeed a spiritual\r\nsplendour, to borrow the phrase of Dante about St. Dominic. His\r\nintellectual constitution had long been, and still is, to me a good\r\ndeal of an enigma. When I remember what is said and thought of him, and\r\nby whom, I feel that this must be greatly my own fault.' Some years\r\nafter the affair at King's College, Maurice was appointed to Vere\r\nStreet, and the attack upon him was renewed. Mr. Gladstone was one of\r\nthose who signed an address of recognition and congratulation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[278] Memo, by Mr. Gladstone of a conversation with Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n[279] The practical impossibility of retaining this learned man, the\r\nDerbyite chancellor, upon the coalition woolsack, is an illustration of\r\nthe tenacity of the modern party system.\r\n\r\n[280] It was not until the rise of Mr. Gladstone that a chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer, not being prime minister, stood at this high level.\r\n\r\n[281] From the Baring papers, for which I am indebted to the kindness of\r\nLord Northbrook.\r\n\r\n[282] _Times_, December 23, 1852.\r\n\r\n[283] See _Life of Maurice_, ii. p. 195; _Life of Wilberforce_, ii. pp.\r\n208-218.

He stayed at Christ Church with Dr. Jacobson, of whom it was\r\nobserved that he always looked as if on the point of saying something\r\nextremely piercing and shrewd, only it never came. He paid many calls,\r\ndined at Oriel, had a luncheon and made a speech in the hall at Balliol;\r\npassed busy days and brisk evenings, and filled up whatever spare\r\nmoments he could find or manufacture, with treasury papers, books on\r\ntaxation, consolidated annuities, and public accounts, alternating with\r\ndips into Lamennais--the bold and passionate French mystic, fallen angel\r\nof his church, most moving of all the spiritual tragedies of that day of\r\nheroic idealists.\r\n\r\nOn February 3 he moved into the house of the chancellor of the exchequer\r\nin that best known of all streets which is not a street, where he was\r\ndestined to pass some two and twenty of the forty-one years of the\r\npublic life that lay before him. He had a correspondence with Mr.\r\nDisraeli, his predecessor, on the valuation of the furniture in the\r\nofficial house. There was question, also, of the robe that passes down\r\nunder some law of exchange from one chancellor to another on an\r\napparently unsettled footing. The tone on this high concern was not\r\nwholly amicable. Mr. Gladstone notes especially in his diary that he\r\nwrote a draft of one of his letters on a Sunday, as being, I suppose,\r\nthe day most favourable to self-control; while Mr. Disraeli at last\r\nsuggests that Mr. Gladstone should really consult Sir Charles Wood, 'who\r\nis at least a man of the world.' Such are the angers of celestial minds.\r\n\r\nAt an early cabinet (Feb. 5) he began the battle that lasted in various\r\nshapes all the rest of his life. It was on a question of reducing the\r\nforce in the Pacific. 'Lord Aberdeen, Granville, Molesworth, and I were\r\nfor it. We failed.' What was the case for this particular retrenchment I\r\ndo not know, nor does it matter. Fiercer engagements, and many of them,\r\nwere to follow. Meanwhile he bent all the energies of his mind to the\r\nother front of financial questions--to raising money rather than\r\nexpending it, and with unwearied industry applied himself to solve the\r\nproblem of redistributing the burdens and improving the machinery of\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nFor many years circumstances had given to finance a lively and\r\ncommanding place in popular interest. The protracted discussion on the\r\ncorn law, conducted not only in senate and cabinet, but in country\r\nmarket-places and thronged exchanges, in the farmer's ordinary and at\r\nhuge gatherings in all the large towns in the kingdom, had agitated\r\nevery class in the community. The battle between free trade and\r\nprotection, ending in a revolution of our commercial system, had\r\nawakened men to the enormous truth, as to which they are always so soon\r\nready to relapse into slumber, that budgets are not merely affairs of\r\narithmetic, but in a thousand ways go to the root of the prosperity of\r\nindividuals, the relations of classes, and the strength of kingdoms. The\r\nfinance of the whigs in the years after the Reform bill had not only\r\nbewildered parliament, but had filled merchants, bankers, shipowners,\r\nmanufacturers, shopkeepers, and the whole array of general taxpayers\r\nwith perplexity and dismay. Peel recovered a financial equilibrium and\r\nrestored public confidence, but Peel was gone. The whigs who followed\r\nhim after 1846 had once more laboured under an unlucky star in this\r\nvital sphere of national affairs. They performed the unexampled feat of\r\nbringing forward four budgets in a single year, the first of them\r\nintroduced by Lord John Russell himself as prime minister. By 1851\r\nfloundering had reached a climax. Finance had thus discredited one\r\nhistorical party; it had broken up the other. It was finance that\r\noverthrew weak governments and hindered the possibility of a strong one.\r\n\r\n                           FISCAL CONFUSION\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli, the most unsparing of all the assailants of Peel, tried\r\nhis own hand in 1852. To have the genius and the patience of a great\r\npartisan chief is one gift, and this he had; to grasp the complex\r\nmaterial interests of a vast diversified society like the United Kingdom\r\ndemands powers of a different order. The defeat of Mr. Disraeli's budget\r\nat the end of 1852 seemed to complete the circle of fiscal confusion.\r\nEvery source of public income was the object of assault. Every indirect\r\ntax was to be reduced or swept away, and yet no two men appeared to\r\nagree upon the principles of the direct taxes that were to take their\r\nplace. The window duty, the paper duty, the tax on advertisements, the\r\nmalt-tax, the stamp on marine insurances, were all to vanish, but even\r\nthe most zealous reformers were powerless to fill the void. The\r\norder-book of the House of Commons was loaded with motions about the\r\nincome-tax, and an important committee sat in 1851 to consider all the\r\nquestions connected with the possibility of its readjustment and\r\namendment. They could not even frame a report. The belief that it was\r\nessentially unjust to impose the tax at one and the same rate upon\r\npermanent and temporary incomes, prevailed in the great mass, especially\r\nof the liberal party. Discussions arose all through this period,\r\ndescending not only to the elementary principles of taxation, but, as\r\nMr. Gladstone said, almost to the first principles of civilised society\r\nitself. Party distraction, ministerial embarrassment, adjournment after\r\nadjournment of a decision upon fundamental maxims of national\r\ntaxation--such was the bewildered scene. At last a statesman appeared,\r\na financier almost by accident (for, as we have seen, it was by no\r\nspecial choice of his own that Mr. Gladstone went to the exchequer), but\r\na financier endowed with a practical imagination of the highest class,\r\nwith a combination of the spirit of vigorous analysis and the spirit of\r\nvigorous system, with the habit of unflagging toil, and above all, with\r\nthe gift of indomitable courage. If anybody suggested the reappointment\r\nof Hume's committee, the idea was wisely dismissed. It was evidently, as\r\nGraham said, the duty of the executive government to lead the way and to\r\nguide public opinion in a matter of this crucial importance. It seemed\r\nimpossible and unworthy to avoid a frank declaration about the\r\nincome-tax. He was strongly of opinion (March 15) that a larger measure\r\nwould be carried with greater certainty and ease than simple renewal;\r\nand that a combination of income-tax, gradually diminishing to a fixed\r\nterm of extinction, with reduction of the interest of debt, and a review\r\nof the probate and legacy duties, afforded the best ground for a\r\nfinancial arrangement both successful and creditable. It was strong\r\nideas of this kind that encouraged Mr. Gladstone to build on a broad\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of his proceedings he set out in one of the most interesting\r\nof his political memoranda:--\r\n\r\n     The liberals were, to all appearance, pledged to the reconstruction\r\n     of the tax by their opinions, and the tories by their party\r\n     following. The small fraction of Peelites could probably be relied\r\n     upon the other way, and some few individuals with financial\r\n     knowledge and experience. The mission of the new government was\r\n     described by Lord Aberdeen in the House of Lords as a financial\r\n     mission, and the stress of it thus lay upon a person, very\r\n     ill-prepared. My opinions were with Peel; but under such\r\n     circumstances it was my duty to make a close and searching\r\n     investigation into the whole nature of the tax, and make up my mind\r\n     whether there was any means of accepting or compounding with the\r\n     existing state of opinion. I went to work, and laboured very hard.\r\n     When I had entered gravely upon my financial studies, I one day had\r\n     occasion--I know not what--to go into the city and to call upon\r\n     Mr. Samuel Gurney, to whom experience and character had given a\r\n     high position there. He asked me with interest about my\r\n     preparations for my budget; and he said, 'One thing I will venture\r\n     to urge, whatever your plan is,--let it be simple.' I was a man\r\n     much disposed to defer to authority, and I attached weight to this\r\n     advice. But as I went further and further into my subject, I became\r\n     more and more convinced that, as an honest steward, I had no option\r\n     but to propose the renewal of the tax in its uniform shape. I\r\n     constructed much elaborate argument in support of my proposition,\r\n     which I knew it would be difficult to answer. But I also knew that\r\n     no amount of unassisted argument would suffice to overcome the\r\n     obstacles in my way, and that this could only be done by large\r\n     compensations in my accompanying propositions. So I was led\r\n     legitimately on, and on, until I had framed the most complicated\r\n     scheme ever submitted to parliament.\r\n\r\n                          THE FABRIC PLANNED\r\n\r\nTruly has it been said that there is something repulsive to human nature\r\nin the simple reproduction of defunct budgets. Certainly if anything can\r\nbe more odious than a living tax, it is a dead one. It is as much as is\r\nconsonant to biography to give an outline of the plan that was gradually\r\nwrought out in Mr. Gladstone's mind during the first three laborious\r\nmonths of 1853, and to mark the extraordinarily far-reaching and\r\ncomprehensive character of the earliest of his thirteen budgets. Its\r\ninitial boldness lay in the adoption of the unusual course of estimating\r\nthe national income roughly for a long period of seven years, and\r\nassuming that expenditure would remain tolerably steady for the whole of\r\nthat period. Just as no provident man in private life settles his\r\nestablishment on the basis of one year or two years only, so Mr.\r\nGladstone abandoned hand-to-mouth, and took long views. 'I ought, no\r\ndoubt,' he said afterwards, 'to have pointed out explicitly that a great\r\ndisturbance and increase of our expenditure would baffle my reckonings.'\r\nMeanwhile, the fabric was planned on strong foundations and admirable\r\nlines. The simplification of the tariff of duties of customs, begun by\r\nPeel eleven years before, was carried forward almost to completion.\r\nNearly one hundred and forty duties were extinguished, and nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty were lowered. The tea duty was to be reduced in stages\r\nextending over three years from over two shillings to one shilling. In\r\nthe department of excise, the high and injurious duty on soap, which\r\nbrought into the exchequer over eleven hundred thousand pounds annually,\r\nwas swept entirely away. In the same department, by raising the duties\r\non spirits manufactured in Ireland nearer to the level of England and\r\nScotland, a step was taken towards identity of taxation in the three\r\nkingdoms--by no means an unequivocal good. Miscellaneous provisions and\r\nminor aspects of the scheme need not detain us; but a great reform of\r\nrate and scale in the system of the assessed taxes, the reduction of the\r\nduty on the beneficent practice of life insurance from half-a-crown to\r\nsixpence on the hundred pounds, and the substitution of a uniform\r\nreceipt stamp, were no contemptible contributions to the comfort and\r\nwell-being of the community. Advertisements in newspapers became free of\r\nduty.[284]\r\n\r\n                       KEYSTONE OF THE BUDGET\r\n\r\nThe keystone of the budget in Mr. Gladstone's conception was the\r\nposition to be assigned in it to the income-tax. This he determined to\r\nrenew for a period of seven years,--for two years at sevenpence in the\r\npound, for two years more at sixpence, and for the last three at\r\nfivepence. By that time he hoped that parliament would be able to\r\ndispense with it. Meanwhile it was to be extended to Ireland, in\r\ncompensation for the remission of a debt owed by Ireland to the British\r\ntreasury of between four and five millions. It was to be extended, also,\r\nat a reduced rate of fivepence, to incomes between a hundred and fifty\r\nand a hundred pounds--the former having hitherto been the line of total\r\nexemption. From the retention of the income-tax as a portion of the\r\npermanent and ordinary finance of the country the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer was wholly and strongly averse, and so he remained for more\r\nthan twenty years to come. In order, however, to meet a common and a\r\njust objection, that under this impost intelligence, enterprise, and\r\nskill paid too much and property paid too little, he resolved upon a\r\nbold step. He proposed that the legacy duty, hitherto confined to\r\npersonal property passing on death, either by will or by inheritance and\r\nnot by settlement, should henceforth be extended to real property, and\r\nto both descriptions of property passing by settlement, whether real or\r\npersonal. In a word, the legacy duty was to extend to all successions\r\nwhatever. This was the proposal that in many senses cut deepest. It was\r\nthe first rudimentary breach in the ramparts of the territorial system,\r\nunless, indeed, we count as first the abolition of the corn law.[285]\r\nMr. Gladstone eagerly disclaimed any intention of accelerating by the\r\npressure of fiscal enactment changes in the tenure of landed property,\r\nand the letters which the reader has already seen (pp. 345-9) show the\r\nhigh social value that he invariably set upon the maintenance of the old\r\nlanded order. The succession duty, as we shall find, for the time\r\ndisappointed his expectations, for he counted on two millions, and in\r\nfact it yielded little more than half of one. But it secured for its\r\nauthor the lasting resentment of a powerful class.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scheme that Mr. Gladstone now worked out in many weeks of\r\ntoil that would have been slavish, were it not that toil is never\r\nslavish when illuminated by a strenuous purpose. When by and by the\r\nresult had made him the hero of a glorious hour, he wrote to Lord\r\nAberdeen (April 19): 'I had the deepest anxiety with regard to you, as\r\nour chief, lest by faults of my own I should aggravate the cares and\r\ndifficulties into which I had at least helped to bring you; and the\r\nnovelty of our political relations with many of our colleagues, together\r\nwith the fact that I had been myself slow, and even reluctant, to the\r\nformation of a new connection, filled me with an almost feverish desire\r\nto do no injustice to that connection now that it was formed; and to\r\nredeem the pledge you generously gave on my behalf, that there would be\r\nno want of cordiality and zeal in the discharge of any duties which it\r\nmight fall to me to perform on behalf of such a government as was then\r\nin your contemplation.'\r\n\r\nThirteen, fourteen, fifteen hours a day he toiled at his desk. Treasury\r\nofficials and trade experts, soap deputations and post-horse\r\ndeputations, representatives of tobacco and representatives of the West\r\nIndia interest, flocked to Downing Street day by day all through March.\r\nIf he went into the city to dine with the Lord Mayor, the lamentable\r\nhole thus made in his evening was repaired by working till four in the\r\nmorning upon customs reform, Australian mints, budget plans of all\r\nkinds. It is characteristic that even this mountain load of concentrated\r\nand exacting labour did not prevent him from giving a Latin lesson every\r\nday to his second boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n'Some days before the day appointed for my statement,' says Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'I recited the leading particulars to my able and intelligent\r\nfriend Cardwell, not in the cabinet but then holding office as president\r\nof the board of trade. He was so bewildered and astounded at the bigness\r\nof the scheme, that I began to ask myself, Have I a right to ask my\r\ncolleagues to follow me amidst all these rocks and shoals? In\r\nconsequence I performed a drastic operation upon the plan, and next day\r\nI carried to Lord Aberdeen a reduced and mutilated scheme which might be\r\ndeemed by some politicians to be weaker but safer. I put to Lord\r\nAberdeen the question I had put to myself, and stated my readiness, if\r\nhe should think it called for, to make this sacrifice to the probable\r\ninclinations of my colleagues. But he boldly and wisely said, \"I take it\r\nupon myself to ask you to bring your original and whole plan before the\r\ncabinet.\" I thought this an ample warrant.'\r\n\r\n                        THE BUDGET IN CABINET\r\n\r\nAt last, after Mr. Gladstone had spent an hour at the palace in\r\nexplaining his scheme to the Prince Consort, the budget was opened to\r\nthe cabinet (April 9) in a speech of three hours--an achievement, I\r\nshould suppose, unparalleled in that line, for a cabinet consists of men\r\neach with pretty absorbing pre-occupations of his own. The exposition\r\nwas 'as ingenious,' Lord Aberdeen told Prince Albert, 'as clear, and for\r\nthe most part as convincing, as anything I have ever heard.'\r\n'Gladstone,' said Lord Aberdeen later (1856) 'does not weigh well\r\nagainst one another different arguments, each of which has a real\r\nfoundation. But he is unrivalled in his power of proving that a specious\r\nargument has no real foundation. On the Succession bill the whole\r\ncabinet was against him. He delivered to us much the same speech as he\r\nmade in the House of Commons. At its close we were all convinced.'[286]\r\n\r\nDifferences that might easily become serious speedily arose upon details\r\nin the minds of two or three of them, and for some days the prime\r\nminister regarded the undertaking as not only difficult but perilous.\r\nSir Charles Wood, in cabinet (April 11), strongly disapproved of the\r\nextension of income-tax to Ireland, and to the lowering of the exemption\r\nline. On Ireland the plan would lay more than half a million of new\r\ntaxation, whereas much of the relief, such as soap and assessed taxes,\r\nwould not touch her.[287] Palmerston thought it a great plan, perfectly\r\njust, and admirably put together, only it opened too many points of\r\nattack, and it could never be carried: Disraeli was on the watch, the\r\nIrish would join him, so would the radicals, while the succession duty,\r\nto which Palmerston individually had great objection, would estrange\r\nmany conservatives. Lord John Russell perceived difficulties, but he did\r\nnot see an alternative. Graham then fell in, disliked the twofold\r\nextension of the income-tax, and thought they should only take away half\r\nthe soap-tax. Lord Lansdowne (a great Irish landlord) agreed with him.\r\nMr. Gladstone told them that he was willing to propose whatever the\r\ncabinet might decide on, except one thing, namely, the breaking up of\r\nthe basis of the income-tax: that he could not be a party to; he should\r\nregard it as a high political offence. With this reservation he should\r\nfollow their judgment, but he strongly adhered to his whole plan. Lord\r\nAberdeen said, 'You must take care your proposals are not unpopular\r\nones.' Mr. Gladstone replied that it was after applying the test of\r\npopularity, that he was convinced the budget would be damaged beforehand\r\nby some of the small changes that had been suggested.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long and interesting discussion, there stood for the\r\nwhole budget Lord John, Newcastle, Clarendon, Molesworth, Gladstone,\r\nwith Argyll and Aberdeen more or less favourable; for dropping the two\r\nextensions of income-tax and keeping half the soap duty, Lansdowne,\r\nGraham, Wood; more or less leaning towards them, Palmerston and\r\nGranville. They agreed to meet again the next day (April 12), when they\r\ngot into the open sea. Wood stuck to his text. Lansdowne suggested that\r\nan increased spirit duty and an income-tax for Ireland together would be\r\nsomething like a breach of faith. Palmerston thought they would be\r\nbeaten, but he would accept the budget provided they were not to be\r\nbound to dissolve or resign upon such a point as to the two extensions\r\nof the income-tax. Lord John said that if they were beaten on\r\ndifferentiating the tax, they would have to dissolve. Palmerston\r\nexpressed his individual opinion in favour of a distinction for\r\nprecarious incomes, and would act in that sense if he were out of the\r\ngovernment; as it was, he assented. Argyll created a diversion by\r\nsuggesting the abandonment of the Irish spirit duty. Mr. Gladstone\r\nadmitted that he thought the spirit duty the weakest point of the plan,\r\nthough warrantable and tenable on the whole. At last, after further\r\npatient and searching discussion, the cabinet finding that the suggested\r\namendments cut against one another, were for adopting the entire budget,\r\nthe dissentients being Lansdowne, Graham, Wood, and Herbert. Graham was\r\nfull of ill auguries, but said he would assent and assist. Wood looked\r\ngrave, and murmured that he must take time.\r\n\r\n                           CABINET MISGIVINGS\r\n\r\nIn the course of these preliminaries Lord John Russell had gone to\r\nGraham, very uneasy about the income-tax. Graham, though habitually\r\ndesponding, bade him be of good cheer. Their opponents, he said, were in\r\nnumbers strong; but the budget would be excellent to dissolve upon, and\r\nLord John admitted that they would gain forty seats.\r\n\r\nThey agreed, however, in Graham's language, that it would never do to\r\nplay their trump card until the state of the game actually required it.\r\nLord John confessed that he was no judge of figures,--somewhat of a\r\nweakness in a critic of a budget,--and Graham comforted him by the reply\r\nthat he was at any rate the best judge living of House of Commons\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nThe position of the government in the House of Commons was notoriously\r\nweak. The majority that had brought them into existence was excessively\r\nnarrow. It had been well known from the first that if any of the\r\naccidents of a session should happen to draw the tories, the Irish, and\r\nthe radicals into one lobby, ministers would find themselves in a\r\nminority. Small defeats occurred. The budget was only four days off. Mr.\r\nGladstone enters in his diary: 'Spoke against Gibson; beaten by 200-169.\r\nOur third time this week. Very stiff work this. Ellice said dissolution\r\nwould be the end of it; we agreed in the House to a cabinet to-morrow.\r\nHerbert and Cardwell, to whom I spoke, inclined to dissolve.' Next day\r\n(April 15), the cabinet met in a flutter, for the same tactics might\r\nwell be repeated, whenever Mr. Disraeli should think the chances good.\r\n\r\nLord John adverted to the hostility of the radicals as exhibited in the\r\ntone of the debate, and hinted the opinion that they must take in a reef\r\nor two. Mr. Gladstone doubted whether the budget could live in that\r\nHouse, whatever form it might assume; but even with such perils he\r\nshould look upon the whole budget as less unsafe than a partial\r\ncontraction. Graham took the same view of the disposition of parliament:\r\nkeen opposition; lukewarm support; the necessity of a greater party\r\nsympathy and connection to enable them to surmount the difficulties of a\r\nmost unusual and hazardous operation. But he did not appear to lean to\r\ndissolution, and the older members of the cabinet generally declared\r\nthemselves against it. 'In the end we went back to the position that we\r\nmust have a budget on Monday, but Clarendon, Herbert, and Palmerston\r\njoined the chorus of those who said the measure was too sharp upon\r\nIreland. The idea was then started whether we should go the length of\r\nthe entire remission of the consolidated annuities[288] and impose the\r\nincome-tax at sevenpence, with the augmented spirit duty. This view\r\nfound favour generally; and I felt that some excess in the mere\r\nsacrifice of money was no great matter compared with the advantage of so\r\ngreat an approximation to equal taxation.' Then, 'speaking with great\r\ndeference,' Gladstone repeated his belief once more that the entire\r\nbudget was safer than a contracted one, both for the House and the\r\ncountry, and his conviction that if they proposed it, the name and fame\r\nof the government at any rate would stand well. 'Wood seemed still to\r\nhang back, but the rest of the cabinet now appeared well satisfied, and\r\nwe parted, each resolved and certainly more likely to stand or fall by\r\nthe budget as a whole than we seemed to be on Wednesday.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe decisive cabinet was on Saturday, April 16. It was finally settled\r\nthat the budget should be proposed as it stood, with its essential\r\nfeatures unaltered. On Sunday, the chancellor of the exchequer went as\r\nusual twice to church, and read the _Paradiso_; 'but I was obliged,' he\r\nsays, with an accent of contrition, 'to give several hours to my\r\nfigures.' Monday brought the critical moment. 'April 18. Wrote minutes.\r\nRead Shakespeare at night. This day was devoted to working up my papers\r\nand figures for the evening. Then drove and walked with C. [Mrs.\r\nGladstone]. Went at 41/2 to the House. Spoke 43/4 hours in detailing the\r\nfinancial measures, and my strength stood out well, thank God. Many kind\r\ncongratulations afterwards. Herberts and Wortleys came home with us and\r\nhad soup and negus.'\r\n\r\n                      LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nThe proceeding that figures here so simply was, in fact, one of the\r\ngreat parliamentary performances of the century. Lord Aberdeen wrote to\r\nPrince Albert that 'the display of power was wonderful; it was agreed in\r\nall quarters that there had been nothing like the speech for many years,\r\nand that under the impression of his commanding eloquence the reception\r\nof the budget had been most favourable.' Lord John told the Queen the\r\nspeech was one of the ablest ever made in the House of Commons. 'Mr.\r\nPitt, in the days of his glory, might have been more imposing, but he\r\ncould not have been more persuasive.' Lord Aberdeen heard from Windsor\r\nthe next day: 'The Queen must write a line to Lord Aberdeen to say how\r\ndelighted she is at the great success of Mr. Gladstone's speech last\r\nnight.... We have every reason to be sanguine now, which is a great\r\nrelief to the Queen.' Prince Albert used the same language to Mr.\r\nGladstone: 'I cannot resist writing you a line in order to congratulate\r\nyou on the success of your speech of yesterday. I have just completed a\r\nclose and careful perusal of it and should certainly have cheered had I\r\na seat in the House. I hear from all sides that the budget has been well\r\nreceived. Trusting that your Christian humility will not allow you to be\r\ndangerously elated, I cannot help sending for your perusal the report\r\nwhich Lord John Russell sent to the Queen, feeling sure that it will\r\ngive you pleasure, such approbation being the best reward a public man\r\ncan have.'\r\n\r\nOn the cardinal question of the fortunes of the ministry its effect was\r\ndecisive. The prime minister wrote to Mr. Gladstone himself (April 19):\r\n'While everybody is congratulating _me_ on the wonderful impression\r\nproduced in the House of Commons last night, it seems only reasonable\r\nthat I should have a word of congratulation for _you_. You will believe\r\nhow much more sincerely I rejoice on your account than on my own,\r\nalthough most assuredly, if the existence of my government shall be\r\nprolonged, it will be your work.' To Madame de Lieven Aberdeen said that\r\nGladstone had given a strength and lustre to the administration which it\r\ncould not have derived from anything else. No testimony was more\r\nagreeable to Mr. Gladstone than a letter from Lady Peel. 'I know the\r\nrecollections,' he replied, 'with which you must have written, and\r\ntherefore I will not scruple to say that as I was inspired by the\r\nthought of treading, however unequally, in the steps of my great teacher\r\nand master in public affairs, so it was one of my keenest anxieties not\r\nto do dishonour to his memory, or injustice to the patriotic policy with\r\nwhich his name is forever associated.'[289]\r\n\r\n                     POWER OF THE PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\nGreville makes a true point when he says that the budget speech 'has\r\nraised Gladstone to a great political elevation, and what is of far\r\ngreater consequence than the measure itself, has given the country\r\nassurance of a _man_ equal to great political necessities and fit to\r\nlead parties and direct governments.'[290] Mr. Gladstone had made many\r\nspeeches that were in a high degree interesting, ingenious, attractive,\r\nforcible. He now showed that besides and apart from all this, he was the\r\npossessor of qualities without which no amount of rhetorician's glitter\r\ncommands the House of Commons for a single hour after the fireworks have\r\nceased to blaze. He showed that he had precise perception, positive and\r\nconstructive purpose, and a powerful will. In 1851, he had on two\r\noccasions exhibited the highest competency as a critic of the budget of\r\nSir Charles Wood. On the memorable night in the previous December, when\r\nhe had torn Mr. Disraeli's budget to pieces, he had proved how\r\nterrifying he could be in exposure and assault. He now triumphantly met\r\nthe test that he had triumphantly applied to his predecessor, and\r\npresented a command of even more imposing resources in the task of\r\nresponsible construction than he had displayed in irresponsible\r\ncriticism. The speech was saturated with fact; the horizons were large;\r\nand the opening of each in the long series of topics, from Mr. Pitt and\r\nthe great war, down to the unsuspected connection between the repeal of\r\nthe soap-tax and the extinction of the slave trade in Africa, was\r\nexalted and spacious. The arguments throughout were close, persuasive,\r\nexhaustive; the moral appeal was in the only tone worthy of a great\r\nminister addressing a governing assembly--a masculine invocation of\r\ntheir intellectual and political courage. This is the intrepid way in\r\nwhich a strong parliament and a strong nation like to see public\r\ndifficulties handled, and they now welcomed the appearance of a new\r\nminister, who rejected what he called narrow and flimsy expedients, of\r\nwhich so much had been seen in the last half dozen years; who was not\r\nafraid to make a stand against heedless men with hearts apparently set\r\non drying up one source of revenue after another; who did not shrink\r\nfrom sconcing the powerful landed phalanx like other people; and who at\r\nthe same time boldly used and manfully defended the most unpopular of\r\nall the public imposts. In politics the spectacle of sheer courage is\r\noften quite as good in its influence and effect as the best of logic. It\r\nwas so here. While proposing that the income-tax should come to an end\r\nin seven years, he yet produced the most comprehensive analysis and the\r\nboldest vindication of the structure of the tax as it stood. His manner\r\nwas plain, often almost conversational, but his elaborate examination of\r\nthe principles of an income-tax remains to this day a master example of\r\naccurate reasoning thrown into delightful form. He admitted all the\r\nobjections to it: the inquisition that it entailed, the frauds to which\r\nit led, the sense in the public mind of its injustice in laying the same\r\nrate upon the holder of idle and secured public funds, upon the\r\nindustrious trader, upon the precarious earnings of the professional\r\nman. It was these disadvantages that made him plan the extinction of the\r\ntax at the end of a definite period, when the salutary remissions of\r\nother burdens now proposed would have had time to bring forth their\r\nfruits. As was said by a later chancellor of the exchequer, this speech\r\nnot only won 'universal applause from his audience at the time, but\r\nchanged the convictions of a large part of the nation, and turned, at\r\nleast for several years, a current of popular opinion which had seemed\r\ntoo powerful for any minister to resist.'[291]\r\n\r\nThe succession duty brought Mr. Gladstone into the first conflict of his\r\nlife with the House of Lords. That land should be made to pay like other\r\nforms of property Was a proposition denounced as essentially\r\nimpracticable, oppressive, unjust, cowardly, and absurd. It was called\r\n_ex post facto_ legislation. It was one of the most obnoxious,\r\ndetestable, and odious measures ever proposed. Its author was a vulture\r\nsoaring over society, waiting for the rich harvest that death would pour\r\ninto his treasury. Lord Derby invoked him as a phoenix chancellor, in\r\nwhom Mr. Pitt rose from his ashes with double lustre, for Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad ventured where Pitt had failed. He admitted that nothing short of\r\nthe chancellor's extraordinary skill and dexterity could have carried\r\nproposals so evil through the House of Commons.[292] Meanwhile the\r\npublic counted up their gains: a remission on tea, good for twenty\r\nshillings a year in an ordinary household; a fall in the washing bill; a\r\nboon of a couple of pounds for the man who insured his life for five\r\nhundred; an easy saving of ten pounds a year in the assessed taxes, and\r\nso forth,--the whole performance ending with 'a dissolving view of the\r\ndecline and fall' of the hated income-tax.\r\n\r\n                    SUCCESSION DUTY AND REDEMPTION\r\n\r\nThe financial proceedings of this year included a proposal for the\r\nredemption of South Sea stock and an attempted operation on the national\r\ndebt, by the creation of new stocks bearing a lower rate of interest,\r\ntwo options of conversion being given to the holders of old stock. The\r\nidea of the creation of a two-and-half-per-cent. stock, said Mr.\r\nGladstone in later years, though in those days novel, was very\r\nfavourably received.[293]\r\n\r\n     I produced my plan. Disraeli offered it a malignant opposition. He\r\n     made a demand for time; the one demand that ought not to have been\r\n     made. In proposals of this kind, it is allowed to be altogether\r\n     improper. In 1844 Mr. Goulburn was permitted, I think, to carry\r\n     through with great expedition his plan for a large reduction of\r\n     interest. When Mr. Goschen produced his still larger and much more\r\n     important measure, we, the opposition, did our best to expedite\r\n     the decision. There are no complications requiring time on such an\r\n     occasion. It is a matter of aye or no. But when time is allowed the\r\n     chapter of accidents allows an opponent to hope that a situation\r\n     known to be unusually happy will deteriorate. Of this contingency\r\n     Disraeli took his chance. Time as it happened was in his favour. It\r\n     was no question of the substance of the plan, but a moderate change\r\n     in the political barometer, which reduced to two or three millions\r\n     a subscription which at the right moment would probably have been\r\n     twenty or thirty.[294]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to W. R. Farquhar (March 8, 1861) he makes further remarks,\r\nwhich are introspective and autobiographic:--\r\n\r\n     Looking back now upon those of my proceedings in 1853 which related\r\n     to interest upon exchequer bills and to the reduction of interest\r\n     on the public debt, I think that there was nothing in the proposals\r\n     themselves which might not have taken full and quick effect, if\r\n     they had been made at a time which I may best describe as the time\r\n     that precedes high-water with respect to abundance of money and\r\n     security of the market. As respects exchequer bills, I am decidedly\r\n     of opinion that the rates of premium current for some years before\r\n     '53 were wholly incompatible with a sound state of things: and the\r\n     fluctuations then were even greater than since. Still I think that\r\n     I committed an error from want of sufficient quickness in\r\n     discerning the signs of the times, for we were upon the very eve of\r\n     an altered state of things, and any alteration of a kind at all\r\n     serious was enough to make the period unfit for those grave\r\n     operations. It is far from being the first or only time when I have\r\n     had reason to lament my own deficiency in the faculty of rapid and\r\n     comprehensive observation. I failed to see that high-water was just\r\n     past; and that although the tide had not perceptibly fallen, yet it\r\n     was going to fall. The truth likewise is this (to go a step further\r\n     in my confessions) that almost all my experience in money affairs\r\n     had been of a most difficult and trying kind, under circumstances\r\n     which admitted of no choice but obliged me to sail always very\r\n     near the wind, and this induced a habit of more daring navigation\r\n     than I could now altogether approve. Nor will I excuse myself by\r\n     saying that others were deceived like me, for none of them were in\r\n     a condition to have precisely my responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnother note contributes a further point of explanation: 'I have always\r\nimagined that this fault was due to my experience in the affairs of the\r\nHawarden and Oak Farm estates, where it was an incessant course of\r\nsailing near the wind, and there was really no other hope.'\r\n\r\n                               INCOME-TAX\r\n\r\nSeven years later Mr. Gladstone, once more chancellor of the exchequer,\r\nagain produced a budget. Semi-ironic cheers met his semi-ironic\r\nexpression of an expectation that he would be asked the question: what\r\nhad become of the calculations of 1853? The succession duty proved a\r\nwoeful disappointment, and instead of producing two million pounds,\r\nproduced only six hundred thousand. A similar but greater\r\ndisappointment, we must recollect, owing mainly to a singular\r\nmiscalculation as to the income-tax, had marked Peel's memorable budget\r\nof 1842, which landed him in a deficiency of nearly two and a quarter\r\nmillions, instead of a surplus of half a million.[295] Of the\r\ndisappointment in his own case, Mr. Gladstone when the time came\r\npropounded an explanation, only moderately conclusive. I need not\r\ndiscuss it, for as everybody knows, the effective reason why the\r\nincome-tax could not be removed was the heavy charge created by the\r\nCrimean war. What is more to the point in estimating the finance of\r\n1853, is its effect in enabling us to meet the strain of the war. It was\r\nthis finance that, continuing the work begun by Peel, made the country\r\nin 1859 richer by more than sixteen per cent, than it had been in 1853.\r\nIt was this finance, that by clinching the open questions that enveloped\r\nthe income-tax, and setting it upon a defensible foundation while it\r\nlasted, bore us through the struggle. Unluckily, in demonstrating the\r\nperils of meddling with the structure of the tax, in showing its power\r\nand simplicity, the chancellor was at the same time providing the\r\neasiest means, if not also the most direct incentive, to that policy of\r\nexpenditure--it rose from fifty to seventy millions between 1853 and\r\n1859--which was one of the most fatal obstacles to the foremost aims of\r\nhis political life. It was twenty years from now, as my readers will\r\nsee, before the effort, now foreshadowed, to exclude the income-tax from\r\nthe ordinary sources of national revenue, reached its dramatic close.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[284] A curious parliamentary incident occurred. The original proposal\r\nwas to reduce the duty from eighteen-pence to sixpence. A motion to\r\nrepeal it altogether was rejected by ten. Then a motion was made to\r\nsubstitute zero for sixpence in the clause. The Speaker ruled that this\r\nreversal of the previous vote was not out of order, and it was carried\r\nby nine.\r\n\r\n[285] Some may place first the Act of 1833 making real estate liable for\r\nsimple contract debts.\r\n\r\n[286] Mrs. Simpson's _Many Memories_, p. 237.\r\n\r\n[287] For paper on Irish income-tax, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[288] Loans made to Ireland for various purposes.\r\n\r\n[289] Cavour, as Costi's letters show, took an eager interest in Mr.\r\nGladstone's budget speech.\r\n\r\n[290] Greville, Third Series, i. p. 59.\r\n\r\n[291] Northcote, _Twenty Years of Financial Policy_, p. 185.\r\n\r\n[292] Mr. Gladstone received valuable aid from Bethell, the\r\nsolicitor-general. On leaving, office in 1855 he wrote to Bethell:\r\n'After having had to try your patience more than once in circumstances\r\nof real difficulty, I have found your kindness inexhaustible, and your\r\naid invaluable, so that I really can ill tell on which of the two I look\r\nback with the greater pleasure. The memory of the Succession Duty bill\r\nis to me something like what Inkermann may be to a private of the\r\nGuards: you were the sergeant from whom I got my drill and whose hand\r\nand voice carried me through.'\r\n\r\n[293] The city articles of the time justify this statement.\r\n\r\n[294] Gladstone Memo., 1897. See also Appendix.\r\n\r\n[295] It may be said, however, that Peel was right about the yield of\r\nthe income-tax, and only overlooked the fact that it would not all be\r\ncollected, within the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           THE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\n                            (_1853-1854_)\r\n\r\n     He [Burke] maintained that the attempt to bring the Turkish empire\r\n     into the consideration of the balance of power in Europe was\r\n     extremely new, and contrary to all former political systems. He\r\n     pointed out in strong terms the danger and impolity of our\r\n     espousing the Ottoman cause.--BURKE (1791).\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the session Mr. Gladstone had gone on a visit to Dunrobin, and\r\nthere he was laid up with illness for many days. It was the end of\r\nSeptember before he was able to travel south. At Dingwall they presented\r\nhim (Sept. 27) with the freedom of that ancient burgh. He spoke of\r\nhimself as having completed the twenty-first year of his political life,\r\nand as being almost the youngest of those veteran statesmen who occupied\r\nthe chief places in the counsels of the Queen. At Inverness the same\r\nevening, he told them that in commercial legislation he had reaped where\r\nothers had sown; that he had enjoyed the privilege of taking a humble\r\nbut laborious part in realising those principles of free trade which, in\r\nthe near future, would bring, in the train of increased intercourse and\r\naugmented wealth, that closer social and moral union of the nations of\r\nthe earth which men all so fervently desire, and which must in the\r\nfulness of time lessen the frequency of strife and war. Yet even while\r\nthe hopeful words were falling from the speaker's lips, he might have\r\nheard, not in far distance but close at hand, the trumpets and drums,\r\nthe heavy rumbling of the cannon, and all the clangour of a world in\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                         OTTOMANS AND THE WEST\r\n\r\nOne of the central and perennial interests of Mr. Gladstone's life was\r\nthat shifting, intractable, and interwoven tangle of conflicting\r\ninterests, rival peoples, and antagonistic faiths, that is veiled under\r\nthe easy name of the Eastern question. The root of the Eastern question,\r\nas everybody almost too well knows, is the presence of the Ottoman Turks\r\nin Europe, their possession of Constantinople,--that incomparable centre\r\nof imperial power standing in Europe but facing Asia,--and their\r\nsovereignty as Mahometan masters over Christian races. In one of the few\r\npicturesque passages of his eloquence Mr. Gladstone once described the\r\nposition of these races. 'They were like a shelving beach that\r\nrestrained the ocean. That beach, it is true, is beaten by the waves; it\r\nis laid desolate; it produces nothing; it becomes perhaps nothing save a\r\nmass of shingle, of rock, of almost useless sea-weed. But it is a fence\r\nbehind which the cultivated earth can spread, and escape the incoming\r\ntide, and such was the resistance of Bulgarians, of Servians, and of\r\nGreeks. It was that resistance which left Europe to claim the enjoyment\r\nof her own religion and to develop her institutions and her laws.' This\r\nsecular strife between Ottoman and Christian gradually became a struggle\r\namong Christian powers of northern and western Europe, to turn\r\ntormenting questions in the east to the advantage of rival ambitions of\r\ntheir own. At a certain epoch in the eighteenth century Russia first\r\nseized her place among the Powers. By the end of the century she had\r\npushed her force into the west by the dismemberment of Poland; she had\r\nmade her way to the southern shores of the Black Sea; and while still\r\nthe most barbaric of all the states, she had made good a vague claim to\r\nexercise the guardianship of civilisation on behalf of the Christian\r\nraces and the Orthodox church. This claim it was that led at varying\r\nintervals of time, and with many diversities of place, plea, and colour,\r\nto crisis after crisis springing up within the Turkish empire, but\r\nhenceforth all of them apt to spread with dangerous contagion to\r\ngovernments beyond Ottoman limits.\r\n\r\nEngland, unlike France, had no systematic tradition upon this\r\ncomplicated struggle. When war began between Russia and the Porte in\r\n1771, we supported Russia and helped her to obtain an establishment in\r\nthe Black Sea. Towards the end of 1782 when Catherine by a sort of\r\nroyal syllogism, as Fox called it, took the Crimea into her own hands,\r\nthe whig cabinet of the hour did not think it necessary to lend Turkey\r\ntheir support, though France and Spain proposed a combination to resist.\r\nThen came Pitt. The statesman whose qualities of greatness so profoundly\r\nimpressed his contemporaries has usually been praised as a minister\r\ndevoted to peace, and only driven by the French Revolution into the long\r\nwar. His preparations in 1791 for a war with Russia on behalf of the\r\nTurk are a serious deduction from this estimate. Happily the alarms of\r\nthe Baltic trade, and the vigorous reasoning of Fox, produced such an\r\neffect upon opinion, that Pitt was driven, on peril of the overthrow of\r\nhis government, to find the best expedient he could to bring the\r\nbusiness to an end without extremities. In 1853 the country was less\r\nfortunate than it had been in 1791.\r\n\r\nA Russian diplomatist made a homely comparison of the Eastern question\r\nto the gout; now its attack is in the foot, now in the hand; but all is\r\nsafe if only it does not fly to a vital part. In 1852 the Eastern\r\nquestion showed signs of flying to the heart, and a catastrophe was\r\nsure. A dispute between Greek and Latin religious as to the custody of\r\nthe holy places at Jerusalem, followed by the diplomatic rivalries of\r\ntheir respective patrons, Russia and France, produced a crisis that was\r\nat first of no extraordinary pattern. The quarrel between two packs of\r\nmonks about a key and a silver star was a trivial symbol of the vast\r\nrivalry of centuries between powerful churches, between great states,\r\nbetween heterogeneous races. The dispute about the holy places was\r\nadjusted, but was immediately followed by a claim from the Czar for\r\nrecognition by treaty of his rights as protector of the Sultan's\r\nChristian subjects. This claim the Sultan, with encouragement from the\r\nBritish ambassador, rejected, and the Czar marched troops into the\r\nDanubian provinces, to hold them in pledge until the required concession\r\nshould be made to his high protective claims. This issue was no good\r\ncause for a general conflagration. Unfortunately many combustibles\r\nhappened to lie about the world at that time, and craft,\r\nmisunderstanding, dupery, autocratic pride, democratic hurry, combined\r\nto spread the blaze.\r\n\r\n                        DIPLOMATIC RIVALRIES\r\n\r\nThe story is still fresh. With the detailed history of the diplomacy\r\nthat preceded the outbreak of war between England, France, and Turkey on\r\nthe one part and Russia on the other, we have here happily only the\r\nsmallest concern. The large question, as it presented itself to Mr.\r\nGladstone's mind in later years, and as it presents itself now to the\r\nhistoric student, had hardly then emerged to the view of the statesmen\r\nof the western Powers. Would the success of Russian designs at that day\r\nmean anything better than the transfer of the miserable Christian races\r\nto the yoke of a new master?[296] Or was the repulse of these designs\r\nnecessary to secure to the Christian races--who, by the by, were not\r\nparticularly good friends to one another--the power of governing\r\nthemselves without any master, either Russian or Turk? To this question,\r\nso decisive as it is in judging the policy of the Crimean war, it is not\r\nquite easy even now for the historian--who has many other things to\r\nthink of than has the contemporary politician--to give a confident\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nNicholas was not without advisers who warned him that the break-up of\r\nTurkey by force of Russian arms might be to the deliverer a loss and not\r\na gain. Brunnow, then Russian ambassador at St. James's, said to his\r\nsovereign: 'The war in its results would cause to spring out of the\r\nruins of Turkey all kinds of new states, as ungrateful to us as Greece\r\nhas been, as troublesome as the Danubian Principalities have been, and\r\nan order of things where our influence will be more sharply combated,\r\nresisted, restrained, by the rivalries of France, England, Austria, than\r\nit has ever been under the Ottoman. War cannot turn to our direct\r\nadvantage. We shall shed our blood and spend our treasure in order that\r\nKing Otho may gain Thessaly; that the English may take more islands at\r\ntheir own convenience; that the French too may get their share; and that\r\nthe Ottoman empire may be transformed into independent states, which\r\nfor us will only become either burdensome clients or hostile\r\nneighbours.' If this forecast was right, then to resist Russia was at\r\nonce to prevent her from embarrassing and weakening herself, and to lock\r\nup the Christians in their cruel prison-house for a quarter of a century\r\nlonger. If sagacious calculation in such a vein as this were the\r\nmainspring of the world, history would be stripped of many a crimson\r\npage. But far-sighted calculation can no longer be ascribed to the\r\nactors in this tragedy of errors--to Nicholas or Napoleon, to Aberdeen\r\nor Palmerston, or to any other of them excepting Cavour and the Turk.\r\n\r\nIn England both people and ministers have been wont to change their\r\nminds upon the Eastern question. In the war between Russia and Turkey in\r\n1828, during the last stage of the struggle for Greek independence,\r\nRussia as Greek champion against the Turk had the English populace on\r\nher side; Palmerston was warmly with her, regarding even her advance to\r\nConstantinople with indifference; and Aberdeen was reproached as a\r\nTurkish sympathiser. Now we shall see the parts inverted,--England and\r\nPalmerston ardent Turks, and Aberdeen falling into disgrace (unjustly\r\nenough) as Russian. Before we have done with Mr. Gladstone, the popular\r\nwheel will be found to make another and yet another revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                           THE BRITISH CABINET\r\n\r\nWhen Kinglake's first two volumes of his history of the Crimean war\r\nappeared (1863), Mr. Gladstone wrote to a friend (May 14): 'Kinglake is\r\nfit to be a brilliant popular author, but quite unfit to be a historian.\r\nHis book is too bad to live, and too good to die. As to the matter most\r\ndirectly within my cognisance, he is not only not too true, but so\r\nentirely void of resemblance to the truth, that one asks what was really\r\nthe original of his picture.'[297] A little earlier he had written to\r\nSir John Acton: 'I was not the important person in the negotiation\r\nbefore the war that Mr. Kinglake seems to suppose; and with him every\r\nsupposition becomes an axiom and a dogma.' All the papers from various\r\nsources to which I have had access show that Mr. Gladstone, as he has\r\njust said, had no special share in the various resolutions taken in the\r\ndecisive period that ended with the abandonment of the Vienna note in\r\nthe early autumn of 1853. He has himself told us that through the whole\r\nof this critical stage Lord Clarendon, then in charge of foreign\r\naffairs, was the centre of a distinct set of communications, first, with\r\nthe prime minister, next, with Lord John Russell as leader in the\r\nCommons, and third, with Lord Palmerston, whose long and active career\r\nat the foreign office had given him special weight in that department.\r\nThe cabinet as a body was a machine incapable of being worked by\r\nanything like daily and sometimes hourly consultations of this kind,\r\n'the upshot of which would only become known on the more important\r\noccasions to the ministers at large, especially to those among them\r\ncharged with the most laborious departments.'[298] This was not at all\r\nsaid by way of exculpating Mr. Gladstone from his full share of\r\nresponsibility for the war, for of that he never at any time showed the\r\nleast wish or intention to clear himself, but rather the contrary. As\r\nmatter of fact, it was the four statesmen just named who were in\r\neffective control of proceedings until the breakdown of the Vienna note,\r\nand the despatch of the British and French squadrons through the\r\nDardanelles in October, opened the second stage of the diplomatic\r\ncampaign, and led directly if not rapidly to its fatal climax.\r\n\r\nWe have little more than a few glimpses of Mr. Gladstone's participation\r\nin the counsels of the eventful months that preceded the outbreak of the\r\nwar. To Mrs. Gladstone he writes (October 4): 'I can hardly at this\r\nmoment write about anything else than the Turkish declaration of war.\r\nThis is a most serious event, and at once raises the question, Are we\r\nto go into it? The cabinet meets on Friday, and you must not be\r\nsurprised at anything that may happen. The weather may be smooth; it\r\nalso may be _very rough_.' First the smooth weather came. 'October 7. We\r\nhave had our cabinet, three hours and a half; all there but Graham and\r\nMolesworth,[299] who would both have been strongly for peace. We shall\r\nhave another to-morrow, to look over our results in writing. Some\r\nstartling things were said and proposed, but I think that as far as\r\ngovernment is concerned, all will probably keep straight at this\r\njuncture, and as to war I hope we shall not be involved in it, even if\r\nit goes on between Russia and Turkey, which is not quite certain.'\r\nAberdeen himself thought the aspect of this cabinet of the 7th on the\r\nwhole very good, Gladstone arguing strongly against a proposal of\r\nPalmerston's that England should enter into an engagement with Turkey to\r\nfurnish her with naval assistance. Most of the cabinet were for peace.\r\nLord John was warlike, but subdued in tone. Palmerston urged his views\r\n'perseveringly but not disagreeably.' The final instruction was a\r\ncompromise, bringing the fleet to Constantinople, but limiting its\r\nemployment to operations of a strictly defensive character. This was one\r\nof those peculiar compromises that in their sequel contain surrender.\r\nThe step soon showed how critical it was. Well indeed might Lord\r\nAberdeen tell the Queen that it would obviously every day become more\r\nand more difficult to draw the line between defensive and offensive,\r\nbetween an auxiliary and a principal. So much simpler is a distinction\r\nin words than in things. Still, he was able to assure her that, though\r\ngrounds of difference existed, the discussions of the cabinet of the 8th\r\nwere carried on amicably and in good humour. With straightforward common\r\nsense the Queen pressed the prime minister for his own deliberate\r\ncounsel on the spirit and ultimate tendency of the policy that he would\r\nrecommend her to approve. In fact, Lord Aberdeen had no deliberate\r\ncounsel to proffer. Speedily the weather roughened.\r\n\r\n                         SPEECH AT MANCHESTER\r\n\r\nFour days later (October 12) the minister repeated that, while elements\r\nof wide difference existed, still the appearance of that day was more\r\nfavourable and tended to mutual agreement. At this cabinet Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas not present, having gone on an expedition to Manchester, the first\r\nof the many triumphal visits of his life to the great industrial centres\r\nof the nation. 'Nothing,' he wrote to Lord Aberdeen, 'could have gone\r\noff better. Yesterday (October 11), I had to make a visit to the\r\nExchange, which was crammed and most cordial. This morning we had first\r\nthe \"inauguration\" of the Peel statue, in the presence of an enormous\r\naudience--misnamed so, inasmuch as but a portion of them could hear; and\r\nthen a meeting in the Town Hall, where there were addresses and speeches\r\nmade, to which I had to reply. I found the feeling of the assemblage so\r\nfriendly that I said more on the war question than I had intended, but I\r\nsincerely hope I did not transgress the limits you would think it wise\r\nfor me to observe. The existence of a peace and a war party was evident,\r\nfrom alternate manifestations, but I think the former feeling was\r\ndecidedly the stronger, and at any rate I should say without the\r\nsmallest doubt that the feeling of the whole meeting as a mass was\r\nunequivocally favourable to the course that the government have\r\npursued.'\r\n\r\n'Your Manchester speech,' Lord Aberdeen wrote to him in reply, 'has\r\nproduced a great and, I hope, a very beneficial effect upon the public\r\nmind, and it has much promoted the cause of peace.' This result was\r\nextremely doubtful. The language of the Manchester speech is cloudy, but\r\nwhat it comes to is this. It recognises the duty of maintaining the\r\nintegrity and independence of the Ottoman empire. Independence, however,\r\nin this case, says Mr. Gladstone, designates a sovereignty full of\r\nanomaly, of misery, of difficulty, and it has been subject every few\r\nyears since we were born to European discussion and interference; we\r\ncannot forget the political solecism of Mahometans exercising despotic\r\nrule over twelve millions of our fellow Christians; into the questions\r\ngrowing out of this political solecism we are not now entering; what we\r\nsee to-day is something different; it is the necessity for regulating\r\nthe distribution of power in Europe; the absorption of power by one of\r\nthe great potentates of Europe, which would follow the fall of the\r\nOttoman rule, would be dangerous to the peace of the world, and it is\r\nthe duty of England, at whatever cost, to set itself against such a\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Gladstone's first public entry upon one of the most\r\npassionate of all the objects of his concern for forty years to come. He\r\nhears the desolate cry, then but faint, for the succour of the oppressed\r\nChristians. He looks to European interference to terminate the hateful\r\nsolecism. He resists the interference single-handed of the northern\r\ninvader. It was intolerable that Russia should be allowed to work her\r\nwill upon Turkey as an outlawed state.[300] In other words, the\r\npartition of Turkey was not to follow the partition of Poland. What we\r\nshortly call the Crimean war was to Mr. Gladstone the vindication of the\r\npublic law of Europe against a wanton disturber. This was a\r\ncharacteristic example of his insistent search for a broad sentiment and\r\na comprehensive moral principle. The principle in its present\r\napplication had not really much life in it; the formula was narrow, as\r\nother invasions of public law within the next dozen years were to show.\r\nBut the clear-cut issues of history only disclose themselves in the long\r\nresult of Time. It was the diplomatic labyrinth of the passing hour\r\nthrough which the statesmen of the coalition had to thread their way.\r\nThe disastrous end was what Mr. Disraeli christened the coalition war.\r\n\r\n'The first year of the coalition government,' Lord Aberdeen wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'was eminently prosperous, and this was chiefly owing to your\r\nown personal exertions, and to the boldness, ability, and success of\r\nyour financial measures. Our second year, if not specially brilliant,\r\nmight still have proved greatly advantageous to the country, had we\r\npossessed the courage to resist popular clamour and to avoid war; but\r\nthis calamity aggravated all other causes of disunion and led to our\r\ndissolution.'[301]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                         ENGLAND SLOWLY DRAWN IN\r\n\r\nOn November 4, Clarendon wrote to Lord Aberdeen that they were now in an\r\nanomalous and painful position, and he had arrived at the conviction\r\nthat it might have been avoided by firm language and a more decided\r\ncourse five months ago. 'Russia would then, as she is now, have been\r\nready to come to terms, and we should have exercised a control over the\r\nTurks that is now not to be obtained.' Nobody, I suppose, doubts to-day\r\nthat if firmer language had been used in June to Sultan and Czar alike,\r\nthe catastrophe of war would probably have been avoided, as Lord\r\nClarendon here remorsefully reflects. However that may have been, this\r\npregnant and ominous avowal disclosed the truth that the British cabinet\r\nwere no longer their own masters; that they had in a great degree, even\r\nat this early time, lost all that freedom of action which they\r\nconstantly proclaimed it the rule of their policy to maintain, and which\r\nfor a few months longer some of them at least strove very hard but all\r\nin vain to recover.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were driving at war whilst we were labouring for peace, and\r\nboth by diplomatic action and by sending the fleet to protect Turkish\r\nterritory against Russian attack, we had become auxiliaries and turned\r\nthe weaker of the two contending powers into the stronger. A few months\r\nafterwards Mr. Gladstone found a classic parallel for the Turkish\r\nalliance. 'When Aeneas escaped from the flames of Troy he had an ally.\r\nThat ally was his father Anchises, and the part which Aeneas performed\r\nin the alliance was to carry his ally upon his back.' But the discovery\r\ncame too late, nor was the Turk the only ally. Against the remonstrances\r\nof our ambassador the Sultan declared war upon Russia, and proceeded to\r\nacts of war, well knowing that England and France in what they believed\r\nto be interests of their own would see him through it. If the Sultan and\r\nhis ulemas and his pashas were one intractable factor, the French\r\nEmperor was another. 'We have just as much to apprehend,' Graham wrote\r\n(Oct. 27), 'from the active intervention of our ally as from the open\r\nhostility of our enemy.' Behind the decorous curtain of European\r\nconcert Napoleon III. was busily weaving scheme after scheme of his own\r\nto fix his unsteady diadem upon his brow, to plant his dynasty among the\r\ngreat thrones of western Europe, and to pay off some old scores of\r\npersonal indignity put upon him by the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Czar fell into all the mistakes that a man could. Emperor by divine\r\nright, he had done his best to sting the self-esteem of the\r\nrevolutionary emperor in Paris. By his language to the British\r\nambassador about dividing the inheritance of the sick man, he had\r\nquickened the suspicions of the English cabinet. It is true the sick man\r\nwill die, said Lord John Russell, but it may not be for twenty, fifty,\r\nor a hundred years to come; when William III. and Louis XIV. signed\r\ntheir treaty for the partition of the Spanish monarchy, they first made\r\nsure that the death of the king was close at hand. Then the choice as\r\nagent at Constantinople of the arrogant and unskilful Menschikoff proved\r\na dire misfortune. Finally, the Czar was fatally misled by his own\r\nambassador in London. Brunnow reported that all the English liberals and\r\neconomists were convinced that the notion of Turkish reform was absurd;\r\nthat Aberdeen had told him in accents of contempt and anger, 'I hate the\r\nTurks'; and that English views generally as to Russian aggression and\r\nTurkish interests had been sensibly modified. All this was not untrue,\r\nbut it was not true enough to bear the inference that was drawn from it\r\nat St. Petersburg. The deception was disastrous, and Brunnow was never\r\nforgiven for it.[302]\r\n\r\n                     LORD STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE\r\n\r\nAnother obstacle to a pacific solution, perhaps most formidable of them\r\nall, was Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the British ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. Animated by a vehement antipathy to Russia, possessing\r\nalmost sovereign ascendency at the Porte, believing that the Turk might\r\nnever meet a happier chance of having the battle out with his adversary\r\nonce for all, and justly confident that a policy of war would find\r\nhearty backers in the London cabinet--in him the government had an\r\nagent who while seeming to follow instructions in the narrow letter\r\nbaffled them in their spirit. In the autumn of 1853 Lord Aberdeen wrote\r\nto Graham, 'I fear I must renounce the sanguine view I have hitherto\r\ntaken of the Eastern question; for nothing can be more alarming than the\r\npresent prospect. I thought that we should have been able to conquer\r\nStratford, but I begin to fear that the reverse will be the case, and\r\nthat he will succeed in defeating us. Although at our wit's end,\r\nClarendon and I are still labouring in the cause of peace; but really to\r\ncontend at once with the pride of the Emperor, the fanaticism of the\r\nTurks, and the dishonesty of Stratford is almost a hopeless\r\nattempt.'[303] This description, when he saw it nearly forty years\r\nlater, seems to have struck Mr. Gladstone as harsh. Though he agreed\r\nthat the passage could hardly be omitted, he confessed his surprise that\r\nLord Aberdeen should have applied the word dishonesty to Lord Stratford.\r\nHe suggested the addition of a note that should recognise the general\r\ncharacter of Lord Stratford, and should point out that prejudice and\r\npassion, by their blinding powers, often produce in the mind effects\r\nlike those proper to dishonesty.[304] Perhaps we may find this a hard\r\nsaying. Doubtless when he comes to praise and blame, the political\r\nhistorian must make due allowance for his actors; and charity is the\r\ngrandest of illuminants. Still hard truth stands first, and amiable\r\nanalysis of the psychology of a diplomatic agent who lets loose a flood\r\nof mischief on mankind is by no means what interests us most about him.\r\nWhy not call things by their right names?[305]\r\n\r\nIn his private letters (November) Stratford boldly exhibited his desire\r\nfor war, and declared that 'the war, to be successful, must be a very\r\ncomprehensive war on the part of England and France.' Well might the\r\nQueen say to the prime minister that it had become a serious question\r\nwhether they were justified in allowing Lord Stratford any longer to\r\nremain in a situation that enabled him to frustrate all the efforts of\r\nhis government for peace. Yet here, as many another time in these\r\ndevious manoeuvres, that fearful dilemma interposed--inseparable in its\r\nmany forms from all collective action whether in cabinet or party; so\r\nfit to test to the very uttermost all the moral fortitude, all the\r\nwisdom of a minister, his sense of proportion, his strength of will, his\r\nprudent pliancy of judgment, his power of balance, his sure perception\r\nof the ruling fact. The dilemma here is patent. To recall Lord Stratford\r\nwould be to lose Lord Palmerston and Lord John; to lose them would be to\r\nbreak up the government; to break up the government would be to sunder\r\nthe slender thread on which the chances of peace were hanging.[306] The\r\nthought, in short, of the high-minded Aberdeen striving against hope to\r\nplay a steadfast and pacific part in a scene so sinister, among actors\r\nof such equivocal or crooked purpose, recalls nothing so much as the\r\nmemorable picture long ago of Maria Theresa beset and baffled by her\r\nKaunitzes and Thuguts, Catherines, Josephs, great Fredericks, Grand\r\nTurks, and wringing her hands over the consummation of an iniquitous\r\npolicy to which the perversity of man and circumstance had driven her.\r\n\r\nAs the proceedings in the cabinet dragged on through the winter, new\r\nprojects were mooted. The ground was shifted to what Lord Stratford had\r\ncalled a comprehensive war upon Russia. Some of the cabinet began to aim\r\nat a transformation of the policy. It was suggested that the moment\r\nshould be seized to obtain not merely the observance by Russia of her\r\ntreaty obligations to Turkey, but a revision and modification of the\r\ntreaties in Turkish interests. This is the well-known way in which, ever\r\nsince the world called civilised began, the area of conflict is widened.\r\nIf one plea is eluded or is satisfied, another is found; and so the\r\npeacemakers are at each step checkmated by the warmakers. The Powers of\r\ncentral Europe were immovable, with motives, interests, designs, each of\r\ntheir own. Austria had reasons of irresistible force for keeping peace\r\nwith Russia. A single victory of Russia in Austrian Poland would enable\r\nher to march direct upon Vienna. Austria had no secure alliance with\r\nPrussia; on the contrary, her German rival opposed her on this question,\r\nand was incessantly canvassing the smaller states against her in respect\r\nto it. The French Emperor was said to be revolving a plan for bribing\r\nAustria out of Northern Italy by the gift of Moldavia and Wallachia. All\r\nwas intricate and tortuous. The view in Downing Street soon expanded to\r\nthis, that it would be a shame to England and to France unless the Czar\r\nwere made not only to abandon his demands, and to evacuate the\r\nPrincipalities, but also to renounce some of the stipulations in former\r\ntreaties on which his present arrogant pretensions had been formed. In\r\nthe future, the guarantees for the Christian races should be sought in a\r\ntreaty not between Sultan and Czar, but between the Sultan and the five\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\n                           BRITISH OPINION\r\n\r\nMen in the cabinet and men out of it, some with ardour, others with\r\nacquiescence, approved of war for different reasons, interchangeable in\r\ncontroversial value and cumulative in effect. Some believed, and more\r\npretended to believe, that Turkey abounded in the elements and energies\r\nof self-reform, and insisted that she should have the chance. Others\r\nwere moved by vague general sympathy with a weak power assailed by a\r\nstrong one, and that one, moreover, the same tyrannous strength that\r\nheld an iron heel on the neck of prostrate Poland; that only a few years\r\nbefore had despatched her legions to help Austria against the rising for\r\nfreedom and national right in Hungary; that urged intolerable demands\r\nupon the Sultan for the surrender of the Hungarian refugees. Others\r\nagain counted the power of Russia already exorbitant, and saw in its\r\nextension peril to Europe, and mischief to the interests of England.\r\nRussia on the Danube, they said, means Russia on the Indus. Russia at\r\nConstantinople would mean a complete revolution in the balance of power\r\nin the Mediterranean, and to an alarmed vision, a Russia that had only\r\ncrossed the Pruth was as menacing as if her Cossacks were already\r\nencamped in permanence upon the shores of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nAlong with the anxieties of the Eastern question, ministers were divided\r\nupon the subject of parliamentary reform. Some, including the prime\r\nminister, went with Lord John Russell in desiring to push a Reform bill.\r\nOthers, especially Palmerston, were strongly adverse. Mr. Gladstone\r\nmainly followed the head of the government, but he was still a\r\nconservative, and still member for a tory constituency, and he followed\r\nhis leader rather mechanically and without enthusiasm. Lord Palmerston\r\nwas suspected by some of his colleagues of raising the war-cry in hopes\r\nof drowning the demand for reform. In the middle of December (1853) he\r\nresigned upon reform,[307] but nine days later he withdrew his\r\nresignation and returned. In the interval news of the Russian attack on\r\nthe Turkish fleet at Sinope (November 30) had arrived--an attack\r\njustified by precedent and the rule of war. But public feeling in\r\nEngland had risen to fever; the French Emperor in exacting and\r\nperemptory language had declared that if England did not take joint\r\naction with him in the Black Sea, he would either act alone or else\r\nbring his fleet home. The British cabinet yielded, and came to the\r\ncardinal decision (Dec. 22) to enter the Black Sea. 'I was rather\r\nstunned,' Gladstone wrote to Sidney Herbert next day, 'by yesterday's\r\ncabinet. I have scarcely got my breath again. I told Lord Aberdeen that\r\nI had had wishes that Palmerston were back again on account of the\r\nEastern question.'\r\n\r\nHere is a glimpse of this time:--\r\n\r\n      _Nov. 23, '53._--Cabinet. Reform discussed largely, amicably, and\r\n     satisfactorily on the whole. _Dec. 16._--Hawarden. Off at 9 A.M.\r\n     Astounded by a note from A. Gordon. [Palmerston had resigned the\r\n     day before.] After dinner went to the admiralty, 101/2-11/2, where Lord\r\n     Aberdeen, Newcastle, Graham, and I went over the late events and\r\n     went over the course for to-morrow's cabinet. _Dec. 21._--Called on\r\n     Lord Palmerston, and sat an hour. 22.--Cabinet, 2-71/2, on Eastern\r\n     Question. Palmerston and reform. A day of no small matter for\r\n     reflection. _Jan. 4, 1854._--To Windsor. I was the only guest, and\r\n     thus was promoted to sit by the Queen at dinner. She was most\r\n     gracious, and above all so thoroughly natural.\r\n\r\n                     THE DECISION OF DECEMBER 22\r\n\r\nOn the decision of Dec. 22, Sir Charles Wood says:--\r\n\r\n     We had then a long discussion on the question of occupying the\r\n     Black Sea, as proposed by France, and it seemed to me to be such a\r\n     tissue of confusions that I advocated the simple course of doing\r\n     so. Gladstone could not be persuaded to agree to this, in spite of\r\n     a strong argument of Newcastle's. Gladstone's objection being to\r\n     our being hampered by any engagement. His scheme was that our\r\n     occupying the Black Sea was to be made dependent, in the first\r\n     place, on the Turks having acceded to the Vienna proposals, or at\r\n     any rate to their agreeing to be bound by any basis of peace on\r\n     which the English and French governments agreed. Newcastle and I\r\n     said we thought this would bind us much more to the Turks than if\r\n     we occupied the Black Sea as part of our own measures, adopted for\r\n     our own purposes, and without any engagement to the Turks, under\r\n     which we should be if they accepted our conditions. Gladstone said\r\n     he could be no party to unconditional occupation; so it ended in\r\n     our telling France that we would occupy the Black Sea, that is,\r\n     prevent the passage of any ships or munitions of war by the\r\n     Russians, but that we trusted she would join us in enforcing the\r\n     above condition on the Turks. If they agreed, then we were to\r\n     occupy the Black Sea; if they did not, we were to reconsider the\r\n     question, and then determine what to do. Clarendon saw Walewski,\r\n     who was quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February war was certain. Mr. Gladstone wrote an\r\naccount of a conversation that he had at this time with Lord Aberdeen:--\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 22._--Lord Aberdeen sent for me to-day and informed me that\r\n     Lord Palmerston had been with him to say that he had made up his\r\n     mind to vote for putting off (without entering into the question of\r\n     its merits) the consideration of the Reform bill for the present\r\n     year. [Conversation on Reform.][308]\r\n\r\n     He then asked me whether I did not think that he might himself\r\n     withdraw from office when we came to the declaration of war. All\r\n     along he had been acting against his feelings, but still\r\n     defensively. He did not think that he could regard the offensive in\r\n     the same light, and was disposed to retire. I said that a\r\n     defensive war might involve offensive operations, and that a\r\n     declaration of war placed the case on no new ground of principle.\r\n     It did not make the quarrel, but merely announced it, notifying to\r\n     the world (of itself justifiable) a certain state of facts which\r\n     would have arrived. He said all wars were called or pretended to be\r\n     defensive. I said that if the war was untruly so called, then our\r\n     position was false; but that the war did not become less defensive\r\n     from our declaring it, or from our entering upon offensive\r\n     operations. To retire therefore upon such a declaration, would be\r\n     to retire upon no ground warrantable and conceivable by reason. It\r\n     would not be standing on a principle, whereas any man would require\r\n     a distinct principle to justify him in giving up at this moment the\r\n     service of the crown. He asked: How could he bring himself to fight\r\n     for the Turks? I said we were not fighting for the Turks, but we\r\n     were warning Russia off the forbidden ground. That if, indeed, we\r\n     undertook to put down the Christians under Turkish rule by force,\r\n     then we should be fighting for the Turks; but to this I for one\r\n     could be no party. He said if I saw a way for him to get out, he\r\n     hoped I would mention it to him. I replied that my own views of war\r\n     so much agreed with his, and I felt such a horror of bloodshed,\r\n     that I had thought the matter over incessantly for myself. We\r\n     stand, I said, upon the ground that the Emperor has invaded\r\n     countries not his own, inflicted wrong on Turkey, and what I feel\r\n     much more, most cruel wrong on the wretched inhabitants of the\r\n     Principalities; that war had ensued and was raging with all its\r\n     horrors; that we had procured for the Emperor an offer of\r\n     honourable terms of peace which he had refused; that we were not\r\n     going to extend the conflagration (but I had to correct myself as\r\n     to the Baltic), but to apply more power for its extinction, and\r\n     this I hoped in conjunction with all the great Powers of Europe.\r\n     That I, for one, could not shoulder the musket against the\r\n     Christian subjects of the Sultan, and must there take my stand.\r\n     (Not even, I had already told him, if he agreed to such a course,\r\n     could I bind myself to follow him in it.) He said Granville and\r\n     Wood had spoken to him in the same sense. I added that S. Herbert\r\n     and Graham probably would adhere; perhaps Argyll and Molesworth,\r\n     and even others might be added.\r\n\r\n                       LORD ABERDEEN'S MISGIVINGS\r\n\r\n     Ellice had been with him and told him that J. Russell and\r\n     Palmerston were preparing to contend for his place. Ellice himself,\r\n     deprecating Lord Aberdeen's retirement, anticipated that if it took\r\n     place Lord Palmerston would get the best of it, and drive Lord John\r\n     out of the field by means of his war popularity, though Lord John\r\n     had made the speech of Friday to put himself up in this point of\r\n     view with the country.\r\n\r\n     In consequence of what I had said to him about Newcastle, he\r\n     [Aberdeen] had watched him, and had told the Queen to look to him\r\n     as her minister at some period or other; which, though afraid of\r\n     him (as well as of me) about Church matters, she was prepared to\r\n     do. I said I had not changed my opinion of Newcastle as he had done\r\n     of Lord John Russell, but I had been disappointed and pained at the\r\n     recent course of his opinions about the matter of the war. At my\r\n     house last Wednesday he [Newcastle] declared openly for putting\r\n     down by force the Christians of European Turkey. Yes, Lord Aberdeen\r\n     replied; but he thought him the description of man who would\r\n     discharge well the duties of that office. In this I agree.[309]\r\n\r\nA few days later (March 3) Lord John Russell, by way of appeasing\r\nAberdeen's incessant self-reproach, told him that the only course that\r\ncould have prevented war would have been to counsel the Turks to\r\nacquiesce, and not to allow the British fleet to quit Malta. 'But that\r\nwas a course,' Lord John continued, 'to which Lansdowne, Palmerston,\r\nClarendon, Newcastle, and I would not have consented; so that you would\r\nonly have broken up your government if you had insisted upon it.' Then\r\nthe speaker added his belief that the Czar, even after the Turk's\r\nacquiescence and submission, if we could have secured so much, would\r\nhave given the Sultan six months' respite, and no more. None of these\r\narguments ever eased the mind of Lord Aberdeen. Even in his last\r\ninterview with the departing ambassador of the Czar, he told him how\r\nbitterly he regretted, first, the original despatch of the fleet from\r\nMalta to Besika Bay (July 1853); and second that he had not sent Lord\r\nGranville to St. Petersburg immediately on the failure of Menschikoff at\r\nConstantinople (May 1853), in order to carry on personal negotiations\r\nwith the Emperor.[310]\r\n\r\nAn ultimatum demanding the evacuation of the Principalities was\r\ndespatched to St. Petersburg by England and France, the Czar kept a\r\nhaughty silence, and at the end of March war was declared. In the event\r\nthe Principalities were evacuated a couple of months later, but the\r\nstate of war continued. On September 14, English, French, and Turkish\r\ntroops disembarked on the shores of the Crimea, and on the 20th of the\r\nmonth was fought the battle of the Alma. 'I cannot help repeating to\r\nyou,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Palmerston (Oct. 4, 1854), 'which I\r\nhope you will forgive, the thanks I offered at an earlier period, for\r\nthe manner in which you urged--when we were amidst many temptations to\r\nfar more embarrassing and less effective proceedings--the duty of\r\nconcentrating our strokes upon the heart and centre of the war at\r\nSebastopol.'[311] In the same month Bright wrote the solid, wise, and\r\nnoble letter that brought him so much obloquy then, and stands as one of\r\nthe memorials of his fame now.[312] Mr. Gladstone wrote to his brother\r\nRobertson upon it:--\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 7, 1854._--I thought Bright's letter both an able and a manly\r\n     one, and though I cannot go his lengths, I respect and sympathise\r\n     with the spirit in which it originated. I think he should draw a\r\n     distinction between petty meddlings of our own, or interferences\r\n     for selfish purposes, and an operation like this which really is in\r\n     support of the public law of Europe. I agree with him in some of\r\n     the retrospective part of his letter.\r\n\r\nThen came the dark days of the Crimean winter.\r\n\r\n                        DID THE CABINET DRIFT?\r\n\r\nIn his very deliberate vindication of the policy of the Crimean war\r\ncomposed in 1887, Mr. Gladstone warmly denies either that the ship of\r\nstate drifted instead of being steered, or that the cabinet was in\r\ncontinual conflict with itself at successive stages of the\r\nnegotiation.[313] He had witnessed, he declares, much more of sharp or\r\nwarm argument in every other of the seven cabinets to which he\r\nbelonged.[314] In 1881 he said to the present writer: 'As a member of\r\nthe Aberdeen cabinet I never can admit that divided opinions in that\r\ncabinet led to hesitating action, or brought on the war. I do not mean\r\nthat all were always and on all points of the same mind. But I have\r\nknown much sharper divisions in a cabinet that has worked a great\r\nquestion honourably and energetically, and I should confidently say,\r\nwhether the negotiations were well or ill conducted, that considering\r\ntheir great difficulty they were worked with little and not much\r\nconflict. It must be borne in mind that Lord Aberdeen subsequently\r\ndeveloped opinions that were widely severed from those that had guided\r\nus, but these never appeared in the cabinet or at the time.' Still he\r\nadmits that this practical harmony could much less truly be affirmed of\r\nthe four ministers especially concerned with foreign affairs;[315] that\r\nis to say, of the only ministers whose discussions mattered. It is\r\ncertainly impossible to contend that Aberdeen was not in pretty\r\ncontinual conflict, strong and marked though not heated, with these\r\nthree main coadjutors. Whether it be true to say that the cabinet\r\ndrifted, depends on the precise meaning of a word. It is undoubtedly\r\ntrue that it steered a course bringing the ship into waters that the\r\ncaptain most eagerly wished to avoid, and each tack carried it farther\r\naway from the expected haven. Winds and waves were too many for them. We\r\nmay perhaps agree with Mr. Gladstone that as it was feeling rather than\r\nargument that raised the Crimean war into popularity, so it is feeling\r\nand not argument that has plunged it into the 'abyss of odium.' When we\r\ncome to a period twenty years after this war was over, we shall see that\r\nMr. Gladstone found out how little had time changed the public temper,\r\nhow little had events taught their lesson.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[296] In 1772 Burke had said that he did not wish well to Turkey, for\r\nany people but the Turks, situated as they are, would have been\r\ncultivated in three hundred years; yet they grow more gross in the very\r\nnative soil of civility and refinement. But he did not expect to live to\r\nsee the Turkish barbarian civilised by the Russian.--_Corr._ i. p. 402.\r\n\r\n[297] To Mrs. Gladstone, Jan. 3, 1863: 'In the evenings I have leisure.\r\nMuch of it I have been spending in reading Kinglake's book, which\r\ntouches very nearly, and not agreeably or justly, the character of Lord\r\nAberdeen and his government. I am afraid Newcastle blabbed on what took\r\nplace, and that his blabbing was much coloured with egotism.

MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last waves of the tide of reform that had been flowing for a score\r\nof years, now at length reached the two ancient universities. The\r\nTractarian revival with all its intense pre-occupations had given the\r\nantique Oxford a respite, but the hour struck, and the final effort of\r\nthe expiring whigs in their closing days of power was the summons to\r\nOxford and Cambridge to set their houses in order. Oxford had been\r\nturned into the battle-field on which contending parties in the church\r\nhad at her expense fought for mastery. The result was curious. The\r\nnature of the theological struggle, by quickening mind within the\r\nuniversity, had roused new forces; the antagonism between anglo-catholic\r\nand puritan helped, as it had done two centuries before, to breed the\r\nlatitudinarian; a rising school in the sphere of thought and criticism\r\nrapidly made themselves an active party in the sphere of affairs; and\r\nMr. Gladstone found himself forced to do the work of the very\r\nliberalism which his own theological leaders and allies had first\r\norganised themselves to beat down and extinguish.\r\n\r\n                    FIRST OXFORD COMMISSION\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Lord John Russell, worked upon by a persevering minority in\r\nOxford, startled the House of Commons, delighted the liberals, and\r\nangered and dismayed the authorities of the powerful corporations thus\r\nimpugned, by the announcement of a commission under the crown to inquire\r\ninto their discipline, state, and revenues, and to report whether any\r\naction by crown and parliament could further promote the interests of\r\nreligion and sound learning in these venerable shrines. This was the\r\nfirst step in a long journey towards the nationalisation of the\r\nuniversities, and the disestablishment of the church of England in what\r\nseemed the best fortified of all her strongholds.\r\n\r\nAfter elaborate correspondence with both liberal and tory sections in\r\nOxford, Mr. Gladstone rose in his place and denounced the proposed\r\ncommission as probably against the law, and certainly odious in the eye\r\nof the constitution. He undertook to tear in tatters the various modern\r\nprecedents advanced by the government for their purpose; scouted the\r\nalleged visitorial power of the crown; insisted that it would blight\r\nfuture munificence; argued that defective instruction with freedom and\r\nself-government would, in the choice of evils, be better than the most\r\nperfect mechanism secured by parliamentary interference; admitted that\r\nwhat the universities had done for learning was perhaps less than it\r\nmight have been, but they had done as much as answered the circumstances\r\nand exigencies of the country. When we looked at the lawyers, the\r\ndivines, the statesmen of England, even if some might judge them\r\ninferior in mere scholastic and technical acquirements, why need we be\r\nashamed of the cradles in which they were mainly nurtured? He closed\r\nwith a triumphant and moving reference to Peel (dead a fortnight\r\nbefore), the most distinguished son of Oxford in the present century,\r\nand beyond all other men the high representative and the true type of\r\nthe genius of the British House of Commons.[316] In truth no worse case\r\nwas ever more strongly argued, and fortunately the speech is to be\r\nrecorded as the last manifesto, on a high theme and on a broad scale, of\r\nthat toryism from which this wonderful pilgrim had started on his\r\nshining progress. It is just to add that the party in Oxford who\r\nresisted the commission was also the party most opposed to Mr.\r\nGladstone, and further that the view of the crown having no right to\r\nissue such a commission _in invitos_ was shared with him by Sir Robert\r\nPeel.[317] Of this debate, Arthur Stanley (a strong supporter of the\r\nmeasure), tells us: 'The ministerial speeches were very feeble....\r\nGladstone's was very powerful; he said, in the most effective manner,\r\nanything which could be said against the commission. His allusion to\r\nPeel was very touching, and the House responded to it by profound and\r\nsympathetic silence.... Heywood's closing speech was happily drowned in\r\nthe roar of \"Divide,\" so that nothing could be heard save the name of\r\n\"Cardinal Wolsey\" thrice repeated.'[318] The final division was taken on\r\nthe question of the adjournment, when the government had a majority of\r\n22. (July 18, 1850.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                         REPORT OF THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\nIn Oxford the party of 'organised torpor' did not yield without a\r\nstruggle. They were clamorous on the sanctity of property; contemptuous\r\nof the doctrine of the rights of parliament over national domains; and\r\nprotestant collegians subsisting on ancient Roman catholic endowments\r\nedified the world on the iniquity of setting aside the pious founder.\r\nThey submitted an elaborate case to the most eminent counsel of the day,\r\nand counsel advised that the commission was not constitutional, not\r\nlegal, and not such as the members of the university were bound to obey.\r\nThe question of duty apart from legal obligation the lawyers did not\r\nanswer, but they suggested that a petition might be addressed to the\r\ncrown, praying that the instrument might be cancelled. The petition was\r\nduly prepared, and duly made no difference. Many of the academic\r\nauthorities were recalcitrant, but this made no difference either, nor\r\ndid the Bishop of Exeter's hot declaration that the proceeding had 'no\r\nparallel since the fatal attempt of King James II. to subject the\r\ncolleges to his unhallowed control.' The commissioners, of whom Tait and\r\nJeune seem to have been the leading spirits, with Stanley and Mr.\r\nGoldwin Smith for secretaries, conducted their operations with tact,\r\ngood sense, and zeal. At the end of two years (April 1852) the inquiry\r\nwas completed and the report made public--one of the high landmarks in\r\nthe history of our modern English life and growth. 'When you consider,'\r\nStanley said to Jowett, 'the den of lions through which the raw material\r\nhad to be dragged, much will be excused. In fact the great work was to\r\nfinish it at all. There is a harsh, unfriendly tone about the whole\r\nwhich ought, under better circumstances, to have been avoided, but which\r\nmay, perhaps, have the advantage of propitiating the radicals.'[319]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone thought it one of the ablest productions submitted in his\r\nrecollection to parliament, but the proposals of change too manifold and\r\ncomplicated. The evidence he found more moderate and less sweeping in\r\ntone than the report, but it only deepened his conviction of the\r\nnecessity of important and, above all, early changes. He did not cease\r\nurging his friends at Oxford to make use of this golden opportunity for\r\nreforming the university from within, and warning them that delay would\r\nbe dearly purchased.[320] 'Gladstone's connection with Oxford,' said Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis, 'is now exercising a singular influence upon the politics\r\nof the university. Most of his high church supporters stick to him, and\r\n(insomuch as it is difficult to struggle against the current) he is\r\nliberalising them, instead of their torifying him. He is giving them a\r\npush forwards instead of their giving him a pull backwards.'[321]\r\n\r\nThe originators of the commission were no longer in office, but things\r\nhad gone too far for their successors to burke what had been done.[322]\r\nThe Derby government put into the Queen's speech, in November (1852), a\r\nparagraph informing parliament that the universities had been invited to\r\nexamine the recommendations of the report. After a year's time had been\r\ngiven them to consider, it became the duty of the Aberdeen government to\r\nframe a bill. The charge fell upon Mr. Gladstone as member for Oxford,\r\nand in the late autumn of 1853 he set to work. In none of the\r\nenterprises of his life was he more industrious or energetic. Before the\r\nmiddle of December he forwarded to Lord John Russell what he called a\r\nrude draft, but the rude draft contained the kernel of the plan that was\r\nultimately carried, with a suggestion even of the names of the\r\ncommissioners to whom operations were to be confided. 'It is marvellous\r\nto me,' wrote Dr. Jeune to him (Dec. 21, 1853), 'how you can give\r\nattention so minute to university affairs at such a crisis. Do great\r\nthings become to great men from the force of habit, what their ordinary\r\ncares are to ordinary persons?' As he began, so he advanced, listening\r\nto everybody, arguing with everybody, flexible, persistent, clear,\r\npractical, fervid, unconquerable. 'I fear,' Lord John Russell wrote to\r\nhim (March 27), 'my mind is exclusively occupied with the war and the\r\nReform bill, and yours with university reform.' Perhaps, unluckily for\r\nthe country, this was true. 'My whole heart is in the Oxford bill,' Mr.\r\nGladstone writes (March 29); 'it is my consolation under the pain with\r\nwhich I view the character my office [the exchequer] is assuming under\r\nthe circumstances of war.' 'Gladstone has been surprising everybody\r\nhere,' writes a conspicuous high churchman from Oxford, 'by the ubiquity\r\nof his correspondence. Three-fourths of the colleges have been in\r\ncommunication with him, on various parts of the bill more or less\r\naffecting themselves. He answers everybody by return of post, fully and\r\nat length, quite entering into their case, and showing the greatest\r\nacquaintance with it.'[323] 'As one of your burgesses,' he told them, 'I\r\nstand upon the line that divides Oxford from the outer world, and as a\r\nsentinel I cry out to tell what I see from that position.' What he saw\r\nwas that if this bill were thrown out, no other half so favourable would\r\never again be brought in.\r\n\r\n                           THE BILL FRAMED\r\n\r\nThe scheme accepted by the cabinet was in essentials Mr. Gladstone's\r\nown. Jowett at the earliest stage sent him a comprehensive plan, and\r\nsoon after, saw Lord John (Jan. 6). 'I must own,' writes the latter to\r\nGladstone, 'I was much struck by the clearness and completeness of his\r\nviews.' The difference between Jowett's plan and Mr. Gladstone's was on\r\nthe highly important point of machinery. Jowett, who all his life had a\r\nweakness for getting and keeping authority into his own hands, or the\r\nhands of those whom he could influence, contended that after parliament\r\nhad settled principles, Oxford itself could be trusted to settle details\r\nfar better than a little body of great personages from outside,\r\nunacquainted with special wants and special interests. Mr. Gladstone, on\r\nthe other hand, invented the idea of an executive commission with\r\nstatutory powers. The two plans were printed and circulated, and the\r\nbalance of opinion in the cabinet went decisively for Mr. Gladstone's\r\nscheme. The discussion between him and Jowett, ranging over the whole\r\nfield of the bill, was maintained until its actual production, in many\r\ninterviews and much correspondence. In drawing the clauses Mr. Gladstone\r\nreceived the help of Bethell, the solicitor-general, at whose suggestion\r\nPhillimore and Thring were called in for further aid in what was\r\nundoubtedly a task of exceptional difficulty. The process brought into\r\nclearer light the truth discerned by Mr. Gladstone from the first, that\r\nthe enormous number of diverse institutions that had grown up in Oxford\r\nmade resort to what he called sub-legislation inevitable; that is to\r\nsay, they were too complex for parliament, and could only be dealt with\r\nby delegation to executive act.\r\n\r\nIt is untrue to say that Oxford as a place of education had no influence\r\non the mind of the country; it had immense influence, but that influence\r\nwas exactly what it ought not to have been. Instead of stimulating it\r\nchecked, instead of expanding it stereotyped. Even for the church it\r\nhad failed to bring unity, for it was from Oxford that the opinions had\r\nsprung that seemed to be rending the church in twain. The regeneration\r\nintroduced by this momentous measure has been overlaid by the strata of\r\nsubsequent reforms. Enough to say that the objects obtained were the\r\ndeposition of the fossils and drones, and a renovated constitution on\r\nthe representative principle for the governing body; the wakening of a\r\nhuge mass of sleeping endowments; the bestowal of college emoluments\r\nonly on excellence tested by competition, and associated with active\r\nduties; the reorganisation or re-creation of professorial teaching; the\r\nremoval of local preferences and restrictions. Beyond these aspects of\r\nreform, Mr. Gladstone was eager for the proposed right to establish\r\nprivate halls, as a change calculated to extend the numbers and strength\r\nof the university, and as settling the much disputed question, whether\r\nthe scale of living could not be reduced, and university education\r\nbrought within reach of classes of moderate means. These hopes proved to\r\nbe exaggerated, but they illustrate his constant and lifelong interest\r\nin the widest possible diffusion of all good things in the world from\r\nuniversity training down to a Cook's tour.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone seems to have pressed his draftsmen hard, as he sometimes\r\ndid. Bethell returning to him 'the _disjecta membra_ of this unfortunate\r\nbill,' tells him that he is too deeply attached to him to care for a few\r\nmarks of impatience, and adds, 'write a few kind words to Phillimore,\r\nfor he really loves you and feels this matter deeply.' Oxford, scene of\r\nso many agitations for a score of years past, was once more seized with\r\nconsternation, stupefaction, enthusiasm. A few private copies of the\r\ndraft were sent down from London for criticism. On the vice-chancellor\r\nit left 'an impression of sorrow and sad anticipations'; it opened\r\ndeplorable prospects for the university, for the church, for religion,\r\nfor righteousness. The dean of Christ Church thought it not merely\r\ninexpedient, but unjust and tyrannical. Jowett, on the other hand, was\r\nconvinced that it must satisfy all reasonable reformers, and added\r\nemphatically in writing to Mr. Gladstone, 'It is to yourself and Lord\r\nJohn that the university will be indebted for the greatest boon that it\r\nhas ever received.' After the introduction of the bill by Lord John\r\nRussell, the obscurantists made a final effort to call down one of their\r\nold pelting hailstorms. A petition against the bill was submitted to\r\nconvocation; happily it passed by a majority of no more than two.\r\n\r\n                           SECOND READING\r\n\r\nAt length the blessed day of the second reading came. The ever zealous\r\nArthur Stanley was present. 'A superb speech from Gladstone,' he\r\nrecords, 'in which, for the first time, all the arguments from our\r\nreport were worked up in the most effective manner. He vainly\r\nendeavoured to reconcile his present with his former position. But, with\r\nthis exception, I listened to his speech with the greatest delight....\r\nTo behold one's old enemies slaughtered before one's face with the most\r\nirresistible weapons was quite intoxicating. One great charm of his\r\nspeaking is its exceeding good-humour. There is great vehemence but no\r\nbitterness.'[324] An excellent criticism of many, perhaps most, of his\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n'It must ever be borne in mind,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord John at the\r\noutset, 'with respect to our old universities that history, law, and\r\nusage with them form such a manifold, diversified, and complex mass,\r\nthat it is not one subject but a world of subjects that we have to deal\r\nwith in approaching them.' And he pointed out that if any clever lawyer\r\nsuch as Butt or Cairns were employed to oppose the bill systematically,\r\ndebate would run to such lengths as to make it hopeless. This was a\r\npoint of view that Mr. Gladstone's more exacting and abstract critics\r\nnow, and many another time, forgot: they forgot that, whatever else you\r\nmay say of a bill, after all it is a thing that is to be carried through\r\nparliament. Everybody had views of his own. A characteristic\r\nillustration of Mr. Gladstone's temper in the arduous work of practical\r\nlegislation to which so much of the energies of his life was devoted, is\r\nworth giving here from a letter of this date to Burgon of Oriel. Nobody\r\nanswers better to the rare combination, in Bacon's words, of a 'glorious\r\nnature that doth put life into business, with a solid and sober nature\r\nthat hath as much of the ballast as of the sail':--\r\n\r\n     Sometimes it may be necessary in dealing with a very ancient\r\n     institution to make terms, as it were, between such an institution\r\n     and the actual spirit of the age. This may be in certain\r\n     circumstances a necessary, but it can never be a satisfactory,\r\n     process. It is driving a bargain, and somewhat of a wretched\r\n     bargain. But I really do not find or feel that this is the case now\r\n     before us. In that case, my view, right or wrong, is this: that\r\n     Oxford is far behind her duties or capabilities, not because her\r\n     working men work so little, but because so large a proportion of\r\n     her children do not work at all, so large a proportion of her\r\n     resources remains practically dormant, and her present constitution\r\n     is so ill-adapted to developing her real but latent powers. What I\r\n     therefore anticipate is not the weakening of her distinctive\r\n     principles, not the diminution of her labour, already great, that\r\n     she discharges for the church and for the land, but a great\r\n     expansion, a great invigoration, a great increase of her numbers, a\r\n     still greater increase of her moral force, and of her hold upon the\r\n     heart and mind of the country.\r\n\r\n                        ADMISSION OF DISSENTERS\r\n\r\nPusey seems to have talked of the university as ruined and overthrown by\r\na parricidal hand; Oxford would be lost to the church; she would have to\r\ntake refuge in colleges away from the university. Oxford had now\r\nreceived its death-blow from Mr. Gladstone and the government to which\r\nhe belonged, and he could no longer support at election times the worker\r\nof such evil, and must return to that inactivity in things political,\r\nfrom which only love and confidence for Mr. Gladstone had roused him.\r\n'Personally,' the good man adds, 'I must always love you.' To Pusey, and\r\nto all who poured reproach upon him from this side, Mr. Gladstone\r\nreplied with inexhaustible patience. He never denied that parliamentary\r\nintervention was an evil, but he submitted to it in order to avert\r\ngreater evil. 'If the church of England has not strength enough to keep\r\nupright, this will soon appear in the troubles of emancipated Oxford: if\r\nshe has, it will come out to the joy of us all in the immensely\r\naugmented energy and power of the university for good. If Germanism and\r\nArnoldism are now to carry the day at Oxford (I mean supposing the bill\r\nis carried into law), they will carry it fairly; let them win and wear\r\nher (God forbid, however); but if she has a heart true to the faith her\r\nhand will be stronger ten times over than it has been heretofore, in\r\ndoing battle.... Nor am I saddened by the pamphlet of a certain Mr. ----\r\nwhich I have been reading to-day. It has more violence than venom, and\r\nalso much more violence than strength. I often feel how hard it is on\r\ndivines to be accused of treachery and baseness, because they do not,\r\nlike _us_, get it every day and so become case-hardened against it.'\r\n\r\nIn parliament the craft laboured heavily in cross-seas. 'I have never\r\nknown,' says its pilot, 'a measure so foolishly discussed in committee.'\r\nNor was oil cast upon the waters by its friends. By the end of May Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord John saw that they must take in canvas. At this point\r\na new storm broke. It was impossible that a measure on such a subject\r\ncould fail to awaken the ever ready quarrel between the two camps into\r\nwhich the English establishment, for so many generations, has so\r\nunhappily divided the life of the nation. From the first, the protestant\r\ndissenters had been extremely sore at the absence from the bill of any\r\nprovision for their admission to the remodelled university. Bright, the\r\nmost illustrious of them, told the House of Commons that he did not care\r\nwhether so pusillanimous and tinkering an affair as this was passed or\r\nnot. Dissenters, he said with scorn, are expected always to manifest too\r\nmuch of those inestimable qualities which are spoken of in the Epistle\r\nto the Corinthians: 'To hope all things, to believe all things, and to\r\nendure all things.'\r\n\r\nMore discredit than he deserved fell upon Mr. Gladstone for this\r\nobnoxious defect. In announcing the commission of inquiry four years\r\nbefore, Lord John as prime minister had expressly said that the\r\nimprovement of the universities should be treated as a subject by\r\nitself, and that the admission of dissenters ought to be reserved for\r\nfuture and separate consideration. Writing to Mr. Gladstone (Jan. 1854)\r\nhe said, 'I do not want to stir the question in this bill,' but he\r\nwould support a proposal in a separate bill by which the halls might be\r\nthe means of admitting dissenters. Mr. Gladstone himself professed to\r\ntake no strong line either way; but in a parliamentary case of this kind\r\nto take no line is not materially different from a line in effect\r\nunfriendly. Arthur Stanley pressed him as hard as he could. 'Justice to\r\nthe university,' said Mr. Gladstone in reply, 'demands that it should be\r\nallowed to consider the question for itself.... Indeed, while I believe\r\nthat the admission of dissenters without the breaking up of the\r\nreligious teaching and the government of the university would be a great\r\ngood, I am also of opinion that to give effect to that measure by\r\nforcible intervention of parliament would be a great evil. Whether it is\r\nan evil that must some day or other be encountered, the time has not\r\nyet, I think, arrived for determining.' The letter concludes with a\r\nremark of curious bearing upon the temper of that age. 'The very words,'\r\nhe says to Stanley, 'which you have let fall upon your paper--\"Roman\r\ncatholics\"--used in this connection, were enough to burn it through and\r\nthrough, considering we have _a parliament which, were the measure of\r\n1829 not law at this moment, would I think probably refuse to make it\r\nlaw_.' There is no reason to think this an erroneous view. Perhaps it\r\nwould not be extravagant even to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Gladstone called 'the evil of parliamentary interference' did\r\nnot tarry, and on the report stage of the bill, a clause removing the\r\ntheological test at matriculation was carried (June 22) against the\r\ngovernment by ninety-one. The size of the majority and the diversified\r\nmaterial of which it was composed left the government no option but to\r\nyield. 'Parliament having now unhappily determined to legislate upon the\r\nsubject,' Mr. Gladstone writes to the provost of Oriel, 'it seems to me,\r\nI may add it seems to my colleagues, best for the interests of the\r\nuniversity that we should now make some endeavour to settle the whole\r\nquestion and so preclude, if we can, any pretext for renewed agitation.'\r\n'The basis of that settlement,' he went on in a formula which he\r\ntenaciously reiterated to all his correspondents, and which is a\r\nlandmark in the long history of his dealing with the question, 'should\r\nbe that the whole teaching and governing function in the university and\r\nin the colleges, halls, and private halls, should be retained, as now,\r\nin the church of England, but that everything outside the governing and\r\nteaching functions, whether in the way of degrees, honours, or\r\nemoluments, should be left open.' The new clause he described as 'one of\r\nthose incomplete arrangements that seem to suit the practical habits of\r\nthis country, and which by taking the edge off a matter of complaint,\r\nare often found virtually to dispose of it for a length of time.' In the\r\nend the church of England test was removed, not only on admission to the\r\nuniversity, but from the bachelor's degree. Tests in other forms\r\nremained, as we shall in good time perceive. 'We have proceeded,' Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote, 'in the full belief that the means of applying a church\r\ntest to fellowships in colleges are clear and ample.' So they were, and\r\nso remained, until seventeen years later in the life of an\r\nadministration of his own the obnoxious fetter was struck off.\r\n\r\n                       MR. DISRAELI ON THE BILL\r\n\r\nThe debates did not close without at least one characteristic\r\nmasterpiece from Mr. Disraeli. He had not taken a division on the second\r\nreading, but he executed with entire gravity all the regulation\r\nmanoeuvres of opposition, and his appearance on the page of Hansard\r\nrelieves a dull discussion. If government, he asked, could defer a\r\nreform of the constitution (referring to the withdrawal of Lord John's\r\nbill) why should they hurry to reform the universities? The talk about\r\nthe erudite professors of Germany as so superior to Oxford was nonsense.\r\nThe great men of Germany became professors only because they could not\r\nbecome members of parliament. 'We, on the contrary, are a nation of\r\naction, and you may depend upon it, that though you may give an Oxford\r\nprofessor two thousand a year instead of two hundred, still ambition in\r\nEngland will look to public life and to the House of Commons, and not to\r\nprofessors' chairs.' The moment the revolution of 1848 gave the German\r\nprofessors a chance, see how they rushed into political conventions and\r\ngrasped administrative offices. Again, the principle of the bill was the\r\nlaying of an unhallowed hand upon the ark of the universities, and wore\r\nin effect the hideous aspect of the never-to-be-forgotten appropriation\r\nclause. If he were asked whether he would rather have Oxford free with\r\nall its imperfections, or an Oxford without imperfections but under the\r\ncontrol of the government, he would reply, 'Give me Oxford free and\r\nindependent, with all its anomalies and imperfections.' An excellently\r\nworded but amusingly irrelevant passage about Voltaire and Rousseau, and\r\nthe land that was enlightened by the one and inflamed by the other,\r\nbrought the curious performance to a solemn close. High fantastic\r\ntrifling of this sort, though it may divert a later generation to whose\r\nlegislative bills it can do no harm, helps to explain the deep disfavour\r\nwith which Disraeli was regarded by his severe and strenuous opponent.\r\n\r\n'The admiration of posterity,' Dr. Jeune wrote to Mr. Gladstone, 'would\r\nbe greatly increased if men hereafter could know what wisdom, what\r\nfirmness, what temper, what labour your success has required.' More than\r\nthis, it was notorious that Mr. Gladstone was bravely risking his seat.\r\nThis side of the matter Jeune made plain to him. 'Had I foreseen in\r\n1847,' replied Mr. Gladstone (_Broadstairs_, Aug. 26, 1854), 'that\r\nchurch controversies which I then hoped were on the decline, were really\r\nabout to assume a fiercer glare and a wider range than they had done\r\nbefore, I should not have been presumptuous enough to face the\r\ncontingencies of such a seat at such a time.' As things stood he was\r\nbound to hold on. With dauntless confidence that never failed him, he\r\nwas convinced that no long time would suffice to scatter the bugbears,\r\nand the bill would be nothing but a source of strength to any one\r\nstanding in reputed connection with it. To Dr. Jeune when the battle was\r\nover he expresses 'his warm sense of the great encouragement and solid\r\nadvantage which at every stage he had derived from his singularly ready\r\nand able help.' To Jowett and Goldwin Smith he acknowledged a hardly\r\nlower degree of obligation. The last twenty years, wrote a shrewd and\r\nexpert sage in 1866, 'have seen more improvement in the temper and\r\nteaching of Oxford than the three centuries since the Reformation. This\r\nhas undoubtedly been vastly promoted by the Reform bill of 1854, or at\r\nleast by one enactment in it, the abolition of close fellowships, which\r\nhas done more for us than all the other enactments of the measure put\r\ntogether.'[325] 'The indirect effects,' says the same writer in words of\r\npregnant praise, 'in stimulating the spirit of improvement among us,\r\nhave been no less important than the specific reforms enacted by\r\nit.'[326]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                       ANOTHER FAR-REACHING CHANGE\r\n\r\nAnother of the most far-reaching changes of this era of reform affected\r\nthe civil service. J. S. Mill, then himself an official at the India\r\nHouse, did not hesitate 'to hail the plan of throwing open the civil\r\nservice to competition as one of the greatest improvements in public\r\naffairs ever proposed by a government.' On the system then reigning,\r\ncivil employment under the crown was in all the offices the result of\r\npatronage, though in some, and those not the more important of them,\r\nnominees were partially tested by qualifying examination and periods of\r\nprobation. The eminent men who held what were called the staff\r\nappointments in the service--the Merivales, Taylors, Farrers--were\r\nintroduced from without, with the obvious implication that either the\r\ncivil service trained up within its own ranks a poor breed, or else that\r\nthe meritorious men were discouraged and kept back by the sight of\r\nprizes falling to outsiders. Mr. Gladstone was not slow to point out\r\nthat the existing system if it brought eminent men in, had driven men\r\nlike Manning and Spedding out. What patronage meant is forcibly\r\ndescribed in a private memorandum of a leading reformer, preserved by\r\nMr. Gladstone among his papers on this subject. 'The existing corps of\r\ncivil servants,' says the writer, 'do not like the new plan, because the\r\nintroduction of well-educated, active men, will force them to bestir\r\nthemselves, and because they cannot hope to get their own ill-educated\r\nsons appointed under the new system. _The old established political\r\nfamilies habitually batten on the public patronage_--their sons\r\nlegitimate and illegitimate, their relatives and dependents of every\r\ndegree, are provided for by the score. Besides the adventuring\r\ndisreputable class of members of parliament, who make God knows what use\r\nof the patronage, a large number of borough members are mainly dependent\r\nupon it for their seats. What, for instance, are the members to do who\r\nhave been sent down by the patronage secretary to contest boroughs in\r\nthe interest of the government, and who are pledged twenty deep to their\r\nconstituents?'\r\n\r\nThe foreign office had undergone, some years before, a thorough\r\nreconstruction by Lord Palmerston, who, though very cool to\r\nconstitutional reform, was assiduous and exacting in the forms of public\r\nbusiness, not least so in the vital matter of a strong, plain, bold\r\nhandwriting. Revision had been attempted in various departments before\r\nMr. Gladstone went to the exchequer, and a spirit of improvement was in\r\nthe air. Lowe, beginning his official career as one of the secretaries\r\nof the board of control, had procured the insertion in the India bill of\r\n1853 of a provision throwing open the great service of India to\r\ncompetition for all British-born subjects, and he was a vigorous\r\nadvocate of a general extension of the principle.[327] It was the\r\nconditions common to all the public establishments that called for\r\nrevision, and the foundations for reform were laid in a report by\r\nNorthcote and Sir Charles Trevelyan (November 1853), prepared for Mr.\r\nGladstone at his request, recommending two propositions, so familiarised\r\nto us to-day as to seem like primordial elements of the British\r\nconstitution. One was, that access to the public service should be\r\nthrough the door of a competitive examination; the other, that for\r\nconducting these examinations a central board should be constituted. The\r\neffect of such a change has been enormous not only on the efficiency of\r\nthe service, but on the education of the country, and by a thousand\r\nindirect influences, raising and strengthening the social feeling for\r\nthe immortal maxim that the career should be open to the talents. The\r\nlazy doctrine that men are much of a muchness gave way to a higher\r\nrespect for merit and to more effectual standards of competency.\r\n\r\n                         OLD SYSTEM AND NEW\r\n\r\nThe reform was not achieved without a battle. The whole case was argued\r\nby Mr. Gladstone in a letter to Lord John Russell of incomparable\r\ntrenchancy and force, one of the best specimens of the writer at his\r\nbest, and only not worth reproducing here, because the case has long\r\nbeen finished.[328] Lord John (Jan. 20) wrote to him curtly in reply, 'I\r\nhope no change will be made, and I certainly must protest against it.'\r\nIn reply to even a second assault, he remained quite unconvinced. At\r\npresent, he said, the Queen appointed the ministers, and the ministers\r\nthe subordinates; in future the board of examiners would be in the place\r\nof the Queen. Our institutions would be as nearly republican as\r\npossible, and the new spirit of the public offices would not be loyalty\r\nbut republicanism! As one of Lord John's kindred spirits declared, 'The\r\nmore the civil service is recruited from the lower classes, the less\r\nwill it be sought after by the higher, until at last the aristocracy\r\nwill be altogether dissociated from the permanent civil service of the\r\ncountry.' How could the country go on with a democratic civil service by\r\nthe side of an aristocratic legislature?[329] This was just the spirit\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone loathed. To Graham he wrote (Jan. 3, 1854), 'I do not\r\nwant any pledges as to details; what I seek is your countenance and\r\nfavour in an endeavour to introduce to the cabinet a proposal that we\r\nshould give our sanction to the principle that in every case where a\r\nsatisfactory test of a defined and palpable nature can be furnished, the\r\npublic service shall be laid open to personal merit.... This is _my_\r\ncontribution to parliamentary reform.' On January 26 (1854) the cabinet\r\nwas chiefly occupied by Mr. Gladstone's proposition, and after a long\r\ndiscussion his plan was adopted. When reformers more ardent than\r\naccurate insisted in later years that it was the aristocracy who kept\r\npatronage, Mr. Gladstone reminded the House, 'No cabinet could have been\r\nmore aristocratically composed than that over which Lord Aberdeen\r\npresided. I myself was the only one of fifteen noblemen and gentlemen\r\nwho composed it, who could not fairly be said to belong to that class.'\r\nYet it was this cabinet that conceived and matured a plan for the\r\nsurrender of all its patronage. There for the moment, in spite of all\r\nhis vigour and resolution, the reform was arrested. Time did not change\r\nhim. In November he wrote to Trevelyan: 'My own opinions are more and\r\nmore in favour of the plan of competition. I do not mean that they can\r\nbe more in its favour as a principle, than they were when I invited you\r\nand Northcote to write the report which has lit up the flame; but more\r\nand more do the incidental evils seem curable and the difficulties\r\nremovable.' As the Crimean war went on, the usual cry for administrative\r\nreform was raised, and Mr. Gladstone never made a more terse, pithy, and\r\nincontrovertible speech than his defence for an open civil service in\r\nthe summer of 1855.[330]\r\n\r\nFor this branch of reform, too, the inspiration had proceeded from\r\nOxford. Two of the foremost champions of the change had been\r\nTemple--afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury--and Jowett. The latter was\r\ndescribed by Mr. Gladstone to Graham as being 'as handy a workman as you\r\nshall readily find,' and in the beginning of 1855 he proposed to these\r\ntwo reformers that they should take the salaried office of examiners\r\nunder the civil service scheme. Much of his confident expectation of\r\ngood, he told them, was built upon their co-operation. In all his\r\nproceedings on this subject, Mr. Gladstone showed in strong light in how\r\nunique a degree he combined a profound democratic instinct with the\r\nspirit of good government; the instinct of popular equality along with\r\nthe scientific spirit of the enlightened bureaucrat.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[316] July 18, 1850.\r\n\r\n[317] Letter to Bishop Davidson, June 11, 1891.\r\n\r\n[318] _Life_, i. p. 420.\r\n\r\n[319] _Life of Stanley_, i. p. 432.\r\n\r\n[320] Letters to Graham, July 30, 1852, and Dr. Haddan, Aug. 14 and\r\nSept. 29, 1852.\r\n\r\n[321] _Letters_, March 26, 1853, p. 261.\r\n\r\n[322] Interesting particulars of this memorable commission are to be\r\nfound in the _Life of Archbishop Tait_, i. pp. 156-170.\r\n\r\n[323] Mozley, _Letters_, p. 220.

There is pomp and circumstance, there\r\n     is glory and excitement about war, which, notwithstanding the\r\n     miseries it entails, invests it with charms in the eyes of the\r\n     community, and tends to blind men to those evils to a fearful and\r\n     dangerous degree. The necessity of meeting from year to year the\r\n     expenditure which it entails is a salutary and wholesome check,\r\n     making them feel what they are about, and making them measure the\r\n     cost of the benefit upon which they may calculate.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe finance of 1854 offered nothing more original or ingenious than\r\nbluntly doubling the income tax (from seven pence to fourteen pence),\r\nand raising the duties on spirits, sugar, and malt. The draught was\r\nadministered in two doses, first in a provisional budget for half a year\r\n(March 6), next in a completed scheme two months later. During the\r\ninterval the chancellor of the exchequer was exposed to much criticism\r\nalike from city experts and plain men. The plans of 1853 had, in the\r\nmain, proved a remarkable success, but they were not without weak\r\npoints. Reductions in the duties of customs, excise, and stamps had all\r\nbeen followed by increase in their proceeds. But the succession duty\r\nbrought in no more than a fraction of the estimated sum--the only time,\r\nMr. Gladstone observes, in which he knew the excellent department\r\nconcerned to have fallen into such an error. The proposal for conversion\r\nproved, under circumstances already described, to have no attraction for\r\nthe fundholder. The operation on the South Sea stock was worse than a\r\nfailure, for it made the exchequer, in order to pay off eight millions\r\nat par, raise a larger sum at three and a half per cent., and at three\r\nper cent. in a stock standing at 87.[331] All this brought loudish\r\ncomplaints from the money market. The men at the clubs talked of the\r\ndiscredit into which Gladstone had fallen as a financier, and even\r\npersons not unfriendly to him spoke of him as rash, obstinate, and\r\ninjudicious. He was declared to have destroyed his prestige and\r\noverthrown his authority.[332]\r\n\r\n                       POWERFUL SELF-DEFENCE\r\n\r\nThis roused all the slumbering warrior in him, and when the time came\r\n(May 8), in a speech three and a half hours long, he threw his\r\ndetractors into a depth of confusion that might have satisfied the\r\nPsalmist himself. Peremptorily he brushed aside the apology of his\r\nassailants for not challenging him by a direct vote of want of\r\nconfidence, that such a vote would be awkward in a time of war. On the\r\ncontrary, he said, a case so momentous as the case of war is the very\r\nreason why you should show boldly whether you have confidence in our\r\nmanagement of your finances or not; if you disapprove, the sooner I know\r\nit the better. Then he dashed into a close and elaborate defence in\r\ndetail, under all the heads of attack,--his manner of dealing with the\r\nunfunded debt, his abortive scheme of conversion, his mode of charging\r\ndeficiency bills. This astonishing mass of dry and difficult matter was\r\nimpressed in full significance upon the House, not only by the orator's\r\nown buoyant and energetic interest in the performance, but by the sense\r\nwhich he awoke in his hearers, that to exercise their attention and\r\njudgment upon the case before them was a binding debt imperatively due\r\nto themselves and to the country, by men owning the high responsibility\r\nof their station. This was the way in which he at all times strove to\r\nstir the self-respect of the House of Commons. Not sparing his critics a\r\npoint or an argument, he drove his case clean home with a vigour that\r\nmade it seem as if the study of Augustine and Dante and the Fathers\r\nwere after all the best training for an intimate and triumphant mastery\r\nof the proper amount of gold to be kept at the bank, the right interest\r\non an exchequer bond and an exchequer bill, and all the arcana of the\r\npublic accounts.[333] Even where their case had something in it, he\r\nshowed that they had taken the wrong points. Nor did he leave out the\r\nspice of the sarcasm that the House loves. A peer had reproached him for\r\nthe amount of his deficiency bills. This peer had once himself for four\r\nyears been chancellor of the exchequer. 'My deficiency bills,' cried Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'reached three millions and a half. How much were the bills\r\nof the chancellor whom this figure shocks? In his first year they were\r\nfour millions and a half, in the second almost the same, in the third\r\nmore than five and a quarter, in the fourth nearly five millions and a\r\nhalf.' Disraeli and others pretended that they had foreseen the failure\r\nof the conversion. Mr. Gladstone proved that, as matter of recorded\r\nfact, they had done nothing of the sort. 'This is the way in which\r\nmythical history arises. An event happens without attracting much\r\nnotice; subsequently it excites interest; then people look back upon the\r\ntime now passed, and see things not as they are or were, but through the\r\nhaze of distance--they see them as they wish them to have been, and what\r\nthey wish them to have been, they believe that they were.'\r\n\r\nFor this budget no genius, only courage, was needed; but Mr. Gladstone\r\nadvanced in connection with it a doctrine that raised great questions,\r\nmoral, political, and economic, and again illustrated that\r\ncharacteristic of his mind which always made some broad general\r\nprinciple a necessity of action. All through 1854, and in a sense very\r\noften since, parliament was agitated by Mr. Gladstone's bold proposition\r\nthat the cost of war should be met by taxation at the time, and not by\r\nloans to be paid back by another generation. He did not advance his\r\nabstract doctrine without qualification. This, in truth, Mr. Gladstone\r\nhardly ever did, and it was one of the reasons why he acquired a bad\r\nname for sophistry and worse. Men fastened on the general principle, set\r\nout in all its breadth and with much emphasis; they overlooked the\r\nlurking qualification; and then were furiously provoked at having been\r\ntaken in. 'I do not know,' he wrote some years later to Northcote,\r\n'where you find that I laid down any general maxim that all war supplies\r\nwere to be raised by taxes.... I said in my speech of May 8, revised for\r\nHansard, it was the duty and policy of the country to make _in the first\r\ninstance_ a great effort from its own resources.' The discussions of the\r\ntime, however, seem to have turned on the unqualified construction.\r\nWhile professing his veneration and respect for the memory of Pitt, he\r\nopened in all its breadth the question raised by Pitt's policy of loan,\r\nloan, loan. The economic answer is open to more dispute than he then\r\nappeared to suppose, but it was the political and moral reasons for\r\nmeeting the demands of war by tax and not by loan that coloured his\r\neconomic view. The passage in which he set forth the grounds for his\r\nopinion has become a classic place in parliamentary discussion, but it\r\nis only too likely for a long time to come to bear reproducing, and I\r\nhave taken it as a motto for this chapter. His condemnation of loans,\r\nabsolutely if not relatively, was emphatic. 'The system of raising funds\r\nnecessary for wars by loan practises wholesale, systematic, and\r\ncontinual deception upon the people. The people do not really know what\r\nthey are doing. The consequences are adjourned into a far future.' I may\r\nas well here complete or correct this language by a further quotation\r\nfrom the letter to Northcote to which I have already referred. He is\r\nwriting in 1862 on Northcote's book on _Twenty Years of Finance_. 'I\r\ncannot refrain,' he says, 'from paying you a sincere compliment, first\r\non the skill with which you have composed an eminently readable work on\r\na dry subject; and secondly, on the tact founded in good feeling and the\r\nlove of truth with which you have handled your materials throughout.' He\r\nthen remarks on various points in the book, and among the rest on\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n                         LETTERS TO NORTHCOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n     Allow me also to say that I think in your comparison of the effect\r\n     of taxes and loans you have looked (p. 262) too much to the effect\r\n     on labour at the moment. Capital and labour are in permanent\r\n     competition for the division of the fruits of production. When in\r\n     years of war say twenty millions annually are provided by loan say\r\n     for three, five, or ten years, then two consequences follow.\r\n\r\n     1. An immense factitious stimulus is given to labour at the\r\n     time--and thus much more labour is brought into the market.\r\n\r\n     2. When that stimulus is withdrawn an augmented quantity of labour\r\n     is left to compete in the market with a greatly diminished quantity\r\n     of capital.\r\n\r\n     Here is the story of the _misery_ of great masses of the English\r\n     people after 1815, or at the least a material part of that story.\r\n\r\n     I hold by the doctrine that war loans are in many ways a great\r\n     evil: but I admit their necessity, and in fact the budget of 1855\r\n     was handed over by me to Sir George Lewis, and underwent in his\r\n     hands little alteration unless such as, with the growing demands of\r\n     the war, I should myself have had to make in it, _i.e._ some, not\r\n     very considerable, enlargement.\r\n\r\nWriting a second letter to Northcote a few days later (August 11, 1862),\r\nhe goes a little deeper into the subject:--\r\n\r\n     The general question of loans _v._ taxes for war purposes is one of\r\n     the utmost interest, but one that I have never seen worked out in\r\n     print. But assuming as _data_ the established principles of our\r\n     financial system, and by no means denying the necessity of loans, I\r\n     have not the least doubt that it is for the interest of labour, as\r\n     opposed to capital, that as large a share as possible of war\r\n     expenditure should be defrayed from taxes. When war breaks out the\r\n     wages of labour on the whole have a tendency to rise, and the\r\n     labour of the country is well able to bear some augmentation of\r\n     taxes. The sums added to the public expenditure are likely at the\r\n     outset, and for some time, to be larger than the sums withdrawn\r\n     from commerce. When war ends, on the contrary, a great mass of\r\n     persons are dismissed from public employment, and, flooding the\r\n     labour market, reduce the rate of wages. But again, when war comes,\r\n     it is quite certain that a large share of the war taxes will be\r\n     laid upon property: and that, in war, property will bear a larger\r\n     share of our total taxation than in peace. From this it seems to\r\n     follow at once that, up to the point at which endurance is\r\n     practicable, payment by war-taxes rather than by taxes in peace is\r\n     for the interest of the people at large. I am not one of those who\r\n     think that our system of taxation, taken as a whole, is an\r\n     over-liberal one towards them. These observations are mere\r\n     contributions to a discussion, and by no means pretend to dispose\r\n     of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\n                          DISPUTE WITH THE BANK\r\n\r\nIn the autumn he had a sharp tussle with the Bank of England, and\r\ndisplayed a toughness, stiffness, and sustained anger that greatly\r\nastonished Threadneedle Street. In the spring he had introduced a change\r\nin the mode of issuing deficiency bills, limiting the quarterly amount\r\nto such a sum as would cover the maximum of dividends payable, as known\r\nby long experience to be called for. The Bank held this to be illegal;\r\nclaimed the whole amount required, along with balances actually in hand,\r\nto cover the entire amount payable; and asked him to take the opinion of\r\nthe law officers. The lawyers backed the chancellor of the exchequer.\r\nThen the Bank took an opinion of their own; their counsel (Kelly and\r\nPalmer) advised that the attorney and solicitor were wrong; and\r\nrecommended the Bank to bring their grievance before the prime minister.\r\nMr. Gladstone was righteously incensed at this refusal to abide by an\r\nopinion invited by the Bank itself, and by which if it had been adverse\r\nhe would himself have been bound. 'And then,' said Bethell, urging Mr.\r\nGladstone to stand to his guns, 'its counsel call the Bank a trustee for\r\nthe public! Proh pudor! What stuff lawyers will talk. But 'tis their\r\nvocation.' Mr. Gladstone's letters were often prolix, but nobody could\r\nbe more terse and direct when occasion moved him, and the proceedings of\r\nthe lawyers with their high Bank views and the equivocal faith of the\r\ndirectors in bringing fresh lawyers into the case at all provoked more\r\nthan one stern and brief epistle. The governor, who was his private\r\nfriend, winced. 'I do not study diplomacy in letters of this kind,' Mr.\r\nGladstone replied, 'and there is no sort of doubt that I am very angry\r\nabout the matter of the opinion; but affected and sarcastic politeness\r\nis an instrument which in writing to you I should think it the worst\r\ntaste and the worst feeling to employ. I admire the old fashion\r\naccording to which in English pugilism (which, however, I do not admire)\r\nthe combatants shook hands before they fought; only I think much time\r\nought not to be spent upon such salutations when there is other work to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his wife seven years later, Mr. Gladstone says of this\r\ndispute, 'Mr. Arbuthnot told me to-day an observation of Sir George\r\nLewis's when at the exchequer here. Speaking of my controversy with the\r\nBank in 1854, he said, \"It is a pity Gladstone puts so much heat, so\r\nmuch irritability into business. Now I am as cool as a fish.\"' The worst\r\nof being as cool as a fish is that you never get great things done, you\r\neffect no improvements, and you carry no reforms, against the lethargy\r\nor selfishness of men and the tyranny of old custom.[334]\r\n\r\nNow also his attention was engaged by the controversies on currency that\r\nthrive so lustily in the atmosphere of the Bank Charter Act, and, after\r\nmuch discussion with authorities both in Lombard Street and at the\r\ntreasury, without committal he sketched out at least one shadow of a\r\nproject of his own. He knew, however, that any great measure must be\r\nundertaken by a finance minister with a clear position and strong hands,\r\nand he told Graham that even if he saw his way distinctly to a plan, he\r\ndid not feel individually strong enough for the attempt. Nor was there\r\ntime. To reconstitute the Savings Bank finance, to place the chancery\r\nand some other accounts on a right basis, and to readjust the banking\r\nrelations properly so-called between the Bank and the state, would be\r\neven more than a fair share of financial work for the session. Before\r\nthe year was over he passed a bill, for which he had laid before the\r\ncabinet elaborate argumentative supports, removing a number of\r\nobjections to the then existing system of dealing with the funds drawn\r\nfrom Savings Banks.[335]\r\n\r\nThe year closed with an incident that created a considerable stir, and\r\nmight by misadventure have become memorable. What has been truly called\r\na warm and prolonged dispute[336] arose out of Mr. Gladstone's removal\r\nof a certain official from his post in the department of woods and\r\nforests. As Lord Aberdeen told the Queen that he could not easily make\r\nthe case intelligible, it is not likely that I should succeed any\r\nbetter, and we may as well leave the thick dust undisturbed. Enough to\r\nsay that Lord John Russell thought the dismissal harsh; that Mr.\r\nGladstone stood his ground against either the reversal of what he had\r\ndone, or any proceedings in parliament that might look like contrition,\r\nbut was willing to submit the points to the decision of colleagues; that\r\nLord John would submit no point to colleagues 'affecting his personal\r\nhonour'--to such degrees of heat can the quicksilver mount even in a\r\ncabinet thermometer. If such quarrels of the great are painful, there is\r\nsome compensation in the firmness, patience, and benignity with which a\r\nman like Lord Aberdeen strove to appease them. Some of his colleagues\r\nactually thought that Lord John would make this paltry affair a plea for\r\nresigning, while others suspected that he might find a better excuse in\r\nthe revival of convocation. As it happened, a graver occasion offered\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[331] Northcote, _Financial Policy_, p. 242; Buxton, _Mr. Gladstone: A\r\nStudy_, pp. 154-5.\r\n\r\n[332] Greville, Part III. i. pp. 150, 151, 157.\r\n\r\n[333] Not many years before (1838), Talleyrand had surprised the French\r\ninstitute by a paper in which he passed a eulogy on strong theological\r\nstudies; their influence on vigour as well as on finesse of mind; on the\r\nskilful ecclesiastical diplomatists that those studies had formed.\r\n\r\n[334] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[335] 17 and 18 Vict., c. 50.\r\n\r\n[336] Walpole's _Russell_, ii. p. 243 _n_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n             CRISIS OF 1855 AND BREAK-UP OF THE PEELITES\r\n\r\n                              (_1855_)\r\n\r\n     Party has no doubt its evils; but all the evils of party put\r\n     together would be scarcely a grain in the balance, when compared\r\n     with the dissolution of honourable friendships, the pursuit of\r\n     selfish ends, the want of concert in council, the absence of a\r\n     settled policy in foreign affairs, the corruption of certain\r\n     statesmen, the caprices of an intriguing court, which the\r\n     extinction of party connection has brought and would bring again\r\n     upon this country.--EARL RUSSELL.[337]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe administrative miscarriages of the war in the Crimea during the\r\nwinter of 1854-5 destroyed the coalition government.[338] When\r\nparliament assembled on January 23, 1855, Mr. Roebuck on the first night\r\nof the session gave notice of a motion for a committee of inquiry. Lord\r\nJohn Russell attended to the formal business, and when the House was up\r\nwent home accompanied by Sir Charles Wood. Nothing of consequence passed\r\nbetween the two colleagues, and no word was said to Wood in the\r\ndirection of withdrawal. The same evening as the prime minister was\r\nsitting in his drawing-room, a red box was brought in to him by his son,\r\ncontaining Lord John Russell's resignation. He was as much amazed as\r\nLord Newcastle, smoking his evening pipe of tobacco in his coach, was\r\namazed by the news that the battle of Marston Moor had begun. Nothing\r\nhas come to light since to set aside the severe judgment pronounced upon\r\nthis proceeding by the Universal opinion of contemporaries, including\r\nLord John's own closest political allies. That a minister should run\r\naway from a hostile motion upon affairs for which responsibility was\r\ncollective, and this without a word of consultation with a single\r\ncolleague, is a transaction happily without a precedent in the history\r\nof modern English cabinets.[339] It opened an intricate and unexpected\r\nchapter of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial crisis of 1855 was unusually prolonged; it was\r\ninteresting as a drama of character and motive; it marked a decisive\r\nstage in the evolution of party, and it was one of the turning points in\r\nthe career of the subject of this biography. Fortunately for us, Mr.\r\nGladstone has told in his own way the whole story of what he calls this\r\n'sharp and difficult passage in public affairs,' and he might have added\r\nthat it was a sharp passage in his own life. His narrative, with the\r\nomission of some details now dead and indifferent, and of a certain\r\nnumber of repetitions, is the basis of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                        LORD JOHN'S RESIGNATION\r\n\r\nOn the day following Lord John's letter the cabinet met, and the prime\r\nminister told them that at first he thought it meant the break-up of the\r\ngovernment, but on further consideration he thought they should hold on,\r\nif it could be done with honour and utility. Newcastle suggested his own\r\nresignation, and the substitution of Lord Palmerston in his place.\r\nPalmerston agreed that the country, rightly or wrongly, wished to see\r\nhim at the war office, but he was ready to do whatever his colleagues\r\nthought best. The whigs thought resignation necessary. Mr. Gladstone\r\nthought otherwise, and scouted the suggestion that as Newcastle was\r\nwilling to resign, Lord John might come back. Lord John himself actually\r\nsent a sort of message to know whether he should attend the cabinet. In\r\nthe end Lord Aberdeen carried all their resignations to the Queen. These\r\nshe declined to accept, and she 'urged with the greatest eagerness that\r\nthe decision should be reconsidered.' It is hard at this distance of\r\ntime to understand how any cabinet under national circumstances of such\r\ngravity could have thought of the ignominy of taking to flight from a\r\nmotion of censure, whatever a single colleague like Lord John Russell\r\nmight deem honourable. On pressure from the Queen, the whigs in the\r\ngovernment, Lord John notwithstanding, agreed to stand fire. Mr.\r\nGladstone proceeds:--\r\n\r\n     Lord John's explanation, which was very untrue in its general\r\n     effect, though I believe kindly conceived in feeling as well as\r\n     tempered with some grains of policy and a contemplation of another\r\n     possible premiership, carried the House with him, as Herbert\r\n     observed while he was speaking. Palmerston's reply to him was\r\n     wretched. It produced in the House (that is, in so much of the\r\n     House as would otherwise have been favourable), a flatness and\r\n     deadness of spirit towards the government which was indescribable;\r\n     and Charles Wood with a marked expression of face said while it was\r\n     going on, 'And this is to be our leader!' I was myself so painfully\r\n     full of the scene, that when Palmerston himself sat down I was on\r\n     the very point of saying to him unconsciously, 'Can anything more\r\n     be said?' But no one would rise in the adverse sense, and therefore\r\n     there was no opening for a minister. Palmerston [now become leader\r\n     in the Commons] had written to ask me to follow Lord John on\r\n     account of his being _a party_. But it was justly thought in the\r\n     cabinet that there were good reasons against my taking this part\r\n     upon me, and so the arrangement was changed.\r\n\r\nRoebuck brought forward his motion. Mr. Gladstone resisted it on behalf\r\nof the government with immense argumentative force, and he put the point\r\nagainst Lord John which explains the word 'untrue' in the passage just\r\nquoted, namely, that though he desired in November the substitution of\r\nPalmerston for Newcastle as war minister, he had given it up in\r\nDecember, and yet this vital fact was omitted.[340] It was not for the\r\ngovernment, he said, either to attempt to make terms with the House by\r\nreconstruction of a cabinet, or to shrink from any judgment of the House\r\nupon their acts. If they had so shrunk, he exclaimed, this is the sort\r\nof epitaph that he would expect to have written over their remains:\r\n'Here lie the dishonoured ashes of a ministry that found England in\r\npeace and left in it war, that was content to enjoy the emoluments of\r\noffice and to wield the sceptre of power, so long as no man had the\r\ncourage to question their existence: they saw the storm gathering over\r\nthe country; they heard the agonising accounts that were almost daily\r\nreceived of the sick and wounded in the East. These things did not move\r\nthem, but so soon as a member of opposition raised his hand to point the\r\nthunderbolt, they became conscience-stricken into a sense of guilt, and\r\nhoping to escape punishment, they ran away from duty.' Such would be\r\ntheir epitaph. Of the proposed inquiry itself,--an inquiry into the\r\nconduct of generals and troops actually in the field, and fighting by\r\nthe side of, and in concert with, foreign allies, he observed--'Your\r\ninquiry will never take place as a real inquiry; or, if it did, it would\r\nlead to nothing but confusion and disturbance, increased disasters,\r\nshame at home and weakness abroad; it would convey no consolation to\r\nthose whom you seek to aid, but it would carry malignant joy to the\r\nhearts of the enemies of England; and, for my part, I shall ever\r\nrejoice, if this motion is carried to-night, that my own last words as a\r\nmember of the cabinet of the Earl of Aberdeen have been words of solemn\r\nand earnest protest against a proceeding which has no foundation either\r\nin the constitution or in the practice of preceding parliaments; which\r\nis useless and mischievous for the purpose which it appears to\r\ncontemplate; and which, in my judgment, is full of danger to the power,\r\ndignity, and usefulness of the Commons of England.' A journalistic\r\nobserver, while deploring the speaker's adherence to 'the dark\r\ndogmatisms of medieval religionists,' admits that he had never heard so\r\nfine a speech. The language, he says, was devoid of redundance. The\r\nattitude was calm. Mr. Gladstone seemed to feel that he rested upon the\r\nmagnitude of the argument, and had no need of the assistance of bodily\r\nvehemence of manner. His voice was clear, distinct, and flexible,\r\nwithout monotony. It was minute dissection without bitterness or\r\nill-humoured innuendo. He sat down amid immense applause from hearers\r\nadmiring but unconvinced. Mr. Gladstone himself records of this speech:\r\n'Hard and heavy work, especially as to the cases of three persons: Lord\r\nJohn Russell, Duke of Newcastle, and Lord Raglan.' Ministers were beaten\r\n(January 29) by 325 to 148, and they resigned.\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 30, 1855._--Cabinet 1-2. We exchanged friendly adieus. Dined\r\n     with the Herberts. This was a day of personal light-heartedness,\r\n     but the problem for the nation is no small one.\r\n\r\n                        END OF THE COALITION\r\n\r\nThe Queen sent for Lord Derby, and he made an attempt to form a\r\ngovernment. Without aid from the conservative wing of the fallen\r\nministry there was no hope, and his first step (Jan. 31) was to call on\r\nLord Palmerston, with an earnest request for his support, and with a\r\nhope that he would persuade Mr. Gladstone and Sidney Herbert to rejoin\r\ntheir old political connection; with the intimation moreover that Mr.\r\nDisraeli, with a self-abnegation that did him the highest credit, was\r\nwilling to waive in Lord Palmerston's favour his own claim to the\r\nleadership of the House of Commons. Palmerston was to be president of\r\nthe council, and Ellenborough minister of war. In this conversation Lord\r\nPalmerston made no objection on any political grounds, or on account of\r\nany contemplated measures; he found no fault with the position intended\r\nfor himself, or for others with whom he would be associated. Lord Derby\r\nsupposed that all would depend on the concurrence of Mr. Gladstone and\r\nHerbert. He left Cambridge House at half-past two in the afternoon, and\r\nat half-past nine in the evening he received a note from Lord Palmerston\r\ndeclining. Three hours later he heard from Mr. Gladstone, who declined\r\nalso. The proceedings of this eventful day, between two in the afternoon\r\nand midnight, whatever may have been the play of motive and calculation\r\nin the innermost minds of all or any of the actors, were practically to\r\ngo a long way, though by no means the whole way, as we shall see,\r\ntowards making Mr. Gladstone's severance from the conservative party\r\ndefinitive.\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 31._--Lord Palmerston came to see me between three and four,\r\n     with a proposal from Lord Derby that he and I, with S. Herbert\r\n     should take office under him; Palmerston to be president of the\r\n     council and lead the House of Commons. Not finding me when he\r\n     called before, he had gone to S. Herbert, who seemed to be\r\n     disinclined. I inquired (1) whether Derby mentioned Graham? (2)\r\n     Whether he had told Lord Palmerston if his persevering with the\r\n     commission he had received would depend on the answer to this\r\n     proposal. (3) How he was himself inclined. He answered the two\r\n     first questions in the negative, and said as to the third, though\r\n     not keenly, that he felt disinclined, but that if he refused it\r\n     would be attributed to his contemplating another result, which\r\n     other result he considered would be agreeable to the country. I\r\n     then argued strongly with him that though he might form a\r\n     government, and though if he formed it, he would certainly start it\r\n     amidst immense clapping of hands, yet he could not have any\r\n     reasonable prospect of stable parliamentary support; on the one\r\n     hand would stand Derby with his phalanx, on the other Lord J.\r\n     Russell, of necessity a centre and nucleus of discontent, and\r\n     between these two there would and could be no room for a\r\n     parliamentary majority such as would uphold his government. He\r\n     argued only rather faintly the other way, and seemed rather to come\r\n     to my way of thinking.\r\n\r\n     I said that even if the proposition were entertained, there would\r\n     be much to consider; that I thought it clear, whatever else was\r\n     doubtful, that we could not join without him, for in his absence\r\n     the wound would not heal kindly again, that I could not act without\r\n     Lord Aberdeen's approval, nor should I willingly separate myself\r\n     from Graham; that if we joined, we must join in force. But I was\r\n     disposed to wish that if all details could be arranged, we should\r\n     join in that manner rather than that Derby should give up the\r\n     commission, though I thought the best thing of all would be Derby\r\n     forming a ministry of his own men, provided only he could get a\r\n     good or fair foreign secretary instead of Clarendon, who in any\r\n     case would be an immense loss....\r\n\r\n     I went off to speak to Lord Aberdeen, and Palmerston went to speak\r\n     to Clarendon, with respect to whom he had told Derby that he could\r\n     hardly enter any government which had not Clarendon at the foreign\r\n     office. When we reassembled, I asked Lord Palmerston whether he had\r\n     made up his mind for himself independently of us, inasmuch as I\r\n     thought that if he had, that was enough to close the whole\r\n     question? He answered, Yes; that he should tell Derby he did not\r\n     think he could render him useful service in his administration. He\r\n     then left. It was perhaps 6.30. Herbert and I sat down to write,\r\n     but thought it well to send off nothing till after dinner, and we\r\n     went to Grillion's where we had a small but merry party. Herbert\r\n     even beyond himself amusing. At night we went to Lord Aberdeen's\r\n     and Graham's, and so my letter came through some slight emendations\r\n     to the form in which it went.[341] I had doubts in my mind whether\r\n     Derby had even intended to propose to Herbert and me _except_ in\r\n     conjunction with Palmerston, though I had no doubt that without\r\n     Palmerston it would not do; and I framed my letter so as not to\r\n     assume that I had an independent proposal, but to make my refusal a\r\n     part of his.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 2._--I yesterday also called on Lord Palmerston and read him\r\n     my letter to Lord Derby. He said: 'Nothing can be better.'\r\n\r\n                       LORD DERBY'S PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nLord Derby knew that, though he had the country gentlemen behind him,\r\nhis own political friends, with the notable and only half-welcome\r\nexception of Mr. Disraeli, were too far below mediocrity in either\r\ncapacity or experience to face so angry and dangerous a crisis.\r\nAccordingly he gave up the task. Many years after, Mr. Gladstone\r\nrecorded his opinion that here Lord Derby missed his one real chance of\r\nplaying a high historic part. 'To a Derby government,' he said, 'now\r\nthat the party had been _drubbed_ out of protection, I did not in\r\nprinciple object; for old ties were with me more operatively strong than\r\nnew opinions, and I think that Lord Derby's error in not forming an\r\nadministration was palpable and even gross. Such, it has appeared, was\r\nthe opinion of Disraeli.[342] Lord Derby had many fine qualities; but\r\nstrong parliamentary courage was not among them. When Lord Palmerston\r\n(probably with a sagacious discernment of the immediate future)\r\ndeclined, he made no separate offer to the Peelites. Had Lord Derby gone\r\non, he would have been supported by the country, then absorbed in the\r\nconsideration of the war. None of the three occasions when he took\r\noffice offered him so fine an opportunity as this; but he missed it.'\r\n\r\nOn the previous day, Mr. Gladstone records: 'Saw Mr. Disraeli in the\r\nHouse of Lords and put out my hand, which was very kindly accepted.' To\r\nnobody was the hour fraught with more bitter mortification than to Mr.\r\nDisraeli, who beheld a golden chance of bringing a consolidated party\r\ninto the possession of real power flung away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\n                      ERROR OF REFUSING LORD LANSDOWNE\r\n\r\nNext, at the Queen's request, soundings in the whig and Peelite waters\r\nwere undertaken by Lord Lansdowne, and he sent for Mr. Gladstone, with a\r\nresult that to the latter was ever after matter of regret.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 2._--In consequence of a communication from Lord Lansdowne, I\r\n     went to him in the forenoon and found him just returned from\r\n     Windsor. He trusted I should not mind speaking freely to him, and I\r\n     engaged to do it, only premising that in so crude and dark a state\r\n     of facts, it was impossible to go beyond first impressions. We then\r\n     conversed on various combinations, as (1) Lord J. Russell, premier,\r\n     (2) Lord Palmerston, (3) Lord Clarendon, (4) Lord Lansdowne\r\n     himself. Of the first I doubted whether, in the present state of\r\n     feeling, he could get a ministry on its legs. In answer to a\r\n     question from him, I added that I thought, viewing my relations to\r\n     Lord Aberdeen and to Newcastle, and _his_ to them also, the public\r\n     feeling would be offended, and it would not be for the public\r\n     interest, if I were to form part of his government (_i.e._\r\n     Russell's). Of the second I said that it appeared to me Lord\r\n     Palmerston could not obtain a party majority. Aloof from him would\r\n     stand on the one hand Derby and his party, on the other Lord J.\r\n     Russell, who I took it for granted would never serve under him.\r\n     Whatever the impression made by Russell's recent conduct, yet his\r\n     high personal character and station, forty years career, one-half\r\n     of it in the leadership of his party, and the close connection of\r\n     his name with all the great legislative changes of the period, must\r\n     ever render him a power in the state, and render it impossible for\r\n     a government depending on the liberal party to live independently\r\n     of him. I also hinted at injurious effects which the substitution\r\n     of Palmerston for Lord Aberdeen would produce on foreign Powers at\r\n     this critical moment, but dwelt chiefly on the impossibility of his\r\n     having a majority. In this Lord Lansdowne seemed to agree.\r\n\r\n     Lastly, I said that if Lord Lansdowne himself could venture to risk\r\n     his health and strength by taking the government, this would be the\r\n     best arrangement. My opinion was that at this crisis Derby, if he\r\n     could have formed an administration, would have had advantages with\r\n     regard to the absorbing questions of the war and of a peace to\r\n     follow it, such as no other combination could possess. Failing\r\n     this, I wished for a homogeneous whig government. The best form of\r\n     it would be under him. He said he might dare it provisionally, if\r\n     he could see his way to a permanent arrangement at the end of a\r\n     short term; but he could see nothing of the sort at present.\r\n\r\n     _An autobiographic note of 1897 gives a further detail of\r\n     moment_:--He asked whether I would continue to hold my office as\r\n     chancellor of the exchequer in the event of his persevering. He\r\n     said that if I gave an affirmative reply he would persevere with\r\n     the commission, and I think intimated that except on this condition\r\n     he would not. I said that the working of the coalition since its\r\n     formation in December 1852 had been to me entirely satisfactory,\r\n     but that I was not prepared to co-operate in its continuation under\r\n     any other head than Lord Aberdeen. I think that though perfectly\r\n     satisfied to be in a Peelite government which had whigs or radicals\r\n     in it, I was not ready to be in a whig government which had\r\n     Peelites in it. It took a long time, with my slow-moving and\r\n     tenacious character, for the Ethiopian to change his skin.\r\n\r\nIn the paper that I have already mentioned, as recording what, when all\r\nwas near an end, he took to be some of the errors of his life, Mr.\r\nGladstone names as one of those errors this refusal in 1855 to join Lord\r\nLansdowne. 'I can hardly suppose,' he says, more than forty years after\r\nthat time, 'that the eventual failure of the Queen's overture to Lord\r\nLansdowne was due to my refusal; but that refusal undoubtedly\r\nconstituted one of his difficulties and helped to bring about the\r\nresult. I have always looked back upon it with pain as a serious and\r\neven gross error of judgment. It was, I think, injurious to the public,\r\nif it contributed to the substitution as prime minister of Lord\r\nPalmerston for Lord Lansdowne,--a personage of greater dignity, and I\r\nthink a higher level of political principle. There was no defect in Lord\r\nLansdowne sufficient to warrant my refusal. He would not have been a\r\nstrong or very active prime minister; but the question of the day was\r\nthe conduct of the war, and I had no right to take exception to him as a\r\nhead in connection with this subject. His attitude in domestic policy\r\nwas the same as Palmerston's, but I think he had a more unprejudiced and\r\nliberal mind, though less of motive force in certain directions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                         FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Gladstone called on Lord Aberdeen, who for the first\r\ntime let drop a sort of opinion as to their duties in the crisis on one\r\npoint; hithertofore he had restrained himself. He said, 'Certainly the\r\nmost natural thing under the circumstances, if it could have been\r\nbrought about in a satisfactory form, would have been that you should\r\nhave joined Derby.' On returning home, Mr. Gladstone received an\r\nimportant visitor and a fruitless visit.\r\n\r\n     At half-past two to-day Lord John Russell was announced; and sat\r\n     till three--his hat shaking in his hand. A communication had\r\n     reached him late last night from the Queen, charging him with the\r\n     formation of a government, and he had thought it his duty to make\r\n     the endeavour. I repeated to him what I had urged on Lord\r\n     Lansdowne, that a coalition with advantages has also weaknesses of\r\n     its own, that the late coalition was I thought fully justified by\r\n     the circumstances under which it took place, but at this juncture\r\n     it had broken down. This being so, I thought what is called a\r\n     homogeneous government would be best for the public, and most\r\n     likely to command approval; that Derby if he could get a good\r\n     foreign minister would have had immense advantages with respect to\r\n     the great questions of war and peace. Lord John agreed as to Derby;\r\n     thought that every one must have supported him, and that he ought\r\n     to have persevered.\r\n\r\n     I held to my point, adding that I did not think Lord Aberdeen and\r\n     Lord Palmerston represented opposite principles, but rather\r\n     different forms of the same principles connected with different\r\n     habits and temperaments. He said that Lord Palmerston had agreed to\r\n     lead the House of Commons for him, he going as first minister to\r\n     the Lords; but he did not mention any other alteration. Upon the\r\n     whole his tone was low and doubtful. He asked whether my answer was\r\n     to be considered as given, or whether I would take time. But I said\r\n     as there was no probability that my ideas would be modified by\r\n     reflection, it would not be fair to him to ask any delay.\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of Lord Palmerston, none of his colleagues\r\nwould have anything to do with Lord John, some even declining to go to\r\nsee him. Wood came to Mr. Gladstone, evidently in the sense of the\r\nPalmerston premiership. He declared that Aberdeen was impossible, to\r\nwhich, says Mr. Gladstone, 'I greatly demurred.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nThus the two regular party leaders had failed; Lord Aberdeen, the\r\ncoalition leader, was almost universally known to be out of the\r\nquestion; the public was loudly clamouring for Lord Palmerston. A\r\nPalmerston ministry was now seen to be inevitable. Were the Peelites,\r\nthen, having refused Lord Derby, having refused Lord John, having told\r\nLord Lansdowne that he had better form a system of homogeneous whigs,\r\nnow finally to refuse Lord Palmerston, on no better ground than that\r\nthey could not have Lord Aberdeen, whom nobody save themselves would\r\nconsent on any terms to have? To propound such a question was to answer\r\nit. Lord Aberdeen himself, with admirable freedom from egotism, pressed\r\nthe point that in addition to the argument of public necessity, they\r\nowed much to their late whig colleagues, 'who behaved so nobly and so\r\ngenerously towards us after Lord John's resignation.'\r\n\r\n'I have heard club talk and society talk,' wrote an adherent to Mr.\r\nGladstone late one night (February 4), 'and I am sure that in the main\r\nany government containing good names in the cabinet, provided Lord John\r\nis not in it, will obtain general support. Lord Clarendon is\r\nuniversally, or nearly so, looked on as essential. Next to him, I think\r\nyou are considered of vital importance in your present office. After\r\nall, rightly or wrongly, Lord Palmerston is master of the situation in\r\nthe country; he is looked upon as the man. If the country sees you and\r\nSidney Herbert holding aloof from him, it will be said the Peelites are\r\nselfish intriguers.' The same evening, another correspondent said to Mr.\r\nGladstone: 'Two or three people have come in since eleven o'clock with\r\nthe news of Brooks's and the Reform. Exultation prevails there, and the\r\ncertainty of Palmerston's success to-morrow. There is a sort of rumour\r\nprevalent that Lord Palmerston may seek Lord J. Russell's aid.... This\r\nwould, of course, negative all idea of your joining in the concern.\r\nOtherwise a refusal would be set down as sheer impracticability, or else\r\nthe selfish ambition of a clique which could not stand alone, and should\r\nno longer attempt to do so. If the refusal to join Palmerston is to be a\r\ngoing over to the other side, and a definite junction within a brief\r\nspace, that is clear and intelligible. But a refusal to join Lord\r\nPalmerston and yet holding out to him a promise of support, is a\r\nhalf-measure which no one will understand, and which, I own, I cannot\r\nsee the grounds to defend.'\r\n\r\n                     PALMERSTON FORMS A MINISTRY\r\n\r\nWe shall now find how after long and strenuous dubitation, the Peelite\r\nleaders refused to join on the fifth of February, and then on the sixth\r\nthey joined. Unpromising from the very first cabinet, the junction was\r\ndestined to a swift and sudden end. Here is the story told by one of the\r\ntwo leading actors.\r\n\r\n     _Sunday, Feb. 4._--Herbert came to me soon after I left him, and\r\n     told me Palmerston had at last got the commission. He considered\r\n     that this disposed of Lord Lansdowne; and seemed himself to be\r\n     disposed to join. He said _we_ must take care what we were about,\r\n     and that we should be looked upon by the country as too nice if we\r\n     declined to join Palmerston; who he believed (and in this I\r\n     inclined to agree), would probably form a government. He argued\r\n     that Lord Aberdeen was out of the question; that the vote of Monday\r\n     night was against him; that the country would not stand him.\r\n\r\n     No new coalition ought to be formed, I said, without a prospect of\r\n     stability; and joining Lord Palmerston's cabinet would be a new\r\n     coalition. He said he rather applied that phrase to a junction with\r\n     Derby. I quite agreed we could not join Derby except under\r\n     conditions which might not be realised; but if we _did_ it, it\r\n     would be a reunion, not a coalition. In coalition the separate\r\n     existence is retained. I referred to the great instances of change\r\n     of party in our time; Palmerston himself, and Stanley with Graham.\r\n     But these took place when parties were divided by great questions\r\n     of principle; there were none such now, and no one could say that\r\n     the two sides of the House were divided by anything more than this,\r\n     that one was rather more stationary, the other more movable. He\r\n     said, 'True, the differences are on the back benches.'\r\n\r\n     I said I had now for two years been holding my mind in suspense\r\n     upon the question I used to debate with Newcastle, who used to\r\n     argue that we should grow into the natural leaders of the liberal\r\n     party. I said, it is now plain this will not be; we get on very\r\n     well with the independent liberals, but the whigs stand as an\r\n     opaque body between us and them, and moreover, there they will\r\n     stand and ought to stand.\r\n\r\n     Lord Palmerston came a little after two, and remained perhaps an\r\n     hour. Lord Lansdowne had promised to join him if he formed an\r\n     administration on a basis sufficiently broad. He wished me to\r\n     retain my office; and dwelt on the satisfactory nature of my\r\n     relations with the liberal party. He argued that Lord Aberdeen was\r\n     excluded by the vote on Monday night; and that there was now no\r\n     other government in view. My argument was adverse, though without\r\n     going to a positive conclusion. I referred to my conversation of\r\n     Wednesday, Jan. 31, in favour of a homogeneous government at this\r\n     juncture.\r\n\r\n     At half-past eleven I went to Lord Aberdeen's and stayed about an\r\n     hour. His being in the Palmerston cabinet which had been proposed,\r\n     was, he said, out of the question; but his _velleities_ seemed to\r\n     lean rather to _our_ joining, which surprised me. He was afraid of\r\n     the position we should occupy in the public eye if we declined....\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 5._--The most irksome and painful of the days; beginning with\r\n     many hours of anxious consultation to the best of our power, and\r\n     ending amidst a storm of disapproval almost unanimous, not only\r\n     from the generality, but from our own immediate political friends.\r\n\r\n     At 10.30 I went to Sir James Graham, who is still in bed, and told\r\n     him the point to which by hard struggles I had come. The case with\r\n     me was briefly this. I was ready to make the sacrifice of personal\r\n     feeling; ready to see him (Lord Aberdeen) expelled from the\r\n     premiership by a censure equally applicable to myself, and yet to\r\n     remain in my office; ready to overlook not merely the inferior\r\n     fitness, but the real and manifest unfitness, of Palmerston for\r\n     that office; ready to enter upon a new venture with him, although\r\n     in my opinion without any reasonable prospect of parliamentary\r\n     support, such as is absolutely necessary for the credit and\r\n     stability of a government--upon the one sole and all-embracing\r\n     ground that the prosecution of the war with vigour, and the\r\n     prosecution of it to and for peace, was now the question of the day\r\n     to which every other must give way. But then it was absolutely\r\n     necessary that if we joined a cabinet after our overlooking all\r\n     this and more, it should be a cabinet in which confidence should be\r\n     placed with reference to war and peace. Was the Aberdeen cabinet\r\n     without Lord Aberdeen one in which I could place confidence? I\r\n     answer, No. He was vital to it; his love of peace was necessary to\r\n     its right and steady pursuit of that great end; if, then, _he_\r\n     could belong to a Palmerston cabinet, I might; but without him I\r\n     could not.\r\n\r\n     In all this, Sir J. Graham concurred. Herbert came full of doubts\r\n     and fears, but on the whole adopted the same conclusion. Lord\r\n     Aberdeen sent to say he would not come, but I wrote to beg him, and\r\n     he appeared. On hearing how we stood, he said his remaining in the\r\n     cabinet was quite out of the question; and that he had told\r\n     Palmerston so yesterday when he glanced at it. But he thought we\r\n     should incur great blame if we did not; which, indeed, was plainly\r\n     beyond all dispute.\r\n\r\n                            THE PEELITES JOIN\r\n\r\n     At length, when I had written and read aloud the rough draft of an\r\n     answer, Lord Aberdeen said he must strongly advise our joining. I\r\n     said to him, 'Lord Aberdeen, when we have joined the Palmerston\r\n     cabinet, you standing aloof from it, will you rise in your place in\r\n     the House of Lords and say that you give that cabinet your\r\n     confidence with regard to the question of war and peace?' He\r\n     replied, 'I will express my hope that it will do right, but not my\r\n     confidence, which is a different thing.' 'Certainly,' I answered,\r\n     'and that which you have now said is my justification. The\r\n     unswerving honesty of your mind has saved us. Ninety-nine men out\r\n     of a hundred in your position at the moment would have said, \"Oh\r\n     yes, I shall express my confidence.\" But you would not deviate an\r\n     inch to the right or to the left.'\r\n\r\n     Herbert and I went to my house and despatched our answers. Now\r\n     began the storm. Granville met us driving to Newcastle. Sorry\r\n     beyond expression; he almost looked displeased, which for him is\r\n     much. _Newcastle_: I incline to think you are wrong. _Canning_: My\r\n     impression is you are wrong. Various letters streaming in, all\r\n     portending condemnation and disaster. Herbert became more and more\r\n     uneasy.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 6._--The last day I hope of these tangled records; in which\r\n     we have seen, to say nothing of the lesser sacrifice, one more\r\n     noble victim struck down, and we are set to feast over the remains.\r\n     The thing is bad and the mode worse.\r\n\r\n     Arthur Gordon came early in the day with a most urgent letter from\r\n     Lord Aberdeen addressed virtually to us, and urging us to join. He\r\n     had seen both Palmerston and Clarendon, and derived much\r\n     satisfaction from what they said. We met at the admiralty at\r\n     twelve, where Graham lay much knocked up with the fatigue and\r\n     anxiety of yesterday. I read to him and Lord Aberdeen Palmerston's\r\n     letter of to-day to me. Herbert came in and made arguments in his\r\n     sense. I told him I was at the point of yesterday, and was\r\n     immovable by considerations of the class he urged. _The only\r\n     security worth having lies in men_; the man is Lord Aberdeen; moral\r\n     union and association with him must continue, and must be publicly\r\n     known to continue. I therefore repeated my question to Lord\r\n     Aberdeen, whether he would in his place as a peer declare, if we\r\n     joined the cabinet, that it had his confidence with reference to\r\n     war and peace? He said, much moved, that he felt the weight of the\r\n     responsibility, but that after the explanation and assurances he\r\n     had received, he would. He was even more moved when Graham said\r\n     that though the leaning of his judgment was adverse, he would place\r\n     himself absolutely in the hands of Lord Aberdeen. To Herbert, of\r\n     course, it was a simple release from a difficulty. Palmerston had\r\n     told Cardwell, 'Gladstone feels a difficulty first infused into him\r\n     by Graham; Argyll and Herbert have made up their minds to do what\r\n     Gladstone does.' Newcastle joined us, and was in Herbert's sense. I\r\n     repeated again that Lord Aberdeen's declaration of confidence\r\n     enabled me to see my way to joining....\r\n\r\n     I went to Lord Aberdeen in his official room after his return from\r\n     Palmerston. It was only when I left that room to-day that I began\r\n     to realise the pang of parting. There he stood, struck down from\r\n     his eminence by a vote that did not dare to avow its own purpose,\r\n     and for his wisdom and virtue; there he stood endeavouring to cure\r\n     the ill consequences to the public of the wrong inflicted upon\r\n     himself, and as to the point immediately within reach successful in\r\n     the endeavour. I ventured, however, to tell him that I hoped our\r\n     conduct and reliance on him would tend to his eminence and honour,\r\n     and said, 'You are not to be of the cabinet, but you are to be its\r\n     tutelary deity.'\r\n\r\n     I had a message from Palmerston that he would answer me, but at\r\n     night I went up to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                         THE COMMITTEE REVIVED\r\n\r\nThe rush of events was now somewhat slackened. Lord John called on\r\nGraham, and complained of the Peelites for having selfishly sought too\r\nmany offices, alluding to what Canning had done, and imputing the same\r\nto Cardwell. He also thought they had made a great mistake in joining\r\nPalmerston. He seemed sore about Mr. Gladstone, and told Graham that\r\nChristopher, a stout tory, had said that if Gladstone joined Derby, a\r\nhundred of the party would withdraw their allegiance. At the party\r\nmeeting on Feb. 21, Lord Derby was received with loud cries of 'No\r\nPuseyites; No papists,' and was much reprehended for asking Gladstone\r\nand Graham to join.\r\n\r\n'I ought to have mentioned before,' Mr. Gladstone writes here, 'that,\r\nduring our conferences at the admiralty, Lord Aberdeen expressed great\r\ncompunction for having allowed the country to be dragged without\r\nadequate cause into the war. So long as he lived, he said with his own\r\ndepth and force, it would be a weight upon his conscience. He had held\r\nsimilar language to me lately at Argyll House; but when I asked him at\r\nwhat point _after_ the fleet went to Besika Bay it would have been\r\npossible to stop short, he alluded to the _sommation_, which we were\r\nencouraged however, as he added, by Austria to send; and thought _this_\r\nwas the false step. Yet he did not seem quite firm in the opinion.'\r\n\r\nThen came the first cabinet (Feb. 10). It did not relieve the gloom of\r\nMr. Gladstone's impressions. He found it more 'acephalous' than ever;\r\n'less order; less unity of purpose.' The question of the Roebuck\r\ncommittee was raised, on which he said he thought the House would give\r\nit up, if government would promise an investigation under the authority\r\nof the crown. The fatal subject came up again three days later.\r\nPalmerston said it was plain from the feeling in the House the night\r\nbefore, that they were set upon it; if they could secure a fair\r\ncommittee, he was disposed to let the inquiry go forward. On this rock\r\nthe ship struck. One minister said they could not resign in consequence\r\nof the appointment of the committee, because it stood affirmed by a\r\nlarge majority when they took office in the reconstructed cabinet. Mr.\r\nGladstone says he 'argued with vehemence upon the breach of duty which\r\nit would involve on our part towards those holding responsible commands\r\nin the Crimea, if we without ourselves condemning them were to allow\r\nthem to be brought before another tribunal like a select committee.'\r\n\r\nDining the same evening at the palace, Mr. Gladstone had a conversation\r\non the subject both with the Queen and Prince Albert. 'The latter\r\ncompared this appointment of a committee to the proceedings of the\r\nConvention of France; but still seemed to wish that the government\r\nshould submit rather than retire. The Queen spoke openly in that sense,\r\nand trusted that she should not be given over into the hands of those\r\n\"who are the least fit to govern.\" Without any positive and final\r\ndeclaration, I intimated to each that I did not think I could bring my\r\nmind to acquiesce in the proposition for an inquiry by a select\r\ncommittee into the state of the army in the Crimea.'\r\n\r\nTime did not remove difficulties. Mr. Gladstone and Graham fought with\r\nextreme tenacity, and the first of them with an ingenuity for which the\r\nsituation gave boundless scope. To the argument that they accepted\r\noffice on reconstruction with the decision of the House for a committee\r\nstaring them in the face, he replied: 'Before we were _out_, we were\r\n_in_. Why did we go out? Because of that very decision by the House of\r\nCommons. Our language was: The appointment of such a committee is\r\nincompatible with the functions of the executive, therefore it is a\r\ncensure on the executive; therefore we resign! But it is not a whit\r\n_more_ compatible with the functions of the executive now than it was\r\nthen; therefore it is not one whit less a censure; and the question\r\narises, (1) whether any government ought to allow its (now) principal\r\nduty to be delegated to a committee or other body, especially to one not\r\nunder the control of the crown? (2) whether _that_ government ought to\r\nallow it, the members of which (except one) have already resigned rather\r\nthan allow it? In what way can the first resignation be justified on\r\ngrounds which do not require a second?' He dwelt mainly on these two\r\npoints--That the proposed transfer of the functions of the executive to\r\na select committee of the House of Commons, with respect to an army in\r\nthe face of the enemy and operating by the side of our French allies,\r\nand the recognition of this transfer by the executive government, was an\r\nevil greater than any that could arise from a total or partial\r\nresignation. Second, that it was clear that they did not, as things\r\nstood, possess the confidence of a majority of the House. 'I said that\r\nthe committee was itself a censure on the government. They had a right\r\nto believe that parliament would not inflict this committee on a\r\ngovernment which had its confidence. I also,' he says, 'recited my\r\nhaving ascertained from Palmerston (upon this recital we were agreed) on\r\nthe 6th, before our decision was declared, his intention to oppose the\r\ncommittee....'\r\n\r\n                         PEELITES RESIGN\r\n\r\nGraham did not feel disposed to govern without the confidence of the\r\nHouse of Commons, or to be responsible for the granting of a committee\r\nwhich the cabinet had unanimously felt to be unprecedented,\r\nunconstitutional, and dangerous. Lord Palmerston met all this by a\r\nstrong practical clincher. He said that the House of Commons was\r\nbecoming unruly from the doubts that had gone abroad as to the\r\nintentions of the government with respect to the committee; that the\r\nHouse was determined to have it; that if they opposed it they should be\r\nbeaten by an overwhelming majority; to dissolve upon it would be\r\nruinous; to resign a fortnight after taking office would make them the\r\nlaughingstock of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, Herbert, and Graham then resigned. Of the Peelite group\r\nthe Duke of Argyll and Canning remained.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 22._--After considering various _sites_, we determined to ask\r\n     the Manchester school to yield us, at any rate for to-morrow, the\r\n     old place devoted to ex-ministers.[343] Sir J. Graham expressed his\r\n     wish to begin the affair, on the proposal of the first name [of the\r\n     committee].\r\n\r\n     Cardwell came at 4 to inform me that he had declined to be my\r\n     successor; and showed me his letter, which gave as his reason\r\n     disinclination to step into the cabinet over the bodies of his\r\n     friends. It seems that Palmerston and Lord Lansdowne, who assists\r\n     him, sent Canning to Lord Aberdeen to invoke his aid with Cardwell\r\n     and prevail on him to retract. But Lord Aberdeen, though he told\r\n     Canning that he disapproved (at variance here with what Graham and\r\n     I considered to be his tone on Monday, but agreeing with a note he\r\n     wrote in obscure terms the next morning), said he could not make\r\n     such a request to Cardwell, or again play the peculiar part he had\r\n     acted a fortnight ago. The cabinet on receiving Cardwell's refusal\r\n     were at a deadlock. Application was to be made, or had been made,\r\n     to Sir Francis Baring, but it seems that he is reluctant; he is,\r\n     however, the best card they have to play.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 28._--On Sunday, Sir George Lewis called on me, and said my\r\n     office had been offered him. This was after being refused by\r\n     Cardwell and Baring. He asked my advice as to accepting it. This I\r\n     told him I could not give. He asked if I would assist him with\r\n     information in case of his accepting. I answered that he might\r\n     command me precisely as if instead of resigning I had only removed\r\n     to another department. I then went over some of the matters needful\r\n     to be made known. On Tuesday he came again, acquainted me with his\r\n     acceptance, and told me he had been mainly influenced by my\r\n     promise.[344]\r\n\r\n     This day at a quarter to three I attended at the palace to resign\r\n     the seals, and had an audience of about twenty minutes. The Queen,\r\n     in taking them over, was pleased to say that she received them with\r\n     great pain. I answered that the decision which had required me to\r\n     surrender them had been the most painful effort of my public life.\r\n     The Queen said she was afraid on Saturday night [Feb. 17, when he\r\n     had dined at the palace] from the language I then used that this\r\n     was about to happen. I answered that we had then already had a\r\n     discussion in the cabinet which pointed to this result, and that I\r\n     spoke as I did, because I thought that to have no reserve whatever\r\n     with H. M. was the first duty of all those who had the honour and\r\n     happiness of being her servants. I trusted H. M. would believe that\r\n     we had all been governed by no other desire than to do what was\r\n     best for the interests of the crown and the country. H. M. expressed\r\n     her confidence of this, and at no time throughout the conversation\r\n     did she in any manner indicate an opinion that our decision had\r\n     been wrong. She spoke of the difficulty of making arrangements for\r\n     carrying on the government in the present state of things, and I\r\n     frankly gave my opinion to H. M. that she would have little peace or\r\n     comfort in these matters, until parliament should have returned to\r\n     its old organisation in two political parties; that at present we\r\n     were in a false position, and that both sides of the House were\r\n     demoralised--the ministerial side overcharged with an excess of\r\n     official men, and the way stopped up against expectants, which led\r\n     to subdivision, jealousy, and intrigue; the opposition so weak in\r\n     persons having experience of affairs as to be scarcely within the\r\n     chances of office, and consequently made reckless by acting without\r\n     keeping it in view; yet at the same time, the party continued and\r\n     must continue to exist, for it embodied one of the great\r\n     fundamental elements of English society. The experiment of\r\n     coalition had been tried with remarkable advantage under a man of\r\n     the remarkable wisdom and powers of conciliation possessed by Lord\r\n     Aberdeen, one in entire possession too of H. M.'s confidence. They\r\n     intimated that there were peculiar disadvantages, too, evidently\r\n     meaning Lord J. Russell. I named him in my answer, and said I\r\n     thought that even if he had been steady, yet the divisions of the\r\n     ministerial party would a little later have brought about our\r\n     overthrow.[345] H. M. seeming to agree in my main position, as did\r\n     the Prince, asked me: But when will parliament return to that\r\n     state? I replied I grieved to say that I perceived neither the time\r\n     when, nor the manner how, that result is to come about; but until\r\n     it is reached, I fear that Y. M. will pass through a period of\r\n     instability and weakness as respects the executive. She observed\r\n     that the prospect is not agreeable. I said, True, madam, but it is\r\n     a great consolation that all these troubles are upon the surface,\r\n     and that the throne has for a long time been gaining and not losing\r\n     stability from year to year. I could see but one danger to the\r\n     throne, and that was from encroachments by the House of Commons. No\r\n     other body in the country was strong enough to encroach. This was\r\n     the consideration which had led my resigning colleagues with myself\r\n     to abandon office that we might make our stand against what we\r\n     thought a formidable invasion.... I thought the effect of the\r\n     resistance was traceable in the good conduct of the House of\r\n     Commons last night, when another attempt at encroachment was\r\n     proposed and firmly repelled.... I expressed my comfort at finding\r\n     that our motives were so graciously appreciated by H. M. and\r\n     withdrew.\r\n\r\n                              PUBLIC OUTCRY\r\n\r\nLoud was the public outcry. All the censure that had been foretold in\r\ncase they should refuse to join, fell with double force upon them for\r\nfirst joining and then seceding. Lord Clarendon pronounced their\r\nconduct to be actually worse and more unpatriotic than Lord John's. The\r\ndelight at Brooks's Club was uproarious, for to the whigs the Peelites\r\nhad always been odious, and they had been extremely sorry when\r\nPalmerston asked them to join his government.[346] For a time Mr.\r\nGladstone was only a degree less unpopular in the country than Cobden\r\nand Bright themselves. The newspapers declared that Gladstone's epitaph\r\nover the Aberdeen administration might be applied with peculiar force to\r\nhis own fate. The short truth seems to be that Graham, Gladstone, and\r\nPalmerston were none of them emphatic or explicit enough beforehand on\r\nthe refusal of the committee when the government was formed, though the\r\nintention to refuse was no doubt both stated and understood. Graham\r\nadmitted afterwards that this omission was a mistake. The world would be\r\nastonished if it knew how often in the pressure of great affairs men's\r\nsight proves short. After the language used by Mr. Gladstone about the\r\ninquiry, we cannot wonder that he should have been slow to acquiesce.\r\nThe result in time entirely justified his description of the Sebastopol\r\ncommittee.[347] But right as was his judgment on the merits, yet the\r\ncase was hardly urgent enough to make withdrawal politic or wise. Idle\r\ngossip long prevailed, that Graham could not forgive Palmerston for not\r\nhaving (as he thought) helped to defend him in the matter of opening\r\nMazzini's letters; that from the first he was bent on overthrowing the\r\nnew minister; that he worked on Gladstone; and that the alleged reason\r\nwhy they left was not the real one. All the evidence is the other way;\r\nthat Graham could not resist the obvious want of the confidence of\r\nparliament, and that Gladstone could not bear a futile and perilous\r\ninquiry. That they both regretted that they had yielded to\r\nover-persuasion in joining, against their own feelings and judgment, is\r\ncertain. Graham even wrote to Mr. Gladstone in the following summer that\r\nhis assent to joining Palmerston was perhaps the greatest mistake of his\r\npublic life. In Mr. Gladstone's case, the transaction gave a rude and\r\nprotracted shock to his public influence.\r\n\r\n                       LORD PALMERSTON'S REIGN\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston meanwhile sat tight in his saddle. When the crisis first\r\nbegan, Roebuck in energetic language had urged him to sweep the Peelites\r\nfrom his path, and at any rate he now very steadily went on without\r\nthem. Everybody took for granted that his administration would be\r\ntemporary. Mr. Gladstone himself gave it a twelvemonth at most. As it\r\nhappened, Lord Palmerston was in fact, with one brief interruption,\r\ninstalled for a decade. He was seventy-one; he had been nearly forty\r\nyears in office; he had worked at the admiralty, war department, foreign\r\noffice, home office; he had served under ten prime ministers--Portland,\r\nPerceval, Liverpool, Canning, Goderich, Wellington, Grey, Melbourne,\r\nRussell, Aberdeen. He was not more than loosely attached to the whigs,\r\nand he had none of the strength of that aristocratic tradition and its\r\norgan, the Bedford sect. The landed interest was not with him. The\r\nManchester men detested him. The church in all its denominations was on\r\nterms of cool and reciprocated indifference with one who was above all\r\nelse the man of this world. The press he knew how to manage. In every\r\nart of parliamentary sleight of hand he was an expert, and he suited the\r\ntemper of the times, while old maxims of government and policy were\r\ntardily expiring, and the forces of a new era were in their season\r\ngathering to a head.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[337] On Bute's plan of superseding party by prerogative, in the\r\nintroduction to vol. iii. of the Bedford _Correspondence_.\r\n\r\n[338] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[339] See Chap. x. of Lord Stanmore's _Earl of Aberdeen_.\r\n\r\n[340] 'This _suppressio veri_ is shocking, and one of the very worst\r\nthings he ever did.'--_Greville_, iii. i. p. 232.\r\n\r\n[341] At Lord Aberdeen's the question seems to have been discussed on\r\nthe assumption that the offer to Mr. Gladstone and Herbert was meant to\r\nbe independent of Palmerston's acceptance or refusal, and the impression\r\nthere was that Mr. Gladstone had been not wholly disinclined to consider\r\nthe offer.\r\n\r\n[342] Malmesbury's _Memoirs of an Ex-Minister_, i. pp. 8, 37.\r\n\r\n[343] On Feb. 23, he writes to Mr. Hayter, the government whip: 'We have\r\narranged to sit in the orthodox ex-ministers' place to-night, _i.e._\r\nsecond bench immediately below the gangway. This avoids constructions\r\nand comparisons which we could hardly otherwise have escaped; and Bright\r\nand his friends agreed to give it us. Might I trust to your kindness to\r\nhave some cards put in the place for us before prayers?'\r\n\r\n[344] While Lewis went to the exchequer, Sir Charles Wood succeeded\r\nGraham at the admiralty, Lord John, then on his way to Vienna, agreed to\r\ncome hack to the cabinet and took the colonial office, which Sir George\r\nGrey had left for the home office, where he succeeded Palmerston.\r\n\r\n[345] This seems to contradict the proposition in the article on\r\nGreville in the _Eng. Hist. Rev._ of 1887.\r\n\r\n[346] _Greville_, III. i. p. 246.\r\n\r\n[347] Mr. Gladstone projected and partly executed some public letters on\r\nall this, to be addressed, like the Neapolitan letters, to Lord\r\nAberdeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         POLITICAL ISOLATION\r\n\r\n                            (_1855-1856_)\r\n\r\n     [Greek: ekista gar polemos epi retois chorei]--THUC. i. 122.\r\n\r\n     War is the last thing in all the world to go according to\r\n     programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatesmen are invincibly slow to learn the lesson put by Thucydides long\r\ncenturies ago into the mouth of the Athenian envoys at Sparta, and often\r\nrepeated in the same immortal pages, that war defies all calculations,\r\nand if it be protracted comes to be little more than mere matter of\r\nchance, over which the combatants have no control. A thousand times\r\nsince has history proved this to be true. Policy is mastered by events;\r\nunforeseen sequels develop novel pretexts, or grow into startling and\r\nhateful necessities; the minister finds that he is fastened to an\r\ninexorable chain.\r\n\r\n                         NEW VIEWS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone now had this fatal law of mundane things brought home to\r\nhim. As time went on, he by rapid intuition gained a truer insight into\r\nthe leading facts. He realised that Mahometan institutions in the\r\nOttoman empire were decrepit; that the youthful and vigorous elements in\r\nEuropean Turkey were crushed under antiquated and worn-out forms and\r\nforces unfit for rule. He awoke to the disquieting reflection how the\r\noccupation of the Principalities had been discussed, day after day and\r\nmonth after month, entirely as a question of the payment of forty\r\nthousand pounds a year to Turkey, or as a violation of her rights as\r\nsuzerain, but never in reference to the well-being, happiness, freedom,\r\nor peace of the inhabitants. He still held that the war in its origin\r\nwas just, for it had been absolutely necessary, he said, to cut the\r\nmeshes of the net in which Russia had entangled Turkey. He persisted in\r\ncondemning the whole tone and policy of Russia in 1854. By the end of\r\n1854, in Mr. Gladstone's eyes, this aggressive spirit had been\r\nextinguished, the Czar promising an almost unreserved acceptance of the\r\nvery points that he had in the previous August angrily rejected. The\r\nessential objects of the war were the abolition of Russian rights in the\r\nPrincipalities, and the destruction of Russian claims upon Greek\r\nChristians under Ottoman sway. These objects, Mr. Gladstone insisted,\r\nwere attained in January 1855, when Russia agreed to three out of the\r\nFour Points--so the bases of agreement were named--and only demurred\r\nupon the plan for carrying out a portion of the fourth. The special\r\nobject was to cancel the preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea. No\r\nfewer than seven different plans were simultaneously or in turn\r\npropounded. They were every one of them admitted to be dubious,\r\ninefficient, and imperfect. I will spare the reader the mysteries of\r\nlimitation, of counterpoise, of counterpoise and limitation mixed.\r\nRussia preferred counterpoise, the allies were for limitation. Was this\r\npreference between two degrees of the imperfect, the deficient, and the\r\nineffective a good ground for prolonging a war that was costing the\r\nallies a hundred million pounds a year, and involved to all the parties\r\nconcerned the loss of a thousand lives a day? Yet, for saying No to this\r\nquestion, Mr. Gladstone was called a traitor, even by men who in 1853\r\nhad been willing to content themselves with the Vienna note, and in 1854\r\nhad been anxious to make peace on the basis of the Four Points. In face\r\nof pleas so wretched for a prolongation of a war to which he had\r\nassented on other grounds, was he bound to silence? 'Would it not, on\r\nthe contrary,' he exclaimed, 'have been the most contemptible effeminacy\r\nof character, if a man in my position, who feels that he has been\r\ninstrumental in bringing his country into this struggle, were to\r\nhesitate a single moment when he was firmly convinced in his own mind\r\nthat the time had arrived when we might with honour escape from it?'\r\n\r\nThe prospect of reducing Russia to some abstract level of strength, so\r\nas to uphold an arbitrary standard of the balance of power--this he\r\nregarded as mischief and chimera. Rightly he dreaded the peril of\r\nalliances shifting from day to day, like quicksands and\r\nsea-shoals--Austria moved by a hundred strong and varying currents,\r\nFrance drawing by unforeseen affinities towards Russia. Every war with\r\nalliances, he once said, should be short, sharp, decisive.[348]\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the colleagues from whom he had parted insisted\r\nthat every one of his arguments told just as logically against the war\r\nin all its stages, against the first as legitimately as the last. In\r\nfact, we can never say a plain sure aye or no to questions of peace and\r\nwar, after the sword has once left the scabbard. They are all matter of\r\njudgment on the balance of policy between one course and another; and a\r\nvery slight thing may incline the balance either way, even though mighty\r\naffairs should hang on the turn of the scale. Meanwhile, as the months\r\nwent on, Sebastopol still stood untaken, excitement grew, people forgot\r\nthe starting point. They ceased to argue, and sheer blatancy, at all\r\ntimes a power, in war-time is supreme. Mr. Gladstone's trenchant\r\ndialectic had no more chance than Bright's glowing appeals. Shrewd and\r\nnot unfriendly onlookers thought that Graham and Gladstone were\r\ngrievously mistaken in making common cause with the peace party,\r\nimmediately after quitting a war government, and quitting it, besides,\r\nnot on the issues of the war. Herbert was vehement in his remonstrances.\r\nThe whole advantage of co-operation with the Manchester men, he cried,\r\nwould be derived by them, and all the disrepute reaped by us. 'For the\r\npurposes of peace, they were the very men we ought to avoid. As\r\nadvocates for ending the war, they were out of court, for they were\r\nagainst beginning it.'[349] If Gladstone and Graham had gone slower,\r\ntheir friends said, they might have preached moderation to ministers and\r\ngiven reasonable advice to people out of doors. As it was, they threw\r\nthe game into the hands of Lord Palmerston. They were stamped as\r\ndoctrinaires, and what was worse, doctrinaires suspected of a spice of\r\npersonal animus against old friends. Herbert insisted that the\r\nManchester school 'forgot that the people have flesh and blood, and\r\npropounded theories to men swayed by national feeling.' As a matter of\r\nfact, this was wholly untrue. Cobden and Bright, as everybody nowadays\r\nadmits, had a far truer perception of the underlying realities of the\r\nEastern question in 1854, than either the Aberdeen or the Palmerston\r\ncabinet, or both of them put together. What was undeniable was that the\r\npublic, with its habits of rough and ready judgment, did not understand,\r\nand could not be expected to understand, the new union of the Peelites\r\nwith a peace party, in direct opposition to whose strongest views and\r\ngravest warnings they had originally begun the war. 'In Gladstone,'\r\nCornewall Lewis said, 'people ascribe to faction, or ambition, or\r\nvanity, conduct which I believe to be the result of a conscientious,\r\nscrupulous, ingenuous, undecided mind, always looking on each side of a\r\nquestion and magnifying the objections which belong to almost every\r\ncourse of action.'[350]\r\n\r\n                       ADVOCATES OF PEACE\r\n\r\nA foreign envoy then resident in England was struck by the general\r\nignorance of facts even among leading politicians. Of the friends of\r\npeace, he says, only Lord Grey and Gladstone seemed to have mastered the\r\nVienna protocols: the rest were quite astonished when the extent of the\r\nRussian concessions was pointed out to them. The envoy dined with Mr.\r\nGladstone at the table of the Queen, and they talked of Milner Gibson's\r\nmotion censuring ministers for losing the opportunity of the Vienna\r\nconferences to make a sound and satisfactory peace. Mr. Gladstone said\r\nto him that he should undertake the grave responsibility of supporting\r\nthis motion, 'because in his opinion the concessions promised by Russia\r\ncontain sufficient guarantees. Those very concessions will tear to\r\npieces all the ancient treaties which gave an excuse to Russia for\r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of Turkey.'[351]\r\n\r\nAt all times stimulated rather than checked by a difficult situation,\r\nMr. Gladstone argued the case for peace to the House during the session\r\nof 1855 in two speeches of extraordinary power of every kind. His\r\nposition was perfectly tenable, and he defended it with unsurpassed\r\nforce. For the hour unfortunately his influence was gone. Great\r\nnewspapers thought themselves safe in describing one of these\r\nperformances as something between the rant of the fanatic and the trick\r\nof the stage actor; a mixture of pious grimace and vindictive howl, of\r\nsavage curses and dolorous forebodings; the most unpatriotic speech ever\r\nheard within the walls of parliament. In sober fact, it was one of the\r\nthree or four most masterly deliverances evoked by the Crimean war. At\r\nthe very same time Lord John Russell was still sitting in the cabinet,\r\nthough he had held the opinion that at the beginning of May the Austrian\r\nproposal ought to have ended the war and led to an honourable peace. The\r\nscandal of a minister remaining in a government that persisted in a war\r\ncondemned by him as unnecessary was intolerable, and Lord John resigned\r\n(July 16).\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the speedy fall of Sebastopol brightened in the summer of\r\n1855, but this brought new alarms to Lord Palmerston. 'Our danger,' he\r\nsaid in remarkable words, 'will then begin--a danger of peace and not a\r\ndanger of war.' To drive the Russians out of the Crimea was to be no\r\nmore than a preliminary. England would go on by herself, if conditions\r\ndeemed by her essential were not secured. 'The British nation is\r\nunanimous, for I cannot reckon Cobden, Bright, and Co. for\r\nanything.'[352] His account of the public mind was indubitably true.\r\nWell might Aberdeen recall to his friends that, with a single exception,\r\nevery treaty concluded at the termination of our great wars had been\r\nstigmatised as humiliating and degrading, ignominious, hollow and\r\nunsafe. He cited the peace of Utrecht in 1713, the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in 1748, the peace of Paris in 1763, the peace of\r\nVersailles in 1783, and the peace of Amiens in 1801. The single\r\nexception was the peace of Paris in 1814. It would have been difficult\r\nin this case, he said, for patriotism or faction to discover humiliation\r\n'in a treaty dictated at the head of a victorious army in the capital of\r\nthe enemy.'\r\n\r\n                           AT PENMAENMAWR\r\n\r\nWhile the storm was raging, Mr. Gladstone made his way with his family\r\nto Penmaenmawr, whence he writes to Lord Aberdeen (Aug. 9): 'It was a\r\ncharitable act on your part to write to me. It is hardly possible to\r\nbelieve one is not the greatest scoundrel on earth, when one is assured\r\nof it from all sides on such excellent authority.... I am busy reading\r\nHomer about the Sebastopol of old time, and all manner of other fine\r\nfellows.' In another letter of the same time, written to Sir Walter\r\nJames, one of the most closely attached of all his friends, he strikes a\r\ndeeper note:--\r\n\r\n     _Sept. 17._--If I say I care little for such an attack you will\r\n     perhaps think I make little of sympathy like yours and Lord\r\n     Hardinge's, but such, I beg you and him to believe, is not the\r\n     case. Public life is full of snares and dangers, and I think it a\r\n     fearful thing for a Christian to look forward to closing his life\r\n     in the midst of its (to me at least) essentially fevered activity.\r\n     It has, however, some excellent characteristics in regard to mental\r\n     and even spiritual discipline, and among these in particular it\r\n     absolutely requires the habits of resisting temper and of\r\n     suppressing pain. I never allow myself, in regard to my public\r\n     life, to realise, _i.e._ to dwell upon, the fact that a thing is\r\n     _painful_. Indeed life has no time for such broodings: neither in\r\n     session nor recess is the year, the day, or the hour long enough\r\n     for what it brings with it. Nor was there ever a case in which it\r\n     was so little difficult to pass over and make little of a personal\r\n     matter: for if indeed it be true, as I fear it is, that we have\r\n     been committing grave errors, that those errors have cost many\r\n     thousands of lives and millions of money, and that no glare of\r\n     success can effectually hide the gloom of thickening complications,\r\n     the man who can be capable of weighing his own fate and prospects\r\n     in the midst of such contingencies has need to take a lesson from\r\n     the private soldier who gives his life to his country at a shilling\r\n     a day.\r\n\r\n'We are on our way back,' he writes at the end of September, 'after a\r\nmonth of sea-bathing and touring among the Welsh mountains. Most of my\r\ntime is taken up with Homer and Homeric literature, in which I am\r\nimmersed with great delight up to my ears; perhaps I should say out of\r\nmy depth.' Mr. Gladstone was one of the men whom the agitations of\r\npolitics can never submerge. Political interests were what they ought to\r\nbe, a very serious part of life; but they took their place with other\r\nthings, and were never suffered, as in narrower natures sometimes\r\nhappens, to blot out 'stars and orbs of sun and moon' from the spacious\r\nfirmament above us. He now found a shelter from the intensity of the\r\ntimes in the systematic production of his book on Homer, a striking\r\npiece of literature that became the most definite of his pursuits for\r\ntwo years or more. His children observed that he never lounged or\r\nstrolled upon the shore, but when the morning's labour was over--and\r\nnothing was ever allowed to break or mutilate the daily spell of serious\r\nwork--he would stride forth staff in hand, and vigorously breast the\r\nsteepest bluffs and hills that he could find. This was only emblematic\r\nof a temperament to which the putting forth of power was both necessity\r\nand delight. The only rest he ever knew was change of effort.\r\n\r\nWhile he was on the Welsh coast Sebastopol fell, after a siege of three\r\nhundred and fifty days. Negotiations for peace were opened tolerably\r\nsoon afterwards, ending, after many checks and diplomatic difficulties,\r\nin the Treaty of Paris (March 30, 1856), as to which I need only remind\r\nthe reader, with a view to a future incident in Mr. Gladstone's history,\r\nthat the Black Sea was neutralised, and all warships of every nation\r\nexcluded from its waters. Three hundred thousand men had perished.\r\nCountless treasure had been flung into the abyss. The nation that had\r\nwon its last victory at Waterloo did not now enhance the glory of its\r\narms, nor the power of its diplomacy, nor the strength of any of its\r\nmaterial interests. It was our French ally who profited. The integrity\r\nof Turkey was so ill confirmed that even at the Congress of Paris the\r\nquestion of the Danubian Principalities was raised in a form that in a\r\ncouple of years reduced Turkish rule over six millions of her subjects\r\nto the shadow of smoke. Of the confidently promised reform of Mahometan\r\ndominion there was never a beginning nor a sign. The vindication of the\r\nstanding European order proved so ineffectual that the Crimean war was\r\nonly the sanguinary prelude to a vast subversion of the whole system of\r\nEuropean states.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 II\r\n\r\n                            WORK ON HOMER\r\n\r\nOther interests now came foremost in Mr. Gladstone's mind. The old\r\nground so constantly travelled over since the death of Peel was for\r\nthree years to come traversed again with fatiguing iteration. In the\r\nspring of 1856 Lord Derby repeated the overtures that he had made in\r\nspecific form in 1851 and in 1855. The government was weak, as Mr.\r\nGladstone had predicted that it would be. Lord Derby told Sir William\r\nHeathcote, through whom he and Mr. Gladstone communicated, that as\r\nalmost any day it might be overturned, and he might be sent for by the\r\nQueen, he was bound to see what strength he might rely upon, and he was\r\nanxious to know what were Mr. Gladstone's views on the possibility of\r\nco-operation. What was the nature of his relations with other members of\r\nthe Peel government who had also been in the cabinet of Lord Aberdeen?\r\nDid they systematically communicate? Were they a party? Did they intend\r\nto hold and to act together? These questions were soon answered:--\r\n\r\n     On the first point, Mr. Gladstone said, you cannot better describe\r\n     my views for present purposes than by saying that they are much\r\n     like Lord Derby's own as I understand them--there was nothing in\r\n     them to prevent a further consideration of the subject, if public\r\n     affairs should assume such a shape as to recommend it. On the\r\n     second, I said Graham, Herbert, Cardwell, and I communicated\r\n     together habitually and confidentially; that we did not seek to\r\n     act, but rather eschewed acting, as a party; that our habits of\r\n     communication were founded upon long political association, general\r\n     agreement, and personal friendship; that they were not, however, a\r\n     covenant for the future, but a natural growth and result of the\r\n     past.\r\n\r\nThen he proceeds to tell with a new and rather startling conclusion the\r\nold story of the Peelite responsibility for the broken and disorganised\r\nstate of the House of Commons:--\r\n\r\n     We, the friends of Lord Aberdeen, were a main cause of disunion and\r\n     weakness in the executive government, and must be so, from\r\n     whichever side the government were formed, so long as we were not\r\n     absolutely incorporated into one or the other of the two great\r\n     parties. For though we had few positively and regularly following\r\n     us, yet we had indirect relations with others on both sides of the\r\n     House, which tended to relax, and so far disable, party\r\n     connections, and our existence as a section encouraged the\r\n     formation of other sections all working with similar effects. I\r\n     carried my feeling individually so far upon the subject as even to\r\n     be ready, if I had to act alone, to surrender my seat in\r\n     parliament, rather than continue a cause of disturbance to any\r\n     government to which I might generally wish well.[353]\r\n\r\n                       RELATIONS WITH LORD DERBY\r\n\r\nThis exchange of views with Lord Derby he fully reported to Graham,\r\nHerbert, and Cardwell, whom Lord Aberdeen, at his request, had summoned\r\nfor the purpose. Herbert doubted the expediency of such communications,\r\nand Graham went straight to what was a real point. 'He observed that the\r\nquestion was of the most vital consequence, Who should lead the House of\r\nCommons? This he thought must come to me, and could not be with\r\nDisraeli. I had said and repeated, that I thought we could not bargain\r\nDisraeli out of the saddle; that it must rest with him (so far as we\r\nwere concerned) to hold the lead if he pleased; that besides my looking\r\nto it with doubt and dread, I felt he had this right; and that I took it\r\nas one of the _data_ in the case before us upon which we might have to\r\nconsider the question of political junction, and which might be\r\nseriously affected by it.' Of these approaches in the spring of 1856\r\nnothing came. The struggle in Mr. Gladstone's mind went on with growing\r\nurgency. He always protested that he never at any time contemplated an\r\nisolated return to the conservative ranks, but 'reunion of a body with a\r\nbody.'\r\n\r\nBesides his sense of the vital importance of the reconstruction of the\r\nparty system, he had two other high related aims. The commanding\r\nposition that had first been held in the objects of his activity by the\r\nchurch, then, for a considerable space, by the colonies, was now filled\r\nby finance. As he put it in a letter to his sympathetic brother\r\nRobertson: He saw two cardinal subjects for the present moment in\r\npublic affairs, a rational and pacific foreign policy, and second, the\r\ndue reduction in our establishments, economy in administration, and\r\nfinance to correspond. In 1853 he had, as he believed, given financial\r\npledges to the country. These pledges were by the present ministers in\r\ndanger of being forgotten. They were incompatible with Palmerston's\r\nspirit of foreign policy. His duty, then, was to oppose that policy, and\r\nto labour as hard as he could for the redemption of his pledges. Yet\r\nisolated as he was, he had little power over either one of these aims or\r\nthe other. The liberal party was determined to support the reigning\r\nforeign policy, and this made financial improvement desperate. Of Lord\r\nDerby's friends he was not hopeful, but they were not committed to so\r\ndangerous a leader.[354] As he put it to Elwin, the editor of the\r\n_Quarterly_: There is a policy going a begging; the general policy that\r\nSir Robert Peel in 1841 took office to support--the policy of peace\r\nabroad, of economy, of financial equilibrium, of steady resistance to\r\nabuses, and promotion of practical improvements at home, with a\r\ndisinclination to questions of reform, gratuitously raised.[355]\r\n\r\nHis whole mind beset, possessed, and on fire with ideals of this kind,\r\nand with sanguine visions of the road by which they might be\r\nrealised--it was not in the temperament of this born warrior to count\r\nthe lions in his path. He was only too much in the right, as his\r\ntribulations of a later date so amply proved, in his perception that\r\nneither Palmerston nor Palmerstonian liberals would take up the broken\r\nclue of Peel. The importunate presence of Mr. Disraeli was not any\r\nsharper obstacle to a definite junction with conservatives, than was the\r\npersonality of Lord Palmerston to a junction with liberals. As he had\r\nsaid to Graham in November 1856, 'the pain and strain of public duty is\r\nmultiplied tenfold by the want of a clear and firm ground from which\r\nvisibly to act.' In rougher phrase, a man must have a platform and work\r\nwith a party. This indeed is for sensible men one of the rudiments of\r\npractical politics.\r\n\r\nOf a certain kind of cant about public life and office Mr. Gladstone was\r\nalways accustomed to make short work. The repudiation of desire for\r\nofficial power, he at this time and always roundly denounced as\r\n'sentimental and maudlin.' One of the not too many things that he\r\nadmired in Lord Palmerston was 'the manly frankness of his habitual\r\ndeclarations that office is the natural and proper sphere of a public\r\nman's ambition, as that in which he can most freely use his powers for\r\nthe common advantage of his country.' 'The desire for office,' said Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'is the desire of ardent minds for a larger space and scope\r\nwithin which to serve the country, and for access to the command of that\r\npowerful machinery for information and practice, which the public\r\ndepartments supply. He must be a very bad minister indeed, who does not\r\ndo ten times the good to the country that he would do when out of\r\noffice, because he has helps and opportunities which multiply twenty\r\nfold, as by a system of wheels and pulleys, his power for doing it.' It\r\nis true, as the smallest of men may see--and the smaller the man, the\r\nmore will he make of it--that this sterling good sense may set many a\r\nsnare for the politician; but then even the consecrated affectations of\r\nour public life have their snares too.\r\n\r\nThe world was not in the secret of the communications with Lord Derby,\r\nbut the intrinsic probabilities of a case often give to the public a\r\ntrick of divination. In the middle of December (1856) articles actually\r\nappeared in the prints of the day announcing that Mr. Gladstone would at\r\nthe opening of the next session figure at the head of the opposition.\r\nThe tories, they said, wanted a leader, Mr. Gladstone wanted a party.\r\nThey were credulous, he was ingenious. The minority in a party must\r\nyield to a majority, and he stood almost by himself. He would be a\r\nreturned prodigal in the conservative household, for unlike Sir James\r\nGraham, he had never merged himself in the ordinary ruck of liberalism.\r\nA tory peer writes to assure him that there never was such a chance for\r\nthe reunion of the party. Even the nobleman who had moved Mr.\r\nGladstone's expulsion from the Carlton said that he supposed reunion\r\nmust pretty soon come off. A few, perhaps under a score, made a great\r\nnoise, but if Lord Derby would only form a government, the noisy ones\r\nwould be as glad as the rest. True--and here the writer came nearer to\r\nthe central difficulty--'Disraeli ought _at first_ to lead the Commons,'\r\nbecause he had been leader before; second, he had the greater number of\r\nfollowers; third, because on public grounds he must desire to see Mr.\r\nGladstone at the exchequer; and to transfer to him both the great\r\nsubject of finance and the great prize of leadership would be\r\nimpossible. So easy do flat impossibilities ever seem to sanguine\r\nsimpletons in Pall Mall. Another correspondent has been staying at a\r\ngrand country-house, full of tory company, and the state of parties was\r\nmuch discussed--'There was one unanimous opinion,' he tells Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'that nothing could save the conservative party except\r\nelecting you for their leader.' The same talk was reported from the\r\nclubs. 'The difficulty was Disraeli, not so much for any damage that his\r\nhostility could do the party, as because Lord Derby had contracted\r\nrelations with him which it would perhaps be impossible for him to\r\ndisown.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sagacious man in the tents of the tories, whose course was\r\nso neatly chalked out for him by sulky followers not relishing his lead,\r\nwas, we may be sure, entirely wide-awake, watching currents, gales, and\r\npuffs of wind without haste, without rest. Disraeli made a bold stroke\r\nfor party consolidation by inviting to his official dinner at the\r\nopening of the session of 1857, General Peel, the favourite brother of\r\nthe great minister and his best accredited representative. Peel\r\nconsulted Mr. Gladstone on the reply to Disraeli's invitation, and found\r\nhim strongly adverse. The public, said Mr. Gladstone, views with much\r\njealousy every change of political position not founded on previous\r\nparliamentary co-operation for some national object. Mr. Gladstone might\r\nhave put it on the narrower ground that attendance at the dinner would\r\nbe an explicit condonation of Disraeli's misdeeds ten years before, and\r\na direct acceptance of his leadership henceforth.\r\n\r\nElwin believed that he had the direct sanction of Lord Derby for a\r\nmessage from him to Mr. Gladstone suggesting communication. After much\r\nruminating and consulting, Mr. Gladstone wrote (Dec. 13, 1856) in\r\nsufficiently circuitous language to Elwin, that though he should not be\r\njustified in communicating with Lord Derby, considered simply as a\r\npolitical leader with whom he was not in relations of party, yet, he\r\nproceeds, 'remembering that I was once his colleague, and placing entire\r\nreliance on his honour, I am ready to speak to him in confidence and\r\nwithout reserve on the subject of public affairs, should it be his\r\ndesire.' His three friends, Graham, Aberdeen, and Herbert, still viewed\r\nthe proceeding with entire disfavour, and no counsels were ever dictated\r\nby sincerer affection and solicitude. Your financial scheme, says\r\nGraham, is conceived in the very spirit of Peel; it would be most\r\nconducive to national welfare; you alone and in high office can carry\r\nit; but it must be grafted on a pacific policy and on a moderate scale\r\nof public expenditure; it is not under Palmerston that such blessings\r\nare to be anticipated; but then are they more probable under Derby and\r\nDisraeli? Lord Aberdeen took another line, insisting that to make any\r\nsort of approach to Lord Derby, after joining Palmerston only the\r\nprevious year, would be unjustifiable; the bare apprehension of a\r\nvicious policy would be no intelligible ground for changing sides; more\r\ntangible reasons would be needed, and they were only too likely soon to\r\narrive from Palmerston's foreign policy. Then a reasonable chance might\r\ncome. Herbert, in his turn, told Mr. Gladstone that though he might\r\ninfuse vigour and respectability into a party that stood much in need of\r\nboth, yet he would always be in a false position. 'Your opinions are\r\nessentially progressive, and when the measures of any government mast be\r\nliberal and progressive, the country will prefer the men whose\r\nantecedents and mottoes are liberal, while the conservatives will always\r\nprefer a leader whose prejudices are with themselves.' As Graham put it\r\nto him: 'If you were to join the tory party to-morrow, you would have\r\nneither their confidence nor their real good will, and they would openly\r\nbreak with you in less than a year.' It all reminds one of the chorus in\r\nGreek plays, sagely expostulating with a hero bent on some dread deed of\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                               MEDITATIONS\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1856 ecclesiastical questions held a strong place in\r\nMr. Gladstone's interests. The condemnation of Archdeacon Denison for\r\nheresy roused him to lively indignation. He had long interviews with the\r\narchdeacon, drafted answers for him, and flung his whole soul into the\r\ncase, though he was made angry by Denison's oscillations and general\r\ntone. 'Gladstone tells me,' said Aberdeen, 'that he cannot sleep for it,\r\nand writes to me volumes upon volumes. He thinks that Denison ought to\r\nhave been allowed to show that his doctrine, whether in accordance or\r\nnot with the articles, is in accordance with scripture. And he thinks\r\nthe decision ought to have been in his case as it was in Gorham's, that\r\nthe articles are comprehensive, that they admit Denison's view of the\r\nEucharist as well as that of his opponents.'[356]\r\n\r\nHis closing entry for the year (1856) depicts an inner mood:--\r\n\r\n     It appears to me that there are few persons who are so much as I am\r\n     enclosed in the invisible net of pendent steel. I have never known\r\n     what tedium was, have always found time full of calls and duties,\r\n     life charged with every kind of interest. But now when I look\r\n     calmly around me, I see that these interests are for ever growing\r\n     and grown too many and powerful, and that were it to please God to\r\n     call me I might answer with reluctance.... See how I stand. Into\r\n     politics I am drawn deeper every year; in the growing anxieties and\r\n     struggles of the church I have no less [interest] than I have\r\n     heretofore; literature has of late acquired a new and powerful hold\r\n     upon me; the fortunes of my wife's family, which have had, with all\r\n     their dry detail, all the most exciting and arduous interest of\r\n     romance for me now during nine years and more; seven children\r\n     growing up around us, and each day the object of deeper thoughts\r\n     and feelings, and of higher hopes to Catherine and me,--what a\r\n     network is here woven out of all that the heart and all that the\r\n     mind of man can supply....\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[348] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[349] Herbert to Gladstone, May 27, 1855.\r\n\r\n[350] _Many Memories_, p. 229.\r\n\r\n[351] Vitzthum, _St. Petersburg and London_, i. p. 170.

Under pressure from his friends, he agreed with Lord Derby\r\nto put off an interview until after the debate on the address. Then,\r\nafter parliament met, they took the plunge. We are now at the beginning\r\nof February.\r\n\r\n     This afternoon at three I called on Lord Derby and remained with\r\n     him above three hours, in prosecution of the correspondence which\r\n     had passed between us.\r\n\r\n     I told him that I deliberately disapproved of the government of\r\n     Lord Palmerston, and was prepared and desirous to aid in any proper\r\n     measures which might lead to its displacement. That so strong were\r\n     my objections that I was content to act thus without inquiring who\r\n     was to follow, for I was convinced that any one who might follow\r\n     would govern with less prejudice to the public interests. That in\r\n     the existing state of public affairs I did not pretend to see far,\r\n     but thus far I saw clearly. I also told him that I felt the\r\n     isolated position in which I stood, and indeed in which we who are\r\n     called Peelites all stand, to be a great evil as tending to prolong\r\n     and aggravate that parliamentary disorganisation which so much\r\n     clogs and weakens the working of our government; and I denounced\r\n     myself as a public nuisance, adding that it would be an advantage\r\n     if my doctor sent me abroad for the session.\r\n\r\n                           PEELITES AND TORIES\r\n\r\n     He concurred in the general sentiments which I had expressed, but\r\n     said it was material for him, as he had friends with and for whom\r\n     to act, and as I had alluded to the possibility, in the event of a\r\n     change, of his being invited by the Queen to form a government, to\r\n     consider beforehand on what strength he could rely. He said he\r\n     believed his friends were stronger than any other single section,\r\n     but that they were a minority in both Houses. Weak in 1852, he was\r\n     weaker now, for it was natural that four years of exclusion from\r\n     office should thin the ranks of a party, and such had been his\r\n     case. He described the state of feeling among his friends, and\r\n     adverted to the offer he had made in 1851 and in 1855. The fact of\r\n     an overture made and not accepted had led to much bitterness or\r\n     anger towards us among a portion of his adherents. He considered\r\n     that in 1855 Lord Palmerston had behaved far from well either to\r\n     Herbert and me, or to him.[357]\r\n\r\nOther interviews followed; resolutions were discussed, amendments, forms\r\nof words. They met at discreet dinners. 'Nobody,' Lord Derby tells him,\r\n'except Disraeli knows the length to which our communications have\r\ngone.' Nobody, that is to say, excepting also Mr. Gladstone's three\r\npersonal allies; them he kept accurately informed of all that passed at\r\nevery stage. On February 13 the government presented their budget. In\r\nintroducing his plan, Cornewall Lewis rashly quoted, and adopted as his\r\nown, the terrible heresy of Arthur Young, that to multiply the number of\r\ntaxes is a step towards equality of burden, and that a good system of\r\ntaxation is one that bears lightly on an infinite number of points. The\r\nreader will believe how speedily an impious opinion of this sort kindled\r\nvolcanic flame in Mr. Gladstone's breast. He thought moreover that he\r\nespied in the ministerial plan a prospective deficiency a year ahead. To\r\nmaintain a steady surplus of income over expenditure, he reflected; to\r\nlower indirect taxes when excessive in amount, for the relief of the\r\npeople, and bearing in mind the reproductive power inherent in such\r\noperations; to simplify our fiscal system by concentrating its pressure\r\non a few well chosen articles of extended consumption; and to conciliate\r\nsupport to the income-tax by marking its temporary character, and by\r\nassociating it with beneficial changes in the tariff: these aims have\r\nbeen for fifteen years the labour of our life. By this budget he found\r\nthem in principle utterly reversed. He told his friends that the shade\r\nof Peel would appear to him if he did not oppose such plans with his\r\nwhole strength. When the time came (Feb. 3), 'the government was fired\r\ninto from all quarters. Disraeli in front; Gladstone on flank; John\r\nRussell in rear. Disraeli and Gladstone rose at same time. Speaker\r\ncalled the former. Both spoke very well. It was a night of triumph for\r\nGladstone.'[358]\r\n\r\nThere is another note of the proceedings on Lewis's budget:--\r\n\r\n     _Saturday, Feb. 14._--I was engaged to meet Graham, Herbert, and\r\n     Cardwell at Lord Aberdeen's, and I knew from Lord Derby that he was\r\n     to see his friends at noon. So I went to him on my way, first to\r\n     point out the _deficit_ of between five and six millions for 1858-9\r\n     which is created by this budget, with the augmentations of it in\r\n     subsequent years; and secondly, to say that in my opinion it was\r\n     hopeless to attack the scheme in detail, and that it must be\r\n     resisted on the ground of deficit as a whole, to give a hope of\r\n     success. I said that if among the opposition there still lingered a\r\n     desire to revive and extend indirect taxation, I must allow that\r\n     the government had bid high for support from those who entertained\r\n     it; that it was the worst proposition I had ever heard from a\r\n     minister of finance. At Lord Aberdeen's we examined the figures of\r\n     the case, and drafted two resolutions which expressed our opinions.\r\n\r\n     The more serious point, however, was that they all wished me to\r\n     insist upon taking the motion into my own hands; and announcing\r\n     this to Lord J. Russell as well as to Lord Derby. As to the second\r\n     I had no difficulty, could I have acceded to the first. But I did\r\n     not doubt that Disraeli would still keep hold of so much of his\r\n     notice of Feb. 3 as had not been set aside by the budget. I said\r\n     that from motives which I could neither describe nor conquer I was\r\n     quite unable to undertake to enter into any squabble or competition\r\n     with him for the possession of a post of prominence. We had much\r\n     conversation on political prospects: Graham wishing to see me lead\r\n     the Commons under Lord John as prime minister in the Lords;\r\n     admitting that the same thing would do under Lord Derby, but for\r\n     Disraeli, who could not be thrown away like a sucked orange; and I\r\n     vehemently deploring our position, which I said, and they admitted,\r\n     was generally condemned by the country.\r\n\r\n    I again went to Derby, as he had requested, at five; and he told me\r\n    that he had had with him Malmesbury, Hardwicke, Disraeli, Pakington,\r\n    Walpole, Lytton. They had all agreed that the best motion would be a\r\n    resolution (from Disraeli) on Monday, before the Speaker left the\r\n    chair, which would virtually rest the question on deficit. I made\r\n    two verbal suggestions on the resolution to improve its form.\r\n\r\n                     CO-OPERATION WITH MR. DISRAELI\r\n\r\nLate in the evening Lord Derby writes, enclosing a note received at\r\ndinner from Disraeli, 'I hope I may take it for granted that there is\r\nnow a complete understanding between us as to the move on Monday night.'\r\n'My dear lord,' runs the note, 'I like the resolution as amended. It is\r\nimproved. Yours ever, D.' When Monday came, the move was duly made, and\r\nGladstone and Disraeli again fought side by side as twin champions of\r\nthe cause of reduced expenditure. Time had incensed Mr. Gladstone still\r\nfurther, and he conducted a terrific fusillade. He recounted how between\r\n1842 and 1853 two and twenty millions of taxation had been taken off\r\nwithout costing a farthing. 'A man may be glad and thankful to have been\r\nan Englishman and a member of the British parliament during these years,\r\nbearing his part in so blessed a work. But if it be a blessed work, what\r\nare we to say of him who begins the undoing of it?' The proposal of the\r\ngovernment showed a gross, a glaring, an increasing deficiency, a\r\ndeficiency unparalleled in the financial history of a quarter of a\r\ncentury. It was deluding the people and trifling with national\r\ninterests. It is certain that no financier before or since ever, in\r\nCromwellian phrase, made such a conscience of the matter, or ever found\r\nthe task more thankless.[359] Great as was the effect of the close and\r\nsearching argument that accompanied all this invective, even Mr.\r\nGladstone's friends thought it too impassioned and too severe upon\r\nLewis, in whose favour there was consequently a reaction. The cool\r\nminister contented himself with quoting Horace's lines upon the artist\r\nskilled in reproducing in his bronze fierce nails or flowing hair, yet\r\nwho fails because he lacks the art to seize the whole.[360]\r\n\r\nAt the end of February (1857), at a party meeting of 160 members, Lord\r\nDerby told his men that the course taken by Mr. Disraeli upon the budget\r\nhad been concerted with him and had his entire approval; spoke with\r\nadmiration of Mr. Gladstone; justified political union when produced by\r\nmen finding themselves drawn to the same lobby by identity of sentiment;\r\nand advised them not to decline such accession of strength as would\r\nplace their party in a position to undertake the government of the\r\ncountry. The newspapers cried out that the long-expected coalition had\r\nat length really taken place. In their hearts the conservative managers\r\nwere not sure that Mr. Gladstone's adhesion would not cost them too\r\ndearly. 'He would only benefit us by his talents' (says Lord Malmesbury)\r\n'for we should lose many of our supporters. The Duke of Beaufort, one of\r\nour staunchest adherents, told me at Longleat that if we coalesced with\r\nthe Peelites he would leave the party, and I remember in 1855, when Lord\r\nDerby attempted to form a government, and offered places to Gladstone\r\nand Herbert, that no less than eighty members of the House of Commons\r\nthreatened to leave him.'[361] All these schemes and calculations were\r\ndestined to be rudely interrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                        SPEECH ON THE CHINA WAR\r\n\r\nWhile he was acting with Lord Derby on the one hand, Mr. Gladstone\r\nsought counsel from Cobden on the other, having great confidence in his\r\n'firmness and integrity of purpose,' and hoping for support from him in\r\nface of a faint-hearted disposition to regard Lord Palmerston as a\r\nmagician against whom it was vain to struggle. Events were speedily to\r\nshow that Lord Palmerston had more magic at his disposal than his\r\nvaliant foe believed. The agent of the British government in the China\r\nseas--himself, by the way, a philosophic radical--had forced a war upon\r\nthe Chinese. The cabinet supported him. On the motion of Cobden, the\r\nHouse censured the proceeding. Mr. Gladstone, whose hatred of\r\nhigh-handed iniquities in China had been stirred in early days,[362] as\r\nthe reader may recall, made the most powerful speech in a remarkable\r\ndebate. 'Gladstone rose at half-past nine,' Phillimore says (Mar. 3),\r\n'and delivered for nearly two hours an oration which enthralled the\r\nHouse, and which for argument, dignity, eloquence, and effect is\r\nunsurpassed by any of his former achievements. It won several votes.\r\nNobody denies that his speech was the finest delivered in the memory of\r\nman in the House of Commons.' Apart from a rigorous examination of\r\ncircumstance and fact in the special case, as in the famous precedent of\r\nDon Pacifico seven years before, he raised the dispute to higher planes\r\nand in most striking language. He examined it both by municipal and\r\ninternational law, and on 'the higher ground of natural justice'--'that\r\njustice which binds man to man; which is older than Christianity,\r\nbecause it was in the world before Christianity; which is broader than\r\nChristianity, because it extends to the world beyond Christianity; and\r\nwhich underlies Christianity, for Christianity itself appeals to it....\r\nWar taken at the best is a frightful scourge upon the human race; but\r\nbecause it is so, the wisdom of ages has surrounded it with strict laws\r\nand usages, and has required formalities to be observed which shall act\r\nas a curb upon the wild passions of man.... You have dispensed with all\r\nthese precautions. You have turned a consul into a diplomatist, and that\r\nmetamorphosed consul is forsooth to be at liberty to direct the whole\r\nmight of England against the lives of a defenceless people.' Disraeli\r\nin turn denounced proceedings which began in outrage and ended in ruin,\r\nmocked at 'No reform, new taxes, Canton blazing, Persia invaded,' as the\r\nprogramme of the party of progress and civilisation, and reprobated a\r\nprime minister who had professed almost every principle, and connected\r\nhimself with almost every party. Palmerston replied by a stout piece of\r\nclose argument, spiced by taunts about coalitions, combinations, and\r\neloquent flourishes. But this time in parliament his slender majority\r\nfailed him.\r\n\r\n     _March 3, '57._--Spoke on Cobden's resolutions, and voted in\r\n     263-247--a division doing more honour to the House of Commons than\r\n     any I ever remember. Home with C. and read Lord Ellesmere's\r\n     _Faust_, being excited, which is rare with me. (_Diary._)\r\n\r\n                     LORD PALMERSTON'S TRIUMPH\r\n\r\nThe repulse was transient. The minister appealed to the constituencies,\r\nand won a striking triumph. Nearly all the Manchester politicians, with\r\nBright and Cobden at their head, were ruthlessly dismissed, and the\r\nelection was a glorious ratification not only of the little war among\r\nthe Chinese junks, but of the great war against the Czar of Russia, and\r\nof much besides. This, said Mr. Gladstone, was not an election like that\r\nof 1784, when Pitt appealed on the question whether the crown should be\r\nthe slave of an oligarchic faction; nor like that of 1831, when Grey\r\nsought a judgment on reform; nor like that of 1852, when the issue was\r\nthe expiring controversy of protection. The country was to decide not\r\nupon the Canton river, but whether it would or would not have Lord\r\nPalmerston for prime minister. 'The insolent barbarian wielding\r\nauthority at Canton who had violated the British flag' was indeed made\r\nto play his part. But the mainspring of the electoral victory was to be\r\nsought in the profound public weariness of the party dispersions of the\r\nlast eleven years; in the determination that the country should be\r\ngoverned by men of intelligible opinions and definite views; in the\r\nresolution that the intermediate tints should disappear; in the\r\nconviction that Palmerston was the helmsman for the hour. The result was\r\njustly compared to the plebiscite taken in France four or five years\r\nearlier, whether they would have Louis Napoleon for emperor or not. It\r\nwas computed that no fewer than one-sixth, or at best one-seventh, of\r\nthe most conspicuous men in the former House of Commons were thrust out.\r\nThe Derbyites were sure that the report of the coalition with the\r\nPeelites had done them irreparable harm, though their electioneering was\r\nindependent. At Oxford Mr. Gladstone was returned without opposition. On\r\nthe other hand, his gallant attempt to save the seat of his\r\nbrother-in-law in Flintshire failed, his many speeches met much rough\r\ninterruption, and to his extreme mortification Sir Stephen Glynne was\r\nthrown out.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the general election was undoubtedly a heavy shock to Mr.\r\nGladstone, and he was fully conscious of the new awkwardness of his\r\npublic position. Painful change seemed imminent even in his intimate\r\nrelations with cherished friends. Sidney Herbert had written to him that\r\nas for Gladstone, Graham, and himself, they were not only broken up as a\r\nparty, but the country intended to break them up and would resent any\r\nattempt at resuscitation; they ought on no account to reappear as a\r\ntriumvirate on their old bench. Mr. Gladstone's reply discloses in some\r\nof its phrases a peculiar warmth of sensibility, of which he was not\r\noften wont to make much display:--\r\n\r\n                          _To Sidney Herbert._\r\n\r\n     _March 22, 1857._--I did not reply to your letter when it arrived,\r\n     because it touches principally upon subjects with respect to which\r\n     I feel that my mind has been wrought into a state of sensitiveness\r\n     which is excessive and morbid. For the last eleven years, with the\r\n     exception of only two among them, the pains of political strife\r\n     have not for us found their usual and proper compensation in the\r\n     genial and extended sympathies of a great body of comrades, while\r\n     suspicion, mistrust, and criticism have flanked us on both sides\r\n     and in unusual measure. Our one comfort has been a concurrence of\r\n     opinion which has been upon the whole remarkably close, and which\r\n     has been cemented by the closer bonds of feeling and of friendship.\r\n     The loss of this one comfort I have no strength to face. Contrary\r\n     to your supposition, I have nothing with which to replace it; but\r\n     the attachments, which began with political infancy, and which\r\n     have lived through so many storms and so many subtler vicissitudes\r\n     will never be replaced. You will never be able to get away from me\r\n     as long as I can cling to you, and if at length, urged by your\r\n     conscience and deliberate judgment, you effect the operation, the\r\n     result will not be to throw me into the staff of Lord Derby. I\r\n     shall seek my duty, as well as consult my inclination, first, by\r\n     absconding from what may be termed general politics, and secondly,\r\n     by appearing, wherever I must appear, only in the ranks.\r\n\r\n     I can neither give even the most qualified adhesion to the ministry\r\n     of Lord Palmerston, nor follow the liberal party in the abandonment\r\n     of the very principles and pledges which were original and\r\n     principal bonds of union with it. So, on the other hand, I never\r\n     have had any hope of conservative reconstruction except (and that\r\n     slender and remote) such as presupposed the co-operation--I am now\r\n     speaking for the House of Commons only--of yourself and Graham in\r\n     particular. By adopting Reform as a watchword of present political\r\n     action he has certainly inserted a certain amount of gap between\r\n     himself and me, which may come to be practically material or may\r\n     not. If you make a gap upon this opportunity, I believe it will be\r\n     a novelty in political history: it will be the first case on record\r\n     of separation between two men, all of whose views upon every public\r\n     question, political, administrative, or financial, are I believe in\r\n     as exact accordance as under the laws of the human mind is\r\n     possible....\r\n\r\nHis leaning towards the conservative party seemed to become more decided\r\nrather than less. Lord Aberdeen had written to him as if the\r\namalgamation of Peel's friends with the liberal party had practically\r\ntaken place. 'If that be true,' Mr. Gladstone replies (April 4, 1857),\r\n'then I have been deceiving both the world and my constituents, and the\r\ndeception has reached its climax within the last fortnight, during which\r\nI have been chosen without opposition to represent Oxford under a belief\r\ndirectly contrary in the minds of the majority of my constituents.' He\r\nsaw nothing but evil in Lord Palmerston's supremacy. That was his\r\nunending refrain. He tells one of his constituents, the state of things\r\n'is likely to end in much political confusion if it is not stopped by\r\nthe failure of Lord Palmerston's physical force, the only way of\r\nstopping it which I could view with regret, for I admire the pluck with\r\nwhich he fights against the infirmities of age, though in political and\r\nmoral courage I have never seen a minister so deficient.' Cobden asked\r\nhim in the course of the first session of the new parliament, to take up\r\nsome position adverse to the ministers. 'I should not knowingly,' Mr.\r\nGladstone replies (June 16, 1857), 'allow any disgust with the state of\r\npublic affairs to restrain me from the discharge of a public duty; but I\r\narrived some time ago at the conclusion, which has guided my conduct\r\nsince the dissolution, that the House of Commons would sooner and more\r\nhealthily return to a sense of its own dignity and of its proper\r\nfunctions, if let alone by a person who had so thoroughly worried both\r\nit and the country as myself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n                             DIVORCE BILL\r\n\r\nThis stern resolve to hold aloof did not last. Towards the end of the\r\nsession a subject was brought before parliament that stirred him to the\r\nvery depths of heart and conscience. It marked one more stage of the\r\nhistory of English laws in that immense process of the secularisation of\r\nthe state, against which, in his book of 1888, Mr. Gladstone had drawn\r\nup, with so much weight of reading and thought, a case so wholly\r\nunavailing. The legal doctrine of marriage had been established against\r\nthe theological doctrine by Lord Hardwicke's famous act of 1753, for\r\nthat measure made the observance of certain requirements then set up by\r\nlaw essential to a good marriage. A further fundamental change had begun\r\nwith the legislation of civil marriage in 1836. The conception of\r\nmarriage underlying such a change obviously removed it from sacrament,\r\nor anything like a sacrament, to the bleak and frigid zone of civil\r\ncontract; it was antagonistic, therefore, to the whole ecclesiastical\r\ntheory of divorce.[363]\r\n\r\nA royal commission issued a report in 1853, setting forth the case\r\nagainst the existing system of dissolving marriage, and recommending\r\nradical changes. In the following year the cabinet of which Mr.\r\nGladstone was a member framed and introduced a bill substantially\r\nconforming to these recommendations. For one reason or another it did\r\nnot become law, nor did a bill of similar scope in 1856. In the interval\r\nof leisure that followed, Mr. Gladstone was pressed, perhaps by Bishop\r\nWilberforce, thoroughly to consider the matter. With his prepossessions,\r\nthere could be little doubt that he would incline to that view of\r\nmarriage, and the terms and legal effects of loosening the marriage tie,\r\nthat the Council of Trent had succeeded in making the general marriage\r\nlaw of catholic Europe. The subject was one peculiarly calculated to\r\ninterest and excite him. Religion and the church were involved. It\r\nraised at our own hearths the eternal question of rendering to Caesar\r\nwhat is Caesar's, and to the church what belongs to the church. It was\r\nwrapped up with topics of history and of learning. It could not be\r\ndiscussed without that admixture of legality and ethics which delights a\r\ncasuistic intellect. Above all, it went to the root both of that deepest\r\nof human relations, and of that particular branch of morals, in which\r\nMr. Gladstone always felt the vividest concern. So, in short, being once\r\ncalled upon for a practical purpose to consider divorce and the many\r\nconnected questions of re-marriage, he was inevitably roused to a\r\nfervour on one side, not any less heated and intense than the fervour of\r\nthe mighty Milton on the other side two centuries before. He began\r\noperations by an elaborate article in the _Quarterly Review_.[364] Here\r\nhe flings himself upon the well-worn texts in the Bible familiar to the\r\nreaders of _Tetrachordon_,--if, indeed, _Tetrachordon_ have any\r\nreaders,--with a dialectical acuteness and force that only make one\r\nwonder the more how a mind so powerful as Mr. Gladstone's could dream\r\nthat, at that age of the world, men would suffer one of the most\r\nfar-reaching of all our social problems, whatever be the right or wrong\r\nsocial solution, to be in the slightest degree affected by a Greek word\r\nor two of utterly disputable and unfixed significance.\r\n\r\n                     INTEREST IN LAW OF DIVORCE\r\n\r\nI may note in passing that in another department of supposed Levitical\r\nprohibition--the case of the wife's sister--he had in 1849 strongly\r\nargued against relaxation, mainly on the ground that it would involve an\r\nalteration of the law and doctrines of the church of England, and\r\ntherefore of the law of Christianity.[365] Experience and time\r\nrevolutionised his point of view, and in 1869, in supporting a bill\r\nlegalising these marriages, he took the secular and utilitarian line,\r\nand said that twelve or fourteen years earlier (about the time on which\r\nwe are now engaged) he formed the opinion that it was the mass of the\r\ncommunity to which we must look in dealing with such a question, and\r\nthat the fairest course would be to legalise the marriage contracts in\r\nquestion, and legitimise their issue, leaving to each religious\r\ncommunity the question of attaching to such marriages a religious\r\ncharacter.[366]\r\n\r\nThe Divorce bill of 1857 was introduced in the Lords, and passed by them\r\nwithout effective resistance. It was supported by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and nine other prelates. Authorities no less exalted than\r\nBishop Wilberforce were violently hostile, even at one stage carrying\r\namendments (ultimately rejected), not only for prohibiting the\r\ninter-marriage of the guilty parties, but actually imposing a fine or\r\nimprisonment on either of them. This, I fancy, is the high-water mark of\r\nthe ecclesiastical theory in the century.[367] Lord Mahon in a letter to\r\nMr. Gladstone at this date pictures Macaulay's New Zealander being taken\r\nto the House of Lords and hearing learned lords and reverend prelates\r\nlay down the canon that marriage is indissoluble by the law of England\r\nand by the law of the church. But who, he might have asked, are those\r\ntwo gentlemen listening so intently? Oh, these are two gentlemen whose\r\nmarriages were dissolved last year. And that other man? Oh, he was\r\ndivorced last week. And those three ladies? Oh, their marriages may in\r\nall probability be dissolved in another year or two. Still this view of\r\nthe absurdity of existing practice did not make a convert.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bill came down to the House of Commons Mr. Gladstone\r\nhastened up to London in the dog-days. 'A companion in the railway\r\ncarriage,' he wrote to Mrs. Gladstone, 'more genial than congenial,\r\noffered me his _Times_, and then brandy! This was followed by a proposal\r\nto smoke, so that he had disabled me from objecting on personal\r\ngrounds.' Tobacco, brandy at odd hours, and the newspaper made a triple\r\nabomination in a single dose, for none of the three was ever a favourite\r\narticle of his consumption. In London he found the counsels of his\r\nfriends by no means encouraging for the great fight on which he was\r\nintent. They deprecated anything that would bring him into direct\r\ncollision with Lord Palmerston. They urged that violent opposition now\r\nwould be contrasted with his past silence, and with his own cabinet\r\nresponsibility for the very same proposal. Nothing would be intelligible\r\nto the public, Lord Aberdeen said, beyond a 'carefully moderated\r\ncourse.' But a carefully moderated course was the very last thing\r\npossible to Mr. Gladstone when the flame was once kindled, and he fought\r\nthe bill with a holy wrath as vehement as the more worldly fury with\r\nwhich Henry Fox, from very different motives, had fought the marriage\r\nbill of 1753. The thought that stirred him was indicated in a phrase or\r\ntwo to his wife at Hawarden: '_July 31._--Parliamentary affairs are very\r\nblack; the poor church gets deeper and deeper into the mire. I am to\r\nspeak to-night; it will do no good; and the fear grows upon me from year\r\nto year that when I finally leave parliament, I shall not leave the\r\ngreat question of state and church better, but perhaps even worse, than\r\nI found it.'\r\n\r\n                       VEHEMENT OPPOSITION\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the bill in the Commons occupied no fewer than\r\neighteen sittings, more than one of them, according to the standard of\r\nthose primitive times, inordinately long. In the hundred encounters\r\nbetween Mr. Gladstone and Bethell, polished phrase barely hid\r\nunchristian desire to retaliate and provoke. Bethell boldly taunted Mr.\r\nGladstone with insincerity. Mr. Gladstone, with a vivacity very like\r\ndownright anger, reproached Bethell with being a mere hewer of wood and\r\ndrawer of water to the cabinet who forced the bill into his charge; with\r\nbeing disorderly and abusing the privileges of speech by accusations of\r\ninsincerity, 'which have not only proceeded from his mouth but gleamed\r\nfrom those eloquent eyes of his, which have been continuously turned on\r\nme for the last ten minutes, instead of being addressed to the chair.'\r\nOn every division those who affirmed the principle of the bill were at\r\nleast two to one. 'All we can do,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to his wife, 'is\r\nto put shoulder to shoulder, and this, please God, we will do. Graham is\r\nwith us, much to my delight, and much too, let me add, to my surprise. I\r\nam as thankful to be in parliament for this (almost) as I was for the\r\nChina vote.... Yesterday ten and a-half hours, rather angry; to-day with\r\npacification, but still tough and prolonged.' An unfriendly but not\r\nwholly unveracious chronicler says of this ten hours' sitting (August\r\n14) on a single clause: 'Including questions, explanations, and\r\ninterlocutory suggestions, Mr. Gladstone made nine-and-twenty speeches,\r\nsome of them of considerable length. Sometimes he was argumentative,\r\nfrequently ingenious and critical, often personal, and not less often\r\nindignant at the alleged personality of others.'\r\n\r\nHe made no pretence of thinking the principle of divorce _a vinculo_\r\nanything but an immense evil, but he still held himself free, if that\r\nview were repudiated, to consider the legislative question of\r\ndissolubility and its conditions. He resorted abundantly to what\r\nPalmerston called 'the old standard set-up form of objecting to any\r\nimprovement, to say that it does not carry out all the improvements of\r\nwhich the matter in hand is susceptible.' One of the complaints of which\r\nhe made most was the inequality in the bill between the respective\r\nrights of husband and wife. 'It is the special and peculiar doctrines of\r\nthe Gospel,' he said, 'respecting the personal relation of every\r\nChristian, whether man or woman, to the person of Christ, that form the\r\nfirm, the broad, the indestructible basis of the equality of the sexes\r\nunder the Christian law.' Again, 'in the vast majority of instances\r\nwhere the woman falls into sin, she does so from motives less impure\r\nand ignoble than those of the man.' He attacks with just vigour the\r\nlimitation of legal cruelty in this case to the cruelty of mere force\r\nimporting danger to life, limb, or health, though he was shocked in\r\nafter years, as well he might be, at the grotesque excess to which the\r\ndoctrine of 'mental cruelty' has been carried in some States of the\r\nAmerican Union. In this branch of the great controversy, at any rate, he\r\nspeaks in a nobler and humaner temper than Milton, who writes with a\r\ntyrannical Jewish belief in the inferiority of women to men, and wives\r\nto husbands, that was in Mr. Gladstone's middle life slowly beginning to\r\nmelt away in English public opinion. His second complaint, and in his\r\neyes much the more urgent of the two, was the right conferred by the\r\ngovernment bill upon divorced persons to claim marriage by a clergyman\r\nin a church, and still more bitterly did he resent the obligation\r\nimposed by the bill upon clergymen to perform such marriages. Here the\r\nfight was not wholly unsuccessful, and modifications were secured as the\r\nfruit of his efforts, narrowing and abating, though not removing, his\r\ngrounds of objection.[368]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                       DEATH OF LADY LYTTELTON\r\n\r\nBefore the battle was over, he was torn away from the scene by a painful\r\nbereavement. Mrs. Gladstone was at Hagley nursing her beloved sister,\r\nLady Lyttelton. He wrote to his wife in the fiercest hours of the fight\r\n(11 Carlton House Terrace, Aug. 15): 'I read too plainly in your letter\r\nof yesterday that your heart is heavy, and mine too is heavy along with\r\nyours. I have been in many minds about my duty to-day; and I am all but\r\nready to break the bands even of the high obligations that have kept me\r\nhere with reference to the marriage bill. You have only to speak the\r\nword by telegraph or otherwise, showing that I can help to give any of\r\nthe support you need, and I come to you. As matters stand I am wanted in\r\nthe House to-day, and am wanted for the Divorce bill again on Monday.'\r\nBefore Monday came, Lady Lyttelton was no more. Four days after her\r\ndeath, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Mr. Arthur Gordon from Hagley:--\r\n\r\n     The loss suffered here is a dreadful one, but it is borne in the\r\n     way which robs death and all evil of its sting. My deceased\r\n     sister-in-law was so united with my wife; they so drew from their\r\n     very earliest years, and not less since marriage than before it,\r\n     their breath so to speak in common, that the relation I bore to her\r\n     conveys little even of what I have lost; but that again is little\r\n     compared to my wife's bereavement; and far above all to that of\r\n     Lyttelton, who now stands lonely among his twelve children. But the\r\n     retrospect from first to last is singularly bright and pure. She\r\n     seemed to be one of those rare spirits who do not need affliction\r\n     to draw them to their Lord, and from first to last there was scarce\r\n     a shade of it in her life. When she was told she was to die, her\r\n     pulse did not change; the last communion appeared wholly to sever\r\n     her from the world, but she smiled upon her husband within a minute\r\n     of the time when the spirit fled.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[357] See above pp. 525-8.\r\n\r\n[358] Phillimore's Diary.\r\n\r\n[359] The reader will find a candid statement of the controversy in\r\nNorthcote, _Financial Policy_, pp. 306-329.\r\n\r\n[360] _Ars Poetica_, 32-5.\r\n\r\n[361] Malmesbury, _Memoirs_, ii. pp. 56-7.

The judicial\r\nstatistics, however, hardly support this view, that petitions for\r\ndivorce were constantly increasing, and at an accelerating rate of\r\nprogression. In England the proportion of divorce petitions to marriages\r\nand the proportion of divorce decrees to population are both of them\r\nlower than they were a few years ago. Mr. Gladstone used to desire the\r\nprohibition of publicity in these proceedings, until he learned the\r\nstrong view of the president of the Court that the hideous glare of this\r\npublicity acts probably as no inconsiderable deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                     THE SECOND DERBY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n                               (_1858_)\r\n\r\n     Extravagance and exaggeration of ideas are not the essential\r\n     characteristic of either political party in this country. Both of\r\n     them are composed in the main of men with English hearts and\r\n     English feelings. Each of them comprises within itself far greater\r\n     diversities of political principles and tendencies, than can be\r\n     noted as dividing the more moderate portion of the one from the\r\n     more moderate portion of the other.... But while the great English\r\n     parties differ no more in their general outlines than by a somewhat\r\n     varied distribution of the same elements in each, they are liable\r\n     to be favourably or unfavourably affected and their essential\r\n     characteristics unduly exaggerated, by circumstances of the order\r\n     that would be termed accidental.--GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turn of the political wheel is constantly producing strange results,\r\nbut none has ever been more strikingly dramatic than when, on February\r\n20, Bright and Milner Gibson, who had been ignominiously thrown out at\r\nManchester the year before, had the satisfaction of walking to the table\r\nof the House of Commons as victorious tellers in the division on the\r\nConspiracy to Murder bill that overthrew Lord Palmerston. A plot to slay\r\nthe French Emperor had been organised by a band of Italian refugees in\r\nLondon. The bombs were manufactured in England. Orsini's design\r\nmiscarried, but feeling in France was greatly excited, and the French\r\ngovernment formally drew attention at St. James's to the fact that\r\nbodies of assassins abused our right of asylum. They hinted further that\r\nthe amity of the crown called for stronger law. Palmerston very sensibly\r\ndid not answer the French despatch, but introduced a bill with new\r\npowers against conspiracy. He in an instant became the most unpopular\r\nman in the country, and the idol of the year before was now hooted in\r\nthe Park.\r\n\r\n                      LORD PALMERSTON DEFEATED\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was at first doubtful, but soon made up his mind. To Mrs.\r\nGladstone he writes (Feb. 17):--\r\n\r\n     As respects the Conspiracy bill, you may depend upon our having\r\n     plenty of fight; the result is doubtful; but if the bill gets into\r\n     the House of Lords it will pass. Lord Aberdeen is strong against\r\n     it. From him I went to-day to Lord Lyndhurst, and I found Lord\r\n     Brougham with him. A most interesting conversation followed with\r\n     these two wonderful old men at 80 and 86 (coming next birthday)\r\n     respectively, both in the fullest possession of their faculties,\r\n     Brougham vehement, impulsive, full of gesticulation, and not a\r\n     little rambling, the other calm and clear as a deep pool upon rock.\r\n     Lord Lyndhurst is decidedly against the bill, Brougham somewhat\r\n     inclines to it; being, as Lord Lyndhurst says, half a Frenchman.\r\n     [Lord Lyndhurst expounded the matter in a most luminous way from\r\n     his point of view. Brougham went into raptures and used these\r\n     words: 'I tell you what, Lyndhurst, I wish I could make an exchange\r\n     with you. I would give you some of my walking power, and you should\r\n     give me some of your brains.' I have often told the story with this\r\n     brief commentary, that the compliment was the highest I have ever\r\n     known to be paid by one human being to another.][369]\r\n\r\nThe debate showed a curious inversion of the parts usually played by\r\neminent men. Palmerston vainly explained that he was doing no more than\r\ninternational comity required, and doing no worse than placing the\r\nforeign refugee on the same footing in respect of certain offences as\r\nthe British subject. Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 19), on the other hand, 'as one\r\nwho has perhaps too often made it his business to call attention to the\r\nfailings of his countrymen,' contended that if national honour was not\r\nhenceforth to be a shadow and a name, it was the paramount, absolute,\r\nand imperative duty of Her Majesty's ministers to protest against the\r\nimputation upon us of favour for assassination, 'a plant which is\r\ncongenial neither to our soil nor to the climate in which we live.'[370]\r\nOne of the truest things said in the debate was Disraeli's incidental\r\nobservation that 'the House should remember that in ninety-nine cases\r\nout of a hundred, when there is a quarrel between two states, it is\r\ngenerally occasioned by some blunder of a ministry.' Mr. Disraeli\r\nperhaps consoled himself by the pithy saying of Baron Brunnow, that if\r\nno one made any blunders, there would be no politics. The blood of the\r\n_civis Romanus_, however, was up, and Palmerston, defeated by a majority\r\nof nineteen, at once resigned.\r\n\r\n                    CORRESPONDENCE WITH LORD DERBY\r\n\r\nLord Derby, whose heart had failed him three years earlier, now formed\r\nhis second administration, and made one more attempt to bring Mr.\r\nGladstone over to the conservative ranks. Lord Lansdowne had told the\r\nQueen that no other government was possible, and an hour after he had\r\nkissed hands the new prime minister applied to Mr. Gladstone. The\r\ndecisions taken by him in answer to this and another application three\r\nmonths later, mark one more of the curious turning points in his career\r\nand in the fate of his party.\r\n\r\n     _Feb. 20, 1858._--Dined at Herbert's with Graham. We sat till 121/2,\r\n     but did not talk quite through the crisis. Palmerston has resigned.\r\n     He is down. I must now cease to denounce him. 21.--St. James's\r\n     morning, and holy communion. Westminster Abbey in evening, when I\r\n     sat by Sir George Grey. From St. James's I went to Lord Aberdeen's.\r\n     There Derby's letter reached me. We sent for Herbert and I wrote an\r\n     answer. Graham arrived and heard it; with slight modifications it\r\n     went. The case though grave was not doubtful. Made two copies and\r\n     went off before 6 with S. Herbert. We separated for the evening\r\n     with the fervent wish that in public life we might never part.\r\n\r\nTwo or three letters exhibit the situation:--\r\n\r\n                     _Lord Derby to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _St. James's Square, Feb. 21, 1858._--In consequence of the adverse\r\n     vote of the other night, in which you took so prominent and\r\n     distinguished a part, the government, as you know, has resigned;\r\n     and I have been entrusted by the Queen with the difficult task,\r\n     which I have felt it my duty not to decline, of forming an\r\n     administration. In doing so, I am very desirous, if possible, of\r\n     obtaining the co-operation of men of eminence, who are not at this\r\n     moment fettered by other ties, and whose principles are not\r\n     incompatible with my own. Believing that you stand in this\r\n     position, it would afford me very great satisfaction if I could\r\n     obtain your valuable aid in forming my proposed cabinet; and if I\r\n     should be so fortunate as to do so, I am sure there would be on all\r\n     hands a sincere desire to consult your wishes, as far as possible,\r\n     as to the distribution of offices. I would willingly include Sidney\r\n     Herbert in this offer; but I fear he is too intimately associated\r\n     with John Russell to make it possible for him to accept.\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n     10 _Great George Street, Feb. 21, 1851._--I am very sensible of the\r\n     importance of the vote taken on Friday; and I should deeply lament\r\n     to see the House of Commons trampled on in consequence of that\r\n     vote. The honour of the House is materially involved in giving it\r\n     full effect. It would therefore be my first wish to aid, if\r\n     possible, in such a task; and remembering the years when we were\r\n     colleagues, I may be permitted to say that there is nothing in the\r\n     fact of your being the head of a ministry, which would avail to\r\n     deter me from forming part of it.\r\n\r\n     Among the first questions I have had to put to myself, in\r\n     consequence of the offer which you have conveyed in such friendly\r\n     and flattering terms, has been the question whether it would be in\r\n     my power by accepting it, either alone or in concert with others,\r\n     to render you material service. After the long years during which\r\n     we have been separated, there would be various matters of public\r\n     interest requiring to be noticed between us; but the question I\r\n     have mentioned is a needful preliminary. Upon the best\r\n     consideration which the moment allows, I think it plain that alone,\r\n     as I must be, I could not render you service worth your having. The\r\n     dissolution of last year excluded from parliament men with whom I\r\n     had sympathies; and it in some degree affected the position of\r\n     those political friends with whom I have now for many years been\r\n     united through evil and (much more rarely) through good report.\r\n     Those who lament the rupture of old traditions may well desire the\r\n     reconstitution of a party; but the reconstitution of a party can\r\n     only be effected, if at all, by the return of the old influences to\r\n     their places, and not by the junction of an isolated person. The\r\n     difficulty is even enhanced in my case by the fact that in your\r\n     party, reduced as it is at the present moment in numbers, there is\r\n     a small but active and not unimportant section who avowedly regard\r\n     me as the representative of the most dangerous ideas. I should\r\n     thus, unfortunately, be to you a source of weakness in the heart of\r\n     your own adherents, while I should bring you no party or group of\r\n     friends to make up for their defection or discontent.\r\n\r\n     For the reasons which I have thus stated or glanced at, my reply to\r\n     your letter must be in the negative.\r\n\r\n     I must, however, add that a government formed by you at this time\r\n     will, in my opinion, have strong claims upon me, and upon any one\r\n     situated as I am, for favourable presumptions, and in the absence\r\n     of conscientious difference on important questions, for support. I\r\n     have had an opportunity of seeing Lord Aberdeen and Sidney Herbert;\r\n     and they fully concur in the sentiments I have just expressed.\r\n\r\n                         LETTER FROM MR. BRIGHT\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had no close personal or political ties with the\r\nManchester men at this moment, but we may well believe that a sagacious\r\nletter from Mr. Bright made its mark upon his meditations:--\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Bright to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n     _Reform Club, Feb. 21, '58._--Coming down Park Lane just now, I met\r\n     a leading lawyer of Lord Derby's party, who will doubtless be in\r\n     office with him if he succeeds in forming a government. He told me\r\n     that Lord Derby and his friends were expecting to be able to induce\r\n     you to join them.\r\n\r\n     Will you forgive me if I write to you on this matter? I say nothing\r\n     but in the most friendly spirit, and I have some confidence that\r\n     you will not misinterpret what I am doing. Lord Derby has only\r\n     about one-third of the House of Commons with him--and it is\r\n     impossible by any management, or by any dissolution, to convert\r\n     this minority into a majority. His minority in the House is greater\r\n     and more powerful than it is in the country--and any appeal to the\r\n     country, now or hereafter, must, I think, leave him in no better\r\n     position than that in which he now finds himself. The whole liberal\r\n     party in the country dislike him, and they dislike his former\r\n     leader in the Commons; and notoriously his own party in the\r\n     country, and in the House, have not much confidence in him. There\r\n     is no party in the country to rally round him, as Peel was\r\n     supported in 1841. A Derby government can only exist upon\r\n     forbearance, and will only last till it is convenient for us and\r\n     the whigs to overthrow it. Lord Palmerston may give it his support\r\n     for a time, but he can give it little more than his own vote and\r\n     speeches, for the liberal constituencies will not forgive their\r\n     members if they support it. If you join Lord Derby, you link your\r\n     fortunes with a constant minority, and with a party in the country\r\n     which is every day lessening in numbers and in power. If you remain\r\n     on our side of the House, you are with the majority, and no\r\n     government can be formed without you. You have many friends there,\r\n     and some who would grieve much to see you leave them--and I know\r\n     nothing that can prevent your being prime minister before you\r\n     approach the age of every other member of the House who has or can\r\n     have any claim to that high office.\r\n\r\n     If you agree rather with the men opposite than with those among\r\n     whom you have been sitting of late, I have nothing to say. I am\r\n     sure you will follow where 'the right' leads, if you only discover\r\n     it, and I am not hoping or wishing to keep you from the right. I\r\n     think I am not mistaken in the opinion I have formed of the\r\n     direction in which your views have for some years been tending. You\r\n     know well enough the direction in which the opinions of the country\r\n     are tending. The minority which invites you to join it, if honest,\r\n     must go or wish to go, in an opposite direction, and it cannot\r\n     therefore govern the country. Will you unite yourself with what\r\n     must be, from the beginning, an inevitable failure?\r\n\r\n     Don't be offended, if, by writing this, I seem to believe you will\r\n     join Lord Derby. I don't believe it--but I can imagine your seeing\r\n     the matter from a point of view very different to mine--and I feel\r\n     a strong wish just to say to you what is passing in my mind. You\r\n     will not be the less able to decide on your proper course. If I\r\n     thought this letter would annoy you, I would not send it. I think\r\n     you will take it in the spirit in which it is written. No one knows\r\n     that I am writing it, and I write it from no idea of personal\r\n     advantage to myself, but with a view to yours, and to the interests\r\n     of the country. I may be mistaken, but think I am not. Don't think\r\n     it necessary to reply to this. I only ask you to read it, and to\r\n     forgive me the intrusion upon you--and further to believe that I am\r\n     yours, with much respect.\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Bright._\r\n\r\n     _10 Great George Street, Feb. 22, '58._--Your letter can only bear\r\n     one construction, that of an act of peculiar kindness which ought\r\n     not to be readily forgotten. For any one in whom I might be\r\n     interested I should earnestly desire, upon his entering public\r\n     life, that, if possible, he might with a good conscience end in the\r\n     party where he began, or else that he might have broad and definite\r\n     grounds for quitting it. When neither of these advantages appears\r\n     to be certainly within command, there remains a strong and\r\n     paramount consolation in seeking, as we best can, the truth and the\r\n     public interests; and I think it a marked instance of liberality,\r\n     that you should give me credit for keeping this object in my view.\r\n\r\n     My seeking, however, has not on the present occasion been very\r\n     difficult. The opinions, such as they are, that I hold on many\r\n     questions of government and administration are strongly held; and\r\n     although I set a value, and a high value, upon the power which\r\n     office gives, I earnestly hope never to be tempted by its exterior\r\n     allurements, unless they are accompanied with the reasonable\r\n     prospect of giving effect to some at least of those opinions and\r\n     with some adequate opening for public good. On the present\r\n     occasion I have not seen such a prospect; and before I received\r\n     your letter yesterday afternoon I had made my choice.\r\n\r\nThis ended the first scene of the short fifth act. The new government\r\nwas wholly conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                          UNEASINESS OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of this period, Mr. Gladstone's political friends\r\nwere uneasy about him. 'He writes and says and does too much,' Graham\r\nhad told Lord Aberdeen (Dec. 1856), and a year and a half later the same\r\ncorrespondent notices a restless anxiety for a change of position,\r\nthough at Gladstone's age and with his abilities he could not wonder at\r\nit. Mr. Gladstone was now approaching fifty; Graham was nearer seventy\r\nthan sixty; and Aberdeen drawing on to seventy-five. One of the most\r\neminent of his friends confessed that he was 'amazed at a man of\r\nGladstone's high moral sense of feeling being able to _bear_ with Dizzy.\r\nI can only account for it on the supposition, which I suppose to be the\r\ntrue one, that personal dislike and distrust of Palmerston is the one\r\nabsorbing feeling with him.... I see no good ground for the violent\r\npersonal prejudice which is the sole ruling motive of Gladstone's and\r\nGraham's course--especially when the alternative is such a man as\r\nDizzy.' Then comes some angry language about that enigmatic personage\r\nwhich at this cooling distance of time need not here be transcribed. At\r\nthe end of 1856 Lord Aberdeen told Mr. Gladstone that his position in\r\nthe House was 'very peculiar.' 'With an admitted superiority of\r\ncharacter and intellectual power above any other member, I fear that you\r\ndo not really possess the sympathy of the House at large, while you have\r\nincurred the strong dislike of a considerable portion of Lord Derby's\r\nfollowers.'\r\n\r\nThings grew worse rather than better. Even friendly journalists in the\r\nspring of 1858 wrote of him as 'the most signal example that the present\r\ntime affords of the man of speculation misplaced and lost in the\r\nlabyrinth of practical politics.' They call him the chief orator and the\r\nweakest man in the House of Commons. He has exhibited at every stage\r\ntraces of an unhappy incoherence which is making him a mere bedouin of\r\nparliament, a noble being full of spirit and power, but not to be tamed\r\ninto the ordinary ways of civil life. His sympathies hover in hopeless\r\ninconsistency between love for righteous national action, good\r\ngovernment, freedom, social and commercial reform, and a hankering after\r\na strong, unassailable executive in the old obstructive tory sense. He\r\nprotests against unfair dealing with the popular voice in the\r\nPrincipalities on the Danube, but when the popular voice on the Thames\r\ndemands higher honours for General Havelock he resists it with the\r\ndoctrine that the executive should be wholly free to distribute honours\r\nas it pleases. He is loudly indignant against the supersession of\r\nparliament by diplomacy, but when a motion is made directly pointing to\r\nthe rightful influence of the House over foreign affairs, he neither\r\nspeaks nor votes. Is it not clear beyond dispute that his cannot be the\r\nwill to direct, nor the wisdom to guide the party of progress out of\r\nwhich the materials for the government of this country will have to be\r\nchosen?[371]\r\n\r\nIn organs supposed to be inspired by Disraeli, Mr. Gladstone's fate is\r\npronounced in different terms, but with equal decision. In phrases that\r\nmust surely have fallen from the very lips of the oracle itself, the\r\npublic was told that 'cerebral natures, men of mere intellect without\r\nmoral passion, are quite unsuited for governing mankind.' The days of\r\nthe mere dialectician are over, and the rulers of Christendom are no\r\nlonger selected from the serfs of Aristotle. Without the emotions that\r\nsoar and thrill and enkindle, no man can attain 'a grand moral vision.'\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone aims at philosophy, he only reaches casuistry. He\r\nreasons like one of the sons of Ignatius Loyola. What their Society is\r\nto the Jesuit, his own individualism is to Mr. Gladstone. He supports\r\nhis own interests as much from intellectual zeal as from self-love. A\r\nshrewd observer is quoted: 'looking on Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Sidney\r\nHerbert sitting side by side, the former with his rather saturnine face\r\nand straight black hair, and the latter eminently handsome, with his\r\nbright, cold smile and subtlety of aspect, I have often thought that I\r\nwas beholding the Jesuit of the closet really devout, and the Jesuit of\r\nthe world, ambitious, artful, and always on the watch for making his\r\nrapier thrusts.' Mr. Gladstone, in a word, is extremely eminent, but\r\nstrangely eccentric, 'a Simeon Stylites among the statesmen of his\r\ntime.'[372]\r\n\r\n                    RENEWED PROPOSAL OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nIn May an important vacancy occurred in the ministerial ranks by Lord\r\nEllenborough's resignation of the presidency of the board of control.\r\nThis became the occasion of a renewed proposal to Mr. Gladstone. He\r\ntells the story in a memorandum prepared (May 22) for submission to\r\nAberdeen and Graham, whom Lord Derby urged him to consult.\r\n\r\n     _Memorandum by Mr. Gladstone submitted to Lord Aberdeen and Sir\r\n     James Graham. May 22, '58._\r\n\r\n     _Secret._--Last week after Mr. Cardwell's notice but before the\r\n     debate began, Mr. Walpole, after previously sounding Sir William\r\n     Heathcote to a similar effect, called me aside in the lobby of the\r\n     House of Commons and inquired whether I could be induced to take\r\n     office. I replied that I thought that question put by him of his\r\n     own motion--as he had described it--was one that I could hardly\r\n     answer. It seemed plain, I said, that the actual situation was one\r\n     so entirely belonging to the government as it stood, that they must\r\n     plainly work through it unchanged; that the head of the government\r\n     was the only person who could make a proposal or put a question\r\n     about taking office in it; I added, however, that my general views\r\n     were the same as in February.\r\n\r\n     This morning I had a note from Walpole asking for an appointment;\r\n     and he called on me at four o'clock accordingly. He stated that he\r\n     came by authority of Lord Derby to offer me the board of control\r\n     or, if I preferred it, the colonial office. That he had told Lord\r\n     Derby I should, he thought, be likely to raise difficulties on two\r\n     points: first, the separation from those who have been my friends\r\n     in public life; secondly, the leadership of the House of Commons. I\r\n     here interrupted him to say it must be in his option to speak or to\r\n     be silent on the latter of these subjects; it was one which had\r\n     never been entertained or opened by me in connection with this\r\n     subject, since the former of the two points had offered an absolute\r\n     preliminary bar to the acceptance of office. He, however, explained\r\n     himself as follows, that Mr. Disraeli had stated his willingness to\r\n     surrender the leadership to Sir James Graham, if he were disposed\r\n     to join the government; but that the expressions he had used in his\r\n     speech of Thursday[373] (apparently those with respect to parties\r\n     in the House and to office), seemed to put it beyond the right of\r\n     the government to make any proposal to him. He at the same time\r\n     spoke in the highest terms not only of the speech, but of the\r\n     position in which he thought it placed Sir James Graham; and he\r\n     left me to infer that there would have been, but for the cause\r\n     named, a desire to obtain his co-operation as leader of the House\r\n     of Commons. With respect to the proposal as one the acceptance of\r\n     which would separate me from my friends, he hoped it was not so. It\r\n     was one made to me alone, the immediate vacancy being a single one;\r\n     but the spirit in which it was made was a desire that it should be\r\n     taken to signify the wish of the government progressively to extend\r\n     its basis, as far as it could be effected compatibly with\r\n     consistency in its opinions. He added that judging from the past he\r\n     hoped he might assume that there was no active opposition to the\r\n     government on the part of my friends, naming Lord Aberdeen, Sir\r\n     James Graham, and the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n     I told him with respect to the leadership that I thought it\r\n     handsome on the part of Mr. Disraeli to offer to waive it on behalf\r\n     of Sir James Graham; that it was a subject which did not enter into\r\n     my decision for the reason I had stated; and I hinted also that it\r\n     was one on which I could never negotiate or make stipulations. It\r\n     was true, I said, I had no broad differences of principle from the\r\n     party opposite; on the whole perhaps I differed more from Lord\r\n     Palmerston than from almost any one, and this was more on account\r\n     of his temper and views of public conduct, than of any political\r\n     opinions. Nay more, it would be hard to show broad differences of\r\n     public principle between the government and the bench opposite.\r\n\r\n                        RENEWED PROPOSAL OF OFFICE\r\n\r\n     I said, however, that in my view the proposal which he had made to\r\n     me could not be entertained. I felt the personal misfortune and\r\n     public inconvenience of being thrown out of party connection; but a\r\n     man at the bottom of the well must not try to get out, however\r\n     disagreeable his position, until a rope or a ladder is put down to\r\n     him. In this case my clear opinion was that by joining the\r\n     government I should shock the public sentiment and should make no\r\n     essential, no important, change in their position.\r\n\r\n     I expressed much regret that accidental causes had kept back from\r\n     my view at the critical moment the real extent of Lord Derby's\r\n     proposals in February; that I answered him then as an individual\r\n     with respect to myself individually.... I could not separate from\r\n     those with whom I had been acting all my life long, in concert with\r\n     whom all the habits of my mind and my views of public affairs had\r\n     been formed, to go into what might justly be called a cabinet of\r\n     strangers, since it contained no man to whom I had ever been a\r\n     colleague, with the single exception of Lord Derby, and that twelve\r\n     or fourteen years ago.\r\n\r\n     While I did not conceive that public feeling would or ought to\r\n     approve this separation, on the other hand I felt that my\r\n     individual junction would and could draw no material accession of\r\n     strength to the cabinet. He made the marked admission that if my\r\n     acceptance must be without the _approval_ of friends, that must\r\n     undoubtedly be an element of great weight in the case. This showed\r\n     clearly that Lord Derby was looking to me in the first place, and\r\n     then to others beyond me. He did not, however, found upon this any\r\n     request, and he took my answer as an absolute refusal. His tone\r\n     was, I need not say, very cordial; and I think I have stated all\r\n     that was material in the conversation, except that he signified\r\n     they were under the belief that Herbert entertained strong personal\r\n     feelings towards Disraeli.\r\n\r\n     Returning home, however, at seven this evening I found a note from\r\n     Walpole expressing Lord Derby's wish in the following words: 'That\r\n     before you finally decide on refusing to accept the offer he has\r\n     made either of the colonies or of the India board he wishes you\r\n     would consult Sir James Graham and Lord Aberdeen.' In order to meet\r\n     this wish, I have put down the foregoing statement.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen agreed with Mr. Gladstone that on the whole the balance\r\ninclined to _no_.\r\n\r\nGraham, in an admirable letter, truly worthy of a wise, affectionate,\r\nand faithful friend, said, 'My judgment is, on this occasion, balanced\r\nlike your own.' He ran through the catalogue of Mr. Gladstone's most\r\nintimate political friends; the result was that he stood alone. Fixed\r\nparty ties and active official duties would conduce to his present\r\nhappiness and his future fame. He might form an intimate alliance with\r\nLord Derby with perfect honour. His natural affinities were strong, and\r\nhis 'honest liberal tendencies' would soon leaven the whole lump and\r\nbring it into conformity with the shape and body of the times. As for\r\nthe leadership in the Commons, Graham had once thought that for\r\nGladstone to sit on the treasury bench with Disraeli for his leader\r\nwould be humiliation and dishonour. Later events had qualified this\r\nopinion. Of course, the abdication of Disraeli could not be made a\r\ncondition precedent, but the concession would somehow be made, and in\r\nthe Commons pre-eminence would be Gladstone's, be the conditions what\r\nthey might. In fine, time was wearing fast away, Gladstone had reached\r\nthe utmost vigour of his powers, and present opportunities were not to\r\nbe neglected in vain expectation of better.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                        LETTER FROM MR. DISRAELI\r\n\r\nBefore this letter of Graham's arrived, an unexpected thing happened,\r\nand Mr. Disraeli himself advanced to the front of the stage. His\r\ncommunication, which opens and closes without the usual epistolary\r\nforms, just as it is reproduced here, marks a curious episode, and sheds\r\na strange light on that perplexing figure:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Mr. Disraeli to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n_Confidential._\r\n\r\n     I think it of such paramount importance to the public interests,\r\n     that you should assume at this time a commanding position in the\r\n     administration of affairs, that I feel it a solemn duty to lay\r\n     before you some facts, that you may not decide under a\r\n     misapprehension.\r\n\r\n     Our mutual relations have formed the great difficulty in\r\n     accomplishing a result, which I have always anxiously desired.\r\n\r\n     Listen, without prejudice, to this brief narrative.\r\n\r\n     In 1850, when the balanced state of parties in the House of Commons\r\n     indicated the future, I endeavoured, through the medium of the late\r\n     Lord Londonderry, and for some time not without hope, to induce Sir\r\n     James Graham to accept the post of leader of the conservative\r\n     party, which I thought would remove all difficulties.\r\n\r\n     When he finally declined this office, I endeavoured to throw the\r\n     game into your hands, and your conduct then, however unintentional,\r\n     assisted me in my views.\r\n\r\n     The precipitate ministry of 1852 baffled all this. Could we have\r\n     postponed it another year, all might have been right.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, notwithstanding my having been forced publicly into\r\n     the chief place in the Commons, and all that occurred in\r\n     consequence, I was still constant to my purpose, and in 1855\r\n     suggested that the leadership of the House should be offered to\r\n     Lord Palmerston, entirely with the view of consulting your feelings\r\n     and facilitating your position.\r\n\r\n     Some short time back, when the power of dissolution was certain,\r\n     and the consequences of it such as, in my opinion, would be highly\r\n     favourable to the conservative party, I again confidentially sought\r\n     Sir James Graham, and implored him to avail himself of the\r\n     favourable conjuncture, accept the post of leader in the H. of C,\r\n     and allow both of us to serve under him.\r\n\r\n     He was more than kind to me, and fully entered into the state of\r\n     affairs, but he told me his course was run, and that he had not\r\n     strength or spirit for such an enterprise.\r\n\r\n     Thus you see, for more than eight years, instead of thrusting\r\n     myself into the foremost place, I have been, at all times, actively\r\n     prepared to make every sacrifice of self for the public good,\r\n     which I have ever thought identical with your accepting office in\r\n     a conservative government.\r\n\r\n     Don't you think the time has come when you might deign to be\r\n     magnanimous?\r\n\r\n     Mr. Canning was superior to Lord Castlereagh in capacity, in\r\n     acquirements, in eloquence, but he joined Lord C. when Lord C. was\r\n     Lord Liverpool's lieutenant, when the state of the tory party\r\n     rendered it necessary. That was an enduring, and, on the whole, not\r\n     an unsatisfactory connection, and it certainly terminated very\r\n     gloriously for Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\n     I may be removed from the scene, or I may wish to be removed from\r\n     the scene.\r\n\r\n     Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than\r\n     ourselves, that disposes of all this.\r\n\r\n     The conjuncture is very critical, and if prudently yet boldly\r\n     managed, may rally this country. To be inactive now is, on your\r\n     part, a great responsibility. If you join Lord Derby's cabinet, you\r\n     will meet there some warm personal friends; all its members are\r\n     your admirers. You may place me in neither category, but in that, I\r\n     assure you, you have ever been sadly mistaken. The vacant post is,\r\n     at this season, the most commanding in the commonwealth; if it were\r\n     not, whatever office you filled, your shining qualities would\r\n     always render you supreme; and if party necessities retain me\r\n     formally in the chief post, the sincere and delicate respect which\r\n     I should always offer you, and the unbounded confidence, which on\r\n     my part, if you choose you could command, would prevent your\r\n     feeling my position as anything but a form.\r\n\r\n     Think of all this in a kindly spirit. These are hurried lines, but\r\n     they are heartfelt. I was in the country yesterday, and must return\r\n     there to-day for a county dinner. My direction is Langley Park,\r\n     Slough. But on Wednesday evening I shall be in town.--B. DISRAELI.\r\n     _Grosvenor Gate_, _May_ 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nNone of us, I believe, were ever able to persuade Mr. Gladstone to do\r\njustice to Disraeli's novels,--the spirit of whim in them, the ironic\r\nsolemnity, the historical paradoxes, the fantastic glitter of dubious\r\ngems, the grace of high comedy, all in union with a social vision that\r\noften pierced deep below the surface. In the comparative stiffness of\r\nMr. Gladstone's reply on this occasion, I seem to hear the same accents\r\nof guarded reprobation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Disraeli._\r\n\r\n     11 _Carlton House Terrace_, _May_ 25, '58.--MY DEAR SIR,--The\r\n     letter you have been so kind as to address to me will enable me, I\r\n     trust, to remove from your mind some impressions with which you\r\n     will not be sorry to part.\r\n\r\n     You have given me a narrative of your conduct since 1850 with\r\n     reference to your position as leader of your party. But I have\r\n     never thought your retention of that office matter of reproach to\r\n     you, and on Saturday last I acknowledged to Mr. Walpole the\r\n     handsomeness of your conduct in offering to resign it to Sir James\r\n     Graham.\r\n\r\n     You consider that the relations between yourself and me have proved\r\n     the main difficulty in the way of certain political arrangements.\r\n     Will you allow me to assure you that I have never in my life taken\r\n     a decision which turned upon those relations.\r\n\r\n     You assure me that I have ever been mistaken in failing to place\r\n     you among my friends or admirers. Again I pray you to let me say\r\n     that I have never known you penurious in admiration towards any one\r\n     who had the slightest claim to it, and that at no period of my\r\n     life, not even during the limited one when we were in sharp\r\n     political conflict, have I either felt any enmity towards you, or\r\n     believed that you felt any towards me.\r\n\r\n     At the present moment I am awaiting counsel which at Lord Derby's\r\n     wish I have sought. But the difficulties which he wishes me to find\r\n     means of overcoming, are broader than you may have supposed. Were I\r\n     at this time to join any government I could not do it in virtue of\r\n     party connections. I must consider then what are the conditions\r\n     which make harmonious and effective co-operation in cabinet\r\n     possible--how largely old habits enter into them--what connections\r\n     can be formed with public approval--and what change would be\r\n     requisite in the constitution of the present government, in order\r\n     to make any change worth a trial.\r\n\r\n     I state these points fearlessly and without reserve, for you have\r\n     yourself well reminded me that there is a Power beyond us that\r\n     disposes of what we are and do, and I find the limits of choice in\r\n     public life to be very narrow.--I remain, etc.\r\n\r\n                       THE SECOND DERBY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Gladstone received Graham's letter already described.\r\nThe interpretation that he put upon it was that although Graham appeared\r\nto lean in favour of acceptance, 'yet the counsel was indecisive.' On\r\nordinary construction, though the counsellor said that this was a case\r\nin which only the man himself could decide, yet he also said that\r\nacceptance would be for the public good. 'Your affirmative advice, had\r\nit even been more positive, was not approval, nor was Lord Aberdeen's.\r\nOn the contrary it would have been like the orders to Balaam, that he\r\nshould go with the messengers of Balak, when notwithstanding the\r\ncommand, the act was recorded against him.' We may be quite sure that\r\nwhen a man draws all these distinctions, between affirmative advice,\r\npositive advice, approval, he is going to act without any advice at all,\r\nas Mr. Gladstone was in so grave a case bound to do. He declined to\r\njoin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n     _Private._\r\n\r\n\r\n     _11 C.H. Terrace, May 26, '58._--I have this morning received\r\n     Sir James Graham's reply, and I have seen Lord Aberdeen before and\r\n     since. Their counsel has been given in no narrow or unfriendly\r\n     spirit. It is, however, indecisive, and leaves upon me the\r\n     responsibility which they would have been glad if it had been in\r\n     their power to remove. I must therefore adhere to the reply which I\r\n     gave to Mr. Walpole on Saturday; for I have not seen, and I do not\r\n     see, a prospect of public advantage or of material accession to\r\n     your strength, from my entering your government single-handed.\r\n\r\n     Had it been in your power to raise fully the question whether those\r\n     who were formerly your colleagues, could again be brought into\r\n     political relation with you, I should individually have thought it\r\n     to be for the public good that, under the present circumstances of\r\n     the country, such a scheme should be considered deliberately and in\r\n     a favourable spirit. But I neither know that this is in your power,\r\n     nor can I feel very sanguine hopes that the obstacles in the way of\r\n     this proposal on the part of those whom it would embrace, could be\r\n     surmounted. Lord Aberdeen is the person who could best give a\r\n     dispassionate and weighty opinion on that subject. For me the\r\n     question, confined as it is to myself, is a narrow one, and I am\r\n     bound to say that I arrive without doubt at the result.\r\n\r\n                                  REFUSAL\r\n\r\n'I hope and trust,' said Graham, when he knew what Mr. Gladstone had\r\ndone, 'that you have decided rightly; my judgment inclined the other\r\nway. I should be sorry if your letter to Lord Derby led him to make any\r\nmore extended proposal. It could not possibly succeed, as matters now\r\nstand; and the abortive attempt would be injurious to him. The\r\nreconstruction of the fossil remains of the old Peel party is a hopeless\r\ntask. No human power can now reanimate it with the breath of life; it is\r\ndecomposed into atoms and will be remembered only as a happy accident,\r\nwhile it lasted.'[374]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\n                                SUEZ CANAL\r\n\r\nIn one remarkable debate of this summer the solitary statesman descended\r\nfrom his pillar. Now was the time of the memorable scheme for the\r\nconstruction of the Suez Canal, that first emanated from the French\r\ngroup of Saint Simonian visionaries in the earlier half of the century.\r\nTheir dream had taken shape in the fertile and persevering genius of\r\nLesseps, and was at this time the battle-ground of engineers, statesmen,\r\nand diplomatists in every country in Europe. For fifteen years the\r\nBritish government had used all their influence at Constantinople to\r\nprevent the Sultan from sanctioning the project. In June a motion of\r\nprotest was made in the House of Commons. Lord Palmerston persisted that\r\nthe scheme was the greatest bubble that ever was imposed upon the\r\ncredulity and simplicity of the people of this country; the public\r\nmeetings on its behalf were got up by a pack of foreign projectors;\r\ntraffic by the railway would always beat traffic by steamer through the\r\ncanal; it would be a step towards the dismemberment of the Turkish\r\nempire; it would tend to dismember our own empire by opening a passage\r\nbetween the Mediterranean and the Indian ocean, which would be at the\r\ncommand of other nations and not at ours. Away, then, with such a\r\nsacrifice of the interest of Great Britain to philanthropic schemes and\r\nphilosophic reveries! So much for the sound practical man. Mr. Gladstone\r\nfollowed. Don't let us, he said, have governments and ex-governments\r\ncoming down to instruct us here on bubble schemes. As a commercial\r\nproject, let the Suez Canal stand or fall upon commercial grounds. With\r\nclose reasoning, he argued against the proposition that the canal would\r\ntend to sever Turkey from Egypt. As to possible danger to our own\r\ninterests, was it not a canal that would fall within the control of the\r\nstrongest maritime power in Europe? And what could that power be but\r\nourselves? Finally, what could be more unwise than to present ourselves\r\nto the world as the opponents of a scheme on the face of it beneficial\r\nto mankind, on no better ground than remote and contingent danger to\r\ninterests of our own, with the alleged interest of Turkey merely thrust\r\nhypocritically in for the purpose of justifying a policy purely\r\nnarrow-minded and wholly selfish? The majority against the motion was\r\nlarge, as it was in the case of the seven cardinals against Galileo.\r\nStill the canal was made, with some very considerable consequences that\r\nwere not foreseen either by those who favoured it or those who mocked it\r\nas a bubble. M. de Lesseps wrote to Mr. Gladstone from Constantinople\r\nthat the clearness of his speech had enabled him to use it with good\r\neffect in his negotiations with the Porte. 'Your eloquent words, the\r\nauthority of your name, and the consideration that attaches to your\r\ncharacter, have already contributed much and will contribute more still\r\nto hinder the darkening and complication of a question of itself\r\nperfectly clear and simple, and to avoid the troubling of the relations\r\nbetween two countries of which it is the natural mission to hold aloft\r\n_together_ the flag of modern civilisation.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone took an active interest in the various measures--some of\r\nthem extremely singular--proposed by Mr. Disraeli for the transfer of\r\nthe government of India from the Company to the crown. Writing early in\r\nthe year to Sir James Graham he argued that their object should be\r\nsteadily and vigorously to resist all attempts at creating a monster\r\nmilitary and civil patronage, and to insist upon a real check on the\r\nIndian minister. He had much conversation with Mr. Bright--not then an\r\nintimate acquaintance--on the difficulty of the problem to govern a\r\npeople by a people. The two agreed strongly as to one prominent\r\npossibility of mischief: they both distrusted the discretion confided to\r\nthe Indian minister in the use of the Indian army. Mr. Gladstone set a\r\nmark upon the bill by carrying a clause to provide that the Indian army\r\nshould not be employed beyond the frontiers of India without the\r\npermission of parliament. This clause he privately hoped would 'afford a\r\nstanding-ground from which a control might be exercised on future\r\nPalmerstons.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[369] The portion within brackets is from a letter of Mr. Gladstone's to\r\nLady Lyndhurst, Aug. 31, 1883, and he continues: 'I have often compared\r\nLord Lyndhurst in my own mind with the five other lord chancellors who\r\nsince his time have been my colleagues in cabinet: much to the\r\ndisadvantage in certain respects of some of them. Once I remember in the\r\nPeel cabinet the conversation happened to touch some man (there are\r\nsuch) who was too fond of making difficulties. Peel said to your\r\nhusband, \"That is not your way, Lyndhurst.\" Of all the intellects I have\r\never known, his, I think, worked with the least friction.'\r\n\r\n[370] 'Happily for the reputation of the House, but unhappily for the\r\nministry, the debate assumed once more, with Gladstone's eloquence, a\r\nstatesmanlike character. The foremost speaker of the House showed\r\nhimself worthy of his reputation ... much as there was to lament in the\r\ntoo radical tone of his often finespun argumentation. His thundering\r\nperiods were received with thundering echoes of applause.'--Vitzthum,\r\n_St. Petersburg and London_, i. p. 273.\r\n\r\n[371] See _Spectator_, May 8, 1858.\r\n\r\n[372] _Press_, April 7, 1858.\r\n\r\n[373] I wish to state that it is by the courtesy of hon. gentlemen that\r\nI occupy a seat on this (the ministerial) side of the House, although I\r\nam no adherent of Her Majesty's government. By no engagement, express or\r\nimplied, am I their supporter. On the contrary, my sympathies and\r\nopinions are with the liberal party sitting on the opposite side of the\r\nHouse, and from recent kind communications I have resumed those habits\r\nof friendly intercourse and confidential communication with my noble\r\nfriend (Lord John Russell) which formerly existed between us.--_May_ 20,\r\n1858.\r\n\r\n[374] 'I wish,' said Mr. Disraeli to Bishop Wilberforce in 1862, 'you\r\ncould have induced Gladstone to join Lord Derby's government when Lord\r\nEllenborough resigned in 1858. It was not my fault that he did not: I\r\nalmost went on my knees to him.'--_Life_, iii. p. 70.\r\n\r\nVitzthum reports a conversation with Mr. Disraeli in January 1858, of a\r\ndifferent tenor: 'We are at all times ready,' he said, 'to take back\r\nthis deserter, but only if he surrenders unconditionally.'--Vitzthum, i.\r\np. 269.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                          THE IONIAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n                            (_1858-1859_)\r\n\r\n     The world is now taking an immense interest in Greek affairs, and\r\n     does not seem to know why. But there are very good reasons for it.\r\n     Greece is a centre of life, and the only possible centre for the\r\n     Archipelago, and its immediate neighbourhood. But it is vain to\r\n     think of it as a centre from which light and warmth can proceed,\r\n     until it has attained to a tolerable organisation, political and\r\n     economical.

This, said Bulwer Lytton, would be to\r\nrender to the crown a service that no other could do so well, and that\r\nmight not inharmoniously blend with his general fame as scholar and\r\nstatesman. 'To reconcile a race that speaks the Greek language to the\r\nscience of practical liberty seemed to me a task that might be a noble\r\nepisode in your career.' The origin of an invitation so singular is\r\nexplained by Phillimore:--\r\n\r\n     _November_ 2nd, 1858.--Lord Carnarvon (then under-secretary at the\r\n     colonial office) sent an earnest letter to me to come to the C.O.\r\n     and advise with Rogers and himself as to drawing the commission. I\r\n     met Bulwer Lytton there, overflowing with civility. The offer to\r\n     Gladstone had arisen as I expected from Lord C., and he had told B.\r\n     L. the conversation which he (C.) and I had together in the summer,\r\n     in which I told Lord C. that I thought Gladstone would accept a\r\n     mission extraordinary to Naples.... I risked without authority\r\n     from G. this communication. Lord C. bore it in mind, and from this\r\n     suggestion of mine sprang in fact this offer. So Lord C. said to\r\n     me.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury very sensibly observed that to send Mr. Gladstone to\r\nNaples was out of the question, in view of his famous letters to Lord\r\nAberdeen. To the new proposal Mr. Gladstone replied that his first\r\nimpulse on any call from a minister of the crown to see him on public\r\nbusiness, would be to place himself at the minister's disposal. The\r\ninterview did not occur for a week or two. Papers were sent from the\r\ncolonial office to Hawarden, long letters followed from the secretary of\r\nstate, and Mr. Gladstone took time to consider. The constitution of the\r\nIonian islands had long been working uneasily, and what the colonial\r\nsecretary invited him to undertake was an inquiry on the spot into our\r\nrelations there, and into long-standing embarrassments that seemed to be\r\nrapidly coming to a head. Sir John Young, then lord high commissioner of\r\nthe Ionian islands, had been with him at Eton and at Oxford, besides\r\nbeing a Peelite colleague in parliament, and Mr. Gladstone was not\r\ninclined to be the instrument of indicating disparagement of his friend.\r\nThen, moreover, he was in favour of 'a very liberal policy' in regard to\r\nthe Ionian islands, and possibly the cabinet did not agree to a very\r\nliberal policy. As for personal interest and convenience, he was not\r\ndisposed to raise any difficulty in such a case.\r\n\r\nThe Peelite colleagues whose advice he sought were all, with the single\r\nexception of the Duke of Newcastle, more or less unconditionally\r\nadverse. Lord Aberdeen (October 8) admitted that Mr. Gladstone's name,\r\nacquirements, and conciliatory character might operate powerfully on the\r\nIonians; still many of them were false and artful, and the best of them\r\nlittle better than children. 'It is clear,' he said, 'that Bulwer has\r\nsought to allure you with vague declarations and the attractions of\r\nHomeric propensities.... I doubt if Homer will be a _cheval de bataille_\r\nsufficiently strong to carry you safely through the intricacies of this\r\nenterprise.' The sagacious Graham also warned him that little credit\r\nwould be gained by success, while failure would be attended by serious\r\ninconveniences: in any case to quell 'a storm in a teapot' was no\r\noccupation worthy of his powers and position. Sidney Herbert was strong\r\nthat governments were getting more and more into the bad habit of\r\ndelegating their own business to other people; he doubted success, and\r\nexpressed his hearty wish that we could be quit of the protectorate\r\naltogether, and could hand the islands bodily over to Greece, to which\r\nby blood, language, religion, and geography they belonged.\r\n\r\nI have said that these adverse views were almost unqualified, and such\r\nqualification as existed was rather remarkable. 'The only part of the\r\naffair I should regard with real pleasure,' wrote Lord Aberdeen, 'would\r\nbe the means it might afford you of drawing closer to the government,\r\nand of naturally establishing yourself in a more suitable position; for\r\nin spite of Homer and Ulysses, your Ionian work will by no means be\r\n_tanti_ in itself.' Graham took the same point: 'An approximation to the\r\ngovernment may be fairly sought or admitted by you. But this should take\r\nplace on higher grounds.' Thus, though he was now in fact unconsciously\r\non the eve of his formal entry into a liberal cabinet, expectations\r\nstill survived that he might re-join his old party.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the wanderings of Ulysses and the geography\r\nof Homer prevailed in Mr. Gladstone's mind over the counsels of\r\nparliamentary Nestors. Besides the ancient heroes, there was the\r\nfascination of the orthodox church, so peculiar and so irresistible for\r\nthe anglican school to which Mr. Gladstone belonged. Nor must we leave\r\nout of account the passion for public business so often allied with the\r\nstudent's temperament; the desire of the politician out of work for\r\nsomething definite to do; Mr. Gladstone's keen relish at all times for\r\nany foreign travel that came in his way; finally, and perhaps strongest\r\nof all, the fact that his wife's health had been much shaken by the\r\ndeath of her sister, Lady Lyttelton, and the doctors were advising\r\nchange of scene, novel interests, and a southern climate. His decision\r\nwas very early a foregone conclusion. So his doubting friends could\r\nonly wish him good fortune. Graham said, 'If your hand be destined to\r\nlay the foundation of a Greek empire on the ruins of the Ottoman, no\r\nhand can be more worthy, no work more glorious. _Recidiva manu posuissem\r\nPergama_ was a noble aspiration;[375] with you it may be realised.'\r\n\r\n                            MISSION ACCEPTED\r\n\r\nHe hastened to enlist the services as secretary to his commission of Mr.\r\nLacaita, whose friendship he had first made seven years before, as we\r\nhave seen, amid the sinister tribunals and squalid dungeons of Naples.\r\nFor dealings with the Greco-Italian population of the islands he seemed\r\nthe very man. 'As regards Greek,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to him, 'you are\r\none of the few persons to whom one gives credit for knowing everything,\r\nand I assumed on this ground that you had a knowledge of ancient Greek,\r\nsuch as would enable you easily to acquire the _kind_ of acquaintance\r\nwith the modern form, such as is, I presume, desirable. That is my own\r\npredicament; with the additional disadvantage of our barbarous English\r\npronunciation.' Accompanied by Mrs. Gladstone and their eldest daughter,\r\nand with Mr. Arthur Gordon, the son of Lord Aberdeen, and now, after\r\nlong service to the state, known as Lord Stanmore, for private\r\nsecretary, Mr. Gladstone left England on November 8, 1858, and he\r\nreturned to it on the 8th of March 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 II\r\n\r\n                          THE IONIAN CASE\r\n\r\nThe Ionian case was this. By a treaty made at Paris in November 1815,\r\nbetween Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, the seven\r\nislands--scattered along the coast from Epiros to the extreme south of\r\nthe Morea--were constituted into a single free and independent state\r\nunder the name of the United States of the Ionian Islands, and this\r\nstate was placed under the immediate and exclusive protection of Great\r\nBritain. The Powers only thought of keeping the islands out of more\r\ndubious hands, and cared little or not at all about conferring any\r\nadvantage upon either us or the Ionians. The States were to regulate\r\ntheir own internal organisation, and Great Britain was 'to employ a\r\nparticular solicitude with regard to the legislation and general\r\nadministration of those states,' and was to appoint a lord high\r\ncommissioner to reside there with all necessary powers and authorities.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington foretold that it would prove 'a tough and\r\nunprofitable job,' and so in truth it did. A constitutional charter in\r\n1817 formed a system of government that soon became despotic enough to\r\nsatisfy Metternich himself. The scheme has been justly described as a\r\nsingularly clever piece of work, appearing to give much while in fact\r\ngiving nothing at all. It contained a decorous collection of chapters,\r\nsections, and articles imposing enough in their outer aspect, but in\r\nactual operation the whole of them reducible to a single clause enabling\r\nthe high commissioner to do whatever he pleased.\r\n\r\nThis rough but not ill-natured despotism lasted for little more than\r\nthirty years, and then in 1849, under the influence of the great\r\nupheaval of 1848, it was changed into a system of more popular and\r\ndemocratic build. The old Venetians, when for a couple of centuries they\r\nwere masters in this region, laid it down that the islanders must be\r\nkept with their teeth drawn and their claws clipped. Bread and the\r\nstick, said Father Paul, that is what they want. This view prevailed at\r\nthe colonial office, and maxims of Father Paul Sarpi's sort,\r\nincongruously combined with a paper constitution, worked as ill as\r\npossible. Mr. Gladstone always applied to the new system of 1849 Charles\r\nBuller's figure, of first lighting the fire and then stopping up the\r\nchimney. The stick may be wholesome, and local self-government may be\r\nwholesome, but in combination or rapid alternation they are apt to work\r\nnothing but mischief either in Ionian or any other islands. Sir Charles\r\nNapier--the Napier of Scinde--who had been Resident in Cephalonia thirty\r\nyears before, in Byron's closing days, describes the richer classes as\r\nlively and agreeable; the women as having both beauty and wit, but of\r\nlittle education; the poor as hardy, industrious, and intelligent--all\r\nfull of pleasant humour and vivacity, with a striking resemblance, says\r\nNapier, to his countrymen, the Irish. The upper class was mainly Italian\r\nin origin, and willingly threw all the responsibility for affairs on the\r\nBritish government. The official class, more numerous in proportion to\r\npopulation than in any country in Europe, scrambled for the petty\r\nsalaries of paltry posts allotted by popular election. Since 1849 they\r\nhad increased by twenty-five per cent., and were now one in a hundred of\r\nthe inhabitants. The clergy in a passive way took part with the\r\ndemagogues. Men of ability and sense were not wanting, but being\r\nunorganised, discouraged, and saturated with distrust, they made no\r\neffort to stem the jobbery, corruption, waste, going on around them.\r\nRoads, piers, aqueducts, and other monuments of the British protectorate\r\nreared before 1849, were falling to pieces. Taxes were indifferently\r\ncollected. Transgressors of local law went unpunished. In ten years the\r\ndeficit in the revenue had amounted to nearly L100,000, or two-thirds of\r\na year's income. The cultivators of the soil figured in official reports\r\nas naturally well affected, and only wishing to grow their currants and\r\ntheir olives in peace and quietness. But they were extremely poor, and\r\nthey were ignorant and superstitious, and being all these things it was\r\ninevitable that they should nurse discontent with their government.\r\nWhoever wanted their votes knew that the way to get them was to denounce\r\nthe Englishman as [Greek: heterodoxos kai xenos], heretic, alien, and tyrant.\r\nThere was a senate of six members, chosen by the high commissioner from\r\nthe assembly. The forty-two members of the assembly met below galleries\r\nthat held a thousand persons, and nothing made their seats and salaries\r\nso safe as round declamations from the floor to the audience above, on\r\nthe greatness of the Hellenic race and the need for union with the Greek\r\nkingdom. The municipal officer in charge of education used to set as a\r\ncopy for the children, a prayer that panhellenic concord might drive the\r\nTurks out of Greece and the English out of the seven islands.\r\n\r\nCephalonia exceeded the rest of the group both in population and in\r\nvehemence of character, while Zante came first of all in the industry\r\nand liveliness of its people.[376] These two islands were the main\r\nscene and source of difficulty. In Cephalonia nine years before the date\r\nwith which we are now dealing, an agrarian rising had occurred more like\r\na bad whiteboy outrage than a national rebellion, and it was suppressed\r\nwith cruel rigour by the high commissioner of the day. Twenty-two people\r\nhad been hanged, three hundred or more had been flogged, most of them\r\nwithout any species of judicial investigation. The fire-raisings and\r\ndestruction of houses and vineyards were of a fierce brutality to match.\r\nThese Ionian atrocities were the proceedings with which Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg had taunted Lord Aberdeen by way of rejoinder to Mr.\r\nGladstone's letters on barbarous misgovernment in Naples, and the\r\nfeelings that they had roused were still smouldering. Half a dozen\r\nnewspapers existed, all of them vehemently and irreconcilably unionist,\r\nthough all controlled by members of the legislative assembly who had\r\ntaken an oath at the beginning of each parliament to respect and\r\nmaintain the constitutional rights of the protecting sovereign. The\r\nliberty of unlicensed printing, however, had been subject to a pretty\r\nstringent check. By virtue of what was styled a power of high police,\r\nthe lord high commissioner was able at his own will and pleasure to tear\r\naway from home, occupation, and livelihood anybody that he chose, and\r\nthe high police found its commonest objects in the editors of\r\nnewspapers. An obnoxious leading article was not infrequently followed\r\nby deportation to some small and barren rock, inhabited by a handful of\r\nfishermen. Not Cherubim and Seraphim, said Mr. Gladstone, could work\r\nsuch a system. A British corporal with all the patronage in his hands,\r\nsaid another observer, would get on better than the greatest and wisest\r\nstatesman since Pericles, if he had not the patronage. It was little\r\nwonder that a distracted lord high commissioner, to adopt the similes of\r\nthe florid secretary of state, should one day send home a picture like\r\nSalvator's Massacre of the Innocents, or Michel Angelo's Last Judgment,\r\nand the next day recall the swains of Albano at repose in the landscapes\r\nof Claude; should one day advise his chiefs to wash their hands of the\r\nIonians, and on the morrow should hint that perhaps the best thing\r\nwould be by a bold _coup d'etat_ to sweep away the constitution.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                          THE STOLEN DESPATCH\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mr. Gladstone had started, what the secretary of state\r\ndescribed as the most serious misfortune conceivable happened. A\r\ndespatch was stolen from the pigeon-holes of the colonial office, and a\r\nmorning paper printed it. It had been written home some eighteen months\r\nbefore by Sir John Young, and in it he advised his government, with the\r\nassent of the contracting powers, to hand over either the whole of the\r\nseven islands to Greece, or else at least the five southern islands,\r\nwhile transforming Corfu and its little satellite of Paxo into a British\r\ncolony. It was true that a few days later he had written a private\r\nletter, wholly withdrawing this advice and substituting for it the exact\r\nopposite, the suppression namely of such freedom as the islanders\r\npossessed. This second fact the public did not know, nor would the\r\nknowledge of it have made any difference. The published despatch stood\r\non record, and say what they would, the startling impression could not\r\nbe effaced. Well might Lytton call it an inconceivable misfortune. It\r\nmade Austria uneasy, it perturbed France, and it irritated Russia, all\r\nof them seeing in Mr. Gladstone's mission a first step towards the\r\npolicy recommended in the despatch. In the breasts of the islanders it\r\nkindled intense excitement, and diversified a chronic disorder by a\r\nsharp access of fever. It made Young's position desperate, though he was\r\nslow to see it, and practically it brought the business of the high\r\ncommissioner extraordinary to nought before it had even begun.\r\n\r\nHe learned the disaster, for disaster it was, at Vienna, and appears to\r\nhave faced it with the same rigorous firmness and self-command that some\r\nof us have beheld at untoward moments long after. The ambassador told\r\nhim that he ought to see the Austrian minister. With Count Buol he had a\r\nlong interview accordingly, and assured him that his mission had no\r\nconcern with any question of Ionian annexation whether partial or total.\r\nCount Buol on his part disclaimed all aggressive tendencies in respect\r\nof Turkey, and stated emphatically that the views and conduct of Austria\r\nin her Eastern policy were in the strictest sense conservative.\r\n\r\nEmbarking at Trieste on the warship _Terrible_, Nov. 21, and after a\r\ndelightful voyage down the Adriatic, five days after leaving Vienna\r\n(Nov. 24th) Mr. Gladstone found himself at Corfu--the famous island of\r\nwhich he had read such memorable things in Thucydides and Xenophon, the\r\nharbour where the Athenians had fitted out the expedition to Syracuse,\r\nso disastrous to Greek democracy; where the young Octavian had rallied\r\nhis fleet before the battle of Actium, so critical for the foundation of\r\nthe empire of the Caesars; and whence Don John had sallied forth for the\r\nvictory of Lepanto, so fatal to the conquering might of the Ottoman\r\nTurks. It was from Corfu that the brothers Bandiera had started on their\r\ntragic enterprise for the deliverance of Italy fourteen years before.\r\nMr. Gladstone landed under a salute of seventeen guns, and was received\r\nwith all ceremony and honour by the lord high commissioner and his\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n                         ARRIVAL AT CORFU\r\n\r\nHe was not long in discovering what mischief the stolen despatch had\r\ndone, and may well have suspected from the first in his inner mind that\r\nhis efforts to undo it would bear little fruit. The morning after his\r\narrival the ten members for Corfu came to him in a body with a petition\r\nto the Queen denouncing the plan of making their island a British\r\ncolony, and praying for union with Greece. The municipality followed\r\nsuit in the evening. The whole sequel was in keeping. Mr. Gladstone with\r\nYoung's approval made a speech to the senate, in which he threw over the\r\ndespatch, severed his mission wholly from any purpose or object in the\r\nway of annexation, and dwelt much upon a circular addressed by the\r\nforeign office in London to all its ministers abroad disclaiming any\r\ndesigns of that kind. He held levees, he called upon the archbishop, he\r\nreceived senators and representatives, and everywhere he held the same\r\nemphatic language. He soon saw enough to convince him of the harm done\r\nto British credit and influence by the severities in Cephalonia; by the\r\nsmall regard and frequent contempt shown by many Englishmen for the\r\nreligion of the people for whose government they were responsible; by\r\nthe diatribes in the London press against the Ionians as brigands,\r\npirates, and barbarians; and by the absence in high commissioners and\r\nothers 'of tact, good sense, and good feeling in the sense in which it\r\nis least common in England, the sense namely in which it includes a\r\ndisposition to enter into and up to a certain point sympathise with,\r\nthose who differ with us in race, language, and creed.' Perhaps his\r\npenetrating eye early discovered to him that forty years of bad rule had\r\nso embittered feeling, that even without the stolen despatch, he had\r\nlittle chance.\r\n\r\nHe made a cruise round the islands. His visit shook him a good deal with\r\nrespect to two of the points--Corfu and Ithaca--on which it has been\r\ncustomary to dwell as proving Homer's precise local knowledge. The rain\r\npoured in torrents for most of the time, but it cleared up for a space\r\nto reveal the loveliness of Ithaca. In the island of Ulysses and\r\nPenelope he danced at a ball given in his honour. In Cephalonia he was\r\nreceived by a tumultuous mob of a thousand persons, whom neither the\r\ndrenching rains nor the unexpected manner of his approach across the\r\nhills could baffle. They greeted him with incessant cries for union with\r\nGreece, thrust disaffected papers into his carriage, and here and there\r\nindulged in cries of [Greek: kato e prostasia], down with the protectorate,\r\ndown with the tyranny of fifty years. This exceptional disrespect he\r\nascribed to what he leniently called the history of Cephalonia, meaning\r\nthe savage dose of martial law nine years before. He justly took it for\r\na marked symbol of the state of excitement at which under various\r\ninfluences the popular mind had arrived. Age and infirmity prevented the\r\narchbishop from coming to offer his respects, so after his levee Mr.\r\nGladstone with his suite repaired to the archbishop. 'We found him,'\r\nsays Mr. Gordon, 'seated on a sofa dressed in his most gorgeous robes of\r\ngold and purple, over which flowed down a long white beard.... Behind\r\nhim stood a little court of black-robed, black-bearded, black-capped,\r\ndark-faced priests. He is eighty-six years old, and his manners and\r\nappearance were dignified in the extreme. Speaking slowly and distinctly\r\nhe began to tell Gladstone that the sole wish of Cephalonia was to be\r\nunited to Greece, and there was something very exciting and affecting in\r\nthe tremulous tones of the old man saying over and over again, \"_questa\r\ninfelice isola, questa isola infelice_,\" as the tears streamed down his\r\ncheeks and long silvery beard. It was like a scene in a play.'\r\n\r\nAt Zante (Dec. 15), the surface was smoother. A concourse of several\r\nthousands awaited him; Greek flags were flying on all sides in the\r\nstrong morning sea-breeze; the town bands played Greek national tunes;\r\nthe bells were all ringing; the harbour was covered with boats full of\r\ngaily dressed people; and the air resounded with loud shouts [Greek: zeto ho\r\nphilellen Gladston, zeto he henosis meta tes Hellados], Long live\r\nGladstone the Philhellene, hurrah for union with Greece.\r\n\r\n     Every room and passage in the residency, Mr. Gordon writes to Lord\r\n     Aberdeen, was already thronged.... Upstairs the excitement was\r\n     great, and as soon as Gladstone had taken his place, in swept\r\n     Gerasimus the bishop (followed by scores of swarthy priests in\r\n     their picturesque black robes) and tendered to him the petition for\r\n     union. But before he could deliver it, Gladstone stopped him and\r\n     addressed to him and to the assembly a speech in excellent Italian.\r\n     Never did I hear his beautiful voice ring out more clear or more\r\n     thrillingly than when he said, '_Ecco l' inganno_.'... It was a\r\n     scene not to be forgotten. The priests, with eye and hand and\r\n     gesture, expressed in lively pantomime to each other the effect\r\n     produced by each sentence, in what we should think a most\r\n     exaggerated way, like a chorus on the stage, but the effect was\r\n     most picturesque.\r\n\r\n                            VISITS ATHENS\r\n\r\nHe attended a banquet one night, went to the theatre the next, where he\r\nwas greeted with lusty zetos, and at midnight embarked on the\r\n_Terrible_ on his way to Athens. His stay in the immortal city only\r\nlasted for three or four days, and I find no record of his impressions.\r\nThey were probably those of most travellers educated enough to feel the\r\nspell of the Violet Crown. Illusions as to the eternal summer with which\r\npoets have blessed the Isles of Greece vanished as they found deep snow\r\nin the streets, icicles on the Acropolis, and snow-balling in the\r\nParthenon. He had a reception only a shade less cordial than if he were\r\nDemosthenes come back. He dined with King Otho, and went to a _Te Deum_\r\nin honour of the Queen's birthday. Finlay, the learned man who had more\r\nof the true spirit of history than most historians then alive, took him\r\nto a meeting of the legislature; he beheld some of the survivors of the\r\nwar of independence, and made friends with one valiant lover of freedom,\r\nthe veteran General Church. Though, thanks to the generosity of an\r\nEnglishman, they had a university of their own at Corfu, the Ionians\r\npreferred to send their sons to Athens, and the Athenian students\r\nimmediately presented a memorial to Mr. Gladstone with the usual prayer\r\nfor union with the Hellenic kingdom. On the special object of his visit,\r\nhe came away from Athens with the impression that opinion in Greece was\r\nmuch divided on the question of immediate union with the Ionian islands.\r\nIn truth his position had been a false one. Everybody was profoundly\r\ndeferential, but nobody was quite sure whether he had come to pave the\r\nway for union, or to invite the Athenian government to check it, and\r\nwhen Rangabe, the foreign minister, found him without credentials or\r\ninstructions, and staved off all discussion, Mr. Gladstone must have\r\nfelt that though he had seen one of the two or three most wondrous\r\nhistoric sites on the globe, that was all.\r\n\r\n                               IN ALBANIA\r\n\r\nOf a jaunt to wilder scenes a letter of Mr. Arthur Gordon's gives a\r\npleasant glimpse:--\r\n\r\n     You will like an account of an expedition the whole party made\r\n     yesterday to Albania to pay a visit to an old lady, a great\r\n     proprietress, who lives in a large ruinous castle at a place called\r\n     Filates. She is about the greatest personage in these regions, and\r\n     it was thought that the lord high commissioner should pay her a\r\n     visit if he wished to see Albania.... It was a lovely morning, and\r\n     breakfast was laid on the balcony of the private apartments looking\r\n     over the garden and commanding the loveliest of views across the\r\n     strait. Gladstone was in the highest spirits, full of talk and\r\n     _romping boyishly_. After breakfast the L.H.C.'s barge and the\r\n     cutters of the _Terrible_ conveyed us on board the pretty little\r\n     gunboat.\r\n\r\n     We reached Sayada in about two hours, and were received on landing\r\n     by the governor of the province, who had ridden down from Filates\r\n     to meet us. We went to the house of the English vice-consul, whilst\r\n     the long train of horses was preparing to start, but after a few\r\n     minutes' stay there Gladstone became irrepressibly restless, and\r\n     insisted on setting off to walk--I of course walked too. The old\r\n     steward also went with us, and a guard of eight white-kilted\r\n     palikari on foot. The rest of the party rode, and from a slight\r\n     hill which we soon reached, it was very pretty to look back at the\r\n     long procession starting from Sayada and proceeding along the\r\n     narrow causeway running parallel to our path, the figures\r\n     silhouetted against the sea. Filates is about 12 miles from Sayada,\r\n     perhaps more, the path is rugged and mountainous, and commands some\r\n     fine views. Our palikari guards fired off their long Afghan-looking\r\n     guns in every direction, greatly to Gladstone's annoyance, but\r\n     there was no stopping them.\r\n\r\n     Scouts on the hills gave warning of our approach, and at the\r\n     entrance to Filates we were met by the whole population. First the\r\n     Valideh's retainers, then the elders, then the moolahs in their\r\n     great green turbans, the Christian community, and finally, on the\r\n     top of the hill, the Valideh's little grandson, gorgeously dressed,\r\n     and attended by his tutor and a number of black slaves. The little\r\n     boy salaamed to Gladstone with much grace and self-possession, and\r\n     then conducted us to the castle, in front of which all the\r\n     townsfolk who were not engaged in receiving us were congregated in\r\n     picturesque groups on the smooth grassy lawns and under the great\r\n     plane trees. The castle is a large ruinous enclosure of walls and\r\n     towers, with buildings of all sorts and ages within. The Valideh\r\n     herself, attired in green silk and a fur pelisse, her train held by\r\n     two negro female slaves, received us at the head of the stairs and\r\n     ushered us into a large room with a divan round three sides of it.\r\n     Sweetmeats and water and pipes and coffee were brought as usual,\r\n     some of the cups and their filigree stands very handsome. We went\r\n     out to see the town, preceded by a tall black slave in a gorgeous\r\n     blue velvet jacket, with a great silver stick in his hand. Under\r\n     his guidance we visited the khans, the bazaar, and the mosque; not\r\n     only were we allowed to enter the mosque with our shoes on, but on\r\n     Gladstone expressing a wish to hear the call to prayer, the muezzin\r\n     was sent up to the top of the minaret to call the azan two hours\r\n     before the proper time. The sight of the green-turbaned imam crying\r\n     the azan for a Frank was most singular, and the endless variety of\r\n     costume displayed by the crowds who thronged the verandahs which\r\n     surround the mosque was most picturesque. The gateway of the castle\r\n     too was a picturesque scene. Retainers and guards, slaves and\r\n     soldiers, and even women, were lounging about, and a beautiful tame\r\n     little pet roedeer played with the pretty children in bright\r\n     coloured dresses, clustering under the cavernous archway.\r\n\r\n     We had dinner in another large room. I counted thirty-two dishes,\r\n     or I may say courses, for each dish at a Turkish dinner is brought\r\n     in separately, and it is rude not to eat of all! The most\r\n     picturesque part of the dinner, and most unusual, was the way the\r\n     room was lighted. Eight tall, grand Albanians stood like statues\r\n     behind us, each holding a candle. It reminded me of the\r\n     torch-bearers who won the laird his bet in the _Legend of\r\n     Montrose_.\r\n\r\n     After dinner there was a long and somewhat tedious interval of\r\n     smoking and story-telling in the dark, and we called upon Lacaita\r\n     to recite Italian poetry, which he did with much effect, pouring\r\n     out sonnet after sonnet of Petrarch, including that which my father\r\n     thinks the most beautiful in the Italian language, that which has\r\n     in it the 'Campeggiar del angelico riso.' This showed me how easy\r\n     it was to fall into the habits of a country. Gladstone is as\r\n     unoriental as any man well can be, yet his calling on Lacaita to\r\n     recite was really just the same thing that every Pasha does after\r\n     dinner, when he orders his tale-teller to repeat a story. The\r\n     ladies meanwhile were packed off to the harem for the night, Lady\r\n     Bowen acting as their interpreter. My L.H.C., his two\r\n     secretaries, his three aide-de-camps, Captains Blomfield and\r\n     Clanricarde, and the vice-consul, all slept in the same room, and\r\n     that not a large one, and we were packed tight on the floor, under\r\n     quilts of Brusa silk and gold, tucked up round us by gorgeous\r\n     Albanians. Gladstone amused himself with speculating whether or no\r\n     we were in contravention of the provisions of Lord Shaftesbury's\r\n     lodging-house act!\r\n\r\n     After a month of cloudless sunshine it took it into its head to\r\n     rain this night of all nights in the year, and rain as it only does\r\n     in these regions. Gladstone and I walked down again despite of\r\n     wind, rain, and mud, and our palikari guard--to keep up their\r\n     spirits, I suppose--chanted wild choruses all the way. We nearly\r\n     got stuck altogether in the muddy flat near Sayada, and got on\r\n     board the _Osprey_ wet through, my hands so chilled I could hardly\r\n     steer the boat. Of course we had far outwalked the riding party, so\r\n     we had to wait. What a breakfast we ate! that is those of us who\r\n     could eat, for the passage was rough and Gladstone and the ladies\r\n     flat on their backs and very sorry for themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's comment in his diary is brief: 'The whole impression is\r\nsaddening; it is all indolence, decay, stagnation; the image of God\r\nseems as if it were nowhere. But there is much of wild and picturesque.'\r\nThe English in the island, both civil and military, adopted the tone of\r\nunfriendly journals in London, and the garrison went so far as not even\r\nto invite Mr. Gladstone to mess, a compliment never omitted before. The\r\nIonians, on the other hand, like people in most other badly governed\r\ncountries did not show in the noblest colours. There were petitions,\r\nletters, memorials, as to which Mr. Gladstone mildly notes that he has\r\nto 'lament a spirit of exaggeration and obvious errors of fact.' There\r\nwas a stream of demands from hosts of Spiridiones, Christodulos,\r\nEuphrosunes, for government employ, and the memorial survives, attested\r\nby bishop and clergy, of a man with a daughter to marry, who being too\r\npoor to find a dowry 'had decided on reverting to your Excellency's\r\nwell-known philhellenism, and with tears in his eyes besought that your\r\nExcellency,' et cetera.\r\n\r\n                     CORRESPONDENCE WITH BULWER\r\n\r\nOne incident was much disliked at home, as having the fearsome flavour\r\nof the Puseyite. It had been customary at levees for the lord high\r\ncommissioner to bow to everybody, but also to shake hands with the\r\nbishops and sundry other high persons. Mr. Gladstone stooped and\r\nactually kissed the bishop's hand. Sir Edward Lytton inquired if the\r\nstory were true, as a question might be asked in parliament. It is true,\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone (February 7), but 'I hope Sir E. L. will not in his\r\nconsideration for me entangle himself in such a matter, but as he knows\r\nnothing now, will continue to know nothing, and will say that the\r\nsubject did not enter into his instructions, and that he presumes I\r\nshall be at home in two or three more weeks to answer for all my\r\nmisdeeds.'[378]\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state and his potent emissary--the radical who had\r\nturned tory and the tory who was on the verge of formally turning\r\nliberal--got on excellently together. Though he was not exact in\r\nbusiness, the minister's despatches and letters show shrewdness, good\r\nsense, and right feeling, with a copious garnish of flummery. Demagogy,\r\nhe says to Mr. Gladstone, will continue to be a trade and the most\r\nfascinating of all trades, because animated by personal vanity, and its\r\nvenality disguised even to the demagogue himself by the love of country,\r\nby which it may be really accompanied. The Ionian constitution should\r\ncertainly be mended, for 'my convictions tell me that there is nothing\r\nso impracticable as the Unreal.' He comforts his commissioner by the\r\nreminder that a population after all has one great human heart, and a\r\ngreat human heart is that which chiefly exalts the Man of Genius over\r\nthe mere Man of Talent, so that when a Man of Genius with practical\r\nexperience of the principles of sound government comes face to face with\r\na people whose interest it is to be governed well, the chances are that\r\nthey will understand each other.\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone applied himself with the utmost gravity to the affairs of\r\na pygmy state with a total population under 250,000. His imagination did\r\nits work. While you seem, he said most truly, to be dealing only with a\r\nfew specks scarcely visible on the map of Europe, you are engaged in\r\nsolving a problem as delicate and difficult as if it arose on a far more\r\nconspicuous stage. The people he found to be eminently gifted by nature\r\nwith that subtlety which is apt to degenerate into sophistry, and prone\r\nto be both rather light-minded and extremely suspicious. The permanent\r\nofficials in Downing Street, with less polite analysis, had been\r\naccustomed to regard the islanders more bluntly as a 'pack of scamps.'\r\nThis was what had done the mischief. The material condition of the\r\ncultivators was in some respects not bad, but Mr. Gladstone laid down a\r\nprofound and solid principle when he said that 'no method of dealing\r\nwith a civilised community can be satisfactory which does not make\r\nprovision for its political action as well as its social state.'[379]\r\nThe idea of political reform had for a time made head against the idea\r\nof union with the Greek kingdom, but for some years past the whole\r\nstream of popular tendency and feeling set strongly towards union, and\r\ndisdained contentment with anything else. Mankind turn naturally to the\r\nsolutions that seem the simplest. Mr. Gladstone condemned the existing\r\nsystem as bad for us and bad for them. Circumstances made it impossible\r\nfor him to suggest amendment by throwing the burden bodily off our\r\nshoulders, and at that time he undoubtedly regarded union with Greece as\r\nin itself undesirable for the Ionians. Circumstances and his own love of\r\nfreedom made it equally impossible to recommend the violent suppression\r\nof the constitution. The only course left open was to turn the mockery\r\nof free government into a reality, and this operation he proposed to\r\ncarry out with a bold hand. The details of this enlargement of popular\r\nrights and privileges, and the accompanying financial purgation, do not\r\nnow concern us. Whether the case either demanded or permitted\r\noriginality in the way of construction I need not discuss. The\r\nmanufacture of a constitution is always the easiest thing in the world.\r\nThe question is whether the people concerned will work it, and in spite\r\nof that buoyant optimism which never in any circumstances deserted him\r\nin respect of whatever business he might have in hand, Mr. Gladstone\r\nmust have doubted whether his islanders would ever pretend to accept\r\nwhat they did not seek, as a substitute for what they did seek but were\r\nnot allowed to have. Before anybody knew the scope of his plan, the six\r\nnewspapers flew to arms with a vivacity that, whether it was Italian or\r\nwas Greek, was in either case a fatal sign of the public temper. What,\r\nthey cried, did the treaty of 1815 mean by describing the Ionian state\r\nas free and independent? What was a protectorate, and what the rights of\r\nthe protector? Was there no difference between a protector and a\r\nsovereign? What could be more arrogant and absurd than that the\r\nprotector, who was not sovereign, should talk about 'conceding' reforms\r\nto a free and independent state? All these questions were in themselves\r\nnot very easy to answer, but what was a more serious obstacle than the\r\nargumentative puzzles of partisans was a want of moral and political\r\ncourage; was the sycophancy of one class, and the greediness of\r\nothers.[380]\r\n\r\n                      CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the recommendations of constitutional reform was\r\nthe question by whom the necessary communications with the assembly were\r\nto be conducted. Sir John Young was obviously impossible, though he was\r\nnot at once brought to face the fact. Mr. Gladstone upon this made to\r\nthe colonial secretary (December 27) an offer that if he had already\r\ndetermined on Young's recall, and if he thought reform would stand a\r\nbetter chance if introduced by Mr. Gladstone himself, he was willing to\r\nserve as lord high commissioner for the very limited time that might be\r\nnecessary. We may be sure that the government lost not an hour in making\r\nup their minds on a plan that went still further both in the way of\r\nbringing Mr. Gladstone into still closer connection with them, and\r\ntowards relieving themselves of a responsibility which they never from\r\nthe first had any business to devolve upon Mr. Gladstone or anybody\r\nelse. The answer came by telegraph (January 11), 'The Queen accepts.\r\nYour commission is being made out.'\r\n\r\nAll other embarrassments were now infinitely aggravated by the sudden\r\ndiscovery from the lawyers that acceptance of the new office not only\r\nvacated the seat in parliament, but also rendered Mr. Gladstone\r\nincapable of election until he had ceased to hold the office. 'This, I\r\nmust confess,' he told Sir Edward, 'is a great blow. The difficulty and\r\nthe detriment are serious' (January 17). If some enemy on the meeting of\r\nthe House in February should choose to move the writ for the vacant seat\r\nat Oxford, the election would necessarily take place at a date too early\r\nfor the completion of the business at Corfu, and Mr. Gladstone still at\r\nwork as high commissioner would still therefore be ineligible. Nobody\r\nwas ever by constitution more averse than Mr. Gladstone to turning\r\nbackward, and in this case he felt himself especially bound to go\r\nforward not only by the logic of the Ionian situation at the moment, but\r\nfor the reason which was also characteristic of him, that the Queen in\r\napproving his appointment (January 7) had described his conduct as both\r\npatriotic and most opportune, and therefore he thought there would be\r\nunspeakable shabbiness in turning round upon her by a hurried\r\nwithdrawal. The Oxford entanglement thus became almost desperate.\r\nResolved not to disturb the settled order of proceeding with his\r\nassembly, Mr. Gladstone with a thoroughly characteristic union of\r\ningenuity and tenacity tried various ways of extrication. To complete\r\nthe mortifications of the position, the telegraph broke down.\r\n\r\n                   QUESTION OF THE OXFORD SEAT\r\n\r\nThe scrape was nearly as harassing to his friends at home as to\r\nhimself. Politicians above all men can never safely count on the charity\r\nthat thinketh no evil. Lord John Russell told Lord Aberdeen that it was\r\nclear that Gladstone was staying away to avoid a discussion on the\r\ncoming Reform bill. There was a violent attack upon him in the _Times_\r\n(January 13) as having supplanted Young. The writers of leading articles\r\nlooked up Greek history from the days of the visit of Ulysses to\r\nAlcinous downwards, and they mocked his respect for the countrymen of\r\nMiltiades, and his reverence for the church of Chrysostom and\r\nAthanasius. The satirists of the cleverest journal of the day admitted\r\nhis greatness, the brilliance and originality of his finance, the\r\nincomparable splendour of his eloquence, and a courage equal to any\r\nundertaking, that quailed before no opposition and suffered no abatement\r\nin defeat, and they only marvelled the more that a statesman of the\r\nfirst rank should accept at the hands of an insidious rival a fifth-rate\r\nmission--insidious rival not named but easy to identify. The fact that\r\nMr. Gladstone had hired a house at Corfu was the foundation of a\r\ntranscendent story that Mr. Disraeli wished to make him the king of the\r\nIonian islands. 'I hardly think it needful to assure you,' Mr. Gladstone\r\ntold Lytton, 'that I have never attached the smallest weight to any of\r\nthe insinuations which it seems people have thought worth while to\r\nlaunch at some member or members of your government with respect to my\r\nmission.' Though Mr. Gladstone was never by any means unconscious of the\r\nhum and buzz of paltriness and malice that often surrounds conspicuous\r\npublic men, nobody was ever more regally indifferent. Graham predicted\r\nthat though Gladstone would always be the first man in the House of\r\nCommons, he would not again be what he was before the Ionian business.\r\nThey all thought that he would be attacked on his return. '_Ah_,' said\r\nAberdeen, '_but he is terrible in the rebound_.'\r\n\r\nAfter much perplexity and running to and fro in London, it was arranged\r\nbetween the secretary of state and Mr. Gladstone's friends, including\r\nPhillimore principally, and then Northcote and M. Bernard, that a course\r\nof proceeding should be followed, which Mr. Gladstone when he knew it\r\nthought unfortunate. A new commission naming a successor was issued, and\r\nMr. Gladstone then became _ipso facto_ liberated. Sir Henry Storks was\r\nthe officer chosen, and as soon as his commission was formally received\r\nby him, he was to execute a warrant under which he deputed all powers to\r\nMr. Gladstone until his arrival. Whether Mr. Gladstone was lord high\r\ncommissioner when he came to propose his reform is a moot point. So\r\nintricate was the puzzle that the under-secretary addressed a letter to\r\nMr. Gladstone by his name and not by the style of his official dignity,\r\nbecause he could not be at all sure what that official dignity really\r\nwas. What is certain is that Mr. Gladstone, though it was never his way\r\nto quarrel with other people's action taken in good faith on his behalf,\r\ndid not perceive the necessity for proceeding so rapidly to the\r\nappointment of his successor, and thought it decidedly injurious to such\r\nchances as his reforms might have possessed.[381]\r\n\r\nThe assembly that had been convoked by Sir John Young for an\r\nextraordinary session (January 25), at once showed that its labours\r\nwould bear no fruit. Mr. Gladstone as lord high commissioner opened the\r\nsession with a message that they had met to consider proposals for\r\nreform which he desired to lay before them as soon as possible. The game\r\nbegan with the passing of a resolution that it was the single and\r\nunanimous _will_ ([Greek: thelesis]) of the Ionian people that the seven\r\nislands should be united to Greece. Mr. Gladstone fought like a lion for\r\nscholar's authority to treat the word as only meaning wish or\r\ndisposition, and he took for touchstone the question whether men could\r\nspeak of the [Greek: thelesis] of the Almighty; the word in the Lord's\r\nPrayer was found to be [Greek: thelema]. As Finlay truly says, it would\r\nhave been much more to the point to accept the word as it was meant by\r\nthose who used it. As to that no mistake was possible. Some say that he\r\nought plainly to have told them they had violated the constitution, to\r\nhave dissolved them, and above all to have stopped their pay. Instead of\r\nthis he informed them that they must put their wishes into the shape of\r\na petition to the Queen. The idea was seized with alacrity (January 29).\r\nOligarchs and demagogues were equally pleased to fall in with it, the\r\nformer because they hoped it would throw their rivals into deeper\r\ndiscredit with their common master, the latter because they knew it\r\nwould endear them to their constituents.\r\n\r\n                   OPENING OF THE IONIAN SESSION\r\n\r\nThe Corfiotes received the declaration of the assembly and the address\r\nto the Queen with enthusiasm. Great crowds followed the members to their\r\nhomes with joyous acclamations, all the bells of the town were set\r\nringing, there was a grand illumination for two nights, and the\r\narchbishop ordered a _Te Deum_. Neither te-deums nor prayers melted the\r\nheart of the British cabinet, aware of the truth impressed at the time\r\non Mr. Gladstone by Lytton, that neither the English public nor the\r\nEnglish parliament likes any policy that '_gives anything up_.' The\r\nQueen was advised to reply that she could neither consent to abandon the\r\nobligations she had undertaken, nor could permit any application from\r\nthe islands to other Powers in furtherance of any similar design.\r\n\r\nThen at last came the grand plan for constitutional reconstruction. Mr.\r\nGladstone after first stating the reply of the Queen, read an eloquent\r\naddress to the assembly (February 4) in Italian, adjuring them to reject\r\nall attempts to evade by any indirect devices the duty of pronouncing a\r\nclear and intelligible judgment on the propositions now laid before\r\nthem. His appeal was useless, and it was received exactly as plans for\r\nassimilating Irish administration to English used to be. The\r\nnationalists knew that reform would be a difficulty the more in the way\r\nof separation, the retrogrades knew it would be a spoke in the wheel of\r\ntheir own jobbery. Mr. Gladstone professed extreme and truly\r\ncharacteristic astonishment in respect of the address to the Queen, that\r\nthey should regard the permission to ask as identical with the promise\r\nto grant, and the right to petition as equivalent to the right to\r\ndemand. If the affair had been less practically vexatious, we can\r\nimagine the Socratic satisfaction with which Mr. Gladstone would have\r\nrevelled in pressing all these and many other distinctions on those who\r\nboasted of being Socrates' fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day anxiously did Mr. Gladstone watch what he called the\r\ndodges of the assembly. Abundant reason as there was to complain of the\r\nconduct of the Ionians in all these proceedings, it is well to record\r\nthe existence of a number of sincere patriots and enlightened men like\r\nthe two brothers Themistocles, Napoleon Zambelli, and Sir Peter Braila,\r\nafterwards Greek minister in London. This small band of royal adherents\r\ngave Mr. Gladstone all the help they could in preparing his scheme of\r\nreform, and after the scheme was launched, they strained every nerve to\r\ninduce the assembly to assent to it in spite of the pressure from the\r\npeople. Their efforts were necessarily unavailing. The great majority,\r\ncomposed as usual of the friends of England who trembled for their own\r\njobs, joining hands with the demagogues, was hostile to the changes\r\nproposed, and only flinched from a peremptory vote from doubt as to its\r\nreception among the people. Promptitude and force were not to be\r\nexpected in either way from men in such a frame of mind. 'On a\r\npreliminary debate,' Mr. Gladstone wrote mournfully to Phillimore,\r\n'without any motion whatever, one man has spoken for nearly the whole of\r\ntwo days.' Strong language about the proposals as cheating and\r\nfraudulent was freely used, but nothing that in Mr. Gladstone's view\r\njustified one of those high-handed prorogations after the manner of the\r\nStuarts, that had been the usual expedient in quarrels between the high\r\ncommissioner and a recalcitrant assembly. These doings had brought\r\nEnglish rule over the islands to a level in the opinion of Southern\r\nEurope with Austrian rule at Venice and the reign of the cardinals in\r\nthe pontifical states.\r\n\r\n                       PROCEEDINGS IN ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nSir Henry Storks arrived on the 16th of February, and the same day the\r\nassembly which before had been working for delay, in a great hurry gave\r\na vote against the proposals, which, though in form preliminary, was in\r\nsubstance decisive; there were only seven dissentients. Mr. Gladstone\r\nsums up the case in a private letter to Sidney Herbert.\r\n\r\n     _Corfu, 17th Feb. 1859._--This decision is not convenient for me\r\n     personally, nor for the government at home; but as a whole I cannot\r\n     regret it so far as England is concerned. I think the proposals\r\n     give here almost for the first time a perfectly honourable and\r\n     tenable position in the face of the islands. The first set of\r\n     manoeuvres was directed to preventing them from being made; and that\r\n     made me really uneasy. The only point of real importance was to get\r\n     them out.... Do not hamper yourself in this affair with me. Let me\r\n     sink or swim. I have been labouring for truth and justice, and am\r\n     sufficiently happy in the consciousness of it, to be little\r\n     distressed either with the prospect of blame, or with the more\r\n     serious question whether I acted rightly or wrongly in putting\r\n     myself in the place of L.H.C. to propose these reforms,--a step\r\n     which has of course been much damaged by the early nomination of\r\n     Sir H. Storks, done out of mere consideration for me in another\r\n     point of view. Lytton's conduct throughout has been such that I\r\n     could have expected no more from the oldest and most confiding\r\n     friend.\r\n\r\nTo Lytton himself he writes (Feb. 7, 1859):--\r\n\r\n     I sincerely wish that I could have repaid your generous confidence\r\n     and admirable support with recommendations suited to the immediate\r\n     convenience of your government. But in sending me, you grappled\r\n     with a difficulty which you might have postponed, and I could not\r\n     but do the same. Whether it was right that I should come, I do not\r\n     feel very certain. Yet (stolen despatch and all) I do not regret\r\n     it. For my feelings are those you have so admirably described; and\r\n     I really do not know for what it is that political life is worth\r\n     the living, if it be not for an opportunity of endeavouring to\r\n     redeem in the face of the world the character of our country\r\n     wherever, it matters not on how small a scale, that character has\r\n     been compromised.\r\n\r\nLanguage like this, as sincere as it was lofty, supplies the true test\r\nby which to judge Mr. Gladstone's conduct both in the Ionian transaction\r\nand many another. From the point of personal and selfish interest any\r\nsimpleton might see that he made a mistake, but measured by his own\r\nstandard of public virtue, how is he to be blamed, how is he not to be\r\napplauded, for undertaking a mission that, but for an unforeseen\r\naccident, might have redounded to the honour and the credit of the\r\nBritish power?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  V\r\n\r\nOn February 19 he quitted the scene of so many anxieties and such\r\nstrenuous effort as we have seen. The _Terrible_ fell into a strong\r\nnorth-easter in the Adriatic, and took thirty-six hours to Pola. There\r\nthey sought shelter and got across with a smooth sea to Venice on the\r\n23rd. He saw the Austrian archduke whom he found kind, intelligent,\r\nearnest, pleasing. At Turin a few days later (March 23), he had an\r\ninterview with Cavour, for whom at that moment the crowning scenes of\r\nhis great career were just opening. 'At Vicenza,' the diary records\r\n(Feb. 28), 'we had cavalry and artillery at the station about to march;\r\nmore cavalry on the road with a van and pickets, some with drawn swords;\r\nat Verona regiments in review; at Milan pickets in the streets; as I\r\nwrite I hear the tread of horse patrolling the streets. Dark omens!' The\r\nwar with Austria was close at hand.\r\n\r\nI may as well in a few sentences finally close the Ionian chapter,\r\nthough the consummation was not immediate. Mr. Gladstone, while he was\r\nfor the moment bitten by the notion of ceding the southern islands to\r\nGreece, was no more touched by the nationalist aspirations of the\r\nIonians than he had been by nationalism and unification in Italy in\r\n1851. Just as in Italy he clung to constitutional reforms in the\r\nparticular provinces and states as the key to regeneration, so here he\r\nleaned upon the moderates who, while professing strong nationalist\r\nfeeling, did not believe that the time for its realisation had arrived.\r\nA debate was raised in the House of Commons in the spring of 1861, by an\r\nIrish member. The Irish catholics twitted Mr. Gladstone with flying the\r\nflag of nationality in Italy, and trampling on it in the Ionian islands.\r\nHe in reply twitted them with crying up nationality for the Greeks, and\r\nrunning it down when it told against the pope. In the Italian case Lord\r\nJohn Russell had (1860) set up the broad doctrine that a people are the\r\nonly true judges who should be their rulers--a proposition that was at\r\nonce seized and much used by the Dandolos, Lombardos, Cavalieratos and\r\nthe rest at Corfu. Scarcely anybody pretended that England had any\r\nseparate or selfish interest of her own. 'It is in my view,' said Mr.\r\nGladstone, 'entirely a matter of that kind of interest only, which, is\r\nin one sense the highest interest of all--namely the interest which is\r\ninherent in her character and duty, and her exact and regular fulfilment\r\nof obligations which she has contracted with Europe.'[382]\r\n\r\n                    LATER FORTUNES OF THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nBut he held the opinion that it would be nothing less than a crime\r\nagainst the safety of Europe, as connected with the state and course of\r\nthe Eastern question, if England were at this moment to surrender the\r\nprotectorate; for if you should surrender the protectorate, what were\r\nyou to say to Candia, Thessaly, Albania, and other communities of Greek\r\nstock still under Turkish rule? Then there was a military question.\r\nLarge sums of British money had been flung away on fortifications,[383]\r\nand people talked of Corfu as they talked in later years about Cyprus,\r\nas a needed supplement to the strength of Gibraltar and Malta, and\r\nindispensable to our Mediterranean power. People listened agape to\r\ndemonstrations that the Ionian islands were midway between England and\r\nthe Persian Gulf; that they were two-thirds of the way to the Red Sea;\r\nthat they blocked up the mouth of the Adriatic; Constantinople, Smyrna,\r\nAlexandria, Naples, formed a belt of great towns around them; they were\r\ncentral to Asia, Europe, and Africa. And so forth in the alarmist's\r\nwell-worn currency.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston in 1850 had declared in his highest style that Corfu was\r\na very important position for Mediterranean interests in the event of a\r\nwar, and it would be great folly to give it up. A year later he repeated\r\nthat though he should not object to the annexation of the southern\r\nislands to Greece, Corfu was too important a military and naval post\r\never to be abandoned by us.[384] As Lord Palmerston changed, so did Mr.\r\nGladstone change. 'Without a good head for Greece, I should not like to\r\nsee the Ionian protectorate surrendered; with it, I should be well\r\npleased for one to be responsible for giving it up.' Among many other\r\nwonderful suggestions was one that he should himself become that 'good\r\nhead.' 'The first mention,' he wrote to a correspondent in parliament\r\n(Jan. 21, 1863), 'of my candidature in Greece some time ago made me\r\nlaugh very heartily, for though I do love the country and never laughed\r\nat anything else in connection with it before, yet the seeing my own\r\nname, which in my person was never meant to carry a title of any kind,\r\nplaced in juxtaposition with that particular idea, made me give way.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is safe to conjecture, for the period with which in this\r\nchapter we are immediately concerned, that in conceiving and drawing up\r\nhis Ionian scheme, close contact with liberal doctrines as to free\r\ninstitutions and popular government must have quickened Mr. Gladstone's\r\nprogress in liberal doctrines in our own affairs at home. In 1863[385]\r\nLord Palmerston himself, in spite of that national aversion to anything\r\nlike giving up, of which he was himself the most formidable\r\nrepresentative, cheerfully handed the Ionians over to their kinsfolk, if\r\nkinsfolk they truly were, upon the mainland.[386]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[375] Virg. _Aen._ iv. 344.\r\n\r\n[376] See Sir C.

They were printed for the use of the cabinet,\r\nthough whether these fifty large pages, amounting to about a quarter of\r\nthis volume, received much attention from that body, may without\r\n_scandalum magnatum_ be doubted, nor do the reports appear to have been\r\nlaid before parliament. The Italian war was then creating an agitation\r\nin Europe upon nationality, as to which the people of the Ionian islands\r\nwere sensitively alive, and the reports would have supplied a good deal\r\nof fuel. There was a separate fourth report upon the suppression of\r\ndisorder in Cephalonia in 1848, which everybody afterwards agreed that\r\nit was not expedient to publish. It still exists in the archives of the\r\ncolonial office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                       JUNCTION WITH THE LIBERALS\r\n\r\n                               (_1859_)\r\n\r\n     Conviction, in spite of early associations and long-cherished\r\n     preposessions--strong conviction, and an overpowering sense of the\r\n     public interests operating for many, many years before full effect\r\n     was given to it, placed me in the ranks of the liberal\r\n     party.--GLADSTONE (Ormskirk, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone returned to England in March 1859, he found the\r\nconservatives with much ineffectual industry, some misplaced ingenuity,\r\nand many misgivings and divisions, trying their hands at parliamentary\r\nreform. Their infringement of what passed for a liberal patent was not\r\nturning out well. Convulsions in the cabinet, murmurs in the lobbies,\r\nresistance from the opposite benches, all showed that a ministry\r\nexisting on sufferance would not at that stage be allowed to settle the\r\nquestion. In this contest Mr. Gladstone did not actively join. Speaking\r\nfrom the ministerial side of the House, he made a fervid defence of\r\nnomination boroughs as the nurseries of statesmen, but he voted with\r\nministers against a whig amendment. His desire, he said, was to settle\r\nthe question as soon as possible, always, however, on the foundation of\r\ntrust in the people, that 'sound and satisfactory basis on which for\r\nseveral years past legislation had been proceeding.' The hostile\r\namendment was carried against ministers by statesmen irreconcilably at\r\nvariance with one another, alike in principle and object. The majority\r\nof thirty-nine was very large for those days, and it was decisive.\r\nThough the parliament was little more than a couple of years old, yet in\r\nface of the desperate confusion among leaders, parties, and groups, and\r\nupon the plea that reform had not been formally submitted as an issue to\r\nthe country, Lord Derby felt justified in dissolving. Mr. Gladstone held\r\nthe Oxford seat without opposition. The constituencies displayed an\r\nextension of the same essentially conservative feeling that had given\r\nLord Palmerston the victory two years before. Once more the real\r\nquestion lay not so much between measures as men; not so much between\r\ndemocratic change and conservative moderation, as between Palmerston and\r\nRussell on the one hand, and Derby and Disraeli on the other. The\r\ngovernment at the election improved their position by some thirty votes.\r\nThis was not enough to outnumber the phalanx of their various opponents\r\ncombined, but was it possible that the phalanx should combine? Mr.\r\nGladstone, who spoke of the dissolution as being a most improper as well\r\nas a most important measure, alike in domestic and in foreign bearings,\r\ntold Acland that he would not be surprised if the government were to\r\nattempt some reconstruction on a broad basis before the new parliament\r\nmet. This course was not adopted.\r\n\r\n                          CRITICAL MOMENTS\r\n\r\nThe chances of turning out the government were matters of infinite\r\ncomputation among the leaders. The liberal whip after the election gave\r\nhis own party a majority of fifteen, but the treasury whip, on the other\r\nhand, was equally confident of a majority of ten. Still all was\r\nadmittedly uncertain. The prime perplexity was whether if a new\r\nadministration could be formed, Lord Palmerston or Lord John should be\r\nat its head. Everybody agreed that it would be both impossible and wrong\r\nto depose the tories until it was certain that the liberals were united\r\nenough to mount into their seat, and no government could last unless it\r\ncomprehended both the old prime ministers. Could not one of them carry\r\nthe prize of the premiership into the Lords, and leave to the other the\r\nconsolation stake of leadership in the Commons? Lord Palmerston, who\r\ntook the crisis with a veteran's good-humoured coolness, told his\r\nintimates that he at any rate would not go up to the Lords, for he could\r\nnot trust John Russell in the other House. With a view, however, to\r\nministerial efficiency, he was anxious to keep Russell in the Commons,\r\nas with him and Gladstone they would make a strong treasury bench. But\r\nwas it certain that Gladstone would join? On this there was endless\r\ngossip. One story ran that Mrs. Gladstone had told somebody that her\r\nhusband wished bygones to be bygones, was all for a strong government,\r\nand was ready to join in forming one. Then the personage to whom this\r\nwas said upset the inference by declaring there was nothing in the\r\nconversation incompatible with a Derby junction. Sir Charles Wood says\r\nin his journal:--\r\n\r\n     _May 22._--Saw Mrs. Gladstone, who did not seem to contemplate a\r\n     junction with Palmerston but rather that he should join Derby. I\r\n     stated the impossibility of that, and that the strongest government\r\n     possible under present circumstances would be by such a union as\r\n     took place under Aberdeen. To effect this, all people must pull the\r\n     same and not different ways as of late years. I said that I blamed\r\n     her husband for quitting, and ever since he quitted, Palmerston's\r\n     government in 1855, as well as Lord John; that in the quarrel\r\n     between Lord John and Gladstone the former had behaved ill, and the\r\n     latter well.\r\n\r\n     _May 27._--Gladstone dined here.... He would vote a condemnation of\r\n     the dissolution, and is afraid of the foreign affairs at so\r\n     critical a moment being left in the hands of Malmesbury; says that\r\n     we, the opposition, are not only justified but called upon by the\r\n     challenge in the Queen's speech on the dissolution, to test the\r\n     strength of parties; but that he is himself in a different\r\n     position, that he would vote a condemnation of the dissolution, but\r\n     hesitates as to no confidence.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Phillimore[387] gives us other glimpses during this month:--\r\n\r\n     _May 18._--Long interview with Gladstone. He entered most fully and\r\n     without any reserve into his views on the state of political\r\n     parties and on the duties of a statesman at this juncture. Thought\r\n     the only chance of a strong government was an engrafting of\r\n     Palmerston upon Lord Derby, dethroning Disraeli from the leadership\r\n     of the House of Commons, arranging for a moderate Reform bill,\r\n     placing the foreign office in other hands, but not in Disraeli's.\r\n     He dwelt much upon this. Foreign politics seemed to have the chief\r\n     place in his mind.\r\n\r\n     _May 31._--Gladstone has seen Palmerston, and said he will not vote\r\n     against Lord Derby in support of Lord John's supposed motion. The\r\n     government Gladstone thinks desirable is a fusion of Palmerston and\r\n     his followers with Lord Derby, which implies, of course, weeding\r\n     out half at least of the present cabinet. Gladstone will have to\r\n     vote with government and speak against the cabinet, and violently\r\n     he will be abused.\r\n\r\n     _June 1._--Dined with Gladstone. He is much harassed and distressed\r\n     at his position relative to the government and opposition. Spoke\r\n     strongly against Lord Malmesbury. Said if the proposal is to\r\n     censure the dissolution, he must agree with it, but he will vote\r\n     against a want of confidence.\r\n\r\nOne important personage was quite confident that Gladstone would vote\r\nthe government out. Another thought that he would be sure to join a\r\nliberal administration. Palmerston believed this too, even though he\r\nmight not vote for a motion of want of confidence. Clarendon expected\r\nGladstone to join, though he would rather see him at the foreign office\r\nthan at the exchequer. At a dinner party at Lord Carlisle's where\r\nPalmerston, Lord John, Granville, Clarendon, Lewis, Argyll, and Delane\r\nwere present, Sir Charles Wood in a conversation with Mrs. Gladstone\r\nfound her much less inclined to keep the Derby government in. In the\r\nlast week of May a party feast was planned by Lord Palmerston and the\r\nwhip, but Lord John Russell declined to join the dinner. It was decided\r\nto call a meeting of the party. A confidential visitor was talking of it\r\nat Cambridge House, when the brougham came to the door to take\r\nPalmerston down to Pembroke Lodge. He was going, he said, to ask Lord\r\nJohn what they should say if they were asked at the meeting whether they\r\nhad come to an agreement. The interview was not unsatisfactory. Four\r\ndays later (June 6) a well-attended meeting of the party was held at\r\nWillis's Rooms. The two protagonists declared themselves ready to aid in\r\nforming a government on a broad basis, and it was understood that either\r\nwould serve under the other. It would be for the sovereign to decide.\r\nMr. Bright spoke in what the whigs pronounced to be a highly reasonable\r\nvein, and they all broke up in great spirits. The whip pored over his\r\nlists, and made out that they could not beat the government by less than\r\nseven. This was but a slender margin for a vote of no confidence, but it\r\nwas felt that mere numbers, though a majority might be an indispensable\r\nincident, were in this case not the only test of the conditions required\r\nfor a solid government. Lord Hartington, the representative of the great\r\nhouse of Cavendish, was put up to move a vote of no confidence.[388]\r\n\r\n                    FALL OF THE DERBY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAfter three days' debate, ministers were defeated (June 11) by the\r\nnarrow figure of thirteen in a House of six hundred and thirty-seven.\r\nMr. Gladstone did not speak, but he answered the riddle that had for\r\nlong so much harassed the wirepullers, by going into the lobby with\r\nDisraeli and his flock. The general sense of the majority was probably\r\nbest expressed by Mr. Bright. Since the fall of the government of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, he said, there had been no good handling of the liberal\r\nparty in the House: the cabinet had been exclusive, the policy had been\r\nsometimes wholly wrong, and generally feeble and paltering: if in the\r\nnew government there should be found men adequately representing these\r\nreconciled sections, acting with some measure of boldness and power,\r\ngrappling with the abuses that were admitted to exist, and relying upon\r\nthe moral sense and honest feeling of the House, and the general\r\nsympathy of the people of England for improvement in our legislation, he\r\nwas bold to hope that the new government would have a longer tenure of\r\noffice than any government that had existed for many years past.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, in the embarrassment of a choice between the two whig\r\nveterans, induced Lord Granville, whose cabinet life as yet was only\r\nsome five years, to try to form a government. This step Palmerston\r\nexplained by her German sympathies, which made her adverse alike to Lord\r\nJohn and himself. Lord Granville first applied to Palmerston, who said\r\nthat the Queen ought to have sent for himself first; still he agreed to\r\nserve. Lord John would only serve under Granville on condition of being\r\nleader in the House of Commons; if he joined--so he argued--and if\r\nPalmerston were leader in the Commons, this would make himself third\r\ninstead of second: on that point his answer was final. So Lord Granville\r\nthrew up a commission that never had life in it; the Queen handed the\r\ntask over to Palmerston, and in a few days the new administration was\r\ninstalled. (June 17, 1859.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone went back to the office that he had quitted four years and\r\na half before, and undertook the department of finance. The appointment\r\ndid not pass without considerable remark. 'The real scandal,' he wrote\r\nto his Oxford chairman, 'is among the extreme men on the liberal side;\r\nthey naturally say, \"This man has done all he could on behalf of Lord\r\nDerby; why is he here to keep out one of us?\"' Even some among Mr.\r\nGladstone's private friends wondered how he could bring himself to join\r\na minister of whom he had for three or four years used such unsparing\r\nlanguage as had been common on his lips about Lord Palmerston. The plain\r\nman was puzzled by a vote in favour of keeping a tory government in,\r\nfollowed by a junction with the men who had thrown that government out.\r\nCobden, as we know, declined to join.[389] 'I am exceedingly sorry,'\r\nwrote Mr. Gladstone to his brother Robertson (July 2), 'to find that\r\nCobden does not take office. It was in his person that there seemed to\r\nbe the best chance of a favourable trial of the experiment of connecting\r\nhis friends with the practical administration of the government of this\r\ncountry. I am very glad we have Gibson; but Cobden would, especially as\r\nan addition to the former, have made a great difference in point of\r\nweight.'[390]\r\n\r\n                       AGAIN AT THE EXCHEQUER\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, with no special anxiety to defend himself, was clear\r\nabout his own course. 'Never,' he says, 'had I an easier question to\r\ndetermine than when I was asked to join the government. I can hardly now\r\nthink how I could have looked any one in the face, had I refused my aid\r\n(such as it is) at such a time and under such circumstances.' 'At a\r\nmoment,' he wrote to the warden of All Souls, 'when war is raging in\r\nEurope, when the English government is the only instrument through which\r\nthere is any hope, humanly speaking, of any safe and early settlement,\r\nand when all parties agree that the government of the Queen ought to be\r\nstrengthened, I have joined the only administration that could be\r\nformed, in concert with all the friends (setting aside those whom age\r\nexcludes) with whom I joined and acted in the government of Lord\r\nAberdeen.'\r\n\r\nTo the provost of Oriel he addressed a rather elaborate\r\nexplanation,[391] but it only expands what he says more briefly in a\r\nletter (June 16) to Sir William Heathcote, an excellent and honourable\r\nman, his colleague in the representation of Oxford:--\r\n\r\n     I am so little sensible of having had any very doubtful point to\r\n     consider, that I feel confident that, given the antecedents of the\r\n     problem as they clearly stood before me, you would have decided in\r\n     the way that I have done. For thirteen years, the middle space of\r\n     life, I have been cast out of party connection, severed from my old\r\n     party, and loath irrecoverably to join a new one. So long have I\r\n     adhered to the vague hope of a reconstruction, that I have been\r\n     left alone by every political friend in association with whom I had\r\n     grown up. My votes too, and such support as I could give, have\r\n     practically been given to Lord Derby's government, in such a manner\r\n     as undoubtedly to divest me of all claims whatever on the liberal\r\n     party and the incoming government. Under these circumstances I am\r\n     asked to take office. The two leading points which must determine\r\n     immediate action are those of reform and foreign policy. On the\r\n     first I think that Lord Derby had by dissolution lost all chance of\r\n     settling it; and, as I desire to see it settled, it seems my duty\r\n     to assist those who perhaps may settle it. Upon the second I am in\r\n     real and close harmony of sentiment with the new premier, and the\r\n     new foreign secretary. How could I, under these circumstances, say,\r\n     I will have nothing to do with you, and be the one remaining\r\n     Ishmael in the House of Commons?\r\n\r\nWriting to Sir John Acton in 1864, Mr. Gladstone said:--\r\n\r\n     When I took my present office in 1859, I had several negative and\r\n     several positive reasons for accepting it. Of the first, there were\r\n     these. There had been differences and collisions, but there were no\r\n     resentments. I felt myself to be mischievous in an isolated\r\n     position, outside the regular party organisation of parliament. And\r\n     I was aware of no differences of opinion or tendency likely to\r\n     disturb the new government. Then on the positive side. I felt sure\r\n     that in finance there was still much useful work to be done. I was\r\n     desirous to co-operate in settling the question of the franchise,\r\n     and failed to anticipate the disaster that it was to undergo. My\r\n     friends were enlisted, or I knew would enlist: Sir James Graham\r\n     indeed declining office, but taking his position in the party. And\r\n     the overwhelming interest and weight of the Italian question, and\r\n     of our foreign policy in connection with it, joined to my entire\r\n     mistrust of the former government in relation to it, led me to\r\n     decide without one moment's hesitation....\r\n\r\n                          CONTEST AT OXFORD\r\n\r\nOn the day on which Mr. Gladstone kissed hands (June 18) disturbing news\r\ncame from Oxford. Not only was his re-election to be opposed, but the\r\nenemy had secured the most formidable candidate that he had yet\r\nencountered, in the person of Lord Chandos, the eldest son of the Duke\r\nof Buckingham. His old chairman became chairman for his new antagonist,\r\nand Stafford Northcote, who with Phillimore and Bernard had hitherto\r\nfought every election on his behalf, now refused to serve on his\r\ncommittee, while even Sir John Coleridge was alarmed at some reported\r\nwavering on the question of a deceased wife's sister. 'Gladstone,\r\nangry, harassed, sore,' Phillimore records, 'as well he might be.' The\r\nprovost of Oriel explains to him that men asked whether his very last\r\nvote had not been a vote of confidence in a Derby government, and of\r\nwant of confidence in a Palmerston government, yet he had joined the\r\ngovernment in which he declared by anticipation that he had no\r\nconfidence. After all, the root of the anger against him was simply that\r\nthe tories were out and the liberals in, with himself as their strongest\r\nconfederate. A question was raised whether he ought not to go down and\r\naddress convocation in person. The dean of Christ Church, however,\r\nthought it very doubtful whether he would get a hearing. 'Those,' he\r\ntold Mr. Gladstone, 'who remember Sir Robert Peel's election testify\r\nthat there never was a more unreasonable and ferocious mob than\r\nconvocation was at that time. If you were heard, it is doubtful whether\r\nyou would gain any votes at that last moment, while it is believed you\r\nwould lose some. You would be questioned as to the ecclesiastical policy\r\nof the cabinet. Either you would not be able to answer fully, or you\r\nwould answer in such terms as to alienate one or other of the two\r\nnumerous classes who will now give you many votes.'\r\n\r\nThe usual waterspout began to pour. The newspapers asserted that Mr.\r\nGladstone meant to cut down naval estimates, and this moved the country\r\nclergy to angry apprehension that he was for peace at any price. The\r\ncandidate was obliged to spend thankless hours on letters to reassure\r\nthem. 'The two assertions of fact respecting me are wholly unfounded. I\r\nmean these two:--1. That as chancellor of the exchequer I \"starved\" the\r\nCrimean war: that is to say limited the expenditure upon it. There is\r\nnot a shadow of truth in this statement. 2. That as soon as the war was\r\nover I caused the government to reduce their estimates, diminish the\r\narmy, disband two fleets, and break faith with our seamen. When the war\r\nwas over, that is in the year 1856, I did not take objection at all to\r\nthe establishment or expenditure of the year. In the next year, 1857, I\r\nconsidered that they ought to have been further reduced: but neither a\r\nman nor a shilling was taken from them in consequence of my\r\nendeavours.' Other correspondents were uneasy about his soundness on\r\nrifle corps and rifle clubs. 'How,' he replied, 'can any uncertainty\r\nexist as to the intentions in regard to defence in a government with\r\nLord Palmerston at its head?' He was warned that Cobden, Bright, and\r\nGibson were odious in Oxford, and he was suspected of being their\r\naccomplice. The clamour against Puseyism had died down, and the\r\nhostility of the evangelicals was no longer keen; otherwise it was the\r\nold story. Goldwin Smith tells him, 'Win or lose, you will have the vote\r\nof every one of heart and brain in the university and really connected\r\nwith it. Young Oxford is all with you. Every year more men obtain the\r\nreward of their industry through your legislation. But old Oxford takes\r\na long time in dying.' In the end (July 1), he won the battle by a\r\nmajority of 191--Gladstone, 1050, Chandos, 859.\r\n\r\n'My conscience is light and clear,' he wrote to Heathcote in the course\r\nof the contest. 'The interests that have weighed with me are in some\r\ndegree peculiar, and I daresay it is a fault in me, especially as member\r\nfor Oxford, that I cannot merge the man in the representative. While\r\nthey have had much reason to complain, I have not had an over-good\r\nbargain. In the estimate of mere pleasure and pain, the representation\r\nof the university is not worth my having; for though the account is long\r\non both sides, the latter is the heavier, and sharper. In the true\r\nestimates of good and evil, I can look back upon the last twelve years\r\nwith some satisfaction, first, because I feel that as far as I am\r\ncapable of labouring for anything, I have laboured for Oxford; and\r\nsecondly, because in this respect at least I have been happy, that the\r\ntimes afforded me in various ways a field. And even as to the\r\ncontemptible summing up between suffering and enjoyment, my belief is\r\nthat the latter will endure, while the former will pass away.' The\r\nbalance struck in this last sentence is a characteristic fragment of Mr.\r\nGladstone's philosophy of public life. It lightened and dispelled the\r\ninevitable hours of disappointment and chagrin that, in natures of less\r\nlofty fortitude than his, are apt to slacken the nerve and rust the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                 PARTY SEVERANCE, NOT CHANGED PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nIt seems a mistake to treat the acceptance of office under Lord\r\nPalmerston as a chief landmark in Mr. Gladstone's protracted journey\r\nfrom tory to liberal. The dilemma between joining Derby and joining\r\nPalmerston was no vital choice between two political creeds. The new\r\nprime minister and his chancellor of the exchequer had both of them\r\nstarted with Canning for their common master; but there was a generation\r\nbetween them, and Mr. Gladstone had travelled along a road of his own,\r\nperhaps not even now perceiving its goal. As we have seen, he told Mr.\r\nWalpole in May 1858 (p. 584), that there were 'no broad and palpable\r\ndifferences of opinion on public questions of principle,' that separated\r\nhimself from the Derbyite tories.[392] Palmerston on the other hand was\r\nso much of a Derbyite tory, that his government, which Mr. Gladstone was\r\nnow entering, owed its long spell of office and power to the countenance\r\nof Derby and his men. Mr. Bright had contemplated (p. 579) the\r\npossibility of a reverse process--a Derbyite government favoured by\r\nPalmerston's men. In either case, the political identity of the two\r\nleaders was recognised. To join the new administration, then, marked a\r\nparty severance but no changed principles. I am far from denying the\r\nenormous significance of the party wrench, but it was not a conversion.\r\nMr. Gladstone was at this time in his politics a liberal reformer of\r\nTurgot's type, a born lover of good government, of just practical laws,\r\nof wise improvement, of public business well handled, of a state that\r\nshould emancipate and serve the individual. The necessity of summoning\r\nnew driving force, and amending the machinery of the constitution, had\r\nnot yet disclosed itself to him. This was soon discovered by events.\r\nMeanwhile he may well have thought that he saw as good a chance of great\r\nwork with Palmerston as with Disraeli; or far better, for the election\r\nhad shown that Bright was not wrong when he warned him that a Derby\r\ngovernment could only exist upon forbearance.\r\n\r\nBright's own words already referred to (p. 625) sufficiently describe\r\nMr. Gladstone's point of view; the need for a ministry with men in it\r\n'acting with some measure of boldness and power, grappling with abuses,\r\nand relying upon the moral sense and honest feeling of the House, and\r\nthe general sympathy of the people of England for improvement.' With\r\nsuch purposes an alliance with liberals of Lord Palmerston's temper\r\nimplied no wonderful dislodgment. The really great dislodgment in his\r\nlife had occurred long before. It was the fates that befell his book, it\r\nwas the Maynooth grant, and the Gorham case, that swept away the\r\nfoundations on which he had first built. In writing to Manning in 1845\r\n(April 25) after his retirement on the question of Maynooth, Mr.\r\nGladstone says to him, 'Newman sent me a letter giving his own\r\nexplanation of my position. It was admirably done.' Newman in his letter\r\ntold him that various persons had asked how he understood Mr.\r\nGladstone's present position, so he put down what he conceived it to be,\r\nand he expresses the great interest that he feels in the tone of thought\r\nthen engaging the statesman's mind:--\r\n\r\n                            LETTER FROM NEWMAN\r\n\r\n     I say then [writes Newman, addressing an imaginary interlocutor]:\r\n     'Mr. Gladstone has said the state _ought_ to have a conscience, but\r\n     it has not a conscience. Can _he_ give it a conscience? Is he to\r\n     impose his own conscience on the state? He would be very glad to do\r\n     so, if it thereby would become the state's conscience. But that is\r\n     absurd. He must deal with facts. It has a thousand consciences, as\r\n     being in its legislative and executive capacities the aggregate of\r\n     a hundred minds; that is, it has no conscience.\r\n\r\n     'You will say, \"Well the obvious thing would be, if the state has\r\n     not a conscience, that he shall cease to be answerable for it.\" So\r\n     he has--he has retired from the ministry. While he thought he could\r\n     believe it had a conscience--till he was forced to give up, what it\r\n     was his duty to cherish as long as ever he could, the notion that\r\n     the British empire was a subject and servant of the kingdom of\r\n     Christ--he served the state. Now that he finds this to be a mere\r\n     dream, much as it ought to be otherwise, and as it once was\r\n     otherwise, he has said, I cannot serve such a mistress.\r\n\r\n     'But really,' I continue, 'do you in your heart mean to say that he\r\n     should absolutely and for ever give up the state and country? I\r\n     hope not. I do not think he has so committed himself. That the\r\n     conclusion he has come to is a very grave one, and not consistent\r\n     with his going on blindly in the din and hurry of business, without\r\n     having principles to guide him, I admit; and this, I conceive, is\r\n     his reason for at once retiring from the ministry, that he may\r\n     contemplate the state of things calmly and from without. But I\r\n     really cannot pronounce, nor can you, nor can he perhaps at once,\r\n     what is a Christian's duty under these new circumstances, whether\r\n     to remain in retirement from public affairs or not. Retirement,\r\n     however, could not be done by halves. If he is absolutely to give\r\n     up all management of public affairs, he must retire not only from\r\n     the ministry but from parliament.\r\n\r\n     'I see another reason for his retiring from the ministry. The\r\n     public thought they had in his book a pledge that the government\r\n     would not take such a step with regard to Maynooth as is now before\r\n     the country. Had he continued in the ministry he would to a certain\r\n     extent have been misleading the country.\r\n\r\n     'You say, \"He made some show of seeing his way in future, for he\r\n     gave advice; he said it would be well for all parties to yield\r\n     something. To see his way and to give advice is as if he had found\r\n     some principle to go on.\" I do not so understand him. I thought he\r\n     distinctly stated he had not yet found a principle. But he gave\r\n     that advice which facts, or what he called circumstances, made\r\n     necessary, and which if followed out, will, it is to be hoped, lead\r\n     to some basis of principle which we do not see at present.'\r\n\r\nCompared to the supreme case of conscience indicated here, and it\r\nhaunted Mr. Gladstone for nearly all his life, the perplexities of party\r\ncould be but secondary. Those perplexities were never sharper than in\r\nthe four years from 1854 to 1859; and with his living sense of\r\nresponsibility for the right use of transcendent powers of national\r\nservice, it was practically inevitable that he should at last quit the\r\nbarren position of 'the one remaining Ishmael in the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nLater in this year Mr. Gladstone was chosen to be the first lord rector\r\nof the university of Edinburgh under powers conferred by a recent law.\r\nHis unsuccessful rival was Lord Neaves, excellent as lawyer, humorist,\r\nand scholar. In April the following year, in the midst of the most\r\ntrying session of his life, he went down from the battle-ground at\r\nWestminster, and delivered his rectorial address[393]--not particularly\r\npregnant, original, or pithy, but marked by incomparable buoyancy;\r\nenforcing a conception of the proper functions of a university that can\r\nnever be enforced too strongly or too often; and impressing in melodious\r\nperiod and glowing image those ever needed commonplaces about thrift of\r\ntime and thirst for fame and the glory of knowledge, that kindle sacred\r\nfire in young hearts. It was his own career, intellectual as well as\r\npolitical, that gave to his discourse momentum. It was his own example\r\nthat to youthful hearers gave new depth to a trite lesson, when he\r\nexclaimed: 'Believe me when I tell you that the thrift of time will\r\nrepay you in after life with an usury of profit beyond your most\r\nsanguine dreams, and that the waste of it will make you dwindle, alike\r\nin intellectual and in moral stature, beneath your darkest reckonings.'\r\nSo too, we who have it all before us know that it was a maxim of his own\r\ninner life, when he told them: 'The thirst for an enduring fame is near\r\nakin to the love of true excellence; but the fame of the moment is a\r\ndangerous possession and a bastard motive; and he who does his acts in\r\norder that the echo of them may come back as a soft music in his ears,\r\nplays false to his noble destiny as a Christian man, places himself in\r\ncontinual danger of dallying with wrong, and taints even his virtuous\r\nactions at their source.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[387] Not, however, Sir Robert until 1862, when he was knighted on\r\nbecoming Queen's advocate. He was created baronet in 1881.\r\n\r\n[388] Lord Hartington's motion was--'That it is essential for the\r\nsatisfactory result of our deliberations, and for facilitating the\r\ndischarge of your Majesty's high functions, that your Majesty's\r\ngovernment should possess the confidence of this House and of the\r\ncountry; and we deem it our duty respectfully to submit to your Majesty\r\nthat such confidence is not reposed in the present advisers of your\r\nMajesty.'\r\n\r\n[389] _Life of Cobden_, ii. pp. 229-233.\r\n\r\n[390] There is a strange story in the _Halifax Papers_ of Bright at this\r\ntime visiting Lord Aberdeen, and displaying much ill humour. 'He cannot\r\nreconcile himself to not being considered capable of taking office. Lord\r\nJohn broached a scheme for sending him as governor-general to Canada. I\r\nrather doubted the expediency of this, but Mr. Gladstone seemed to think\r\nit not a bad scheme' (June 15, 1859). Many curious things sprang up in\r\nmen's minds at that moment.\r\n\r\n[391] Reproduced in Mr. Russell's book on Mr. Gladstone, pp. 144-5.\r\n\r\n[392] It is worth noticing that he sat on the ministerial side of the\r\nHouse without breach of continuity from 1853 to 1866. During the first\r\nDerby government, as we have already seen (p. 423), he sat below the\r\ngangway on the opposition side; during the Palmerston administration of\r\n1855 he sat below the gangway on the government side; and he remained\r\nthere after the second Derby accession to office in 1858.\r\n\r\n[393] The Address is in _Gleanings_, vii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                             CHOICE OF PROFESSION\r\n\r\n                                 _Page 82_\r\n\r\n                        _Mr. Gladstone to his Father_\r\n\r\n_Cuddesdon, Aug. 4, 1830._--MY BELOVED FATHER,--I have a good while\r\nrefrained from addressing you on a subject of importance and much\r\naffecting my own future destiny, from a supposition that your time and\r\nthoughts have been much occupied for several months past by other\r\nmatters of great interest in succession. Now, however, believing you to\r\nbe more at leisure, I venture to bring it before you. It is, as you will\r\nhave anticipated, the decision of the profession to which I am to look\r\nforward for life. Above eighteen months have now passed since you spoke\r\nto me of it at Seaforth, and most kindly desired me, if unable then to\r\nmake up my mind to go into the law, to take some time to consider calmly\r\nof the whole question.\r\n\r\nIt would have been undutiful to trouble you with a recurrence of it,\r\nuntil such a period had been suffered to elapse, as would suffice to\r\nafford, by the effects it should itself produce, some fair criterion and\r\npresumption of the inclination which my mind was likely to adopt in\r\nreference to the _final_ decision. At the same time it would also have\r\nbeen undutiful, and most repugnant to my feelings, to permit the\r\nprolongation of that intervening period to such an extent, as to give\r\nthe shadow of a reason to suppose that anything approaching to reserve\r\nhad been the cause of my silence. The present time seems to lie between\r\nthese two extremes, and therefore to render it incumbent on me to\r\napprise you of the state of my own views.\r\n\r\nI trust it is hardly necessary to specify my knowledge that when I speak\r\nof 'the state of my own views' on this question, I do so not of right\r\nbut by sufferance, by invitation from you, by that more than parental\r\nkindness and indulgence with which I have ever met at my parents' hands,\r\nwhich it would be as absurd to make a matter of _formal_ acknowledgment\r\nas it would be impossible to repay, and for which I can only say, and I\r\nsay it from the bottom of my heart, may God reward them with his best\r\nand choicest gifts, eternal, unfading in the heavens.\r\n\r\nIf then I am to advert to the disposition of my own mind as regards\r\nthis matter, I cannot avoid perceiving that it has inclined to the\r\nministerial office, for what has now become a considerable period, with\r\na bias at first uncertain and intermittent, but which has regularly and\r\nrapidly increased in force and permanence. It has not been owing as far\r\nas I can myself discern, to the operation of any external cause\r\nwhatever; nor of internal ones to any others than those which work their\r\neffects in the most gradual and imperceptible manner. Day after day it\r\nhas grown upon and into my habit of feeling and desire. It has been\r\ngradually strengthened by those small accessions of power, each of which\r\nsingly it would be utterly impossible to trace, but which collectively\r\nhave not only produced a desire of a certain description, but have led\r\nme by reasonings often weighed and sifted and re-sifted to the best of\r\nmy ability, to the deliberate conclusion which I have stated above. I do\r\nnot indeed mean to say that there has been _no_ time within this period\r\nat which I have felt a longing for other pursuits; but such feelings\r\nhave been unstable and temporary; that which I now speak of is the\r\npermanent and habitual inclination of my mind. And such too, I think, it\r\nis likely to continue; as far at least as I can venture to think I see\r\nanything belonging to the future, or can anticipate the continuance of\r\nany one desire, feeling, or principle, in a mind so wayward and\r\nuncertain as my own--so far do I believe that this sentiment will\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pain, great pain, to communicate anything which I have even\r\nthe remotest apprehension can give the slightest annoyance to you. I\r\ntrust this will not do so; although I fear it may. But though fearing it\r\nmay, I feel it is my duty to do it: because I have only these three\r\nalternatives before me. First, to delay communication to some subsequent\r\nopportunity: but as I have no fair prospect of being able _then_ to\r\nconvey a different statement, this plan would be attended with no\r\nadvantage whatever, as far as I can see. Secondly, to dissemble my\r\nfeelings: an alternative on which if I said another word I should be\r\nbehaving undutifully and wickedly towards you. Thirdly, to follow the\r\ncourse I have now chosen, I trust with no feelings but those of the most\r\nprofound affection, and of unfeigned grief that as far as my own view is\r\nconcerned, I am unable to make it coincide with yours. I say, _as far_\r\nas my own view goes, because I do not now see that my own view can or\r\nought to stand for a moment in the way of your desires. In the hands of\r\nmy parents, therefore, I am left. But lest you should be led to suppose\r\nthat I have never reasoned with myself on this matter, but yielded to\r\nblind impulses or transitory whims, I will state, not indeed at length,\r\nbut with as much simplicity and clearness as I am able, some of the\r\nmotives which seem to me to urge me with an irresistible accumulation of\r\nmoral force, to this conclusion, and this alone. In the first place, I\r\nwould say that my own state and character is _not_ one of them; nor, I\r\nbelieve, could any views of that character be compatible with their\r\nexistence and reception, but that in which it now appears to me: namely,\r\nas one on which I can look with no degree of satisfaction whatever, and\r\nfor the purification of which I can only direct my eyes and offer up my\r\nprayers to the throne of God.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, with reference to the _dignity_ of this office, I know none\r\nto compare with it; none which can compete with the grandeur of its end\r\nor of its means--the end, the glory of God, and the means, the\r\nrestoration of man to that image of his Maker which is now throughout\r\nthe world so lamentably defaced. True indeed it is, that there are other\r\nfields for the use and improvement of all which God lends to us, which\r\nare wide, dignified, beneficial, desirable: desirable in the first and\r\nhighest degree, _if we had not this_. But as long as this field\r\ncontinues, and as long as it continues unfilled, I do not see how I am\r\nto persuade myself that any powers, be they the meanest or the greatest,\r\ncan be _so_ profitably or _so_ nobly employed as in the performance of\r\nthis sublime duty. And that this field is _not_ yet filled, how can any\r\none doubt who casts his eyes abroad over the moral wilderness of this\r\nworld, who contemplates the pursuits, desires, designs, and principles\r\nof the beings that move so busily in it to and fro, without an object\r\nbeyond the finding food, be it mental or bodily, for the _present_\r\nmoment or the _present_ life--it matters little which--or beyond\r\nministering to the desires, under whatever modification they may appear,\r\nof self-will and self-love? When I look to the standard of habit and\r\nprinciple adopted in the world at large, and then divert my eyes for a\r\nmoment from that spectacle to the standard fixed and the picture\r\ndelineated in the book of revelation, then, my beloved father, the\r\nconviction flashes on my soul with a moral force I cannot resist, and\r\nwould not if I could, that the vineyard still wants labourers, that 'the\r\nkingdoms of this world are not yet become the kingdoms of our Lord and\r\nof his Christ,' and that _till_ they are become such, till the frail\r\nrace of Adam is restored to the knowledge and the likeness of his Maker,\r\ntill universally and throughout the wide world the will of God is become\r\nour delight, and its accomplishment our first and last desire, there can\r\nbe no claim so solemn and imperative as that which even now seems to\r\ncall to us with the voice of God from heaven, and to say 'I have given\r\nMine own Son for this rebellious and apostate world, the sacrifice is\r\noffered and accepted, but you, you who are basking in the sunbeams of\r\nChristianity, you who are blessed beyond measure, and, oh, how beyond\r\ndesert in parents, in friends, in every circumstance and adjunct that\r\ncan sweeten your pilgrimage, why will you not bear to fellow-creatures\r\nsitting in darkness and the shadow of death the tidings of this\r\nuniversal and incomprehensible love?'\r\n\r\nIn this, I believe, is included the main reason which influences me; a\r\nreason as full of joy as of glory: that transcendent reason, in\r\ncomparison with which every other object seems to dwindle into utter and\r\nabsolute insignificance. But I would not conceal from you--why should\r\nI?--that which I cannot conceal from myself: that the darker side of\r\nthis great picture sometimes meets me, and it is vain that, shuddering,\r\nI attempt to turn away from it. My mind involuntarily reverts to the sad\r\nand solemn conviction that a fearfully great portion of the world round\r\nme is dying in sin. This conviction is the result of that same\r\ncomparison I have mentioned before, between the principles and practices\r\nit embraces, and those which the Almighty authoritatively enjoins: and\r\n_entertaining it_ as I do, how, my beloved parent, can I bear to think\r\nof my own seeking to wanton in the pleasures of life (I mean even its\r\ninnocent pleasures), or to give up my heart to its business, while my\r\nfellow-creatures, to whom I am bound by every tie of human sympathies,\r\nof a common sinfulness and a common redemption, day after day are\r\nsinking into death? I mean, not the death of the body, which is but a\r\ngate either to happiness or to misery, but that of the soul, the true\r\nand the only true death. Can I, with this persuasion engrossing me, be\r\njustified in inactivity? or in any measure short of the most direct and\r\nmost effective means of meeting, if in _any degree_ it be possible,\r\nthese horrible calamities? Nor is impotency and incompetency any\r\nargument on the other side: if I saw a man drowning I should hold out my\r\nhand to help him, although I were uncertain whether my strength would\r\nprove sufficient to extricate him or not; how much more strongly, then,\r\nis this duty incumbent when there are thousands on thousands perishing\r\nin sin and ignorance on every side, and where the stake is not the\r\naddition or subtraction of a few short years from a life, which can but\r\nbe a span, longer or shorter, but the doom, the irrevocable doom of\r\nspirits made for God, and once like God, but now alienated and apostate?\r\nAnd the remedy which God has provided for this portentous evil is not\r\nlike the ponderous and elaborate contrivances of men; its spear is not,\r\nlike Goliath's, the weaver's beam, but all its weapons are a few pure\r\nand simple elements of truth, ill calculated, like the arms of David, in\r\nthe estimation of the world to attain their object, but yet capable of\r\nbeing wielded by a stripling's hand, and yet more, 'mighty, through God,\r\nto the pulling down of strongholds.'\r\n\r\nWhat I have said is from the bottom of my heart, and put forward without\r\nthe smallest reservation of any kind: and I have said it thus, because\r\nin duty bound to do it; and having, too, the comfort of the fullest\r\npersuasion that even if your judgment should disallow it, your affection\r\nwould pardon it. It is possible, indeed, that the (as it seems to me)\r\nawful consideration which I have last put forward may have been\r\nmisstated or misapprehended. Would God it may be so! happy should I be\r\nto find either by reason or revelation that the principles of this world\r\nwere other than I have estimated them to be, and consequently that their\r\nfate would be other likewise. I may be under darkness and delusion,\r\nhaving consulted with none in this matter; but till it is shown that I\r\nam so, I am bound by all the most solemn ties, ties not created in this\r\nworld nor to be dissolved with it, but eternal and changeless as our\r\nspirits and He who made them, to regulate my actions with reference to\r\nthese all-important truths--the apostasy of man on the one hand, the\r\nlove of God on the other. Of my duties _to men_ as a social being, can\r\nany be so important as to tell them of the danger under which I believe\r\nthem to lie, of the precipice to which I fear many are approaching,\r\nwhile thousands have already fallen headlong, and others again, even\r\nwhile I write, are continuing to fall in a succession of appalling\r\nrapidity? Of my duties _to God_ as a rational and responsible being,\r\nespecially as a being for whom in common with all men the precious blood\r\nof Christ has been given, can any more imperatively and more\r\npersuasively demand all the little I can give than this, the proclaiming\r\nthat one instance of God's unfathomable love which alone so transcends\r\nas almost to swallow up all others? while those others thus transcended\r\nand eclipsed are such as would be of themselves by far the highest and\r\nholiest obligations man could know, did we not know this.\r\n\r\nThus I have endeavoured to state these truths, if truths they are, at\r\nleast these convictions, to you, dwelling upon them at a length which\r\nmay perhaps be tedious and appear affected, simply as I trust, in order\r\nto represent them to your mind as much to the life as possible, I mean\r\nas nearly as possible in the light in which they have again and again\r\nappeared, and do habitually appear, to my own, so as to give you the\r\nbest means in my power of estimating the strength or detecting the\r\nweakness of those grounds on which the conclusions above stated rest. (I\r\nhave not mentioned the benefit I might hope myself to derive from this\r\ncourse of living compared with others; and yet this consideration,\r\nthough here undoubtedly a secondary one, is, I believe, more weighty\r\nthan any of those which can be advanced in favour of an opposite\r\ndetermination.)\r\n\r\nFor some time I doubted whether to state reasons at all: fearing that it\r\nmight appear presumptuous; but I resolved to do it as choosing rather to\r\nincur that risk, than the hazarding an appearance of reserve and desire\r\nto conceal my real sentiments from one who has a right to see into the\r\nbottom of my heart.\r\n\r\nYet one trespass more I must make on your patience. It may perhaps seem\r\nthat the inducements I have stated are of an unusual character,\r\nunsubstantial, romantic, theoretical, and not practical. Unusual,\r\nindeed, they are: because (though it is not without diffidence that I\r\nbring this sweeping charge--indeed, I should not dare to bring it were\r\nit not brought elsewhere) it is a rare thing in this world even where\r\nright actions are performed to ground them upon right motives. At least,\r\nI am convinced that there are fundamental errors on this subject very\r\nprevalent--that they are in general fixed far too low, and that the\r\nheight of our standard of practice must ever be adapted more or less to\r\nthat of principle. God only knows whether this be right. But hence it\r\nhas been that I have endeavoured, I trust not improperly, to put these\r\nmotives forward in the simplicity of that form wherein they seem to me\r\nto come down from the throne of God to the hearts of men; and to\r\nconsider my prospects and obligations, not under all the limitations\r\nwhich a highly artificial state of society might seem to impose upon\r\nthem, but direct and undiluted; not, in short, as one who has certain\r\npursuits to follow, certain objects of his own to gain, and relations\r\nto fulfil, and arrangements to execute--but as a being destined shortly\r\nto stand before the judgment seat of God, and there give the decisive\r\naccount of his actions at the tribunal whose awards admit of no evasion\r\nand of no appeal.\r\n\r\nThat I _have_ viewed them in this light I dare not assert; but I have\r\nwished and striven to view them so, and to weigh them, and to answer\r\nthese questions in the same manner as I must answer them on that day\r\nwhen the trumpet of the archangel shall arouse the living and the dead,\r\nand when it will be demanded of me in common with all others, how I have\r\nkept and how employed that which was committed to my charge. I dare not\r\npretend that I could act even up to the standard here fixed, but I can\r\neye it though distant, with longing hope, and look upwards for the power\r\nwhich I know is all-sufficient, and therefore sufficient to enable even\r\nsuch an one as myself to reach it.\r\n\r\nViewing, then, these considerations in such a light as this, I can come\r\nto no other conclusion, at least unaided, than that the work of\r\nspreading religion has a claim infinitely transcending all others in\r\ndignity, in solemnity, and in usefulness: destined to continue in force\r\nuntil the happy moment come when every human being has been made fully\r\nand effectually acquainted with his condition and its remedies--when\r\ntoo, as it seems to me, it will be soon enough--of course, I lay down\r\nthis rule for myself, provided as I am to the extent of my wants and\r\nvery far beyond them--to devise other occupations: _now_ it behoves me\r\nto discharge the overwhelming obligation which summons me to this.\r\n\r\nI have scarcely mentioned my beloved mother in the whole of this letter;\r\nfor though little has ever passed between us on this subject through the\r\nmedium of language, and nothing whatever, I believe, since I last spoke\r\nwith you upon it, yet I have long been well aware of the tendency of her\r\ndesires, long indeed before my own in any degree coincided with them.\r\n\r\nI await with deference and interest the communication of your desires\r\nupon this subject: earnestly desiring that if I have said anything\r\nthrough pride or self-love, it may be forgiven me at your hands, and by\r\nGod through his Son; and that if my statements be false, or exaggerated,\r\nor romantic, or impracticable, I may, by His mercy and through your\r\ninstrumentality or that of others, be brought back to my right mind, and\r\ntaught to hold the truth of God in all its sobriety as well as in all\r\nits force.--And believe me ever, my beloved and honoured father, your\r\naffectionate and dutiful son,\r\n\r\n                                                  WM. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _John Gladstone to his Son_\r\n\r\n                                        _Leamington, 10 Aug. 1830_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED WILLIAM,--I have read and given my best consideration to your\r\nletter, dated the 4th, which I only received yesterday. I did hope that\r\nyou would have delayed making up your mind on a subject so important as\r\nyour future pursuits in life must be to yourself and to us all, until\r\nyou had completed those studies connected with the attainment of the\r\nhonours or distinctions of which you were so justly ambitious, and on\r\nwhich your mind seemed so bent when we last communicated respecting\r\nthem. You know my opinion to be, that the field for actual usefulness to\r\nour fellow-creatures, where a disposition to exercise it actively\r\nexists, is more circumscribed and limited in the occupations and duties\r\nof a clergyman, whose sphere of action, unless pluralities are admitted\r\n(as I am sure they would not be advocated by you) is necessarily in a\r\ngreat degree confined to his parish, than in those professions or\r\npursuits which lead to a more general knowledge, as well as a more\r\ngeneral intercourse with mankind, such as the law, taking it as a basis,\r\nand introduction to public life, to which I had looked forward for you,\r\nconsidering you, as I do, peculiarly well qualified to be made thus\r\neminently useful to others, with credit and satisfaction to yourself.\r\nThere is no doubt but as a clergyman, faithfully and conscientiously\r\ndischarging the duties of that office to those whose spiritual interests\r\nare entrusted to your care, should you eventually be placed in that\r\nsituation, that you may have both comfort and satisfaction, with few\r\nworldly responsibilities, but you will allow me to doubt whether the\r\npicture your perhaps too sanguine mind has drawn in your letter before\r\nme, would ever be practically realised. Be this as it may, whenever your\r\nmind shall be finally made up on this most important subject, I shall\r\ntrust to its being eventually for your good, whatever that determination\r\nmay be. In the meantime I am certainly desirous that those studies with\r\nwhich you have been occupied in reading for your degree may be followed\r\nup, whether the shorter or longer period may be necessary to prepare you\r\nfor the results. You are young and have ample time before you. Let\r\nnothing be done rashly; be consistent with yourself, and avail yourself\r\nof all the advantages placed within your reach. If, when that ordeal is\r\npassed, you should continue to think as you now do, I shall not oppose\r\nyour _then_ preparing yourself for the church, but I do hope that your\r\nfinal determination will not until then be taken, and that whatever\r\nevents may occur in the interval, you will give them such weight and\r\nconsideration as they may appear to merit.... Your mother is much as\r\nusual.--With our united and affectionate love, I ever am your\r\naffectionate father,\r\n\r\n                                                     JOHN GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CANADA, 1838\r\n\r\n                                _Page 144_\r\n\r\n_Jan. 20/38._--To-day there was a meeting on Canada at Sir R. Peel's.\r\nThere were present Duke of Wellington, Lords Aberdeen, Ripon,\r\nEllenborough, Stanley, Hardinge, and others.... Peel said he did not\r\nobject to throwing out the government provided it were done by us on our\r\nown principles; but that to throw them out on radical principles would\r\nbe most unwise. He agreed that less might have been done, but was not\r\nwilling to take the responsibility of refusing what the government\r\nasked. He thought that this rebellion had given a most convenient\r\nopportunity for settling the question of the Canadian constitution,\r\nwhich had long been a thorny one and inaccessible; that if we postponed\r\nthe settlement by giving the assembly another trial, the revolt would be\r\nforgotten, and in colder blood the necessary powers might be refused. He\r\nthought that when once you went into a measure of a despotic character,\r\nit was well to err, if at all, on the side of sufficiency; Lord Ripon\r\nstrongly concurred. The duke sat with his hand to his ear, turning from\r\none towards another round the circle as they took up the conversation in\r\nsuccession, and said nothing till directly and pressingly called upon by\r\nPeel, a simple but striking example of the self-forgetfulness of a great\r\nman.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 26/38._--I was myself present at about eight hours [_i.e._ on\r\nthree occasions] of discussion in Peel's house upon the Canadian\r\nquestion and bill, and there was one meeting held to which I was not\r\nsummoned. The conservative amendments were all adopted in the thoroughly\r\nstraightforward view of looking simply at the bill and not at the\r\ngovernment and the position of parties. Peel used these emphatic words:\r\n'Depend upon it, our course is the direct one; don't do anything that is\r\nwrong for the sake of putting them out; don't avoid anything that is\r\nright for the sake of keeping them in.' Every one of these points has\r\nnow been carried without limitation or exception. For the opposition\r\nparty this is, in familiar language, a feather in its cap. The whole has\r\nbeen carefully, thoroughly, and effectually done. Nothing since I have\r\nbeen in parliament--not even the defeat of the Church Rate measure last\r\nyear--has been of a kind to tell so strikingly as regards appearances\r\nupon the comparative credit of the two parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIR ROBERT PEEL'S GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n                               _Page 247_\r\n\r\n_In the great mountain of Mr. Gladstone's papers I have come across an\r\nunfinished and undated draft of a letter written by him for the Queen in\r\n1880 on Sir Robert Peel's government_:--\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gladstone with his humble duty reverts to the letter which your\r\n     Majesty addressed to him a few days back, and in which your Majesty\r\n     condescended to recollect and to remind him of the day now nearly\r\n     forty years ago, a day he fears not altogether one of pleasure to\r\n     your Majesty, when together with others he had the honour to be\r\n     sworn of your Majesty's privy council. Your Majesty is pleased to\r\n     pronounce upon the government then installed into office a high\r\n     eulogy: a eulogy which Mr. Gladstone would presume, as far as he\r\n     may, to echo. He values it, and values the recollection of the men\r\n     who principally composed it, because it was, in the first place, a\r\n     most honourable and high-minded government; because its legislative\r\n     acts tended greatly, and almost uniformly, to increase the\r\n     wellbeing of the country, and to strengthen the attachment of the\r\n     people to the throne and the laws; while it studied in all things\r\n     to maintain the reverse of an ambitious or disturbing policy.\r\n\r\n     It was Mr. Gladstone's good fortune to live on terms of intimacy,\r\n     and even affection, with the greater portion of its principal and\r\n     more active members until the close of their valued lives; and\r\n     although he is far from thinking that they, and he himself with\r\n     them, committed no serious errors, yet it is his conviction that in\r\n     many of the most important rules of public policy that government\r\n     surpassed generally the governments which have succeeded it,\r\n     whether liberal or conservative. Among them he would mention purity\r\n     in patronage, financial strictness, loyal adherence to the\r\n     principle of public economy, jealous regard to the rights of\r\n     parliament, a single eye to the public interest, strong aversion to\r\n     extension of territorial responsibilities, and a frank admission of\r\n     the rights of foreign countries as equal to those of their own.\r\n     With these recollections of the political character of Sir R. Peel\r\n     and his government Mr. Gladstone has in no way altered his feelings\r\n     of regard and respect for them. In all the points he has mentioned\r\n     he would desire to tread in their steps, and in many of them, or at\r\n     least in some, he has no hope of soon seeing them equalled. The\r\n     observance of such principles is in his conviction the best means\r\n     of disarming radicalism of whatever is dangerous in its\r\n     composition, and he would feel more completely at ease as to the\r\n     future prospects of this country could he feel more sure of their\r\n     being faithfully observed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gladstone is, and has been, but a learner through his life, and\r\n     he can claim no special gift of insight into the future: the\r\n     history of his life may not be flattering to his self-love, but he\r\n     has great consolation in believing that the great legislative acts\r\n     of the last half-century, in most of which he has had some share\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n_And here the fragment closes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CRISIS ON THE SUGAR DUTIES, 1844\r\n\r\n                               _Page 267_\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the whig government raised the question of the sugar duties, and\r\nproposed to substitute a protective duty of 12/ per cwt. for the actual\r\nor virtual prohibition of foreign sugars which had up to that time\r\nsubsisted. They were strongly opposed, and decisively beaten. The\r\nargument used against them was, I think, twofold. There was the\r\nprotection plea on behalf of the West Indians whose estates were now\r\nworked only by free labour--and there was the great and popular\r\ncontention that the measure not only admitted sugar the product of slave\r\nlabour, which we would not allow our own colonies to employ, but that\r\nour new supplies would be derived from Brazil, and above all from Cuba\r\nand Puerto Rico, where the slave trade was rampant, and was prosecuted\r\non an enormous scale. The government of Sir R. Peel largely modified our\r\nsystem. Its general professions were the abolition of prohibition, and\r\nthe reduction of protective duties to a moderate rate. In 1844 it was\r\ndetermined to deal with the sugar duties, and to admit sugar at, I\r\nthink, a rate of 10/ per cwt. beyond the rate for British-grown. But we\r\nhad to bear in mind the arguments of 1841, and it was determined that\r\nthe sugars so to be admitted were to be the product of free labour only.\r\nThere was some uncertainty from whence they were to come. Java produced\r\nsugar largely, under a system involving certain restraints, but as we\r\ncontended essentially free. The whole argument, however, was difficult\r\nand perplexed, and a parliamentary combination was formed against the\r\ngovernment. The opposition, with perfect consistency, mustered in full\r\nforce. The West Indian interest, which, though much reduced in wealth,\r\nstill subsisted as a parliamentary entity, was keenly arrayed on the\r\nsame side. There were some votes attracted by dislike, perhaps, to the\r\nargument on our side, which appeared to be complex and over-refined. A\r\nmeeting of the party was held in order to confront the crisis. Sir\r\nRobert Peel stated his case in a speech which was thought to be haughty\r\nand unconciliatory. I do not recollect whether there was hostile\r\ndiscussion, or whether silence and the sulks prevailed. But I remember\r\nthat when the meeting of the party broke up, Sir Robert Peel said on\r\nquitting the room that it was the worst meeting he had ever attended. It\r\nleft disagreeable anticipations as to the division which was in\r\nimmediate prospect.... The opposition in general had done what they\r\ncould to strengthen their momentary association with the West Indian\r\nconservatives. Their hopes of a majority depended entirely upon\r\nconservative votes. Of course, therefore, it was vital to confine the\r\nattack to the merits of the question immediately before the House, as an\r\nattack upon the policy of the government generally could only strengthen\r\nit by awakening the susceptibilities of party and so reclaiming the\r\nstray voters to the administration. Lord Howick, entering into the\r\ndebate as the hours of enhanced interest began, made a speech which\r\nattacked the conservative policy at large, and gave the opening for an\r\neffective reply. Lord Stanley perceived his opportunity and turned it to\r\naccount with great force and adroitness. In a strictly retaliatory\r\nspeech, he wound up conservative sentiment on behalf of ministers, and\r\nrestored the tone of the House. The clouds of the earlier evening hours\r\ndispersed, and the government was victorious. Two speeches, one\r\nnegatively and the other positively, reversed the prevailing current,\r\nand saved the administration. I have never known a parallel case. The\r\nwhole honour of the fray, in the ministerial sense, redounded to Lord\r\nStanley. I doubt whether in the twenty-six years of his after life he\r\never struck such a stroke as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COLONIAL POLICY\r\n\r\n                               _Page 362_\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have reversed, within the last seventy years, every one of these\r\nsalutary principles. Your policy has been this; you have retained at\r\nhome the management of and property in colonial lands. You have\r\nmagnificent sums figuring in your estimates for the ordinary expenses of\r\ntheir governments, instead of allowing them to bear their own expenses.\r\nInstead of suffering them to judge what are the measures best adapted to\r\nsecure their peaceful relations with the aboriginal tribes, and\r\nendeavouring to secure their good conduct--instead of telling them that\r\nthey must not look for help from you unless they maintain the principles\r\nof justice, you tell them, 'You must not meddle with the relations\r\nbetween yourselves and the natives; that is a matter for parliament'; a\r\nminister sitting in Downing Street must determine how the local\r\nrelations between the inhabitants of the colony and the aboriginal\r\ntribes are to be settled, in every point down to the minutest detail.\r\nNay, even their strictly internal police your soldiery is often called\r\nupon to maintain. Then, again, the idea of their electing their own\r\nofficers is, of course, revolutionary in the extreme--if not invading\r\nthe royal supremacy, it is something almost as bad, dismembering the\r\nempire; and as to making their own laws upon their local affairs without\r\ninterference or control from us, that is really an innovation so opposed\r\nto all ideas of imperial policy, that I think my honourable friend the\r\nmember for Southwark (Sir William Molesworth) has been the first man in\r\nthe House bold enough to propose it. Thus, in fact, the principles on\r\nwhich our colonial administration was once conducted have been precisely\r\nreversed. Our colonies have come to be looked upon as being, not\r\nmunicipalities endowed with internal freedom, but petty states. If you\r\nhad only kept to the fundamental idea of your forefathers, that these\r\nwere municipal bodies founded within the shadow and cincture of your\r\nimperial powers--that it was your business to impose on them such\r\npositive restraints as you thought necessary, and having done so, to\r\nleave them free in everything else--all those principles, instead of\r\nbeing reversed, would have survived in full vigour--you would have saved\r\nmillions, I was going to say countless millions, to your exchequer; but\r\nyou would have done something far more important by planting societies\r\nmore worthy by far of the source from which they spring; for no man can\r\nread the history of the great American Revolution without seeing that a\r\nhundred years ago your colonies, such as they then were, with the\r\ninstitutions they then possessed, and the political relations in which\r\nthey then stood to the mother-country, bred and reared men of mental\r\nstature and power such as far surpassed anything that colonial life is\r\nnow commonly considered to be capable of producing.--_Speech on second\r\nreading of the New Zealand Constitution bill, May_ 21, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n            FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OF 1853 AS AFFECTING IRELAND\r\n\r\n                              _Page 465_\r\n\r\n_When the report of the Irish Financial Relations Commission of 1894 was\r\nnamed to him, Mr. Gladstone made the following observations:--_\r\n\r\nThe changes adopted in that year were explained in my budget speech, and\r\nwill be found in my volume of _Financial Statements_, pp. 53, 60, and\r\n69. They affected the Spirit Duties and the Income-Tax.\r\n\r\n1. _The Spirit Duties._--We laid 8d. per gallon upon Irish spirits,\r\nimposed at the same time 1s. per gallon in Scotland, and laid it down\r\nthat the equalisation of the duty in the three countries would require a\r\nreduction of the duty of 8s. chargeable in England. Sir Robert Peel had\r\nimposed 1s. per gallon on Irish spirits in 1842, but was defeated by the\r\nsmuggler, and repealed the duty in consequence of the failure. In 1842\r\nthe duty was levied by a separate revenue police. I abolished this\r\nseparate police, and handed the duty to the constabulary force, which\r\nraised it, and without difficulty.\r\n\r\n2. _The Income-Tax_ was also in that year extended to Ireland. I pointed\r\nout that Sir Robert Peel, in imposing the burden on Great Britain,\r\nproposed to give a compensation for it by progressive reductions of duty\r\non consumable commodities, and that Ireland had for twelve years enjoyed\r\nher full share of the compensation without undergoing any part of the\r\nburden; but I also laid it down as a fundamental principle that the\r\npeace income-tax was to be temporary, and I computed that it might cease\r\nin 1860. This computation was defeated, first by the Crimean war, second\r\nby a change of ideas as to expenditure and establishments which I did\r\neverything in my power to check, but which began to creep in with, and\r\nafter, that war. We were enabled to hold it in check during the\r\ngovernment of 1859-66. It has since that time, and especially in these\r\nlast years, broken all bounds. But although the computation of 1853 was\r\ndefeated, the principle that the income-tax should be temporary was\r\nnever forgotten, at least by me, and in the year 1874 I redeemed my\r\npledge by proposing, as mentioned, to repeal it--a course which would\r\nhave saved the country a sum which it is difficult to reckon, but very\r\nlarge. This fact which was in the public mind in 1853 when the\r\nincome-tax was temporary, is the key to the whole position. From this\r\npoint of view we must combine it with the remission of the consolidated\r\nannuities. I have not now the means of making the calculation exactly,\r\nbut it will be found that a descending income-tax on Ireland for seven\r\nyears at 7d., then 6d., then 5d., is largely, though not completely,\r\nbalanced by that remission. It will thus be seen that the finance of\r\n1853 is not responsible either for a permanent peace income-tax upon\r\nIreland, or for the present equalisation of the spirit duties. At the\r\nsame time, I do not mean to condemn those measures. I condemn utterly\r\nthe extravagance of the civil expenditure in Ireland, which, if Ireland\r\nhas been unjustly taxed, cannot for a moment be pleaded as a\r\ncompensation. I reserve my judgment whether political equality can be\r\nmade compatible with privilege in point of taxation. I admit, for my own\r\npart, that in 1853 I never went back to the union whence the difficulty\r\nsprings, but only to the union of the exchequers in or about 1817. It is\r\nimpossible to resist the authority which has now affirmed that we owe a\r\npecuniary, as well as a political debt to Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FINANCIAL PROPOSAL OF 1853\r\n\r\n                             _Page 473_\r\n\r\n              _Mr. Gladstone to Sir Stafford Northcote_\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 6, 1862.--I have three main observations to make upon the\r\nconversion scheme, two of which are confessions, and one a maxim for an\r\nopposition to remember.\r\n\r\n1. In the then doubtful state of foreign politics, had I been capable of\r\nfully appreciating it at the time, I ought not to have made the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n2. Such a proposal when made by a government ought either to be resisted\r\noutright, or allowed to pass, I do not say without protest, but without\r\ndelay. For _that_ can do nothing but mischief to a proposal depending on\r\npublic impression. The same course should be taken as is taken in the\r\ncase of loans.\r\n\r\n3. I am sorry to say I made a more serious error, as regards the South\r\nSea Stocks, than the original proposal. In the summer, I think, of 1853,\r\nand a good while before harvest the company proposed to me to take Mr.\r\nGoulburn's 3 per cents. to an equal amount in lieu of their own. They\r\nwere at the time more valuable and I refused; but it would have been\r\nwise to accept, not because the event proved it so, but because the\r\nstate of things at the time was so far doubtful as to have made this\r\nkind of insurance prudent.\r\n\r\n_For the benefit of the expert, I give Mr. Gladstone's further\r\nobservations on this highly technical matter:--_\r\n\r\nI have other remarks to offer. I write, however, from memory. Three\r\nmillions of the L8,000,000 were paid in exchequer bills. The difference\r\nbetween L100 and the price of consols at the time may, in argument at\r\nleast, fairly be considered as public loss. You say it was 90 or 91. We\r\ncould not, however, if the operation had not taken place, have applied\r\nour surplus revenue with advantage to the reduction of debt. The\r\nbalances would have been richer by L5,000,000, but we had to raise seven\r\nmillions for the services of the year 1854-5. Now, as I am making myself\r\nliable for the loss of half a million of money in repaying the South Sea\r\nCompany, and thereby starving the balances, I am entitled to say on the\r\nother hand that the real loss is to be measured by the amount of\r\nnecessity created for replenishing them, and the charge entailed in\r\neffecting it. This I think was done by the exchequer bonds: and beyond\r\nall doubt a large saving was effected to the public by raising money\r\nupon those bonds, instead of borrowing in consols at 84 or thereabouts,\r\nwhich I think would have been the price for which we should in that year\r\nhave borrowed--say, at 84. The redemption price, _i.e._ the price at\r\nwhich on the average consols have been in recent times redeemed, can\r\nhardly I think be less than 95, and may be higher. There was in 1854 a\r\nstrong combination in the City to compel a 'loan' by bearing the funds;\r\nand when it was defeated by the vote of the House of Commons, a rapid\r\nreaction took place, several millions, as I understand, were lost by the\r\n'bear,' and the attempt was not renewed in 1855, when the loan was, I\r\nbelieve, made on fair terms, relatively to the state of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE REFORM BILL OF 1854\r\n\r\n                             _Page 491_\r\n\r\nIn cabinet on Wednesday Lord John Russell opened the question of the\r\nReform bill, stated the prospect of defeat on Sir E. Dering's motion,\r\nand expressed his willingness to postpone the measure until the 27th\r\nApril. Lord Palmerston recommended postponement altogether. Lord\r\nAberdeen and Graham were averse to any postponement, the latter even\r\ndeclaring his opinion that we ought at the time when the Queen's Speech\r\nwas framed to have assumed the present state of circumstances as\r\ninevitable, and that, therefore, we had no apology or ground for change;\r\nfurther, that we ought if necessary to dissolve upon defeat in order to\r\ncarry the measure. No one else went this length. All the three I have\r\nnamed were, from their different points of view, disposed to concur in\r\nthe expedient of postponement, which none of them preferred on its\r\nmerits. Of the rest of the cabinet, Molesworth and I expressed decidedly\r\nour preference for the more decided course of at once giving up the bill\r\nfor the year, as did the chancellor, and this for the ultimate interest\r\nof the plan itself. Lord Lansdowne, Wood, Clarendon, Herbert were all,\r\nwith more or less decision of phrase, in the same sense. Newcastle,\r\nGranville, and Argyll were, I believe, of the same mind. But all were\r\nwilling to accept the postponement until April 27, rather than the very\r\nserious alternative. Molesworth and I both expressed our apprehension\r\nthat this course would in the end subject the government to far more of\r\ncensure and of suspicion than if we dealt with the difficulty at once.\r\nNext day Lord John came to see me, and told me he had the idea that in\r\nApril it might probably be found advisable to divide the part of the\r\nbill which enfranchises new classes from that which disfranchises places\r\nand redistributes seats; with a view of passing the first and letting\r\nthe latter take its chance; as the popular feeling would tell for the\r\nfirst while the selfish interests were provoked by the last. He thought\r\nthat withdrawal of the bill was equivalent to defeat, and that either\r\nmust lead to a summary winding up of the session. I said the division\r\nof the bill was a new idea and a new light to me; but observed that it\r\nwould by no means help Graham, who felt himself chiefly tied to the\r\ndisfranchising part; and submitted to him that his view of a withdrawal\r\nof the bill, given such circumstances as would alone induce the cabinet\r\nto think of it, was more unfavourable than the case warranted--_March_\r\n3, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CIVIL SERVICE REFORM\r\n\r\n                               _Page 511_\r\n\r\n     _Extracts from a letter to Lord John Russell, Jan. 20, 1854_\r\n\r\n... I do not hesitate to say that one of the great recommendations of\r\nthe change in my eyes would be its tendency to strengthen and multiply\r\nthe ties between the higher classes and the possession of administrative\r\npower. As a member for Oxford, I look forward eagerly to its operation.\r\nThere, happily, we are not without some lights of experience to throw\r\nupon this part of the subject. The objection which I always hear there\r\nfrom persons who wish to retain restrictions upon elections is this: 'If\r\nyou leave them to examination, Eton, Harrow, Rugby, and the other public\r\nschools will carry _everything_.' I have a strong impression that the\r\naristocracy of this country are even superior in natural gifts, on the\r\naverage, to the mass: but it is plain that with their acquired\r\nadvantages, their _insensible education_, irrespective of book-learning,\r\nthey have an immense superiority. This applies in its degree to all\r\nthose who may be called gentlemen by birth and training; and it must be\r\nremembered that an essential part of any such plan as is now under\r\ndiscussion is the separation of _work_, wherever it can be made, into\r\nmechanical and intellectual, a separation which will open to the highly\r\neducated class a career, and give them a command over all the higher\r\nparts of the civil service, which up to this time they have never\r\nenjoyed....\r\n\r\nI must admit that the aggregate means now possessed by government for\r\ncarrying on business in the House of Commons are not in excess of the\r\nreal need, and will not bear serious diminution. I remember being\r\nalarmed as a young man when Lord Althorp said, or was said to have said,\r\nthat this country could no longer be governed by patronage. But while\r\nsitting thirteen years for a borough with a humble constituency, and\r\nspending near ten of them in opposition, I was struck by finding that\r\nthe loss or gain of access to government patronage was not traceable in\r\nits effect upon the local political influences. I concluded from this\r\nthat it was not the intrinsic value of patronage (which is really none,\r\ninasmuch as it does not, or ought not, to multiply the aggregate number\r\nof places to be given, but only acts on the mode of giving them) that\r\nwas regarded, but simply that each party liked and claimed to be upon a\r\nfooting of equality with their neighbours. Just in the same way, it was\r\nconsidered necessary that bandsmen, flagmen, and the rest, should be\r\npaid four times the value of their services, without any intention of\r\nbribery, but because it was the custom, and was done on the other\r\nside--in places where this was thought essential, it has now utterly\r\nvanished away, and yet the people vote and work for their cause as\r\nzealously as they did before. May not this after all be found to be the\r\ncase in the House of Commons as well as in many constituencies?...\r\n\r\nIt might increase the uncertainties of the government in the House of\r\nCommons on particular nights; but is not the hold even now uncertain as\r\ncompared with what it was thirty or forty years ago; and is it really\r\nweaker for general and for good purposes, on account of that\r\nuncertainty, than it then was? I have heard you explain with great force\r\nto the House this change in the position of governments since the Reform\r\nbill, as a legitimate accompaniment of changes in our political state,\r\nby virtue of which we appeal _more_ to reason, less to habit, direct\r\ninterest, or force. May not this be another legitimate and measured step\r\nin the same direction? May we not get, I will not say more ease and\r\ncertainty for the leader of the House, but more real and more honourable\r\nstrength with the better and, in the long run, the ruling part of the\r\ncommunity, by a signal proof of cordial desire that the processes by\r\nwhich government is carried on should not in elections only, but\r\nelsewhere too be honourable and pure? I speak with diffidence; but\r\nremembering that at the revolution we passed over from prerogative to\r\npatronage, and that since the revolution we have also passed from\r\nbribery to influence, I cannot think the process is to end here; and\r\nafter all we have seen of the good sense and good feeling of the\r\ncommunity, though it may be too sanguine, I cherish the hope that the\r\nday is now near at hand, or actually come, when in pursuit not of\r\nvisionary notions, but of a great practical and economical improvement,\r\nwe may safely give yet one more new and striking sign of rational\r\nconfidence in the intelligence and character of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MR. GLADSTONE AND THE BANK\r\n\r\n                                 _Page 519_\r\n\r\nFrom the time I took office as chancellor of the exchequer I began to\r\nlearn that the state held in the face of the Bank and the City an\r\nessentially false position as to finance. When those relations began,\r\nthe state was justly in ill odour as a fraudulent bankrupt who was ready\r\non occasion to add force to fraud. After the revolution it adopted\r\nbetter methods though often for unwise purposes, and in order to induce\r\nmonied men to be lenders it came forward under the countenance of the\r\nBank as its sponsor. Hence a position of subserviency which, as the idea\r\nof public faith grew up and gradually attained to solidity, it became\r\nthe interest of the Bank and the City to prolong. This was done by\r\namicable and accommodating measures towards the government, whose\r\nposition was thus cushioned and made easy in order that it might be\r\nwilling to give it a continued acquiescence. The hinge of the whole\r\nsituation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive\r\npower in matters of finance, but was to leave the money power supreme\r\nand unquestioned. In the conditions of that situation I was reluctant to\r\nacquiesce, and I began to fight against it by financial self-assertion\r\nfrom the first, though it was only by the establishment of the Post\r\nOffice Savings Banks and their great progressive development that the\r\nfinance minister has been provided with an instrument sufficiently\r\npowerful to make him independent of the Bank and the City power when he\r\nhas occasion for sums in seven figures. I was tenaciously opposed by the\r\ngovernor and deputy-governor of the Bank, who had seats in parliament,\r\nand I had the City for an antagonist on almost every occasion.--_Undated\r\nfragment_.\r\n\r\n                  THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE AND SIDNEY HERBERT\r\n\r\n                                _Page 521_\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Crimean war, I may give a curious example of the\r\npower of self-deception in the most upright men. The offices of colonial\r\nsecretary and war minister were, in conformity with usage, united in the\r\nhands of the Duke of Newcastle. On the outbreak of war it became\r\nnecessary to separate them. It evidently lay with the holder to choose\r\nwhich he would keep. The duke elected for the war department, and\r\npublicly declared that he did this in compliance with the unanimous\r\ndesire of his colleagues. And no one contradicted him. We could only\r\n'grin and bear it.' I cannot pretend to know the sentiments of each and\r\nevery minister on the matter. But I myself, and every one with whom I\r\nhappened to communicate, were very strongly of an opposite opinion. The\r\nduke was _well_ qualified for the colonial seals, for he was a\r\nstatesman; _ill_ for the war office, as he was no administrator. I\r\nbelieve we all desired that Lord Palmerston should have been war\r\nminister. It might have made a difference as to the tolerance of the\r\nfeeble and incapable administration of our army before Sebastopol.\r\nIndeed, I remember hearing Lord Palmerston suggest in cabinet the recall\r\nof Sir Richard Airy.\r\n\r\nIn that crisis one man suffered most unjustly. I mean Sidney Herbert. To\r\nsome extent, perhaps, his extraordinary and most just popularity led\r\npeople to refrain from pouring on him those vials of wrath to which his\r\noffice exposed him in the eyes especially of the uninformed. The duties\r\nof his department were really financial. I suppose it to be doubtful\r\nwhether it was not the duty of the secretary of state's department to\r\ndeal with the question of supply for the army, leaving to him only the\r\nmanagement of the purchasing part. But I conceive it could be subject to\r\nno doubt at all that it was the duty of the administrative department of\r\nthe army on the spot to anticipate and make known their wants for the\r\ncoming winter. This, if my memory serves me, they wholly failed to do:\r\nand, the Duke of Newcastle's staff being in truth very little competent,\r\nHerbert strained himself morning, noon, and night to invent wants for\r\nthe army, and according to his best judgment or conjecture to supply\r\nthem. So was laden the great steamer which went to the bottom in the\r\nharbour of Balaclava. And so came Herbert to be abused for his good\r\ndeeds.--_Autobiographic Note_, Sept. 17, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\n                                 _Page 546_\r\n\r\n                     _Mr. Gladstone to Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 18, '55.--You have conferred a great obligation on me by putting\r\nme into the witness-box, and asking me why I thought last year that we\r\nwere under an obligation to Lord Palmerston for 'concentrating the\r\nattention of the cabinet on the expedition to the Crimea.' Such was\r\n_then_ my feeling, entertained so strongly that I even wrote to him for\r\nthe purpose of giving to it the most direct expression. And such is my\r\nfeeling _still_. I think the fall of Sebastopol, viewed in itself and\r\napart from the mode in which it has been brought about, a great benefit\r\nto Europe.... This benefit I should have contemplated with high and, so\r\nto speak, unmixed satisfaction, were I well assured as to the means by\r\nwhich we had achieved it. But, of course, there is a great difference\r\nbetween a war which I felt, however grievous it was, yet to be just and\r\nneedful, and a war carried on without any adequate justification; so far\r\nas I can to this hour tell, without even any well-defined practical\r\nobject.... Your letter (if I must now pass from the defensive) seems to\r\nme to involve assumptions as to our right to rectify the distribution of\r\npolitical power by bloodshed, which carry it far beyond just bounds. In\r\nthe hour of success doctrines and policy are applauded, or pass\r\nunquestioned even under misgiving, which are very differently handled at\r\na period of disaster, or when a nation comes to feel the embarrassments\r\nit has accumulated. The government are certainly giving effect to the\r\npublic opinion of the day. If that be a justification, they have it: as\r\nall governments of England have had, in all wars, at eighteen months\r\nfrom their commencement. Apart from the commanding consideration of our\r\nduty as men and Christians, I am not less an objector to the\r\npost-April-policy, on the ground of its certain or probable\r\nconsequences--in respect first and foremost to Turkey; in respect to the\r\nproper place and power of France; in respect to the interest which\r\nEurope has in keeping her (and us all) within such place and power; in\r\nrespect to the permanence of our friendly relations with her; and\r\nlastly, in respect to the effects of continued war upon the condition of\r\nour own people, and the stability of our institutions. But each of these\r\nrequires an octavo volume. I must add another head: I view with alarm\r\nthe future use against England of the arguments and accusations we use\r\nagainst Russia.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 1.--What I find press hardest among the reproaches upon me is\r\nthis:--'You went to war for limited objects; why did you not take into\r\naccount the high probability that those objects would be lost sight of\r\nin the excitement which war engenders, and that this war, if once begun,\r\nwould receive an extension far beyond your views and wishes?'\r\n\r\n_Dec. 3._--I _do_ mean that the reproach I named is the one most nearly\r\njust. What the weight due to it is, I forbear finally to judge until I\r\nsee the conclusion of this tremendous drama. But I quite see enough to\r\nbe aware that the particular hazard in question ought to have been more\r\nsensibly and clearly before me. It _may_ be good logic and good sense, I\r\nthink, to say:--'I will forego ends that are just, for fear of being\r\ndriven upon the pursuit of others that are not so.' Whether it is so in\r\na particular case depends very much upon the probable amount of the\r\ndriving power, and of the resisting force which may be at our command.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHRONOLOGY[394]\r\n\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nDec.  13.
