As particulars of her career are not easily gathered, we\r\nmay here state that Johanna Heusser was born at Zurich, June 12, 1827.\r\nShe wrote nothing in her youth. She was happily married to the Advocate\r\nSpyri. Later, the Franco-Prussian war evoked from her a book devised\r\nfor a charitable purpose, and the success of this volume revealed her\r\nfuture. She died at her home in Zurich in 1891. Her fame has spread to\r\nall countries, and her many books have delighted not only the children\r\nfor whom they were so artfully written, but they have become favorites\r\nwith lovers of children as well.\r\n\r\nAs to \"Heidi,\" itself, wherever mountains are seen or read about, the\r\nsimple account of the early life of the Swiss child, amid the beauties\r\nof her passionately-loved home, will be a favorite book for younger\r\nreaders and those who seek their good.\r\n\r\nJohanna Spyri lived amidst the scenes she so gracefully described. In\r\nall her stories she shows an underlying desire to preserve her young\r\nreaders alike from misunderstanding and the mistaken kindness that\r\nfrequently hinders the happiness and natural development of their lives\r\nand characters.\r\n\r\nAmong her many works are the following: \"Arthur and His Squirrel,\"\r\n\"On Sunday,\" \"From the Swiss Mountains,\" \"A Scion of the House of\r\nLesa,\" \"The Great and the Small All May Aid,\" \"From Near and Far,\"\r\n\"Cornelius,\" \"Lost but Not Forgotten,\" \"Gritli's Children,\" 2 volumes,\r\n\"Without a Country,\" \"What Shall Then Become of Her?,\" \"Sina,\" \"From\r\nOur Own Country,\" \"Ten Stories,\" 2 volumes, \"In Leuchtensa,\" \"Uncle\r\nTitus,\" \"A Golden Saying,\" \"The Castle Wildenstein,\" \"What Really\r\nHappened to Her,\" \"In the Valley of the Tilonne,\" \"The Hauffer Mill.\"\r\n\r\n  M.

In spite of the hot June sun the child was clothed as if to\r\nkeep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years\r\nold, but what her natural figure was like would be hard to say, for\r\nshe had on apparently two dresses, one above the other, and over these\r\na thick red woolen shawl. Her small feet were shod in thick, nailed\r\nmountain-shoes.\r\n\r\nWhen the wayfarers came to the hamlet known as Doerfli, which is\r\nsituated half-way up the mountain, they met with greetings from all\r\nsides, for the elder girl was now in her old home. As they were\r\nleaving the village, a voice called out: \"Wait a moment, Dete; if you\r\nare going on up the mountain, I will come along with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go\r\nher hand and seated herself on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Are you tired, Heidi?\" asked her companion.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am hot,\" answered the child.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little\r\nlonger, and take good, long steps, and in another hour we shall be\r\nthere,\" said Dete.\r\n\r\nThey were now joined by a stout, good-natured looking woman, who walked\r\non ahead with her old acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"And where are you going with the child?\" asked the one who had just\r\njoined the party. \"I suppose it is the child your sister left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Dete. \"I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must\r\nstay.\"\r\n\r\n\"This child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your\r\nsenses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however,\r\nwill soon send you both packing off home again!\"\r\n\r\n\"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He\r\nmust do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now,\r\nand I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which\r\nhas just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be all very well if he were like other people,\" said\r\nBarbel, \"but you know what he is. And what can he do with a child,\r\nespecially with one so young! The child cannot possibly live with him.\r\nBut where are you thinking of going yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Frankfurt, where an extra good place awaits me,\" answered Dete.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad I am not the child,\" exclaimed Barbel. \"Not a creature knows\r\nanything about the old man up there. He will have nothing to do with\r\nanybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end\r\nto another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears\r\nout of his way. The mere sight of him, with his bushy, grey eyebrows\r\nand immense beard, is alarming enough. All kinds of things are said\r\nabout him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal\r\nconcerning him from your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I am not going to repeat what I heard. Suppose it should come\r\nto his ears. I should get into no end of trouble about it.\"\r\n\r\nBarbel put her arm through Dete's in a confidential sort of way, and\r\nsaid: \"Now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man. Was he\r\nalways shunned as he is now, and was he always so cross? I assure you I\r\nwill hold my tongue if you will tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then, I will tell you--but just wait a moment,\" said Dete,\r\nlooking around for Heidi who had slipped away unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"I see where she is,\" exclaimed Barbel, \"look over there!\" and she\r\npointed to a spot far away from the footpath. \"She is climbing up the\r\nslope yonder with Peter and his goats. But tell me about the old man.\r\nDid he ever have anything more than his two goats and his hut?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so indeed,\" replied Dete with animation; \"he was at\r\none time the owner of one of the largest farms in Domleschg, where my\r\nmother used to live. But he drank and gambled away the whole of his\r\nproperty, and when this became known to his mother and father they died\r\nof sorrow, one shortly after the other. Uncle, having nothing left to\r\nhim but his bad name, disappeared and it was heard that he had gone\r\nto Naples as a soldier. After twelve or fifteen years he reappeared\r\nin Domleschg, bringing with him a young son whom he tried to place\r\nwith some of his kinspeople. Every door, however, was shut in his\r\nface, for no one wished to have any more to do with him. Embittered\r\nby this treatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and\r\nhe then came to Doerfli where he lived with his little boy. His wife,\r\nit seemed, had died shortly after the child's birth. He must have\r\naccumulated some money during his absence, for he apprenticed his son\r\nTobias to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly received by\r\nevery one in Doerfli. His father, however, was still looked upon with\r\nsuspicion, and it was even rumored that he had killed a man in some\r\nbrawl at Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why does everyone call him Uncle? Surely he can't be uncle to\r\neveryone living in Doerfli,\" asked Barbel.\r\n\r\n\"Our grandmothers were related, so we used to call him Uncle, and as\r\nmy father had family connections with so many people in Doerfli, soon\r\neveryone fell into the habit of calling him Uncle,\" explained Dete.\r\n\r\n\"And what happened to Tobias,\" further questioned Barbel, who was\r\nlistening with deep interest.\r\n\r\n\"Tobias was taught his trade in Mels, and when he had served his\r\napprenticeship he came back to Doerfli and married my sister Adelaide.\r\nBut their happiness did not last long. Two years after their marriage\r\nTobias was killed in an accident. His wife was so overcome with grief\r\nthat she fell into a fever from which she never recovered. She had\r\nalways been rather delicate and subject to curious attacks, during\r\nwhich no one knew whether she was awake or sleeping. And so two months\r\nafter Tobias had been carried to the grave, his wife followed him.\r\nTheir sad fate was the talk of everybody far and near, and the general\r\nopinion was expressed that it was a punishment which Uncle deserved\r\nfor the godless life he had led. Our minister endeavored to awaken\r\nhis conscience, but the old man grew only more wrathful and stubborn\r\nand would not speak to a soul. All at once we heard that he had gone\r\nto live up on the Alm mountain and that he did not intend to come down\r\nagain. Since then he has led his solitary life up there, and everyone\r\nknows him now by the name of Alm-Uncle. Mother and I took Adelaide's\r\nlittle one, then only a year old, into our care. When mother died last\r\nyear, and I went down to the Baths to earn some money, I paid old Ursel\r\nto take care of her. So you see I have done my duty, now it's Uncle's\r\nturn. But where are you going to yourself, Barbel? We are now half way\r\nup the Alm.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have just reached the place I wanted,\" answered Barbel. \"I must see\r\nPeter's mother who is doing some spinning for me. So, good-bye, Dete,\r\nand good luck to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe went toward a small, dark brown hut, which stood a few steps away\r\nfrom the path in a hollow that afforded it some protection from the\r\nmountain wind.\r\n\r\nHere lived Peter, the eleven-year-old boy, with his mother Brigitta and\r\nhis blind grandmother who was known to all the old and young in the\r\nneighborhood as just \"Grandmother.\"\r\n\r\nEvery morning Peter went down to Doerfli to bring up a flock of goats\r\nto browse on the mountain. At sundown he went skipping down the\r\nmountain again with his light-footed animals. When he reached Doerfli\r\nhe would give a shrill whistle, whereupon all the owners of the goats\r\nwould come out to take home the animals that belonged to them.\r\n\r\nDete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking about her in\r\nevery direction for some sign of the children and the goats. Meanwhile\r\nHeidi and the goatherd were climbing up by a far and roundabout way,\r\nfor Peter knew many spots where all kinds of good food, in the shape\r\nof shrubs and plants, grew for his goats. The child, exhausted with\r\nthe heat and weight of her thick clothes, panted and struggled after\r\nhim, at first with some difficulty. She said nothing, but her little\r\neyes kept watching first Peter, as he sprang nimbly hither and thither\r\non his bare feet, clad only in his short, light breeches, and then\r\nthe slim-legged goats that went leaping over rocks and shrubs. All at\r\nonce she sat down on the ground, and began pulling off her shoes and\r\nstockings. Then she unwound the hot red shawl and took off her frock.\r\nBut there was still another to unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday\r\ndress on over the everyday one, to save the trouble of carrying it.\r\nQuick as lightning the everyday frock followed the other, and now the\r\nchild stood up, clad only in her light short-sleeved under garment. She\r\nstretched out her little bare arms with glee. Leaving all her clothes\r\ntogether in a tidy little heap, she went jumping and climbing up after\r\nPeter and the goats as nimbly as any of the party.\r\n\r\nNow that Heidi was able to move at her ease, she began to enter into\r\nconversation with Peter. She asked him how many goats he had, where he\r\nwas going to with them, and what he had to do when he arrived there.\r\nAt last, after some time, they came within view of Dete. Hardly had\r\nthe latter caught sight of the little company climbing up towards her\r\nwhen she shrieked out: \"Heidi, what have you been doing! What a sight\r\nyou have made of yourself! And where are your two frocks and the red\r\nwrapper? And the new shoes I bought, and the new stockings I knitted\r\nfor you--everything gone! not a thing left! What can you have been\r\nthinking of, Heidi; where are all your clothes?\"\r\n\r\nThe child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain side and\r\nanswered, \"Down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You good-for-nothing little thing!\" exclaimed Dete angrily, \"what\r\ncould have put it into your head to do that? What made you undress\r\nyourself? What do you mean by it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any clothes,\" said Heidi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You wretched, thoughtless child! have you no sense in you at all?\"\r\ncontinued Dete, scolding and lamenting. \"Peter, you go down and fetch\r\nthem for me as quickly as you can, and you shall have something nice,\"\r\nand she held out a bright new piece of money to him that sparkled in\r\nthe sun. Peter was immediately off down the steep mountain side, taking\r\nthe shortest cut, and was back again so quickly with the clothes that\r\neven Dete was obliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him\r\nthe promised money. Peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his\r\nface beamed with delight, for it was not often that he was the happy\r\npossessor of such riches.\r\n\r\n\"You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle's, as you are going\r\nthe same way,\" went on Dete, who was preparing to continue her climb\r\nup the mountain side, which rose in a steep ascent immediately behind\r\nthe goatherd's hut. Peter willingly undertook to do this, and followed\r\nafter her. After a climb of more than three-quarters of an hour they\r\nreached the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle's hut stood on a projection\r\nof the rock, exposed indeed to the winds, but where every ray of sun\r\ncould rest upon it, and a full view could be had of the valley beneath.\r\nBehind the hut stood three old fir trees, with long, thick, unlopped\r\nbranches. Beyond these rose a further wall of mountain, the lower\r\nheights still overgrown with beautiful grass and plants.\r\n\r\nAgainst the hut, on the side looking towards the valley, Uncle had put\r\nup a seat. Here he was sitting, his pipe in his mouth and his hands\r\non his knees, quietly looking out, when the children, the goats, and\r\nDete suddenly clambered into view. Heidi was at the top first. She went\r\nstraight up to the old man, put out her hand, and said, \"Good-evening,\r\nGrandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, so, what is the meaning of this?\" he asked gruffly, as he gave\r\nthe child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed at her from under\r\nhis bushy eyebrows. Heidi stared steadily back at him in return with\r\nunflinching gaze. Meanwhile Dete had come up, with Peter after her.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you good-day, Uncle,\" said Dete, as she walked towards him,\r\n\"and I have brought you Tobias and Adelaide's child. You will hardly\r\nrecognize her, as you have never seen her since she was a year old.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what has the child to do with me up here?\" asked the old man\r\ncurtly. \"You there,\" he then called out to Peter, \"be off with your\r\ngoats, you are none too early as it is, and take mine with you.\"\r\n\r\nPeter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"The child is here to remain with you,\" Dete made answer. \"I have done\r\nmy duty by her for these four years, and now it is time for you to do\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, is it?\" said the old man, as he looked at her with a flash\r\nin his eye. \"And when the child begins to fret and whine after you,\r\nwhat am I to do with her then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your affair,\" retorted Dete. \"If you cannot arrange to keep\r\nher, do with her as you like. You will be answerable for the result if\r\nharm happens to her, though you have hardly need to add to the burden\r\nalready on your conscience.\"\r\n\r\nNow Dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about what she was\r\ndoing, and consequently was feeling hot and irritable, and said more\r\nthan she had intended. As she uttered her last words, Uncle rose from\r\nhis seat. He looked at her in a way that made her draw back a step or\r\ntwo, then flinging out his arm, he said to her in a commanding voice:\r\n\"Be off with you this instant, and get back as quickly as you can to\r\nthe place whence you came, and do not let me see your face again in a\r\nhurry.\"\r\n\r\nDete did not wait to be told twice. \"Good-bye to you then, and to you\r\ntoo, Heidi,\" she called, as she turned quickly away and started to\r\ndescend the mountain at a running pace, which she did not slacken till\r\nshe found herself safely again at Doerfli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA NEW HOME WITH GRANDFATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his bench,\r\nand there he remained seated, staring at the ground without uttering a\r\nsound, while thick curls of smoke floated upward from his pipe. Heidi,\r\nmeanwhile, was enjoying herself in her new surroundings; she looked\r\nabout till she found a shed, built against the hut, where the goats\r\nwere kept; she peeped in, and saw it was empty. She continued her\r\nsearch but presently came back to where her grandfather was sitting.\r\nSeeing that he was in exactly the same position as when she left him,\r\nshe went and placed herself in front of the old man and said:\r\n\r\n\"I want to see what you have inside the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come then!\" and the grandfather rose and went before her towards the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n\"Bring your bundle of clothes in with you,\" he bid her as she was\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't want them any more,\" was her prompt answer.\r\n\r\nThe old man turned and looked searchingly at the child, whose dark eyes\r\nwere sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she was going to see\r\ninside. \"She is certainly not wanting in intelligence,\" he murmured to\r\nhimself. \"And why shall you not want them any more?\" he asked aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Because I want to go about like the goats with their thin light legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can do so if you like,\" said her grandfather, \"but bring the\r\nthings in, we must put them in the cupboard.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi did as she was told. The old man now opened the door and Heidi\r\nstepped inside after him; she found herself in a good-sized room,\r\nwhich covered the whole ground floor of the hut. A table and a chair\r\nwere the only furniture; in one corner stood the grandfather's bed, in\r\nanother was the hearth with a large kettle hanging above it; and on the\r\nfurther side was a large door in the wall--this was the cupboard. The\r\ngrandfather opened it; inside were his clothes. On a second shelf were\r\nsome plates and cups and glasses, and on a higher one still, a round\r\nloaf, smoked meat, and cheese, for everything that Alm-Uncle needed\r\nfor his food and clothing was kept in this cupboard. Heidi thrust in\r\nher bundle of clothes, as far back behind her grandfather's things as\r\npossible, so that they might not easily be found again. She then looked\r\ncarefully round the room, and asked, \"Where am I to sleep, Grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherever you like,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nHeidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the nooks and\r\ncorners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep. In the\r\ncorner near her grandfather's bed she saw a short ladder against the\r\nwall; up she climbed and found herself in the hay-loft. There lay a\r\nlarge heap of fresh, sweet-smelling hay, while through a round window\r\nin the wall she could see right down the valley.\r\n\r\n\"I shall sleep up here, Grandfather,\" she called down to him, \"it's\r\nlovely, up here. Come up and see how lovely it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know all about it,\" he called up in answer.\r\n\r\n\"I am getting the bed ready now,\" she called down again, as she went\r\nbusily to and fro at her work, \"but I shall want you to bring me up a\r\nsheet; you can't have a bed without a sheet; you want it to lie upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the grandfather, and presently he went to the\r\ncupboard, and after rummaging about inside for a few minutes he drew\r\nout a long, coarse piece of stuff, which was all he had to do duty for\r\na sheet. He carried it up to the loft, where he found Heidi had already\r\nmade quite a nice bed. She had put an extra heap of hay at one end for\r\na pillow, and had so arranged it that, when in bed, she would be able\r\nto see comfortably out through the round window.\r\n\r\n\"That is capital,\" said her grandfather; \"now we must put on the sheet.\"\r\n\r\nThey spread it over the bed, and where it was too long or too broad,\r\nHeidi quickly tucked it in under the hay. It looked as tidy and\r\ncomfortable a bed as you could wish for, and Heidi stood gazing\r\nthoughtfully at her handiwork.\r\n\r\n\"We have forgotten something now, Grandfather,\" she said after a short\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"A coverlid; when you get into bed, you have to creep in between the\r\nsheet and the coverlid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a coverlid?\"\r\nsaid the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind, Grandfather,\" said Heidi in a consoling tone of\r\nvoice, \"I can take some more hay to put over me,\" and she was turning\r\nquickly to fetch another armful from the heap, when her grandfather\r\nstopped her. \"Wait a moment,\" he said, and he climbed down the ladder\r\nagain and went towards his bed. He returned to the loft with a large,\r\nthick sack, made of flax, which he laid tidily over the bed.\r\n\r\n\"That is a splendid coverlid,\" said Heidi, \"and the bed looks lovely\r\naltogether! I wish it was night, so that I might get inside it at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better go down and have something to eat first,\" said\r\nthe grandfather.\r\n\r\nWhile the kettle was boiling the old man held a large piece of cheese\r\non a long iron fork over the fire, turning it round and round till it\r\nwas toasted a nice golden yellow color on each side. Heidi watched all\r\nthat was going on with eager curiosity. Suddenly some new idea seemed\r\nto come into her head, for she turned and ran to the cupboard, and then\r\nbegan going busily backwards and forwards. Presently the grandfather\r\ngot up and came to the table with a jug and the cheese, and there he\r\nsaw it already tidily laid with the round loaf and two plates and two\r\nknives each in its right place.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's right,\" said the grandfather, \"I am glad to see that you\r\nhave some ideas of your own,\" and as he spoke he laid the toasted\r\ncheese on a layer of bread, \"but there is still something missing.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly, and ran\r\nquickly back to the cupboard. At first she could only see a small bowl\r\nleft on the shelf, but she was not long in perplexity, for a moment\r\nlater she caught sight of two glasses further back, and without an\r\ninstant's loss of time she returned with these and the bowl and put\r\nthem down on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Good, I see you know how to set about things; but what will you do for\r\na seat?\" The grandfather himself was sitting on the only chair in the\r\nroom. Heidi flew to the hearth, and dragging the three-legged stool up\r\nto the table, sat herself down upon it.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather filled the bowl with milk, and pushed it in front\r\nof Heidi. Then he brought her a large slice of bread and a piece of\r\nthe golden cheese, and told her to eat. Heidi lifted the bowl with\r\nboth hands and drank without pause till it was empty, for the thirst\r\nof all her long, hot journey had returned upon her. Then she drew a\r\ndeep breath--in the eagerness of her thirst she had not stopped to\r\nbreathe--and put down the bowl.\r\n\r\n\"Was the milk nice?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I never drank any so good before,\" answered Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must have some more,\" and the old man filled her bowl again\r\nto the brim and set it before the child, who was now hungrily beginning\r\nher bread, having first spread it with the cheese, which after being\r\ntoasted was soft as butter. The meal being over, the grandfather went\r\noutside to put the goat-shed in order, and Heidi watched with interest\r\nwhile he first swept it out, and then put fresh straw for the goats to\r\nsleep upon. Then he went to the little well-shed, and there he cut some\r\nlong, round sticks, and a small, round board; in this he bored some\r\nholes and stuck the sticks into them, and there, as if made by magic,\r\nwas a three-legged stool just like her grandfather's, only higher.\r\nHeidi stood and looked at it, speechless with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think that is?\" asked her grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"It's my stool, I know, because it is such a high one; and it was made\r\nall of a minute,\" said the child, still lost in wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\n\"She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right place,\"\r\nremarked the grandfather to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the wind began to\r\nroar louder than ever through the old fir trees; Heidi listened with\r\ndelight to the sound, and it filled her heart so full of gladness that\r\nshe skipped and danced round the old trees, as if some unheard of joy\r\nhad come to her. The grandfather stood and watched her from the shed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEIDI TENDERLY STROKED THE TWO GOATS IN TURN]\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Down from the heights above, the\r\ngoats came springing one after another, with Peter in their midst.\r\nHeidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed among the flock,\r\ngreeting first one and then another of her old friends of the morning.\r\nAs they neared the hut the goats stood still, and then two of their\r\nnumber, two beautiful, slender animals, one white and one brown, ran\r\nforward to where the grandfather was standing and began licking his\r\nhands, for he was holding a little salt which he always had ready for\r\nhis goats on their return home. Peter went on down the mountain with\r\nthe remainder of his flock. Heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in\r\nturn, jumping about in her glee at the pretty little animals. \"Are they\r\nours, Grandfather? Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in the\r\nshed? Will they always stay with us?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi's questions came tumbling out one after the other, so that her\r\ngrandfather had only time to answer each of them with \"Yes, yes.\" When\r\nthe goats had finished licking up the salt her grandfather told her to\r\ngo and fetch her bowl and the bread.\r\n\r\nHeidi obeyed and was soon back again. The grandfather milked the white\r\ngoat and filled her basin, and then breaking off a piece of bread, \"Now\r\neat your supper,\" he said, \"and then go up to bed. Dete left another\r\nlittle bundle for you with a nightgown and other small things in it,\r\nwhich you will find at the bottom of the cupboard if you want them. I\r\nmust go and shut up the goats, so be off and sleep well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Grandfather! good-night. What are their names,\r\nGrandfather, what are their names?\" she called out as she ran after his\r\nretreating figure and the goats.\r\n\r\n\"The white one is named Little Swan, and the brown one Little Bear,\" he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!\" she called again\r\nat the top of her voice. Then she ate her supper and went indoors and\r\nclimbed up to her bed, where she was soon lying as sweetly and soundly\r\nasleep as any young princess on her couch of silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLITTLE BEAR AND LITTLE SWAN\r\n\r\n\r\nHeidi felt very happy next morning as she woke up in her new home and\r\nremembered all the many things that she had seen the day before and\r\nwhich she would see again that day, and above all she thought with\r\ndelight of the dear goats. She jumped quickly out of bed and a very few\r\nminutes sufficed her to put on the clothes which she had taken off the\r\nnight before, for there were not many of them. Then she climbed down\r\nthe ladder and ran outside the hut. There stood Peter already with his\r\nflock of goats, and the grandfather was just bringing his two out of\r\nthe shed to join the others. Heidi ran forward to wish good-morning to\r\nhim and the goats.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to go with them on to the mountain?\" asked her\r\ngrandfather. Nothing could have pleased Heidi better, and she jumped\r\nfor joy in answer.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather went inside the hut, calling to Peter to follow him and\r\nbring in his wallet. Peter obeyed with astonishment, and laid down the\r\nlittle bag which held his meagre dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Open it,\" said the old man, and he put in a large piece of bread and\r\nan equally large piece of cheese, which made Peter open his eyes, for\r\neach was twice the size of the two portions which he had for his own\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\"There, now there is only the little bowl to add,\" continued the\r\ngrandfather, \"for the child cannot drink her milk as you do from the\r\ngoat; she is not accustomed to that. You must milk two bowlfuls for her\r\nwhen she has her dinner, for she is going with you and will remain\r\nwith you till you return this evening; but take care she does not fall\r\nover any of the rocks, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nThey started joyfully for the mountain. Heidi went running hither\r\nand thither and shouting with delight, for here were whole patches\r\nof delicate red primroses, and there the blue gleam of the lovely\r\ngentian, while above them all laughed and nodded the tender-leaved\r\ngolden cistus. Enchanted with all this waving field of brightly-colored\r\nflowers, Heidi forgot even Peter and the goats. She ran on in front\r\nand then off to the side, tempted first one way and then the other, as\r\nshe caught sight of some bright spot of glowing red or yellow. And all\r\nthe while she was plucking whole handfuls of the flowers which she put\r\ninto her little apron, for she wanted to take them all home and stick\r\nthem in the hay, so that she might make her bedroom look just like the\r\nmeadows outside. Peter had therefore to be on the alert, and his round\r\neyes, which did not move very quickly, had more work than they could\r\nwell manage, for the goats were as lively as Heidi; they ran in all\r\ndirections, and Peter had to follow whistling and calling and swinging\r\nhis stick to get all the runaways together again.\r\n\r\nFinally they arrived at the spot where Peter generally halted for his\r\ngoats to pasture and where he took up his quarters for the day. It lay\r\nat the foot of the high rocks, which were covered for some distance\r\nup by bushes and fir trees, beyond which rose their bare and rugged\r\nsummits. On one side of the mountain the rock was split into deep\r\nclefts, and the grandfather had reason to warn Peter of danger. Having\r\nclimbed as far as the halting-place, Peter unslung his wallet and put\r\nit carefully in a little hollow of the ground, for he knew what the\r\nwind was like up there and did not want to see his precious belonging\r\nsent rolling down the mountain by a sudden gust. Then he threw himself\r\nat full length on the warm ground, and soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHeidi meanwhile had unfastened her apron and rolling it carefully round\r\nthe flowers laid it beside Peter's wallet inside the hollow; she then\r\nsat down beside his outstretched figure and looked about her.\r\n\r\nThe goats were climbing about among the bushes overhead. She had never\r\nfelt so happy in her life before. She drank in the golden sunlight,\r\nthe fresh air, the sweet smell of the flowers, and wished for nothing\r\nbetter than to remain there forever. Suddenly she heard a loud, harsh\r\ncry overhead and lifting her eyes she saw a bird, larger than any she\r\nhad ever seen before, with great, spreading wings, wheeling round in\r\nwide circles, and uttering a piercing, croaking kind of sound above her.\r\n\r\n\"Peter, Peter, wake up!\" called out Heidi. \"See, the great bird is\r\nthere--look, look!\"\r\n\r\nPeter got up on hearing her call, and together they sat and watched the\r\nbird, which rose higher and higher in the blue air till it disappeared\r\nbehind the grey mountain-tops.\r\n\r\n\"Where has it gone to?\" asked Heidi, who had followed the bird's\r\nmovements with intense interest.\r\n\r\n\"Home to its nest,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Is his home right up there? Oh, how nice to be up so high! why does he\r\nmake that noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he can't help it,\" explained Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Let us climb up there and see where his nest is,\" proposed Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" exclaimed Peter, his disapproval of Heidi's suggestion\r\nbecoming more marked with each ejaculation, \"why, even the goats cannot\r\nclimb as high as that, besides didn't Uncle say that you were not to\r\nfall over the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nPeter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a loud manner\r\nthat Heidi could not think what was happening; but the goats evidently\r\nunderstood his voice, for one after the other they came springing down\r\nthe rocks until they were all assembled on the green plateau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHeidi jumped up and ran in and out among them, for it was new to her to\r\nsee the goats playing together like this. Meanwhile Peter had taken the\r\nwallet out of the hollow and placed the pieces of bread and cheese on\r\nthe ground in the shape of a square, the larger two on Heidi's side and\r\nthe smaller on his own, for he knew exactly which were hers and which\r\nhis. Then he took the little bowl and milked some delicious, fresh milk\r\ninto it from the white goat, and afterwards set the bowl in the middle\r\nof the square.\r\n\r\n\"Leave off jumping about, it is time for dinner,\" said Peter; \"sit down\r\nnow and begin.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi sat down. \"Is the milk for me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEIDI DRANK IN THE GOLDEN SUNLIGHT, THE FRESH AIR\r\nAND THE SWEET SMELL OF THE FLOWERS]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Peter, \"and the two large pieces of bread and cheese\r\nare yours also, and when you have drunk up that milk, you are to have\r\nanother bowlful from the white goat, and then it will be my turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which do you get your milk from,\" inquired Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"From my own goat, the piebald one. But go on now with your dinner,\"\r\nsaid Peter, again reminding her it was time to eat. Heidi took up the\r\nbowl and drank her milk, and as soon as she had put it down empty\r\nPeter rose and filled it again for her. Then she broke off a piece\r\nof her bread and held out the remainder, which was still larger than\r\nPeter's own piece, together with the whole big slice of cheese to her\r\ncompanion, saying, \"You can have that, I have plenty.\"\r\n\r\nPeter looked at Heidi, unable to speak for astonishment. He hesitated\r\na moment, for he could not believe that Heidi was in earnest; but the\r\nlatter kept on holding out the bread and cheese, and as Peter still did\r\nnot take it, she laid it down on his knees. He saw then that she really\r\nmeant it; he seized the food, nodded his thanks and acceptance of her\r\npresent, and then made a more splendid meal than he had known ever\r\nsince he was a goat-herd. Heidi the while still continued to watch the\r\ngoats. \"Tell me all their names,\" she said.\r\n\r\nPeter knew these by heart, so he began, telling Heidi the name of each\r\ngoat in turn as he pointed it out to her. She listened with great\r\nattention, and it was not long before she could herself distinguish\r\nthe goats from one another and could call each by name, for every goat\r\nhad its own peculiarities which could not easily be mistaken. There\r\nwas the great Turk with his big horns, who was always wanting to butt\r\nthe others, so that most of them ran away when they saw him coming and\r\nwould have nothing to do with their rough companion. Only Greenfinch,\r\nthe slender, nimble, little goat, was brave enough to face him, and\r\nwould make a rush at him, three or four times in succession. Then\r\nthere was little White Snowflake, who bleated in such a plaintive\r\nand beseeching manner that Heidi already had several times run to it\r\nand taken its head in her hands to comfort it. Just at this moment\r\nthe pleading young cry was heard again, and Heidi jumped up running\r\nand, putting her arms around the little creature's neck, asked in a\r\nsympathetic voice, \"What is it, little Snowflake? Why do you call\r\nlike that as if in trouble?\" The goat pressed closer to Heidi in a\r\nconfiding way and left off bleating. Peter called out from where\r\nhe was sitting--for he had not yet got to the end of his bread and\r\ncheese--\"she cries like that because the old goat is not with her; she\r\nwas sold at Mayenfeld the day before yesterday, and so will not come up\r\nthe mountain any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the old goat?\" called Heidi back.\r\n\r\n\"Why, her mother, of course,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the grandmother?\" called Heidi again.\r\n\r\n\"She has none.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you poor little Snowflake!\" exclaimed Heidi, clasping the animal\r\ngently to her, \"but do not cry like that any more; see now, I shall\r\ncome up here with you every day, so that you will not be alone any\r\nmore, and if you want anything you have only to come to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe goats were now beginning to climb the rocks again, each seeking for\r\nthe plants it liked in its own fashion, some jumping over everything\r\nthey met till they found what they wanted, others going more carefully\r\nand cropping all the nice leaves by the way, the Turk still now and\r\nthen giving the others a poke with his horns. Little Swan and Little\r\nBear clambered lightly up and never failed to find the best bushes,\r\nand then they would stand gracefully poised on their pretty legs,\r\ndelicately nibbling at the leaves. Heidi stood with her hands behind\r\nher back, carefully noting all they did.\r\n\r\n\"Peter,\" she said to the boy who had again thrown himself down on the\r\nground, \"the prettiest of all the goats are Little Swan and Little\r\nBear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know they are,\" was the answer. \"Alm-Uncle brushes them down\r\nand washes them and gives them salt, and he has the nicest shed for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden Peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily after the\r\ngoats. Heidi followed him as fast as she could, for she was too eager\r\nto know what had happened to stay behind. Peter dashed through the\r\nmiddle of the flock towards that side of the mountain where the rocks\r\nfell perpendicularly to a great depth below, and where any thoughtless\r\ngoat, if it went too near, might fall over and break all its legs. He\r\nhad caught sight of the inquisitive Greenfinch taking leaps in that\r\ndirection, and he was only just in time, for the animal had already\r\nsprung to the edge of the abyss. All Peter could do was to throw\r\nhimself down and seize one of her hind legs. Greenfinch, thus taken by\r\nsurprise, began bleating furiously, angry at being held so fast and\r\nprevented from continuing her voyage of discovery. She struggled to get\r\nloose, and endeavored so obstinately to leap forward that Peter shouted\r\nto Heidi to come and help him, for he could not get up and was afraid\r\nof pulling out the goat's leg altogether.\r\n\r\nHeidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger both Peter and\r\nthe animal were in. She quickly gathered a bunch of sweet-smelling\r\nleaves, and then, holding them under Greenfinch's nose, said coaxingly,\r\n\"Come, come, Greenfinch, you must not be naughty! Look, you might fall\r\ndown there and break your leg, and that would give you dreadful pain!\"\r\n\r\nThe young animal turned quickly and began contentedly eating the leaves\r\nout of Heidi's hand. Meanwhile Peter got on to his feet again and took\r\nhold of Greenfinch by the band round her neck from which her bell was\r\nhung, and Heidi taking hold of her in the same way on the other side,\r\nthey led the wanderer back to the rest of the flock that had remained\r\npeacefully feeding. Peter, now he had his goat in safety, lifted his\r\nstick in order to give her a good beating as punishment, and Greenfinch\r\nseeing what was coming shrank back in fear. But Heidi cried out, \"No,\r\nno, Peter, you must not strike her; see how frightened she is!\"\r\n\r\n\"She deserves it,\" growled Peter, and again lifted his stick. Then\r\nHeidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly, \"You have no\r\nright to touch her, it will hurt her, let her alone!\"\r\n\r\nPeter looked with surprise at the commanding little figure, whose dark\r\neyes were flashing, and reluctantly he let his stick drop. \"Well,\r\nI will let her off if you will give me some more of your cheese\r\ntomorrow,\" he said, for he was determined to have something to make up\r\nto him for his fright.\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it all, tomorrow and every day, I do not want it,\"\r\nreplied Heidi, giving ready consent to his demand. \"And I will give\r\nyou bread as well, a large piece like you had today; but then you must\r\npromise never to beat Greenfinch, or Snowflake, or any of the goats.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Peter, \"I don't care,\" which meant that he would\r\nagree to the bargain, and let go of Greenfinch, who joyfully sprang to\r\njoin her companions.\r\n\r\nAnd thus imperceptibly the day had crept on to its close, and now the\r\nsun was on the point of sinking out of sight behind the high mountains.\r\nHeidi was again sitting on the ground, when all at once she sprang\r\nto her feet, \"Peter! Peter! everything is on fire! All the rocks are\r\nburning, and the great snow mountain and the sky! O look, look! the\r\nhigh rock up there is red with flame! O the beautiful, fiery snow!\r\nStand up, Peter! See, the fire has reached the great bird's nest! look\r\nat the rocks! look at the fir trees! Everything, everything is on fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is always like that,\" said Peter composedly, continuing to peel his\r\nstick; \"but it is not really fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\" cried Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"It gets like that of itself,\" explained Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Look, look!\" cried Heidi in fresh excitement, \"now they have turned\r\nall rose color! Look at that one covered with snow, and that with the\r\nhigh, pointed rocks! What do you call them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mountains have not any names,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"O how beautiful, look at the crimson snow! And up there on the rocks\r\nthere are ever so many roses! Oh! now they are turning grey! Oh! oh!\r\nnow all the color has died away! it's all gone, Peter.\" And Heidi sat\r\ndown on the ground looking as full of distress as if everything had\r\nreally come to an end.\r\n\r\n\"It will come again tomorrow,\" said Peter. \"Get up, we must go home\r\nnow.\" He whistled to his goats and together they all started on their\r\nhomeward way.\r\n\r\n\"Is it like that every day, shall we see it every day when we bring\r\nthe goats up here?\" asked Heidi, as she clambered down the mountain at\r\nPeter's side; she waited eagerly for his answer, hoping that he would\r\ntell her it was so.\r\n\r\n\"It is like that most days,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But will it be like that tomorrow for certain?\" Heidi persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, tomorrow for certain,\" Peter assured her in answer.\r\n\r\nHeidi now felt quite happy again, and her little brain was so full of\r\nnew impressions and new thoughts that she did not speak any more until\r\nthey had reached the hut. The grandfather was sitting under the fir\r\ntrees, where he had put up a new seat.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran up to him, followed by the white and brown goats, for they\r\nknew their own master and stall. Peter called out after her, \"Come with\r\nme again tomorrow! Good-night!\" For he was anxious for more than one\r\nreason that Heidi should go with him the next day.\r\n\r\n\"O, Grandfather,\" cried Heidi, \"it was so beautiful. The fire, and the\r\nroses on the rocks, and the blue and yellow flowers, and look what I\r\nhave brought you!\" And opening the apron that held her flowers she\r\nshook them all out at her grandfather's feet. But the poor flowers,\r\nhow changed they were! Heidi hardly knew them again. They looked like\r\ndried bits of hay, not a single little flower cup stood open. \"O,\r\nGrandfather, what is the matter with them?\" exclaimed Heidi in shocked\r\nsurprise, \"they were not like that this morning, why do they look so\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"They like to stand out there in the sun and not to be shut up in an\r\napron,\" said her grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will never gather any more. But, Grandfather, why did the great\r\nbird go on croaking so?\" she continued in an eager tone of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get some milk; when\r\nwe are together at supper I will tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi obeyed, and when later she was sitting on her high stool before\r\nher milk bowl with her grandfather beside her, she repeated her\r\nquestion, \"Why does the great bird go on croaking and screaming down at\r\nus, Grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is mocking at the people who live down below in the villages,\r\nbecause they all go huddling and gossipping together, and encourage one\r\nanother in evil talking and deeds. He calls out, 'If you would separate\r\nand each go your own way and come up here and live on a height as I\r\ndo, it would be better for you!'\" there was almost a wildness in the\r\nold man's voice as he spoke, so that Heidi seemed to hear the croaking\r\nof the bird again even more distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"Why haven't the mountains any names?\" Heidi went on.\r\n\r\n\"They have names,\" answered her grandfather, \"and if you can describe\r\none of them to me that I know I will tell you what it is called.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the two high peaks\r\nso exactly that the grandfather was delighted. \"Just so, I know it,\"\r\nand he told her its name.\r\n\r\nThen Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snowfield, and how\r\nit had been on fire.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather explained to her it was the sun that did it. \"When he\r\nsays good-night to the mountains he throws his most beautiful colors\r\nover them, so that they may not forget him before he comes again the\r\nnext day.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi was delighted with this explanation, and could hardly bear to\r\nwait for another day to come that she might once more climb up with the\r\ngoats and see how the sun bid good-night to the mountains. But she had\r\nto go to bed first, and all night she slept soundly on her bed of hay,\r\ndreaming of nothing but of shining mountains with red roses all over\r\nthem, among which happy little Snowflake went leaping in and out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSHOOTING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever, and then\r\nPeter appeared with the goats, and again the two children climbed up\r\ntogether to the high meadows, and so it went on day after day till\r\nHeidi, passing her life thus among the grass and flowers, was burnt\r\nbrown with the sun, and grew so strong and healthy that nothing ever\r\nailed her. She was happy too, and lived from day to day as free and\r\nlighthearted as the little birds that make their home among the green\r\nforest trees. Then the autumn came, and the wind blew louder and\r\nstronger, and the grandfather would say sometimes, \"Today you must stay\r\nat home, Heidi; a sudden gust of the wind would blow a little thing\r\nlike you over the rocks into the valley below in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked very unhappy, for\r\nhe saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead, and did not know how\r\nhe should bear the long, dull day without Heidi. Then, too, there was\r\nthe good meal he would miss, and besides that the goats on these days\r\nwere so naughty and obstinate that he had twice the usual trouble with\r\nthem, for they had grown so accustomed to Heidi's presence that they\r\nwould run in every direction and refuse to go on unless she was with\r\nthem. Heidi was never unhappy, for wherever she was she found something\r\nto interest or amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out with\r\nPeter up to the flowers and the great bird, but she also found her\r\ngrandfather's hammering and sawing and carpentering very entertaining,\r\nand if it should chance to be the day when the large, round goats'-milk\r\ncheese was made she enjoyed beyond measure watching her grandfather\r\nstir the great cauldron. The thing which attracted her most, however,\r\nwas the waving and roaring of the three old fir trees on these windy\r\ndays. She would stand underneath them and look up, unable to tear\r\nherself away, looking and listening while they bowed and swayed and\r\nroared as the mighty wind rushed through them. There was no longer now\r\nthe warm, bright sun that had shone all through the summer, so Heidi\r\nwent to the cupboard and got out her shoes and stockings and dress.\r\n\r\nThen it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early in the morning\r\nblowing on his fingers to keep them warm. But he soon left off coming,\r\nfor one night there was a heavy fall of snow and the next morning the\r\nwhole mountain was covered with it, and not a single little green leaf\r\neven was to be seen anywhere upon it. There was no Peter that day, and\r\nHeidi stood at the little window looking out in wonderment, for the\r\nsnow was beginning again, and the thick flakes kept falling till the\r\nsnow was up to the window, and still they continued to fall, and the\r\nsnow grew higher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and\r\nshe and her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi thought\r\nthis was great fun and ran from one window to the other. The next day,\r\nthe snow having ceased, the grandfather went out and shoveled it away\r\nfrom the house, and threw it into such great heaps that they looked\r\nlike mountains.\r\n\r\nHeidi and her grandfather were sitting one afternoon on their\r\nthree-legged stools before the fire when there came a great thump at\r\nthe door. It was Peter all white with snow for he had had to fight his\r\nway through deep snowdrifts. He had been determined, however, to climb\r\nup to the hut, for it was a week now since he had seen Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening,\" he said as he came in; then he went and placed himself\r\nas near the fire as he could, his whole face beaming with pleasure\r\nat finding himself there. Heidi looked on in astonishment, for Peter\r\nwas beginning to thaw all over with the warmth, so that he had the\r\nappearance of a trickling waterfall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, General, how goes it with you?\" said the grandfather, \"now that\r\nyou have lost your army you will have to turn to your pen and pencil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why must he turn to his pen and pencil,\" asked Heidi immediately, full\r\nof curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter he must go to school,\" explained her grandfather,\r\n\"and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard, although useful\r\nsometimes afterwards. Am I not right, General?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" assented Peter.\r\n\r\nHeidi's interest was now thoroughly awakened, and she had so many\r\nquestions to ask Peter about school, and the conversation took so long\r\nthat he had time to get thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some time and must\r\nwant some refreshment. Come and join us,\" said the grandfather as he\r\nbrought the supper out of the cupboard, and Heidi pushed the stools to\r\nthe table. There was also now a bench fastened against the wall, for\r\nas he was no longer alone the grandfather had put up seats of various\r\nkinds here and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi had a\r\nway of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was walking,\r\nsitting, or standing. Peter opened his round eyes very wide when he\r\nsaw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle gave him on his thick slice\r\nof bread. It was a long time since Peter had had anything so nice to\r\neat. As soon as the pleasant meal was over he began to get ready for\r\nreturning home, for it was already growing dark. He had said his\r\n\"good-night\" and his thanks, and was just going out, when he turned\r\nand said, \"I shall come again next Sunday, this day week, and my\r\ngrandmother sent word that she would like you to come and see her some\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite a new idea to Heidi that she should go and pay anybody a\r\nvisit, and she could not get it out of her head; so the first thing she\r\nsaid to her grandfather the next day was, \"I must go down to see the\r\ngrandmother today, she will be expecting me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The snow is too deep,\" answered the grandfather, trying to put her\r\noff. Not a day passed but what she said five or six times to her\r\ngrandfather, \"I must certainly go today, the grandmother will be\r\nwaiting for me.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, when Heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner\r\nwith the bright sun shining in upon her through the window, she again\r\nrepeated her little speech, \"I must certainly go down to see the\r\ngrandmother today, or else I shall keep her waiting too long.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather rose from the table, climbed up to the hayloft and\r\nbrought down the thick sack that was Heidi's coverlid, and said,\r\n\"Come along then!\" The child skipped out gleefully after him into the\r\nglittering world of snow.\r\n\r\nThe old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their branches\r\ncovered with the white snow, and they looked so lovely as they\r\nglittered and sparkled in the sunlight that Heidi jumped for joy at the\r\nsight and kept on calling out, \"Come here, come here, Grandfather! The\r\nfir trees are all silver and gold!\" The grandfather had gone into the\r\nshed and he now came out, dragging a large hand-sleigh; inside there\r\nwas a low seat, and the sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by\r\nthe feet of the one who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was\r\nfastened to the side. The old man got in and lifted the child on to his\r\nlap; then he wrapped her up in the sack, that she might keep nice and\r\nwarm, and put his left arm closely round her, for it was necessary to\r\nhold her tight during the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with\r\nhis right hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet.\r\nIt shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that Heidi thought\r\nthey were flying through the air like a bird, and shouted aloud with\r\ndelight. Suddenly they came to a standstill, and there they were at\r\nPeter's hut. Her grandfather lifted her out and unwrapped her. \"There\r\nyou are, now go in, and when it begins to grow dark you must start\r\non your way home again.\" Then he left her and went up the mountain,\r\npulling his sleigh after him.\r\n\r\nHeidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny room that\r\nlooked very dark, with a fireplace and a few dishes on a wooden shelf;\r\nthis was the little kitchen. She opened another door, and found herself\r\nin another small room, for the place was not a herdsman's hut like her\r\ngrandfather's, with one large room on the ground floor and a hay-loft\r\nabove, but a very old cottage, where everything was narrow and poor\r\nand shabby. A table was close to the door, and as Heidi stepped in she\r\nsaw a woman sitting at it, putting a patch on a waistcoat which Heidi\r\nrecognized at once as Peter's. In the corner sat an old woman, bent\r\nwith age, spinning. Heidi was quite sure this was the grandmother, so\r\nshe went up to the spinning-wheel and said, \"Good-day, Grandmother, I\r\nhave come at last; did you think I was a long time coming?\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her head and felt for the hand that the child\r\nheld out to her, and when she had found it, she passed her own over it\r\nthoughtfully for a few seconds, and then said, \"Are you the child who\r\nlives up with Alm-Uncle, are you Heidi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Heidi, \"I have just come down in the sleigh with\r\ngrandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible! Why, your hands are quite warm! Brigitta, did\r\nAlm-Uncle come himself with the child?\"\r\n\r\nPeter's mother had left her work and risen from the table and now stood\r\nlooking at Heidi with curiosity, scanning her from head to foot. \"I do\r\nnot know, mother, whether Uncle came himself; it is hardly likely, the\r\nchild probably makes a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi looked steadily at the woman, and said, \"I know quite well\r\nwho wrapped me up in my bedcover and brought me down in the sleigh: it\r\nwas grandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was some truth then perhaps in what Peter used to tell us of\r\nAlm-Uncle during the summer, when we thought he must be wrong,\" said\r\ngrandmother; \"but who would ever have believed that such a thing was\r\npossible; I did not think the child would live three weeks up there.\r\nWhat is she like, Brigitta?\"\r\n\r\nThe latter had so thoroughly examined Heidi on all sides that she was\r\nwell able to describe her to her mother.\r\n\r\nHeidi meanwhile had not been idle; she had made the round of the room\r\nand looked carefully at everything there was to be seen. All of a\r\nsudden she exclaimed, \"Grandmother, one of your shutters is flapping\r\nbackwards and forwards: grandfather would put a nail in and make it all\r\nright in a minute. It will break one of the panes some day; look, how\r\nit keeps on banging!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dear child,\" said the old woman, \"I am not able to see it, but I\r\ncan hear that and many other things besides the shutter. Everything\r\nabout the place rattles and creaks when the wind is blowing, and it\r\ngets inside through all the cracks and holes. The house is going to\r\npieces, and in the night, when the two others are asleep, I often lie\r\nawake in fear and trembling, thinking that the whole place will give\r\nway and fall and kill us. And there is not a creature to mend anything\r\nfor us, for Peter does not understand such work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why cannot you see, Grandmother, that the shutter is loose. Look,\r\nthere it goes again, see, that one there!\" And Heidi pointed to the\r\nparticular shutter.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, child, I can see nothing, nothing,\" said the grandmother in a\r\nvoice of lamentation.\r\n\r\n\"But if I were to go outside and put back the shutter so that you had\r\nmore light, then you could see, Grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not even then, no one can make it light for me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you were to go outside among all the white snow, then surely\r\nyou would find it light; just come with me, Grandmother, and I will\r\nshow you.\" Heidi took hold of the old woman's hand to lead her along,\r\nfor she was beginning to feel quite distressed at the thought of her\r\nbeing without light.\r\n\r\n\"Let me be, dear child; it is always dark for me now; whether in snow\r\nor sun. It will never be light for me again on earth, never.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words Heidi broke into loud crying. In her distress she kept\r\non sobbing out, \"Who can make it light for you again? Can no one do it?\r\nIsn't there any one who can do it?\"\r\n\r\nThe grandmother now tried to comfort the child, but it was not easy to\r\nquiet her. Heidi did not often weep, but when she did she could not get\r\nover her trouble for a long while. At last the old woman said, \"Dear\r\nHeidi, you cannot think how glad I am to hear a kind word when I can no\r\nlonger see, and it is such a pleasure to me to listen to you while you\r\ntalk. So come and sit beside me and tell me what you do up there, and\r\nhow grandfather occupies himself. I knew him very well in the old days;\r\nbut for many years now I have heard nothing of him, except through\r\nPeter, who never says much.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a new and happy idea to Heidi; she quickly dried her tears\r\nand said in a comforting voice, \"Wait, Grandmother, till I have told\r\ngrandfather everything, he will make it light for you again, I am sure,\r\nand will do something so that the house will not fall; he will put\r\neverything right for you.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi now began to give a lively description of her life with the\r\ngrandfather, and of the days she spent on the mountain with the goats,\r\nand then went on to tell what she did during the winter, and how her\r\ngrandfather was able to make all sorts of things, seats and stools, and\r\nmangers where the hay was put for Little Swan and Little Bear, besides\r\na new large water-tub for her to bathe in when the summer came, and a\r\nnew milk-bowl and spoon.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother listened with the greatest attention, only from time to\r\ntime addressing her daughter, \"Do you hear that, Brigitta? Do you hear\r\nwhat she is saying about Uncle?\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was suddenly interrupted by a heavy thump on the door,\r\nand in marched Peter, who stood stock-still, opening his eyes with\r\nastonishment, when he caught sight of Heidi; then his face beamed with\r\nsmiles as she called out, \"Good-evening, Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, is the boy back from school already,\" exclaimed the grandmother\r\nin surprise. \"I have not known an afternoon to pass so quickly as this\r\none for years. How is the reading getting on, Peter?\"\r\n\r\n\"As usual,\" was Peter's answer.\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave a little sigh, \"Ah, well,\" she said, \"I hoped you\r\nwould have something different to tell me by this time, as you are\r\ngoing to be twelve years old this February.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it you hoped he would have to tell you?\" asked Heidi,\r\ninterested in all the grandmother said.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that he ought to have learnt to read a bit by now,\" continued\r\nthe grandmother. \"Up there on the shelf is an old prayer-book, with\r\nbeautiful songs in it which I have not heard for a long time and\r\ncannot now remember to repeat to myself, and I hoped that Peter would\r\nsoon learn enough to be able to read one of them to me sometimes; but\r\nhe finds it too difficult.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi now jumped up from her low chair, and holding out her hand\r\nhastily to the grandmother said, \"Good-night, Grandmother, it is\r\ngetting dark; I must go home at once,\" and bidding good-bye to Peter\r\nand his mother she went towards the door. But the grandmother called\r\nout in an anxious voice, \"Wait, wait, Heidi, you must not go alone like\r\nthat, Peter must go with you. Have you got something warm to put round\r\nyour throat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not anything to put on,\" called back Heidi, \"but I am sure I\r\nshall not be cold,\" and with that she ran outside and went off at such\r\na pace that Peter had difficulty in overtaking her.\r\n\r\nThe children had taken but a few steps before they saw the grandfather\r\ncoming down to meet them, and in another minute his long strides had\r\nbrought him to their side.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Heidi; you have kept your word,\" said the grandfather,\r\nand then wrapping the sack firmly round her he lifted her in his arms\r\nand strode off with her up the mountain.\r\n\r\nThey had no sooner got inside the hut than Heidi at once began:\r\n\"Grandfather, tomorrow we must take the hammer and the long nails and\r\nfasten grandmother's shutter, and drive in a lot more nails in other\r\nplaces, for her house shakes and rattles all over.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEIDI NOW BEGAN TO GIVE A LIVELY DESCRIPTION OF HER LIFE\r\nWITH THE GRANDFATHER]\r\n\r\n\"We must, must we? who told you that?\" asked her grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody told me, but I know it for all that,\" replied Heidi, \"for\r\neverything is giving way, and when the grandmother cannot sleep, she\r\nlies trembling, for she thinks that every minute the house will fall\r\ndown on their heads; and everything now is dark for grandmother, and\r\nshe does not think any one can make it light for her again, but you\r\nwill be able to, I am sure, Grandfather. Tomorrow we must go and help\r\nher; we will, won't we, Grandfather?\"\r\n\r\nThe child was clinging to the old man and looking up at him in trustful\r\nconfidence. The grandfather looked down at Heidi for a while without\r\nspeaking, and then said, \"Yes, Heidi, we will do something to stop the\r\nrattling, at least we can do that; we will go down about it tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe child went skipping round the room for joy, crying out, \"We shall\r\ngo tomorrow! we shall go tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather kept his promise. On the following afternoon he brought\r\nthe sleigh out again, and as on the previous day, he set Heidi down at\r\nthe door of the grandmother's hut and said, \"Go in now, and when it\r\ngrows dark, come out again.\" Then he put the sack in the sleigh and\r\nwent round the house.\r\n\r\nHeidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the room when the\r\ngrandmother called out from her corner, \"It's the child again! here she\r\ncomes!\" Heidi ran to her, and then quickly drew the little stool close\r\nup to the old woman, and seating herself upon it, began to tell and\r\nask her all kinds of things. All at once came the sound of heavy blows\r\nagainst the wall of the hut and grandmother gave such a start of alarm\r\nthat she nearly upset the spinning-wheel, and cried in a trembling\r\nvoice, \"Ah, my God, now it is coming, the house is going to fall upon\r\nus!\" But Heidi caught her by the arm, and said soothingly, \"No, no,\r\nGrandmother, do not be frightened, it is only grandfather with his\r\nhammer; he is mending up everything, so that you shan't have such fear\r\nand trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible! is it really possible! so the dear God has not\r\nforgotten us!\" exclaimed the grandmother. \"Do you hear, Brigitta, what\r\nthat noise is? Did you hear what the child says? Go outside, Brigitta,\r\nand if it is Alm-Uncle, tell him he must come inside a moment that I\r\nmay thank him.\"\r\n\r\nBrigitta went outside and found Alm-Uncle in the act of fastening some\r\nheavy pieces of new wood along the wall. She stepped up to him and\r\nsaid, \"Good-evening, Uncle, mother and I thank you for doing us such\r\na kind service, and she would like to tell you herself how grateful\r\nshe is; I do not know who else would have done it for us; we shall not\r\nforget your kindness, for I am sure--\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said the old man, interrupting her. \"I know what you\r\nthink of Alm-Uncle without your telling me. Go indoors again, I can\r\nfind out for myself where the mending is wanted.\"\r\n\r\nBrigitta obeyed on the spot, for Uncle had a way with him that made few\r\npeople care to oppose his will. He went on knocking with his hammer all\r\nround the house, and then mounted the narrow steps to the roof, and\r\nhammered away there, until he had used up all the nails he had brought\r\nwith him. Meanwhile it had been growing dark, and he had hardly come\r\ndown from the roof and dragged the sleigh out from behind the goat-shed\r\nwhen Heidi appeared outside. The grandfather wrapped her up and took\r\nher in his arms as he had done the day before, for although he had to\r\ndrag the sleigh up the mountain after him, he feared that if the child\r\nsat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she would be\r\nnearly if not quite frozen, so he carried her warm and safe in his arms.\r\n\r\nSo the winter went by. After many years of joyless life, the blind\r\ngrandmother had at last found something to make her happy. She listened\r\nfor the little tripping footstep as soon as day had come, and when she\r\nheard the door open and knew the child was really there, she would call\r\nout, \"God be thanked, she has come again!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother, and when\r\nat last she knew for certain that no one could make it light for her\r\nagain, she was overcome with sorrow; but the grandmother told her\r\nagain that she felt the darkness much less when Heidi was with her,\r\nand so every fine winter's day the child came traveling down in her\r\nsleigh. The grandfather always took her, never raising any objection,\r\nindeed he always carried the hammer and sundry other things down in the\r\nsleigh with him, and many an afternoon was spent by him in making the\r\ngoatherd's cottage sound and tight. It no longer groaned and rattled\r\nthe whole night through, and the grandmother, who for many winters had\r\nnot been able to sleep in peace as she did now, said she should never\r\nforget what the Uncle had done for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA RAILROAD JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nHeidi was now in her eighth year; she had learnt all kinds of useful\r\nthings from her grandfather; she knew how to look after the goats as\r\nwell as any one, and Little Swan and Little Bear would follow her\r\nlike two faithful dogs, and give a loud bleat of pleasure when they\r\nheard her voice. Twice during the course of this last winter Peter had\r\nbrought up a message from the schoolmaster at Doerfli, who sent word to\r\nAlm-Uncle that he ought to send Heidi to school, as she was over the\r\nusual age, and ought indeed to have gone the winter before. Uncle had\r\nsent word back each time that the schoolmaster would find him at home\r\nif he had anything he wished to say to him, but that he did not intend\r\nto send Heidi to school.\r\n\r\nAs Heidi was running about one sunny March morning, and had just\r\njumped over the water-trough for the tenth time at least, she nearly\r\nfell backwards into it with fright, for there in front of her stood an\r\nold gentleman dressed in black. When he saw how startled she was, he\r\nsaid in a kind voice, \"Don't be afraid of me, for I am very fond of\r\nchildren. Shake hands! You must be the Heidi I have heard of; where is\r\nyour grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sitting by the table, making round wooden spoons,\" Heidi\r\ninformed him, as she opened the door.\r\n\r\nIt was the old village pastor from Doerfli who had been a neighbor of\r\nUncle's when he lived down there. He stepped inside the hut, and going\r\nup to the old man, who was bending over his work, said, \"Good-morning,\r\nneighbor.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather looked up in surprise, and then rising said,\r\n\"Good-morning\" in return. He pushed his chair towards the visitor as he\r\ncontinued, \"If you do not mind a wooden seat there is one for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe pastor sat down. \"It is a long time since I have seen you,\r\nneighbor,\" he said. \"I think you know already what it is that has\r\nbrought me here,\" and as he spoke he looked towards the child who was\r\nstanding at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Heidi, go off to the goats,\" said her grandfather. \"You can take them\r\na little salt and stay with them till I come.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi vanished on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"The child ought to have been at school a year ago, and most certainly\r\nthis last winter,\" said the pastor. \"The schoolmaster sent you word\r\nabout it, but you gave him no answer. What are you thinking of doing\r\nwith the child, neighbor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of not sending her to school,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to let her grow up then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to let her grow up and be happy among the goats and birds;\r\nwith them she is safe, and will learn nothing evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the child is not a goat or a bird, she is a human being. It is\r\ntime she began her lessons. This is the last winter she must be allowed\r\nto run wild; next winter she must come regularly to school every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will do no such thing,\" said the old man with calm determination.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that you intend to stick obstinately to your decision?\"\r\nsaid the pastor, growing somewhat angry. \"You have been about the\r\nworld, and I should have given you credit for more sense, neighbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" replied the old man, \"could you expect me to send a young\r\nchild down the mountain on ice-cold mornings through storm and\r\nsnow, and let her return at night when the wind is raging? Have you\r\nforgotten the child's mother, Adelaide? She was a sleep-walker, and\r\nhad fits. Might not the child be attacked in the same way if obliged\r\nto over-exert herself? And you think you can come and force me to send\r\nher? I will go before all the courts of justice in the country, and\r\nthen we shall see who will force me to do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right, neighbor,\" said the pastor in a friendly tone\r\nof voice. \"If it is impossible to send the child to school from here,\r\ncome down into Doerfli and live again among your fellow-men. What sort\r\nof a life is this you lead, alone, and with bitter thoughts towards God\r\nand man.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, pastor, as to going down to Doerfli to live, that is far from my\r\nthoughts; the people despise me and I them; it is therefore best for\r\nall of us that we live apart.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor had risen and stood holding out his hand to the old man\r\nas he added with renewed earnestness, \"I will wager, that next winter\r\nyou will be down among us again, and we shall be good neighbors as of\r\nold. Promise me that you will come and live with us again and become\r\nreconciled to God and man.\"\r\n\r\nAlm-Uncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him calmly and firmly,\r\n\"You mean well by me, I know, but I will not send the child to school\r\nnor come and live among you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then God help you!\" said the pastor, as he left the hut and went down\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nAlm-Uncle was out of humor. When Heidi said as usual that afternoon,\r\n\"Can we go down to grandmother now?\" he answered, \"Not today.\" He did\r\nnot speak again the whole day, and the following morning when Heidi\r\nagain asked the same question, he replied, \"We will see.\" But before\r\nthe dinner bowls bad been cleared away another visitor arrived,\r\nand this time it was Dete. She wore a fine feathered hat and a long\r\ntrailing dress which swept the floor.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather looked her up and down without uttering a word. But\r\nDete was prepared with an exceedingly amiable speech and began at once\r\nto praise the looks of the child. She should hardly have known her\r\nagain, and it was evident that Heidi had been happy and well-cared-for\r\nwith her grandfather. But she had just heard of something that would\r\nbe a lucky chance for her. Some wealthy people in Frankfurt wanted a\r\ncompanion for their only daughter who was an invalid. Heidi was just\r\nthe sort of child they were looking for, simple-minded and unspoiled,\r\nand after Dete had given them a description of Heidi, they had agreed\r\nto take her. And no one could tell what good fortune there might not\r\nbe in store for her, for if these rich people should take a fancy to\r\nHeidi--\r\n\r\n\"Have you nearly finished what you had to say?\" broke in Alm-Uncle, who\r\nhad allowed her to talk on uninterruptedly so far.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" exclaimed Dete, throwing up her head in disgust, \"one would\r\nthink I had been talking to you about the most ordinary matter; why,\r\nthere is not one person in all Praettigau who would not thank God if I\r\nwere to bring them such a piece of news as I am bringing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may take your news to anybody you like, I will have nothing to do\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nDete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried, \"If that is all\r\nyou have to say about it, why, then I will give you a bit of my mind.\r\nThe child is now eight years old and knows nothing, and you will not\r\nlet her learn. You will not send her to church or school, as I was told\r\ndown in Doerfli, and she is my own sister's child. I am responsible\r\nfor what happens to her, and this is a good opening for her. I have\r\neverybody in Doerfli on my side; there is not one person there who will\r\nnot take my part against you; and I advise you to think well before\r\nbringing it into court, if that is your intention; there are certain\r\nthings which might be brought up against you that you would not care to\r\nhear, for when one has to do with lawcourts there is a great deal raked\r\nup that had been forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent!\" thundered the Uncle, and his eyes flashed with anger. \"Go\r\nand be done with you! and never let me see you again with your hat and\r\nfeather.\" And with that he strode out of the hut.\r\n\r\n\"You have made grandfather angry,\" said Heidi, and her dark eyes had\r\nanything but a friendly expression in them as she looked at Dete.\r\n\r\n\"He will soon be all right again; come now,\" said Dete hurriedly, \"and\r\nshow me where your clothes are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not coming,\" said Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, you will have all sorts of good things that you never\r\ndreamed of.\" Then she went to the cupboard and taking out Heidi's\r\nthings rolled them up in a bundle. \"Come along now, there's your hat;\r\nit is very shabby but will do for the present; put it on and let us\r\nmake haste off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not coming,\" repeated Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be stupid and obstinate, like a goat; I suppose it's from the\r\ngoats you have learnt to be so. Listen to me: you saw your grandfather\r\nwas angry and heard what he said, that he did not wish to ever see\r\nus again; he wants you to go away with me and you must not make him\r\nangrier still. You can't think how nice it is at Frankfurt, and if you\r\ndo not like it you can come back again; your grandfather will be in a\r\ngood humor by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I return at once and be back home again here this evening?\" asked\r\nHeidi.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about, come along now! I tell you that you can\r\ncome back here when you like. Today we shall go as far as Mayenfeld,\r\nand early tomorrow we shall start in the train; it will bring you home\r\nagain in no time when you wish it, for it goes as fast as the wind.\"\r\n\r\nThey started down the mountain and as they neared the grandmother's hut\r\nthey met Peter coming round the corner carrying an immense bundle of\r\nlong, thick hazel sticks on his shoulders. He stood still and stared\r\nat the two approaching figures; as they came up to him, he exclaimed,\r\n\"Where are you going, Heidi?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only just going over to Frankfurt for a little visit with Dete,\"\r\nshe replied; \"but I must first run in to grandmother, she will be\r\nexpecting me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, you must not stop to talk; it is already too late,\" said Dete,\r\nholding Heidi, who was struggling to get away. \"You can go in when you\r\ncome back,\" and she pulled the child on with her. Peter ran into the\r\nhut and banged against the table with his bundle of sticks with such\r\nviolence that everything in the room shook, and his grandmother leaped\r\nup with a cry of alarm from her spinning-wheel.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter? what is the matter?\" cried the frightened old\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\"She is taking Heidi away,\" explained Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Who? who? where to, Peter, where to?\" asked the grandmother, growing\r\nstill more agitated; but even as she spoke she guessed what had\r\nhappened, for Brigitta had told her shortly before that she had seen\r\nDete going up to Alm-Uncle. The old woman opened the window and called\r\nout beseechingly, \"Dete, Dete, do not take the child away from us! do\r\nnot take her away!\"\r\n\r\nThe two who were hastening down the mountain heard her voice, and Dete\r\nevidently caught the words, for she grasped Heidi's hand more firmly.\r\nHeidi struggled to get free, crying, \"Grandmother is calling, I must go\r\nto her.\"\r\n\r\nBut Dete had no intention of letting the child go, and quieted her as\r\nbest she could by promising that she could take something nice back to\r\ngrandmother. This was a new idea to Heidi, and it pleased her so much\r\nthat Dete had no longer any difficulty in getting her along.\r\n\r\n\"What could I take back to her?\" Heidi asked.\r\n\r\n\"A soft roll of white bread; she would enjoy that, for now she is old\r\nshe can hardly eat the hard, black bread,\" answered Dete.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she always gives it back to Peter, telling him it is too hard,\"\r\naffirmed Heidi. \"Do let us make haste, for then perhaps we can get back\r\nsoon from Frankfurt, and I shall be able to give her the white bread\r\ntoday.\" And Heidi started off running so fast that Dete with the bundle\r\nunder her arm could scarcely keep up with her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Alm-Uncle looked fiercer and more forbidding\r\nthan ever when he came down and passed through Doerfli. He spoke to no\r\none, and looked such an ogre as he came along with his pack of cheeses\r\non his back, his immense stick in his hand, and his thick, frowning\r\neyebrows, that the women would call to their little ones, \"Take care!\r\nget out of Alm-Uncle's way or he may hurt you!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man took no notice of anybody as he strode through the village\r\non his way to the valley below, where he sold his cheeses and bought\r\nwhat bread and meat he wanted for himself. After he had passed, the\r\nvillagers all crowded together looking after him. They agreed that\r\nit was a great mercy the child had got away from him. Only the blind\r\ngrandmother would have nothing to say against him, and told those who\r\ncame to bring her work, how kind and thoughtful he had been with the\r\nchild, how good to her and her daughter, and how many afternoons he had\r\nspent mending the house. All this was repeated down in Doerfli; but\r\nmost of the people who heard it said that grandmother was too old to\r\nunderstand, and very likely had not heard rightly what was said; as she\r\nwas blind, probably she was also deaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCLARA, THE PATIENT LITTLE INVALID\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Mr. Sesemann,\r\nwas lying on the invalid couch on which she spent her whole day, being\r\nwheeled in it from room to room.\r\n\r\nHer little face was thin and pale, and at this moment her two soft blue\r\neyes were fixed on the clock, which seemed to her to go very slowly\r\nthis day, and with a slight accent of impatience, which was very rare\r\nwith her, she asked, \"Isn't it time yet, Miss Rottermeyer?\"\r\n\r\nThis lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table, busy with\r\nher embroidery. She wore a dome-shaped head piece which made her look\r\nvery solemn and dignified. For many years past, since Clara's mother\r\nhad died, the housekeeping and the superintendence of the servants had\r\nbeen entrusted to Miss Rottermeyer. The father who was often away from\r\nhome, left her in sole charge, with the condition only that his little\r\ndaughter should have a voice in all matters, and that nothing should be\r\ndone against her wish.\r\n\r\nAs Clara was putting her impatient question for the second time, Dete\r\nand Heidi arrived at the front door.\r\n\r\nTinette, the maid in dainty cap and apron, ushered them upstairs into\r\nthe library. Dete remained standing politely near the door, still\r\nholding Heidi tightly by the hand, for she did not know what the child\r\nmight take it into her head to do amid these new surroundings.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer rose slowly and went up to the little new companion\r\nfor the daughter of the house, to see what she was like. She did not\r\nseem very pleased with her appearance. Heidi was dressed in her plain\r\nlittle woolen frock, and her hat was an old straw one bent out of\r\nshape. The child looked innocently out from beneath it, gazing with\r\nunconcealed astonishment at the lady's towering head dress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked Miss Rottermeyer, after examining the child\r\nfor some minutes, while Heidi in return kept her eyes steadily fixed\r\nupon the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Heidi,\" she answered in a clear, ringing voice.\r\n\r\n\"What? what? that's no Christian name for a child; you were not\r\nchristened that. What name did they give you when you were baptized?\"\r\ncontinued Miss Rottermeyer.\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember,\" replied Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"What a way to answer!\" said the lady, shaking her head. \"Dete, is the\r\nchild a simpleton or only saucy?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the lady will allow me, I will speak for the child, for she is\r\nvery unaccustomed to strangers,\" said Dete, who had given Heidi a\r\nsilent poke for making such an unsuitable answer. \"She is certainly not\r\nstupid nor yet saucy, she speaks exactly as she thinks. This is the\r\nfirst time she has ever been in a gentleman's house and she does not\r\nknow good manners; but she is very willing to learn. She was christened\r\nAdelaide, after her mother, my sister, who is now dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a name that one can pronounce,\" remarked Miss\r\nRottermeyer. \"But I must tell you, Dete, that I am astonished to see so\r\nyoung a child. I told you that I wanted a companion of the same age as\r\nthe young lady of the house, one who could share her lessons, and all\r\nher other occupations. Miss Clara is now over twelve; what age is this\r\nchild?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the lady will allow me,\" began Dete again, in her usual fluent\r\nmanner, \"I myself had lost count of her exact age; she is certainly a\r\nlittle younger, but not much; I cannot say precisely, but I think she\r\nis ten, or thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather told me I was eight,\" put in Heidi. Dete gave her another\r\npoke, but as the child had not the least idea why she did so she was\r\nnot at all confused.\r\n\r\n\"What--only eight!\" cried Miss Rottermeyer angrily. \"Four years too\r\nyoung! Of what use is such a child! And what have you learnt? What\r\nbooks did you have to learn from?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" said Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"How? what? How then did you learn to read?\" continued the lady.\r\n\r\n\"I have never learnt to read, or Peter either,\" Heidi informed her.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy upon us! you do not know how to read! is it really so?\"\r\nexclaimed Miss Rottermeyer, greatly horrified. \"Is it possible--not\r\nable to read? What have you learnt then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Heidi with unflinching truthfulness.\r\n\r\n\"Young woman,\" said the lady to Dete, \"this is not at all the sort of\r\ncompanion we want. How could you think of bringing me a child like\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nBut Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered warmly, \"If\r\nyou will allow me, the child is exactly what I thought you required;\r\nshe is unlike all other children, and I thought this child seemed as\r\nif made for the place. But I must go now, for my mistress will be\r\nwaiting for me; if you will permit I will come again soon and see how\r\nshe is getting on.\" And with a bow Dete quickly left the room and ran\r\ndownstairs. Miss Rottermeyer stood for a moment taken aback and then\r\nran after Dete. But she had disappeared out the front door.\r\n\r\nHeidi remained where she had been standing since she first came in.\r\nClara had looked on during the interview without speaking; now she\r\nbeckoned to Heidi and said, \"Come here!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi went up to her.\r\n\r\n\"Would you rather be called Heidi or Adelaide?\" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n\"I am never called anything but Heidi,\" was the child's prompt answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall always call you by that name,\" said Clara, \"it suits you.\r\nI have never heard it before, but neither have I ever seen a child like\r\nyou before. Have you always had that short curly hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Are you pleased to come to Frankfurt?\" went on Clara.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I shall go home again tomorrow and take grandmother a white\r\nloaf,\" explained Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are a funny child!\" exclaimed Clara. \"Don't you know you\r\nwere sent for to come here and stay with me and share my lessons? They\r\nare dreadfully dull, and I think the morning will never pass away.\r\nMy tutor comes every morning at about ten o'clock, and then we go on\r\nwith lessons till two, and it does seem such a long time. Sometimes\r\nhe takes up the book and holds it close up to his face, as if he were\r\nvery short-sighted, but I know it's only because he wants to gape, and\r\nMiss Rottermeyer takes her large handkerchief out also now and then\r\nand covers her face with it, as if she was moved by what we had been\r\nreading, but that is only because she is longing to gape too. And I\r\nmyself often want to gape, but I dare not, for if Miss Rottermeyer sees\r\nme gaping she runs off at once and fetches the cod-liver oil and says I\r\nmust have a dose, as I am getting weak again, and the cod-liver oil is\r\nhorrible. But now it will be much more amusing, for I shall be able to\r\nlie back and listen while you learn to read.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning to read.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, Heidi, of course you must learn to read, everybody\r\nmust, and my tutor is very kind, and never cross, and he will explain\r\neverything to you. But mind, when he explains anything to you, you\r\nwon't be able to understand; but don't ask any questions, or else he\r\nwill go on explaining and you will understand less than ever. Later,\r\nwhen you have learnt more and know about things yourself, then you will\r\nbegin to understand what he meant.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer now came back into the room; she had not been able\r\nto overtake Dete, and was evidently very much put out. She walked\r\nbackwards and forwards in a state of agitation between the study and\r\nthe dining-room, and began scolding the butler. \"Make haste, Sebastian,\r\nor we shall get no dinner today at all,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThen hurrying out, she called to Tinette to see that the bed-room was\r\nprepared for the little girl who had just arrived.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sebastian had flung open the folding doors leading into the\r\ndining-room with rather more noise than he need, for he was feeling\r\ncross, although he did not dare answer back when Miss Rottermeyer spoke\r\nto him; he went up to Clara's chair to wheel her into the next room.\r\nHeidi stood staring at him. Seeing her eyes fixed upon him, he suddenly\r\ngrowled out, \"Well, what is there in me to stare at like that?\" which\r\nhe would certainly not have done if he had been aware that Miss\r\nRottermeyer was just then entering the room. \"You look so like Peter,\"\r\nanswered Heidi. The housekeeper clasped her hands in horror. \"Is it\r\npossible!\" she stammered half-aloud, \"she is now addressing the servant\r\nas if he were a friend! I never could have imagined such a child!\"\r\n\r\nSebastian wheeled the couch into the dining-room and helped Clara on to\r\nher chair. Miss Rottermeyer took the seat beside her and made a sign\r\nto Heidi to take the one opposite. Beside Heidi's plate lay a nice\r\nwhite roll, and her eyes lighted up with pleasure as she saw it. When\r\nSebastian came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish, she\r\nlooked at the roll and asked, \"Can I have it?\" Sebastian nodded, and\r\nHeidi immediately seized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian\r\nstill remained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to speak, nor\r\nto move away until she had helped herself. Heidi looked wonderingly at\r\nhim for a minute or two, and then said, \"Am I to eat some of that too?\"\r\nSebastian nodded again. \"Give me some then,\" she said, looking calmly\r\nat her plate.\r\n\r\n\"I see I shall have to teach you the first rules of behavior,\" said the\r\nhousekeeper with a sigh. \"You must not speak to Sebastian at table, or\r\nat any other time, unless you have an order to give him, and then you\r\nare not to address him as if he was some one belonging to you. Never\r\nlet me hear you speak to him in that way again! It is the same with\r\nTinette, and for myself you are to address me as you hear others doing.\r\nClara must herself decide what you are to call her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Clara, of course,\" put in the latter. Then followed a long list\r\nof rules as to general behavior, during the course of which Heidi's\r\neyes gradually closed, for she had been up before five o'clock that\r\nmorning and had had a long journey. She leaned back in her chair and\r\nfell fast asleep. Miss Rottermeyer having at last come to the end of\r\nher lecture said, \"Now remember what I have said, Adelaide! Have you\r\nunderstood it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heidi has been asleep for ever so long,\" said Clara, her face rippling\r\nall over with amusement, for she had not had such an entertaining\r\ndinner for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"It is really insupportable what one has to go through with this\r\nchild,\" exclaimed Miss Rottermeyer, in great indignation, and she rang\r\nthe bell so violently that Tinette and Sebastian both came running in;\r\nbut no noise was sufficient to wake Heidi, and it was with difficulty\r\nthat they roused her sufficiently to get her to her bed-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE UNFRIENDLY HOUSEKEEPER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in Frankfurt she could\r\nnot think where she was. Then she rubbed them and looked about her. She\r\nwas sitting up in a high white bed, in a large, wide room with very\r\nlong white curtains; near the window stood two chairs covered with\r\nlarge flowered material and then came a sofa with the same flowers,\r\nin front of which was a round table; in the corner was a washstand,\r\nwith things upon it that Heidi had never seen in her life before. But\r\nnow all at once she remembered that she was in Frankfurt. She jumped\r\nout of bed and dressed herself; then she ran first to one window and\r\nthen another; she wanted to see the sky and country outside; she felt\r\nlike a bird in a cage behind those great curtains. But they were too\r\nheavy for her to put aside, so she crept underneath them to get to\r\nthe window. But she could see nothing but walls and windows. She felt\r\nquite frightened and ran backwards and forwards, trying to open first\r\none and then the other of the windows, for she felt that somewhere\r\noutside there must be the green grass, and the last unmelted snows\r\non the mountain slopes. But the windows remained immovable, try what\r\nHeidi would to open them. Suddenly there was a knock on the door, and\r\nimmediately after Tinette put her head inside and said, \"Breakfast\r\nis ready.\" Heidi had no idea what an invitation so worded meant, and\r\nTinette's face did not encourage any questioning on Heidi's part. Heidi\r\nwas sharp enough to read its expression and acted accordingly. So she\r\ndrew a little stool out from under the table, put it in the corner and\r\nsat down upon it, and there silently awaited what would happen next.\r\nShortly after, Miss Rottermeyer appeared. She seemed very much put out,\r\nand called to Heidi, \"What is the matter with you, Adelaide? Don't you\r\nunderstand what breakfast is? Come along at once!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed at once.\r\nClara gave her a kindly greeting, her face looking considerably more\r\ncheerful than usual, for she looked forward to all kinds of new things\r\nhappening again that day. Breakfast passed off quietly; Heidi ate her\r\nbread and butter in a perfectly correct manner, and when the meal was\r\nover and Clara wheeled back into the study, Miss Rottermeyer told her\r\nto follow and remain with Clara until the tutor should arrive and\r\nlessons begin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the children were alone again, Heidi asked, \"How can one see\r\nout from here, and look right down on to the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must open the window and look out,\" replied Clara amused.\r\n\r\n\"But the windows won't open,\" responded Heidi sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they will,\" Clara assured her. \"You cannot open them, nor I\r\neither, but when you see Sebastian you can ask him to open one.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows could be opened\r\nand that one could look out. Clara now began to ask her questions about\r\nher home, and Heidi was delighted to tell her all about the mountain\r\nand the goats, and the flowery meadows.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her tutor had arrived; Miss Rottermeyer, however, did not\r\nbring him straight into the study but drew him first aside into the\r\ndining-room, where she poured forth her troubles. It appeared that\r\nshe had written some time back to Mr. Sesemann to tell him that his\r\ndaughter very much desired to have a companion. Miss Rottermeyer had\r\nwished for this arrangement on her own behalf, as it would relieve her\r\nfrom having always to entertain the sick girl. The father had answered\r\nthat he was quite willing to let his daughter have a companion,\r\nprovided she was treated in every way like his own child. But now she\r\nwent on to explain how dreadfully she had been taken in about the\r\nchild, and related all the unimaginable things of which she had already\r\nbeen guilty, so that not only would he have to begin with teaching\r\nher the A B C, but would have to start with the most rudimentary\r\ninstruction as regarded everything to do with daily life. She could\r\nsee only one way out of this disastrous state of affairs, and that was\r\nfor the tutor to declare that it was impossible for the two to learn\r\ntogether without detriment to Clara, who was so far ahead of the other;\r\nthat would be a good excuse for getting rid of the child. But she dared\r\nnot send her home without Mr. Sesemann's order, since he was aware\r\nthat by this time the companion had arrived. The tutor was a cautious\r\nman and said that if the little girl was backward in some things she\r\nwas probably advanced in others, and a little regular teaching would\r\nsoon set the balance right. When Miss Rottermeyer saw that he was not\r\nready to support her, and evidently quite ready to undertake teaching\r\nthe alphabet, she opened the study door, which she quickly shut again\r\nas soon as he had gone through remaining on the other side herself,\r\nfor she had a perfect horror of the A B C. She walked up and down the\r\ndining-room, thinking over in her own mind how the servants were to\r\nbe told to address Adelaide. The father had written that she was to\r\nbe treated exactly like his own daughter, and this would especially\r\nrefer, she imagined, to the servants. She was not allowed, however, a\r\nvery long interval of time for consideration, for suddenly the sound of\r\na frightful crash was heard in the study, followed by frantic cries\r\nfor Sebastian. She rushed into the room. There on the floor lay in a\r\nconfused heap, books, exercise-books and inkstand, with the table-cloth\r\non the top, while from beneath them a dark stream of ink was flowing\r\nall across the floor. Heidi had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a state of things!\" exclaimed Miss Rottermeyer. \"Table-cloth,\r\nbooks, work-basket, everything lying in the ink! It was that\r\nunfortunate child, I suppose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Heidi did it,\" explained Clara, \"but quite by accident; she must\r\non no account be punished; she jumped up in such violent haste to get\r\naway that she dragged the table-cloth along with her, and so everything\r\nwent over. There were a number of vehicles passing, that is why she\r\nrushed off like that; perhaps she has never seen a carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not as I said? She has not the smallest notion about anything!\r\nBut where is the child who has caused all this trouble? Surely she has\r\nnot run away! What would Mr. Sesemann say to me?\" She ran out of the\r\nroom and down the stairs. There, at the bottom, standing in the open\r\ndoorway, was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing? What are you thinking of to run away like that?\"\r\ncalled Miss Rottermeyer.\r\n\r\n\"I heard the sound of the fir trees, but I cannot see where they\r\nare, and now I cannot hear them any more,\" answered Heidi, looking\r\ndisappointedly in the direction whence the noise of the passing\r\ncarriages had reached her, and which to Heidi had seemed like the\r\nblowing of the south wind in the trees, so that in great joy of heart\r\nshe had rushed out to look at them.\r\n\r\n\"Fir trees! do you suppose we are in the woods? What ridiculous ideas\r\nare these? Come upstairs and see the mischief you have done!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi followed Miss Rottermeyer upstairs; she was quite astonished to\r\nsee the disaster she had caused, for in her joy and haste to get to the\r\nfir trees she had been unaware of having dragged everything after her.\r\n\r\n\"I excuse you doing this as it is the first time, but do not let me\r\nhear of you doing it a second time,\" said Miss Rottermeyer pointing to\r\nthe floor. \"During your lesson time you are to sit still and attend.\r\nIf you cannot do this I shall have to tie you to your chair. Do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Heidi, \"but I will certainly not move again,\" for now\r\nshe understood that it was a rule to sit still while she was being\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara had been placed on her couch after dinner, and the\r\nhousekeeper had retired to her room, Heidi waited for Sebastian who\r\nwas coming up from the kitchen with a tray of silver tea-things, which\r\nhe had to put away in the dining-room cupboard. As he reached the top\r\nstair Heidi went up to him and addressed him in the formal manner she\r\nhad been ordered to use by Miss Rottermeyer.\r\n\r\nSebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly, \"What is it you\r\nwant, miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can a window be opened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, like that!\" and Sebastian flung up one of the large windows.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran to it, but she was not tall enough to see out, for her head\r\nonly reached the sill.\r\n\r\n\"There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,\" said\r\nSebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand on.\r\n\r\nHeidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going to see what\r\nshe had been longing for. But she drew back her head with a look of\r\ngreat disappointment on her face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHY, THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE BUT THE STONY STREETS\"]\r\n\r\n\"Why, there is nothing outside but the stony streets,\" she said\r\nmournfully; \"but if I went right round to the other side of the house\r\nwhat should I see there, Sebastian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but what you see here,\" he told her.\r\n\r\n\"Then where can I go to see right away over the whole valley?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have to climb to the top of a high tower, a church tower,\r\nlike that one over there with the gold ball above it.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi got down quickly from her stool, ran to the door, down the steps\r\nand out into the street. She passed a great many people, but they all\r\nseemed in such a hurry that Heidi thought they had not time to tell her\r\nwhich way to go. Then suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a\r\nboy carrying a hand-organ on his back and a funny-looking animal on his\r\narm. Heidi ran up to him and said, \"Where is the tower with the gold\r\nball on the top?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any other church with a high tower?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come then and show it me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show me first what you will give me,\" and the boy held out his hand as\r\nhe spoke. Heidi searched about in her pocket and presently drew out a\r\ncard on which was painted a garland of beautiful red roses; she looked\r\nat it first for a moment or two, for she felt rather sorry to part with\r\nit; Clara had only that morning made her a present of it--but then, to\r\nlook down into the valley and see all the lovely green slopes! \"There,\"\r\nsaid Heidi holding out the card, \"would you like to have that?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy drew back his hand and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"What would you like then?\" asked Heidi, not sorry to put the card back\r\nin her pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none, but Clara has; I am sure she will give me some; how much\r\ndo you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five cents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along then.\"\r\n\r\nThey started off together along the street, and on the way Heidi asked\r\nher companion what he was carrying on his back; it was a hand-organ,\r\nhe told her, which played beautiful music when he turned the handle.\r\nAll at once they found themselves in front of an old church with a high\r\ntower; the boy said, \"There it is.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi caught sight of a bell in the wall which she now pulled with all\r\nher might. \"If I go up to the tower you must wait here, for I do not\r\nknow the way back, and you will have to show me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you give me then for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Another five cents.\"\r\n\r\nThey heard the key turning inside, and then some one pulled open the\r\nheavy, creaking door; an old man came out and at first looked with\r\nsurprise and then in anger at the children, as he began scolding them:\r\n\"What do you mean by ringing me down like this? Can't you read what is\r\nwritten over the bell, 'For those who wish to go up the tower'?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do want to go up the tower,\" said Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want up there?\" said the old man. \"Has somebody sent you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Heidi, \"I only wanted to go up and look down on the\r\nvalley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along home with you and don't try this trick again, or you may\r\nnot come off so easily a second time,\" and with that he turned and\r\nwas about to shut the door. But Heidi took hold of his coat and said\r\nbeseechingly, \"Let me go up, just once.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked round, and his mood changed as he saw her pleading eyes; he\r\ntook hold of her hand and said kindly, \"Well, if you really wish it so\r\nmuch, I will take you.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was content to\r\nwait where he was.\r\n\r\nWhen they had climbed to the top of the tower, the old man lifted Heidi\r\nup that she might look out of the open window.\r\n\r\nShe saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots; she\r\nquickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed voice, \"It\r\nis not at all what I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see now, a child like you does not understand anything about a\r\nview! Come along down and don't go ringing at my bell again!\"\r\n\r\nOn the way down they passed the tower-keeper's room. At the far end of\r\nthis was a large basket, in front of which sat a big grey cat.\r\n\r\nHeidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of delight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the sweet little things! the darling kittens,\" she kept on saying,\r\nas she jumped from side to side of the basket so as not to lose any\r\nof the droll gambols of the seven or eight little kittens that were\r\nscrambling and rolling and falling over one another.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to have one?\" said the old man, who enjoyed watching\r\nthe child's pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, to keep?\" said Heidi excitedly, who could hardly believe\r\nsuch happiness was to be hers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, more than one if you like--in short, you can take away\r\nthe whole lot if you have room for them,\" for the old man was only too\r\nglad to think he could get rid of his kittens without more trouble.\r\n\r\n\"But how can I take them with me?\" asked Heidi, and was going quickly\r\nto see how many she could carry away in her hands, when the old cat\r\nsprang at her so fiercely that she shrank back in fear.\r\n\r\n\"I will take them for you, if you tell me where,\" said the old man,\r\nstroking the cat to quiet her.\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. Sesemann's, the big house where there is a gold dog's head on\r\nthe door, with a ring in its mouth,\" explained Heidi.\r\n\r\nThe old man had had charge of the tower for many a long year and knew\r\nevery house far and near.\r\n\r\n\"I know the house,\" he said, \"but when shall I bring them, and who\r\nshall I ask for--you are not one of the family, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the kittens.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I could just take one or two away with me! one for myself and one\r\nfor Clara, may I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, wait a moment,\" said the man, and he drew the cat cautiously\r\naway into his room, and leaving her by a bowl of milk came out again\r\nand shut the door. \"Now take two of them.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi's eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white kitten and\r\nanother striped white and yellow, and put one in the right, the other\r\nin the left pocket. Then she went downstairs. The boy was still sitting\r\noutside on the steps.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time they had reached the door with the large dog's\r\nhead for a knocker. Heidi rang the bell. Sebastian opened it quickly,\r\nand when he saw it was Heidi, \"Make haste! make haste,\" he cried in a\r\nhurried voice.\r\n\r\nHeidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after her, leaving\r\nthe boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in wonder on the steps.\r\n\r\n\"Make haste, little miss,\" said Sebastian again; \"go straight into the\r\ndining-room, they are already at table; Miss Rottermeyer looks like a\r\nloaded cannon. What could make the little miss run off like that?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi walked into the room. The housekeeper did not look up, Clara\r\ndid not speak; there was an uncomfortable silence. Sebastian pushed\r\nher chair up for her, and when she was seated Miss Rottermeyer said\r\nsternly: \"Adelaide, you have behaved in a most unmannerly way by\r\nrunning out of the house as you did, without asking permission, without\r\nany one knowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till\r\nthis hour; I never heard of such behavior before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miau!\" came the answer back.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the lady's temper; with raised voice she\r\nexclaimed, \"You dare, Adelaide, after your bad behavior, to answer me\r\nas if it were a joke?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not--\" began Heidi--\"Miau! miau!\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" Miss Rottermeyer tried to say, but her voice was almost\r\nstifled with anger. \"Get up and leave the room.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to explain. \"I\r\nreally did not--\" \"Miau! miau! miau!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Heidi,\" now put in Clara, \"when you see that it makes Miss\r\nRottermeyer angry, why do you keep on saying miau?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't I, it's the kittens,\" Heidi was at last given time to say.\r\n\r\n\"How! what! kittens!\" shrieked Miss Rottermeyer. \"Sebastian! Tinette!\r\nFind the horrid little things! take them away!\" And she rose and fled\r\ninto the study and locked the door.\r\n\r\nWhen Sebastian entered the dining-room, Clara had the kittens on her\r\nlap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her, both laughing and playing with\r\nthe tiny, graceful little animals.\r\n\r\n\"Sebastian,\" exclaimed Clara as he came in, \"you must help us; you\r\nmust find a bed for the kittens where Miss Rottermeyer will not spy\r\nthem out, for she is so afraid of them that she will send them away\r\nat once; but we want to keep them, and have them out whenever we are\r\nalone. Where can you put them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will see to that,\" answered Sebastian willingly. \"I will make a bed\r\nin a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not likely to\r\ngo; you leave it to me.\" He set about the work at once, sniggling to\r\nhimself the while, for he guessed there would be a further rumpus about\r\nthis some day, and Sebastian was not without a certain pleasure in the\r\nthought of Miss Rottermeyer being a little disturbed.\r\n\r\nAfter some time had elapsed, Miss Rottermeyer opened the door a crack\r\nand called through, \"Have you taken those dreadful little animals away,\r\nSebastian?\"\r\n\r\nHe assured her twice that he had done so; and quickly and quietly\r\ncatching up the kittens from Clara's lap, disappeared with them.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer retired without speaking, Clara and Heidi following,\r\nhappy in their minds at knowing that the kittens were lying in a\r\ncomfortable bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSURPRISES FOR THE CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tutor had just been shown into the study on the following morning\r\nwhen there came a very loud ring at the bell. Sebastian opened the door\r\nand there stood a ragged little boy carrying a hand-organ on his back.\r\n\r\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" said Sebastian angrily. \"I'll teach you\r\nto ring bells like that! What do you want here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see Clara,\" the boy answered.\r\n\r\n\"You good-for-nothing little rascal, can't you be polite enough to say\r\n'Miss Clara.' What do you want with her?\" continued Sebastian roughly.\r\n\r\n\"She owes me ten cents,\" explained the boy.\r\n\r\n\"You must be out of your mind! And how do you know that any young lady\r\nof that name lives here?\"\r\n\r\n\"She owes me five for showing her the way there, and five for showing\r\nher the way back.\"\r\n\r\n\"The young lady never goes out, cannot even walk; be off and get back\r\nto where you came from, before I have to help you along.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy was not to be frightened away, and said in a determined\r\nvoice, \"But I saw her in the street, and can describe her to you; she\r\nhas short, curly black hair, and black eyes, and wears a brown dress,\r\nand does not talk quite like we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" thought Sebastian, laughing to himself, \"the little miss has\r\nevidently been up to more mischief.\" Then, drawing the boy inside he\r\nsaid aloud, \"I understand now, come with me and wait outside the door\r\ntill I tell you to go in. Be sure you begin playing your organ the\r\ninstant you get inside the room; the lady is very fond of music.\"\r\n\r\nSebastian knocked at the study door, and a voice said, \"Come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a boy outside who says he must speak to Miss Clara herself,\"\r\nSebastian announced.\r\n\r\nClara was delighted at such an extraordinary and unexpected message.\r\n\r\n\"Let him come in at once,\" replied Clara.\r\n\r\nThe boy was already inside the room, and according to Sebastian's\r\ndirections immediately began to play his organ. Miss Rottermeyer\r\nhearing the music rushed into the room and saw the ragged boy turning\r\naway at his organ in the most energetic manner.\r\n\r\n\"Leave off! leave off at once!\" she screamed. But her voice was drowned\r\nby the music. She was making a dash for the boy, when she saw something\r\non the ground crawling towards her feet--a dreadful dark object--a\r\ntortoise. At this sight she jumped higher than she had for many long\r\nyears before, shrieking with all her might, \"Sebastian! Sebastian!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take them all out, boy and animal! Get them away at once!\" she\r\ncommanded him.\r\n\r\nSebastian pulled the boy away, the latter having quickly caught up his\r\ntortoise, and when he had got him outside he put something into his\r\nhand. \"There is the ten cents from Miss Clara, and another ten cents\r\nfor the music. You did it all quite right!\" and with that he shut the\r\nfront door upon him.\r\n\r\nQuietness reigned again in the study, and lessons began once more; Miss\r\nRottermeyer now stayed in the study in order to prevent any further\r\ndreadful goings-on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS ROTTERMEYER JUMPED HIGHER THAN SHE HAD FOR\r\nMANY LONG YEARS]\r\n\r\nBut soon another knock came to the door, and Sebastian again stepped\r\nin, this time to say that someone had brought a large basket with\r\norders that it was to be given at once to Miss Clara.\r\n\r\n\"For me?\" said Clara in astonishment, her curiosity very much excited,\r\n\"bring it in at once that I may see what it is like.\"\r\n\r\nSebastian carried in a large covered basket and retired.\r\n\r\n\"I think the lessons had better be finished first before the basket is\r\nunpacked,\" said Miss Rottermeyer.\r\n\r\nClara could not conceive what was in it, and cast longing glances\r\ntowards it. In the middle of one of her declensions she suddenly broke\r\noff and said to the tutor, \"Mayn't I just give one peep inside to see\r\nwhat is in it before I go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"On some considerations I am for it, on others against it,\" he began\r\nin answer; \"for it, on the ground that if your whole attention is\r\ndirected to the basket--\" but the speech remained unfinished. The cover\r\nof the basket was loose, and at this moment one, two, three, and then\r\ntwo more kittens came suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing\r\nabout the room in every direction. They jumped over the tutor's boots,\r\nclimbed up Miss Rottermeyer's dress, rolled about her feet, sprang up\r\non to Clara's couch, scratching, scrambling, and mewing. Clara kept on\r\nexclaiming, \"Oh, the dear little things! how pretty they are! Look,\r\nHeidi, at this one; look, look, at that one over there!\" And Heidi in\r\nher delight kept running after them first into one corner and then into\r\nthe other. The tutor stood up by the table not knowing what to do. Miss\r\nRottermeyer was unable at first to speak at all, so overcome was she\r\nwith horror, and she did not dare rise from her chair for fear that all\r\nthe dreadful little animals should jump upon her at once. At last she\r\nfound voice to call loudly, \"Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!\"\r\n\r\nThey came in answer to her summons and gathered up the kittens; by\r\ndegrees they got them all inside the basket again and then carried them\r\noff to put with the other two.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rottermeyer learned that Heidi was to blame for having the\r\nkittens brought into the house she was very angry and said:\r\n\r\n\"Adelaide, you little barbarian, you shall be put in a dark cellar with\r\nthe rats and black beetles.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi listened in silence and surprise to her sentence, for she had\r\nnever seen a cellar such as was now described; the place known at her\r\ngrandfather's as the cellar, where the fresh cheeses and the new milk\r\nwere kept, was a pleasant and inviting place; neither did she know at\r\nall what rats and black beetles were like.\r\n\r\nBut now Clara interrupted in great distress. \"No, no, Miss Rottermeyer,\r\nyou must wait till papa comes; he has written to say that he will soon\r\nbe home, and then I will tell him everything, and he will say what is\r\nto be done with Heidi.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer could not do anything against this superior authority,\r\nespecially as the father was really expected very shortly. She rose and\r\nsaid with some displeasure, \"As you will, Clara, but I too shall have\r\nsomething to say to Mr. Sesemann.\" And with that she left the room.\r\n\r\nTwo days now went by without further disturbance. Miss Rottermeyer,\r\nhowever, could not recover her equanimity; she was perpetually reminded\r\nby Heidi's presence of the deception that had been played upon her,\r\nand it seemed to her that ever since the child had come into the\r\nhouse everything had been topsy-turvy, and she could not bring things\r\ninto proper order again. Clara had grown much more cheerful; she no\r\nlonger found time hang heavy during the lesson hours, for Heidi was\r\ncontinually making a diversion of some kind or other. She jumbled all\r\nher letters up together and seemed quite unable to learn them, and\r\nwhen the tutor tried to draw her attention to their different shapes,\r\nand to help her by showing her that this was like a little horn,\r\nor that like a bird's bill, she would suddenly exclaim in a joyful\r\nvoice, \"That is a goat!\" \"That is a bird of prey!\". For the tutor's\r\ndescriptions suggested all kinds of pictures to her mind, but left her\r\nstill incapable of the alphabet. In the later afternoons Heidi always\r\nsat with Clara, and told her of the mountain and of her life upon it,\r\nand the longing to return would become so overpowering that she always\r\nfinished with the words, \"Now I must go home! tomorrow I must really\r\ngo!\" But Clara would try to quiet her and tell Heidi that she must\r\nwait till her father returned, and then they would see what was to be\r\ndone. After dinner Heidi had to sit alone in her room for a couple of\r\nhours, for she understood now that she might not run about outside at\r\nFrankfurt as she did on the mountain, and so she did not attempt it.\r\n\r\nAt times she could hardly contain herself for the longing to be back\r\nhome again. She remembered that Dete had told her that she could go\r\nhome whenever she liked. So it came about one day that Heidi felt she\r\ncould not bear it any longer. She tied all the rolls up in her red\r\nshawl, put on her straw hat, and went downstairs. But just as she\r\nreached the hall-door she met Miss Rottermeyer, just returning from a\r\nwalk, which put a stop to Heidi's journey.\r\n\r\n\"What have you dressed yourself like that for?\" exclaimed Miss\r\nRottermeyer. \"What do you mean by this? Have I not strictly forbidden\r\nyou to go running about in the streets? And here you are ready to start\r\noff again, and going out looking like a beggar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not going to run about, I was going home,\" said Heidi frightened.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about! Going home! What would Mr. Sesemann say\r\nif he knew! And what is the matter with his house, I should like to\r\nknow! Have you ever in your life before had such a house to live in,\r\nsuch a table, or so many to wait upon you? Have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"I should think not, indeed!\" continued the exasperated lady. \"You are\r\nan ungrateful little thing to be always thinking of what naughty thing\r\nyou can do next!\"\r\n\r\nThen Heidi's feelings got the better of her, and she poured forth her\r\ntrouble. \"Indeed I only want to go home, for if I stay so long away\r\nSnowflake will begin crying again, and grandmother is waiting for me,\r\nand Greenfinch will get beaten, because I am not there to give Peter\r\nany cheese, and I can never see here how the sun says good-night to the\r\nmountains; and if the great bird were to fly over Frankfurt he would\r\ncroak louder than ever about people huddling all together and teaching\r\neach other bad things, and not going to live up on the rocks, where it\r\nis so much better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven have mercy on us, the child is out of her mind!\" cried Miss\r\nRottermeyer, and she turned and went quickly up the steps. \"Go and\r\nbring that unhappy little creature in at once,\" she ordered Sebastian.\r\n\r\n\"What, are you in trouble again?\" said Sebastian in a pleasant voice,\r\nas he led Heidi back up the stairs. He tried to cheer her up by telling\r\nher he was taking good care of all the kittens. But she was too sad to\r\ncare and silently crept away to her room.\r\n\r\nAt supper that evening she sat without moving or eating; all she did\r\nwas to hastily hide her roll in her pocket.\r\n\r\nNext day Miss Rottermeyer made up her mind that she would supplement\r\nHeidi's clothing with various garments from Clara's wardrobe, so as to\r\ngive her a decent appearance when Mr. Sesemann returned. She confided\r\nher intention to Clara, who was quite willing to give up any number\r\nof dresses and hats to Heidi; so the lady went upstairs to overhaul\r\nthe child's belongings and see what was to be kept and what thrown\r\naway. She returned, however, in the course of a few minutes with an\r\nexpression of horror upon her face.\r\n\r\n\"What is this, Adelaide, that I find in your wardrobe!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\"I never heard of any one doing such a thing before! In a cupboard\r\nmeant for clothes, Adelaide, what do I see at the bottom but a heap of\r\nrolls! Will you believe it, Clara, bread in a wardrobe! a whole pile of\r\nbread!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tinette,\" she called, \"go upstairs and take away all those rolls out\r\nof Adelaide's cupboard and the old straw hat on the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" screamed Heidi. \"I must keep the hat, and the rolls are for\r\ngrandmother,\" and she was rushing to stop Tinette when Miss Rottermeyer\r\ncaught hold of her: \"You will stop here, and all that bread and rubbish\r\nshall be taken to the place they belong to,\" she said in a determined\r\ntone as she kept her hand on the child to prevent her running forward.\r\n\r\nHeidi flung herself down on Clara's couch and broke into a wild fit\r\nof weeping, sobbing out at intervals, \"Now grandmother's bread is all\r\ngone! They were all for grandmother, and now they are taken away, and\r\ngrandmother won't have one,\" and she wept as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nShe could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would never have\r\nbeen able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for Clara's\r\npromise that she should have fresh, new rolls to take to grandmother\r\nwhen the time came for her to go home.\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi got into bed that night she found her old straw hat lying\r\nunder the counterpane. She snatched it up with delight, made it more\r\nout of shape still in her joy, and then, after wrapping a handkerchief\r\nround it, she stuck it in a corner of the cupboard as far back as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nIt was Sebastian who had hidden it there for her; he had been in the\r\ndining-room when Tinette was called, and had heard all that went on\r\nwith the child and the latter's loud weeping. So he followed Tinette,\r\nand when she came out of Heidi's room carrying the rolls and the hat,\r\nhe caught up the hat and said, \"I will see to this old thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMR. SESEMANN TAKES HEIDI'S PART\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after these events there was great commotion and much\r\nrunning up and down stairs in Mr. Sesemann's house. The master had just\r\nreturned, and Sebastian and Tinette were busy carrying up one package\r\nafter another from the carriage, for Mr. Sesemann always brought back\r\na lot of pretty things for his home. He himself had not waited to do\r\nanything before going in to see his daughter. Heidi was sitting beside\r\nher, for it was late afternoon, when the two were always together.\r\nFather and daughter greeted each other with warm affection, for they\r\nwere deeply attached to one another. Then he held out his hand to\r\nHeidi, who had stolen away into the corner, and said kindly to her,\r\n\"And this is our little Swiss girl; come and shake hands with me!\r\nThat's right! Now, tell me, are Clara and you good friends with one\r\nanother, or do you get angry and quarrel, and then cry and make it up,\r\nand then start quarrelling again on the next occasion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Clara is always kind to me,\" answered Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"And Heidi,\" put in Clara quickly, \"has not once tried to quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, I am glad to hear it,\" said her father, as he rose\r\nfrom his chair. \"But you must excuse me, Clara, for I have had nothing\r\nto eat all day. Afterwards I will show you all the things I have\r\nbrought home with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe found Miss Rottermeyer in the dining-room and when he had taken his\r\nplace she sat down opposite to him, looking so gloomy that he turned to\r\nher and said, \"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sesemann,\" began the lady in a solemn voice, \"we have been\r\nfrightfully imposed upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, in what way?\" asked Mr. Sesemann as he went on calmly drinking\r\nhis wine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I supposed I was getting a well-behaved and nicely brought up\r\nlittle Swiss girl for Clara's companion but I have been shockingly,\r\ndisgracefully imposed upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how? what is there shocking and disgraceful? I see nothing\r\nshocking in the child,\" remarked Mr. Sesemann quietly.\r\n\r\n\"If you only knew the kind of people and animals she has brought into\r\nthe house during your absence! The tutor can tell you more about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Animals? what am I to understand by animals, Miss Rottermeyer?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is past understanding; the whole behavior of the child would be\r\npast understanding, if it were not that at times she is evidently not\r\nin her right mind.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door opened and the tutor was announced. \"Ah! here\r\nis some one,\" exclaimed Mr. Sesemann, \"who will help to clear up\r\nmatters for me. Take a seat,\" he continued, as he held out his hand to\r\nthe tutor. \"And now tell me, what is the matter with this child that\r\nhas come to be a companion to my daughter?\"\r\n\r\nThe tutor started in his usual style. \"If I must give my opinion about\r\nthis little girl, I should like first to state that, if on one side,\r\nthere is a lack of development which has been caused by the more or\r\nless careless way in which she has been brought up--\"\r\n\r\n\"My good friend,\" interrupted Mr. Sesemann, \"you are giving yourself\r\nmore trouble than you need. I only want to know what your opinion is as\r\nto her being a fit companion or not for my daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not like in any way to prejudice you against her,\" began\r\nthe tutor once more; \"for if on the one hand there is a certain\r\ninexperience of the ways of society, owing to the uncivilized life she\r\nled up to the time of her removal to Frankfurt, on the other hand she\r\nis endowed with certain good qualities, and, taken on the whole--\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my dear sir, do not disturb yourself, but I must--I think\r\nmy daughter will be wanting me,\" and with that Mr. Sesemann quickly\r\nleft the room and went into the study to talk to Clara.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear,\" he said, drawing his chair nearer and laying her\r\nhand in his, \"what kind of animals has your little companion brought\r\ninto the house, and why does Miss Rottermeyer think that she is not\r\nalways in her right mind?\"\r\n\r\nClara had no difficulty in answering. She told her father everything\r\nabout the tortoise and the kittens, and explained to him what Heidi\r\nhad said the day Miss Rottermeyer had been put in such a fright. Mr.\r\nSesemann laughed heartily at her recital. \"So you do not want me to\r\nsend the child home again,\" he asked, \"you are not tired of having her\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no,\" Clara exclaimed, \"please do not send her away. Time has\r\npassed much more quickly since Heidi has been here, for something fresh\r\nhappens every day, and it used to be so dull, and she has always so\r\nmuch to tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening when Mr. Sesemann and Miss Rottermeyer were alone,\r\nsettling the household affairs, he informed her that he intended to\r\nkeep Heidi, for his daughter liked her as a companion. \"I desire,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"that the child shall be in every way kindly treated, and\r\nthat her peculiarities shall not be looked upon as crimes. If you find\r\nher too much for you alone, I can hold out a prospect of help for I am\r\nexpecting my mother here on a long visit, and she, as you know, can get\r\nalong with anybody, whatever they may be like.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, I know,\" replied Miss Rottermeyer, but there was no tone of\r\nrelief in her voice as she thought of the coming help.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann was only home for a short time; he left for Paris again\r\nbefore the fortnight was over, comforting Clara with the prospect of\r\nher grandmother's arrival, which was to take place in a few days'\r\ntime. Clara talked so much about her grandmother that Heidi began also\r\nto call her \"grandmamma,\" which brought forth a look of displeasure\r\nfrom Miss Rottermeyer. As she was going to her room that night, Miss\r\nRottermeyer waylaid her, and gave her strict orders not to call Mrs.\r\nSesemann \"grandmamma,\" but always to say \"madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLARA'S LOVABLE GRANDMOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much expectation and preparation about the house on the\r\nfollowing evening, for Grandmother Sesemann was coming. Tinette had a\r\nnew white cap on her head, and Sebastian collected all the footstools\r\nhe could find and placed them in convenient spots, so that the lady\r\nmight find one ready to her feet whenever she chose to sit.\r\n\r\nAt last the carriage came driving up to the door, and Tinette and\r\nSebastian ran down the steps, followed by the housekeeper, who advanced\r\nto greet the guest. Heidi had been sent up to her room and ordered to\r\nremain there until called down, as the grandmother would certainly\r\nlike to see Clara alone first. Heidi sat herself down in a corner and\r\nrepeated her instructions over to herself. She had not to wait long\r\nbefore Tinette put her head in and said abruptly, \"Go downstairs into\r\nthe study.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi had not dared to ask Miss Rottermeyer again how she was to\r\naddress the grandmother: she thought the lady had perhaps made a\r\nmistake, for she had never heard any one called by other than their\r\nright name. As she opened the study door she heard a kind voice say,\r\n\"Ah, here comes the child! Come along and let me have a good look at\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi walked up to her and said very distinctly in her clear voice,\r\n\"Good-evening, Mrs. Madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the grandmother laughing, \"is that how they address people\r\nin your home on the mountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Heidi gravely, \"I never knew any one with that name\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I either,\" laughed the grandmother again as she patted Heidi's\r\ncheek. \"Never mind! when I am with the children I am always grandmamma;\r\nyou won't forget that name, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" Heidi assured her, \"I often used to say it at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said the grandmother, with a cheerful little nod of\r\nthe head. Then she looked more closely at Heidi, and the child looked\r\nback at her with steady, serious eyes, for there was something kind\r\nand warm-hearted about this newcomer that pleased Heidi, and indeed\r\neverything about the grandmother attracted her. She had such beautiful\r\nwhite hair, and two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her head\r\nand waved gently about her face every time she moved, as if a soft\r\nbreeze were blowing round her, which gave Heidi a peculiar feeling of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"And what is your name, child?\" the grandmother now asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am always called Heidi; but as I am now to be called Adelaide, I\r\nwill try and take care--\" Heidi stopped short, for Miss Rottermeyer was\r\nat this moment entering the room.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sesemann will no doubt agree with me,\" she interrupted, \"that it\r\nwas necessary to choose a name that could be pronounced easily, if only\r\nfor the sake of the servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"My worthy Rottermeyer,\" replied Mrs. Sesemann, \"if a person is called\r\n'Heidi' and has grown accustomed to that name, I call her by the same,\r\nand so let it be.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer was always very much annoyed that the old lady\r\ncontinually addressed her by her surname only; but it was no use\r\nminding, for the grandmother always went her own way, and so there\r\nwas no help for it. Moreover, the grandmother was a keen old lady, and\r\nhad all her five wits about her, and she knew what was going on in the\r\nhouse as soon as she entered it.\r\n\r\nWhen on the following day Clara lay down as usual on her couch after\r\ndinner, the grandmother sat down beside her for a few minutes and\r\nclosed her eyes, then she got up again as lively as ever, and trotted\r\noff into the dining-room. No one was there. \"Heidi is asleep, I\r\nsuppose,\" she said to herself, and then going up to Miss Rottermeyer's\r\nroom she gave a loud knock at the door. She waited a few minutes and\r\nthen Miss Rottermeyer opened the door and drew back in surprise at this\r\nunexpected visit.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the child, and what is she doing all this time?\" said Mrs.\r\nSesemann.\r\n\r\n\"She is sitting in her room, where she could well employ herself if she\r\nhad the least idea of making herself useful; but you have no idea, Mrs.\r\nSesemann, of the out-of-the-way things this child imagines and does.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should do the same if I had to sit in there like that child, I can\r\ntell you; go bring her to my room; I have some pretty books with me\r\nthat I should like to give her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just the misfortune,\" said Miss Rottermeyer with a despairing\r\ngesture, \"what use are books to her? She has not been able to learn\r\nher A B C's even, all the long time she has been here; it is quite\r\nimpossible to get the least idea of them into her head, and that the\r\ntutor himself will tell you; if he had not the patience of an angel he\r\nwould have given up teaching her long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very strange,\" said Mrs. Sesemann, \"she does not look to me\r\nlike a child who would be unable to learn her alphabet.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi now appeared and gazed with open-eyed delight and wonder at the\r\nbeautiful colored pictures in the books which the grandmother gave\r\nher to look at. All of a sudden the child gave a start and burst into\r\nsobs, for she had turned to a picture of a green pasture, full of young\r\nanimals, some grazing and others nibbling at the shrubs. In the middle\r\nwas a shepherd leaning upon his staff and looking on at his happy flock.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother laid her hand kindly on Heidi's. \"Don't cry, dear\r\nchild, don't cry,\" she said, \"the picture has reminded you perhaps of\r\nsomething. But see, there is a beautiful tale to the picture which I\r\nwill tell you this evening. And there are other nice tales of all kinds\r\nto read and to tell again. But now we must have a little talk together,\r\nso dry your tears and come and stand in front of me and tell me how you\r\nare getting on in your school-time; do you like your lessons, and have\r\nyou learnt a great deal?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no!\" replied Heidi sighing, \"but I knew beforehand that it was not\r\npossible to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it you think impossible to learn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, to read, it is too difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so! and who told you that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter told me, and he knew all about it, for he had tried and tried\r\nand could not learn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter must be a very odd boy then! But listen, Heidi, you must not\r\nalways go by what Peter says. You must believe what I tell you--and I\r\ntell you that you can learn to read in a very little while, as many\r\nother children do, who are made like you and not like Peter. As soon as\r\nyou are able to read you shall have that book for your own.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi had listened with eager attention to the grandmother's words and\r\nnow with a sigh exclaimed, \"Oh, if only I could read now!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't take you long now to learn, that I can see; and now we must\r\ngo down to Clara; bring the books with you.\" And hand in hand the two\r\nreturned to the study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the day when Heidi had so longed to go home, and Miss Rottermeyer\r\nhad met her and scolded her on the steps, and told her how wicked\r\nand ungrateful she was to try and run away, a change had come over\r\nthe child. She at last understood that she could not go home when\r\nshe wished as Dete had told her, but that she would have to stay on\r\nin Frankfurt for a long, long time, perhaps for ever. The weight\r\nof trouble on the little heart grew heavier and heavier; she could\r\nno longer eat her food, and every day she grew a little paler. She\r\nlay awake for long hours at night, for as soon as she was alone and\r\neverything was still around her, the picture of the mountain with its\r\nsunshine and flowers rose vividly before her eyes; and when at last she\r\nfell asleep it was to dream of the rocks and the snow-field turning\r\ncrimson in the evening light, and waking in the morning she would\r\nthink herself back at the hut and prepare to run joyfully out into the\r\nsun--and then--there was her large bed, and here she was in Frankfurt\r\nfar, far away from home. And Heidi would often lay her face down on the\r\npillow and weep long and quietly so that no one might hear her.\r\n\r\nHer unhappiness did not escape the grandmother's notice. One day she\r\ncalled her into her room, and said, \"Now tell me, Heidi, what is the\r\nmatter; are you in trouble?\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi, afraid if she told the truth that the grandmother would\r\nthink her ungrateful, and would then leave off being so kind to her,\r\nanswered, \"I can't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, could you tell Clara about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, I cannot tell any one,\" said Heidi in so positive a tone, and\r\nwith a look of such trouble on her face, that the grandmother felt full\r\nof pity for the child.\r\n\r\n\"Then, dear child, let me tell you what to do: you know that when we\r\nare in great trouble, and cannot speak about it to anybody, we must\r\nturn to God and pray Him to help. You say your prayers every evening do\r\nyou not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never say any prayers,\" answered Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never been taught to pray, Heidi; do you not know even what\r\nit means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to say prayers with the first grandmother, but that is a long\r\ntime ago, and I have forgotten them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the reason, Heidi, that you are so unhappy, because you know\r\nno one who can help you. Think what a comfort it is to be able to tell\r\neverything to God, and pray Him for the help that no one else can give\r\nus. And He can aid us and give us everything that will make us happy\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden gleam of joy came into Heidi's eyes. \"May I tell Him\r\neverything, everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, everything, Heidi, everything.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi drew her hand away, which the grandmother was holding\r\naffectionately between her own, and said quickly, \"May I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" was the answer, and Heidi ran out of the room into\r\nher own, and sitting herself on a stool, folded her hands together\r\nand told God about everything that was making her so sad and unhappy,\r\nand begged Him earnestly to help her and to let her go home to her\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nIt was about a week after this that the tutor informed Mrs. Sesemann\r\nthat Heidi had really learnt to read at last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANDMOTHER'S KIND ADVICE BRINGS COMFORT TO HEIDI]\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed truly marvelous,\" he said, \"because she never seemed able\r\nto even learn her A B C's before. I had made up my mind to make no\r\nfurther attempts at the impossible, but to put the letters as they were\r\nbefore her without any dissertation on their origin and meaning. Now\r\nshe has learnt her letters and started at once to read correctly, quite\r\nunlike most beginners.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening Heidi found the large book with the pictures, lying\r\non her plate when she took her place at table, and when she looked\r\nquestioningly at the grandmother, the latter nodded kindly to her and\r\nsaid, \"Yes, it's yours now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine, to keep always? even when I go home?\" said Heidi, blushing with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, yours for ever,\" the grandmother assured her.\r\n\"Tomorrow we will begin to read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are not going home yet, Heidi, not for years,\" put in Clara.\r\n\"When grandmother goes away, I shall want you to stay on with me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi went to her room that night she had another look at her book\r\nbefore going to bed, and from that day forth her chief pleasure was to\r\nread over and over again, the tales which belonged to the beautiful\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHOME-SICKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon when Clara was resting after dinner, the grandmother\r\nwould take Heidi to her own room where she had a lot of pretty dolls,\r\nand she showed her how to make dresses and aprons for them, so that the\r\nchild learned how to sew and to make all sorts of beautiful clothes for\r\nthe little people. And then grandmother liked to hear her read aloud,\r\nand the oftener Heidi read her tales the fonder she grew of them. But\r\nstill she never looked really happy, and her eyes were no longer bright.\r\n\r\nIt was the last week of the grandmother's visit. She called Heidi into\r\nher room as usual one day after dinner, and the child came with her\r\nbook under her arm. The old lady laid the book aside, and said, \"Now,\r\nmy dear, tell me why you are not happy? Have you still the same trouble\r\nat heart?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi nodded in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Have you told God about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you pray every day that He will make things right and that you\r\nmay be happy again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have left off praying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not tell me that, Heidi! Why have you left off praying?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEIDI LEARNS TO MAKE DOLL CLOTHES]\r\n\r\n\"It is of no use, God does not listen,\" Heidi went on in an agitated\r\nvoice, \"and I can understand that when there are so many, many people\r\nin Frankfurt praying to Him every evening that He cannot attend to\r\nthem all, and He certainly has not heard what I said to Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why are you so sure of that, Heidi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have prayed for the same thing every day for weeks, and yet\r\nGod has not done what I asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, Heidi; you must not think of Him like that. God is a\r\ngood father to us all, and knows better than we do what is good for us.\r\nHe did not think what you have been praying for was good for you just\r\nnow; but be sure He heard you, for He can hear and see every one at the\r\nsame time, because He is a God and not a human being like you and me.\r\nWhile God is watching over you, and looking to see if you will trust\r\nHim and go on praying to Him every day, you run away and leave off\r\nsaying your prayers, and forget all about Him. You would not like to\r\ngrieve God, would you, Heidi, when He only wants to be kind to you? So\r\nwill you not go and ask Him to forgive you, and continue to pray and to\r\ntrust Him, for you may be sure that He will make everything right and\r\nhappy for you, and then you will be glad and lighthearted again.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi had perfect confidence in the grandmother, and every word she\r\nsaid sank into her heart.\r\n\r\n\"I will go at once and ask God to forgive me, and I will never forget\r\nHim again,\" she replied repentantly.\r\n\r\nAnd she ran away and prayed that she might always remember God, and\r\nthat He would go on thinking about her.\r\n\r\nThe day came for grandmother's departure--a sad one for Clara and\r\nHeidi. But the grandmother was determined to make it as much like a\r\nholiday as possible and not to let them mope, and she kept them so\r\nlively and amused that they had no time to think about their sorrow\r\nat her going until she really drove away. Then the house seemed so\r\nsilent and empty that Heidi and Clara did not know what to do with\r\nthemselves, and sat during the remainder of the day like two lost\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMany weeks passed away. Heidi did not know if it was winter or summer,\r\nfor the walls and windows she looked out upon showed no change, and she\r\nnever went beyond the house except on rare occasions when Clara was\r\nwell enough to drive out, and then they only went a very little way,\r\nas Clara could not bear the movement for long. On these occasions they\r\ngenerally only saw more fine streets and large houses and crowds of\r\npeople; they seldom got anywhere beyond them, and grass and flowers,\r\nfir trees and mountains, were still far away. Heidi's longing for the\r\nold familiar and beautiful things grew daily stronger, so that now only\r\nto read a word that recalled them to her remembrance brought her to the\r\nverge of tears, which she suppressed with difficulty. So the autumn and\r\nwinter passed, and again the sun came shining down on the white walls\r\nof the opposite houses, and Heidi would think to herself that now the\r\ntime had come for Peter to go out again with the goats, to where the\r\ngolden flowers of the cistus were glowing in the sunlight, and all the\r\nrocks around turned to fire at sunset. She would go and sit in a corner\r\nof her lonely room and put her hands up to her eyes that she might not\r\nsee the sun shining on the opposite wall; and then she would remain\r\nwithout moving, battling silently with her terrible home-sickness until\r\nClara sent for her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\"MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some days past Miss Rottermeyer had gone about rather silently\r\nand as if lost in thought. As twilight fell, and she passed from room\r\nto room, or along the long corridors, she was seen to look cautiously\r\nbehind her, and into the dark corners, as if she thought some one was\r\ncoming up silently behind her and might unexpectedly give her dress a\r\npull. Nor would she now go alone into some parts of the house. If she\r\nvisited the upper floor where the grand guest-chambers were, or had to\r\ngo down into the large drawing room, where every footstep echoed, she\r\ncalled Tinette to accompany her.\r\n\r\nFor something very strange and mysterious was going on in Mr.\r\nSesemann's house. Every morning, when the servants went downstairs,\r\nthey found the front door wide open, although nobody could be seen far\r\nor near to account for it. During the first few days that this happened\r\nevery room and corner was searched in great alarm, to see if anything\r\nhad been stolen, for the general idea was that a thief had been hiding\r\nin the house and had gone off in the night with the stolen goods; but\r\nnot a thing in the house had been touched, everything was safe in its\r\nplace. The door was doubly locked at night, and for further security\r\nthe wooden bar was fastened across it; but it was no good--next morning\r\nthe door again stood open. At last, after a great deal of persuasion\r\nfrom Miss Rottermeyer, Sebastian and John plucked up courage and\r\nagreed to sit up one night to watch and see what would happen. Miss\r\nRottermeyer hunted up several weapons belonging to the master, and\r\ngave these and a bottle of brandy to them so that their courage might\r\nnot faint if it came to a fight.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed night the two sat down and began at once to take some\r\nof the strengthening cordial, which at first made them very talkative\r\nand then very sleepy, so that they leant back in their seats and became\r\nsilent. As midnight struck, Sebastian roused himself and called to his\r\ncompanion, who, however, was not easy to wake, and kept rolling his\r\nhead first to one side and then the other and continuing to sleep.\r\nSebastian began to listen more attentively, for he was wide awake now.\r\nHe did not feel inclined to go to sleep again, for the stillness was\r\nghostly to him, and he was afraid now to raise his voice to rouse John,\r\nso he shook him gently to make him stir. At last, as one struck, John\r\nwoke up, and came back to the consciousness of why he was sitting in\r\na chair instead of lying in his bed. He got up with a great show of\r\ncourage and said, \"Come, Sebastian, we must go out in the hall and see\r\nwhat is going on; you need not be afraid, just follow me.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he opened the door wide and stepped into the hall. Just as\r\nhe did so a sudden gust of air blew through the open front door and\r\nput out the light which John held in his hand. He started back, almost\r\noverturning Sebastian, whom he clutched and pulled back into the room,\r\nand then shutting the door quickly he turned the key as far as he could\r\nmake it go. Then he pulled out his matches and lighted his candle\r\nagain. Sebastian, in the suddenness of the affair, did not know exactly\r\nwhat had happened, for he had not seen the open front door or felt the\r\nbreeze behind John's broad figure. But now, as he saw the latter in the\r\nlight, he gave a cry of alarm, for John was trembling all over and was\r\nas white as a ghost. \"What's the matter? What did you see outside?\"\r\nasked Sebastian sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"The door partly open,\" gasped John, \"and a white figure standing at\r\nthe top of the steps--there it stood, and then all in a minute it\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\nSebastian felt his blood run cold. The two sat down close to one\r\nanother and did not dare move again till the morning broke and the\r\nstreets began to be alive again. Then they left the room together,\r\nshut the front door, and went upstairs to tell Miss Rottermeyer of\r\ntheir experience. They had no sooner given her details of the night's\r\nexperience than she sat down and wrote to Mr. Sesemann, who had never\r\nreceived such a letter before in his life. She could hardly write, she\r\ntold him, for her fingers were stiff with fear, and Mr. Sesemann must\r\nplease arrange to come back at once, for dreadful and unaccountable\r\nthings were taking place at home. Then she entered into particulars of\r\nall that had happened, of how the door was found standing open every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann answered that it was quite impossible for him to arrange\r\nto leave his business and return home at once.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer, however, was determined not to pass any more days\r\nin a state of fear, and she knew the right course to pursue. She had\r\nas yet said nothing to the children of the ghostly apparitions, for\r\nshe knew if she did that the children would not remain alone for a\r\nsingle moment, and that might entail discomfort for herself. But now\r\nshe walked straight off into the study, and there in a low, mysterious\r\nvoice told the two children everything that had taken place. Clara\r\nimmediately screamed out that she could not remain another minute\r\nalone, her father must come home.\r\n\r\nSo Miss Rottermeyer wrote another letter to Mr. Sesemann, stating\r\nthat these unaccountable things that were going on in the house had\r\nso affected his daughter's delicate constitution that the worst\r\nconsequences might be expected. Epileptic fits and St. Vitus's dance\r\noften came on suddenly in cases like this, and Clara was liable to be\r\nattacked by either if the cause of the general alarm was not removed.\r\n\r\nThe letter was successful, and two days later Mr. Sesemann arrived home.\r\n\r\nClara greeted him with a cry of joy, and seeing her so lively and\r\napparently as well as ever, his face cleared, and the frown of anxiety\r\npassed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughter's own lips\r\nthat she had nothing the matter with her, and moreover was so delighted\r\nto see him that she was quite glad about the ghost, as it was the cause\r\nof bringing him home again.\r\n\r\n\"And how is the ghost getting on?\" he asked, turning to Miss\r\nRottermeyer, with a twinkle of amusement in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"It is no joke, I assure you,\" replied that lady. \"You will not laugh\r\nyourself tomorrow morning, Mr. Sesemann; what is going on in the house\r\npoints to some terrible thing that has taken place in the past and been\r\nconcealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know nothing about that,\" said the master of the house, \"but\r\nI must beg you not to bring suspicion on my worthy ancestors. And now\r\nwill you kindly call Sebastian into the dining-room, as I wish to speak\r\nto him alone.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had been quite aware that Sebastian and Miss Rottermeyer\r\nwere not on the best of terms, and he had his ideas about this scare.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, lad,\" he said as Sebastian appeared, \"and tell me\r\nfrankly--have you been playing at ghosts to amuse yourself at Miss\r\nRottermeyer's expense?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, on my honor, sir; pray, do not think it; I am very uncomfortable\r\nabout the matter myself,\" answered Sebastian with unmistakable\r\ntruthfulness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that is so, I will show you and John tomorrow morning how\r\nghosts look in the daylight. You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\r\nSebastian, a great strong lad like you, to run away from a ghost! But\r\nnow go and take a message to my old friend the doctor: give him my kind\r\nregards, and ask if he will come to me tonight at nine o'clock without\r\nfail; I have come by express from Paris to consult him. I shall want\r\nhim to spend the night here, so bad a case is it; so will he arrange\r\naccordingly. You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Sebastian, \"I will see to the matter as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nPunctually at nine o'clock, after the children and Miss Rottermeyer\r\nhad retired, the doctor arrived. He was a grey-haired man with a fresh\r\nface, and two bright, kindly eyes. He looked anxious as he walked in,\r\nbut, on catching sight of his patient, burst out laughing and clapped\r\nhim on the shoulder. \"Well,\" he said, \"you look pretty bad for a person\r\nthat I am to sit up with all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, friend,\" answered Mr. Sesemann, \"the one you have to sit up\r\nfor will look a good deal worse when we have once caught him, for there\r\nis a ghost in the house!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"That's a nice way of showing sympathy, doctor!\" continued Mr.\r\nSesemann. \"It's a pity my friend Rottermeyer cannot hear you. She is\r\nfirmly convinced that some old member of the family is wandering about\r\nthe house doing penance for some awful crime he committed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did she become acquainted with him?\" asked the doctor, still very\r\nmuch amused.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Sesemann recounted to him how the front door was nightly opened\r\nby somebody, according to the testimony of the combined household. The\r\nwhole thing was either a joke gotten up by some friend of the servants,\r\njust to alarm the household while he was away or else it was a thief,\r\nwho, by leading everybody at first to think there was a ghost, made it\r\nsafe for himself when he came later to steal, as no one would venture\r\nto run out if they heard him.\r\n\r\nThe two took up their quarters for the night in the same room in which\r\nSebastian and John had kept watch. The door was shut close to prevent\r\nthe light being seen in the hall outside, which might frighten away the\r\nghost. The gentlemen sat comfortably back in the arm-chairs and began\r\ntalking of all sorts of things, now and then pausing to take a good\r\ndraught of wine, and so twelve o'clock struck before they were aware.\r\n\r\n\"The ghost has got scent of us and is keeping away tonight,\" said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, it does not generally appear before one o'clock,\" answered\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nThey started talking again. One o'clock struck. There was not a sound\r\nabout the house, nor in the street outside. Suddenly the doctor lifted\r\nhis finger.\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Sesemann, don't you hear something?\"\r\n\r\nThey both listened, and they distinctly heard the bar softly pushed\r\naside and then the key turned in the lock and the door opened. Mr.\r\nSesemann put out his hand for his revolver.\r\n\r\n\"You are not afraid, are you?\" said the doctor as he stood up.\r\n\r\n\"It is better to take precautions,\" whispered Mr. Sesemann, and seizing\r\none of the lights in his other hand, he followed the doctor, who, armed\r\nin like manner with a light and a revolver, went softly on in front.\r\nThey stepped into the hall. The moonlight was shining in through the\r\nopen door and fell on a white figure standing motionless in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" thundered the doctor in a voice that echoed through\r\nthe hall, as the two men advanced with lights and weapons towards the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nIt turned and gave a low cry. There in her little white nightgown stood\r\nHeidi, with bare feet, staring with wild eyes at the lights and the\r\nrevolvers, and trembling from head to foot like a leaf in the wind. The\r\ntwo men looked at one another in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I believe it is Heidi,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Child, what does this mean?\" said Mr. Sesemann. \"What did you want?\r\nwhy did you come down here?\"\r\n\r\nWhite with terror, and hardly able to make her voice heard, Heidi\r\nanswered, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nBut now the doctor stepped forward. \"This is a matter for me to see to,\r\nSesemann; go back to your chair. I must take the child upstairs to her\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that he put down his revolver and gently taking the child by\r\nthe hand led her upstairs. \"Don't be frightened,\" he said as they went\r\nup side by side, \"it's nothing to be frightened about; it's all right,\r\nonly just go quietly.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching Heidi's room the doctor put the candle down on the table,\r\nand taking Heidi up in his arms laid her on the bed and carefully\r\ncovered her over. Then he sat down beside her and waited until she had\r\ngrown quieter and no longer trembled so violently. He then took her\r\nhand and said in a kind, soothing voice, \"There, now you feel better,\r\nand now tell me where you were wanting to go to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not want to go anywhere,\" said Heidi. \"I did not know I went\r\ndownstairs, but all at once I was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, and had you been dreaming, so that you seemed to see and hear\r\nsomething very distinctly?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOCTOR DISCOVERS HEIDI'S HOME-SICKNESS]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I dream every night, and always about the same things. I think\r\nI am back with grandfather, and I hear the sound in the fir trees\r\noutside, and I see the stars shining so brightly, and then I open the\r\ndoor quickly and run out, and it is all so beautiful! But when I wake I\r\nam still in Frankfurt.\" And Heidi struggled as she spoke to keep back\r\nthe sobs which seemed to choke her.\r\n\r\n\"And have you no pain anywhere? no pain in your head or back?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only a feeling as if there were a great stone weighing on me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if you had eaten something that would not go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not like that; something heavy as if I wanted to cry very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, and then do you have a good cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I mustn't; Miss Rottermeyer forbade me to cry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you swallow it all down, I suppose? Are you happy here in\r\nFrankfurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the low answer; but it sounded more like \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where did you live with your grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up on the mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't very amusing; rather dull at times, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!\" Heidi could go no further; the\r\nremembrance of the past, the excitement she had just gone through, the\r\nlong suppressed weeping, were too much for the child's strength; the\r\ntears began to fall fast, and she broke into violent weeping.\r\n\r\nThe doctor patted her head kindly. \"There, there, go on crying, it will\r\ndo you good, and then go to sleep: it will be all right tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left the room and went downstairs to Mr. Sesemann; when he was\r\nonce more sitting in the arm-chair opposite his friend, \"Sesemann,\" he\r\nsaid, \"let me first tell you that your little charge is a sleep-walker;\r\nshe is the ghost who has nightly opened the front door and put your\r\nhousehold into this fever of alarm. Secondly, the child is consumed\r\nwith home-sickness to such an extent that she is nearly a skeleton\r\nalready, and soon will be quite one; something must be done at once.\r\nThere is but one remedy and that is to send her back to her native\r\nmountain air. So tomorrow the child must start for home; there you have\r\nmy prescription.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had risen and now paced up and down the room in the\r\ngreatest state of concern.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, \"the child a sleep-walker and ill! All this has\r\ntaken place in my house and no one noticed it! And you mean, doctor,\r\nthat the child who came here happy and healthy, I am to send back to\r\nher grandfather a miserable little skeleton? I can't do it; you cannot\r\ndream of my doing such a thing! Take the child in hand, do with her\r\nwhat you will, and make her whole and sound, and then she shall go\r\nhome; but you must cure her first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sesemann,\" replied the doctor, \"this illness of the child's is not\r\none to be cured with pills and powders. The child has not a strong\r\nconstitution, but if you send her back at once she may recover in the\r\nmountain air, if not--you would rather she went back ill than not at\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann stood still; the doctor's words were a shock to him.\r\n\r\n\"If you put it so, doctor, there is assuredly only one way--and that is\r\nto send her home at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAT HOME AGAIN ON THE MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daylight Mr. Sesemann went quickly upstairs and along the passage to\r\nMiss Rottermeyer's room, and there gave such an unusually loud knock at\r\nthe door that the lady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm. She heard\r\nthe master of the house calling to her from the other side of the door,\r\n\"Please make haste and come down to the dining-room; we must make ready\r\nfor a journey at once.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rottermeyer came down, with everything well adjusted about\r\nher except her cap, which was put on hind side before, Mr. Sesemann\r\nbegan without delay to give her directions. She was to get out a\r\ntrunk and pack up all the things belonging to Heidi, and a good part\r\nof Clara's clothes as well, so that the child might take home proper\r\napparel.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottermeyer stood as if rooted to the spot and stared in\r\nastonishment at Mr. Sesemann. She had quite expected a long private\r\naccount of some terrible ghostly experience of his during the night.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and left her\r\nstanding there while he went to speak to Clara. He told her everything\r\nthat had occurred during the past night, and explained how Heidi's\r\nnightly wanderings might gradually lead her farther and farther,\r\nperhaps even on to the roof, which of course would be very dangerous\r\nfor her. And so they had decided to send her home at once, as he did\r\nnot like to take the responsibility of her remaining, and Clara would\r\nsee for herself that it was the only thing to do. Clara was very much\r\ndistressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions for keeping\r\nHeidi with her; but her father was firm, and promised her, if she would\r\nbe reasonable and make no further fuss, that he would take her to\r\nSwitzerland next summer.\r\n\r\nNext he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready to start: he was\r\nto travel with Heidi as far as Basle that day, and the next day take\r\nher home. He would give him a letter to carry to the grandfather, which\r\nwould explain everything, and he could then return to Frankfurt.\r\n\r\n\"But there is one thing in particular which I wish you to look after,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Sesemann in conclusion. \"When you reach the hotel, go at once\r\ninto the child's room and see that the windows are all firmly fastened\r\nso that they cannot be easily opened. After Heidi is in bed, lock the\r\ndoor of her room on the outside, for the child walks in her sleep\r\nand might run into danger in a strange house if she went wandering\r\ndownstairs and tried to open the front door; so you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then that was it?\" exclaimed Sebastian, for now a light was thrown\r\non the ghostly visitations.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was it! and you are a coward, and you may tell John he is\r\nthe same, and the whole household a pack of idiots.\" And with this Mr.\r\nSesemann went off to his study to write a letter to Alm-Uncle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Heidi was standing expectantly dressed in her Sunday frock\r\nwaiting to see what would happen next, for Tinette had awakened her\r\nwith a shake and put on her clothes without a word of explanation. The\r\nlittle uneducated child was far too much beneath her for Tinette to\r\nspeak to.\r\n\r\nWhen she appeared at the breakfast table, Mr. Sesemann said: \"You are\r\ngoing home today, little one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home?\" murmured Heidi in a low voice, turning pale; she was so\r\novercome that for a moment or two she could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to hear more about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with delight.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" said Mr. Sesemann as he sat down and made her a sign\r\nto do the same, \"but now eat a good breakfast, and then off you go in\r\nthe carriage.\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to do what she\r\nwas told; she was in such a state of excitement that she hardly knew if\r\nshe was awake or dreaming, or if she would again open her eyes to find\r\nherself in her nightgown at the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him,\" Mr. Sesemann\r\ncalled out to Miss Rottermeyer, who just then came into the room;\r\n\"the child can't eat anything now, which is quite natural. Now run up\r\nto Clara and stay with her till the carriage comes round,\" he added\r\nkindly, turning to Heidi.\r\n\r\nHeidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs. An immense\r\ntrunk was standing open in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Heidi,\" cried Clara, as she entered; \"see all the things I have had\r\nput in for you--aren't you pleased?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and\r\nhandkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. \"And look here,\" she\r\nadded, as she triumphantly held up a basket. Heidi peeped in and jumped\r\nfor joy, for inside it were twelve beautiful round white rolls, all for\r\ngrandmother. In their delight the children forgot that the time had\r\ncome for them to separate, and when some one called out, \"The carriage\r\nis here,\" there was no time for grieving.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew no one could\r\nhave packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for she had kept it by\r\nher night and day. This was put in the basket with the rolls. Then she\r\nopened her wardrobe to look for another treasure--the old red shawl\r\nwhich had been left behind. Heidi wrapped it round her old hat and\r\nlaid it on the top of the basket, so that the red package was quite\r\nconspicuous. Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room. Miss\r\nRottermeyer was waiting at the top of the stairs to say good-bye to\r\nher. When she caught sight of the strange little red bundle, she took\r\nit out of the basket and threw it on the ground. \"No, no, Adelaide,\"\r\nshe exclaimed, \"you cannot leave the house with that thing. What can\r\nyou possibly want with it!\" Heidi did not dare take up her little\r\nbundle, but she gave the master of the house an imploring look, as if\r\nher greatest treasure had been taken from her.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Sesemann in a very decided voice, \"the child\r\nshall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens and tortoises,\r\nif it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out about that, Miss\r\nRottermeyer.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy and gratitude.\r\nAs she stood by the carriage door, Mr. Sesemann gave her his hand\r\nand said he hoped she would remember him and Clara. He wished her a\r\nhappy journey, and Heidi thanked him for all his kindness, and added,\r\n\"And please say good-bye to the doctor for me and give him many, many\r\nthanks.\" For she had not forgotten that he had said to her the night\r\nbefore, 'It will be all right tomorrow,' and she rightly divined that\r\nhe had helped to make it so for her. Heidi was now lifted into the\r\ncarriage, and then the basket and the provisions were put in, and\r\nfinally Sebastian took his place. Then Mr. Sesemann called out once\r\nmore, \"A pleasant journey to you,\" and the carriage rolled away.\r\n\r\nHeidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage, holding her basket\r\ntightly on her lap; she would not let it out of her hands for a\r\nmoment, for it contained the delicious rolls for grandmother; so she\r\nmust keep it carefully, and even peep inside it from time to time to\r\nenjoy the sight of them. For many hours she sat as still as a mouse;\r\nonly now was she beginning to realize that she was going home to the\r\ngrandfather, the mountain, the grandmother, and Peter. All of a sudden\r\nshe said anxiously, \"Sebastian, are you sure that grandmother on the\r\nmountain is not dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Sebastian, wishing to soothe her, \"we will hope not; she\r\nis sure to be alive still.\"\r\n\r\nThen Heidi fell back on her own thoughts again. Now and then she looked\r\ninside the basket, for the thing she looked forward to most was laying\r\nall the rolls out on grandmother's table. After a long silence she\r\nspoke again, \"If only we could know for certain that grandmother is\r\nalive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Sebastian half asleep, \"she is sure to be alive, there\r\nis no reason why she should be dead.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while sleep came to Heidi too, and after her disturbed night\r\nand early rising she slept so soundly that she did not wake till\r\nSebastian shook her by the arm and called to her, \"Wake up, wake up! we\r\nshall have to get out directly; we are just in Basle!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a further railway journey of many hours the next day. Heidi\r\nagain sat with her basket on her knee, for she would not have given\r\nit up to Sebastian on any consideration; today she never even opened\r\nher mouth, for her excitement, which increased with every mile of the\r\njourney, kept her speechless. All of a sudden, before Heidi expected\r\nit, a voice called out, \"Mayenfeld.\" She and Sebastian both jumped\r\nup, the latter also taken by surprise. In another minute they were\r\nboth standing on the platform with Heidi's trunk, and the train was\r\nsteaming away down the valley. Sebastian looked after it regretfully,\r\nfor he preferred the easier mode of travelling to a wearisome climb on\r\nfoot, especially as there was danger no doubt as well as fatigue in a\r\ncountry like this, where, according to Sebastian's idea, everything and\r\neverybody were half savage. He therefore looked cautiously to either\r\nside to see who was a likely person to ask the safest way to Doerfli.\r\n\r\nJust outside the station he saw a shabby-looking little cart and horse\r\nwhich a broad-shouldered man was loading with heavy sacks that had been\r\nbrought by the train, so he went up to him and asked which was the\r\nsafest way to get to Doerfli.\r\n\r\n\"All the roads about here are safe,\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\nSo Sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best way\r\nto avoid falling over the precipice, and also how a trunk could be\r\nconveyed to Doerfli. The man looked at it, weighing it with his eye,\r\nand then volunteered if it was not too heavy to take it on his own\r\ncart, as he was driving to Doerfli. After some little interchange of\r\nwords it was finally agreed that the man should take both the child and\r\nthe trunk to Doerfli, and there find some one who could be sent on with\r\nHeidi up the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"I can go by myself, I know the way well from Doerfli,\" put in Heidi,\r\nwho had been listening attentively to the conversation. Sebastian was\r\ngreatly relieved at not having to do any mountain climbing. He drew\r\nHeidi aside and gave her a thick rolled parcel, and a letter for her\r\ngrandfather; the parcel, he told her, was a present from Mr. Sesemann,\r\nand she must put it at the bottom of her basket under the rolls and be\r\nvery careful not to lose it, as Mr. Sesemann would be very vexed if she\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be sure not to lose it,\" said Heidi confidently, and she at\r\nonce put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her basket. The trunk\r\nmeanwhile had been hoisted into the cart, and now Sebastian lifted\r\nHeidi and her basket on to the high seat and shook hands with her. The\r\ndriver swung himself up beside Heidi, and the cart rolled away in the\r\ndirection, of the mountains, while Sebastian, glad of having no tiring\r\nand dangerous journey on foot before him, sat down in the station and\r\nawaited the return train.\r\n\r\nThe driver of the cart was the miller at Doerfli and was taking home\r\nhis sacks of flour. He had never seen Heidi, but like everybody in\r\nDoerfli knew all about her. He had known her parents, and felt sure at\r\nonce that this was the child of whom he had heard so much. He began\r\nto wonder why she had come back, and as they drove along he entered\r\ninto conversation with her. \"You are the child who lived with your\r\ngrandfather, Alm-Uncle, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they treat you well down there that you have come back so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice as it could\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why are you running home again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only because Mr. Sesemann gave me leave, or else I should not have\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they were willing to let you stay, why did you not remain where you\r\nwere better off than at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I would a thousand times rather be with grandfather on the\r\nmountain than anywhere else in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will think differently perhaps when you get back there,\" grumbled\r\nthe miller; and then to himself, \"It's strange of her, for she must\r\nknow what it's like.\"\r\n\r\nHe began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked around her and\r\nbegan to tremble with excitement, for she knew every tree along the\r\nway, and there overhead were the high jagged peaks of the mountain\r\nlooking down on her like old friends. She nodded back to them, and\r\ngrew every moment more wild with her joy and longing, feeling as if\r\nshe must jump down from the cart and run with all her might till\r\nshe reached the top. The clock was striking five as they drove into\r\nDoerfli. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she said hastily, \"Thank you,\r\ngrandfather will send for the trunk.\"\r\n\r\nShe climbed up the steep path from Doerfli as quickly as she could; she\r\nwas obliged, however, to pause now and again to take breath, for the\r\nbasket she carried was rather heavy, and the way got steeper as she\r\ndrew nearer the top. One thought alone filled Heidi's mind, \"Would she\r\nfind the grandmother sitting in her usual corner by the spinning-wheel,\r\nwas she still alive?\" At last Heidi caught sight of the grandmother's\r\nhouse in the hollow of the mountain and her heart began to beat; she\r\nran faster and faster and her heart beat louder and louder--and now she\r\nhad reached the house, but she trembled so she could hardly open the\r\ndoor--and then she was standing inside, unable in her breathlessness to\r\nutter a sound.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my God!\" cried a voice from the corner, \"that was how Heidi used\r\nto run in; if only I could have her with me once again! Who is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's I, I, Grandmother,\" cried Heidi as she ran and flung herself on\r\nher knees beside the old woman, and seizing her hands, clung to her,\r\nunable to speak for joy. And the grandmother herself could not say\r\na word for some time, so unexpected was this happiness; but at last\r\nshe put out her hand and stroked Heidi's curly hair, and said, \"Yes,\r\nyes, that is her hair, and her voice; thank God that He has granted my\r\nprayer!\" And tears of joy fell from the blind eyes on to Heidi's hand.\r\n\"Is it really you, Heidi; have you really come back to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Grandmother, I am really here,\" answered Heidi in a reassuring\r\nvoice. \"Do not cry, for I have really come back and I am never going\r\naway again, and I shall come every day to see you, and you won't have\r\nany more hard bread to eat for some days, for look, look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Heidi took the rolls from the basket, and piled the whole twelve up\r\non grandmother's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, child! child! what a blessing you bring with you!\" the old woman\r\nexclaimed, as she felt and seemed never to come to the end of the\r\nrolls. \"But you yourself are the greatest blessing.\"\r\n\r\nThen Heidi told her how unhappy she had been, thinking that the\r\ngrandmother might die while she was away and would never have her white\r\nrolls, and that then she would never, never see her again.\r\n\r\nPeter's mother came in and stood for a moment overcome with\r\nastonishment. \"Why, it's Heidi,\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHeidi stood up, and Brigitta could not say enough in her admiration\r\nof the child's dress and appearance; she walked round her, exclaiming\r\nall the while, \"Grandmother, if you could only see her, and see what a\r\npretty frock she has on; you would hardly know her again. And the hat\r\nwith the feather in it is yours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may\r\nsee how you look in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I would rather not,\" replied Heidi firmly. \"You can have it if\r\nyou like; I do not want it; I have my own still.\" And Heidi so saying\r\nundid her red bundle and took out her own hat, which had become a\r\nlittle more battered still during the journey. She had not forgotten\r\nhow her grandfather had called out to Dete that he never wished to see\r\nher and her hat and feathers again, and this was the reason she had\r\nso anxiously preserved her old hat, for she had never ceased to think\r\nabout going home to her grandfather. Next she took off her pretty dress\r\nand put her red shawl on over her underpetticoat, which left her arms\r\nbare. \"I must go home to grandfather now,\" she said, \"but tomorrow I\r\nshall come again. Good-night, Grandmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, come again, be sure you come again tomorrow,\" begged the\r\ngrandmother, as she pressed Heidi's hands in hers, unwilling to let her\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you taken off that pretty dress,\" asked Brigitta.\r\n\r\n\"Because I would rather go home to grandfather as I am, or else perhaps\r\nhe would not know me; you hardly did at first.\"\r\n\r\nBrigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a\r\nmysterious voice, \"You must be careful, for Peter tells me that\r\nAlm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never speaks.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the mountain, her\r\nbasket on her arm.\r\n\r\nSoon she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees above the hut\r\nroof, then the roof itself, and at last the whole hut, and there was\r\ngrandfather sitting as in old days smoking his pipe, and she could see\r\nthe fir trees waving in the wind. Quicker and quicker went her little\r\nfeet, and before Alm-Uncle had time to see who was coming, Heidi had\r\nrushed up to him, thrown down her basket and flung her arms round his\r\nneck, unable in the excitement of seeing him again to say more than\r\n\"Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!\" over and over again.\r\n\r\nAnd the old man himself said nothing. For the first time for many years\r\nhis eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand across them. Then he\r\nunloosed Heidi's arms, put her on his knee, and after looking at her\r\nfor a moment, \"So you have come back to me, Heidi,\" he said, \"how is\r\nthat? You don't look much of a grand lady. Did they send you away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Grandfather,\" said Heidi eagerly, \"you must not think that;\r\nthey were all so kind--Clara, and grandmamma, and Mr. Sesemann. But\r\nyou see, Grandfather, I used to think I should die, for I felt as if I\r\ncould not breathe; but I never said anything because it would have been\r\nungrateful. And then suddenly one morning quite early Mr. Sesemann said\r\nto me--but I think it was partly the doctor's doing--but perhaps it's\r\nall in the letter--\" and Heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the\r\nletter and handed them both to her grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"That belongs to you,\" he said, laying the roll of money down on the\r\nbench beside him. Then he opened the letter, read it through, and\r\nwithout a word put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?\" he asked,\r\ntaking the child by the hand to go into the hut. \"But bring your money\r\nwith you; you can buy a bed and bedclothes and dresses for a couple of\r\nyears with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I do not want it,\" replied Heidi. \"I have got a bed already,\r\nand Clara has put such a lot of clothes in my trunk that I shall never\r\nwant any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it and put it in the cupboard; you will want it some day I have\r\nno doubt.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the house;\r\nshe ran into all the corners, delighted to see everything again, and\r\nthen went up the ladder--but there she came to a pause and called down\r\nin a tone of surprise and distress, \"Oh, Grandfather, my bed's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can soon make it up again,\" he answered her from below. \"I did not\r\nknow that you were coming back; come along now and have your milk.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"OUR MILK TASTES NICER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE\r\nWORLD, GRANDFATHER\"]\r\n\r\nHeidi came down, sat herself on her high stool in the old place, and\r\nthen taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly, as if she had never\r\ncome across anything so delicious, and as she put down her bowl, she\r\nexclaimed, \"Our milk tastes nicer than anything else in the world,\r\nGrandfather.\"\r\n\r\nA shrill whistle was heard outside. Heidi darted out like a flash of\r\nlightning. There were the goats leaping and springing down the rocks,\r\nwith Peter in their midst. When he caught sight of Heidi he stood\r\nstill with astonishment and gazed speechlessly at her. Heidi called\r\nout, \"Good-evening, Peter,\" and then ran in among the goats. \"Little\r\nSwan! Little Bear! do you know me again?\" And the animals evidently\r\nrecognized her voice at once, for they began rubbing their heads\r\nagainst her and bleating loudly as if for joy, and as she called the\r\nother goats by name one after the other, they all came scampering\r\ntowards her helter-skelter and crowding round her. The impatient\r\nGreenfinch sprang into the air and over two of her companions in order\r\nto get nearer, and even the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk\r\nout of her way in quite a determined manner, which left him standing\r\ntaken aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in the air as much\r\nas to say, You see who I am.\r\n\r\n\"So you are back again?\" said Peter, at last, taking Heidi's hand which\r\nshe was holding out to him in greeting. \"I am glad you are back,\" he\r\nsaid, while his whole face beamed with pleasure, and then he prepared\r\nto go on with his goats; but he never had so much trouble with them\r\nbefore, for when at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got them all\r\ntogether, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of her\r\ngrandfather's two goats the whole flock suddenly turned and ran after\r\nher. Heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut the door,\r\nor Peter would never have got home that night. When she went indoors\r\nafter this she found her bed already made up for her. The grandfather\r\nhad carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets over the fragrant\r\nnew mown hay. It was with a happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that\r\nnight, and her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year\r\npast. The grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and\r\nmounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing no signs\r\nof restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed into the round\r\nwindow was keeping the moon from shining too brightly upon her. But\r\nHeidi did not stir; she had no need now to wander about, for the great\r\nburning longing of her heart was satisfied; she was at home again on\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE COAT WITH THE SILVER BUTTONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon Heidi was standing under the waving trees waiting\r\nfor her grandfather, who was going down with her to grandmother's, and\r\nthen on to Doerfli to fetch her trunk. She was longing to know how\r\ngrandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and hear\r\nher again. The grandfather came out, gave a look round, and then called\r\nto her in a cheerful voice, \"Well, now we can be off.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday, a day when Alm-Uncle made everything clean and tidy\r\ninside and outside the house; he had devoted the morning to this work\r\nso as to be able to accompany Heidi in the afternoon, and the whole\r\nplace was now as spick and span as he liked to see it. They parted at\r\nthe grandmother's cottage and Heidi ran in. The grandmother had heard\r\nher steps approaching and greeted her as she crossed the threshold, \"Is\r\nit you, child? have you come again?\"\r\n\r\nThen she took hold of Heidi's hand and held it fast in her own, for\r\nshe still seemed to fear that the child might be torn from her again.\r\nShe told Heidi how much she had enjoyed the white bread, and how much\r\nstronger she felt already for having been able to eat it, and then\r\nPeter's mother went on and said she was sure that if her mother could\r\neat like that for a week she would get back some of her strength.\r\n\r\n\"I know, Grandmother, what I will do,\" said Heidi eagerly, \"I will\r\nwrite to Clara, and she will send me as many rolls again, if not twice\r\nas many as you have already, for I had ever such a large heap in the\r\nwardrobe, and when they were all taken away she promised to give me as\r\nmany back, and she would do so I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a good idea,\" said Brigitta; \"but then, they would get hard\r\nand stale. The baker in Doerfli makes the white rolls, and if we could\r\nget some of those--but I can only just manage to pay for the black\r\nbread.\"\r\n\r\nA further bright thought came to Heidi, and with a look of joy, \"Oh, I\r\nhave lots of money, Grandmother,\" she cried gleefully, skipping about\r\nthe room in her delight, \"and I know now what I will do with it. You\r\nmust have a fresh white roll every day, and two on Sunday, and Peter\r\ncan bring them up from Doerfli.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, child!\" answered the grandmother, \"I cannot let you do that;\r\nthe money was not given to you for that purpose; you must give it to\r\nyour grandfather, and he will tell you how you are to spend it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions, and she\r\ncontinued to jump about, saying over and over again in a tone of\r\nexultation, \"Now, grandmother can have a roll every day and will grow\r\nquite strong again--and, Oh, Grandmother,\" she suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\"if you get strong everything will grow light again for you; perhaps\r\nit's only because you are weak that it is dark.\" The grandmother said\r\nnothing, she did not wish to spoil the child's pleasure. As she went\r\njumping about Heidi suddenly caught sight of the grandmother's song\r\nbook, and another happy idea struck her, \"Grandmother, I can also read\r\nnow, would you like me to read you one of your hymns from your old\r\nbook?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the grandmother, surprised and delighted; \"but can you\r\nreally read, child, really?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi climbed on a chair and lifted down the book, bringing a cloud of\r\ndust with it, for it had lain untouched on the shelf for a long time.\r\nShe wiped it off and sat herself down on a stool beside the old woman,\r\nand asked her which hymn she should read.\r\n\r\n\"What you like, child, what you like,\" and the grandmother pushed her\r\nspinning-wheel aside and sat in eager expectation waiting for Heidi to\r\nbegin. \"Here is one about the sun, Grandmother, I will read you that.\"\r\nAnd Heidi began, reading with more and more warmth of expression as she\r\nwent on,--\r\n\r\n           The morning breaks,\r\n           And warm and bright\r\n           The earth lies still\r\n           In the golden light--\r\n    For Dawn has scattered the clouds of night.\r\n\r\n           God's handiwork\r\n           Is seen around,\r\n           Things great and small\r\n           To His praise abound--\r\n    Where are the signs of His love not found?\r\n\r\n           Joy shall be ours\r\n           In that garden blest\r\n           Where after storm\r\n           We find our rest--\r\n    I wait in peace--God's time is best.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable joy\r\non her face, such as Heidi had never seen there before, although at the\r\nsame time the tears were running down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Heidi, that brings light to the heart! What comfort you have\r\nbrought me!\" And the old woman kept on repeating the glad words, while\r\nHeidi beamed with happiness.\r\n\r\nSome one now knocked at the window and Heidi looked up and saw her\r\ngrandfather beckoning her to come home with him. She promised the\r\ngrandmother before leaving her that she would be with her the next day,\r\nand even if she went out with Peter she would only spend half the day\r\nwith him, for the thought that she might make it light and happy again\r\nfor the grandmother gave her the greatest pleasure, greater even than\r\nbeing out on the sunny mountain with the flowers and goats. Heidi was\r\nso full of her morning's doings that she began at once to tell her\r\ngrandfather all about them: how the white bread could be brought every\r\nday from Doerfli if there was money for it, and how the grandmother had\r\nall at once grown stronger and happier, and light had come to her. \"If\r\nthe grandmother won't take the money, Grandfather, will you give it all\r\nto me, and I can then give Peter enough every day to buy a roll and two\r\non Sunday?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the bed?\" said her grandfather. \"It would be nice for\r\nyou to have a proper bed, and there would then be plenty for the bread.\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do what\r\nshe wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said, on her bed of\r\nhay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt. So at last he said,\r\n\"The money is yours, do what you like with it; you can buy bread for\r\ngrandmother for years to come with it.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother would never need\r\nto eat hard black bread any more, and \"Oh, Grandfather!\" she said,\r\n\"everything is happier now than it has ever been in our lives before!\"\r\nand she sang and skipped along, holding her grandfather's hand as\r\nlight-hearted as a bird. But all at once she grew quiet and said, \"If\r\nGod had let me come at once, as I prayed, then everything would have\r\nbeen different, I should only have had a little bread to bring to\r\ngrandmother, and I should not have been able to read, which is such a\r\ncomfort to her. So we will pray every day, won't we, Grandfather, and\r\nnever forgot Him again, or else He may forget us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And supposing one does forget Him?\" said the grandfather in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Then everything goes wrong, for God lets us then go where we like, and\r\nwhen we get poor and miserable and begin to cry about it no one pities\r\nus, but they say, You ran away from God, and so God, who could have\r\nhelped you, left you to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, Heidi; where did you learn that?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Grandmamma Sesemann; she explained it all to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather walked on for a little while without speaking, then he\r\nsaid, as if following his own train of thought: \"And if it once is so,\r\nit is so always; no one can go back, and he whom God has forgotten, is\r\nforgotten for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no Grandfather, we can go back, for grandmamma told me so, and so\r\nit was in the beautiful tale in my book--but you have not heard that\r\nyet; but we shall be home directly now and then I will read it you, and\r\nyou will see how beautiful it is.\" And in her eagerness Heidi struggled\r\nfaster and faster up the steep ascent, and they were no sooner at the\r\ntop than she let go her grandfather's hand and ran into the hut. The\r\ngrandfather slung the basket off his shoulders in which he had brought\r\nup a part of the contents of the trunk, which was too heavy to carry up\r\nas it was. Then he sat down on his seat and began thinking.\r\n\r\nHeidi soon came running out with her book under her arm and in a\r\nsympathetic voice began to read the story of the Prodigal Son.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that a beautiful tale, Grandfather,\" said Heidi, as the latter\r\ncontinued to sit without speaking, for she had expected him to express\r\npleasure and astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Heidi; it is a beautiful tale,\" he replied, but he\r\nlooked so grave as he said it that Heidi grew silent herself and sat\r\nlooking quietly at her pictures.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, as she lay fast asleep in her bed, the grandfather\r\nwent up the ladder and put his lamp down near her bed so that the\r\nlight fell on the sleeping child. Her hands were still folded as if\r\nshe had fallen asleep saying her prayers, an expression of peace and\r\ntrust lay on the little face, and something in it seemed to appeal to\r\nthe grandfather, for he stood a long time gazing down at her without\r\nspeaking. At last he too folded his hands, and with bowed head said in\r\na low voice, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before Thee and\r\nam not worthy to be called Thy son.\" And two large tears rolled down\r\nthe old man's cheeks.\r\n\r\nNext morning while the sound of a few early bells was ringing up from\r\nthe valley the grandfather called to Heidi to put on her best frock for\r\nthey were going to church together.\r\n\r\nShe was not long getting ready for it was an unusual summons from her\r\ngrandfather. She put on her smart Frankfurt dress and soon went down,\r\nbut when she saw her grandfather she stood still, gazing at him in\r\nastonishment. \"Why, Grandfather!\" she exclaimed, \"I never saw you look\r\nlike that before! and the coat, with the silver buttons! Oh, you do\r\nlook nice in your Sunday coat!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled and replied, \"And you too; now come along!\" He took\r\nHeidi's hand and together they walked down the mountain side. The bells\r\nwere ringing in every direction now, sounding louder and fuller as they\r\nneared the valley, and Heidi listened to them with delight. \"Hark,\r\nGrandfather! it's like a great festival!\"\r\n\r\nThe congregation had already assembled and the singing had begun when\r\nHeidi and her grandfather entered the church at Doerfli and sat down\r\nat the back. But before the hymn was over every one was nudging his\r\nneighbor and whispering, \"Do you see? Alm-Uncle is in church!\"\r\n\r\nSoon everybody in the church knew of Alm-Uncle's presence, and the\r\nwomen kept on turning round to look and quite lost their place in\r\nthe singing. At the close of the service Alm-Uncle took Heidi by the\r\nhand, and on leaving the church made his way towards the pastor's\r\nhouse; the rest of the congregation looked curiously after him, some\r\neven following to see whether he went inside the pastor's house, which\r\nhe did. Then they collected in groups and talked over this strange\r\nevent, keeping their eyes on the pastor's door, watching to see\r\nwhether Alm-Uncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome, or as if the\r\ninterview had been a peaceful one, for they could not imagine what had\r\nbrought the old man down, and what it all meant. Some, however, adopted\r\na new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm-Uncle was not so bad\r\nafter all as they thought, \"for see how carefully he took the little\r\none by the hand.\" And others responded and said they had always thought\r\npeople had exaggerated about him, that if he was so downright bad he\r\nwould be afraid to go inside the pastor's house.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Alm-Uncle had gone into the pastor's house and knocked at the\r\nstudy door. The pastor came out and shook hands warmly with him, and\r\nAlm-Uncle was unable at first to speak, for he had not expected such\r\na friendly reception. At last he collected himself and said, \"I have\r\ncome to ask you, pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you\r\ncalled on me, and to beg you not to owe me ill-will for having been so\r\nobstinately set against your well-meant advice. You were right, and I\r\nwas wrong, but I have now made up my mind to follow your advice and to\r\nfind a place for myself at Doerfli for the winter, for the child is not\r\nstrong enough to stand the bitter cold up on the mountain. And if the\r\npeople down here look askance at me, as at a person not to be trusted,\r\nI know it is my own fault.\"\r\n\r\nThe pastor's kindly eyes shone with pleasure. He pressed the old\r\nman's hand in his, and said with emotion, \"Neighbor, I am greatly\r\nrejoiced. You will not repent coming to live with us again; as for\r\nmyself you will always be welcome as a dear friend and neighbor, and I\r\nlook forward to our spending many a pleasant winter evening together\r\nand we will find some nice friends too for the little one.\" And the\r\npastor laid his hand kindly on the child's curly head and took her by\r\nthe hand as he walked to the door with the old man. He did not say\r\ngood-bye to him till they were standing outside, so that all the people\r\nloitering about saw him shake hands as if parting reluctantly from\r\nhis best friend. The door had hardly shut behind him before the whole\r\ncongregation now came forward to greet Alm-Uncle, every one striving to\r\nbe the first to shake hands with him. Most of his friends accompanied\r\nhim and Heidi some way up the mountain, and each as they bid him\r\ngood-bye made him promise that when he next came down he would without\r\nfail come and call. As the old man at last stood alone with the child,\r\nwatching their retreating figures, there was a light upon his face as\r\nif reflected from some inner sunshine of heart. Heidi looking up at him\r\nwith her clear, steady eyes, said, \"Grandfather, you look nicer and\r\nnicer today, I never saw you quite like that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so,\" he answered with a smile. \"Well, yes, Heidi, I am\r\nhappier today than I deserve, happier than I had thought possible; it\r\nis good to be at peace with God and man! God was good to me when he\r\nsent you to my hut.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Peter's home the grandfather opened the door and\r\nwalked straight in. \"Good-morning, Grandmother,\" he said, \"I think we\r\nshall have to do some more patching up before the autumn winds come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it is not Uncle!\" cried the grandmother in pleased surprise.\r\n\"That I should live to see such a thing! and now I can thank you for\r\nall that you have done for me. May God reward you! may God reward you!\"\r\nShe stretched out a trembling hand to him, and the grandfather shook\r\nit warmly.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Peter rushed in, evidently in a great hurry, knocking\r\nhis head violently against the door in his haste, so that everything in\r\nthe room rattled. Gasping and breathless he stood still after this and\r\nheld out a letter. This was another great event, for such a thing had\r\nnever happened before; the letter was addressed to Heidi and had been\r\ndelivered at the post-office in Doerfli. They all sat down round the\r\ntable to hear what was in it, for Heidi opened it at once and read it\r\nwithout hesitation. The letter was from Clara, who wrote that the house\r\nhad been so dull since Heidi left that she did not know what to do, and\r\nshe had at last persuaded her father to take her to the baths at Ragatz\r\nin the coming autumn; grandmamma had arranged to join them there, and\r\nthey both were looking forward to paying her and her grandfather a\r\nvisit. And grandmamma sent a further message to Heidi which was that\r\nthe latter had done quite right to take the rolls to the grandmother,\r\nand so that she might not have to eat them dry, she was sending some\r\ncoffee, which was already on its way, and grandmamma hoped when she\r\ncame to the Alm in the autumn that Heidi would take her to see her old\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThere were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment on hearing this\r\nnews and the afternoon soon passed in discussing plans for the coming\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThen the old man and Heidi started back up the mountain, promising\r\nthe grandmother that they would come again next day. As they had\r\nbeen greeted with the bells when they made their journey down in the\r\nmorning, so now they were accompanied by the peaceful evening chimes as\r\nthey climbed to the hut, which had quite a Sunday-like appearance as it\r\nstood bathed in the light of the low evening sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Autumn came Clara was not so well and the doctor advised Mr.\r\nSesemann to postpone the visit to Heidi till the following spring.\r\n\r\n\"I know how you hate to deny your child anything and especially this\r\ntrip that she has so set her heart upon,\" said the kind-hearted old\r\ndoctor, \"but you must make up your mind to it, Sesemann. Clara has\r\nnot had such a bad summer as this last one, for years. Only the worst\r\nresults would follow from the fatigue of such a journey, and it is\r\nout of the question for her. If we want to give the child a chance of\r\nrecovery we must use the utmost care and watchfulness.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann, who had listened to the doctor in sad and submissive\r\nsilence, now suddenly jumped up. \"Doctor,\" he said, \"tell me truly:\r\nhave you really any hope for her final recovery?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Very little,\" he replied quietly.\r\n\"But, friend, think of my trouble. You still have a beloved child to\r\nlook for you and greet you on your return home. You do not come back to\r\nan empty house and sit down to a solitary meal.\"\r\n\r\nThe once bright and cheery doctor was now a broken-hearted man. He\r\ncould not get over the loss of his daughter who had died some months\r\nbefore, and who had been his sole and constant companion for many years.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann, who had been striding up and down the room, suddenly\r\npaused beside his friend and laying his hand on his shoulder said:\r\n\"Doctor, I have an idea. How would it be for you to go, and pay Heidi a\r\nvisit in our name? You need a change of scene. I cannot bear to see you\r\nso sad; you are no longer the same man.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and wanted to make\r\nobjections, but his friend gave him no time to say anything. He was\r\nso delighted with his idea, that he seized the doctor by the arm and\r\ndrew him into Clara's room. She held out her hand to him as he came\r\nup to her; he took a seat beside her, and her father also drew up his\r\nchair, and taking Clara's hand in his began to talk to her of the\r\nSwiss journey and how he himself had looked forward to it. He passed\r\nas quickly as he could over the main point that it was now impossible\r\nfor her to undertake it, for he dreaded the tears that would follow;\r\nbut he went on without pause to tell her of his new plan, and dwelt on\r\nthe great benefit it would be to his friend if he could be persuaded to\r\ntake this holiday.\r\n\r\nThe tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes, although Clara\r\nstruggled to keep them down for her father's sake, but it was a\r\nbitter disappointment to give up the journey, the thought of which\r\nhad been her only joy and solace during the lonely hours of her long\r\nillness. She knew, however, that her father would never refuse her a\r\nthing unless he was certain that it would be harmful for her. So she\r\nswallowed her tears as well as she could and turned her thoughts to the\r\none hope still left her. Taking the doctor's hand and stroking it, she\r\nsaid pleadingly,--\r\n\r\n\"Dear doctor, you will go and see Heidi, won't you? and then you can\r\ncome and tell me all about it, what it is like up there, and what Heidi\r\nand the grandfather, and Peter and the goats do all day. I know them\r\nall so well! And then you can take what I want to send to Heidi; I have\r\nthought about it all, and also something for the grandmother. Do pray\r\ngo, dear doctor, and I will take as much cod liver oil as you like.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this promise finally decided the doctor it is impossible to\r\nsay, but it is certain that he smiled and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Then I must certainly go, Clara, for you will then get as plump and\r\nstrong as your father and I wish to see you. And have you decided when\r\nI am to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow morning--early if possible,\" replied Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is right,\" put in Mr. Sesemann, \"the sun is shining and the\r\nsky is blue, and there is no time to be lost; it is a pity to miss a\r\nsingle one of these days on the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor could not help laughing. \"You will be reproaching me next\r\nfor not being there already; well I must go and make arrangements for\r\ngetting off.\"\r\n\r\nBut Clara would not let him go until she had given him endless messages\r\nfor Heidi, and had explained all he was to look at so as to give her an\r\nexact description on his return. She would pack the presents she had\r\nalready bought, and send them to his house later.\r\n\r\nThe doctor promised to obey Clara's directions in every particular;\r\nhe would start some time during the following day if not the first\r\nthing in the morning, and would bring back a faithful account of his\r\nexperiences and of all he saw and heard.\r\n\r\nHe was hastening off when he met Miss Rottermeyer just returning from a\r\nwalk. He informed her of his intended journey, begging her in his most\r\nconciliatory voice to pack up the parcels for Heidi as she alone knew\r\nhow to pack. And then he took his leave.\r\n\r\nClara quite expected to have a long tussle with Miss Rottermeyer\r\nbefore she would get the latter to consent to sending all the things\r\nthat she had collected as presents for Heidi. But this time she was\r\nmistaken, for Miss Rottermeyer was in a more than usually good temper.\r\nShe cleared the large table so that all the things for Heidi could be\r\nspread out upon it and packed under Clara's own eyes. It was no light\r\njob, for the presents were of all shapes and sizes. First there was\r\nthe little warm cloak with a hood, which had been designed by Clara\r\nherself, in order that Heidi during the coming winter might be able\r\nto go and see grandmother when she liked, and not have to wait till\r\nher grandfather could take her wrapped up in a sack to keep her from\r\nfreezing. Then came a thick warm shawl for the grandmother, in which\r\nshe could wrap herself well up and not feel the cold when the wind\r\ncame sweeping in such terrible gusts round the house. The next object\r\nwas the large box full of cakes; these were also for the grandmother,\r\nthat she might have something to eat with her coffee besides bread.\r\nAn immense sausage was the next article; this had been originally\r\nintended for Peter, who never had anything but bread and cheese, but\r\nClara had altered her mind, fearing that in his delight he might eat\r\nit all up at once and make himself ill. So she arranged to send it\r\nto Brigitta, who could take some for herself and the grandmother and\r\ngive Peter his portion out by degrees. A packet of tobacco was a\r\npresent for grandfather, who was so fond of his pipe as he sat resting\r\nin the evening. Finally there was a whole lot of mysterious little\r\nbags, and parcels, and boxes, which Clara had had especial pleasure in\r\ncollecting, as each was to be a joyful surprise for Heidi as she opened\r\nit. The work came to an end at last, and Clara eyed the big box with\r\npleasure, picturing Heidi's exclamations and jumps of joy and surprise\r\nwhen the huge parcel arrived at the hut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSebastian came in, and lifting the package on to his shoulder, carried\r\nit off to be forwarded at once to the doctor's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR COMES WITH PRESENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains, and a fresh\r\nbreeze rustled through the fir trees and set their ancient branches\r\nwaving to and fro. The sound awoke Heidi and she jumped out of bed and\r\ndressed herself as quickly as she could.\r\n\r\nWhen she went down her ladder she found her grandfather had already\r\nleft the hut. He was standing outside looking at the sky and examining\r\nthe landscape as he did every morning, to see what sort of weather it\r\nwas going to be.\r\n\r\nLittle pink clouds were floating over the sky, that was growing\r\nbrighter and bluer with every minute, while the heights and the meadow\r\nlands were turning gold under the rising sun, which was just appearing\r\nabove the topmost peaks.\r\n\r\n\"O, how beautiful! how beautiful! Good-morning, Grandfather!\" cried\r\nHeidi, running out.\r\n\r\n\"What, you are awake already, are you?\" he answered, giving her a\r\nmorning greeting.\r\n\r\nThen Heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound she loved so\r\nwell, and with every fresh gust of wind which came roaring through\r\ntheir branches she gave a fresh jump and cry of delight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats; this done he\r\nbrushed and washed them, ready for their mountain excursion, and\r\nbrought them out of their shed. As soon as Heidi caught sight of them\r\nshe ran and embraced them, and they bleated in return, while they\r\nvied with each other in showing their affection by poking their heads\r\nagainst her and trying which could get nearest her. When the lively\r\nLittle Bear gave rather too violent a thrust, she only said, \"No,\r\nLittle Bear, you are pushing like the Great Turk,\" and Little Bear\r\nimmediately drew back his head and left off his rough attentions, while\r\nLittle Swan lifted her head and put on an expression as much as to say,\r\n\"No one shall ever accuse me of behaving like the Great Turk.\"\r\n\r\nPeter's whistle was heard and all the goats came along, leaping and\r\nspringing, and Heidi soon found herself surrounded by the whole flock,\r\npushed this way and that by their obstreperous greetings, but at last\r\nshe managed to get through them to where Snowflake was standing, for\r\nthe young goat had in vain striven to reach her.\r\n\r\nPeter now gave a last tremendous whistle, in order to startle the goats\r\nand drive them off, for he wanted to get near himself to say something\r\nto Heidi. The goats sprang aside and he came up to her.\r\n\r\n\"Can you come out with me today?\" he asked, evidently unwilling to hear\r\nher refuse.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I cannot, Peter,\" she answered. \"I am expecting them every\r\nminute from Frankfurt, and I must be at home when they come.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have said the same thing for days now,\" grumbled Peter.\r\n\r\n\"I must continue to say it till they come,\" replied Heidi. \"How can you\r\nthink, Peter, that I would be away when they came? As if I could do\r\nsuch a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"They would find Uncle at home,\" he answered with a snarling voice.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the grandfather's stentorian voice was heard.\r\n\"Why is the army not marching forward? Is it the field-marshal who is\r\nmissing or some of the troops?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Peter turned and went off, swinging his stick round so that\r\nit whistled through the air, and the goats, who understood the signal,\r\nstarted at full trot for their mountain pasture, Peter following in\r\ntheir wake.\r\n\r\nSince Heidi had come back to her grandfather she had learned to do many\r\nthings about the house. She put her bed in order every morning, patting\r\nand stroking it till she had got it perfectly smooth and flat. Then she\r\nwent about the room downstairs, put each chair back in its place, and\r\nif she found anything lying about she put it in the cupboard. After\r\nthat she fetched a duster, climbed on a chair, and rubbed the table\r\ntill it shone again. When the grandfather came in later he would look\r\nround well pleased and say to himself, \"We look like Sunday every day\r\nnow; Heidi did not go abroad for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Peter had departed and she and her grandfather had breakfasted,\r\nHeidi began her daily work as usual, but she did not get on with it\r\nvery fast. It was so lovely out of doors today, and every minute\r\nsomething happened to interrupt her in her work. Now it was a bright\r\nbeam of sun shining cheerfully through the open window, and seeming\r\nto say, \"Come out, Heidi, come out!\" Heidi felt she could not stay\r\nindoors, and she ran out in answer to the call. The sunlight lay\r\nsparkling on everything around the hut and on all the mountains and\r\nfar away along the valley, and the grass slope looked so golden and\r\ninviting that she was obliged to sit down for a few minutes and look\r\nabout her. Then she suddenly remembered that her stool was left\r\nstanding in the middle of the floor and that the table had not been\r\nrubbed, and she jumped up and ran inside again. But it was not long\r\nbefore the fir trees began their old song; Heidi felt it in all her\r\nlimbs, and again the desire to run outside was irresistible, and\r\nshe was off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches. The\r\ngrandfather, who was busy in his work-shed, stepped out from time to\r\ntime smiling to watch her at her gambols. He had just gone back to his\r\nwork on one of these occasions when Heidi called out, \"Grandfather!\r\nGrandfather! Come, come!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped quickly out, almost afraid something had happened to\r\nthe child, but he saw her running towards where the mountain path\r\ndescended, crying, \"They are coming! they are coming! and the doctor is\r\nin front of them!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend, who held out his\r\nhands in greeting to her. When she came up to him she clung to his\r\noutstretched arm, and exclaimed in the joy of her heart, \"Good-morning,\r\ndoctor, and thank you ever so many times.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, child! what have you got to thank me for?\" asked the\r\ndoctor, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"For being at home again with grandfather,\" the child explained.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine had passed\r\nacross it; he had not expected such a reception as this. He had\r\nquite thought that Heidi would have forgotten him; she had seen so\r\nlittle of him, and he had felt rather like one bearing a message of\r\ndisappointment. But instead, here was Heidi, her eyes dancing for joy,\r\nand full of gratitude and affection, clinging to the arm of her kind\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nHe took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness. \"Take me now to your\r\ngrandfather, Heidi, and show me where you live.\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi still remained standing looking down the path with a\r\nquestioning gaze. \"Where are Clara and grandmother?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now I have to tell you something which you will be as sorry about\r\nas I am,\" answered the doctor. \"You see, Heidi, I have come alone.\r\nClara was very ill and could not travel, and so the grandmother stayed\r\nbehind too. But next spring, when the days grow warm and long again,\r\nthey are coming here for certain.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi stood motionless for a second or two, overcome by the unexpected\r\ndisappointment. She suddenly remembered that the doctor had really come\r\nanyway. She lifted her eyes and saw the sad expression in his as he\r\nlooked down at her; she had never seen him with that look on his face\r\nwhen she was in Frankfurt. It went to Heidi's heart; she could not bear\r\nto see anybody unhappy, especially her dear doctor. No doubt it was\r\nbecause Clara and grandmother could not come, and so she began to think\r\nhow best she might console him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it won't be very long to wait for spring, and then they will\r\nbe sure to come,\" she said in a reassuring voice. \"Time passes very\r\nquickly with us, and then they will be able to stay longer when they\r\nare here, and Clara will be pleased at that. Now let us go and find\r\ngrandfather.\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut. She was so\r\nanxious to make the doctor happy again that she began once more\r\nassuring him that the winter passed quickly on the mountain and that\r\nsummer would be back again before they knew it, and she became so\r\nconvinced of the truth of her own words that she called out quite\r\ncheerfully to her grandfather as they approached, \"They have not come\r\ntoday, but they will be here in a very short time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE FIR TREES BEGAN\r\nTHEIR OLD SONG]\r\n\r\nThe doctor was no stranger to the grandfather, for the child had talked\r\nto him so much about her friend. The old man held out his hand to his\r\nguest in friendly greeting. Then the two men sat down in front of the\r\nhut. The doctor whispered to Heidi that there was something being\r\nbrought up the mountain which had traveled with him from Frankfurt,\r\nand which would give her even more pleasure than seeing him. Heidi\r\ngot into a great state of excitement on hearing this, wondering what\r\nit could be. The old man urged the doctor to spend as many of the\r\nbeautiful autumn days on the mountain as he could, and at least to come\r\nup whenever it was fine; he could not offer him a lodging, as he had\r\nno place to put him; he advised the doctor, however, not to go back to\r\nRagatz, but to stay at Doerfli, where there was a clean, tidy little\r\ninn. Then the doctor could come up every morning, which would do him\r\nno end of good, and if he liked, he, the grandfather, would act as his\r\nguide to any part of the mountains he would like to see. The doctor was\r\ndelighted with this proposal, and it was settled that it should be as\r\nthe grandfather suggested.\r\n\r\nAlm-Uncle now rose and went indoors, returning in a few minutes with a\r\ntable which he placed in front of the seat.\r\n\r\n\"There, Heidi, now run in and bring us what we want for the table,\" he\r\nsaid. \"The doctor must take us as he finds us; if the food is plain, he\r\nwill acknowledge that the dining-room is pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so indeed,\" replied the doctor as he looked down over\r\nthe sun-lit valley, \"and I accept the kind invitation; everything must\r\ntaste good up here.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and brought out\r\neverything she could find in the cupboard. The grandfather meanwhile\r\nhad been preparing the meal, and now appeared with a steaming jug of\r\nmilk and golden-brown toasted cheese. Then he cut some thin slices from\r\nthe meat he had cured himself in the pure air, and the doctor enjoyed\r\nhis dinner better than he had for a whole year past.\r\n\r\n\"Our Clara must certainly come up here,\" he said, \"it would make her\r\nquite a different person, and if she could eat for any length of time\r\nas I have today, she would grow plumper than any one has ever known her\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying a large package\r\non his back. When he reached the hut he threw it on the ground and drew\r\nin two or three good breaths of the mountain air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, here's what travelled with me from Frankfurt,\" said the doctor,\r\nrising, and he went up to the package and began undoing it, Heidi\r\nlooking on in great expectation. After he had released it from its\r\nheavy outer covering, \"There, child,\" he said, \"now you can go on\r\nunpacking your treasures yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi undid her presents one by one until they were all displayed; she\r\ncould not speak for wonder and delight. Not till the doctor opened the\r\nlarge box to show Heidi the cakes that were for the grandmother to\r\neat with her coffee, did she at last give a cry of joy, exclaiming,\r\n\"Now grandmother will have nice things to eat,\" and she wanted to pack\r\neverything up again and start at once to give them to her. But the\r\ngrandfather said he should walk down with the doctor that evening and\r\nshe could go with them and take the things. Heidi next found the packet\r\nof tobacco which she ran and gave to her grandfather; he was so pleased\r\nwith it that he immediately filled his pipe with some, and the two men\r\nthen sat down together again, the smoke curling up from their pipes as\r\nthey talked of all kinds of things, while Heidi continued to examine\r\nfirst one and then another of her presents. Suddenly she ran up to\r\nthem, and standing in front of the doctor waited till there was a pause\r\nin the conversation, and then said, \"No, the presents have not given me\r\nmore pleasure than seeing you, doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men could not help laughing, and the doctor answered that he\r\nshould never have thought it.\r\n\r\nAs the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor rose, thinking\r\nit time to return to Doerfli and seek for quarters. The grandfather\r\ncarried the cakes and the shawl and the large sausage, and the doctor\r\ntook Heidi's hand, as they all three started down the mountain. Arrived\r\nat Peter's home Heidi bid the others good-bye; she was to wait at\r\ngrandmother's till her grandfather, who was going on to Doerfli with\r\nhis guest, returned for her. As the doctor shook hands with her she\r\nasked, \"Would you like to come out with the goats tomorrow morning?\"\r\nfor she could think of no greater treat to offer him.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\" answered the doctor, \"we will go together.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi now ran in to the grandmother: she first, with some effort,\r\nmanaged to carry in the box of cakes; then she ran out again and\r\nbrought in the sausage--for her grandfather had put the presents down\r\nby the door--and then a third time for the shawl. She placed them as\r\nclose as she could to the grandmother, so that the latter might be able\r\nto feel them and understand what was there. The shawl she laid over the\r\nold woman's knees.\r\n\r\n\"They are all from Frankfurt, from Clara and grandmamma,\" she explained\r\nto the astonished grandmother and Brigitta, the latter having watched\r\nher dragging in all the heavy things unable to imagine what was\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n\"And you are very pleased with the cakes, aren't you, Grandmother?\r\ntaste how soft they are!\" said Heidi over and over again, to which the\r\ngrandmother continued to answer, \"Yes, yes, Heidi, I should think so!\r\nwhat kind people they must be!\" And then she would pass her hand over\r\nthe warm, thick shawl and add, \"This will be beautiful for the cold\r\nwinter! I never thought I should ever have such a splendid thing as\r\nthis to put on.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi could not help feeling some surprise at the grandmother seeming\r\nto take more pleasure in the shawl than the cakes. Meanwhile Brigitta\r\nstood gazing at the sausage with almost an expression of awe. She had\r\nhardly in her life seen such a monster sausage, much less owned one,\r\nand she could scarcely believe her eyes.\r\n\r\nPeter came tumbling in at this minute. \"Uncle is just behind me, he\r\nis coming--\" he began, and then stopped short, for his eye had caught\r\nsight of the sausage, and he was too much taken aback to say more. But\r\nHeidi understood that her grandfather was near and so said good-bye\r\nto grandmother. The old man now never passed the door without going\r\nin to wish the old woman good-day, and she liked to hear his footstep\r\napproaching, for he always had a cheery word for her. But today it\r\nwas growing late for Heidi, who was always up with the lark, and the\r\ngrandfather would never let her go to bed after hours; so this evening\r\nhe only called good-night through the open door and started home at\r\nonce with the child, and the two climbed under the starlit sky back to\r\ntheir peaceful dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nEXCURSIONS OVER THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the doctor climbed up from Doerfli with Peter and the\r\ngoats. At the hut, they found Heidi awaiting them with her two goats,\r\nall three as fresh and lively as the morning sun among the mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming today?\" said Peter, repeating the words with which he\r\ndaily greeted her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am, if the doctor is coming too,\" replied Heidi.\r\n\r\nPeter cast a sidelong glance at the doctor. The grandfather now came\r\nout with the dinner bag, and after bidding good-day to the doctor he\r\nwent up to Peter and slung it over his neck. It was heavier than usual,\r\nfor Alm-Uncle had added some meat today, as he thought the doctor might\r\nlike to have his lunch out of doors with the children. Peter gave a\r\ngrin, for he felt sure there was something extra good in it.\r\n\r\nAnd so the ascent began. The goats as usual came thronging round Heidi,\r\neach trying to be nearest her, until at last she stood still and\r\nsaid, \"Now you must go on in front and behave properly, and not keep\r\non turning back and pushing and poking me, for I want to talk to the\r\ndoctor.\" By degrees she managed to make her way out from among them and\r\njoined the doctor, who took her by the hand. Heidi had a great deal\r\nto say about the goats and their peculiarities, and about the flowers\r\nand the rocks and the birds, and so they clambered on and reached\r\ntheir resting-place before they were aware. Peter had sent a good many\r\nunfriendly glances towards the doctor on the way up, which might have\r\nquite alarmed the latter if he had happened to notice them, which,\r\nfortunately, he did not.\r\n\r\nHeidi led her friend to her favorite spot where she was accustomed to\r\nsit and enjoy the beauty around her; the doctor followed her example\r\nand took his seat beside her on the warm grass. The great snowfield\r\nsparkled in the bright sunlight, on the rocky peaks. A soft, light\r\nmorning breeze blew deliciously across the mountain, gently stirring\r\nthe bluebells that still remained of the summer's wealth of flowers,\r\ntheir slender heads nodding cheerfully in the sunshine. Overhead the\r\ngreat bird was flying round and round in wide circles. Heidi looked\r\nabout her first at one thing and then at another. Her eyes were alight\r\nwith joy. She turned to her friend to see if he too were enjoying the\r\nbeauty. The doctor had been sitting thoughtfully gazing around him. As\r\nhe met her glad bright eyes, \"Yes, Heidi,\" he responded, \"I see how\r\nlovely it all is, but tell me--if one brings a sad heart up here, how\r\nmay it be healed so that it can rejoice in all this beauty?\"\r\n\r\n\"But no one is sad up here, only in Frankfurt,\" exclaimed Heidi.\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled, and then growing serious again he continued, \"But\r\nsupposing one is not able to leave all the sadness behind at Frankfurt;\r\ncan you tell me anything that will help then?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you do not know what more to do you must go and tell everything\r\nto God,\" answered Heidi with decision.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is a good thought of yours, Heidi,\" said the doctor. \"But\r\nif it is God Himself who has sent the trouble, what can we say to Him\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi sat pondering for a while; she was sure in her heart that God\r\ncould help out of every trouble. She thought over her own experiences\r\nand then found her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must wait,\" she said, \"and keep on saying to yourself: God\r\ncertainly knows of some happiness for us which He is going to bring out\r\nof the trouble, only we must have patience and not run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a beautiful faith, child, and be sure you hold it fast,\"\r\nreplied the doctor. \"But can you understand, Heidi, that a man may sit\r\nhere with such a shadow over his eyes that he cannot feel and enjoy\r\nthe beauty around him, while the heart grows doubly sad knowing how\r\nbeautiful it could be. Can you understand that?\"\r\n\r\nA pain shot through the child's young, happy heart. The shadow over the\r\neyes brought to her remembrance the grandmother, who would never again\r\nbe able to see the sunlight and the beauty up here. This was Heidi's\r\ngreat sorrow, which reawoke each time she thought about the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can understand it. And I know this, that then one must say one\r\nof grandmother's hymns, which bring the light back a little, and often\r\nmake it so bright for her that she is quite happy again. Grandmother\r\nherself told me this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which hymns are they, Heidi?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I only know the one about the sun and the beautiful garden, and some\r\nof the verses of the long one, which are favorites with her, and she\r\nalways likes me to read them to her two or three times over,\" replied\r\nHeidi.\r\n\r\n\"Well, say the verses to me then, I should like to hear them too,\" said\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\nHeidi collected her thoughts for a second or two and began,--\r\n\r\n    Let not your heart be troubled\r\n    Nor fear your soul dismay,\r\n    There is a wise Defender\r\n    And He will be your stay.\r\n    Where you have failed, He conquers,\r\n    See, how the foeman flies!\r\n    And all your tribulation\r\n    Is turned to glad surprise.\r\n\r\n    If for a while it seemeth\r\n    His mercy is withdrawn,\r\n    That He no longer careth\r\n    For His wandering child forlorn,\r\n    Doubt not His great compassion,\r\n    His love can never tire,\r\n    To those who wait in patience\r\n    He gives their heart's desire.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she paused; she was not sure if the doctor was still\r\nlistening. He was sitting motionless with his hand before his eyes. His\r\nthoughts had carried him back to a long past time: he saw himself as a\r\nlittle boy standing by his dear mother's chair; she had her arm round\r\nhis neck and was saying the very verses to him that Heidi had just\r\nrecited--words which he had not heard now for years. He could hear his\r\nmother's voice and see her loving eyes resting upon him, and as Heidi\r\nceased the old dear voice seemed to be saying other things to him; and\r\nthe words he heard again must have carried him far, far away, for it\r\nwas a long time before he stirred or took his hand from his eyes. When\r\nat last he roused himself he met Heidi's eyes looking wonderingly at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Heidi,\" he said, taking the child's hand in his, \"that was a beautiful\r\nhymn of yours,\" and there was a happier ring in his voice as he spoke.\r\n\"We will come out here together another day, and you will let me hear\r\nit again.\"\r\n\r\nPeter meanwhile had been giving vent to his anger. It was now some\r\ndays since Heidi had been out with him, and when at last she did come\r\nthere she sat the whole time beside the old gentleman, and Peter could\r\nnot get a word with her. He got into a terrible temper, and at last\r\nwent and stood some way back behind the doctor, where the latter could\r\nnot see him, and doubling his fist made imaginary hits at the enemy.\r\nPresently he doubled both fists, and the longer Heidi stayed beside the\r\ngentleman, the more fiercely did he threaten with them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had risen to the height which Peter knew pointed to\r\nthe dinner hour. All of a sudden he called at the top of his voice,\r\n\"It's dinner time.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi started for the dinner bag so that the doctor might eat his where\r\nhe sat. But he stopped her, telling her he was not hungry at all, and\r\nonly cared for a glass of milk, as he wanted to climb up a little\r\nhigher. Then Heidi found that she also was not hungry and only wanted\r\nmilk, and she should like, she said, to take the doctor up to the large\r\nmoss-covered rock where Greenfinch had nearly jumped down and killed\r\nherself. So she ran and explained matters to Peter, telling him to go\r\nand get milk for the two. Peter seemed hardly to understand. \"Who is\r\ngoing to eat what is in the bag, then?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You can have it,\" she answered, \"only first make haste and get the\r\nmilk.\"\r\n\r\nPeter had seldom performed any task more promptly, for he thought of\r\nthe bag and its contents, which now belonged to him. As soon as the\r\nother two were sitting quietly drinking their milk, he opened it,\r\nand quite trembled for joy at the sight of the meat, and he was just\r\nputting his hand in to draw it out when something seemed to hold him\r\nback. His conscience smote him at the remembrance of how he had stood\r\nwith his doubled fists behind the doctor, who was giving up to him his\r\nwhole good dinner. He felt as if he could not now enjoy it. But all at\r\nonce he jumped up and ran back to the spot where he had stood before,\r\nand there held up his open hands as a sign that he had no longer any\r\nwish to use them as fists, and kept them up until he felt he had made\r\namends for his past conduct. Then he rushed back and sat down to the\r\ndouble enjoyment of a clear conscience and unusually satisfying meal.\r\n\r\nHeidi and the doctor climbed and talked for a long while, until\r\nthe latter said it was time for him to be going back, and no doubt\r\nHeidi would like to go and be with her goats. But Heidi would not\r\nhear of this, as then the doctor would have to go the whole way down\r\nthe mountain alone. She insisted on accompanying him as far as the\r\ngrandfather's hut, or even a little further. She kept hold of her\r\nfriend's hand all the time, and the whole way she entertained him with\r\naccounts of this thing and that. But at last the doctor insisted on her\r\ngoing back; so they bid each other good-night and the doctor continued\r\nhis descent, turning now and again to look back, and each time he saw\r\nHeidi standing on the same spot and waving her hand to him. Even so in\r\nthe old days had his own dear little daughter watched him when he went\r\nfrom home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, sunny autumn month. The doctor came up to the hut\r\nevery morning, and thence made excursions over the mountain. Alm-Uncle\r\naccompanied him on some of his higher ascents. The doctor found great\r\npleasure in his companion's conversation, and was astonished at his\r\nknowledge of the plants that grew on the mountain. He was well versed\r\nalso in the ways of the animals, great and small, and had many amusing\r\nanecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes and in the tops\r\nof the fir trees. And so the time passed pleasantly and quickly for\r\nthe doctor, who seldom said good-bye to the old man at the end of the\r\nday without adding, \"I never leave you, friend, without having learnt\r\nsomething new from you.\"\r\n\r\nOn some of the very finest days, however, the doctor would wander out\r\nagain with Heidi, and then the two would sit together as on the first\r\nday, and the child would repeat her hymns and tell the doctor things\r\nwhich she alone knew. Peter sat at a little distance from them, but he\r\nwas now quite reconciled in spirit and gave vent to no angry pantomime.\r\n\r\nSeptember had drawn to its close, and one morning the doctor appeared\r\nlooking less cheerful than usual. It was his last day, he said, as\r\nhe must return to Frankfurt, but he was grieved at having to say\r\ngood-bye to the mountain, which had begun to feel quite like home to\r\nhim. Alm-Uncle, on his side, greatly regretted the departure of his\r\nguest, and Heidi had been accustomed for so long to see her good friend\r\nevery day that she could hardly believe the time had suddenly come to\r\nseparate. She walked part way down the mountain with him, still unable\r\nto grasp the idea that he was going for good. After some distance the\r\ndoctor stood still, and passing his hand over the child's curly head\r\nsaid, \"Now, Heidi, you must go back, and I must say good-bye! If only I\r\ncould take you with me to Frankfurt and keep you there!\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of Frankfurt rose before the child's eyes, its endless rows\r\nof houses, its hard streets, and even the vision of Miss Rottermeyer\r\nand Tinette, and she answered hesitatingly, \"I would rather that you\r\ncame back to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are right, that would be better. But now good-bye, Heidi.\"\r\nThe child put her hand in his and looked up at him; the kind eyes\r\nlooking down on her had tears in them. Then the doctor tore himself\r\naway and quickly continued his descent.\r\n\r\nHeidi remained standing without moving. The friendly eyes with the\r\ntears in them had gone to her heart. All at once she burst into tears\r\nand started running as fast as she could after the departing figure,\r\ncalling out in broken tones: \"Doctor! doctor!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned round and waited till the child reached him. The tears were\r\nstreaming down her face and she sobbed out: \"I will come to Frankfurt\r\nwith you, now at once, and I will stay with you as long as you like,\r\nonly I must just run back and tell grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laid his hand on her and tried to calm her excitement.\r\n\"No, no, dear child,\" he said kindly, \"not now; you must stay for the\r\npresent under the fir trees, you might get sick again. But if I am ever\r\nill and alone, will you come then and stay with me? May I know that\r\nthere would then be some one to look after me and care for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I will come the very day you send for me, and I love you\r\nnearly as much as grandfather,\" replied Heidi, who had not yet got over\r\nher distress.\r\n\r\nAnd so the doctor again bid her good-bye and started on his way, while\r\nHeidi remained looking after him and waving her hand as long as a speck\r\nof him could be seen. As the doctor turned for the last time and looked\r\nback at the waving Heidi and the sunny mountain, he said to himself,\r\n\"It is good to be up there, good for body and soul, and a man might\r\nlearn how to be happy once more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA NEW HOME FOR THE WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlm-Uncle had kept his word and was not spending the winter in his old\r\nhome. As soon as the first snow began to fall, he had shut up the hut\r\nand the outside buildings and gone down to Doerfli with Heidi and the\r\ngoats. Near the church was a straggling half-ruined building, which had\r\nonce been the home of a distinguished soldier. It was rented to poor\r\npeople, who paid but a small sum, and when any part of the building\r\nfell it was allowed to remain. As soon as the grandfather had made up\r\nhis mind to spend the winter in Doerfli, he rented the old place and\r\nworked during the autumn to get it sound and tight. In the middle of\r\nOctober he and Heidi took up their residence there.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the house from the back one came first into an open\r\nspace with a wall on either side, of which one was half in ruins. Above\r\nthis rose the arch of an old window thickly overgrown with ivy, which\r\nspread over the remains of a domed roof that had evidently been part\r\nof a chapel. A large hall came next, which lay open, without doors, to\r\nthe square outside. Here also walls and roof only partially remained,\r\nand indeed what was left of the roof looked as if it might fall at\r\nany minute had it not been for two stout pillars that supported it.\r\nAlm-Uncle had here put up a wooden partition and covered the floor\r\nwith straw, for this was to be the goats' house. Endless passages led\r\nfrom this, through the rents of which the sky as well as the fields\r\nand the road outside could be seen at intervals; but at last one came\r\nto a stout oak door that led into a room that still stood intact. Here\r\nthe walls and the dark wainscoting remained as good as ever, and in\r\nthe corner was an immense stove reaching nearly to the ceiling, on\r\nthe white tiles of which were painted large pictures in blue. These\r\nrepresented old castles surrounded with trees, and huntsmen riding out\r\nwith their hounds; or else a quiet lake scene, with broad oak trees and\r\na man fishing. A seat ran all round the stove so that one could sit at\r\none's ease and study the pictures. These attracted Heidi's attention\r\nat once, and she had no sooner arrived with her grandfather than she\r\nran and seated herself and began to examine them. But when she had\r\ngradually worked herself round to the back, something else diverted\r\nher attention. In the large space between the stove and the wall four\r\nplanks had been put together as if to make a large receptacle for\r\napples; there were no apples, however, inside, but something Heidi had\r\nno difficulty in recognizing, for it was her very own bed, with its hay\r\nmattress and sheets, and sack for a coverlid, just as she had it up at\r\nthe hut. Heidi clapped her hands for joy and exclaimed, \"O Grandfather,\r\nthis is my room, how nice! But where are you going to sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your room must be near the stove or you will freeze,\" he replied, \"but\r\nyou can come and see mine too.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi got down and skipped across the large room after her grandfather,\r\nwho opened a door at the farther end leading into a smaller one which\r\nwas to be his bed-room. Then came another door. Heidi pushed it open\r\nand stood amazed, for here was an immense room like a kitchen, larger\r\nthan anything of the kind that Heidi had seen before. There was still\r\nplenty of work for the grandfather before this room could be finished,\r\nfor there were holes and cracks in the walls through which the wind\r\nwhistled, and yet he had already nailed up so many new planks that\r\nit looked as if a lot of small cupboards had been set up round the\r\nroom. He had, however, made the large, old door safe with many screws\r\nand nails, as a protection against the outside air, and this was very\r\nnecessary, for just beyond was a mass of ruined building overgrown with\r\ntall weeds, which made a dwelling-place for innumerable beetles and\r\nlizards.\r\n\r\nHeidi was very delighted with her new home, and by the morning after\r\ntheir arrival she knew every nook and corner so thoroughly that she\r\ncould take Peter over it and show him all that was to be seen; indeed\r\nshe would not let him go till he had examined every single wonderful\r\nthing contained in it.\r\n\r\nHeidi slept soundly in her corner by the stove; but every morning when\r\nshe first awoke she still thought she was on the mountain, and that she\r\nmust run outside at once to see if the fir trees were so quiet because\r\ntheir branches were weighed down with the thick snow. She had to look\r\nabout her for some minutes before she felt quite sure where she was,\r\nand a certain sensation of trouble and oppression would come over her\r\nas she grew aware that she was not at home in the hut. But then she\r\nwould hear her grandfather's voice outside, attending to the goats, and\r\nthese would give one or two loud bleats, as if calling to her to make\r\nhaste and go to them, and then Heidi was happy again, for she knew she\r\nwas still at home, and she would jump gladly out of bed and run out to\r\nthe animals as quickly as she could. On the fourth morning, as soon as\r\nshe saw her grandfather, she said, \"I must go up to see grandmother\r\ntoday; she ought not to be alone so long.\"\r\n\r\nBut the grandfather would not agree to this. \"Neither today nor\r\ntomorrow can you go,\" he said, \"the mountain is covered fathom-deep in\r\nsnow, and the snow is still falling; the sturdy Peter can hardly get\r\nalong. A little creature like you would soon be smothered by it, and we\r\nshould not be able to find you again. Wait a bit till it freezes, then\r\nyou will be able to walk over the hard snow.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi now went to school in Doerfli and eagerly set to work to learn\r\nall that was taught her. She hardly ever saw Peter there, for as a rule\r\nhe was absent. The teacher was an easy-going man who merely remarked\r\nnow and then, \"Peter is not turning up today again, it seems, but there\r\nis a lot of snow up on the mountain and I daresay he cannot get along.\"\r\nPeter, however, always seemed able to make his way through the snow in\r\nthe evening when school was over, and he then generally paid Heidi a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nAt last, after some days, when Peter climbed out of his window one\r\nmorning--the door was quite blocked by the snow outside--he was taken\r\nby surprise, for instead of sinking into the snow he fell on the hard\r\nground and went sliding some way down the mountain side like a sleigh,\r\nbefore he could stop himself. He picked himself up and tested the\r\nhardness of the ground by stamping on it and trying with all his might\r\nto dig his heels into it, but even then he could not break off a single\r\nlittle splinter of ice; the Alm was frozen hard as iron. This was just\r\nwhat Peter had been hoping for, as he knew now that Heidi would be able\r\nto come up to see them. He quickly got back into the house, swallowed\r\nthe milk which his mother had ready for him, thrust a piece of bread in\r\nhis pocket, and said, \"I must be off to school,\" and in another minute\r\nwas shooting down the mountain on his sled.\r\n\r\nHe went like lightning, and when he reached Doerfli, which stood on the\r\ndirect road to Mayenfeld, he made up his mind to go on further. So down\r\nhe still went till he reached the level ground, where the sled came to\r\na pause of its own accord, some little way beyond Mayenfeld. He knew it\r\nwas too late to get to school now, as lessons would already have begun,\r\nand it would take him a good hour to walk back to Doerfli. So he took\r\nhis time about returning, and reached Doerfli just as Heidi had got\r\nhome from school and was sitting at dinner with her grandfather. Peter\r\nwalked in, exclaiming as he stood still in the middle of the room,\r\n\"She's got it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it? what?\" asked the Uncle. \"Your words sound quite warlike,\r\ngeneral.\"\r\n\r\n\"The frost,\" explained Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! now I can go and see grandmother!\" said Heidi joyfully, for she\r\nhad understood Peter's words at once. \"But why were you not at school\r\nthen? You could have come down on the sled,\" she added reproachfully,\r\nfor it did not agree with Heidi's ideas of good behavior to stay away\r\nwhen it was possible to be there.\r\n\r\n\"It carried me on too far and I was too late,\" Peter replied.\r\n\r\n\"I call that being a deserter,\" said the Uncle, \"and deserters get\r\ntheir ears pulled, as you know.\"\r\n\r\nPeter gave a tug to his cap in alarm, for there was no one of whom he\r\nstood in so much awe as Alm-Uncle.\r\n\r\n\"And an army leader like yourself ought to be doubly ashamed of running\r\naway,\" continued Alm-Uncle. \"What would you think of your goats if one\r\nwent off this way and another that, and refused to follow and do what\r\nwas good for them? What would you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should beat them,\" said Peter promptly.\r\n\r\n\"And if a boy behaved like these unruly goats, and he got a beating for\r\nit, what would you say then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Serves him right,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Good, then understand this: next time you let your sled carry you past\r\nthe school when you ought to be inside at your lessons, come on to me\r\nafterwards and receive what you deserve.\"\r\n\r\nPeter understood the drift of the old man's questions and that he was\r\nthe boy who behaved like the unruly goats, and he looked somewhat\r\nfearfully towards the corner to see if there happened to be a stick\r\naround.\r\n\r\nBut now the grandfather suddenly said in a cheerful voice, \"Come and\r\nsit down and have something, and afterwards Heidi shall go with you.\r\nBring her back this evening and you will find supper waiting for you\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected turn of conversation set Peter grinning all over with\r\ndelight. He obeyed without hesitation and took his seat beside Heidi.\r\nBut the child could not eat in her excitement at the thought of going\r\nto see grandmother. She ran to the cupboard and brought out the warm\r\ncloak Clara had sent her; with this on and the hood drawn over her\r\nhead, she was all ready for her journey. She stood waiting beside\r\nPeter, and as soon as his last mouthful had disappeared she said, \"Come\r\nalong now.\" As the two walked together Heidi had much to tell Peter of\r\nher two goats that had been so unhappy the first day in their new stall\r\nthat they would not eat anything, but stood hanging their heads, not\r\neven rousing themselves to bleat. And when she asked her grandfather\r\nthe reason of this, he told her it was the same with the goats as with\r\nher in Frankfurt, for it was the first time in their lives they had\r\ncome down from the mountain. \"And you don't know what that is, Peter,\r\nunless you have felt it yourself,\" added Heidi.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached their destination they found Brigitta sitting alone\r\nknitting, for the grandmother was not very well and had to stay in bed\r\non account of the cold. Heidi had never before missed the old figure in\r\nher place in the corner, and she ran quickly into the next room. There\r\nlay grandmother on her little, poorly covered bed, wrapped up in her\r\nwarm grey shawl.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" she exclaimed as Heidi came running in; the poor old woman\r\nhad had a secret fear at heart all through the autumn, especially if\r\nHeidi was absent for any length of time, for Peter had told her of a\r\nstrange gentleman who had come from Frankfurt, and who had gone out\r\nwith them and always talked to Heidi, and she had felt sure he had come\r\nto take her away again. Even when she heard he had gone off alone, she\r\nstill had an idea that a messenger would be sent over from Frankfurt to\r\ntake the child. Heidi went up to the side of the bed and said, \"Are you\r\nvery ill, Grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, child,\" answered the old woman reassuringly, passing her hand\r\nlovingly over the child's head, \"it's only the frost that has got into\r\nmy bones a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall you be quite well then directly it turns warm again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, God willing, or even before that, for I want to get back to my\r\nspinning; I thought perhaps I should do a little today, but tomorrow I\r\nam sure to be all right again.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi noticed that the grandmother was wrapped up in her nice shawl and\r\nexclaimed: \"In Frankfurt everybody puts on a shawl to go out walking;\r\ndid you think it was to be worn in bed, Grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I put it on, dear child, to keep myself from freezing, and I am so\r\npleased with it, for my bedclothes are not very thick,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"But, Grandmother,\" continued Heidi, \"your bed is not right, because it\r\ngoes downhill at your head instead of uphill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, child, I can feel it,\" and the grandmother put up her hand\r\nto the thin, flat pillow, which was little more than a board under her\r\nhead, to make herself more comfortable; \"the pillow was never very\r\nthick, and I have lain on it now for so many years that it has grown\r\nquite flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if only I had asked Clara to let me take away my Frankfurt bed,\"\r\nsaid Heidi. \"I had three large pillows, one above the other, so that\r\nI could hardly sleep, and I used to slip down to try and find a flat\r\nplace, and then I had to pull myself up again, because it was proper to\r\nsleep there like that. Could you sleep like that, grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! the pillows keep one warm, and it is easier to breathe when\r\nthe head is high,\" answered the grandmother. \"But we will not talk\r\nabout that, for I have so much that other old sick people are without\r\nfor which I thank God; there is the nice bread I get every day, and\r\nthis warm wrap, and your visits, Heidi. Will you read me something\r\ntoday?\"\r\n\r\nHeidi ran into the next room to get the hymn book. Then she picked out\r\nthe favorite hymns one after another, for she knew them all by heart\r\nnow, and was as pleased as the grandmother to hear them again after so\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother lay with folded hands, while a smile of peace stole\r\nover the worn, troubled face, like one to whom good news has been\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Heidi paused. \"Grandmother, are you feeling quite well again\r\nalready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, child, I have grown better while listening to you; read it to the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nThe child read on, and when she came to the last words:\r\n\r\n    \"As the eyes grow dim, and darkness\r\n    Closes round, the soul grows clearer,\r\n    Sees the goal to which it travels,\r\n    Gladly feels its home is nearer.\"\r\n\r\nthe grandmother repeated them once or twice to herself, with a look\r\nof happy expectation on her face. And Heidi took equal pleasure in\r\nthem, for the picture of the beautiful, sunny day of her return home\r\nrose before her eyes, and she exclaimed joyfully, \"Grandmother, I know\r\nexactly what it is like to go home.\"\r\n\r\nA little later Heidi said, \"It is growing dark and I must go; I am so\r\nglad to think that you are quite well again.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran into the next room, and bid Peter come quickly, for it had now\r\ngrown quite dark. But when they got outside they found the moon shining\r\ndown on the white snow and everything as clear as in the daylight.\r\nPeter got his sled, put Heidi at the back, he himself sitting in front\r\nto guide, and down the mountain they shot like two birds darting\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi was lying that night on her high bed of hay she thought of\r\nthe grandmother on her low pillow, and of all she had said about the\r\nlight and comfort that awoke in her when she heard the hymns, and she\r\nthought: if I could read to her every day, then I should go on making\r\nher better. But she knew that it would be a week, if not two, before\r\nshe would be able to go up the mountain again. This was a thought of\r\ngreat trouble to Heidi, and she tried hard to think of some way which\r\nwould enable the grandmother to hear the words she loved every day.\r\nSuddenly an idea struck her, and she was so delighted with it that\r\nshe could hardly bear to wait for morning, so eager was she to begin\r\ncarrying out her plan. All at once she sat upright in her bed, for she\r\nhad been so busy with her thoughts that she had forgotten to say her\r\nprayers, and she never now finished her day without saying them.\r\n\r\nWhen she had prayed with all her heart for herself, her grandfather and\r\ngrandmother, she lay back again on the warm, soft hay and slept soundly\r\nand peacefully till the morning broke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nHEIDI TEACHES OBSTINATE PETER\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter arrived punctually at school the following day. He had brought\r\nhis dinner with him, for all the children who lived at a distance\r\nregularly seated themselves at mid-day on the tables, and resting their\r\nfeet firmly on the benches, spread out their meal on their knees and so\r\nate their dinner, while those living in Doerfli went home for theirs.\r\nTill one o'clock they might all do as they liked, and then school began\r\nagain. As soon as Peter finished his lessons he went over to Uncle's to\r\nsee Heidi.\r\n\r\nWhen he walked into the large room at Uncle's today, Heidi immediately\r\nrushed forward and took hold of him and said: \"I've thought of\r\nsomething, Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You must learn to read,\" she informed him.\r\n\r\n\"I have learnt,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, but I mean so that you can really make use of it,\" continued\r\nHeidi eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I never shall,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody believes that you cannot learn, nor I either now,\" said Heidi\r\nin a very decided tone of voice. \"Grandmamma in Frankfurt said long ago\r\nthat it was not true, and she told me not to believe you.\"\r\n\r\nPeter looked rather taken aback at this piece of intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"I will soon teach you to read, for I know how,\" continued Heidi. \"You\r\nmust learn at once, and then you can read one or two hymns every day to\r\ngrandmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't care about that,\" he grumbled in reply.\r\n\r\nThis hard-hearted way of refusing to agree to what was right and\r\nkind, and to what Heidi had so much at heart, aroused her anger. With\r\nflashing eyes she stood facing the boy and said threateningly, \"If you\r\nwon't learn as I want you to, I will tell you what will happen; you\r\nknow your mother has often spoken of sending you to Frankfurt, that you\r\nmay learn a lot of things, and I know where the boys there have to go\r\nto school; Clara pointed out the great house to me when we were driving\r\ntogether. And they don't only go when they are boys, but have more\r\nlessons still when they are grown men. I have seen them myself, and you\r\nmustn't think they have only one kind teacher like we have. There are\r\never so many of them, all in the school at the same time, and they are\r\nall dressed in black, as if they were going to church, and have black\r\nhats on their heads as high as that--\" and Heidi held out her hand to\r\nshow their height from the floor.\r\n\r\nPeter felt a cold shudder run down his back.\r\n\r\n\"And you will have to go in among all those gentlemen,\" continued Heidi\r\nwith increasing animation, \"and when it comes to your turn you won't be\r\nable to read and will make mistakes in your spelling. Then you'll see\r\nhow they'll make fun of you; even worse than Tinette, and you ought to\r\nhave seen what she was like when she was scornful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll learn then,\" said Peter, half sorrowfully and half angrily.\r\n\r\nHeidi was instantly mollified. \"That's right, then we'll begin at\r\nonce,\" she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nAmong other presents Clara had sent Heidi a book which the latter had\r\ndecided would be just the thing for teaching Peter, as it was an A B\r\nC book with rhyming lines. So the two sat together at the table with\r\ntheir heads bent over the book, and began the lesson.\r\n\r\nPeter was made to spell out the first sentence two or three times over,\r\nfor Heidi wished him to get it correct and fluent. At last she said,\r\n\"You don't seem able to get it right, but I will read it aloud to you\r\nonce; when you know what it ought to be you will find it easier.\" And\r\nshe read out:--\r\n\r\n    A B C must be learnt today\r\n    Or the judge will call you up to pay.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't go,\" said Peter obstinately.\r\n\r\n\"Go where?\" asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"Before the judge,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well then make haste and learn these three letters, then you won't\r\nhave to go.\"\r\n\r\nPeter went at his task again and repeated the three letters so many\r\ntimes and with such determination that she said at last,--\r\n\r\n\"You must know those three now.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing what an effect the first two lines of verse had had upon him,\r\nshe thought she would prepare the ground a little for the following\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, and I will read you some of the next sentences,\" she continued,\r\n\"then you will see what else there is to expect.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began in a clear slow voice:--\r\n\r\n    D E F G must run with ease\r\n    Or something will follow that does not please.\r\n\r\n    Should H I J K be now forgot\r\n    Disgrace is yours upon the spot.\r\n\r\n    And then L M must follow at once\r\n    Or punished you'll be for a sorry dunce.\r\n\r\n    If you knew what next awaited you\r\n    You'd haste to learn N O P Q.\r\n\r\n    Now R S T be quick about\r\n    Or worse will follow there's little doubt.\r\n\r\nHeidi paused, for Peter was so quiet that she looked to see what he was\r\ndoing. These many secret threats and hints of dreadful punishments had\r\nso affected him that he sat as if petrified and stared at Heidi with\r\nhorror-stricken eyes. Her kind heart was moved at once, and she said,\r\nwishing to reassure him, \"You need not be afraid, Peter; come here to\r\nme every evening, and if you learn as you have today you will at least\r\nknow all your letters, and the other things won't come. But you must\r\ncome regularly, not only now and then as you do to school; even if it\r\nsnows it won't hurt you.\"\r\n\r\nHe promised, and the lessons being finished for this day he now went\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nPeter obeyed Heidi's instructions punctually, and every evening\r\nwent diligently to work to learn the letters, taking the sentences\r\nthoroughly to heart. The grandfather was frequently in the room\r\nsmoking his pipe comfortably while the lesson was going on, and his\r\nface twitched occasionally as if he was overtaken with a sudden fit of\r\nmerriment. Peter was often invited to stay to supper after the great\r\nexertion he had gone through, which richly compensated him for the\r\nanguish of mind he had suffered with the sentence for the day.\r\n\r\nSo the winter went by, and Peter really made progress with his letters;\r\nbut he went through a terrible fight each day with the sentences.\r\n\r\nHe had got at last to U. Heidi read out:--\r\n\r\n    And if you put the U for V,\r\n    You'll go where you would not like to be.\r\n\r\nPeter growled, \"Yes, but I shan't go!\" But he was very diligent that\r\nday, as if under the impression that some one would seize him suddenly\r\nby the collar and drag him where he would rather not go.\r\n\r\nThe next evening Heidi read:--\r\n\r\n    If you falter at W, worst of all,\r\n    Look at the stick against the wall.\r\n\r\nPeter looked at the wall and said scornfully, \"There isn't one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but do you know what grandfather has in his box?\" asked Heidi. \"A\r\nstick as thick almost as your arm, and if he took that out, you might\r\nwell say, look at the stick on the wall.\"\r\n\r\nPeter knew that thick hazel stick, and immediately bent his head over\r\nthe W and struggled to master it.\r\n\r\nAnother day the lines ran:--\r\n\r\n    Then comes the X for you to say\r\n    Or be sure you'll get no food today.\r\n\r\nPeter looked towards the cupboard where the bread and cheese were kept,\r\nand said crossly, \"I never said that I should forget the X.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right; if you don't forget it we can go on to learn the\r\nnext, and then you will only have one more,\" replied Heidi, anxious to\r\nencourage him.\r\n\r\nPeter did not quite understand, but when Heidi went on and read:--\r\n\r\n    And should you make a stop at Y\r\n    They'll point at you and cry, Fie, fie.\r\n\r\nAll the gentlemen in Frankfurt with tall black hats on their heads, and\r\nscorn and mockery in their faces rose up before his mind's eye, and he\r\nthrew himself with energy on the Y, not letting it go till at last he\r\nknew it so thoroughly that he could see what it was like even when he\r\nshut his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe arrived on the following day in a somewhat lofty frame of mind, for\r\nthere was now only one letter to struggle over, and when Heidi began\r\nthe lesson with reading aloud:--\r\n\r\n    Make haste with Z, if you're too slow\r\n    Off to the Hottentots you'll go.\r\n\r\nPeter remarked scornfully, \"I dare say, when no one knows even where\r\nsuch people live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, Peter,\" replied Heidi, \"grandfather knows all about\r\nthem. Wait a second and I will run and ask him, for he is only over the\r\nway with the pastor.\" And she rose and ran to the door to put her words\r\ninto action, but Peter cried out in a voice of agony,--\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" for he already saw himself being carried off by Alm-Uncle and\r\nthe pastor and sent straight away to the Hottentots, since as yet he\r\ndid not know his last letter. His cry of fear brought Heidi back.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing! come back! I am going to learn my letter,\" he said,\r\nstammering with fear. Heidi, however, herself wished to know where the\r\nHottentots lived and persisted that she should ask her grandfather,\r\nbut she gave in at last to Peter's despairing entreaties. She insisted\r\non his doing something in return, and so not only had he to repeat his\r\nZ until it was so fixed in his memory that he could never forget it\r\nagain, but she began teaching him to spell, and Peter really made a\r\ngood start that evening. So it went on from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe frost had gone and the snow was soft again, and moreover fresh snow\r\ncontinually fell, so that it was quite three weeks before Heidi could\r\ngo to the grandmother again. So much the more eagerly did she pursue\r\nher teaching so that Peter might compensate for her absence by reading\r\nhymns to the old woman. One evening he walked in home after leaving\r\nHeidi, and as he entered he said, \"I can do it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what, Peter?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Read,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really mean it? Did you hear that, Grandmother?\" she called\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother had heard, and was already wondering how such a thing\r\ncould have come to pass.\r\n\r\n\"I must read one of the hymns now; Heidi told me to,\" he went on to\r\ninform them. His mother hastily brought the book, and the grandmother\r\nlay in joyful expectation, for it was so long since she had heard the\r\ngood words. Peter sat down to the table and began to read. His mother\r\nsat beside him listening with surprise and exclaiming at the close of\r\neach verse, \"Who would have thought it possible!\"\r\n\r\nThe grandmother did not speak though she followed the words he read\r\nwith strained attention.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the day following this that there was a reading lesson\r\nin Peter's class. When it came to his turn, the teacher said,--\r\n\r\n\"We must pass over Peter as usual, or will you try again once more--I\r\nwill not say to read, but to stammer through a sentence.\"\r\n\r\nPeter took the book and read off three lines without the slightest\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe teacher put down his book and stared at Peter as at some\r\nout-of-the-way and marvelous thing unseen before. At last he spoke,--\r\n\r\n\"Peter, some miracle has been performed upon you! Here have I been\r\nstriving with unheard-of patience to teach you and you have not\r\nhitherto been able to say your letters even. And now, just as I had\r\nmade up my mind not to waste any more trouble upon you, you suddenly\r\nare able to read a whole sentence properly and distinctly. How has such\r\na miracle come to pass in our days?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Heidi,\" answered Peter.\r\n\r\nThe teacher looked in astonishment towards Heidi, who was sitting\r\ninnocently on her bench with no appearance of anything supernatural\r\nabout her. He continued, \"I have noticed a change in you altogether,\r\nPeter. Whereas formerly you often missed coming to school for a week,\r\nor even weeks at a time, you have lately not stayed away a single day.\r\nWho has wrought this change for good in you?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"It was Uncle,\" answered Peter.\r\n\r\nWith increasing surprise the teacher looked from Peter to Heidi and\r\nback again at Peter.\r\n\r\n\"We will try once more,\" he said cautiously, and Peter had again to\r\nshow off his accomplishment by reading another three lines. There was\r\nno mistake about it--Peter could read.\r\n\r\nAs soon as school was over the teacher went over to the pastor to\r\ntell him this piece of news, and to inform him of the happy result of\r\nHeidi's and the grandfather's combined efforts.\r\n\r\nEvery evening Peter read one hymn aloud; so far he obeyed Heidi.\r\nNothing would induce him to read a second, and indeed the grandmother\r\nnever asked for it. His mother Brigitta could not get over her surprise\r\nat her son's attainment, and when the reader was in bed would often\r\nexpress her pleasure at it. \"Now he has learnt to read there is no\r\nknowing what may be made of him yet.\"\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions the grandmother answered, \"Yes, it is good\r\nfor him to have learnt something, but I shall indeed be thankful when\r\nspring is here again and Heidi can come; they are not like the same\r\nhymns when Peter reads them. So many words seem missing, and I try to\r\nthink what they ought to be and then I lose the sense, and so the hymns\r\ndo not come home to my heart as when Heidi reads them.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Peter arranged to make his reading as little\r\ntroublesome for himself as possible. When he came upon a word that he\r\nthought was too long or difficult in any other way, he left it out, for\r\nhe decided that a word or two less in a verse, where there were so many\r\nof them, could make no difference to his grandmother. And so it came\r\nabout that most of the principal words were missing in the hymns that\r\nPeter read aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA STRANGE LOOKING PROCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the month of May. The clear, warm sunshine lay upon the\r\nmountain, which had turned green again. The last snows had disappeared\r\nand the sun had already coaxed many of the flowers to show their bright\r\nheads above the grass. Heidi was at home again on the mountain, running\r\nbackwards and forwards in her accustomed way, not knowing which spot\r\nwas most delightful.\r\n\r\nFrom the shed at the back came the sound of sawing and chopping, and\r\nHeidi listened to it with pleasure, for it was the old familiar sound\r\nshe had known from the beginning of her life up here. Suddenly she\r\njumped up and ran round, for she must know what her grandfather was\r\ndoing. In front of the shed door already stood a finished new chair,\r\nand a second was in course of construction under the grandfather's\r\nskilful hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know what these are for,\" exclaimed Heidi in great glee. \"We\r\nshall want them when they all come from Frankfurt. This one is for\r\ngrandmamma, and the one you are now making is for Clara, and then--then\r\nthere will, I suppose, have to be another,\" continued Heidi with more\r\nhesitation in her voice, \"or do you think, Grandfather, that perhaps\r\nMiss Rottermeyer will not come with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I cannot say just yet,\" replied her grandfather, \"but it will be\r\nsafer to make one so that we can offer her a seat if she does.\"\r\n\r\nWhile talking with the grandfather there was heard from above a\r\nwhistling and calling which Heidi immediately recognized. She ran out\r\nand found herself surrounded by her four-footed friends. They were\r\napparently as pleased as she was to be among the heights again, for\r\nthey leaped about and bleated for joy. When Peter at last got up to her\r\nhe handed her a letter.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Did some one give you this while you were out with the goats,\" she\r\nasked, in her surprise.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it from then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I found it in the dinner bag.\"\r\n\r\nWhich was true to a certain extent. The letter to Heidi had been given\r\nhim the evening before by the postman at Doerfli, and Peter had put it\r\ninto his empty bag. That morning he had stuffed his bread and cheese on\r\nthe top of it, and had forgotten it when he called for Alm-Uncle's two\r\ngoats; only when he had finished his bread and cheese at mid-day and\r\nwas searching in the bag for any last crumbs did he remember the letter\r\nwhich lay at the bottom.\r\n\r\nHeidi read the address carefully; then she ran back to the shed holding\r\nout her letter to her grandfather in high glee. \"From Frankfurt! from\r\nClara! Would you like to hear it?\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather was ready and pleased to do so, as was Peter, who had\r\nfollowed Heidi into the shed.\r\n\r\n\"DEAREST HEIDI,--Everything is packed and we shall start now in two or\r\nthree days, as soon as papa himself is ready to leave; he is not coming\r\nwith us as he has first to go to Paris. The doctor comes every day,\r\nand as soon as he is inside the door, he cries, 'Off now as quickly as\r\nyou can, off to the mountain.' He is most impatient about our going.\r\nYou cannot think how much he enjoyed himself when he was with you! He\r\nhas called nearly every day this winter, and each time he describes\r\nover again all he did with you and the grandfather, and talks of the\r\nmountains and the flowers and of the great silence up there far above\r\nall towns and villages, and of the fresh, delicious air, and often\r\nadds, 'No one can help getting well up there.' He himself is quite a\r\ndifferent man since his visit, and looks happy again. Oh, how I am\r\nlooking forward to seeing everything and to being with you on the\r\nmountain, and to making the acquaintance of Peter and the goats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I shall have first to go through a six weeks' cure at Ragatz; this the\r\ndoctor has ordered, and then we shall move up to Doerfli, and every\r\nfine day I shall be carried up the mountain in my chair and spend the\r\nday with you. Grandmamma is traveling with me and will remain with\r\nme; she also is delighted at the thought of paying you a visit. But\r\njust imagine, Miss Rottermeyer refuses to come with us. Almost every\r\nday grandmamma says to her, 'Well, how about this Swiss journey, my\r\nworthy Rottermeyer? Pray say if you really would like to come with\r\nus.' But she always thanks grandmamma very politely and says she has\r\nquite made up her mind. I think I know what has done it: Sebastian gave\r\nsuch a frightful description of the mountain, of how the rocks were\r\nso overhanging and dangerous that at any minute you might fall into a\r\ncrevasse, and how it was such steep climbing that you feared at every\r\nstep to go slipping to the bottom, and that goats alone could make\r\ntheir way up without fear of being killed. She shuddered when she heard\r\nhim tell of all this, and since then she has not been so enthusiastic\r\nabout Switzerland as she was before. Fear has also taken possession\r\nof Tinette, and she also refuses to come. So grandmamma and I will be\r\nalone; Sebastian will go with us as far as Ragatz and then return here.\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly bear waiting till I see you again. Good-bye, dearest\r\nHeidi; grandmamma sends you her best love and all good wishes.--Your\r\naffectionate friend, CLARA.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the letter had been read, Peter rushed out, twirling his\r\nstick in the air in such a reckless fashion that the frightened goats\r\nfled down the mountain before him with higher and wider leaps than\r\nusual. He followed at full speed, his stick still raised in air in a\r\nmenacing manner as if he was longing to vent his fury on some invisible\r\nfoe. This foe was indeed the prospect of the arrival of the Frankfurt\r\nvisitors, the thought of whom filled him with exasperation.\r\n\r\nHeidi was so full of joyful anticipation that she determined to seize\r\nthe first possible moment next day to go down and tell grandmother who\r\nwas coming, and also particularly who was not coming. The old lady\r\nwas no longer confined to her bed. She was back in her corner at her\r\nspinning-wheel, but there was an expression on her face of mournful\r\nanxiety. Peter had come in the evening before, brimful of anger and\r\nhad told about the large party who were coming up from Frankfurt, and\r\nhe did not know what other things might happen after that; and the old\r\nwoman had not slept all night, pursued by the old thought of Heidi\r\nbeing taken from her.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran in, and taking her little stool immediately sat down by\r\ngrandmother and began eagerly pouring out all her news, growing more\r\nexcited with her pleasure as she went on. But all of a sudden she\r\nstopped short and said anxiously, \"What is the matter, Grandmother,\r\naren't you a bit pleased with what I am telling you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course, child, since it gives you so much pleasure,\" she\r\nanswered, trying to look more cheerful.\r\n\r\n\"But I can see all the same that something troubles you. Is it because\r\nyou think after all that Miss Rottermeyer may come?\" asked Heidi,\r\nbeginning to feel anxious herself.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! it is nothing, child,\" said the grandmother, wishing to\r\nreassure her. \"Just give me your hand that I may feel sure you are\r\nthere. No doubt it would be the best thing for you, although I feel I\r\ncould scarcely survive it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not want anything of the best if you could scarcely survive it,\"\r\nsaid Heidi, in such a determined tone of voice that the grandmother's\r\nfears increased as she felt sure the people from Frankfurt were coming\r\nto take Heidi back with them, since now she was well again they\r\nnaturally wished to have her with them once more. But she was anxious\r\nto hide her trouble from Heidi if possible, as the latter was so\r\nsympathetic that she might refuse perhaps to go away, and that would\r\nnot be right.\r\n\r\n\"Heidi,\" she said, \"there is something that would comfort me and calm\r\nmy thoughts; read me the hymn beginning: 'All things will work for\r\ngood.'\"\r\n\r\nHeidi found the place at once and read out in her clear, young voice:--\r\n\r\n    All things will work for good\r\n    To those who trust in Me;\r\n    I come with healing on my wings,\r\n    To save and set thee free.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, that is just what I wanted to hear,\" said the grandmother,\r\nand the deep expression of trouble passed from her face. Heidi looked\r\nat her thoughtfully for a minute or two and then said, \"healing means\r\nthat which cures everything and makes everybody well, doesn't it,\r\nGrandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is it,\" replied the old woman with a nod of assent, \"and\r\nwe may be sure everything will come to pass according to God's good\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came, Heidi returned home up the mountain. The stars\r\ncame out overhead one by one, so bright and sparkling that each seemed\r\nto send a fresh ray of joy into her heart.\r\n\r\nNot only were the nights of this month of May so clear and bright, but\r\nthe days as well; the sun rose every morning into the cloudless sky, as\r\nundimmed in its splendor as when it sank the evening before, and the\r\ngrandfather would look out early and exclaim with astonishment, \"This\r\nis indeed a wonderful year of sun; it will make all the shrubs and\r\nplants grow apace; you will have to see, General, that your army does\r\nnot get out of hand from overfeeding.\" And Peter would swing his stick\r\nwith an air of assurance and an expression on his face as much as to\r\nsay, \"I'll see to that.\"\r\n\r\nSo May passed, everything growing greener and greener, and then came\r\nthe month of June, with a hotter sun and long, light days, that brought\r\nthe flowers out all over the mountain, so that every spot was bright\r\nwith them and the air full of their sweet scents. This month too was\r\ndrawing to its close when one day Heidi, having finished her household\r\nduties, ran out with the intention of paying first a visit to the fir\r\ntrees, and then going up higher to see if the bush of rock roses was\r\nyet in bloom, for its flowers were so lovely when standing open in the\r\nsun. But just as she was turning the corner of the hut, she gave such a\r\nloud cry that her grandfather came running out of the shed to see what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, Grandfather!\" she cried, beside herself with excitement.\r\n\"Come here! look! look!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was by her side by this time and looked in the direction of\r\nher outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nA strange-looking procession was making its way up the mountain;\r\nin front were two men carrying a sedan chair, in which sat a girl\r\nwell wrapped up in shawls; then followed a horse, mounted by a\r\nstately-looking lady who was looking about her with great interest and\r\ntalking to the guide who walked beside her; then a reclining chair,\r\nwhich was being pushed up by another man, it having evidently been\r\nthought safer to send the invalid to whom it belonged up the steep path\r\nin a sedan chair. The procession wound up with a porter, with such a\r\nbundle of cloaks, shawls, and furs on his back that it rose well above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Here they come! here they come!\" shouted Heidi, jumping with joy. And\r\nsure enough it was the party from Frankfurt; the figures came nearer\r\nand nearer, and at last they had actually arrived. The men in front put\r\ndown their burden, Heidi rushed forward and the two children embraced\r\neach other with mutual delight. Grandmamma having also reached the top,\r\ndismounted, and gave Heidi an affectionate greeting, before turning to\r\nthe grandfather, who had meanwhile come up to welcome his guests. There\r\nwas no constraint about the meeting, for they both knew each other\r\nperfectly well from hearsay and felt like old acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAfter the first words of greeting had been exchanged grandmamma broke\r\nout into lively expressions of admiration. \"What a magnificent\r\nresidence you have, Uncle! I could hardly have believed it was so\r\nbeautiful! A king might well envy you! And how well my little Heidi\r\nlooks--like a wild rose!\" she continued, drawing the child towards her\r\nand stroking her fresh pink cheeks. \"I don't know which way to look\r\nfirst, it is all so lovely! What do you say to it, Clara, what do you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nClara was gazing round entranced; she had never imagined, much less\r\nseen, anything so beautiful. She gave vent to her delight in cries of\r\njoy. \"O Grandmamma,\" she said, \"I should like to remain here for ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather had meanwhile drawn up the invalid chair and spread\r\nsome of the wraps over it; he now went up to Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing we carry the little daughter now to her accustomed chair;\r\nI think she will be more comfortable, the travelling sedan is rather\r\nhard,\" he said, and without waiting for any one to help him he lifted\r\nthe child in his strong arms and laid her gently down on her own couch.\r\nHe then covered her over carefully and arranged her feet on the soft\r\ncushion, as if he had never done anything all his life but wait on\r\ncripples. The grandmamma looked on with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Uncle,\" she exclaimed, \"if I knew where you had learned to\r\nnurse I would at once send all the nurses I know to the same place that\r\nthey might handle their patients in like manner. How do you come to\r\nknow so much?\"\r\n\r\nUncle smiled. \"I know more from experience than training,\" he answered,\r\nbut as he spoke the smile died away and a look of sadness passed over\r\nhis face. The vision rose before him of a face of suffering that he had\r\nknown long years before, the face of a man lying crippled on his couch\r\nof pain, and unable to move a limb. The man had been his captain during\r\nthe fierce fighting in Sicily; he had found him lying wounded and had\r\ncarried him away, and after that the captain would suffer no one else\r\nnear him, and Uncle had stayed and nursed him till his sufferings ended\r\nin death. It all came back to Uncle now, and it seemed natural to him\r\nto attend the sick Clara and to show her all those kindly attentions\r\nwith which he had once been so familiar.\r\n\r\n\"O Heidi, if only I could walk about with you,\" said Clara longingly,\r\n\"if I could but go and look at the fir trees and at everything I know\r\nso well from your description, although I have never been here before.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi in response put out all her strength, and after a slight effort,\r\nmanaged to wheel Clara's chair quite easily round the hut to the fir\r\ntrees. There they paused. Clara had never seen such trees before, with\r\ntheir tall, straight stems, and long, thick branches growing thicker\r\nand thicker till they touched the ground. Even the grandmamma, who had\r\nfollowed the children, was astonished at the sight of them.\r\n\r\nHeidi had now wheeled Clara toward the goat shed, and had flung open\r\nthe door, so that Clara might have a full view of the inside. Clara\r\nlamented to her grandmother that they would have to leave early before\r\nthe goats came home. \"I should so like to have seen Peter and his whole\r\nflock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the flowers!\" exclaimed Clara. \"Look at the bushes of red flowers,\r\nand all the nodding blue bells! Oh, if I could but get out and pick\r\nsome!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi ran off at once and picked her a large nosegay of them.\r\n\r\n\"But these are nothing, Clara,\" she said, laying the flowers on her\r\nlap. \"If you could come up higher to where the goats are feeding, then\r\nyou would indeed see something! Bushes on bushes of the red centaury,\r\nand ever so many more of the blue-bell flowers; and then the bright\r\nyellow rock roses, that gleam like pure gold, and all crowding together\r\nin the one spot. And then there are others with the large leaves that\r\ngrandfather calls Bright Eyes, and the brown ones with little round\r\nheads that smell so delicious. Oh, it is beautiful up there, and if you\r\nsit down among them you never want to get up again, everything looks\r\nand smells so lovely!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi's eyes sparkled with the remembrance of what she was describing;\r\nshe was longing herself to see it all again, and Clara caught her\r\nenthusiasm and looked back at her with equal longing in her soft blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Grandmamma, do you think I could get up there? Is it possible for\r\nme to go?\" she asked eagerly. \"If only I could walk, climb about\r\neverywhere with you, Heidi!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I could push you up, the chair goes so easily,\" said Heidi,\r\nand in proof of her words, she sent the chair at such a pace round the\r\ncorner that it nearly went flying down the mountain-side. Grandmamma\r\nbeing at hand, however, stopped it in time.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather, meantime, had not been idle. He had by this time put\r\nthe table and extra chairs in front of the seat, so that they might all\r\nsit out here and eat the dinner that was preparing inside. The milk\r\nand the cheese were soon ready, and then the company sat down in high\r\nspirits to their mid-day meal.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma was enchanted, as the doctor had been, with their\r\ndining-room, whence one could see far along the valley, and far over\r\nthe mountains to the farthest stretch of blue sky. A light wind blew\r\nrefreshingly over them as they sat at table, and the rustling of the\r\nfir trees made a festive accompaniment to the repast.\r\n\r\n\"I never enjoyed anything as much as this. It is really superb!\" cried\r\ngrandmamma two or three times over; and then suddenly in a tone of\r\nsurprise, \"Do I really see you taking a second piece of toasted cheese,\r\nClara!\"\r\n\r\nThere, sure enough, was a second golden-colored slice of cheese on\r\nClara's plate.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it does taste so nice, Grandmamma--better than all the dishes we\r\nhave at Ragatz,\" replied Clara, as she continued eating with appetite.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, eat what you can!\" exclaimed Uncle. \"It's the mountain\r\nair, which makes up for the deficiencies of the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the meal went on. Grandmamma and Alm-Uncle got on very well\r\ntogether, and their conversation became more and more lively. They were\r\nso thoroughly agreed in their opinions of men and things and the world\r\nin general that they might have been taken for old cronies. The time\r\npassed merrily, and then grandmamma looked towards the west and said,--\r\n\r\n\"We must soon get ready to go, Clara, the sun is a good way down; the\r\nmen will be here directly with the horse and sedan.\"\r\n\r\nClara's face fell, and she said beseechingly, \"Oh, just another hour,\r\nGrandmamma, or two hours. We haven't seen inside the hut yet, or\r\nHeidi's bed, or any of the other things. If only the day was ten hours\r\nlong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is not possible,\" said grandmamma, but she herself was\r\nanxious to see inside the hut, so they all rose from the table and\r\nUncle wheeled Clara's chair to the door. But there they came to a\r\nstandstill, for the chair was much too broad to pass through the door.\r\nUncle, however, soon settled the difficulty by lifting Clara in his\r\nstrong arms and carrying her inside.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma went all round and examined the household arrangements, and\r\nwas very much amused and pleased at their orderliness and the cozy\r\nappearance of everything. \"And this is your bedroom up here, Heidi, is\r\nit not?\" she asked, as without fear she mounted the ladder to the hay\r\nloft. \"Oh, it does smell sweet, what a healthy place to sleep in.\" She\r\nwent up to the round window and looked out, and grandfather followed up\r\nwith Clara in his arms, Heidi springing up after them. Then they all\r\nstood and examined Heidi's wonderful hay-bed, and grandmamma looked\r\nthoughtfully at it and drew in from time to time fragrant draughts of\r\nthe hay-perfumed air, while Clara was charmed beyond words with the\r\nsleeping apartment.\r\n\r\n\"It is delightful for you up here, Heidi! You can look from your bed\r\nstraight into the sky, and then such a delicious smell all round you!\r\nand outside the fir trees waving and rustling! I have never seen such a\r\npleasant, cheerful bedroom before.\"\r\n\r\nUncle looked across at the grandmamma. \"I have been thinking,\" he\r\nsaid to her, \"that if you were willing to agree to it, your little\r\ngranddaughter might remain up here, and I am sure she would grow\r\nstronger. You have brought up all kinds of shawls and covers with you,\r\nand we could make up a soft bed out of them, and as to looking after\r\nthe child, you need have no fear, for I will see to that.\"\r\n\r\nClara and Heidi were as overjoyed at these words as if they were\r\ntwo birds let out of their cages, and grandmamma's face beamed with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed kind, my dear Uncle,\" she exclaimed. \"I was just\r\nthinking myself that a stay up here might be the very thing she wanted.\r\nBut then the trouble, the inconvenience to yourself! And you speak of\r\nnursing and looking after her as if it were a mere nothing! I thank you\r\nsincerely, I thank you from my whole heart, Uncle.\" And she took his\r\nhand and gave it a long and grateful shake, which he returned with a\r\npleased expression of countenance.\r\n\r\nUncle immediately set to work to get things ready. He carried Clara\r\nback to her chair outside, Heidi following, not knowing how to jump\r\nhigh enough into the air to express her contentment. Then he gathered\r\nup a whole pile of shawls and furs and said, smiling, \"It is a good\r\nthing that grandmamma came up well provided for a winter's campaign; we\r\nshall be able to make good use of these.\"\r\n\r\nThe two had meanwhile ascended to the hay-loft and begun to prepare a\r\nbed; there were so many articles piled one over the other that when\r\nfinished it looked like a regular little fortress. Grandmamma passed\r\nher hand carefully over it to make sure that there were no bits of hay\r\nsticking out. \"If there's a bit that can come through it will,\" she\r\nsaid. The soft mattress, however, was so smooth and thick that nothing\r\ncould penetrate it. Then they went down again well satisfied, and found\r\nthe children laughing and talking together and arranging all they were\r\ngoing to do from morning till evening as long as Clara stayed. The\r\nnext question was how long she was to remain, and first grandmamma was\r\nasked, but she referred them to the grandfather, who gave it as his\r\nopinion that she ought to make trial of the mountain air for at least\r\na month. The children clapped their hands for joy, for they had not\r\nexpected to be together for so long a time.\r\n\r\nThe bearers and the horse and guide were now seen approaching; the\r\nformer were sent back at once, and grandmamma prepared to mount for her\r\nreturn journey.\r\n\r\n\"It's not saying good-bye, Grandmamma,\" Clara called out, \"for you will\r\ncome up now and then and see how we are getting on, and we shall so\r\nlook forward to your visits.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmamma mounted her sturdy animal, and Uncle took the bridle to lead\r\nher down the steep mountain path; she begged him not to come far with\r\nher, but he insisted on seeing her safely as far as Doerfli, for the\r\nway was precipitous and not without danger for the rider, he said.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma did not care to stay alone in Doerfli, and therefore decided\r\nto return to Ragatz, and thence to make excursions up the mountain from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeter came down with his goats before Uncle had returned. As soon as\r\nthe animals caught sight of Heidi they all came flocking towards her,\r\nand she, as well as Clara on her couch, were soon surrounded by the\r\ngoats, pushing and poking their heads one over the other, while Heidi\r\nintroduced each in turn by its name to her friend Clara.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the latter had made the long-wished-for\r\nacquaintance of little Snowflake, the lively Greenfinch, and the\r\nwell-behaved goats belonging to grandfather, as well as of the many\r\nothers, including the Grand Turk. Peter meanwhile stood apart looking\r\non, and casting somewhat unfriendly glances towards Clara.\r\n\r\nWhen the two children called out, \"Good-evening, Peter,\" he made no\r\nanswer, but swung his stick angrily, as if wanting to cut the air in\r\ntwo, and then ran off with his goats after him.\r\n\r\nThe climax to all the beautiful things that Clara had already seen upon\r\nthe mountain came at the close of the day.\r\n\r\nAs she lay on the large, soft bed in the hay loft, with Heidi near her,\r\nshe looked out through the round, open window right into the middle of\r\nthe shining clusters of stars, and she exclaimed in delight,--\r\n\r\n\"Heidi, it's just as if we were in a high carriage and were going to\r\ndrive straight into heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and do you know why the stars are so happy and look down and nod\r\nto us like that?\" asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"No, why is it?\" Clara asked in return.\r\n\r\n\"Because they live up in heaven, and know how well God arranges\r\neverything for us, so that we need have no more fear or trouble and\r\nmay be quite sure that all things will come right in the end. But then\r\nwe must never forget to pray, and to ask God to remember us when He\r\nis arranging things, so that we too may feel safe and have no anxiety\r\nabout what is going to happen.\"\r\n\r\nThe two children now sat up and said their prayers, and then Heidi put\r\nher head down on her little round arm and fell off to sleep at once,\r\nbut Clara lay awake some time, for she could not get over the wonder\r\nof this new experience of being in bed up here among the stars. She\r\nhad indeed seldom seen a star, for she never went outside the house at\r\nnight, and the curtains at home were always drawn before the stars came\r\nout. Each time she closed her eyes she felt she must open them again to\r\nsee if the two very large stars were still looking in, and nodding to\r\nher as Heidi said they did. There they were, always in the same place.\r\nAt last her eyes closed of their own accord, and it was only in her\r\ndreams that she still saw the two large, friendly stars shining down\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nHAPPY DAYS FOR THE LITTLE VISITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning at sunrise Alm-Uncle went softly up the ladder to see if\r\nthe children were awake yet. Clara had just opened her eyes and was\r\nlooking with wonder at the bright sunlight that shone through the round\r\nwindow and danced and sparkled about her bed. She could not at first\r\nthink where she was, until she caught sight of Heidi sleeping beside\r\nher, and heard the grandfather's cheery voice asking her if she had\r\nslept well. She assured him that when she had once fallen asleep she\r\nhad not opened her eyes again all night. The grandfather was satisfied\r\nat this and immediately began to help her dress with so much gentleness\r\nand understanding that it seemed as if his chief calling had been to\r\nlook after sick children.\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi awoke she was surprised to see Clara dressed, and already\r\nin the grandfather's arms ready to be carried down. She hurried up too\r\nand soon ran down the ladder and out of the hut, and there further\r\nastonishment awaited her, for grandfather had been busy the night\r\nbefore after they were in bed. Seeing that it was impossible to get\r\nClara's chair through the hut-door, he had taken down two of the boards\r\nat the side of the shed and made an opening large enough to admit the\r\nchair; these he left loose so that they could be taken away and put up\r\nat pleasure. He was at this moment wheeling Clara out into the sun; he\r\nleft her in front of the hut while he went to look after the goats and\r\nHeidi ran up to her friend.\r\n\r\n\"O Heidi, if only I could stay up here for ever with you,\" exclaimed\r\nClara happily, turning in her chair from side to side that she might\r\ndrink in the air and sun from all quarters.\r\n\r\n\"Now you see that it is just what I told you,\" replied Heidi delighted;\r\n\"that it is the most beautiful thing in the world to be up here with\r\ngrandfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter at that moment appeared coming from the goat shed and\r\nbringing two small foaming bowls of snow-white milk--one for Clara and\r\none for Heidi.\r\n\r\n\"That will do the little daughter good,\" he said, nodding to Clara; \"it\r\nis from Little Swan and will make her strong. To your health, child!\r\ndrink it up.\"\r\n\r\nClara had never tasted goat's milk before; she hesitated and smelt\r\nit before putting it to her lips, but seeing how Heidi drank hers up\r\nwithout hesitating, and how much she seemed to like it, Clara did the\r\nsame, and drank till there was not a drop left, for she too found it\r\ndelicious, tasting just as if sugar and cinnamon had been mixed with it.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow we will drink two,\" said the grandfather, who had looked on\r\nwith satisfaction at seeing her follow Heidi's example.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter arrived with the goats, Uncle drew him aside and said, \"From\r\ntoday be sure you let Little Swan go where she likes. She knows where\r\nto find the best food for herself, and so if she wants to climb higher,\r\nyou follow her, and it will do the others no harm if they go too. A\r\nlittle more climbing won't hurt you, and in this matter she probably\r\nknows better than you what is good for her; I want her to give as fine\r\nmilk as possible. So now be off and remember what I say, and don't look\r\nso cross about it.\"\r\n\r\nPeter was accustomed to give immediate obedience to Uncle, and he\r\nmarched off with his goats, but with a turn of the head and roll of\r\nthe eye that showed he had some thought in reserve. The goats carried\r\nHeidi along with them a little way, which was what Peter wanted. \"You\r\nwill have to come with them,\" he called to her, \"for I shall be obliged\r\nto follow Little Swan.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STRANGE-LOOKING PROCESSION WAS MAKING ITS WAY\r\nUP THE MOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" Heidi called back from the midst of her friends, \"and I\r\nshall not be able to come for a long, long time--not as long as Clara\r\nis with me. Grandfather, however, has promised to go up the mountain\r\nwith both of us some day.\"\r\n\r\nAs Heidi ran back to Clara, Peter doubled his fists and made\r\nthreatening gestures towards the invalid on her couch, and then climbed\r\nup some distance without pause until he was out of sight, for he was\r\nafraid Uncle might have seen him.\r\n\r\nClara and Heidi had made so many plans for themselves that they hardly\r\nknew where to begin. Heidi suggested that they should first write to\r\ngrandmamma, to whom they had promised to send word every day, for\r\ngrandmamma had not felt sure whether it would in the long run suit\r\nClara's health to remain up the mountain. With daily news of her\r\ngranddaughter she could stay on without anxiety at Ragatz, and yet be\r\nready to go to Clara at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\n\"Must we go indoors to write?\" asked Clara. It is so much nicer out\r\nhere. So Heidi ran in and brought out her school-book and writing\r\nthings and her own little stool. She put her reading book and copy\r\nbook on Clara's knees, to make a desk for her to write upon, and she\r\nherself took her seat on the stool by the bench, and then they both\r\nbegan writing to grandmamma. But Clara paused after every sentence\r\nto look about her; it was too beautiful for much letter writing. The\r\nbreeze had sunk a little, and now only gently fanned her face and\r\nwhispered lightly through the fir trees. Now and again the call of some\r\nshepherd-boy rang out through the air, and the echo answered softly\r\nfrom the rocks. Thus the morning passed, the children hardly knew how,\r\nand soon grandfather came with the mid-day bowls of steaming milk. Then\r\nHeidi pushed Clara's chair under the fir trees, where they spent the\r\nafternoon in the shade, telling each other all that had happened since\r\nlast they met. So the hours flew by and all at once, as it seemed, the\r\nevening had come with the returning Peter, who still scowled and looked\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Peter,\" called out Heidi, as she saw he had no intention\r\nof stopping to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Peter,\" called out Clara in a friendly voice. Peter took\r\nno notice and went surlily on with his goats.\r\n\r\nAs Clara saw the grandfather leading away Little Swan to milk her, she\r\nwas suddenly taken with a longing for another bowlful of the fragrant\r\nmilk, and waited impatiently for it.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it curious, Heidi,\" she said, astonished at herself, \"as long\r\nas I can remember I have only eaten because I was obliged to, and\r\neverything used to seem to taste of cod liver oil, and I was always\r\nwishing there was no need to eat or drink; and now I am longing for\r\ngrandfather to bring me the milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know what it feels like,\" replied Heidi, who remembered the\r\nmany days in Frankfurt when all her food used to seem to stick in\r\nher throat. When grandfather at last brought the evening milk, Clara\r\ndrank it up so quickly that she had emptied her bowl before Heidi, and\r\nthen she asked for a little more. The grandfather went inside with\r\nboth the children's bowls, and when he brought them out again full he\r\nhad something else to add to their supper. He had walked over that\r\nafternoon to a herdsman's house where the sweetly-tasting butter was\r\nmade, and had brought home a large pat, some of which he had now spread\r\nthickly on two good slices of bread.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Clara lay down in her bed and prepared to watch the\r\nstars, her eyes would not keep open, and she fell asleep as soon as\r\nHeidi and slept soundly all night--a thing she never remembered having\r\ndone before. The following day and the day after passed in the same\r\npleasant fashion, and the third day there came a surprise for the\r\nchildren. Two stout porters came up the mountain, each carrying a\r\nbed on his shoulders with bedding of all kinds and two beautiful new\r\nwhite coverlids. The men also had a letter with them from grandmamma,\r\nin which she said that these were for Clara and Heidi, and that Heidi\r\nin future was always to sleep in a proper bed, and when she went down\r\nto Doerfli in the winter she was to take one with her and leave the\r\nother at the hut, so that Clara might always know there was a bed ready\r\nfor her when she paid a visit to the mountain. She went on to thank\r\nthe children for their long letters and encouraged them to continue\r\nwriting daily, so that she might be able to picture all they were doing.\r\n\r\nGrandfather went up the ladder and threw back the hay from Heidi's\r\nbed on to the great heap, and soon the beds were put up close to one\r\nanother so that the children might still be able to see out of the\r\nwindow, for he knew what pleasure they had in the light from the sun\r\nand stars.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile grandmamma down at Ragatz was rejoicing at the excellent\r\nnews of the invalid which reached her daily from the mountain. Clara\r\nfound the life more charming each day and could not say enough of the\r\nkindness and care which the grandfather lavished upon her, nor of\r\nHeidi's lively and amusing companionship.\r\n\r\nHaving such fresh assurances each day that all was going well with\r\nClara, grandmamma thought she might put off her visit to the children a\r\nlittle longer, for the steep ride up and down was somewhat of a fatigue\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather seemed to feel an especial sympathy for his little\r\ninvalid charge, for he tried to think of something fresh every day to\r\nhelp forward her recovery. He climbed up the mountain every afternoon,\r\nhigher and higher each day, and came home in the evening with large\r\nbunches of leaves which scented the air with a mingled fragrance as of\r\ncarnations and thyme. He hung them up in the goat shed for Little Swan\r\nto eat so that she might give extra fine milk.\r\n\r\nClara had now been on the mountain for three weeks. For some days past\r\nthe grandfather, each morning after carrying her down, had said, \"Won't\r\nthe little daughter try if she can stand for a minute or two?\" And\r\nClara had made the effort in order to please him, but had clung to him\r\nas soon as her feet touched the ground, exclaiming that it hurt her so.\r\nHe let her try a little longer, however, each day.\r\n\r\nIt was many years since they had had such a splendid summer among\r\nthe mountains. Day after day there were the same cloudless sky and\r\nbrilliant sun; the flowers opened wide their fragrant blossoms, and\r\neverywhere the eye was greeted with a glow of color; and when the\r\nevening came the crimson light fell on mountain peaks and on the great\r\nsnow-field, till at last the sun sank in a sea of golden flame.\r\n\r\nHeidi never tired of telling Clara of the beauty of the spot on the\r\nhigher slope of the mountain, where the bright golden rock-roses grew\r\nin masses, and the blue flowers were in such numbers that the very\r\ngrass seemed to have turned blue. An irrepressible longing came over\r\nher to see it all once more. She ran to her grandfather, who was in the\r\nshed, calling out almost before she was inside,--\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, will you take us out with the goats tomorrow? Oh, it is\r\nso lovely up there now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he answered, \"but if I do, little Clara must do something\r\nto please me: she must try her best again this evening to stand on her\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi ran back with the good news to Clara, and the latter promised to\r\ntry her very best as the grandfather wished, for she looked forward\r\nimmensely to the next day's excursion. Heidi was so pleased and excited\r\nthat she called out to Peter as soon as she caught sight of him that\r\nevening,--\r\n\r\n\"Peter, Peter, we are all coming out with you tomorrow and are going to\r\nstay up there the whole day.\"\r\n\r\nPeter, cross as a bear, grumbled some reply, and lifted his stick to\r\ngive Greenfinch a blow for no reason in particular, but Greenfinch saw\r\nthe movement, and with a leap over Snowflake's back she got out of the\r\nway, and the stick only hit the air.\r\n\r\nClara and Heidi got into their two fine beds that night full of\r\ndelightful anticipation of the morrow; they were so full of their plans\r\nthat they agreed to keep awake all night and talk over them. But their\r\nheads had no sooner touched their soft pillows than the conversation\r\nsuddenly ceased, and Clara fell into a dream of an immense field,\r\nwhich looked the color of the sky, so thickly inlaid was it with blue,\r\nbell-shaped flowers; and Heidi heard the great bird of prey calling to\r\nher from the heights above, \"Come! come! come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nWICKED PETER AND THE UNLUCKY CHAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle went out early the next morning to see what kind of a day it was\r\ngoing to be. There was a reddish gold light over the higher peaks; a\r\nlight breeze was springing up and the branches of the fir trees moved\r\ngently to and fro--the sun was on its way.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled the chair out of the shed ready for the coming journey, and\r\nthen went in to call the children and tell them what a lovely sunrise\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nPeter came up the mountain at this moment. The goats did not gather\r\nround him so trustfully as usual, but seemed to avoid him timidly, for\r\nhe had reached a high pitch of anger and bitterness, and was using\r\nhis stick very unnecessarily, and where it fell the blow was no light\r\none. For weeks now he had not had Heidi all to himself as formerly.\r\nWhen he came up in the morning the invalid child was always already\r\nin her chair and Heidi fully occupied with her. And it was the same\r\nthing over again when he came down in the evening. She had not come\r\nout with the goats once this summer, and today she was only coming in\r\ncompany with her friend and the chair, and would stick by the latter's\r\nside the whole time. It was the thought of this which was making him\r\nparticularly cross this morning. There stood the chair on its high\r\nwheels. Peter glared at it as at an enemy that had done him harm and\r\nwas likely to do him still more today. He glanced round--there was\r\nno sound anywhere, no one to see him. He sprang forward like a wild\r\ncreature, caught hold of the chair, and gave it a violent and angry\r\npush in the direction of the slope. It rolled swiftly forward and in\r\nanother minute had disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeter now sped up the mountain as if on wings, not pausing till he was\r\nwell hidden behind a large blackberry bush, for he had no wish to be\r\nseen by Uncle. But he was anxious to see what had become of the chair,\r\nso he looked, and there he saw his enemy running faster and faster down\r\nhill, then it turned head over heels several times, and finally, after\r\none great bound, rolled over and over to its complete destruction.\r\nThe pieces flew in every direction--feet, arms, and torn fragments of\r\nthe padded seat and bolster--and Peter experienced a feeling of such\r\nunbounded delight at the sight that he leapt in the air, laughing aloud\r\nand stamping for joy. He could see only good results for himself in\r\nthe disaster to his enemy. Now Heidi's friend would be obliged to\r\ngo away, for she would have no means of going about, and when Heidi\r\nwas alone again she would come out with him as in the old days, and\r\neverything would go on in the proper way. But Peter did not consider,\r\nor did not know, that when we do a wrong thing trouble is sure to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nHeidi now came running out of the hut and round the shed. Grandfather\r\nwas behind with Clara in his arms. The shed stood wide open, the two\r\nloose planks having been taken down, and it was quite light inside.\r\nHeidi looked into every corner and ran from one end to the other, and\r\nthen stood still wondering what could have happened to the chair.\r\nGrandfather now came up.\r\n\r\n\"How is this, have you wheeled the chair away, Heidi?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been looking everywhere for it, Grandfather; you said it was\r\nstanding ready outside,\" and she again searched each corner of the shed\r\nwith her eyes.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the wind, which had risen suddenly, blew open the shed\r\ndoor and sent it banging back against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been the wind, Grandfather,\" exclaimed Heidi, and her\r\neyes grew anxious at this sudden discovery. \"Oh! if it has blown the\r\nchair all the way down to Doerfli we shall not get it back in time, and\r\nshall not be able to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it has rolled as far as that it will never come back, for it is in\r\na hundred pieces by now,\" said the grandfather, going round the corner\r\nand looking down. \"But it's a curious thing to have happened!\" he added\r\nas he thought over the matter, for the chair would have had to turn a\r\ncorner before starting down hill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am sorry,\" lamented Clara, \"for we shall not be able to go\r\ntoday, or perhaps any other day. I shall have to go home, I suppose, if\r\nI have no chair. Oh, I am so sorry, I am so sorry!\"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi looked towards her grandfather with her usual expression of\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, you will be able to do something, won't you, so that it\r\nneed not be as Clara says, and so that she is not obliged to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the present we will go up the mountain as we had arranged,\r\nand then later on we will see what can be done,\" he answered, much to\r\nthe children's delight.\r\n\r\nHe went indoors, carried out a pile of shawls, and laying them on the\r\nsunniest spot he could find set Clara down upon them. Then he brought\r\nthe children's morning milk and led out his two goats.\r\n\r\n\"Why is Peter not here yet,\" thought Uncle to himself, for Peter's\r\nwhistle had not been sounded that morning. The grandfather then took\r\nClara up on one arm, and the shawls on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Now then we will start,\" he said, \"the goats can come with us.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi was pleased at this and walked on after her grandfather with an\r\narm over either of the goats' necks, and the animals were so overjoyed\r\nto have her again that they nearly squeezed her flat between them out\r\nof sheer affection. When they reached the spot where the goats usually\r\npastured they were surprised to find them already feeding there,\r\nclimbing about the rocks, and Peter with them, lying his full length on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"I'll teach you another time to go by like that, you lazy rascal! What\r\ndo you mean by it?\" Uncle called to him.\r\n\r\nPeter, recognizing the voice, jumped up like a shot. \"No one was up,\"\r\nhe answered.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen anything of the chair?\" asked the grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"Of what chair?\" called Peter back in answer in a morose tone of voice.\r\n\r\nUncle said no more. He spread the shawls on the sunny slope, and\r\nsetting Clara upon them asked if she was comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"As comfortable as in my chair,\" she said, thanking him, \"and this\r\nseems the most beautiful spot. O Heidi, it is lovely, it is lovely!\"\r\nshe cried, looking round her with delight.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather prepared to leave them. They would now be safe and\r\nhappy together he said, and when it was time for dinner Heidi was to go\r\nand bring the bag from the shady hollow where he had put it; Peter was\r\nto get them as much milk as they wanted, but Heidi was to see that it\r\nwas Little Swan's milk. He would come for them towards evening; he must\r\nnow be off to see after the chair and find out what had become of it.\r\n\r\nThe sky was dark blue, and not a single cloud was to be seen from one\r\nhorizon to the other. The great snowfield overhead sparkled as if set\r\nwith thousands and thousands of gold and silver stars. Now and again\r\na young goat came and lay down beside them; Snowflake came oftenest,\r\nputting her little head down near Heidi, and only moving because\r\nanother goat came and drove her away. And the goats had also grown\r\nfamiliar with Clara and would rub their heads against her shoulder,\r\nwhich was always a sign of acquaintanceship and goodwill.\r\n\r\nSome hours went by, and Heidi began to think that she might just go\r\nover to the spot where all the flowers grew to see if they were fully\r\nblown and looking as lovely as the year before. Clara could not go\r\nuntil grandfather came back that evening, when the flowers probably\r\nwould be already closed. The longing to go became stronger and\r\nstronger, till Heidi felt she could not resist it.\r\n\r\n\"Would you think me unkind, Clara,\" she said rather hesitatingly, \"if\r\nI left you for a few minutes? I could run there and back very quickly.\r\nI want so to see how the flowers are looking--but wait--\" for an idea\r\nhad come into Heidi's head. She ran and picked a bunch or two of green\r\nleaves, and then took hold of Snowflake and led her up to Clara.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"There, now you will not be alone,\" said Heidi, giving the goat a\r\nlittle push to show her she was to lie down near Clara, which the\r\nanimal quite understood. Heidi threw the leaves into Clara's lap,\r\nand the latter told her friend to go at once to look at the flowers\r\nas she was quite happy to be left with the goat; she liked this new\r\nexperience. Heidi ran off, and Clara began to hold out the leaves one\r\nby one to Snowflake, who snuggled up to her new friend in a confiding\r\nmanner and slowly ate the leaves from her hand. She found a strange\r\nnew pleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side, her\r\nonly companion a little goat that looked to her for protection. She\r\nsuddenly felt a great desire to be her own mistress and to be able to\r\nhelp others, instead of herself being always dependent as she was now.\r\nMany thoughts, unknown to her before, came crowding into her mind, and\r\na longing to go on living in the sunshine, and to be doing something\r\nthat would bring happiness to another, as now she was helping to make\r\nthe goat happy. An unaccustomed feeling of joy took possession of her,\r\nas if everything she had ever known or felt became all at once more\r\nbeautiful, and she seemed to see all things in a new light, and so\r\nstrong was the sense of this new beauty and happiness that she threw\r\nher arms round the little goat's neck, and exclaimed, \"O Snowflake, how\r\ndelightful it is up here! if only I could stay on for ever with you\r\nbeside me!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers, and as she caught\r\nsight of it she uttered a cry of joy. The whole ground in front of her\r\nwas a mass of shimmering gold, where the cistus flowers spread their\r\nyellow blossoms. Above them waved whole bushes of the deep blue-bell\r\nflowers. Heidi stood and gazed and drew in the delicious air. Suddenly\r\nshe turned round and reached Clara's side out of breath with running\r\nand excitement. \"Oh, you must come,\" she called out as soon as she came\r\nin sight, \"it is more beautiful than you can imagine, and perhaps this\r\nevening it may not be so lovely. I believe I could carry you, don't you\r\nthink I could?\"\r\n\r\nClara looked at her and shook her head. \"Why, Heidi, what can you be\r\nthinking of! you are smaller than I am. Oh, if only I could walk!\"\r\n\r\nHeidi looked round as if in search of something, some new idea had\r\nevidently come into her head. Peter was sitting up above looking down\r\non the two children. He had been sitting and staring before him in\r\nthe same way for hours, as if he could not make out what he saw. He\r\nhad destroyed the chair so that the friend might not be able to move\r\nanywhere and that her visit might come to an end, and then a little\r\nwhile after she had appeared right up here under his very nose with\r\nHeidi beside her. He thought his eyes must deceive him, and yet there\r\nshe was and no mistake about it.\r\n\r\nHeidi looked up to where he was sitting and called out in a commanding\r\nvoice, \"Peter, come down here!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to come,\" he called in reply.\r\n\r\n\"But you must; I cannot do it alone, and you must come here and help\r\nme; make haste and come down,\" she called again in an urgent voice.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran some way up the slope towards him, and then pausing called\r\nagain, her eyes ablaze with anger, \"If you don't come at once, Peter, I\r\nwill do something to you that you won't like; I mean what I say.\"\r\n\r\nPeter felt an inward throe at these words, and a great fear seized him.\r\nHe had done something wicked which he wanted no one to know about,\r\nand so far he had thought himself safe. But now Heidi spoke exactly\r\nas if she knew everything, and whatever she did know she would tell\r\nher grandfather, and there was no one he feared so much as this latter\r\nperson. Supposing he were to suspect what had happened about the chair!\r\nPeter's anguish of mind grew more acute. He stood up and went down to\r\nwhere Heidi was awaiting him.\r\n\r\n\"I am coming, and you won't do what you said.\"\r\n\r\nPeter appeared now so submissive with fear that Heidi felt quite sorry\r\nfor him and answered assuringly, \"No, no, of course not; come along\r\nwith me, there is nothing to be afraid of in what I want you to do.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got to Clara, Heidi gave her orders: Peter was to\r\ntake hold of her under the arms on one side and she on the other, and\r\ntogether they were to lift her up. This first movement was successfully\r\ncarried through, but then came the difficulty. As Clara could not even\r\nstand, how were they to support her and get her along? Heidi was too\r\nsmall for her arm to serve Clara to lean upon.\r\n\r\n\"You must put one arm well round my neck--so, and put the other through\r\nPeter's and lean firmly upon it, then we shall be able to carry you.\"\r\n\r\nPeter, however, had never given his arm to any one in his life. Clara\r\nput hers in his, but he kept his own hanging down straight beside him\r\nlike a stick.\r\n\r\n\"That's not the way, Peter,\" said Heidi in an authoritative voice. \"You\r\nmust put your arm out in the shape of a ring, and Clara must put hers\r\nthrough it and lean her weight upon you, and whatever you do, don't let\r\nyour arm give way; like that I am sure we shall be able to manage.\"\r\n\r\nPeter did as he was told, but still they did not get on very well.\r\nClara was not such a light weight, and the team did not match very well\r\nin size; it was up one side and down the other, so that the supports\r\nwere rather wabbly.\r\n\r\nClara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew them\r\nquickly back.\r\n\r\n\"Put your foot down firmly once,\" suggested Heidi, \"I am sure it will\r\nhurt you less after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so,\" said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed Heidi's\r\nadvice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then another; she\r\ncalled out a little as she did it; then she lifted her foot again and\r\nwent on, \"Oh, that was less painful already,\" she exclaimed joyfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE INVALID FINDS THAT SHE IS ABLE TO WALK]\r\n\r\n\"Try again,\" said Heidi encouragingly.\r\n\r\nAnd Clara went on putting one foot out after another until all at once\r\nshe called out, \"I can do it, Heidi! look! look! I can make proper\r\nsteps!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Heidi cried out with even greater delight, \"Can you really make\r\nsteps, can you really walk? really walk by yourself? Oh, if only\r\ngrandfather were here!\" and she continued gleefully to exclaim, \"You\r\ncan walk now, Clara, you can walk!\"\r\n\r\nClara still held on firmly to her supports, but with every step she\r\nfelt safer on her feet, as all three became aware, and Heidi was beside\r\nherself with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Now we shall be able to come up here together every day, and just go\r\nwhere we like; and you will be able to walk about as I do, and not have\r\nto be pushed in a chair, and will get quite strong and well. It is the\r\ngreatest happiness we could have had!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Clara heartily agreed, for she could think of no greater joy in the\r\nworld than to be strong and able to go about like other people, and no\r\nlonger to have to lie from day to day in her invalid chair.\r\n\r\nThey had not far to go to reach the field of flowers, and could already\r\ncatch sight of the cistus flowers' glowing gold in the sun. As they\r\ncame to the bushes of the blue-bell flowers, with sunny, inviting\r\npatches of warm ground between them, Clara said, \"Can't we sit down\r\nhere for a while?\"\r\n\r\nThis was just what Heidi enjoyed, and so the children sat down in\r\nthe midst of the flowers, Clara for the first time on the dry, warm\r\nmountain grass, and she found it indescribably delightful. Everything\r\nwas so lovely! so lovely! And Heidi, who was beside her, thought she\r\nhad never seen it so perfectly beautiful up here before. Then she\r\nsuddenly remembered that Clara was cured; that was the crowning\r\ndelight of all that made life so delightful in the midst of all this\r\nsurrounding beauty. Clara sat silent, overcome with the enchantment\r\nof all that her eye rested upon, and with the anticipation of all the\r\nhappiness that was now before her. There seemed hardly room in her\r\nheart for all her joyful emotions.\r\n\r\nPeter also lay among the flowers without moving or speaking, for he\r\nwas fast asleep. The breeze came blowing softly and caressingly from\r\nbehind the sheltering rocks, and passed whisperingly through the bushes\r\noverhead. Heidi got up now and then to run about, for the flowers\r\nwaving in the warm wind seemed to smell sweeter and to grow more\r\nthickly whichever way she went. So the hours went by.\r\n\r\nIt was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced solemnly\r\ntowards the plain of flowers. It was not a feeding place of theirs,\r\nfor they did not care to graze on flowers. They looked like an embassy\r\narriving, with Greenfinch as their leader. They had evidently come in\r\nsearch of their companions who had left them in the lurch, and who\r\nhad remained away so long, for the goats could tell the time without\r\nmistake. As soon as Greenfinch caught sight of the three missing\r\nfriends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud bleat, whereupon all\r\nthe others joined in a chorus of bleats, and the whole company came\r\ntrotting towards the children. Peter woke up, rubbing his eyes, for he\r\nhad been dreaming that he saw the chair again with its beautiful red\r\npadding standing whole and uninjured before the grandfather's door.\r\nHe experienced again the dreadful fear of mind that he had lost in\r\nthis dream of the uninjured chair. Even though Heidi had promised not\r\nto do anything, there still remained the lively dread that his deed\r\nmight be found out in some other way. He allowed Heidi to do what she\r\nliked with him, for he was reduced to such a state of low spirits and\r\nmeekness that he was ready to give his help to Clara without murmur or\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nWhen all three had got back to their old quarters Heidi ran and brought\r\nforward the bag, and proceeded to fulfill her promise, for her threat\r\nof the morning had been concerned with Peter's dinner. She had seen her\r\ngrandfather putting in all sorts of good things, and had been pleased\r\nto think of Peter having a large share of them, and she had meant\r\nhim to understand when he refused at first to help her that he would\r\nget nothing for his dinner, but Peter's conscience had put another\r\ninterpretation upon her words. Heidi took the food out of the bag and\r\ndivided it into three portions, and each was of such a goodly size that\r\nshe thought to herself, \"There will be plenty of ours left for him to\r\nhave more still.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave the other two their dinners and sat down with her own beside\r\nClara, and they all three ate with a good appetite after their great\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nPeter ate up every bit of food to the last crumb, but there was\r\nsomething wanting to his usual enjoyment of a good dinner, for every\r\nmouthful he swallowed seemed to choke him, and he felt something\r\ngnawing inside him.\r\n\r\nThey were so late at their dinner that they had not long to wait\r\nafter they had finished before grandfather came up to get them. Heidi\r\nrushed forward to meet him as soon as he appeared, as she wanted to\r\nbe the first to tell him the good news. She was so excited that she\r\ncould hardly get her words out when she did get up to him, but he soon\r\nunderstood, and a look of extreme pleasure came into his face. He\r\nhastened up to where Clara was sitting and said with a cheerful smile,\r\n\"So, we've made the effort, have we, and won the day!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE MUST NOT OVERDO IT,\" HE SAID, TAKING CLARA IN HIS\r\nARMS]\r\n\r\nThen he lifted her up, and putting his left arm behind her and giving\r\nher his right to lean upon, made her walk a little way, which she did\r\nwith less trembling and hesitation than before, now that she had such a\r\nstrong arm round her.\r\n\r\nHeidi skipped along beside her in glee, and the grandfather looked too\r\nas if some happiness had befallen him. \"We must not overdo it,\" he\r\nsaid taking Clara up in his arms. \"It is high time we went home,\" and\r\nhe started off down the mountain path, for he was anxious to get her\r\nindoors that she might rest after her unusual fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter got to Doerfli that evening he found a large group of people\r\ncollected round a certain spot, pushing one another and looking over\r\neach other's shoulders in their eagerness to catch sight of something\r\nlying on the ground. Peter thought he should like to see too, and poked\r\nand elbowed till he made his way through.\r\n\r\nThere it lay, the thing he had wanted to see. Scattered about the grass\r\nwere the remains of Clara's chair; part of the back and the middle\r\nbit, and enough of the red padding and the bright nails to show how\r\nmagnificent the chair had been when it was entire.\r\n\r\n\"I was here when the men passed carrying it up,\" said the baker, who\r\nwas standing near Peter. \"I'll bet any one that it was worth 125\r\ndollars at least. I cannot think how such an accident could have\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle said the wind might perhaps have done it,\" remarked one of the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good job that no one but the wind did it,\" said the baker\r\nagain, \"or he might smart for it! No doubt the gentleman in Frankfurt\r\nwhen he hears what has happened will make inquiries about it. I am glad\r\nfor myself that I have not been seen up the mountain for a good two\r\nyears, as suspicion is likely to fall on any one who was up there at\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nMany more opinions were passed on the matter, but Peter had heard\r\nenough. He crept quietly away out of the crowd and then took to his\r\nheels and ran up home as fast as he could, as if he thought some\r\none was after him. The baker's words had filled him with fear and\r\ntrembling. He was sure now that any day a constable might come over\r\nfrom Frankfurt and inquire about the destruction of the chair, and then\r\neverything would come out, and he would be seized and carried off to\r\nFrankfurt and there put in prison.\r\n\r\nHe reached home in this disturbed state of mind. He would not open his\r\nmouth in reply to anything that was said to him; he would not eat his\r\npotatoes; all he did was to creep off to bed as quickly as possible and\r\nhide under the bedclothes and groan.\r\n\r\n\"Peter has been eating sorrel again, and is evidently in pain by the\r\nway he is groaning,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"You must give him a little more bread to take with him; give him a bit\r\nof mine tomorrow,\" said the grandmother sympathizingly.\r\n\r\nAs the children lay that night in bed looking out at the stars Heidi\r\nsaid, \"I have been thinking all day what a happy thing it is that God\r\ndoes not give us what we ask for, even when we pray and pray and pray,\r\nif He knows there is something better for us; have you felt like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask me that tonight all of a sudden?\" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Because I prayed so hard when I was in Frankfurt that I might go home\r\nat once, and because I was not allowed to I thought God had forgotten\r\nme. And now you see, if I had come away at first when I wanted to, you\r\nwould never have come here, and would never have got well.\"\r\n\r\nClara had in her turn become thoughtful. \"But, Heidi,\" she began again,\r\n\"in that case we ought never to pray for anything, as God always\r\nintends something better for us than we know or wish for.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not think it is like that, Clara,\" replied Heidi eagerly.\r\n\"We must go on praying for everything, so that God may know we do not\r\nforget that it all comes from Him. If we forget God, then He lets us go\r\nour own way and we get into trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you learn all that?\" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Grandmamma explained it to me first of all, and then when it all\r\nhappened just as she said, I knew it myself, and I think, Clara,\" she\r\nwent on, as she sat up in bed, \"we ought certainly to thank God tonight\r\nthat you can walk now, and that He has made us so happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Heidi, I am sure you are right, and I am glad you reminded me; I\r\nalmost forgot my prayers for very joy.\"\r\n\r\nBoth children said their prayers, and each thanked God in her own way\r\nfor the blessing He had bestowed on Clara, who had for so long lain\r\nweak and ill.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the grandfather suggested that they should now write\r\nto the grandmamma and ask her if she would not come and pay them a\r\nvisit, as they had something new to show her. But the children had\r\nanother plan in their heads, for they wanted to prepare a great\r\nsurprise for grandmamma. Clara was first to have more practice in\r\nwalking so that she might be able to go a little way by herself; above\r\nall things grandmamma was not to have a hint of it. They asked the\r\ngrandfather how long he thought this would take, and when he told them\r\nabout a week or less, they immediately sat down and wrote a pressing\r\ninvitation to grandmamma, asking her to come soon, but no word was said\r\nabout there being anything new to see.\r\n\r\nThe following days were some of the most joyous that Clara had spent\r\non the mountain. She awoke each morning with a happy voice within her\r\ncrying, \"I am well now! I am well now! I shan't have to go about in a\r\nchair, I can walk by myself like other people.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the walking, and every day she found it easier and was able\r\nto go a longer distance. The movement gave her such an appetite that\r\nthe grandfather cut his bread and butter a little thicker each day,\r\nand was well pleased to see it disappear. He brought out the foaming\r\nmilk in a larger jug so he could fill the little bowls over and over\r\nagain. And so another week went by and the day came which was to bring\r\ngrandmamma up the mountain for her second visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE TO THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandmamma wrote the day before her arrival to let the children\r\nknow that they might expect her without fail. Peter brought up the\r\nletter early the following morning. As he neared the group his steps\r\nslackened, and the instant he had handed the letter to Uncle he turned\r\nquickly away as if frightened and ran off up the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather,\" said Heidi, who had been watching him with astonished\r\neyes, \"why does Peter always behave now like the Great Turk when he\r\nthinks somebody is after him with a stick; he turns and shakes his head\r\nand goes off with a bound just like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Peter fancies he sees the stick which he so well deserves\r\ncoming after him,\" answered grandfather.\r\n\r\nHeidi set about tidying the hut, as grandmamma must find everything\r\nclean and in good order when she arrived.\r\n\r\nClara looked on amused and interested to watch the busy Heidi at her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThen the children dressed up and went and sat together outside on the\r\nseat ready to receive her.\r\n\r\nAt last they saw the procession winding up the mountain just in the\r\norder they had expected. First there was the guide, then the white\r\nhorse with grandmamma mounted upon it, and last of all the porter with\r\na heavy bundle on his back, for grandmamma would not think of going up\r\nthe mountain without a full supply of wraps and rugs.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer wound the procession; at last it reached the top\r\nand grandmamma was there looking down on the children from her horse.\r\nShe no sooner saw them, however, sitting side by side, than she began\r\nquickly dismounting, as she cried out in a shocked tone of voice, \"Why\r\nis this? why are you not lying in your chair, Clara? What are you all\r\nthinking about?\" But even before she had got close to them she threw\r\nup her hands in astonishment, exclaiming further, \"Is it really you,\r\ndear child? Why, your cheeks have grown quite round and rosy! I should\r\nhardly have known you again!\" And she was hastening forward to embrace\r\nher, when Heidi slipped down from the seat, and with Clara leaning on\r\nher shoulder, began walking along quite coolly and naturally. Then\r\nindeed grandmamma was surprised, or rather alarmed, for she thought at\r\nfirst that it must be some unheard-of proceeding of Heidi's.\r\n\r\nBut no--Clara was actually walking steadily and uprightly beside Heidi.\r\nLaughing and crying she ran to them and embraced first Clara and then\r\nHeidi, and then Clara again, unable to speak for joy. All at once she\r\ncaught sight of Uncle standing by the seat and looking on smiling at\r\nthe meeting. She went up to the old man and seized his hands.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Uncle! my dear Uncle! how much we have to thank you for! It is\r\nall your doing! it is your care and nursing--\"\r\n\r\n\"And God's good sun and mountain air,\" he interrupted her smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and don't forget the beautiful milk I have,\" put in Clara.\r\n\"Grandmamma, you can't think what a quantity of goat's milk I drink,\r\nand how nice it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see that by your cheeks, child,\" answered grandmamma. \"I really\r\nshould not have known you; you have grown quite strong and plump, and\r\ntaller too; I never hoped or expected to see you look like that. I\r\ncannot take my eyes off you, for I can hardly yet believe it. But now\r\nI must telegraph without delay to my son in Paris, and tell him he\r\nmust come here at once. I shall not say why; it will be the greatest\r\nhappiness he has ever known. My dear Uncle, how can I send a telegram;\r\nhave you dismissed the men yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have gone,\" he answered, \"but if you are in a hurry I will get\r\nPeter, and he can take it for you.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmamma thanked him, for she was anxious that the good news should\r\nnot be kept from her son a day longer than was possible.\r\n\r\nSo Uncle went aside a little way and blew such a resounding whistle\r\nthrough his fingers that he awoke a responsive echo among the rocks\r\nfar overhead. He did not have to wait many minutes before Peter came\r\nrunning down in answer, for he knew the sound of Uncle's whistle.\r\nPeter looked as white as a ghost, for he thought Uncle was sending for\r\nhim to give him up. But instead he only gave him a written paper with\r\ninstructions to take it down at once to the post-office at Doerfli;\r\nUncle would settle for the payment later, as it was not safe to give\r\nPeter too much to look after.\r\n\r\nPeter went off with the paper in his hand, feeling some relief of mind\r\nfor the present, for as Uncle had not whistled for him in order to give\r\nhim up it was evident that no policeman had yet arrived.\r\n\r\nSo now they all sat down in peace to their dinner round the table in\r\nfront of the hut, and grandmamma was given a detailed account of all\r\nthat had taken place. How grandfather had made Clara try first to stand\r\nand then to move her feet a little every day, and how they had settled\r\nfor the day's excursion up the mountain and the chair had been blown\r\naway. How Clara's desire to see the flowers had induced her to take the\r\nfirst walk, and so by degrees one thing had led to another. The recital\r\ntook some time, for grandmamma continually interrupted it with fresh\r\nexclamations of surprise and thankfulness: \"It hardly seems possible!\r\nI can scarcely believe it is not all a dream! Are we really awake, and\r\nare we all sitting here by the mountain hut, and is that round-faced,\r\nhealthy-looking child my poor little, white, sickly Clara?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Clara and Heidi could not get over their delight at the success of\r\nthe surprise they had so carefully arranged for grandmamma and at the\r\nlatter's continued astonishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Sesemann, who had finished his business in Paris, had\r\nalso been preparing a surprise. Without saying a word to his mother he\r\ngot into the train one sunny morning and travelled that day to Basle;\r\nthe next morning he continued his journey, for a great longing had\r\nseized him to see his little daughter from whom he had been separated\r\nthe whole summer. He arrived at Ragatz a few hours after his mother\r\nhad left. When he heard that she had that very day started for the\r\nmountain, he immediately hired a carriage and drove as far as Doerfli,\r\nand then started to climb the mountain. He went on and on, but still no\r\nhut came in sight, and yet he knew there was one where Peter lived half\r\nway up, for the path had been described to him over and over again.\r\n\r\nHe began to wonder if he was on the right path, and whether the hut\r\nlay perhaps on the other side of the mountain. He looked round to see\r\nif any one was in sight of whom he could ask the way; but far and\r\nwide there was not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard. Only at\r\nmoments the mountain wind whistled through the air, and the insects\r\nhummed in the sunshine, or a happy bird sang out from the branches of\r\na solitary larch tree. Mr. Sesemann stood still for a while to let the\r\ncool Alpine wind blow on his hot face. But now some one came running\r\ndown the mountainside--it was Peter with the telegram in his hand. He\r\nran straight down the steep slope, not following the path on which Mr.\r\nSesemann was standing. As soon as the latter caught sight of him he\r\nbeckoned to him to come. Peter advanced towards him slowly and timidly,\r\nwith a sort of sidelong movement, as if he could only move one leg\r\nproperly and had to drag the other after him.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, lad,\" he called, and when Peter was near enough, \"Tell me,\"\r\nhe said, \"is this the way to the hut where the old man and the child\r\nHeidi live, and where the visitors from Frankfurt are staying?\"\r\n\r\nA low sound of fear was the only answer he received, as Peter turned to\r\nrun away in such precipitous haste that he fell head over heels several\r\ntimes, and went rolling and bumping down the slope in involuntary\r\nbounds, just in the same way as the chair, only that Peter fortunately\r\ndid not fall to pieces as that had done. Only the telegram came to\r\ngrief, and that was torn into fragments and flew away.\r\n\r\n\"How extraordinarily timid these mountain dwellers are!\" thought Mr.\r\nSesemann to himself, for he quite believed that it was the sight of a\r\nstranger that had made such an impression on this unsophisticated child\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter watching Peter's violent descent towards the valley for a few\r\nminutes he continued his journey.\r\n\r\nPeter, meanwhile, with all his efforts, could not stop himself, but\r\nwent rolling on, and still tumbling head over heels at intervals in a\r\nmost remarkable manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER WENT ROLLING AND BUMPING DOWN THE SLOPE]\r\n\r\nBut this was not the most terrible part of his sufferings at the\r\nmoment, for far worse was the fear and horror that possessed him,\r\nfeeling sure, as he did now, that the policeman had really come over\r\nfor him from Frankfurt. He had no doubt at all that the stranger who\r\nhad asked him the way was the very man himself. Just as he had rolled\r\nto the edge of the last high slope above Doerfli he was caught in a\r\nbush, and at last able to keep himself from falling any farther. He\r\nlay still for a second or two to recover himself, and to think over\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\"Well done! another of you come bumping along like this!\" said a voice\r\nclose to Peter, \"and which of you tomorrow is the wind going to send\r\nrolling down like a badly-sewn sack of potatoes?\" It was the baker,\r\nwho stood there laughing. He had been strolling out to refresh himself\r\nafter his hot day's work, and had watched with amusement as he saw\r\nPeter come rolling over and over in much the same way as the chair.\r\n\r\nPeter was on his feet in a moment. He had received a fresh shock.\r\nWithout once looking behind him he began hurrying up the slope again.\r\nHe would have liked best to go home and creep into bed, so as to hide\r\nhimself, for he felt safest when there. But he had left the goats up\r\nabove, and Uncle had given him strict injunctions to make haste back so\r\nthat they might not be left too long alone. And he stood more in awe\r\nof Uncle than any one, and would not have dared to disobey him on any\r\naccount. There was no help for it, he had to go back, and Peter went\r\non groaning and limping. He could run no more, for the anguish of mind\r\nhe had been through, and the bumping and shaking he had received, were\r\nbeginning to tell upon him. And so with lagging steps and groans he\r\nslowly made his way up the mountain.\r\n\r\nShortly after meeting Peter, Mr. Sesemann passed the first hut, and so\r\nwas satisfied that he was on the right path. He continued his climb\r\nwith renewed courage, and at last, after a long and exhausting walk,\r\nhe came in sight of his goal. There, only a little distance farther\r\nup, stood the grandfather's home, with the dark tops of the fir trees\r\nwaving above its roof.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann was delighted to have come to the last steep bit of\r\nhis journey, in another minute or two he would be with his little\r\ndaughter, and he pleased himself with the thought of her surprise. But\r\nthe company above had seen his approaching figure and recognized who it\r\nwas, and they were preparing something he little expected as a surprise\r\non their part.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped on to the space in front of the hut two figures came\r\ntowards him. One a tall girl with fair hair and pink cheeks, leaning\r\non Heidi, whose dark eyes were dancing with joy. Mr. Sesemann suddenly\r\nstopped, staring at the two children, and all at once the tears started\r\nto his eyes. What memories arose in his heart! Just so had Clara's\r\nmother looked, the fair-haired girl with the delicate pink-and-white\r\ncomplexion. He did not know if he was awake or dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know me, Papa?\" called Clara to him, her face beaming with\r\nhappiness. \"Am I so altered since you saw me?\"\r\n\r\nThen the father ran to his child and clasped her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are indeed altered! How is it possible? Is it true what I\r\nsee?\" And the delighted man stepped back to look full at her again, and\r\nto make sure that the picture would not vanish before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Are you my little Clara, really my little Clara?\" he kept on saying,\r\nthen he clasped her in his arms again, and again put her away from him\r\nthat he might look and make sure it was she who stood before him.\r\n\r\nThen grandmamma came up, anxious for a sight of her son's happy face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you say now, dear son?\" she exclaimed. \"You have given\r\nus a pleasant surprise, but it is nothing in comparison to what we\r\nhave prepared for you, you must confess,\" and she gave her son an\r\naffectionate kiss as she spoke. \"But now,\" she went on, \"you must come\r\nand pay your respects to Uncle, who is our chief benefactor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, and our little Heidi, too,\" said Mr. Sesemann, shaking\r\nHeidi by the hand. \"Well? are you quite well and happy in your mountain\r\nhome? but I need not ask, no Alpine rose could look more blooming. I am\r\nglad, child, it is a pleasure to me to see you so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Heidi looked up with equal pleasure into his kind face. How good he\r\nhad always been to her! And that he should find such happiness awaiting\r\nhim up here on the mountain made her heart beat with gladness.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma introduced him to Uncle, and while the two men were shaking\r\nhands and Mr. Sesemann was expressing his heartfelt thanks and\r\nboundless astonishment to the old man, grandmamma wandered round to the\r\nback to see the old fir trees again.\r\n\r\nHere another unexpected sight met her gaze, for there, under the trees\r\nstood a great bush of the most wonderful dark blue gentians, as fresh\r\nand shining as if they were growing on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"How exquisite! what a lovely sight!\" she exclaimed. \"Heidi, dearest\r\nchild, come here! Is it you who have prepared this pleasure for me? It\r\nis perfectly wonderful!\"\r\n\r\nThe children ran up.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I did not put them there,\" said Heidi, \"but I know who did.\"\r\n\r\n\"They grow just like that on the mountain, Grandmamma, only if anything\r\nthey look more beautiful still,\" Clara put in; \"but guess who brought\r\nthose down today,\" and as she spoke she gave such a pleased smile\r\nthat the grandmother thought for a moment the child herself must have\r\ngathered them. But that was hardly possible.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a slight rustling was heard behind the fir trees. It\r\nwas Peter, who had just arrived. He had made a long round, trying to\r\nslip by unobserved. But grandmamma had seen and recognized him, and\r\nsuddenly the thought struck her that it might be Peter who had brought\r\nthe flowers and that he was now trying to get away unseen, feeling shy\r\nabout it; but she could not let him go off like that, he must have some\r\nlittle reward.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, boy; come here, do not be afraid,\" she called to him.\r\n\r\nPeter stood still, petrified with fear. After all he had gone through\r\nthat day he felt he had no longer any power of resistance left. All\r\nhe could think was, \"It's all up with me now.\" Every hair of his head\r\nstood on end, and he stepped forth from behind the fir trees, his face\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, boy,\" said grandmamma in her effort to dispel his shyness,\r\n\"tell me now straight out without hesitation, was it you who did it?\"\r\n\r\nPeter did not lift his eyes and therefore did not see at what\r\ngrandmamma was pointing. But he knew that Uncle was standing at\r\nthe corner of the hut, fixing him with his grey eyes, while beside\r\nhim stood the most terrible person that Peter could conceive--the\r\npolice-constable from Frankfurt. Quaking in every limb, and with\r\ntrembling lips he muttered a low \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what is there dreadful about that?\" said grandmamma.\r\n\r\n\"Because--because--it is all broken to pieces and no one can put it\r\ntogether again.\" Peter brought out his words with difficulty, and his\r\nknees knocked together so that he could hardly stand.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma went up to Uncle. \"Is that poor boy a little out of his\r\nmind?\" she asked sympathizingly.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" Uncle assured her, \"it is only that he was the wind\r\nthat sent the chair rolling down the slope, and he is expecting his\r\nwell-deserved punishment.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmamma found this hard to believe, for in her opinion Peter did\r\nnot look an entirely bad boy, nor could he have had any reason for\r\ndestroying such a necessary thing as the chair. But Uncle had only\r\ngiven expression to the suspicion that he had had from the moment the\r\naccident happened. The angry looks which Peter had from the beginning\r\ncast at Clara, and the other signs of his dislike to what had been\r\ntaking place on the mountain, had not escaped Uncle's eye. Putting two\r\nand two together he had come to the right conclusion as to the cause of\r\nthe disaster, and he therefore spoke without hesitation when he accused\r\nPeter. The lady broke out into lively expostulations on hearing this.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, dear Uncle, we will not punish the poor boy any further. One\r\nmust be fair to him. Here are all these strangers from Frankfurt who\r\ncome and carry away Heidi, his one sole possession, and a possession\r\nwell worth having too, and he is left to sit alone day after day for\r\nweeks, with nothing to do but brood over his wrongs. No, no, let us be\r\nfair to him; his anger got the upper hand and drove him to an act of\r\nrevenge--a foolish one, I own, but then we all behave foolishly when\r\nwe are angry.\" And saying this she went back to Peter, who still stood\r\nfrightened and trembling. She sat down on the seat under the fir trees\r\nand called him to her kindly,--\r\n\r\n\"Come here, boy, and stand in front of me, for I have something to\r\nsay to you. Leave off shaking and trembling, for I want you to listen\r\nto me. You sent the chair rolling down the mountain so that it was\r\nbroken to pieces. That was a very wrong thing to do, as you yourself\r\nknew very well at the time, and you also knew that you deserved to be\r\npunished for it. But be sure of this, Peter: that those who do wrong\r\nmake a mistake when they think no one knows anything about it. For\r\nGod sees and hears everything, and when the wicked doer tries to hide\r\nwhat he has done, then God wakes up the little watchman that He places\r\ninside us all when we are born and who sleeps on quietly till we do\r\nsomething wrong. And the little watchman has a small goad in his hand,\r\nand when he wakes up he keeps on pricking us with it, so that we have\r\nnot a moment's peace. And the watchman torments us still further, for\r\nhe keeps on calling out, 'Now you will be found out! Now they will drag\r\nyou off to punishment!' And so we pass our life in fear and trouble,\r\nand never know a moment's happiness or peace. Have you not felt\r\nsomething like that lately, Peter?\"\r\n\r\nPeter gave a contrite nod of the head, as one who knew all about it,\r\nfor grandmamma had described his own feelings exactly.\r\n\r\n\"And you calculated wrongly also in another way,\" continued grandmamma,\r\n\"for you see the harm you intended has turned out for the best for\r\nthose you wished to hurt. As Clara had no chair to go in and yet wanted\r\nso much to see the flowers, she made the effort to walk, and every day\r\nsince she has been walking better and better. Do not forget my words,\r\nand whenever you feel inclined to do anything wrong, think of the\r\nlittle watchman inside you with his goad and his disagreeable voice.\r\nWill you remember all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will,\" answered Peter, still very subdued, for he did not yet\r\nknow how the matter was going to end, as the police-constable was still\r\nstanding with the Uncle.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, and now the thing is over and done for,\" said\r\ngrandmamma. \"But I should like you to have something for a pleasant\r\nreminder of the visitors from Frankfurt. Can you tell me anything\r\nthat you have wished very much to have? What would you like best as a\r\npresent?\"\r\n\r\nPeter lifted his head at this, and stared open-eyed at grandmamma. Up\r\nto the last minute he had been expecting something dreadful to happen,\r\nand now he might have anything that he wanted. His mind seemed all of a\r\nwhirl.\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I say,\" went on grandmamma. \"You shall choose what you\r\nwould like to have as a remembrance from the Frankfurt visitors, and as\r\na token that they will not think any more of the wrong thing you did.\r\nNow do you understand me, boy?\"\r\n\r\nThe fact began at last to dawn upon Peter's mind that he had no further\r\npunishment to fear, and that the kind lady sitting in front of him\r\nhad delivered him from the police-constable. He suddenly felt as if\r\nthe weight of a mountain had fallen off him. He had also by this time\r\nawakened to the further conviction that it was better to make a full\r\nconfession at once of anything he had done wrong or had left undone,\r\nand so he said, \"And I lost the paper, too.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmamma had to consider a moment what he meant, but soon recalled\r\nhis connection with her telegram, and answered kindly,--\r\n\r\n\"You are a good boy to tell me! Never conceal anything you have done\r\nwrong, and then all will come right again. And now what would you like\r\nme to give you?\"\r\n\r\nPeter grew almost giddy with the thought that he could have anything\r\nin the world that he wished for. He had a vision of the yearly fair at\r\nMayenfeld with the glittering booths and all the lovely things that\r\nhe had stood gazing at for hours, without a hope of ever possessing\r\none of them, for Peter's purse never held more than five cents, and\r\nall these fascinating objects cost double that amount. There were the\r\npretty little red whistles that he could use to call his goats, and\r\nthe splendid knives with rounded handles, known as toad-strikers, with\r\nwhich one could do such fine whittling.\r\n\r\nPeter remained pondering; he was trying to think which of these\r\ntwo desirable objects he should best like to have, and he found it\r\ndifficult to decide. Then a bright thought occurred to him; he would\r\nthen be able to think over the matter between now and next year's fair.\r\n\r\n\"A dime,\" answered Peter, who was no longer in doubt.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma could not help laughing. \"That is not an extravagant\r\nrequest. Come here then!\" and she pulled out her purse and put four\r\nbright silver dollars in his hand and then laid some dimes on the top\r\nof them. \"We will settle our accounts at once,\" she continued, \"and I\r\nwill explain them to you. I have given you as many dimes as there are\r\nweeks in the year, and so every Sunday throughout the year you can take\r\nout a dime to spend.\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as I live?\" said Peter quite innocently.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma laughed more still at this, and the men hearing her, paused\r\nin their talk to listen to what was going on.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, boy, you shall have it all your life--I will put it down in my\r\nwill. Do you hear, my son? and you are to put it down in yours as well:\r\na dime a week to Peter as long as he lives.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann nodded his assent and joined in the laughter.\r\n\r\nPeter looked again at the present in his hand to make sure he was not\r\ndreaming, and then said, \"Thank God!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went off running and leaping with more even than his usual\r\nagility, and this time managed to keep his feet, for it was not fear,\r\nbut joy such as he had never known before in his life, that now sent\r\nhim flying up the mountain. All trouble and trembling had disappeared,\r\nand he was to have a dime every week for life.\r\n\r\nLater, after dinner, when the party were sitting together chatting,\r\nClara drew her father a little aside, and said with an eagerness that\r\nhad been unknown to the little, tired invalid,--\r\n\r\n\"O papa, if you only knew all that grandfather has done for me from day\r\nto day! I cannot reckon his kindnesses, but I shall never forget them\r\nas long as I live! And I keep on thinking what I could do for him, or\r\nwhat present I could make him that would give him half as much pleasure\r\nas he has given me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I wish most myself, Clara,\" replied her father,\r\nwhose face grew happier each time he looked at his little daughter. \"I\r\nhave been also thinking how we can best show our gratitude to our good\r\nbenefactor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann went over to Uncle and taking him by the hand said,--\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend, you will believe me when I tell you that I have known no\r\nreal happiness for years past. What good were money and property to me\r\nwhen they were unable to make my poor child well and happy? With the\r\nhelp of God you have made her whole and strong, and you have given new\r\nlife not only to her but to me. Tell me now, in what way can I show my\r\ngratitude to you? I can never repay all you have done, but whatever is\r\nin my power to do is at your service. Speak, friend, and tell me what I\r\ncan do?\"\r\n\r\nUncle had listened to him quietly, with a smile of pleasure on his face\r\nas he looked at the happy father.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sesemann,\" he replied in his dignified way, \"I too have my share\r\nin the joy of your daughter's recovery, and my trouble is well repaid\r\nby it. I thank you heartily for all you have said, but I have need of\r\nnothing; I have enough for myself and the child as long as I live. Of\r\ncourse, I am growing old, and shall not be here much longer. I have\r\nnothing to leave the child when I die. If you could promise me that\r\nHeidi will never have to earn her living among strangers, then you\r\nwould richly reward me for all I have done for your child.\"\r\n\r\n\"There could never be any question of such a thing as that, my dear\r\nfriend,\" said Mr. Sesemann quickly. \"I look upon the child as my own.\r\nAsk my mother, my daughter; you may be sure that they will never allow\r\nthe child to be left in any one else's care! But if it will make you\r\nhappier I give you here my hand upon it. I promise you: Heidi shall\r\nnever have to go and earn her living among strangers; I will make\r\nprovision against this both during my life and after. But now I have\r\nsomething else to say. Independent of her circumstances, the child\r\nis totally unfitted to live a life away from home; we found that out\r\nwhen she was with us. But she has made friends, and among them I know\r\none who is at this moment in Frankfurt; he is winding up his affairs\r\nthere, that he may be free to go where he likes and take his rest. I\r\nam speaking of my friend, the doctor, who came over here in the autumn\r\nand who, having well considered your advice, intends to settle in this\r\nneighborhood, for he has never felt so well and happy anywhere as in\r\nthe company of you and Heidi. So you see the child will henceforth have\r\ntwo protectors near her--and may they both live long to share the task!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ARE YOU REALLY MY LITTLE CLARA?\"]\r\n\r\n\"God grant indeed it may be so!\" added grandmamma, shaking Uncle's hand\r\nwarmly as she spoke, to show how sincerely she echoed her son's wish.\r\nThen putting her arm round Heidi, who was standing near, she drew the\r\nchild to her.\r\n\r\n\"And I have a question to ask you too, dear Heidi. Tell me if there is\r\nanything you particularly wish for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is,\" answered Heidi promptly, looking up delightedly at\r\ngrandmamma.\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me at once, dear, what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to have the bed I slept in at Frankfurt with the high pillows\r\nand thick coverlid, and then grandmother will not have to lie with her\r\nhead down hill and hardly able to breathe, and she will be warm enough\r\nunder the coverlid not to have to wear her shawl in bed to prevent her\r\nfreezing to death.\"\r\n\r\nIn her eagerness to obtain what she had set her heart upon Heidi hardly\r\ngave herself time to get out all she had to say, and did not pause for\r\nbreath till she reached the end of her sentence.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest child,\" answered grandmamma, moved by Heidi's speech, \"what\r\nis this you tell me of grandmother! You are right to remind me. In the\r\nmidst of our own happiness we forget too often that which we ought to\r\nremember before all things. When God has shown us some special mercy\r\nwe should think at once of those who are denied so many things. I will\r\ntelegraph to Frankfurt at once! Miss Rottermeyer shall pack up the bed\r\nthis very day, and it will be here in two days' time. God willing,\r\ngrandmother shall soon be sleeping comfortably upon it.\"\r\n\r\nHeidi skipped round grandmamma in her glee, and then stopping all of a\r\nsudden, said quickly, \"I must make haste down and tell her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Heidi, what can you be thinking of,\" said her grandfather\r\nreprovingly. \"You can't be running backwards and forwards like that\r\nwhen you have visitors.\"\r\n\r\nBut grandmamma interfered on Heidi's behalf. \"The child is not so\r\nfar wrong, Uncle,\" she said, \"and poor grandmother has too long been\r\ndeprived of Heidi for our sakes. Let us all go down to her together. I\r\nbelieve my horse is waiting for me and I can ride down from there, and\r\nas soon as I get to Doerfli the message shall be sent off. What do you\r\nthink of my plan, son?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had not yet had time to speak of his travelling plans, so\r\nhe begged his mother to wait a few moments that he might tell her what\r\nhe proposed doing.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had been arranging that he and his mother should make a\r\nlittle tour in Switzerland, first ascertaining if Clara was in a fit\r\nstate to go some part of the way with them. But now he would have the\r\nfull enjoyment of his daughter's company, and that being so he did\r\nnot want to miss any of these beautiful days of later summer, but to\r\nstart at once on the journey that he now looked forward to with such\r\nadditional pleasure. And so he proposed that they should spend the\r\nnight in Doerfli and that next day he should come and get Clara, then\r\nthey would all three go down to Ragatz and make that their starting\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nClara was rather upset at first at the thought of saying good-bye like\r\nthis to the mountain; she could not help being pleased, however, at the\r\nprospect of another journey, and no time was allowed her to give way to\r\nlamentation.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma had already taken Heidi by the hand, preparatory to leading\r\nthe way, when she suddenly turned. \"But what is to become of Clara?\"\r\nshe asked, remembering all at once that the child could not yet take so\r\nlong a walk. She gave a nod of satisfaction as she saw that Uncle had\r\nalready taken Clara up in his arms and was following her with sturdy\r\nstrides. Mr. Sesemann brought up the rear, and so they all started down\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nHeidi kept jumping for joy as she and Mrs. Sesemann walked along side\r\nby side, and grandmamma asked all about Peter's grandmother, how she\r\nlived, and what she did, especially in the winter when it was so cold.\r\nAnd Heidi gave her a minute account of everything, for she knew all\r\nthat went on at grandmother's, and told her how the old woman sat\r\ncrouching in her corner and trembling with cold. She was able also\r\nto give her exact particulars of what grandmother had and had not to\r\neat. Grandmamma listened with interest and sympathy until they came\r\nto grandmother's. Brigitta was just hanging out Peter's second shirt\r\nin the sun, so that he might have it ready to put on when he had worn\r\nthe other long enough. As soon as she saw the company approaching she\r\nrushed indoors.\r\n\r\n\"The whole party of them are just going past, mother, evidently all\r\nreturning home again,\" she informed the old woman. \"Uncle is with them,\r\ncarrying the sick child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, it is really to be so then?\" sighed the grandmother. \"And you\r\nsaw Heidi with them? Then they are taking her away. If only she could\r\ncome and put her hand in mine again! If I could but hear her voice once\r\nmore!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door flew open and Heidi sprang across to the corner\r\nand threw her arms round grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother! Grandmother! my bed is to be sent from Frankfurt with all\r\nthe three pillows and the thick coverlid; grandmamma says it will be\r\nhere in two days.\" Heidi could not get out her words quickly enough,\r\nfor she was impatient to see grandmother's great joy at the news. The\r\nlatter smiled, but said a little sadly,--\r\n\r\n\"She must indeed be a good, kind lady, and I ought to be glad to think\r\nshe is taking you with her, but I shall not outlive it long.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this I hear? Who has been telling my good grandmother such\r\ntales?\" exclaimed a kindly voice, and grandmother felt her hand taken\r\nand warmly pressed, for grandmamma had followed Heidi in and heard all\r\nthat was said. \"No, no, there is no thought of such a thing! Heidi is\r\ngoing to stay with you and make you happy. We want to see her again,\r\nbut we shall come to her. We hope to pay a visit to the Alm every year,\r\nfor we have good cause to offer up especial thanks to God upon this\r\nspot where so great a miracle has been wrought upon our child.\"\r\n\r\nThen grandmother's face was lighted up with genuine happiness, and she\r\npressed Mrs. Sesemann's hand over and over again, unable to speak her\r\nthanks, while two large tears of joy rolled down her aged cheeks. And\r\nHeidi saw the glad change come over grandmother's face, and she too now\r\nwas entirely happy.\r\n\r\nShe clung to the old woman saying, \"Hasn't it all come about,\r\ngrandmother, just like the hymn I read to you last time? Isn't the bed\r\nfrom Frankfurt sent to make you well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Heidi, and many, many other good things too, which God has sent\r\nme,\" said the grandmother, deeply moved. \"I did not think it possible\r\nthat there were so many kind people, ready to trouble themselves about\r\na poor old woman and to do so much for her. Nothing strengthens our\r\nbelief in a kind heavenly Father who never forgets even the least of\r\nHis creatures so much as to know that there are such people, full of\r\ngoodness and pity for a poor, useless creature such as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good grandmother,\" said Mrs. Sesemann, interrupting her, \"we are\r\nall equally poor and helpless in the eyes of God, and all have equal\r\nneed that He should not forget us. But now we must say good-bye, but\r\nonly till we meet again, for when we pay our next year's visit to the\r\nAlm you will be the first person we shall come and see; meanwhile we\r\nshall not forget you.\" And Mrs. Sesemann took grandmother's hand again\r\nand shook it in farewell.\r\n\r\nBut grandmother would not let her off even then without more words\r\nof gratitude, and without calling down on her benefactress and all\r\nbelonging to her every blessing that God had to bestow.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Sesemann and his mother were able to continue their journey\r\ndownwards, while Uncle carried Clara back home, with Heidi beside him,\r\nso full of joy of what was coming for grandmother that every step was a\r\njump.\r\n\r\nBut there were many tears shed the following morning by the departing\r\nClara, who wept to say good-bye to the beautiful mountain home where\r\nshe had been happier than ever before in her life. Heidi did her best\r\nto comfort her. \"Summer will be here again in no time,\" she said, \"and\r\nthen you will come again, and it will be nicer still, for you will be\r\nable to walk about from the beginning. We can then go out every day\r\nwith the goats up to where the flowers grow, and enjoy ourselves from\r\nthe moment you arrive.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had come as arranged to take his little daughter away,\r\nand was just now standing and talking with Uncle, for they had much to\r\nsay to one another. Clara felt somewhat consoled by Heidi's words, and\r\nwiped away her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Be sure you say good-bye for me to Peter and the goats, and especially\r\nto Little Swan. I wish I could give Little Swan a present, for she has\r\nhelped so much to make me strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can if you like,\" replied Heidi, \"send her a little salt;\r\nyou know how she likes to lick some out of grandfather's hand when she\r\ncomes home at night.\"\r\n\r\nClara was delighted at this idea. \"Oh, then I shall send a hundred\r\npounds of salt from Frankfurt, for I want her to have something as a\r\nremembrance of me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann now beckoned to the children as it was time to be off.\r\nGrandmamma's white horse had been brought up for Clara, as she was no\r\nlonger obliged to be carried in a chair.\r\n\r\nHeidi ran to the far edge of the slope and continued to wave her hand\r\nto Clara until the last glimpse of horse and rider had disappeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now the bed has arrived, and grandmother is sleeping so soundly all\r\nnight that she is sure to grow stronger.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma Sesemann, moreover, has not forgotten how cold the winter is\r\non the mountain. She has sent a large parcel of warm clothing of every\r\ndescription, so that the blind grandmother can wrap herself round and\r\nround, and will certainly not tremble with cold now as she sits in her\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of building going on at Doerfli. The doctor has\r\narrived, and, for the present, is occupying his old quarters. His\r\nfriends have advised him to buy the old house that Uncle and Heidi\r\nlive in during the winter. The doctor is having this part of the old\r\nhouse rebuilt for himself, the other part being repaired for Uncle\r\nand Heidi, for the doctor is aware that Uncle is a man of independent\r\nspirit, who likes to have a house to himself. Quite at the back a warm\r\nand well-walled stall is being put up for the two goats, and there they\r\nwill pass their winter in comfort.\r\n\r\nThe two men are becoming better friends every day, and as they walk\r\nabout the new buildings to see how they are getting on, their thoughts\r\ncontinually turn to Heidi, for the chief pleasure to each in connection\r\nwith the house is that they will have the light-hearted little child\r\nwith them there.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend,\" said the doctor on one of these occasions as they were\r\nstanding together, \"you will see this matter in the same light as I do,\r\nI am sure. I share your happiness in the child as if, next to you, I\r\nwas the one to whom she most closely belonged, but I wish also to share\r\nall responsibilities concerning her and to do my best for the child. I\r\nshall then feel I have my rights in her, and shall look forward to her\r\nbeing with me and caring for me in my old age, which is the one great\r\nwish of my heart. She will have the same claims upon me as if she were\r\nmy own child, and I shall provide for her as such, and so we shall be\r\nable to leave her without anxiety when the day comes that you and I\r\nmust go.\"\r\n\r\nUncle did not speak, but he clasped the doctor's hand in his, and his\r\ngood friend could read in the old man's eyes how greatly moved he was\r\nand how glad and grateful he felt.\r\n\r\nHeidi and Peter were at this moment sitting with grandmother, and the\r\none had so much to relate, and the others to listen to, that they all\r\nthree got closer and closer to one another, hardly able to breathe in\r\ntheir eagerness not to miss a word.\r\n\r\nAnd how much there was to tell of all the events that had taken place\r\nthat last summer, for they had not had many opportunities of meeting\r\nsince then.\r\n\r\nAnd it was difficult to say which of the three looked the happiest at\r\nbeing together again, and at the recollection of all the wonderful\r\nthings that had happened. Mother Brigitta's face was perhaps the\r\nhappiest of all, as now, with the help of Heidi's explanation, she was\r\nable to understand for the first time the history of Peter's weekly\r\ndime for life.\r\n\r\nThen at last the grandmother spoke, \"Heidi read me one of the hymns! I\r\nfeel I can do nothing for the remainder of my life but thank the Father\r\nin Heaven for all the mercies He has shown us!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors have been corrected.
