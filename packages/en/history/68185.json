This movement is also a reaction from the teachings of\r\nHippolyte Taine among historians and of Herbert Spencer among\r\nbiologists, because it proves that environment and in the case of man,\r\neducation, have an immediate, apparent and temporary influence, while\r\nheredity has a deep, subtle and permanent influence on the actions of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThus the racial history of Europe, which forms the author’s main outline\r\nand subject and which is wholly original in treatment, might be\r\nparaphrased as the heredity history of Europe. It is history as\r\ninfluenced by the hereditary impulses, predispositions and tendencies\r\nwhich, as highly distinctive racial traits, date back many thousands of\r\nyears and were originally formed when man was still in the tribal state,\r\nlong before the advent of civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the author’s opening chapters these traits and tendencies are\r\ncommented upon as they are observed to-day under the varying influences\r\nof migration and changes of social and physical environment. In the\r\nchapters relating to the racial history of Europe we enter a new and\r\nfascinating field of study, which I trust the author himself may some\r\nday expand into a longer story. There is no gainsaying that this is the\r\ncorrect scientific method of approaching the problem of the past.\r\n\r\nThe moral tendency of the heredity interpretation of history is for our\r\nday and generation and is in strong accord with the true spirit of the\r\nmodern eugenics movement in relation to patriotism, namely, the\r\nconservation and multiplication for our country of the best spiritual,\r\nmoral, intellectual and physical forces of heredity; thus only will the\r\nintegrity of our institutions be maintained in the future. These divine\r\nforces are more or less sporadically distributed in all races, some of\r\nthem are found in what we call the lowest races, some are scattered\r\nwidely throughout humanity, but they are certainly more widely and\r\nuniformly distributed in some races than in others.\r\n\r\nThus conservation of that race which has given us the true spirit of\r\nAmericanism is not a matter either of racial pride or of racial\r\nprejudice; it is a matter of love of country, of a true sentiment which\r\nis based upon knowledge and the lessons of history rather than upon the\r\nsentimentalism which is fostered by ignorance. If I were asked: What is\r\nthe greatest danger which threatens the American republic to-day? I\r\nwould certainly reply: The gradual dying out among our people of those\r\nhereditary traits through which the principles of our religious,\r\npolitical and social foundations were laid down and their insidious\r\nreplacement by traits of less noble character.\r\n\r\n                                                 HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN.\r\n\r\n  July 13, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory is repeating itself in America at the present time and\r\nincidentally is giving a convincing demonstration of the central thought\r\nin this volume, namely, that heredity and racial predisposition are\r\nstronger and more stable than environment and education.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be its intellectual, its literary, its artistic or its\r\nmusical aptitudes, as compared with other races, the Anglo-Saxon branch\r\nof the Nordic race is again showing itself to be that upon which the\r\nnation must chiefly depend for leadership, for courage, for loyalty, for\r\nunity and harmony of action, for self-sacrifice and devotion to an\r\nideal. Not that members of other races are not doing their part, many of\r\nthem are, but in no other human stock which has come to this country is\r\nthere displayed the unanimity of heart, mind and action which is now\r\nbeing displayed by the descendants of the blue eyed, fair-haired peoples\r\nof the north of Europe. In a recent journey in northern California and\r\nOregon I noted that, in the faces of the regiments which were first to\r\nleave for the city of New York and later that, in the wonderful array of\r\nyoung men at Plattsburg, the Anglo-Saxon type was clearly dominant over\r\nevery other and the purest members of this type largely outnumbered the\r\nothers. In northern California I saw a great regiment detrain and with\r\none or two exceptions they were all native Americans, descendants of the\r\nEnglish, Scotch and north of Ireland men who founded the State of Oregon\r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century. At Plattsburg fair hair and\r\nblue eyes were very noticeable, much more so than in any ordinary crowds\r\nof American collegians as seen assembled in our universities.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered also that many of the dark-haired, dark-eyed\r\nyouths of Plattsburg and other volunteer training camps are often\r\nthree-fourths or seven-eighths Nordic, because it only requires a single\r\ndark-eyed ancestor to lend the dark hair and eye color to an otherwise\r\npure Nordic strain. There is a clear differentiation between the\r\noriginal Nordic, the Alpine and the Mediterranean strains; but where\r\nphysical characters and characteristics are partly combined in a mosaic,\r\nand to a less degree are blended, it requires long experience to judge\r\nwhich strain dominates.\r\n\r\nWith a race having these predispositions, extending back to the very\r\nbeginnings of European history, there is no hesitation or even waiting\r\nfor conscription and the sad thought was continually in my mind in\r\nCalifornia, in Oregon and in Plattsburg that again this race was\r\npassing, that this war will take a very heavy toll of this strain of\r\nAnglo-Saxon life which has played so large a part in American history.\r\n\r\nWar is in the highest sense dysgenic rather than eugenic. It is\r\ndestructive of the best strains, spiritually, morally and physically.\r\nFor the world’s future the destruction of wealth is a small matter\r\ncompared with the destruction of the best human strains, for wealth can\r\nbe renewed while these strains of the real human aristocracy once lost\r\nare lost forever. In the new world that we are working and fighting for,\r\nthe world of liberty, of justice and of humanity, we shall save\r\ndemocracy only when democracy discovers its own aristocracy as in the\r\ndays when our Republic was founded.\r\n\r\n                                                 HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN.\r\n\r\n  December, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _PART I_\r\n                     RACE, LANGUAGE AND NATIONALITY\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n               I.

Practically all historians, while\r\nusing the word race, have relied on tribal or national names as its sole\r\ndefinition. The ancients, like the moderns, in determining ethnical\r\norigin did not look beyond a man’s name, language or country and the\r\nactual information furnished by classic literature on the subject of\r\nphysical characters is limited to a few scattered and often obscure\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nModern anthropology has demonstrated that racial lines are not only\r\nabsolutely independent of both national and linguistic groupings, but\r\nthat in many cases these racial lines cut through them at sharp angles\r\nand correspond closely with the divisions of social cleavage. The great\r\nlesson of the science of race is the immutability of somatological or\r\nbodily characters, with which is closely associated the immutability of\r\npsychical predispositions and impulses. This continuity of inheritance\r\nhas a most important bearing on the theory of democracy and still more\r\nupon that of socialism, for it naturally tends to reduce the relative\r\nimportance of environment. Those engaged in social uplift and in\r\nrevolutionary movements are therefore usually very intolerant of the\r\nlimitations imposed by heredity. Discussion of these limitations is also\r\nmost offensive to the advocates of the obliteration, under the guise of\r\ninternationalism, of all existing distinctions based on nationality,\r\nlanguage, race, religion and class. Those individuals who have neither\r\ncountry, nor flag, nor language, nor class, nor even surnames of their\r\nown and who can only acquire them by gift or assumption, very naturally\r\ndecry and sneer at the value of these attributes of the higher types.\r\n\r\nDemocratic theories of government in their modern form are based on\r\ndogmas of equality formulated some hundred and fifty years ago and rest\r\nupon the assumption that environment and not heredity is the controlling\r\nfactor in human development. Philanthropy and noble purpose dictated the\r\ndoctrine expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the document\r\nwhich to-day constitutes the actual basis of American institutions. The\r\nmen who wrote the words, “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that\r\nall men are created equal,” were themselves the owners of slaves and\r\ndespised Indians as something less than human. Equality in their minds\r\nmeant merely that they were just as good Englishmen as their brothers\r\nacross the sea. The words “that all men are created equal” have since\r\nbeen subtly falsified by adding the word “free,” although no such\r\nexpression is found in the original document and the teachings based on\r\nthese altered words in the American public schools of to-day would\r\nstartle and amaze the men who formulated the Declaration.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary for the reader to divest his mind of all\r\npreconceptions as to race, since modern anthropology, when applied to\r\nhistory, involves an entire change of definition. We must, first of all,\r\nrealize that race pure and simple, the physical and psychical structure\r\nof man, is something entirely distinct from either nationality or\r\nlanguage. Furthermore, race lies at the base of all the manifestation of\r\nmodern society, just as it has done throughout the unrecorded eons of\r\nthe past and the laws of nature operate with the same relentless and\r\nunchanging force in human affairs as in the phenomena of inanimate\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of existing European populations, viewed in the light\r\nthrown upon their origins by the discoveries of the last few decades,\r\nenables us to carry back history and prehistory into periods so remote\r\nthat the classic world is but of yesterday. The living peoples of Europe\r\nconsist of layer upon layer of diverse racial elements in varying\r\nproportions and historians and anthropologists, while studying these\r\npopulations, have been concerned chiefly with the recent strata and have\r\nneglected the more ancient and submerged types.\r\n\r\nAboriginal populations from time immemorial have been again and again\r\nswamped under floods of newcomers and have disappeared for a time from\r\nhistoric view. In the course of centuries, however, these primitive\r\nelements have slowly reasserted their physical type and have gradually\r\nbred out their conquerors, so that the racial history of Europe has been\r\nin the past, and is to-day, a story of the repression and resurgence of\r\nancient races.\r\n\r\nInvasions of new races have ordinarily arrived in successive waves, the\r\nearlier ones being quickly absorbed by the conquered, while the later\r\narrivals usually maintain longer the purity of their type. Consequently\r\nthe more recent elements are found in a less mixed state than the older\r\nand the more primitive strata of the population always contain physical\r\ntraits derived from still more ancient predecessors.\r\n\r\nMan has inhabited Europe in some form or other for hundreds of thousands\r\nof years and during all this lapse of time the population has been as\r\ndense as the food supply permitted. Tribes in the hunting stage are\r\nnecessarily of small size, no matter how abundant the game and in the\r\nPaleolithic period man probably existed only in specially favorable\r\nlocalities and in relatively small communities.\r\n\r\nIn the Neolithic and Bronze periods domesticated animals and the\r\nknowledge of agriculture, although of primitive character, afforded an\r\nenlarged food supply and the population in consequence greatly\r\nincreased. The lake dwellers of the Neolithic were, for example,\r\nrelatively numerous. With the clearing of the forests and the draining\r\nof the swamps during the Middle Ages and, above all, with the industrial\r\nexpansion of the last century the population multiplied with great\r\nrapidity. We can, of course, form little or no estimate of the numbers\r\nof the Paleolithic population of Europe and not much more of those of\r\nNeolithic times, but even the latter must have been very small in\r\ncomparison with the census of to-day.\r\n\r\nSome conception of the growth of population in recent times may be based\r\non the increase in England. It has been computed that Saxon England at\r\nthe time of the Conquest contained about 1,500,000 inhabitants, at the\r\ntime of Queen Elizabeth the population was about 4,000,000, while in\r\n1911 the census gave for the same area some 35,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe immense range of the subject of race in connection with history from\r\nits nebulous dawn and the limitations of space, require that\r\ngeneralizations must often be stated without mention of exceptions.\r\nThese sweeping statements may even appear to be too bold, but they rest,\r\nto the best of the writer’s belief, upon solid foundations of facts or\r\nelse are legitimate conclusions from evidence now in hand. In a science\r\nas recent as modern anthropology, new facts are constantly revealed and\r\nrequire the modification of existing hypotheses. The more the subject is\r\nstudied, the more provisional even the best-sustained theory appears,\r\nbut modern research opens a vista of vast interest and significance to\r\nman, now that we have discarded the shackles of former false viewpoints\r\nand are able to discern, even though dimly, the solution of many of the\r\nproblems of race. In the future new data will inevitably expand and\r\nperhaps change our ideas, but such facts as are now in hand and the\r\nconclusions based thereupon are provisionally set forth in the following\r\nchapters and necessarily often in a dogmatic form.\r\n\r\nThe statements relating to time have presented the greatest difficulty,\r\nas the authorities differ widely, but the dates have been fixed with\r\nextreme conservatism and the writer believes that whatever changes in\r\nthem are hereafter required by further investigation and study, will\r\nresult in pushing them back and not forward in prehistory. The dates\r\ngiven in the chapter on “Paleolithic Man” are frankly taken from the\r\nmost recent authority on this subject, “The Men of the Old Stone Age,”\r\nby Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn and the writer desires to take this\r\nopportunity to acknowledge his great indebtedness to this source of\r\ninformation, as well as to Mr. M. Taylor Pyne and to Mr. Charles Stewart\r\nDavison for their assistance and many helpful suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe author also wishes to acknowledge his obligation to Prof. William Z.\r\nRipley’s “The Races of Europe,” which contains a large array of\r\nanthropological measurements, maps and type portraits, providing\r\nvaluable data for the present distribution of the three primary races of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe American Geographical Society and its staff, particularly Mr. Leon\r\nDominian, have also been of great help in the preparation of the maps\r\nherein contained and this occasion is taken by the writer to express his\r\nappreciation for their assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH REVISED EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addition of a Documentary Supplement to the latest revision of this\r\nbook has been made in response to a persistent demand for “authorities.”\r\n\r\nThe author has endeavored to make the references and quotations in this\r\nSupplement very full and, so far as possible, interesting in themselves\r\nas well as entirely distinct from the text, which stands substantially\r\nunchanged, and the authorities quoted are not necessarily the sources of\r\nthe views herein expressed but more often are given in support of them.\r\nThe contents of the book, since its first appearance, have had the\r\nadvantage of the criticism of virtually every anthropologist in America\r\nand in England, France and Italy—many of whom have furnished the author\r\nwith valuable corroborative material. Some of this material appears in\r\nthe notes, but accessible authorities and the classical writers have\r\nbeen given the more prominent place. The supplement covered, as first\r\nprepared, substantially every statement in the book, but much was\r\nafterward omitted because it would seem that some things could be taken\r\nwithout proof.\r\n\r\n“The Passing of the Great Race,” in its original form, was designed by\r\nthe author to rouse his fellow-Americans to the overwhelming importance\r\nof race and to the folly of the “Melting Pot” theory, even at the\r\nexpense of bitter controversy. This purpose has been accomplished\r\nthoroughly, and one of the most far-reaching effects of the doctrines\r\nenunciated in this volume and in the discussions that followed its\r\npublication was the decision of the Congress of the United States to\r\nadopt discriminatory and restrictive measures against the immigration of\r\nundesirable races and peoples.\r\n\r\nAnother of the results has been the publication in America and Europe of\r\na series of books and articles more or less anthropological in character\r\nwhich have sustained or controverted its main theme. The new definition\r\nof race and the controlling rôle played by race in all the\r\nmanifestations of what we call civilization are now generally accepted\r\neven by those whose political position depends upon popular favor.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that there would be bitter opposition to those\r\ndefinitions of race which are based on physical and psychical characters\r\nthat are immutable, rather than upon those derived from language or\r\npolitical allegiance, that are easily altered.\r\n\r\nTo admit the unchangeable differentiation of race in its modern\r\nscientific meaning is to admit inevitably the existence of superiority\r\nin one race and of inferiority in another. Such an admission we can\r\nhardly expect from those of inferior races. These inferior races and\r\nclasses are prompt to recognize in such an admission the very real\r\ndanger to themselves of being relegated again to their former obscurity\r\nand subordinate position in society. The favorite defense of these\r\ninferior classes is an unqualified denial of the existence of fixed\r\ninherited qualities, either physical or spiritual, which cannot be\r\nobliterated or greatly modified by a change of environment. Failing in\r\nthis, as they must necessarily fail, they point out the presence of\r\nmixed or intermediate types, and claim that in these mixtures, or blends\r\nas they choose to call them, the higher type tends to predominate. In\r\nfact, of course, the exact opposite is the case and it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to cite the universal distrust, often contempt, that the\r\nhalf-breed between two sharply contrasted races inspires the world over.\r\nBelonging physically and spiritually to the lower race, but aspiring to\r\nrecognition as one of the higher race, the unfortunate mongrel, in\r\naddition to a disharmonic physique, often inherits from one parent an\r\nunstable brain which is stimulated and at times overexcited by flashes\r\nof brilliancy from the other. The result is a total lack of continuity\r\nof purpose, an intermittent intellect goaded into spasmodic outbursts of\r\nenergy. Physical and psychical disharmonies are common among crosses\r\nbetween Indians, negroes and whites, but where the parents are more\r\nclosely related racially we often obtain individuals occupying the\r\nborder-land between genius and insanity.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of all these racial mixtures is a lack of\r\nharmony—both physical and mental—in the first few generations. Then, if\r\nthe strain survives, it is by the slow reversion to one of the parent\r\ntypes—almost inevitably the lower.\r\n\r\nThe temporary advantage of mere numbers enjoyed by the inferior classes\r\nin modern democracies can only be made permanent by the destruction of\r\nsuperior types—by massacre, as in Russia, or by taxation, as in England.\r\nIn the latter country the financial burdens of the war and the selfish\r\ninterests of labor have imposed such a load of taxation upon the upper\r\nand middle classes that marriage and children are becoming increasingly\r\nburdensome.\r\n\r\nThe best example of complete elimination of a dominant class is in Santo\r\nDomingo. The horrors of the black revolt were followed by the slow death\r\nof the culture of the white man. This history should be studied\r\ncarefully because it gives in prophetic form the sequence of events that\r\nwe may expect to find in Mexico and in parts of South America where the\r\nreplacement of the higher type by the resurgent native is taking place.\r\n\r\nIn the countries inhabited by a population more or less racially uniform\r\nthe phenomenon of the multiplication of the inferior classes fostered\r\nand aided by the noble but fatuous philanthropy of the well-to-do\r\neverywhere appears. Nature’s laws when unchecked maintain a relatively\r\nfixed ratio between the classes, which is greatly impaired in modern\r\nsociety by humanitarian and charitable activities. The resurgence of\r\ninferior races and classes throughout not merely Europe but the world,\r\nis evident in every despatch from Egypt, Ireland, Poland, Rumania, India\r\nand Mexico. It is called nationalism, patriotism, freedom and other\r\nhigh-sounding names, but it is everywhere the phenomenon of the\r\nlong-suppressed, conquered servile classes rising against the master\r\nrace. The late Peloponnesian War in the world at large, like the Civil\r\nWar in America, has shattered the prestige of the white race and it will\r\ntake several generations and perhaps wars to recover its former control,\r\nif it ever does regain it. The danger is from within and not from\r\nwithout. Neither the black, nor the brown, nor the yellow, nor the red\r\nwill conquer the white in battle. But if the valuable elements in the\r\nNordic race mix with inferior strains or die out through race suicide,\r\nthen the citadel of civilization will fall for mere lack of defenders.\r\n\r\nOne of the curious effects of democracy is the unquestionable fact that\r\nthere is less freedom of the press than under autocratic forms of\r\ngovernment. It is well-nigh impossible to publish in the American\r\nnewspapers any reflection upon certain religions or races which are\r\nhysterically sensitive even when mentioned by name. The underlying idea\r\nseems to be that if publication can be suppressed the facts themselves\r\nwill ultimately disappear. Abroad, conditions are fully as bad, and we\r\nhave the authority of one of the most eminent anthropologists in France\r\nthat the collection of anthropological measurements and data among\r\nFrench recruits at the outbreak of the Great War was prevented by Jewish\r\ninfluence, which aimed to suppress any suggestion of racial\r\ndifferentiation in France. In the United States also, during the war, we\r\nwere unable to obtain complete measurements and data, in spite of the\r\nself-devotion of certain scientists, like Drs. Davenport, Sullivan and\r\nothers. This failure was due to lack of time and equipment and not to\r\nracial influences, but in the near future we may confidently expect in\r\nthis country strenuous opposition to any public discussion of race as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly growing appreciation of the importance of race during the\r\nlast few years, the study of the influence of race on nationality as\r\nshown by the after-war disputes over boundaries, the increasing\r\ncomplexity of our own problems between the whites and blacks, between\r\nthe Americans and Japs, and between the native Americans and the\r\nhyphenated aliens in our midst upon whom we have carelessly urged\r\ncitizenship, and, above all, the recognition that the leaders of labor\r\nand their more zealous followers are almost all foreigners, have served\r\nto arouse Americans to a realization of the menace of the impending\r\nMigration of Peoples through unrestrained freedom of entry here. The\r\ndays of the Civil War and the provincial sentimentalism which governed\r\nor misgoverned our public opinion are past, and this generation must\r\ncompletely repudiate the proud boast of our fathers that they\r\nacknowledged no distinction in “race, creed, or color,” or else the\r\nnative American must turn the page of history and write:\r\n\r\n                            “FINIS AMERICÆ”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PASSING OF THE GREAT RACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _PART I_\r\n                     RACE, LANGUAGE AND NATIONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n                           RACE AND DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure to recognize the clear distinction between race and nationality\r\nand the still greater distinction between race and language and the easy\r\nassumption that the one is indicative of the other have been in the past\r\nserious impediments to an understanding of racial values. Historians and\r\nphilologists have approached the subject from the viewpoint of\r\nlinguistics and as a result we are to-day burdened with a group of\r\nmythical races, such as the Latin, the Aryan, the Indo-Germanic, the\r\nCaucasian and, perhaps, most inconsistent of all, the Celtic race.\r\n\r\nMan is an animal differing from his fellow inhabitants of the globe not\r\nin kind but only in degree of development and an intelligent study of\r\nthe human species must be preceded by an extended knowledge of other\r\nmammals, especially the primates. Instead of such essential training,\r\nanthropologists often seek to qualify by research in linguistics,\r\nreligion or marriage customs or in designs of pottery or blanket\r\nweaving, all of which relate to ethnology alone. As a result the\r\ninfluence of environment is often overestimated and overstated at the\r\nexpense of heredity.\r\n\r\nThe question of race has been further complicated by the effort of\r\nold-fashioned theologians to cramp all mankind into the scant six\r\nthousand years of Hebrew chronology as expounded by Archbishop Ussher.\r\nReligious teachers have also maintained the proposition not only that\r\nman is something fundamentally distinct from other living creatures, but\r\nthat there are no inherited differences in humanity that cannot be\r\nobliterated by education and environment.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary at the outset for the reader to appreciate\r\nthoroughly that race, language and nationality are three separate and\r\ndistinct things and that in Europe these three elements are found only\r\noccasionally persisting in combination, as in the Scandinavian nations.\r\n\r\nTo realize the transitory nature of political boundaries one has but to\r\nconsider the changes which have occurred during the past century and as\r\nto language, here in America we hear daily the English language spoken\r\nby many men who possess not one drop of English blood and who, a few\r\nyears since, knew not one word of Saxon speech.\r\n\r\nAs a result of certain religious and social doctrines, now happily\r\nbecoming obsolete, race consciousness has been greatly impaired among\r\ncivilized nations but in the beginning all differences of class, of\r\ncaste and of color marked actual lines of race cleavage.\r\n\r\nIn many countries the existing classes represent races that were once\r\ndistinct. In the city of New York and elsewhere in the United States\r\nthere is a native American aristocracy resting upon layer after layer of\r\nimmigrants of lower races and these native Americans, while, of course,\r\ndisclaiming the distinction of a patrician class and lacking in class\r\nconsciousness and class dignity, have, nevertheless, up to this time\r\nsupplied the leaders in thought and in the control of capital as well as\r\nof education and of the religious ideals and altruistic bias of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn the democratic forms of government the operation of universal\r\nsuffrage tends toward the selection of the average man for public office\r\nrather than the man qualified by birth, education and integrity. How\r\nthis scheme of administration will ultimately work out remains to be\r\nseen but from a racial point of view it will inevitably increase the\r\npreponderance of the lower types and cause a corresponding loss of\r\nefficiency in the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in a democracy is toward a standardization of type and a\r\ndiminution of the influence of genius. A majority must of necessity be\r\ninferior to a picked minority and it always resents specializations in\r\nwhich it cannot share. In the French Revolution the majority, calling\r\nitself “the people,” deliberately endeavored to destroy the higher type\r\nand something of the same sort was in a measure done after the American\r\nRevolution by the expulsion of the Loyalists and the confiscation of\r\ntheir lands, with a resultant loss to the growing nation of good race\r\nstrains, which were in the next century replaced by immigrants of far\r\nlower type.\r\n\r\nIn America we have nearly succeeded in destroying the privilege of\r\nbirth; that is, the intellectual and moral advantage a man of good stock\r\nbrings into the world with him. We are now engaged in destroying the\r\nprivilege of wealth; that is, the reward of successful intelligence and\r\nindustry and in some quarters there is developing a tendency to attack\r\nthe privilege of intellect and to deprive a man of the advantage gained\r\nfrom an early and thorough classical education. Simplified spelling is a\r\nstep in this direction. Ignorance of English grammar or classic learning\r\nmust not, forsooth, be held up as a reproach to the political or social\r\naspirant.\r\n\r\nMankind emerged from savagery and barbarism under the leadership of\r\nselected individuals whose personal prowess, capacity or wisdom gave\r\nthem the right to lead and the power to compel obedience. Such leaders\r\nhave always been a minute fraction of the whole, but as long as the\r\ntradition of their predominance persisted they were able to use the\r\nbrute strength of the unthinking herd as part of their own force and\r\nwere able to direct at will the blind dynamic impulse of the slaves,\r\npeasants or lower classes. Such a despot had an enormous power at his\r\ndisposal which, if he were benevolent or even intelligent, could be used\r\nand most frequently was used for the general uplift of the race. Even\r\nthose rulers who most abused this power put down with merciless rigor\r\nthe antisocial elements, such as pirates, brigands or anarchists, which\r\nimpair the progress of a community, as disease or wounds cripple an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nTrue aristocracy or a true republic is government by the wisest and\r\nbest, always a small minority in any population. Human society is like a\r\nserpent dragging its long body on the ground, but with the head always\r\nthrust a little in advance and a little elevated above the earth. The\r\nserpent’s tail, in human society represented by the antisocial forces,\r\nwas in the past dragged by sheer strength along the path of progress.\r\nSuch has been the organization of mankind from the beginning, and such\r\nit still is in older communities than ours. What progress humanity can\r\nmake under the control of universal suffrage, or the rule of the\r\naverage, may find a further analogy in the habits of certain snakes\r\nwhich wiggle sideways and disregard the head with its brains and eyes.\r\nSuch serpents, however, are not noted for their ability to make rapid\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nA true republic, the function of which is administration in the\r\ninterests of the whole community—in contrast to a pure democracy, which\r\nin last analysis is the rule of the demos or a majority in its own\r\ninterests—should be, and often is, the medium of selection for the\r\ntechnical task of government of those best qualified by antecedents,\r\ncharacter and education, in short, of experts.\r\n\r\nTo use another simile, in an aristocratic as distinguished from a\r\nplutocratic or democratic organization the intellectual and talented\r\nclasses form the point of the lance while the massive shaft represents\r\nthe body of the population and adds by its bulk and weight to the\r\npenetrative impact of the tip. In a democratic system this concentrated\r\nforce is dispersed throughout the mass. It supplies, to be sure, a\r\ncertain amount of leaven but in the long run the force and genius of the\r\nsmall minority is dissipated, and its efficiency lost. _Vox populi_, so\r\nfar from being _Vox Dei_, thus becomes an unending wail for rights and\r\nnever a chant of duty.\r\n\r\nWhere a conquering race is imposed on another race the institution of\r\nslavery often arises to compel the servient race to work and to\r\nintroduce it forcibly to a higher form of civilization. As soon as men\r\ncan be induced to labor to supply their own needs slavery becomes\r\nwasteful and tends to vanish. From a material point of view slaves are\r\noften more fortunate than freemen when treated with reasonable humanity\r\nand when their elemental wants of food, clothing and shelter are\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nThe Indians around the fur posts in northern Canada were formerly the\r\nvirtual bond slaves of the Hudson Bay Company, each Indian and his squaw\r\nand pappoose being adequately supplied with simple food and equipment.\r\nHe was protected as well against the white man’s rum as the red man’s\r\nscalping parties and in return gave the Company all his peltries—the\r\nwhole product of his year’s work. From an Indian’s point of view this\r\nwas nearly an ideal condition but was to all intents serfdom or slavery.\r\nWhen through the opening up of the country the continuance of such an\r\narchaic system became an impossibility, the Indian sold his furs to the\r\nhighest bidder, received a large price in cash and then wasted the\r\nproceeds in trinkets instead of blankets and in rum instead of flour,\r\nwith the result that he is now gloriously free but is on the highroad to\r\nbecoming a diseased outcast. In this case of the Hudson Bay Indian the\r\nadvantages of the upward step from serfdom to freedom are not altogether\r\nclear. A very similar condition of vassalage existed until recently\r\namong the peons of Mexico, but without the compensation of the control\r\nof an intelligent and provident ruling class.\r\n\r\nIn the same way serfdom in mediæval Europe apparently was a device\r\nthrough which the landowners repressed the nomadic instinct in their\r\ntenantry which became marked when the fertility of the land declined\r\nafter the dissolution of the Roman Empire. Years are required to bring\r\nland to its highest productivity and agriculture cannot be successfully\r\npractised even in well-watered and fertile districts by farmers who\r\ncontinually drift from one locality to another. The serf or villein was,\r\ntherefore, tied by law to the land and could not leave except with his\r\nmaster’s consent. As soon as the nomadic instinct was eliminated serfdom\r\nvanished. One has but to read the severe laws against vagrancy in\r\nEngland just before the Reformation to realize how widespread and\r\nserious was this nomadic instinct. Here in America we have not yet\r\nforgotten the wandering instincts of our Western pioneers, which in that\r\ncase proved beneficial to every one except the migrants.\r\n\r\nWhile democracy is fatal to progress when two races of unequal value\r\nlive side by side, an aristocracy may be equally injurious whenever, in\r\norder to purchase a few generations of ease and luxury, slaves or\r\nimmigrants are imported to do the heavy work. It was a form of\r\naristocracy that brought slaves to the American colonies and the West\r\nIndies and if there had been an aristocratic form of governmental\r\ncontrol in California, Chinese coolies and Japanese laborers would now\r\nform the controlling element, so far as numbers are concerned, on the\r\nPacific coast.\r\n\r\nIt was the upper classes who encouraged the introduction of immigrant\r\nlabor to work American factories and mines and it is the native American\r\ngentleman who builds a palace on the country side and who introduces as\r\nservants all manner of foreigners into purely American districts. The\r\nfarming and artisan classes of America did not take alarm until it was\r\ntoo late and they are now seriously threatened with extermination in\r\nmany parts of the country. In Rome, also, it was the plebeian, who first\r\nwent under in the competition with slaves but the patrician followed in\r\nhis turn a few generations later.\r\n\r\nThe West Indian sugar planters flourished in the eighteenth century and\r\nproduced some strong men; to-day from the same causes they have vanished\r\nfrom the scene.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century the New England manufacturer imported the Irish\r\nand French Canadians and the resultant fall in the New England birth\r\nrate at once became ominous. The refusal of the native American to work\r\nwith his hands when he can hire or import serfs to do manual labor for\r\nhim is the prelude to his extinction and the immigrant laborers are now\r\nbreeding out their masters and killing by filth and by crowding as\r\neffectively as by the sword.\r\n\r\nThus the American sold his birthright in a continent to solve a labor\r\nproblem. Instead of retaining political control and making citizenship\r\nan honorable and valued privilege, he intrusted the government of his\r\ncountry and the maintenance of his ideals to races who have never yet\r\nsucceeded in governing themselves, much less any one else.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this advance of democracy and the transfer of power from\r\nthe higher to the lower races, from the intellectual to the plebeian\r\nclass, we find the spread of socialism and the recrudescence of obsolete\r\nreligious forms. Although these phenomena appear to be contradictory,\r\nthey are in reality closely related since both represent reactions from\r\nthe intense individualism which a century ago was eminently\r\ncharacteristic of Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                       THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the modern and scientific study of race we have long since discarded\r\nthe Adamic theory that man is descended from a single pair, created a\r\nfew thousand years ago in a mythical Garden of Eden somewhere in Asia,\r\nto spread later over the earth in successive waves.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, that Asia was the chief area of evolution and\r\ndifferentiation of man and that the various groups had their main\r\ndevelopment there and not on the peninsula we call Europe.\r\n\r\nMany of the races of Europe, both living and extinct, did come from the\r\nEast through Asia Minor or by way of the African littoral, but most of\r\nthe direct ancestors of existing populations have inhabited Europe for\r\nmany thousands of years. During that time numerous races of men have\r\npassed over the scene. Some undoubtedly have utterly vanished and some\r\nhave left their blood behind them in the Europeans of to-day.\r\n\r\nWe now know, since the elaboration of the Mendelian Laws of Inheritance,\r\nthat certain bodily characters, such as skull shape, stature, eye color,\r\nhair color and nose form, some of which are so-called unit characters,\r\nare transmitted in accordance with fixed laws, and, further, that\r\nvarious characters which are normally correlated or linked together in\r\npure races may, after a prolonged admixture of races, pass down\r\nseparately and form what is known as disharmonic combinations. Such\r\ndisharmonic combinations are, for example, a tall brunet or a short\r\nblond; blue eyes associated with brunet hair or brown eyes with blond\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nThe process of intermixture of characters has gone far in existing\r\npopulations and through the ease of modern methods of transportation\r\nthis process is going much further in Europe and in America. The results\r\nof such mixture are not blends or intermediate types, but rather mosaics\r\nof contrasted characters. Such blends, if any, as ultimately occur are\r\ntoo remote to concern us here.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of an individual of pure brunet race with an individual of\r\npure blond race produces in the first generation offspring which are\r\ndistinctly dark. In subsequent generations, brunets and blonds appear in\r\nvarious proportions but the former tend to be much the more numerous.\r\nThe blond is consequently said to be recessive to the brunet because it\r\nrecedes from view in the first generation. This or any similar recessive\r\nor suppressed trait is not lost to the germ plasm, but reappears in\r\nlater generations of the hybridized stock. A similar rule prevails with\r\nother physical characters.\r\n\r\nIn defining race in Europe it is necessary not only to consider pure\r\ngroups or pure types but also the distribution of characters belonging\r\nto each particular subspecies of man found there. The interbreeding of\r\nthese populations has progressed to such an extent that in many cases\r\nsuch an analysis of physical characters is necessary to reconstruct the\r\nelements which have entered into their ethnic composition. To rely on\r\naverages alone leads to misunderstanding and to disregard of the\r\nrelative proportion of pure, as contrasted with mixed types.\r\n\r\nSometimes we find a character appearing here and there as the sole\r\nremnant of a once numerous race, for example, the rare appearance in\r\nEuropean populations of a skull of the Neanderthal type, a race widely\r\nspread over Europe 40,000 years ago, or of the Cro-Magnon type, the\r\npredominant race 16,000 years ago. Before the fossil remains of the\r\nNeanderthal and Cro-Magnon races were studied and understood such\r\nreversional specimens were considered pathological, instead of being\r\nrecognized as the reappearance of an ancient and submerged type.\r\n\r\nThese physical characters are to all intents and purposes immutable and\r\nthey do not change during the lifetime of a language or an empire. The\r\nskull shape of the Egyptian fellaheen, in the unchanging environment of\r\nthe Nile Valley, is absolutely identical in measurements, proportions\r\nand capacity with skulls found in the pre-dynastic tombs dating back\r\nmore than six thousand years.\r\n\r\nThere exists to-day a widespread and fatuous belief in the power of\r\nenvironment, as well as of education and opportunity to alter heredity,\r\nwhich arises from the dogma of the brotherhood of man, derived in its\r\nturn from the loose thinkers of the French Revolution and their American\r\nmimics. Such beliefs have done much damage in the past and if allowed to\r\ngo uncontradicted, may do even more serious damage in the future. Thus\r\nthe view that the Negro slave was an unfortunate cousin of the white\r\nman, deeply tanned by the tropic sun and denied the blessings of\r\nChristianity and civilization, played no small part with the\r\nsentimentalists of the Civil War period and it has taken us fifty years\r\nto learn that speaking English, wearing good clothes and going to school\r\nand to church do not transform a Negro into a white man. Nor was a\r\nSyrian or Egyptian freedman transformed into a Roman by wearing a toga\r\nand applauding his favorite gladiator in the amphitheatre. Americans\r\nwill have a similar experience with the Polish Jew, whose dwarf stature,\r\npeculiar mentality and ruthless concentration on self-interest are being\r\nengrafted upon the stock of the nation.\r\n\r\nRecent attempts have been made in the interest of inferior races among\r\nour immigrants to show that the shape of the skull does change, not\r\nmerely in a century, but in a single generation. In 1910, the report of\r\nthe anthropological expert of the Congressional Immigration Commission\r\ngravely declared that a round skull Jew on his way across the Atlantic\r\nmight and did have a round skull child; but a few years later, in\r\nresponse to the subtle elixir of American institutions as exemplified in\r\nan East Side tenement, might and did have a child whose skull was\r\nappreciably longer; and that a long skull south Italian, breeding\r\nfreely, would have precisely the same experience in the reverse\r\ndirection. In other words the Melting Pot was acting instantly under the\r\ninfluence of a changed environment.\r\n\r\nWhat the Melting Pot actually does in practice can be seen in Mexico,\r\nwhere the absorption of the blood of the original Spanish conquerors by\r\nthe native Indian population has produced the racial mixture which we\r\ncall Mexican and which is now engaged in demonstrating its incapacity\r\nfor self-government. The world has seen many such mixtures and the\r\ncharacter of a mongrel race is only just beginning to be understood at\r\nits true value.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the specializations which characterize the\r\nhigher races are of relatively recent development, are highly unstable\r\nand when mixed with generalized or primitive characters tend to\r\ndisappear. Whether we like to admit it or not, the result of the mixture\r\nof two races, in the long run, gives us a race reverting to the more\r\nancient, generalized and lower type. The cross between a white man and\r\nan Indian is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a\r\nNegro; the cross between a white man and a Hindu is a Hindu; and the\r\ncross between any of the three European races and a Jew is a Jew.\r\n\r\nIn the crossing of the blond and brunet elements of a population, the\r\nmore deeply rooted and ancient dark traits are prepotent or dominant.\r\nThis is matter of everyday observation and the working of this law of\r\nnature is not influenced or affected by democratic institutions or by\r\nreligious beliefs. Nature cares not for the individual nor how he may be\r\nmodified by environment. She is concerned only with the perpetuation of\r\nthe species or type and heredity alone is the medium through which she\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nAs measured in terms of centuries these characters are fixed and rigid\r\nand the only benefit to be derived from a changed environment and better\r\nfood conditions is the opportunity afforded a race which has lived under\r\nadverse conditions to achieve its maximum development but the limits of\r\nthat development are fixed for it by heredity and not by environment.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with European populations the best method of determining race\r\nhas been found to lie in a comparison of proportions of the skull, the\r\nso-called cephalic index. This is the ratio of maximum _width_, taken at\r\nthe widest part of the skull above the ears, to maximum _length_. Skulls\r\nwith an index of 75 or less, that is, those with a width that is\r\nthree-fourths of the length or less, are considered dolichocephalic or\r\nlong skulls. Skulls of an index of 80 or over are round or\r\nbrachycephalic skulls. Intermediate indices, between 75 and 80, are\r\nconsidered mesaticephalic. These are cranial indices. To allow for the\r\nflesh on living specimens about two per cent is to be added to this\r\nindex and the result is the cephalic index. In the following pages only\r\nlong and round skulls are considered and the intermediate forms are\r\nassigned to the dolichocephalic group.\r\n\r\nThis cephalic index, though an extremely important if not the\r\ncontrolling character, is, nevertheless, but a single character and must\r\nbe checked up with other somatological traits. Normally, a long skull is\r\nassociated with a long face and a round skull with a round face.\r\n\r\nThe use of this test, the cephalic index, enables us to divide the great\r\nbulk of the European populations into three distinct subspecies of man,\r\none northern and one southern, both dolichocephalic or characterized by\r\na long skull and a central subspecies which is brachycephalic or\r\ncharacterized by a round skull.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Nordic or Baltic subspecies. This race is long skulled,\r\nvery tall, fair skinned with blond or brown hair and light colored eyes.\r\nThe Nordics inhabit the countries around the North and Baltic Seas and\r\ninclude not only the great Scandinavian and Teutonic groups, but also\r\nother early peoples who first appear in southern Europe and in Asia as\r\nrepresentatives of Aryan language and culture.\r\n\r\nThe second is the dark Mediterranean or Iberian subspecies, occupying\r\nthe shores of the inland sea and extending along the Atlantic coast\r\nuntil it reaches the Nordic species. It also spreads far east into\r\nsouthern Asia. It is long skulled like the Nordic race but the absolute\r\nsize of the skull is less. The eyes and hair are very dark or black and\r\nthe skin more or less swarthy. The stature is distinctly less than that\r\nof the Nordic race and the musculature and bony framework weak.\r\n\r\nThe third is the Alpine subspecies occupying all central and eastern\r\nEurope and extending through Asia Minor to the Hindu Kush and the\r\nPamirs. The Armenoids constitute an Alpine subdivision and may possibly\r\nrepresent the ancestral type of this race which remained in the\r\nmountains and high plateaux of Anatolia and western Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Alpines are round skulled, of medium height and sturdy build both as\r\nto skeleton and muscles. The coloration of both hair and eyes was\r\noriginally very dark and still tends strongly in that direction but many\r\nlight colored eyes, especially gray, are now common among the Alpine\r\npopulations of western Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile the inhabitants of Europe betray as a whole their mixed origin,\r\nnevertheless, individuals of each of the three main subspecies are found\r\nin large numbers and in great purity, as well as sparse remnants of\r\nstill more ancient races represented by small groups or by individuals\r\nand even by single characters.\r\n\r\nThese three main groups have bodily characters which constitute them\r\ndistinct subspecies. Each group is a large one and includes several\r\nwell-marked varieties, which differ even more widely in cultural\r\ndevelopment than in physical divergence so that when the Mediterranean\r\nof England is compared with the Hindu, or the Alpine Savoyard with the\r\nRumanian or Turcoman, a wide gulf is found.\r\n\r\nIn zoology, related species when grouped together constitute subgenera\r\nand genera and the term species implies the existence of a certain\r\ndefinite amount of divergence from the most closely related type but\r\nrace does not require a similar amount of difference. In man, where all\r\ngroups are more or less fertile when crossed, so many intermediate or\r\nmixed types occur that the word species has at the present day too\r\nextended a meaning.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness the word race and not the word species or\r\nsubspecies will be used in the following chapters as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that fertility or infertility of races of animals was the\r\nmeasure of species is now abandoned. One of the greatest difficulties in\r\nclassifying man is his perverse predisposition to mismate. This is a\r\nmatter of daily observation, especially among the women of the better\r\nclasses, probably because of their wider range of choice.\r\n\r\nThere must have existed many subspecies and species, if not genera, of\r\nmen since the Pliocene and new discoveries of their remains may be\r\nexpected at any time and in any part of the eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe cephalic index is of less value in the classification of Asiatic\r\npopulations but the distribution of round and long skulls is similar to\r\nthat in Europe. The vast central plateau of that continent is inhabited\r\nby round skulls. In fact, Thibet and the western Himalayas were probably\r\nthe centre of radiation of all the round skulls of the world. In India\r\nand Persia south of this central area occurs a long skull race related\r\nto Mediterranean man in Europe.\r\n\r\nBoth skull types occur much intermixed among the American Indians and\r\nthe cephalic index is of little value in classifying the Amerinds. No\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the variability of the skull shape in the\r\nwestern hemisphere has as yet been found, but the total range of\r\nvariation of physical characters among them, from northern Canada to\r\nsouthern Patagonia, is less than the range of such variation from\r\nNormandy to Provence in France.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the cephalic index is also of small classification value\r\nbecause all of the populations are characterized by a long skull.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a long skull and a round skull in mankind\r\nprobably goes back at least to early Paleolithic times, if not to a\r\nperiod still more remote. It is of such great antiquity that when new\r\nspecies or races appear in Europe at the close of the Paleolithic,\r\nbetween 10,000 and 7,000 years B. C., the skull characters among them\r\nare as clearly defined as they are to-day.\r\n\r\nThe fact that two distinct species of mankind have long skulls, as have\r\nthe north European and the African Negro, is no necessary indication of\r\nrelationship and in that instance is merely a case of parallel\r\nspecialization, but the fact, however, that the Swede has a long skull\r\nand the Savoyard a round skull does prove them to be racially distinct.\r\n\r\nThe claim that the Nordic race is a mere variation of the Mediterranean\r\nrace and that the latter is in turn derived from the Ethiopian Negro\r\nrests upon a mistaken idea that a dolichocephaly in common must mean\r\nidentity of origin, as well as upon a failure to take into consideration\r\nmany somatological characters of almost equal value with the cephalic\r\nindex. Indeed, the cephalic index, being merely a ratio, may be\r\nidentical for skulls differing in every other proportion and detail, as\r\nwell as in absolute size and capacity.\r\n\r\nEye color is of very great importance in race determination because all\r\nblue, gray or green eyes in the world to-day came originally from the\r\nsame source, namely, the Nordic race of northern Europe. This light\r\ncolored eye has appeared nowhere else on earth, is a specialization of\r\nthis subspecies of man only and consequently is of extreme value in the\r\nclassification of European races. Dark colored eyes are all but\r\nuniversal among wild mammals and entirely so among the primates, man’s\r\nnearest relatives. It may be taken as an absolute certainty that all the\r\noriginal races of man had dark eyes.\r\n\r\nOne subspecies of man and one alone specialized in light colored eyes.\r\nThis same subspecies also evolved light brown or blond hair, a character\r\nfar less deeply rooted than eye color, as blond children tend to grow\r\ndarker with advancing years and populations partly of Nordic extraction,\r\nsuch as those of Lombardy, upon admixture with darker races lose their\r\nblond hair more readily than their light colored eyes. In short, light\r\ncolored eyes are far more common than light colored hair. In crosses\r\nbetween Alpines and Nordics, the Alpine stature and the Nordic eye\r\nappear to prevail. Light color in eyes is largely due to a greater or\r\nless absence of pigment but it is not associated with weak eyesight, as\r\nin the case of Albinos. In fact, among marksmen, it has been noted that\r\nnearly all the great rifle-shots in England or America have had light\r\ncolored eyes.\r\n\r\nBlond hair also comes everywhere from the Nordic subspecies and from\r\nnowhere else. Whenever we find blondness among the darker races of the\r\nearth we may be sure some Nordic wanderer has passed that way. When\r\nindividuals of perfect blond type occur, as sometimes in Greek islands,\r\nwe may suspect a recent visit of sailors from a passing ship but when\r\nonly single characters remain spread thinly, but widely, over\r\nconsiderable areas, like the blondness of the Atlas Berbers or of the\r\nAlbanian mountaineers, we must search in the dim past for the origin of\r\nthese blurred traits of early invaders.\r\n\r\nThe range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen\r\nand red to shades of chestnut and brown. The darker shades may indicate\r\ncrossing in some cases, but absolutely black hair certainly does mean an\r\nancestral cross with a dark race—in England with the Mediterranean race.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a\r\nfinal test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also\r\nthose of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other\r\nNordic characters. In this sense the word “blond” means those lighter\r\nshades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades\r\nwhich are termed brunet. The meaning of “blond” as now used is therefore\r\nnot limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech.\r\n\r\nIn England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of\r\nindividuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or\r\nchestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and\r\nAmericans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and\r\nis frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of\r\n“blond” aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as\r\nmembers of the Nordic race.\r\n\r\nIn Nordic populations the women are, in general, lighter haired than the\r\nmen, a fact which points to a blond past and a darker future for those\r\npopulations. Women in all human races, as the females among all mammals,\r\ntend to exhibit the older, more generalized and primitive traits of the\r\npast of the race. The male in his individual development indicates the\r\ndirection in which the race is tending under the influence of variation\r\nand selection.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in connection with the more primitive physique\r\nof the female, that in the spiritual sphere also women retain the\r\nancient and intuitive knowledge that the great mass of mankind is not\r\nfree and equal but bond and unequal.\r\n\r\nThe color of the skin is a character of importance but one that is\r\nexceedingly hard to measure as the range of variation in Europe between\r\nskins of extreme fairness and those that are exceedingly swarthy is\r\nalmost complete. The Nordic race in its purity has an absolutely fair\r\nskin and is consequently the white man par excellence.\r\n\r\nMany members of the Nordic race otherwise apparently pure have skins, as\r\nwell as hair, more or less dark, so that the determinative value of this\r\ncharacter is uncertain. There can be no doubt that the quality of the\r\nskin and the extreme range of its variation in color from black, brown,\r\nred, yellow to ivory-white are excellent measures of the specific or\r\nsubgeneric distinctions between the larger groups of mankind but in\r\ndealing with European populations it is sometimes difficult to correlate\r\nthe shades of fairness with other physical characters.\r\n\r\nIn general, hair color and skin color are linked together, but it often\r\nhappens that an individual with all other Nordic characters in great\r\npurity has a skin of an olive or dark tint. Even more frequently we find\r\nindividuals with absolutely pure brunet traits in possession of a skin\r\nof almost ivory whiteness and of great clarity. This last combination is\r\nvery frequent among the brunets of the British Isles. That these are, to\r\nsome extent, disharmonic combinations we may be certain but beyond that\r\nour knowledge does not lead. Women, however, of fair skin have always\r\nbeen the objects of keen envy by those of the sex whose skins are black,\r\nyellow or red.\r\n\r\nStature is another character of greater value than skin color and,\r\nperhaps, than hair color and is one of much importance in European\r\nclassification for on that continent we have the most extreme variations\r\nof human height.\r\n\r\nExceedingly adverse economic conditions may inhibit a race from\r\nattaining the full measure of its growth and to this extent environment\r\nplays its part in determining stature but fundamentally it is race,\r\nalways race, that sets the limit. The tall Scot and the dwarfed\r\nSardinian owe their respective sizes to race and not to oatmeal or olive\r\noil. It is probable, however, that the fact that the stature of the\r\nIrish is, on the average, shorter than that of the Scotch is due partly\r\nto economic conditions and partly to the depressive effect of a\r\nconsiderable population of primitive short stock.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean race is everywhere marked by a relatively short\r\nstature, sometimes greatly depressed, as in south Italy and in Sardinia,\r\nand also by a comparatively light bony framework and feeble muscular\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine race is taller than the Mediterranean, although shorter than\r\nthe Nordic, and is characterized by a stocky and sturdy build. The\r\nAlpines rarely, if ever, show the long necks and graceful figures so\r\noften found in the other two races.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic race is nearly everywhere distinguished by great stature.\r\nAlmost the tallest stature in the world is found among the pure Nordic\r\npopulations of the Scottish and English borders while the native British\r\nof Pre-Nordic brunet blood are for the most part relatively short. No\r\none can question the race value of stature who observes on the streets\r\nof London the contrast between the Piccadilly gentleman of Nordic race\r\nand the cockney costermonger of the old Neolithic type.\r\n\r\nIn some cases where these three European races have become mixed stature\r\nseems to be one of the first Nordic characters to vanish, but wherever\r\nin Europe we find great stature in a population otherwise lacking in\r\nNordic characters we may suspect a Nordic crossing, as in the case of a\r\nlarge proportion of the inhabitants of Burgundy, of the Tyrol and of the\r\nDalmatian Alps south to Albania.\r\n\r\nThese four characters, skull shape, eye color, hair color and stature,\r\nare sufficient to enable us to differentiate clearly between the three\r\nmain subspecies of Europe, but if we wish to discuss the minor\r\nvariations in each race and mixtures between them, we must go much\r\nfurther and take up other proportions of the skull than the cephalic\r\nindex, as well as the shape and position of the eyes, the proportions\r\nand shape of the jaws, the chin and other features.\r\n\r\nThe nose is an exceedingly important character. The original human nose\r\nwas, of course, broad and bridgeless. This trait is shown clearly in\r\nnew-born infants who recapitulate in their development the various\r\nstages of the evolution of the human genus. A bridgeless nose with wide,\r\nflaring nostrils is a very primitive character and is still retained by\r\nsome of the larger divisions of mankind throughout the world. It appears\r\noccasionally in white populations of European origin but is everywhere a\r\nvery ancient, generalized and low character.\r\n\r\nThe high bridge and long, narrow nose, the so-called Roman, Norman or\r\naquiline nose, is characteristic of the most highly specialized races of\r\nmankind. While an apparently unimportant character, this feature is one\r\nof the very best clews to racial origin and in the details of its form,\r\nand especially in the lateral shape of the nostrils, is a race\r\ndeterminant of the greatest value.\r\n\r\nThe lips, whether thin or fleshy or whether clean-cut or everted, are\r\nrace characters. Thick, protruding, everted lips are very ancient traits\r\nand are characteristic of many primitive races. A high instep also has\r\nlong been esteemed an indication of patrician type while the flat foot\r\nis often the test of lowly origin.\r\n\r\nThe absence or abundance of hair and beard and the relative absence or\r\nabundance of body hair are characters of no little value in\r\nclassification. Abundant body hair is, to a large extent, peculiar to\r\npopulations of the very highest as well as the very lowest species,\r\nbeing characteristic of the north European as well as of the Australian\r\nsavages. It merely means the retention in both these groups of a very\r\nearly and primitive trait which has been lost by the Negroes, Mongols\r\nand Amerinds.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic and Alpine races are far better equipped with head and body\r\nhair than the Mediterranean, which is throughout its range a glabrous or\r\nrelatively naked race but among the Nordics the extreme blond types are\r\nless equipped with body hair or down than are darker members of the\r\nrace. A contrast in color between head hair and beard, the latter always\r\nbeing lighter than the former, may be one of the results of an ancient\r\ncrossing of races.\r\n\r\nThe so-called red-haired branch of the Nordic race has special\r\ncharacters in addition to red hair, such as a greenish cast of eye, a\r\nskin of delicate texture tending either to great clarity or to freckles\r\nand certain peculiar temperamental traits. This was probably a variety\r\nclosely related to the blonds and it first appears in history in\r\nassociation with them.\r\n\r\nWhile the three main European races are the subject of this book and\r\nwhile it is not the intention of the author to deal with the other human\r\ntypes, it is desirable in connection with the discussion of this\r\ncharacter, hair, to state that the three European subspecies are\r\nsubdivisions of one of the primary groups or species of the genus _Homo_\r\nwhich, taken together, we may call the Caucasian for lack of a better\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe existing classification of man must be radically revised, as the\r\ndifferences between the most divergent human types are far greater than\r\nare usually deemed sufficient to constitute separate species and even\r\nsubgenera in the animal kingdom at large. Outside of the three European\r\nsubspecies the greater portion of the genus _Homo_ can be roughly\r\ndivided into the Negroes and Negroids, and the Mongols and Mongoloids.\r\n\r\nThe former apparently originated in south Asia and entered Africa by way\r\nof the northeastern corner of that continent. Africa south of the Sahara\r\nis now the chief home of this race, though remnants of Negroid\r\naborigines are found throughout south Asia from India to the\r\nPhilippines, while the very distinct black Melanesians and the\r\nAustraloids lie farther to the east and south.\r\n\r\nThe Mongoloids include the round skulled Mongols and their derivatives,\r\nthe Amerinds or American Indians. This group is essentially Asiatic and\r\noccupies the centre and the eastern half of that continent.\r\n\r\nA description of these Negroids and Mongoloids and their derivatives, as\r\nwell as of certain aberrant species of man, lies outside the scope of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the head hair of all races of mankind we find a\r\nregular progression from extreme kinkiness to lanky straightness and\r\nthis straightness or curliness depends on the shape of the cross section\r\nof the hair itself. This cross section has three distinct forms,\r\ncorresponding with the most extreme divergences among human species.\r\n\r\nThe cross section of the hair of the Negroes is a flat ellipse with the\r\nresult that they all have kinky hair. This kinkiness of the Negroes’\r\nhair is also due somewhat to the acute angle at which the hair is set\r\ninto the skin and the peppercorn form of hair probably represents an\r\nextreme specialization.\r\n\r\nThe cross section of the hair of the Mongols and their derivatives, the\r\nAmerinds, is a complete circle and their hair is perfectly straight and\r\nlank.\r\n\r\nThe cross section of the hair of the so-called Caucasians, including the\r\nMediterranean, Alpine and Nordic subspecies, is an oval ellipse and\r\nconsequently is intermediate between the cross-sections of the Negroes\r\nand Mongoloids. Hair of this structure is wavy or curly, never either\r\nkinky or absolutely straight and is characteristic of all the European\r\npopulations almost without exception.\r\n\r\nOf these three hair types the straighter forms most closely represent\r\nthe earliest human form of hair.\r\n\r\nWe have confined the discussion to the most important characters but\r\nthere are many other valuable aids to classification to be found in the\r\nproportions of the body and the relative length of the limbs. In this\r\nlatter respect, it is a matter of common knowledge that there occur two\r\ndistinct types, the one long legged and short bodied, the other long\r\nbodied and short legged.\r\n\r\nWithout going into further physical details, it is probable that all\r\nrelative proportions in the body, the features, the skeleton and the\r\nskull which are fixed and constant and lie outside of the range of\r\nindividual variation represent dim inheritances from the past. Every\r\ngeneration of human beings carries the blood of thousands of ancestors,\r\nstretching back through thousands of years, superimposed upon a prehuman\r\ninheritance of still greater antiquity and the face and body of every\r\nliving man offer an intricate mass of hieroglyphs that science will some\r\nday learn to read and interpret.\r\n\r\nOnly the foregoing main characters will be used as the basis for\r\ndetermining race and attention will be called later to such\r\ntemperamental and spiritual traits as seem to be associated with\r\ndistinct physical types.\r\n\r\nWe shall discuss only European populations and, as said, shall not deal\r\nwith exotic and alien races scattered among them nor with those quarters\r\nof the globe where the races of man are such that other physical\r\ncharacters must be called upon to provide clear definitions.\r\n\r\nA fascinating subject would open up if we were to dwell upon the effect\r\nof racial combinations and disharmonies, as, for instance, where the\r\nmixed Nordic and Alpine populations of Lombardy usually retain the skull\r\nshape, hair color and stature of the Alpine race, with the light eye\r\ncolor of the Nordic race, or where the mountain populations along the\r\neast coast of the Adriatic from the Tyrol to Albania have the stature of\r\nthe Nordic race and an Alpine skull and coloration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n                            RACE AND HABITAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws which govern the distribution of the various races of man and\r\ntheir evolution through selection are substantially the same as those\r\ncontrolling the evolution and distribution of the larger mammals.\r\n\r\nMan, however, with his superior mentality has freed himself from many of\r\nthe conditions which impose restraint upon the expansion of animals. In\r\nhis case selection through disease and social and economic competition\r\nhas largely replaced selection through adjustment to the limitations of\r\nfood supply.\r\n\r\nMan is the most cosmopolitan of animals and in one form or another\r\nthrives in the tropics and in the arctics, at sea level and on high\r\nplateaux, in the desert and in the reeking forests of the equator.\r\nNevertheless, the various races of Europe have each a certain natural\r\nhabitat in which it achieves its highest development.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE NORDIC HABITAT\r\n\r\nThe Nordics appear in their present centre of distribution, the basin of\r\nthe Baltic, at the close of the Paleolithic, as soon as the retreating\r\nglaciers left habitable land. This race was probably at that time in\r\npossession of its fundamental characters, and its extension from the\r\nplains of Russia to Scandinavia was not in the nature of a radical\r\nchange of environment. The race in consequence is now, always has been\r\nand probably always will be, adjusted to certain environmental\r\nconditions, chief of which is protection from a tropical sun. The\r\nactinic rays of the sun at the same latitude are uniform in strength the\r\nworld over and continuous sunlight affects adversely the delicate\r\nnervous organization of the Nordics. The fogs and long winter nights of\r\nthe North serve as a protection from too much sun and from its too\r\ndirect rays.\r\n\r\nScarcely less important is the presence of a large amount of moisture\r\nbut above all a constant variety of temperature is needed. Sharp\r\ncontrast between night and day temperature and between summer and winter\r\nare necessary to maintain the vigor of the Nordic race at a high pitch.\r\nUniform weather, if long continued, lessens its energy. Too great\r\nextremes as in midwinter or midsummer in parts of New England are\r\ninjurious. Limited but constant alternations of heat and cold, of\r\nmoisture and dryness, of sun and clouds, of calm and cyclonic storms\r\noffer the ideal surroundings.\r\n\r\nWhere the environment is too soft and luxurious and no strife is\r\nrequired for survival, not only are weak strains and individuals allowed\r\nto survive and encouraged to breed but the strong types also grow fat\r\nmentally and physically, like overfed Indians on reservations or\r\nwingless birds on oceanic islands, which have lost the power of flight\r\nas a result of prolonged protective conditions.\r\n\r\nMen of the Nordic race may not enjoy the fogs and snows of the North,\r\nthe endless changes of weather and the violent fluctuations of the\r\nthermometer and they may seek the sunny southern isles, but under the\r\nformer conditions they flourish, do their work and raise their families.\r\nIn the south they grow listless and cease to breed.\r\n\r\nIn the lower classes in the Southern States of America the increasing\r\nproportion of “poor whites” and “crackers” are symptoms of lack of\r\nclimatic adjustment. The whites in Georgia, in the Bahamas and, above\r\nall, in Barbadoes are excellent examples of the deleterious effects of\r\nresidence outside the natural habitat of the Nordic race.\r\n\r\nThe poor whites of the Cumberland Mountains in Kentucky and Tennessee\r\npresent a more difficult problem, because here the altitude, even though\r\nmoderate, should modify the effects of latitude and the climate of these\r\nmountains cannot be particularly unfavorable to men of Nordic breed.\r\nThere are probably other hereditary forces at work there as yet little\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nNo doubt bad food and economic conditions, prolonged inbreeding and the\r\nloss through emigration of the best elements have played a large part in\r\nthe degeneration of these mountaineers. They represent to a large extent\r\nthe offspring of indentured servants brought over by the rich planters\r\nin early Colonial times and their names indicate that many of them are\r\nthe descendants of the old borderers along the Scotch and English\r\nfrontier. The persistence with which family feuds are maintained\r\ncertainly points to such an origin. The physical type is typically\r\nNordic, for the most part pure Saxon or Anglian, and the whole mountain\r\npopulation show somewhat aberrant but very pronounced physical, moral\r\nand mental characteristics which would repay scientific investigation.\r\nThe problem is too complex to be disposed of by reference to the\r\nhookworm, illiteracy or competition with Negroes.\r\n\r\nThis type played a large part in the settlement of the Middle West, by\r\nway of Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri. Thence they passed both up the\r\nMissouri River and down the Santa Fé trail and contributed rather more\r\nthan their share of the train robbers, horse thieves and bad men of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nScotland and the Bahamas are inhabited by men of precisely the same\r\nrace, but the vigor of the English in the Bahamas is gone and the beauty\r\nof their women has faded. The fact that they were not in competition\r\nwith an autochthonous race better adjusted to climatic conditions has\r\nenabled them to survive, but the type could not have persisted, even\r\nduring the last two hundred years, if they had been compelled to compete\r\non terms of equality with a native and acclimated population.\r\n\r\nAnother element entering into racial degeneration on many other islands\r\nand for that matter in many New England villages, is the loss through\r\nemigration of the more vigorous and energetic individuals, leaving\r\nbehind the less efficient to continue the race at home.\r\n\r\nIn subtropical countries where the energy of the Nordics is at a low ebb\r\nit would appear that the racial inheritance of physical strength and\r\nmental vigor was suppressed and recessive rather than destroyed. Many\r\nindividuals born in unfavorable climatic surroundings, who move back to\r\nthe original habitat of their race in the north, recover their full\r\nquota of energy and vigor. New York and other Northern cities have many\r\nSoutherners who are fully as efficient as pure Northerners.\r\n\r\nThis Nordic race can exist outside of its native environment as land\r\nowning aristocrats who are not required to do manual labor in the fields\r\nunder a blazing sun. As such an aristocracy it continues to exist under\r\nItalian skies, but as a field laborer the man of Nordic blood cannot\r\ncompete with his Alpine or Mediterranean rival. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat the various Nordic tribes and armies, which for a thousand years\r\nafter the fall of Rome poured down from the Alps like the glaciers to\r\nmelt in the southern sun, were composed solely of knights and gentlemen\r\nwho became the landed nobility of Italy. The man in the ranks also took\r\nup his land and work in Italy, but he had to compete directly with the\r\nnative under climatic conditions which were unfavorable to his race. In\r\nthis competition the blue eyed Nordic giant died and the native\r\nsurvived. His officer, however, lived in the castle and directed the\r\nlabor of his bondsmen without other preoccupation than the chase and war\r\nand he long maintained his vigor.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in our South before the Civil War. There the\r\nwhite men did not work in the fields or in the factory. The heavy work\r\nunder the blazing sun was carried on by Negro slaves and the planter was\r\nspared exposure to an unfavorable environment. Under these conditions he\r\nwas able to retain much of his vigor. When slavery was abolished and the\r\nwhite man had to plough his own fields or work in the factory\r\ndeterioration began.\r\n\r\nThe change in type of the men who are now sent by the Southern States to\r\nrepresent them in the Federal Government from their predecessors in\r\nante-bellum times is partly due to these causes, but in greater degree\r\nit is to be attributed to the fact that a large portion of the best\r\nracial strains in the South were killed off during the Civil War. In\r\naddition the war shattered the aristocratic traditions which formerly\r\nsecured the selection of the best men as rulers. The new democratic\r\nideals, with universal suffrage in free operation among the whites,\r\nresult in the choice of representatives who lack the distinction and\r\nability of the leaders of the Old South.\r\n\r\nA race may be thoroughly adjusted to a certain country at one stage of\r\nits development and be at a disadvantage when an economic change occurs,\r\nsuch as was experienced in England a century ago when the nation changed\r\nfrom an agricultural to a manufacturing community. The type of man that\r\nflourishes in the fields is not the type of man that thrives in the\r\nfactory, just as the type of man required for the crew of a sailing ship\r\nis not the type useful as stokers on a modern steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE HABITAT OF THE ALPINES AND MEDITERRANEANS\r\n\r\nThe environment of the Alpine race seems to have always been the\r\nmountainous country of central and eastern Europe, as well as western\r\nAsia, but they are now spreading into the plains, notably in Poland and\r\nRussia. This type has never flourished in the deserts of Arabia or the\r\nSahara, nor has it succeeded well in maintaining its early colonies in\r\nthe northwest of Europe within the domain of the Nordic long heads. It\r\nis, however, a sturdy and persistent stock and, while much of it may not\r\nbe overrefined or cultured, undoubtedly possesses great potentialities\r\nfor future development.\r\n\r\nThe Alpines in the west of Europe, especially in Switzerland and the\r\ndistricts immediately surrounding, have been so thoroughly Nordicized\r\nand so saturated with the culture of the adjoining nations that they\r\nstand in sharp contrast to backward Alpines of Slavic speech in the\r\nBalkans and east of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean race, on the other hand, is clearly a southern type\r\nwith eastern affinities. It is a type that did not endure in the north\r\nof Europe under former agricultural conditions nor is it suitable to the\r\nfarming districts and frontiers of America and Canada. It is adjusted to\r\nsubtropical and tropical countries better than any other European type\r\nand will flourish in our Southern States and around the coasts of the\r\nSpanish Main. In France it is well known that members of the\r\nMediterranean race are better adapted for colonization in Algeria than\r\nare French Alpines or Nordics. This subspecies of man is notoriously\r\nintolerant of extreme cold, owing to its susceptibility to diseases of\r\nthe lungs and it shrinks from the blasts of the northern winter in which\r\nthe Nordics revel.\r\n\r\nThe brunet Mediterranean element in the native American seems to be\r\nincreasing at the expense of the blond Nordic element generally\r\nthroughout the Southern States and probably also in the large cities.\r\nThis type of man, however, is scarce on our frontiers. In the Northwest\r\nand in Alaska in the days of the gold rush it was in the mining camps a\r\nmatter of comment if a man turned up with dark eyes, so universal were\r\nblue and gray eyes among the American pioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n                        THE COMPETITION OF RACES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere two races occupy a country side by side, it is not correct to\r\nspeak of one type as changing into the other. Even if present in equal\r\nnumbers one of the two contrasted types will have some small advantage\r\nor capacity which the other lacks toward a perfect adjustment to\r\nsurroundings. Those possessing these favorable variations will flourish\r\nat the expense of their rivals and their offspring will not only be more\r\nnumerous, but will also tend to inherit such variations. In this way one\r\ntype gradually breeds the other out. In this sense, and in this sense\r\nonly, do races change.\r\n\r\nMan continuously undergoes selection through the operation of the forces\r\nof social environment. Among native Americans of the Colonial period a\r\nlarge family was an asset and social pressure and economic advantage\r\ncounselled both early marriage and numerous children. Two hundred years\r\nof continuous political expansion and material prosperity changed these\r\nconditions and children, instead of being an asset to till the fields\r\nand guard the cattle, became an expensive liability. They now require\r\nsupport, education and endowment from their parents and a large family\r\nis regarded by some as a serious handicap in the social struggle.\r\n\r\nThese conditions do not obtain at first among immigrants, and large\r\nfamilies among the newly arrived population are still the rule,\r\nprecisely as they were in Colonial America and are to-day in French\r\nCanada where backwoods conditions still prevail.\r\n\r\nThe result is that one class or type in a population expands more\r\nrapidly than another and ultimately replaces it. This process of\r\nreplacement of one type by another does not mean that the race changes\r\nor is transformed into another. It is a replacement pure and simple and\r\nnot a transformation.\r\n\r\nThe lowering of the birth rate among the most valuable classes, while\r\nthe birth rate of the lower classes remains unaffected, is a frequent\r\nphenomenon of prosperity. Such a change becomes extremely injurious to\r\nthe race if unchecked, unless nature is allowed to maintain by her own\r\ncruel devices the relative numbers of the different classes in their due\r\nproportions. To attack race suicide by encouraging indiscriminate\r\nreproduction is not only futile but is dangerous if it leads to an\r\nincrease in the undesirable elements. What is needed in the community\r\nmost of all is an increase in the desirable classes, which are of\r\nsuperior type physically, intellectually and morally and not merely an\r\nincrease in the absolute numbers of the population.\r\n\r\nThe value and efficiency of a population are not numbered by what the\r\nnewspapers call souls, but by the proportion of men of physical and\r\nintellectual vigor. The small Colonial population of America was, on an\r\naverage and man for man, far superior to the present inhabitants,\r\nalthough the latter are twenty-five times more numerous. The ideal in\r\neugenics toward which statesmanship should be directed is, of course,\r\nimprovement in quality rather than quantity. This, however, is at\r\npresent a counsel of perfection and we must face conditions as they are.\r\n\r\nThe small birth rate in the upper classes is to some extent offset by\r\nthe care received by such children as are born and the better chance\r\nthey have to become adult and breed in their turn. The large birth rate\r\nof the lower classes is under normal conditions offset by a heavy infant\r\nmortality, which eliminates the weaker children.\r\n\r\nWhere altruism, philanthropy or sentimentalism intervene with the\r\nnoblest purpose and forbid nature to penalize the unfortunate victims of\r\nreckless breeding, the multiplication of inferior types is encouraged\r\nand fostered. Indiscriminate efforts to preserve babies among the lower\r\nclasses often result in serious injury to the race. At the existing\r\nstage of civilization, the legalizing of birth control would probably be\r\nof benefit by reducing the number of offspring in the undesirable\r\nclasses. Regulation of the number of children is, for good or evil, in\r\nfull operation among the better classes and its recognition by the state\r\nwould result in no further harm among them.\r\n\r\nMistaken regard for what are believed to be divine laws and a\r\nsentimental belief in the sanctity of human life tend to prevent both\r\nthe elimination of defective infants and the sterilization of such\r\nadults as are themselves of no value to the community. The laws of\r\nnature require the obliteration of the unfit and human life is valuable\r\nonly when it is of use to the community or race.\r\n\r\nIt is highly unjust that a minute minority should be called upon to\r\nsupply brains for the unthinking mass of the community, but it is even\r\nworse to burden the responsible and larger but still overworked elements\r\nin the community with an ever increasing number of moral perverts,\r\nmental defectives and hereditary cripples. As the percentage of\r\nincompetents increases, the burden of their support will become ever\r\nmore onerous until, at no distant date, society will in self-defense put\r\na stop to the supply of feebleminded and criminal children of weaklings.\r\n\r\nThe church assumes a serious responsibility toward the future of the\r\nrace whenever it steps in and preserves a defective strain. The marriage\r\nof deaf mutes was hailed a generation ago as a triumph of humanity. Now\r\nit is recognized as an absolute crime against the race. A great injury\r\nis done to the community by the perpetuation of worthless types. These\r\nstrains are apt to be meek and lowly and as such make a strong appeal to\r\nthe sympathies of the successful. Before eugenics were understood much\r\ncould be said from a Christian and humane viewpoint in favor of\r\nindiscriminate charity for the benefit of the individual. The societies\r\nfor charity, altruism or extension of rights, should have in these days,\r\nhowever, in their management some small modicum of brains, otherwise\r\nthey may continue to do, as they have sometimes done in the past, more\r\ninjury to the race than black death or smallpox.\r\n\r\nAs long as such charitable organizations confine themselves to the\r\nrelief of suffering individuals, no matter how criminal or diseased they\r\nmay be, no harm is done except to our own generation and if modern\r\nsociety recognizes a duty to the humblest malefactors or imbeciles that\r\nduty can be harmlessly performed in full, provided they be deprived of\r\nthe capacity to procreate their defective strain.\r\n\r\nThose who read these pages will feel that there is little hope for\r\nhumanity, but the remedy has been found, and can be quickly and\r\nmercifully applied. A rigid system of selection through the elimination\r\nof those who are weak or unfit—in other words, social failures—would\r\nsolve the whole question in a century, as well as enable us to get rid\r\nof the undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals and insane asylums.\r\nThe individual himself can be nourished, educated and protected by the\r\ncommunity during his lifetime, but the state through sterilization must\r\nsee to it that his line stops with him or else future generations will\r\nbe cursed with an ever increasing load of victims of misguided\r\nsentimentalism. This is a practical, merciful and inevitable solution of\r\nthe whole problem and can be applied to an ever widening circle of\r\nsocial discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased and\r\nthe insane and extending gradually to types which may be called\r\nweaklings rather than defectives and perhaps ultimately to worthless\r\nrace types.\r\n\r\nEfforts to increase the birth rate of the genius producing classes of\r\nthe community, while most desirable, encounter great difficulties. In\r\nsuch efforts we encounter social conditions over which we have as yet no\r\ncontrol. It was tried two thousand years ago by Augustus and his efforts\r\nto avert race suicide and the extinction of the old Roman stock were\r\nsingularly prophetic of what some far seeing men are attempting in order\r\nto preserve the race of native Americans of Colonial descent.\r\n\r\nMan has the choice of two methods of race improvement. He can breed from\r\nthe best or he can eliminate the worst by segregation or sterilization.\r\nThe first method was adopted by the Spartans, who had for their national\r\nideals military efficiency and the virtues of self-control, and along\r\nthese lines the results were completely successful. Under modern social\r\nconditions it would be extremely difficult in the first instance to\r\ndetermine which were the most desirable types, except in the most\r\ngeneral way and even if a satisfactory selection were finally made, it\r\nwould be in a democracy a virtual impossibility to limit by law the\r\nright to breed to a privileged and chosen few.\r\n\r\nInteresting efforts to improve the quality as well as the quantity of\r\nthe population, however, will probably be made in more than one country\r\nafter the war has ended.\r\n\r\nExperiments in limiting reproduction to the undesirable classes were\r\nunconsciously made in mediæval Europe under the guidance of the church.\r\nAfter the fall of Rome social conditions were such that all those who\r\nloved a studious and quiet life were compelled to seek refuge from the\r\nviolence of the times in monastic institutions and upon such the church\r\nimposed the obligation of celibacy and thus deprived the world of\r\noffspring from these desirable classes.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, through persecution resulting in actual death, life\r\nimprisonment and banishment, the free thinking, progressive and\r\nintellectual elements were persistently eliminated over large areas,\r\nleaving the perpetuation of the race to be carried on by the brutal, the\r\nservile and the stupid. It is now impossible to say to what extent the\r\nRoman Church by these methods has impaired the brain capacity of Europe,\r\nbut in Spain alone, for a period of over three centuries from the years\r\n1471 to 1781, the Inquisition condemned to the stake or imprisonment an\r\naverage of 1,000 persons annually. During these three centuries no less\r\nthan 32,000 were burned alive and 291,000 were condemned to various\r\nterms of imprisonment and other penalties and 17,000 persons were burned\r\nin effigy, representing men who had died in prison or had fled the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNo better method of eliminating the genius producing strains of a nation\r\ncould be devised and if such were its purpose the result was eminently\r\nsatisfactory, as is demonstrated by the superstitious and unintelligent\r\nSpaniard of to-day. A similar elimination of brains and ability took\r\nplace in northern Italy, in France and in the Low Countries, where\r\nhundreds of thousands of Huguenots were murdered or driven into exile.\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions the most practical and hopeful method of race\r\nimprovement is through the elimination of the least desirable elements\r\nin the nation by depriving them of the power to contribute to future\r\ngenerations. It is well known to stock breeders that the color of a herd\r\nof cattle can be modified by continuous destruction of worthless shades\r\nand of course this is true of other characters. Black sheep, for\r\ninstance, have been practically obliterated by cutting out generation\r\nafter generation all animals that show this color phase, until in\r\ncarefully maintained flocks a black individual only appears as a rare\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nIn mankind it would not be a matter of great difficulty to secure a\r\ngeneral consensus of public opinion as to the least desirable, let us\r\nsay, ten per cent of the community. When this unemployed and\r\nunemployable human residuum has been eliminated together with the great\r\nmass of crime, poverty, alcoholism and feeblemindedness associated\r\ntherewith it would be easy to consider the advisability of further\r\nrestricting the perpetuation of the then remaining least valuable types.\r\nBy this method mankind might ultimately become sufficiently intelligent\r\nto choose deliberately the most vital and intellectual strains to carry\r\non the race.\r\n\r\nIn addition to selection by climatic environment man is now, and has\r\nbeen for ages, undergoing selection through disease. He has been\r\ndecimated throughout the centuries by pestilences such as the black\r\ndeath and bubonic plague. In our fathers’ days yellow fever and smallpox\r\ncursed humanity. These plagues are now under control, but similar\r\ndiseases now regarded as mere nuisances to childhood, such as measles,\r\nmumps and scarlatina, are terrible scourges to native populations\r\nwithout previous experience with them. Add to these smallpox and other\r\nwhite men’s diseases and one has the great empire builders of yesterday.\r\nIt was not the swords in the hands of Columbus and his followers that\r\ndecimated the American Indians, it was the germs that his men and their\r\nsuccessors brought over, implanting the white man’s maladies in the red\r\nman’s world. Long before the arrival of the Puritans in New England,\r\nsmallpox had flickered up and down the coast until the natives were but\r\na broken remnant of their former numbers.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Nordic race is undergoing selection through\r\nalcoholism, a peculiarly Nordic vice, and through consumption. Both\r\nthese dread scourges unfortunately attack those members of the race that\r\nare otherwise most desirable, differing in this respect from filth\r\ndiseases like typhus, typhoid or smallpox. One has only to look among\r\nthe more desirable classes for the victims of rum and tubercule to\r\nrealize that death or mental and physical impairment through these two\r\ncauses have cost the race many of its most brilliant and attractive\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n                     RACE, LANGUAGE AND NATIONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nNationality is an artificial political grouping of population usually\r\ncentring around a single language as an expression of traditions and\r\naspirations. Nationality can, however, exist independently of language\r\nbut states thus formed, such as Belgium or Austria, are far less stable\r\nthan those where a uniform language is prevalent, as, for example,\r\nFrance or England.\r\n\r\nStates without a single national language are constantly exposed to\r\ndisintegration, especially where a substantial minority of the\r\ninhabitants speak a tongue which is predominant in an adjoining state\r\nand, as a consequence, tend to gravitate toward such state.\r\n\r\nThe history of the last century in Europe has been the record of a long\r\nseries of struggles to unite in one political unit all those speaking\r\nthe same or closely allied dialects. With the exception of internal and\r\nsocial revolutions, every European war since the Napoleonic period has\r\nbeen caused by the effort to bring about the unification either of Italy\r\nor of Germany or by the desperate attempts of the Balkan States to\r\nstruggle out of Turkish chaos into modern European nations on a basis of\r\ncommunity of language. The unification of both Italy and Germany is as\r\nyet incomplete according to the views held by their more advanced\r\npatriots and the solution of the Balkan question is still in the future.\r\n\r\nMen are keenly aware of their nationality and are very sensitive about\r\ntheir language, but only in a few cases, notably in Sweden and Germany,\r\ndoes any large section of the population possess anything analogous to\r\ntrue race consciousness, although the term “race” is everywhere misused\r\nto designate linguistic or political groups.\r\n\r\nThe unifying power of a common language works subtly and unceasingly. In\r\nthe long run it forms a bond which draws peoples together—as the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples of the British Empire with those of America. In\r\nthe same manner this linguistic sympathy will bring the German-speaking\r\nAustrians into a closer political community with the rest of Germany and\r\nwill hold together all the German-speaking provinces.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a section of the population of a large nation\r\ngathers around language, reinforced by religion, as an expression of\r\nindividuality. The struggle between the French-speaking Alpine Walloons\r\nand the Nordic Flemings of Low Dutch tongue in Belgium is an example of\r\ntwo competing languages in an artificial nation which was formed\r\noriginally around religion. On the other hand, the Irish National\r\nmovement centres chiefly around religion reinforced by myths of ancient\r\ngrandeur. The French Canadians and the Poles use both religion and\r\nlanguage to hold together what they consider a political unit. None of\r\nthese so-called nationalities are founded on race.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century side by side with the tendency to form imperial\r\nor large national groups, such as the Pan-Germanic, Pan-Slavic,\r\nPan-Rumanian or Italia Irredenta movements, there has appeared a counter\r\nmovement on the part of small disintegrating “nationalities” to reassert\r\nthemselves, such as the Bohemian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Irish, and\r\nEgyptian national revivals. The upheaval is usually caused, as in the\r\ncases of the Irish and the Serbians, by delusions of former greatness\r\nnow become national obsessions, but sometimes it means the resistance of\r\na small group of higher culture to absorption by a lower civilization.\r\nThe reassertion of these small nationalities is associated with the\r\nresurgence of the lower races at the expense of the Nordics.\r\n\r\nExamples of a high type threatened by a lower culture are afforded by\r\nthe Finlanders, who are trying to escape the dire fate of their\r\nneighbors across the Gulf of Finland—the Russification of the Germans\r\nand Swedes of the Baltic Provinces—and by the struggle of the Danes of\r\nSchleswig to escape Germanization. The Armenians, too, have resisted\r\nstoutly the pressure of Islam to force them away from their ancient\r\nChristian faith. This people really represents the last outpost of\r\nEurope toward the Mohammedan East and constitutes the best remaining\r\nmedium through which Western ideals and culture can be introduced into\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nIn these as in other cases, the process of absorption from the viewpoint\r\nof the world at large is good or evil exactly in proportion to the\r\nrelative value of the culture and race of the two groups. The world\r\nwould be no richer in civilization with an independent Bohemia or an\r\nenlarged Rumania; but, on the contrary, an independent Hungarian nation\r\nstrong enough to stand alone, a Finland self-governing or reunited to\r\nSweden, or an enlarged Greece would add greatly to the forces that make\r\nfor good government and progress. An independent Ireland worked out on a\r\nTammany model is not a pleasing prospect. A free Poland, apart from its\r\nvalue as a buffer state, might be actually a step backward. Poland was\r\nonce great, but the elements that made it so are scattered and gone and\r\nthe Poland of to-day is a geographical expression and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing lack of true race consciousness is probably due to the\r\nfact that every important nation in Europe as at present organized, with\r\nthe sole exception of the Iberian and Scandinavian states, possesses in\r\nlarge proportions representatives of at least two of the fundamental\r\nEuropean subspecies of man and of all manner of crosses between them. In\r\nFrance to-day, as in Cæsar’s Gaul, the three races divide the nation in\r\nunequal proportions.\r\n\r\nIn the future, however, with an increased knowledge of the correct\r\ndefinition of true human races and types and with a recognition of the\r\nimmutability of fundamental racial characters and of the results of\r\nmixed breeding, far more value will be attached to racial in contrast to\r\nnational or linguistic affinities. In marital relations the\r\nconsciousness of race will also play a much larger part than at present,\r\nalthough in the social sphere we shall have to contend with a certain\r\nstrange attraction for contrasted types. When it becomes thoroughly\r\nunderstood that the children of mixed marriages between contrasted races\r\nbelong to the lower type, the importance of transmitting in unimpaired\r\npurity the blood inheritance of ages will be appreciated at its full\r\nvalue and to bring half-breeds into the world will be regarded as a\r\nsocial and racial crime of the first magnitude. The laws against\r\nmiscegenation must be greatly extended if the higher races are to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe language that a man speaks may be nothing more than evidence that at\r\nsome time in the past his race has been in contact, either as conqueror\r\nor as conquered, with its original possessors. Postulating the Nordic\r\norigin and dissemination of the Proto-Aryan language, then in Asia and\r\nelsewhere existing Aryan speech on the lips of populations showing no\r\nsign of Nordic characters is to be considered evidence of a former\r\ndominance of Nordics now long vanished.\r\n\r\nOne has only to consider the spread of the language of Rome over the\r\nvast extent of her Empire to realize how few of those who speak to-day\r\nRomance tongues derive any portion of their blood from the pure Latin\r\nstock and the error of talking about a “Latin race” becomes evident.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, such a thing as a large group of nations which have a\r\nmutual understanding and sympathy based on the possession of a common or\r\nclosely related group of languages and on the culture of which it is the\r\nmedium. This assemblage maybe called the “Latin nations,” but never the\r\n“Latin race.”\r\n\r\n“Latin America” is a still greater misnomer as the great mass of the\r\npopulations of South and Central America is not even European and still\r\nless “Latin,” being overwhelmingly of Amerindian blood.\r\n\r\nIn the Teutonic group a large majority of those who speak Teutonic\r\nlanguages, as the English, Flemings, Dutch, North Germans and\r\nScandinavians, are descendants of the Nordic race while the dominant\r\nclass in Europe is everywhere of that blood.\r\n\r\nAs to the so-called “Celtic race,” the fantastic inapplicability of the\r\nterm is at once apparent when we consider that those populations on the\r\nborders of the Atlantic Ocean, who to-day speak Celtic dialects, are\r\ndivided into three groups, each one showing in great purity the\r\ncharacters of one of the three entirely distinct human subspecies found\r\nin Europe. To class together the Breton peasant with his round Alpine\r\nskull; the little, long skulled, brunet Welshman of Mediterranean race,\r\nand the tall, blond, light-eyed Scottish Highlander of pure Nordic\r\nblood, in a single group labelled Celtic is obviously impossible. These\r\npeoples have neither physical, mental nor cultural characteristics in\r\ncommon. If one be of “Celtic” blood then the other two are clearly of\r\ndifferent origin.\r\n\r\nThere was once a people who used the original Celtic language and they\r\nformed the western vanguard of the Nordic race. This people was spread\r\nall over central and western Europe prior to the irruption of the\r\nTeutonic tribes and were, no doubt, much mixed with Alpines among the\r\nlower classes. The descendants of these Celts must be sought to-day\r\namong those having the characters of the Nordic race and not elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn England the short, dark Mediterranean Welshman talks about being\r\n“Celtic,” quite unconscious that he is the residuum of Pre-Nordic races\r\nof immense antiquity. If the Celts are Mediterranean in race then they\r\nare absent from central Europe and we must regard as Celts all the\r\nBerbers and Egyptians, as well as many Persians and Hindus.\r\n\r\nIn France many anthropologists regard the Breton of Alpine blood in the\r\nsame light and ignore his remote Asiatic origin. If these Alpine Bretons\r\nare Celts then there is no substantial trace of their blood, in the\r\nBritish Isles, as round skulls are practically absent there and all the\r\nblond elements in England, Scotland and Ireland must be attributed to\r\nthe historic Teutonic invasions. Furthermore, we must call all the\r\ncontinental Alpines “Celts,” and must also include all Slavs, Armenians\r\nand other brachycephs of western Asia within that designation, which\r\nwould be obviously grotesque. The fact that the original Celts left\r\ntheir speech on the tongues of Mediterraneans in Wales and of Alpines in\r\nBrittany must not mislead us, as it indicates nothing more than that\r\nCeltic speech antedates the Anglo-Saxons in England and the Romans in\r\nFrance. We must once and for all time discard the name “Celt” for any\r\nexisting race whatever and speak only of “Celtic” language and culture.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the big, blond Nordic Danes claim the honor of the name of\r\n“Celt,” if honor it be, but they are fully as Nordic as the English and\r\nthe great mass of the Irish are of Danish, Norse and Anglo-Norman blood\r\nin addition to earlier and Pre-Nordic elements. We are all familiar with\r\nthe blond and the brunet type of Irishman. These represent precisely the\r\nsame racial elements as those which enter into the composition of the\r\nEnglish, namely, the tall Nordic blond and the little Mediterranean\r\nbrunet pure or combined with Paleolithic remnants. The Irish are\r\nconsequently not entitled to independent national existence on the\r\nground of race, but if there be any ground for political separation from\r\nEngland it must rest like that of Belgium on religion, a basis for\r\npolitical combinations now happily obsolete in communities well advanced\r\nin culture.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the so-called “Slavic race,” there is much more unity\r\nbetween racial type and language. It is true that in most\r\nSlavic-speaking countries the predominant race is clearly Alpine, except\r\nperhaps in Russia where there is a very large substratum of Nordic\r\ntype—which may be considered as Proto-Nordic. The objection which is\r\nmade to the identification of the Slavic race with the Alpine type rests\r\nchiefly on the fact that a very large portion of the Alpine race is\r\nGerman-speaking in Germany, Italian-speaking in Italy and\r\nFrench-speaking in central France. Moreover, large portions of Rumania\r\nare of exactly the same racial complexion.\r\n\r\nMany of the modern Greeks are also Alpines; in fact, are little more\r\nthan Byzantinized Slavs. It was through the Byzantine Empire that the\r\nSlavs first came in contact with the Mediterranean world and through\r\nthis Greek medium the Russians, the Serbians, the Rumanians and the\r\nBulgarians received their Christianity.\r\n\r\nSituated on the eastern marches of Europe, the Slavs were submerged\r\nduring long periods in the Middle Ages by Mongolian hordes and were\r\nchecked in development and warped in culture. Definite traces remain of\r\nthe blood of the Mongols both in isolated and compact groups in south\r\nRussia and also scattered throughout the whole country as far west as\r\nthe German boundary. The high tide of the Mongol invasion was during the\r\nthirteenth century. Three hundred years later the great Muscovite\r\nexpansion began, first over the steppes to the Urals and then across\r\nSiberian tundras and forests to the waters of the Pacific, taking up in\r\nits course much Mongolian blood, especially during the early stages of\r\nits advance.\r\n\r\nThe term “Caucasian race” has ceased to have any meaning except where it\r\nis used, in the United States, to contrast white populations with\r\nNegroes or Indians or in the Old World with Mongols. It is, however, a\r\nconvenient term to include the three European subspecies when considered\r\nas divisions of one of the primary branches or species of mankind but it\r\nis, at best, a cumbersome and archaic designation. The name “Caucasian”\r\narose a century ago from a false assumption that the cradle of the blond\r\nEuropeans was in the Caucasus where no traces are now found of any such\r\nrace, except a small and decreasing minority of blond traits among the\r\nOssetes, a tribe whose Aryan speech is related to that of the Armenians,\r\nand who while mainly brachycephalic still retain some blond and\r\ndolichocephalic elements which apparently are fading fast. The Ossetes\r\nnow have about thirty per cent fair eyes and ten per cent fair hair.\r\nThey are supposed to be to some extent a remnant of the Alans, the\r\neasternmost Teutonic tribe and closely related to the Goths. Both Alans\r\nand Goths very early in the Christian era occupied southern Russia, and\r\nwere the latest known Nordics in the vicinity of the Caucasus Mountains.\r\nIf these Ossetes are not partly of Alan origin they may possibly\r\nrepresent the last lingering trace of ancient Scythian dolichocephalic\r\nblondness.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “Indo-European or Indo-Germanic race” is also of little use.\r\nIf it has any meaning at all it must include all the three European\r\nraces as well as members of the Mediterranean race in Persia and India.\r\nThe use of this name also involves a false assumption of blood\r\nrelationship between the north European populations and the Hindus,\r\nbecause of their possession in common of Aryan speech.\r\n\r\nThe name “Aryan race” must also be frankly discarded as a term of racial\r\nsignificance. It is to-day purely linguistic, although there was at one\r\ntime, of course, an identity between the original Proto-Aryan mother\r\ntongue and the race that first spoke and developed it. In short, there\r\nis not nor has there ever been either a Caucasian or an Indo-European\r\nrace, but there was once, thousands of years ago, an original Aryan race\r\nlong since vanished into dim memories of the past. If used in a racial\r\nsense other than as above, it should be limited to the Nordic invaders\r\nof Hindustan now long extinct. The great lapse of time since the\r\ndisappearance of the ancient Aryan race as such is measured by the\r\nextreme disintegration of the various groups of Aryan languages. These\r\nlinguistic divergences are chiefly due to the imposition by conquest of\r\nAryan speech upon several distinct subspecies of man throughout western\r\nAsia and Europe.\r\n\r\nIt may be pertinent before leaving this subject to point out that, as a\r\nwhole, “Germans,” “French,” and “English,” as certain populations are\r\nnow called, are but little more entitled to be considered the direct\r\ndescendants, or even the exclusive modern representatives, of the\r\nancient Germans, Franks or Anglo-Saxons, than are the living Italians or\r\nGreeks to be regarded as the offspring of the Romans of the days of the\r\nRepublic or the Hellenes of the classic period. There are, of course,\r\nmany individuals and groups, perhaps even classes, in each of these\r\nnations, who do accurately represent the race from which the national\r\nname was derived. The Scandinavians, on the other hand, are racially\r\nwhat they were two thousand years ago, though diminished somewhat in\r\nrace vigor by the loss through the emigration of some of their more\r\nenterprising members. Meanwhile, at the other end of Europe, the modern\r\nSpaniard probably more closely represents the Iberians before the\r\narrival of the Gauls than did the Spaniard of five hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n                           RACE AND LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a country is invaded and conquered by a race speaking a foreign\r\nlanguage, one of several things may happen: replacement of both\r\npopulation and language, as in the case of eastern England when\r\nconquered by the Saxons or adoption of the language of the victors by\r\nthe natives, as happened in Roman Gaul, where the invaders imposed their\r\nLatin tongue throughout the land without substantially altering the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe Romans probably modified the race in Gaul by killing a much larger\r\nproportion of the Nordic fighting classes than of the more submissive\r\nAlpines and Mediterraneans. This is confirmed by the fact that when the\r\nprolonged and brilliant resistance to Cæsar’s legions was finally\r\nbroken, no serious attempt was ever again made to throw off the Roman\r\nyoke and a few centuries later the Teutonic invaders encountered no\r\ndetermined opposition from the inhabitants when they entered and\r\noccupied the land.\r\n\r\nIn England and Scotland later conquerors, Norsemen, Danes and Normans,\r\nfailed to change radically the Saxon speech of the country and in Gaul\r\nthe Teutonic tongues of the Franks, Burgundians and Northmen could not\r\ndisplace the language of Rome.\r\n\r\nAutochthonous inhabitants frequently impose upon their invaders their\r\nown language and customs. In Normandy the conquering Norse pirates\r\naccepted the language, religion and customs of the natives and in a\r\ncentury they vanish from history as Scandinavian heathen and appear as\r\nthe foremost representatives of the speech and religion of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn Hindustan the blond Nordic invaders forced their Aryan language on\r\nthe aborigines, but their blood was quickly and utterly absorbed in the\r\ndarker strains of the original owners of the land. A record of the\r\ndesperate efforts of the conqueror classes in India to preserve the\r\npurity of their blood persists until this very day in their carefully\r\nregulated system of castes. In our Southern States Jim Crow cars and\r\nsocial discriminations have exactly the same purpose and justification.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu to-day speaks a very ancient form of Aryan language, but there\r\nremains not one recognizable trace of the blood of the white conquerors\r\nwho poured in through the passes of the Northwest. The boast of the\r\nmodern Indian that he is of the same race as his English ruler is\r\nentirely without basis in fact and the little swarthy native lives amid\r\nthe monuments of a departed grandeur, professing the religion and\r\nspeaking the tongue of his long-forgotten Nordic conquerors, without the\r\nslightest claim to blood kinship. The dim and uncertain traces of Nordic\r\nblood in northern India only serve to emphasize the utter swamping of\r\nthe white man in the burning South.\r\n\r\nThe power of racial resistance of a dense and thoroughly acclimated\r\npopulation to an incoming army is very great. No ethnic conquest can be\r\ncomplete unless the natives are exterminated and the invaders bring\r\ntheir own women with them. If the conquerors are obliged to depend upon\r\nthe women of the vanquished to carry on the race, the intrusive blood\r\nstrain of the invaders in a short time becomes diluted beyond\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that an infiltration of population takes place\r\neither in the guise of unwilling slaves or of willing immigrants, who\r\nfill up waste places and take to the lowly tasks which the lords of the\r\nland despise, thus gradually occupying the country and literally\r\nbreeding out their masters.\r\n\r\nThe former catastrophe happened in the declining days of the Roman\r\nRepublic and the south Italians of to-day are very largely descendants\r\nof the nondescript slaves of all races, chiefly from the southern and\r\neastern coasts of the Mediterranean, who were imported by the Romans\r\nunder the Empire to work their vast estates. The latter is occurring\r\nto-day in many parts of America, especially in New England.\r\n\r\nThe eastern half of Germany has a Slavic Alpine substratum which\r\nrepresents the descendants of the Wends, who first appear about the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era and who by the sixth century had\r\npenetrated as far west as the Elbe, occupying the lands left vacant by\r\nthe Teutonic tribes which had migrated southward. These Wends in turn\r\nwere Teutonized by a return wave of military conquest from the tenth\r\ncentury onward, and to-day their descendants are considered Germans in\r\ngood standing. Having adopted the German as their sole tongue they are\r\nnow in religious, political and cultural sympathy with the pure Teutons;\r\nin fact, they are quite unconscious of any racial distinction.\r\n\r\nThis historic fact underlies the ferocious controversy which has been\r\nraised over the ethnic origin of the Prussians, the issue being whether\r\nthe populations in Brandenburg, Silesia, Posen, West Prussia, and other\r\ndistricts in eastern Germany, are Alpine Wends or true Nordics. The\r\ntruth is that the dominant half of the population is purely Teutonic and\r\nthe remainder of the population are merely Teutonized Wends and Poles of\r\nAlpine affinities. Of course, these territories must also retain some of\r\ntheir early Teutonic population and the blood of the Goth, Burgund,\r\nVandal and Lombard, who at the commencement of the Christian era were\r\nlocated there, as well as of the later Saxon element, must enter largely\r\ninto the composition of the Prussian of to-day.\r\n\r\nSome anthropologists regard the Teutonized round heads of south Germany\r\nas a distinct subdivision of the Alpines because of the large percentage\r\nof blond hair and still larger percentage of light colored eyes.\r\n\r\nThe most important communities in continental Europe of pure German type\r\nare to be found in old Saxony, the country around Hanover, and this\r\nelement prevails generally in the northwestern part of the German Empire\r\namong the Low German-speaking population, while the High German-speaking\r\npopulation is largely composed of Teutonized Alpines.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of the North Sea extending from Schleswig and Holstein into\r\nHolland are inhabited by a very pure Nordic type known as the Frisians.\r\nThey are the handsomest and in many respects the finest of the\r\ncontinental Nordics and are closely related to the English, as many of\r\nthe Post-Roman invaders of England either came from Frisia or from\r\nadjoining districts.\r\n\r\nAll the states involved in the present world war have sent to the front\r\ntheir fighting Nordic element and the loss of life now going on in\r\nEurope will fall much more heavily on the blond giant than on the little\r\nbrunet.\r\n\r\nAs in all wars since Roman times from a breeding point of view the\r\nlittle dark man is the final winner. No one who saw one of our regiments\r\nmarch on its way to the Spanish War could fail to be impressed with the\r\nsize and blondness of the men in the ranks as contrasted with the\r\ncomplacent citizen, who from his safe stand on the gutter curb gave his\r\napplause to the fighting man and then stayed behind to perpetuate his\r\nown brunet type. In the present war one has merely to study the type of\r\nofficer and of the man in the ranks to realize that, in spite of the\r\ndraft net, the Nordic race is contributing an enormous majority of the\r\nfighting men, out of all proportion to their relative numbers in the\r\nnation at large.\r\n\r\nThis same Nordic element, everywhere the type of the sailor, the\r\nsoldier, the adventurer and the pioneer, was ever the type to migrate to\r\nnew countries, until the ease of transportation and the desire to escape\r\nmilitary service in the last forty years reversed the immigrant tide. In\r\nconsequence of this change our immigrants now largely represent lowly\r\nrefugees from “persecution,” and other social discards.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the blood of pioneers has been lost to their race. They\r\ndid not take their women with them. They either died childless or left\r\nhalf-breeds behind them. The virile blood of the Spanish conquistadores,\r\nwho are now little more than a memory in Central and South America, died\r\nout from these causes.\r\n\r\nThis was also true in the early days of our Western frontiersmen, who\r\nindividually were a far finer type than the settlers who followed them.\r\nIn fact, it is said that practically every one of the Forty-Niners in\r\nCalifornia was of Nordic type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                     THE EUROPEAN RACES IN COLONIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor reasons already set forth there are few communities outside of\r\nEurope of pure European blood. The racial destiny of Mexico and of the\r\nislands and coasts of the Spanish Main is clear. The white man is being\r\nrapidly bred out by Negroes on the islands and by Indians on the\r\nmainland. It is quite evident that the West Indies, the coast region of\r\nour Gulf States, perhaps, also the black belt of the lower Mississippi\r\nValley must be abandoned to Negroes. This transformation is already\r\ncomplete in Haiti and is going rapidly forward in Cuba and Jamaica.\r\nMexico and the northern part of South America must also be given over to\r\nnative Indians with an ever thinning veneer of white culture of the\r\n“Latin” type.\r\n\r\nIn Venezuela the pure whites number about one per cent of the whole\r\npopulation, the balance being Indians and various crosses between\r\nIndians, Negroes and whites. In Jamaica the whites number not more than\r\ntwo per cent, while the remainder are Negroes or mulattoes. In Mexico\r\nthe proportion is larger, but the unmixed whites number less than twenty\r\nper cent of the whole, the others being Indians pure or mixed. These\r\nlatter are the “greasers” of the American frontiersman.\r\n\r\nWhenever the incentive to imitate the dominant race is removed the Negro\r\nor, for that matter, the Indian, reverts shortly to his ancestral grade\r\nof culture. In other words, it is the individual and not the race that\r\nis affected by religion, education and example. Negroes have\r\ndemonstrated throughout recorded time that they are a stationary species\r\nand that they do not possess the potentiality of progress or initiative\r\nfrom within. Progress from self-impulse must not be confounded with\r\nmimicry or with progress imposed from without by social pressure or by\r\nthe slaver’s lash.\r\n\r\nWhen the impulse of an inferior race to imitate or mimic the dress,\r\nmanners or morals of the dominant race is destroyed by the acquisition\r\nof political or social independence, the servient race tends to revert\r\nto its original status as in Haiti.\r\n\r\nWhere two distinct species are located side by side history and biology\r\nteach that but one of two things can happen; either one race drives the\r\nother out, as the Americans exterminated the Indians and as the Negroes\r\nare now replacing the whites in various parts of the South; or else they\r\namalgamate and form a population of race bastards in which the lower\r\ntype ultimately preponderates. This is a disagreeable alternative with\r\nwhich to confront sentimentalists but nature is only concerned with\r\nresults and neither makes nor takes excuses. The chief failing of the\r\nday with some of our well meaning philanthropists is their absolute\r\nrefusal to face inevitable facts, if such facts appear cruel.\r\n\r\nIn the Argentine white blood of the various European races is pouring in\r\nso rapidly that a community preponderantly white, but of the\r\nMediterranean race, may develop, but the type is suspiciously swarthy.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, Negro blood together with that of the native inhabitants is\r\nrapidly overwhelming the white Europeans, although in the southern\r\nprovinces German immigration has played an important rôle and the influx\r\nof Italians has also been considerable.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, with the sole exception of the Russian settlements in Siberia,\r\nthere can be and will be no ethnic conquest and all the white men in\r\nIndia, the East Indies, the Philippines and China will leave not the\r\nslightest trace behind them in the blood of the native population. After\r\nseveral centuries of contact and settlement the pure Spanish in the\r\nPhilippines are about half of one per cent. The Dutch in their East\r\nIndian islands are even less, while the resident whites in Hindustan\r\namount to about one-tenth of one per cent. Such numbers are\r\ninfinitesimal and of no force in a democracy, but in a monarchy, if kept\r\nfree from contamination, they suffice for a ruling caste or a military\r\naristocracy. Throughout history it is only the race of the leaders that\r\nhas counted and the most vigorous have been in control and will remain\r\nin mastery in one form or another until such time as democracy and its\r\nillegitimate offspring, socialism, definitely establish cacocracy and\r\nthe rule of the worst and put an end to progress. The salvation of\r\nhumanity will then lie in the chance survival of some sane barbarians\r\nwho may retain the basic truth that inequality and not equality is the\r\nlaw of nature.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, where the natives have been virtually\r\nexterminated by the whites, are developing into communities of pure\r\nNordic blood and will for that reason play a large part in the future\r\nhistory of the Pacific. The bitter opposition of the Australians and\r\nCalifornians to the admission of Chinese coolies and Japanese farmers is\r\ndue primarily to a blind but absolutely justified determination to keep\r\nthose lands as white man’s countries.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, south of the Sahara, the density of the native population\r\nwill prevent the establishment of any purely white communities, except\r\nat the southern extremity of the continent and possibly on portions of\r\nthe plateaux of eastern Africa. The stoppage of famines and wars and the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, while dictated by the noblest impulses of\r\nhumanity, are suicidal to the white man. Upon the removal of these\r\nnatural checks Negroes multiply so rapidly that there will not be\r\nstanding room on the continent for white men, unless, perchance, the\r\nlethal sleeping sickness, which attacks the natives far more frequently\r\nthan the whites, should run its course unchecked.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa a community of mixed Dutch and English extraction is\r\ndeveloping. Here the only difference is one of language. English, being\r\na world tongue, will inevitably prevail over the Dutch patois called\r\n“Taal.” This Frisian dialect, as a matter of fact, is closer to old\r\nSaxon or rather Kentish than any living continental tongue and the blood\r\nof the North Hollander is extremely close to that of the Anglo-Saxon of\r\nEngland. The English and the Dutch will merge in a common type just as\r\nthey have in the past two hundred years in the Colony and State of New\r\nYork. They must stand together if they are to maintain any part of\r\nAfrica as a white man’s country, because they are confronted with the\r\nmenace of an enormous black Bantu population which will drive out the\r\nwhites unless the problem is bravely faced.\r\n\r\nThe only possible solution is to establish large colonies for the\r\nNegroes and to allow them outside of them only as laborers and not as\r\nsettlers. There must be ultimately a black South Africa and a white\r\nSouth Africa side by side or else a pure black Africa from the Cape to\r\nthe cataracts of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIn upper Canada, as in the United States up to the time of our Civil\r\nWar, the white population was purely Nordic. The Dominion is, as a\r\nwhole, handicapped by the presence of an indigestible mass of French\r\nCanadians, largely from Brittany and of Alpine origin, although the\r\nhabitant patois is an archaic Norman of the time of Louis XIV. These\r\nFrenchmen were granted freedom of language and religion by their\r\nconquerors and are now using those privileges to form separatist groups\r\nin antagonism to the English population. The Quebec Frenchmen will\r\nsucceed in seriously impeding the progress of Canada and will succeed\r\neven better in keeping themselves a poor and ignorant community of\r\nlittle more importance to the world at large than are the Negroes in the\r\nSouth. The selfishness of the Quebec Frenchmen is measured by the fact\r\nthat in the present war they will not fight for the British Empire or\r\nfor France or even for clerical Belgium and they are now endeavoring to\r\nmake use of the military crisis to secure a further extension of their\r\n“nationalistic ideals.”\r\n\r\nPersonally the writer believes that the finest and purest type of a\r\nNordic community outside of Europe will develop in northwest Canada and\r\non the Pacific coast of the United States. Most of the other countries\r\nin which the Nordic race is now settling lie outside the special\r\nenvironment in which alone it can flourish.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes of the United States while stationary, were not a serious\r\ndrag on civilization until in the last century they were given the\r\nrights of citizenship and were incorporated in the body politic. These\r\nNegroes brought with them no language or religion or customs of their\r\nown which persisted but adopted all these elements of environment from\r\nthe dominant race, taking the names of their masters just as to-day the\r\nGerman and Polish Jews are assuming American names. They came for the\r\nmost part from the coasts of the Bight of Benin, but some of the later\r\nones came from the southeast coast of Africa by way of Zanzibar. They\r\nwere of various black tribes but have been from the beginning saturated\r\nwith white blood.\r\n\r\nLooking at any group of Negroes in America, especially in the North, it\r\nis easy to see that while they are all essentially Negroes, whether\r\ncoal-black, brown or yellow, a great many of them have varying amounts\r\nof Nordic blood in them, which has in some respects modified their\r\nphysical structure without transforming them in any way into white men.\r\nThis miscegenation was, of course, a frightful disgrace to the dominant\r\nrace but its effect on the Nordics has been negligible, for the simple\r\nreason that it was confined to white men crossing with Negro women and\r\ndid not involve the reverse process, which would, of course, have\r\nresulted in the infusion of Negro blood into the American stock.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America must be regarded racially as a European\r\ncolony and owing to current ignorance of the physical bases of race, one\r\noften hears the statement made that native Americans of Colonial\r\nancestry are of mixed ethnic origin.\r\n\r\nThis is not true.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Revolutionary War the settlers in the thirteen\r\nColonies were overwhelmingly Nordic, a very large majority being\r\nAnglo-Saxon in the most limited meaning of that term. The New England\r\nsettlers in particular came from those counties of England where the\r\nblood was almost purely Saxon, Anglian, Norse and Dane. The date of\r\ntheir migration was earlier than the resurgence of the Mediterranean\r\ntype that has so greatly expanded in England during the last century\r\nwith the growth of manufacturing towns.\r\n\r\nNew England during Colonial times and long afterward was far more Nordic\r\nthan old England; that is, it contained a smaller percentage of small,\r\nPre-Nordic brunets. Any one familiar with the native New Englander knows\r\nthe clean cut face, the high stature and the prevalence of gray and blue\r\neyes and light brown hair and recognizes that the brunet element is less\r\nnoticeable there than in the South.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States were populated also by Englishmen of the purest\r\nNordic type but there is to-day, except among the mountains, an\r\nappreciably larger amount of brunet types than in the North. Virginia is\r\nin the same latitude as North Africa and south of this line no blonds\r\nhave ever been able to survive in full vigor, chiefly because the\r\nactinic rays of the sun are the same regardless of other climatic\r\nconditions. These rays beat heavily on the Nordic race and disturb their\r\nnervous system, wherever the white man ventures too far from the cold\r\nand foggy North.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Colonial elements, the Holland Dutch and the Palatine\r\nGermans, who came over in small numbers to New York and Pennsylvania,\r\nwere also largely Nordic, while many of the French Huguenots who escaped\r\nto America were drawn from the same racial element in France. The\r\nScotch-Irish, who were numerous on the frontier of the middle Colonies\r\nwere, of course, of pure Scotch and English blood, although they had\r\nresided in Ireland for two or three generations. They were quite free\r\nfrom admixture with the earlier Irish, from whom they were cut off\r\nsocially by bitter religious antagonism and they are not to be\r\nconsidered as “Irish” in any sense.\r\n\r\nThere was no important immigration of other elements until the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century when Irish Catholic and German immigrants appear\r\nfor the first time upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic blood was kept pure in the Colonies because at that time\r\namong Protestant peoples there was a strong race feeling, as a result of\r\nwhich half-breeds between the white man and any native type were\r\nregarded as natives and not as white men.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of mixture with the Negroes as the light color of many\r\nNegroes abundantly testifies, but these mulattoes, quadroons or\r\noctoroons were then and are now universally regarded as Negroes.\r\n\r\nThere was also abundant cross breeding along the frontiers between the\r\nwhite frontiersman and the Indian squaw but the half-breed was\r\neverywhere regarded as a member of the inferior race.\r\n\r\nIn the Catholic colonies, however, of New France and New Spain, if the\r\nhalf-breed were a good Catholic he was regarded as a Frenchman or a\r\nSpaniard, as the case might be. This fact alone gives the clew to many\r\nof our Colonial wars where the Indians, other than the Iroquois, were\r\npersuaded to join the French against the Americans by half-breeds who\r\nconsidered themselves Frenchmen. The Church of Rome has everywhere used\r\nits influence to break down racial distinctions. It disregards origins\r\nand only requires obedience to the mandates of the universal church. In\r\nthat lies the secret of the opposition of Rome to all national\r\nmovements. It maintains the imperial as contrasted with the\r\nnationalistic ideal and in that respect its inheritance is direct from\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nRace consciousness in the Colonies and in the United States, down to and\r\nincluding the Mexican War, seems to have been very strongly developed\r\namong native Americans and it still remains in full vigor to-day in the\r\nSouth, where the presence of a large Negro population forces this\r\nquestion upon the daily attention of the whites.\r\n\r\nIn New England, however, whether through the decline of Calvinism or the\r\ngrowth of altruism, there appeared early in the last century a wave of\r\nsentimentalism, which at that time took up the cause of the Negro and in\r\nso doing apparently destroyed, to a large extent, pride and\r\nconsciousness of race in the North. The agitation over slavery was\r\ninimical to the Nordic race, because it thrust aside all national\r\nopposition to the intrusion of hordes of immigrants of inferior racial\r\nvalue and prevented the fixing of a definite American type.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was fought almost entirely by unalloyed native Americans.\r\nThe Irish immigrants were, at the middle of the last century, confined\r\nto a few States and, being chiefly domestic servants or day laborers,\r\nwere of no social importance. They gathered in the large cities and by\r\nvoting as a solid block for their own collective benefit quickly\r\ndemoralized the governments of the municipalities in which they secured\r\nascendancy. The German immigrants who came to America about the same\r\ntime were chiefly enthusiasts who had taken part in the German\r\nRevolution of ’48. In spite of the handicap of a strange language they\r\nformed a more docile and educated element than the Irish and were more\r\nprone to scatter into the rural districts. Neither the Irish nor the\r\nGermans played an important part in the development or policies of the\r\nnation as a whole, although in the Civil War they each contributed a\r\nrelatively large number of soldiers to the Northern army. These Irish\r\nand German elements were for the most part of the Nordic race and while\r\nthey did not in the least strengthen the nation either morally or\r\nintellectually they did not impair its physique.\r\n\r\nThere has been little or no Indian blood taken into the veins of the\r\nnative American, except in States like Oklahoma and in some isolated\r\nfamilies scattered here and there in the Northwest. This particular\r\nmixture will play no very important role in future combinations of race\r\non this continent, except in the north of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe native American has always found and finds now in the black men\r\nwilling followers who ask only to obey and to further the ideals and\r\nwishes of the master race, without trying to inject into the body\r\npolitic their own views, whether racial, religious or social. Negroes\r\nare never socialists or labor unionists and as long as the dominant\r\nimposes its will on the servient race and as long as they remain in the\r\nsame relation to the whites as in the past, the Negroes will be a\r\nvaluable element in the community but once raised to social equality\r\ntheir influence will be destructive to themselves and to the whites. If\r\nthe purity of the two races is to be maintained they cannot continue to\r\nlive side by side and this is a problem from which there can be no\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe native American by the middle of the nineteenth century was rapidly\r\nacquiring distinct characteristics. Derived from the Saxon and Danish\r\nparts of the British Isles and being almost purely Nordic he was by\r\nreason of a differential selection due to a new environment beginning to\r\nshow physical peculiarities of his own slightly variant from those of\r\nhis English forefathers and corresponding rather with the idealistic\r\nElizabethan than with the materialistic Hanoverian Englishman. The Civil\r\nWar, however, put a severe, perhaps fatal, check to the development and\r\nexpansion of this splendid type by destroying great numbers of the best\r\nbreeding stock on both sides and by breaking up the home ties of many\r\nmore. If the war had not occurred these same men with their descendants\r\nwould have populated the Western States instead of the racial\r\nnondescripts who are now flocking there.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the native stock would have\r\ncontinued to maintain a high rate of increase if there had been no\r\nimmigration of foreign laborers in the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nand that the actual population of the United States would be fully as\r\nlarge as it is now but would have been almost exclusively native\r\nAmerican and Nordic.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity that followed the war attracted hordes of newcomers who\r\nwere welcomed by the native Americans to operate factories, build\r\nrailroads and fill up the waste spaces—“developing the country” it was\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThese new immigrants were no longer exclusively members of the Nordic\r\nrace as were the earlier ones who came of their own impulse to improve\r\ntheir social conditions. The transportation lines advertised America as\r\na land flowing with milk and honey and the European governments took the\r\nopportunity to unload upon careless, wealthy and hospitable America the\r\nsweepings of their jails and asylums. The result was that the new\r\nimmigration, while it still included many strong elements from the north\r\nof Europe, contained a large and increasing number of the weak, the\r\nbroken and the mentally crippled of all races drawn from the lowest\r\nstratum of the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans, together with hordes\r\nof the wretched, submerged populations of the Polish Ghettos. Our jails,\r\ninsane asylums and almshouses are filled with this human flotsam and the\r\nwhole tone of American life, social, moral and political has been\r\nlowered and vulgarized by them.\r\n\r\nWith a pathetic and fatuous belief in the efficacy of American\r\ninstitutions and environment to reverse or obliterate immemorial\r\nhereditary tendencies, these newcomers were welcomed and given a share\r\nin our land and prosperity. The American taxed himself to sanitate and\r\neducate these poor helots and as soon as they could speak English,\r\nencouraged them to enter into the political life, first of\r\nmunicipalities and then of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe native Americans are splendid raw material, but have as yet only an\r\nimperfectly developed national consciousness. They lack the instinct of\r\nself-preservation in a racial sense. Unless such an instinct develops\r\ntheir race will perish, as do all organisms which disregard this primary\r\nlaw of nature. Nature had granted to the Americans of a century ago the\r\ngreatest opportunity in recorded history to produce in the isolation of\r\na continent a powerful and racially homogeneous people and had provided\r\nfor the experiment a pure race of one of the most gifted and vigorous\r\nstocks on earth, a stock free from the diseases, physical and moral,\r\nwhich have again and again sapped the vigor of the older lands. Our\r\ngrandfathers threw away this opportunity in the blissful ignorance of\r\nnational childhood and inexperience.\r\n\r\nThe result of unlimited immigration is showing plainly in the rapid\r\ndecline in the birth rate of native Americans because the poorer classes\r\nof Colonial stock, where they still exist, will not bring children into\r\nthe world to compete in the labor market with the Slovak, the Italian,\r\nthe Syrian and the Jew. The native American is too proud to mix socially\r\nwith them and is gradually withdrawing from the scene, abandoning to\r\nthese aliens the land which he conquered and developed. The man of the\r\nold stock is being crowded out of many country districts by these\r\nforeigners just as he is to-day being literally driven off the streets\r\nof New York City by the swarms of Polish Jews. These immigrants adopt\r\nthe language of the native American, they wear his clothes, they steal\r\nhis name and they are beginning to take his women, but they seldom adopt\r\nhis religion or understand his ideals and while he is being elbowed out\r\nof his own home the American looks calmly abroad and urges on others the\r\nsuicidal ethics which are exterminating his own race.\r\n\r\nWhen the test of actual battle comes, it will, of course, be the native\r\nAmerican who will do the fighting and suffer the losses. With him will\r\nstand the immigrants of Nordic blood, but there will be numbers of these\r\nforeigners in the large cities who will prove to be physically unfit for\r\nmilitary duty.\r\n\r\nAs to what the future mixture will be it is evident that in large\r\nsections of the country the native American will entirely disappear. He\r\nwill not intermarry with inferior races and he cannot compete in the\r\nsweat shop and in the street trench with the newcomers. Large cities\r\nfrom the days of Rome, Alexandria, and Byzantium have always been\r\ngathering points of diverse races, but New York is becoming a _cloaca\r\ngentium_ which will produce many amazing racial hybrids and some ethnic\r\nhorrors that will be beyond the powers of future anthropologists to\r\nunravel.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: in any such mixture, the surviving traits will be\r\ndetermined by competition between the lowest and most primitive elements\r\nand the specialized traits of Nordic man; his stature, his light colored\r\neyes, his fair skin and light colored hair, his straight nose and his\r\nsplendid fighting and moral qualities, will have little part in the\r\nresultant mixture.\r\n\r\nThe “survival of the fittest” means the survival of the type best\r\nadapted to existing conditions of environment, which to-day are the\r\ntenement and factory, as in Colonial times they were the clearing of\r\nforests, fighting Indians, farming the fields and sailing the Seven\r\nSeas. From the point of view of race it were better described as the\r\n“survival of the unfit.”\r\n\r\nThis review of the colonies of Europe would be discouraging were it not\r\nfor the fact that thus far little attention has been paid to the\r\nsuitability of a new country for the particular colonists who migrate\r\nthere. The process of sending out colonists is as old as mankind itself\r\nand probably in the last analysis most of the chief races of the world,\r\ncertainly most of the inhabitants of Europe, represent the descendants\r\nof successful colonists.\r\n\r\nSuccess in colonization depends on the selection of new lands and\r\nclimatic conditions in harmony with the immemorial requirements of the\r\nincoming race. The adjustment of each race to its own peculiar habitat\r\nis based on thousands of years of rigid selection which cannot be safely\r\nignored. A certain isolation and freedom from competition with other\r\nraces, for some centuries at least, is also important, so that the\r\ncolonists may become habituated to their new surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have not been on the continent long enough to acquire this\r\nadjustment and consequently do not present as effective a resistance to\r\ncompetition with immigrants as did, let us say, the Italians when\r\noverrun by northern barbarians. As soon as a group of men migrate to new\r\nsurroundings, climatic, social or industrial, a new form of selection\r\narises and those not fitted to the new conditions die off at a greater\r\nrate than in their original home. This form of differential selection\r\nplays a large part in modern industrial centres and in large cities,\r\nwhere unsanitary conditions bear more heavily on the children of Nordics\r\nthan on those of Alpines or Mediterraneans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _PART II_\r\n                       EUROPEAN RACES IN HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n                              EOLITHIC MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore considering the living populations of Europe we must give\r\nconsideration to the extinct peoples that preceded them.\r\n\r\nThe science of anthropology is very recent—in its present form less than\r\nfifty years old—but it has already revolutionized our knowledge of the\r\npast and extended prehistory so that it is now measured not by thousands\r\nbut by tens of thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe history of man prior to the period of metals has been divided into\r\nten or more subdivisions, many of them longer than the time covered by\r\nwritten records. Man has struggled up through the ages, to revert again\r\nand again into savagery and barbarism but apparently retaining each time\r\nsomething gained by the travail of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nSo long as there is in the world a freely breeding stock or race that\r\nhas in it an inherent capacity for development and growth, mankind will\r\ncontinue to ascend until, possibly through the selection and regulation\r\nof breeding as intelligently applied as in the case of domestic animals,\r\nit will control its own destiny and attain moral heights as yet\r\nunimagined.\r\n\r\nThe impulse upward, however, is supplied by a very small number of\r\nnations and by a very small proportion of the population in such\r\nnations. The section of any community that produces leaders or genius of\r\nany sort is only a minute percentage. To utilize and adapt to human\r\nneeds the forces and the raw materials of nature, to invent new\r\nprocesses, to establish new principles, and to elucidate and unravel the\r\nlaws that control the universe call for genius. To imitate or to adopt\r\nwhat others have invented is not genius but mimicry.\r\n\r\nThis something which we call “genius” is not a matter of family, but of\r\nstock or strain, and is inherited in precisely the same manner as are\r\nthe purely physical characters. It may be latent through several\r\ngenerations of obscurity and then flare up when the opportunity comes.\r\nOf this we have many examples in America. This is what education or\r\nopportunity does for a community; it permits in these rare cases fair\r\nplay for development, but it is race, always race, that produces genius.\r\nAn individual of inferior type or race may profit greatly by good\r\nenvironment. On the other hand, a member of a superior race in bad\r\nsurroundings may, and very often does, sink to an extremely low level.\r\nWhile emphasizing the importance of race, it must not be forgotten that\r\nenvironment, while it does not alter the potential capacity of the\r\nstock, can perform miracles in the development of the individual.\r\n\r\nThis genius producing type is slow breeding and there is real danger of\r\nits loss to mankind. Some idea of the value of these small strains can\r\nbe gained from the recent statistics which demonstrate that\r\nMassachusetts produces more than fifty times as much genius per hundred\r\nthousand whites as does Georgia, Alabama or Mississippi, although\r\napparently the race, religion and environment, other than climatic\r\nconditions, are much the same, except for the numbing presence in the\r\nSouth of a large stationary Negro population.\r\n\r\nThe more thorough the study of European prehistory becomes, the more we\r\nrealize how many advances of culture have been made and then lost. Our\r\nparents were accustomed to regard the overthrow of ancient civilization\r\nin the Dark Ages as the greatest catastrophe of mankind, but we now know\r\nthat the classic period of Greece was preceded by similar dark ages\r\ncaused by the Dorian invasions, that had overthrown the Homeric-Mycenæan\r\nculture, which in its turn had flourished after the destruction of its\r\nparent, the brilliant Minoan culture of Crete. Still earlier, some\r\ntwelve thousand years ago, the Azilian Period of poverty and\r\nretrogression succeeded the wonderful achievements of the hunter-artists\r\nof the Upper Paleolithic.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization becomes evident only when immense periods\r\nare studied and compared, but the lesson is always the same, namely,\r\nthat race is everything. Without race there can be nothing except the\r\nslave wearing his master’s clothes, stealing his master’s proud name,\r\nadopting his master’s tongue and living in the crumbling ruins of his\r\nmaster’s palace. Everywhere on the sites of ancient civilizations the\r\nTurk, the Kurd and the Bedouin camp; and Americans may well pause and\r\nconsider the fate of this country which they, and they alone, founded\r\nand nourished with their blood. The immigrant ditch diggers and the\r\nrailroad navvies were to our fathers what their slaves were to the\r\nRomans and the same transfer of political power from master to servant\r\nis taking place to-day.\r\n\r\nMan’s place of origin was undoubtedly Asia. Europe is only a peninsula\r\nof the Eurasiatic continent and although the extent of its land area\r\nduring the Pleistocene was much greater than at present, it is certain\r\nfrom the distribution of the various species of man, that the main races\r\nevolved in Asia, probably north of the great Himalayan range long before\r\nthe centre of that continent was reduced to a series of deserts by\r\nprogressive desiccation.\r\n\r\nThe evidence based on man’s relatively large bulk, on the lack of the\r\ndevelopment of his fore limbs and particularly on his highly specialized\r\nfoot structure all indicate that he has not been arboreal for a vast\r\nperiod of time, probably not since the end of the Miocene. The change of\r\nhabitat from the trees to the ground may have been caused by a profound\r\nmodification of climate, from moist to dry or from warm to cold, which\r\nin turn may have affected the food supply and compelled a more\r\ncarnivorous diet.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the location of the early evolution of man in Asia and in\r\nthe geologically recent submerged area toward the southeast is afforded\r\nby the fossil deposits in the Siwalik hills of northern India; where the\r\nremains of primates have been found which were either ancestral or\r\nclosely related to the four genera of living anthropoids and where we\r\nmay confidently look for remains of the earliest human forms; and by the\r\ndiscovery in Java, which in Pliocene times was connected with the\r\nmainland over what is now the South China Sea, of the earliest known\r\nform of erect primate, the _Pithecanthropus_. This ape-like man is\r\npractically the “missing link,” being intermediate between man and the\r\nanthropoids and is generally believed to have been contemporary with the\r\nGünz glaciation of some 500,000 years ago, the first of the four great\r\nglacial advances in Europe.\r\n\r\nOne or two species of anthropoid apes have been discovered in the\r\nMiocene of Europe which may possibly have been remotely related to the\r\nancestors of man but when the archæological exploration of Asia shall be\r\nas complete and intensive as that of Europe it is probable that more\r\nforms of fossil anthropoids and new species of man will be found there.\r\n\r\nMan existed in Europe during the second and third interglacial periods,\r\nif not earlier. We have his artifacts in the form of eoliths, at least\r\nas early as the second interglacial stage, the Mindel-Riss, of some\r\n300,000 years ago. A single jaw found near Heidelberg is referred to\r\nthis period and is the earliest skeletal evidence of man in Europe. From\r\ncertain remarkable characters in this jaw, it has been assigned to a new\r\nspecies, _Homo heidelbergensis_.\r\n\r\nThen follows a long period showing only scanty industrial relics and no\r\nknown skeletal remains. Man was slowly and painfully struggling up from\r\na culture phase where chance flints served his temporary purpose. This\r\nperiod, known as the Eolithic, was succeeded by a stage of human\r\ndevelopment where slight chipping and retouching of flints for his\r\nincreasing needs led, after vast intervals of time, to the deliberate\r\nmanufacture of tools. This Eolithic Period is necessarily extremely hazy\r\nand uncertain. Whether or not certain chipped or broken flints, called\r\neoliths or dawn stones, were actually human artifacts or were the\r\nproducts of natural forces is, however, immaterial for man must have\r\npassed through such an eolithic stage.\r\n\r\nThe further back we go toward the commencement of this Eolithic culture,\r\nthe more unrecognizable the flints necessarily become until they finally\r\ncannot be distinguished from natural stone fragments. At the beginning,\r\nthe earliest man merely picked up a convenient stone, used it once and\r\nflung it away, precisely as an anthropoid ape would act to-day if he\r\nwanted to break the shell of a tortoise or crack an ostrich egg.\r\n\r\nMan must have experienced the following phases of development in the\r\ntransition from the prehuman to the human stage: first, the utilization\r\nof chance stones and sticks; second, the casual adaptation of flints by\r\na minimum amount of chipping; third, the deliberate manufacture of the\r\nsimplest implements from flint nodules; and fourth, the invention of new\r\nforms of weapons and tools in ever increasing variety.\r\n\r\nOf the last two stages we have an extensive and clear record. Of the\r\nsecond stage we have in the eoliths intermediate forms ranging from\r\nflints that are evidently results of natural causes to flints that are\r\nclearly artifacts. The first and earliest stage, of course, could leave\r\nbehind it no definite record and must in the present state of our\r\nknowledge rest on hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                            PALEOLITHIC MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the deliberate manufacture of implements from flint nodules, we\r\nenter the beginning of Paleolithic time and from here on our way is\r\nrelatively clear. The successive stages of the Paleolithic were of great\r\nlength but are each characterized by some improvement in the manufacture\r\nof tools. During long ages man was merely a tool making and tool using\r\nanimal and, after all is said, that is about as good a definition as we\r\ncan find to-day for the primate we call human.\r\n\r\nThe Paleolithic Period or Old Stone Age lasted from the somewhat\r\nindefinite termination of the Eolithic, some 150,000 years ago, to the\r\nNeolithic or New Stone Age, which began about 7000 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe Paleolithic falls naturally into three great subdivisions. The Lower\r\nPaleolithic includes the whole of the last interglacial stage with the\r\nsubdivisions of the Pre-Chellean, Chellean and Acheulean; the Middle\r\nPaleolithic covers the whole of the last glaciation and is co-extensive\r\nwith the Mousterian Period and the dominance of the Neanderthal species\r\nof man.[1] The Upper Paleolithic embraces all the postglacial stages\r\ndown to the Neolithic and includes the subdivisions of the Aurignacian,\r\nSolutrean, Magdalenian and Azilian. During the entire Upper Paleolithic,\r\nexcept the short closing phase, the Cro-Magnon race flourished.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The Middle Paleolithic Period is suggested here for the first\r\n  time.—EDITOR’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nIt is not until after the third severe period of great cold, known as\r\nthe Riss glaciation, nor until we enter, some 150,000 years ago, the\r\nthird and last interglacial stage of temperate climate, known as the\r\nRiss-Würm, that we find a definite and ascending series of culture. The\r\nPre-Chellean, Chellean and Acheulean divisions of the Lower Paleolithic\r\noccupied the whole of this warm or rather temperate interglacial phase,\r\nwhich lasted nearly 100,000 years.\r\n\r\nA shattered skull, a jaw and some teeth have been discovered recently in\r\nSussex, England. These remains were attributed to the same individual,\r\nwho was named the Piltdown Man. Owing to the extraordinary thickness of\r\nthe skull and the simian character of the jaw, a new genus,\r\n_Eoanthropus_, the “dawn man,” was created and assigned to Pre-Chellean\r\ntimes. Some of the tentative restorations of the fragmentary bones make\r\nthis skull altogether too modern and too capacious for a Pre-Chellean or\r\neven a Chellean.\r\n\r\nFurther study and comparison with the jaws of other primates also\r\nindicate that the jaw belonged to a chimpanzee so that the genus\r\n_Eoanthropus_ must now be abandoned and the Piltdown Man must be\r\nincluded in the genus _Homo_ as at present constituted.\r\n\r\nIn any event the Piltdown Man is highly aberrant and, so far as our\r\npresent knowledge goes, does not appear to be related to any other\r\nspecies of man found during the Lower Paleolithic. Future discoveries of\r\nthe Piltdown type and for that matter of Heidelberg Man may, however,\r\nraise either or both of them to generic rank.\r\n\r\nIn later Acheulean times a new human species, very likely descended from\r\nthe early Heidelberg Man of Eolithic times, appears on the scene and is\r\nknown as the Neanderthal race. Many fossil remains of this type have\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\nThe Neanderthaloids occupied the European stage exclusively, with the\r\npossible exception of the Piltdown Man, from the first appearance of man\r\nin Europe to the end of the Middle Paleolithic. The Neanderthals\r\nflourished throughout the entire duration of the last glacial advance\r\nknown as the Würm glaciation. This period, known as the Mousterian,\r\nbegan about 50,000 years ago and lasted some 25,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe Neanderthal species disappears suddenly and completely with the\r\nadvent of postglacial times, when, about 25,000 years ago, it was\r\napparently supplanted or exterminated by a new and far higher race, the\r\nfamous Cro-Magnons.\r\n\r\nThere may well have been during Mousterian times races of man in Europe\r\nother than the Neanderthaloids, but of them we have no record. Among the\r\nnumerous remains of Neanderthals, however, we do find traces of distinct\r\ntypes showing that this race in Europe was undergoing evolution and was\r\ndeveloping marked variations in characters.\r\n\r\nNeanderthal Man was an almost purely meat eating hunter, living in caves\r\nor rather in their entrances. He was dolichocephalic and not unlike\r\nexisting Australoids, although not necessarily of black skin and was, of\r\ncourse, in no sense a Negro.\r\n\r\nThe skull was characterized by heavy superorbital ridges, a low and\r\nreceding forehead, protruding and chinless under jaw and the posture was\r\nimperfectly erect. This race was widely spread and rather numerous. Some\r\nof its blood may have trickled down to the present time and occasionally\r\none sees a skull apparently of the Neanderthal type. The best skull of\r\nthis type ever seen by the writer belonged to a very intellectual\r\nprofessor in London, who was quite unconscious of his value as a museum\r\nspecimen. In the old black breed of Scotland the overhanging brows and\r\ndeep-set eyes are suggestive of this race.\r\n\r\nAlong with other ancient and primitive racial remnants, ferocious\r\ngorilla-like living specimens of Paleolithic man are found not\r\ninfrequently on the west coast of Ireland and are easily recognized by\r\nthe great upper lip, bridgeless nose, beetling brow with low growing\r\nhair and wild and savage aspect. The proportions of the skull which give\r\nrise to this large upper lip, the low forehead and the superorbital\r\nridges are certainly Neanderthal characters. The other traits of this\r\nIrish type are common to many primitive races. This is the Irishman of\r\ncaricature and the type was very frequent in America when the first\r\nIrish immigrants came in 1846 and the following years. It seems,\r\nhowever, to have almost disappeared in this country. If, as it is\r\nclaimed, the Neanderthals have left no trace of their blood in living\r\npopulations, these Firbolgs are derived from some very ancient and\r\nprimitive race as yet undescribed.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Paleolithic, which began after the close of the fourth and\r\nlast glaciation, about 25,000 years ago, the Neanderthal race was\r\nsucceeded by men of very modern aspect, known as Cro-Magnons. The date\r\nof the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic is the first we can fix with\r\naccuracy and its correctness can be relied on within narrow limits. The\r\nCro-Magnon race first appears in the Aurignacian subdivision of the\r\nUpper Paleolithic. Like the Neanderthals, they were dolichocephalic but\r\nwith a cranial capacity superior to the average in existing European\r\npopulations and a stature of very remarkable size.\r\n\r\nIt is quite astonishing to find that the predominant race in Europe\r\n25,000 years ago, or more, was not only much taller, but had an absolute\r\ncranial capacity in excess of the average of the present population. The\r\nlow cranial average of existing populations in Europe can be best\r\nexplained by the presence of large numbers of individuals of inferior\r\nmentality. These defectives have been carefully preserved by modern\r\ncharity, whereas in the savage state of society the backward members\r\nwere allowed to perish and the race was carried on by the vigorous and\r\nnot by the weaklings.\r\n\r\nThe high brain capacity of the Cro-Magnons is paralleled by that of the\r\nancient Greeks, who in a single century gave to the world out of their\r\nsmall population much more genius than all the other races of mankind\r\nhave since succeeded in producing in a similar length of time. Attica\r\nbetween 530 and 430 B. C. had an average population of about 90,000\r\nfreemen, and yet from this number were born no less than fourteen\r\ngeniuses of the very highest rank. This would indicate a general\r\nintellectual status as much above that of the Anglo-Saxons as the latter\r\nare above the Negroes. The existence at these early dates of a very high\r\ncranial capacity and its later decline shows that there is no upward\r\ntendency inherent in mankind of sufficient strength to overcome\r\nobstacles placed in its way by stupid social customs.\r\n\r\nAll historians are familiar with the phenomenon of a rise and decline in\r\ncivilization such as has occurred time and again in the history of the\r\nworld but we have here in the disappearance of the Cro-Magnon race the\r\nearliest example of the replacement of a very superior race by an\r\ninferior one. There is great danger of a similar replacement of a higher\r\nby a lower type here in America unless the native American uses his\r\nsuperior intelligence to protect himself and his children from\r\ncompetition with intrusive peoples drained from the lowest races of\r\neastern Europe and western Asia.\r\n\r\nWhile the skull of the Cro-Magnon was long, the cheek bones were very\r\nbroad and this combination of broad face with long skull constitutes a\r\npeculiar disharmonic type which occurs to-day only among the very highly\r\nspecialized Esquimaux and one or two other unimportant groups.\r\n\r\nSkulls of this particular type, however, are found in small numbers\r\namong existing populations in central France, precisely in the district\r\nwhere the fossil remains of this race were first discovered. These\r\nisolated Frenchmen probably represent the last lingering remnant of this\r\nsplendid race of hunting savages.\r\n\r\nThe Cro-Magnon culture is found around the basin of the Mediterranean,\r\nand this fact, together with the conspicuous absence in eastern Europe\r\nof its earliest phases, the lower Aurignacian, indicates that it entered\r\nEurope by way of north Africa, as its successors, the Mediterranean\r\nrace, probably did in Neolithic times. There is little doubt that the\r\nCro-Magnons originally developed in Asia and were in their highest stage\r\nof physical development at the time of their first appearance in Europe.\r\nWhatever change took place in their stature during their residence there\r\nseems to have been in the nature of a decline rather than of a further\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing whatever of the Negroid in the Cro-Magnons and they are\r\nnot in any way related to the Neanderthals, who represent a distinct\r\nand, save for the suggestions made above, an extinct species of man.\r\n\r\nThe Cro-Magnon race persisted through the entire Upper Paleolithic,\r\nduring the periods known as the Aurignacian, Solutrean and Magdalenian,\r\nfrom 25,000 to 10,000 B. C. While it is possible that the blood of this\r\nrace enters somewhat into the composition of the peoples of western\r\nEurope, its influence cannot be great and the Cro-Magnons—the Nordics of\r\ntheir day—disappear from view with the advent of the warmer climate of\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that, following the fading ice edge north and\r\neastward through Asia into North America, they became the ancestors of\r\nthe Esquimaux but certain anatomical objections are fatal to this\r\ninteresting theory. No one, however, who is familiar with the culture of\r\nthe Esquimaux and especially with their wonderful skill in bone and\r\nivory carving, can fail to be struck with the similarity of their\r\ntechnique to that of the Cro-Magnons.\r\n\r\nTo the Cro-Magnon race the world owes the birth of art. Caverns and\r\nshelters are constantly unearthed in France and Spain, where the walls\r\nand ceilings are covered with polychrome paintings or with incised\r\nbas-reliefs of animals of the chase. A few clay models, sometimes of the\r\nhuman form, are also found, together with abundant remains of their\r\nchipped but unpolished stone weapons and tools. Certain facts stand out\r\nclearly, namely, that they were purely hunters and clothed themselves in\r\nfurs and skins. They knew nothing of agriculture or of domestic animals,\r\neven the dog being probably as yet untamed and the horse regarded merely\r\nas an object of chase.\r\n\r\nThe question of their knowledge of the principle of the bow and arrow\r\nduring the Aurignacian and Solutrean is an open one but there are\r\ndefinite indications of the use of the arrow, or at least the barbed\r\ndart, in early Magdalenian times and this weapon was well known in the\r\nsucceeding Azilian Period.\r\n\r\nThe presence toward the end of this last period of quantities of very\r\nsmall flints called microliths has given rise to much controversy. It is\r\npossible that some of these microliths represent the tips of small\r\npoisoned arrows such as are now in very general use among primitive\r\nhunting tribes the world over. Certain grooves in some of the flint\r\nweapons of the Upper Paleolithic may also have been used for the\r\nreception of poison. It is highly probable that the immediate\r\npredecessors of the Azilians, the Cro-Magnons, perhaps the greatest\r\nhunters that ever lived, not only used poisoned darts but were adepts in\r\ntrapping game by means of pitfalls and snares, precisely as do some of\r\nthe hunting tribes of Africa to-day. Barbed arrowheads of flint or bone,\r\nsuch as were commonly used by the North American Indians, have not been\r\nfound in Paleolithic deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the Solutrean Period the Cro-Magnons shared Europe with a new race\r\nknown as the Brünn-Předmost, found in central Europe. This race is\r\ncharacterized by a long face as well as a long skull, and was,\r\ntherefore, harmonic. This Brünn-Předmost race appears to have been well\r\nsettled in the Danubian and Hungarian plains and this location indicates\r\nan eastern rather than a southern origin.\r\n\r\nGood anatomists have seen in this race the last lingering traces of the\r\nNeanderthaloids but it is more probable that we have here the first\r\nadvance wave of the primitive forerunners of one of the modern European\r\ndolichocephalic races.\r\n\r\nThis new race was not artistic, but had great skill in fashioning\r\nweapons and possibly is associated with the peculiarities of Solutrean\r\nculture and the decline of art which characterizes that period. The\r\nartistic impulse of the Cro-Magnons which flourished so vigorously\r\nduring the Aurignacian seems to be quite suspended during this Solutrean\r\nPeriod, but reappears in the succeeding Magdalenian times. This\r\nMagdalenian art is clearly the direct descendant of Aurignacian models\r\nand in this closing age of the Cro-Magnons all forms of Paleolithic art,\r\ncarving, engraving, painting and the manufacture of weapons, reach their\r\nhighest and final culmination.\r\n\r\nNine or ten thousand years may be assigned to the Aurignacian and\r\nSolutrean Periods and we may with considerable certainty give the\r\nminimum date of 16,000 B. C. as the beginning of Magdalenian time. Its\r\nentire duration can be safely set down at 6,000 years, thus bringing the\r\nfinal termination of the Magdalenian to 10,000 B. C. All these dates are\r\nextremely conservative and the error, if any, is in assigning too late\r\nand not too early a period to the end of Magdalenian times.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Magdalenian we enter upon the last period of\r\nPaleolithic times, the Azilian, which lasted from about 10,000 to 7,000\r\nB. C., when the Upper Paleolithic, the age of chipped flints, definitely\r\nand finally ends in Europe. This period takes its name from the Mas\r\nd’Azil, or “House of Refuge,” a huge cavern in the eastern Pyrenees\r\nwhere the local Protestants took shelter during the persecutions. The\r\nextensive deposits in this cave are typical of the Azilian epoch and\r\nhere certain marked pebbles may be the earliest known traces of symbolic\r\nwriting, but true writing was probably not developed until the late\r\nNeolithic.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of this Azilian Period art entirely disappears and the\r\nsplendid physical type of the Cro-Magnons is succeeded by what appear to\r\nhave been degraded savages, who had lost the force and vigor necessary\r\nfor the strenuous chase of large game and had turned to the easier life\r\nof fishermen.\r\n\r\nIn the Azilian the bow and arrow are in common use in Spain and it is\r\nwell within the possibilities that the introduction and development of\r\nthis new weapon from the South may have played its part in the\r\ndestruction of the Cro-Magnons; otherwise it is hard to account for the\r\ndisappearance of this race of large stature and great brain power.\r\n\r\nThe Azilian, also called the Tardenoisian in the north of France, was\r\nevidently a period of racial disturbance and at its close the beginnings\r\nof the existing races are found.\r\n\r\nFrom the first appearance of man in Europe and for many tens of\r\nthousands of years down to some ten or twelve thousand years ago all\r\nknown human remains are of dolichocephalic type.\r\n\r\nIn the Azilian Period appears the first round skull race. It comes\r\nclearly from the East. Later we shall find that this invasion of the\r\nforerunners of the existing Alpine race came from southwestern Asia by\r\nway of the Iranian plateau, Asia Minor, the Balkans and the valley of\r\nthe Danube, and spread over nearly all of Europe. The earlier round\r\nskull invasions may as well have been infiltrations as armed conquests\r\nsince apparently from that day to this the round skulls have occupied\r\nthe poorer mountain districts and have seldom ventured down to the rich\r\nand fertile plains.\r\n\r\nThis new brachycephalic race is known as the Furfooz or Grenelle race,\r\nso called from the localities in Belgium and France where it was first\r\ndiscovered. Members of this round skull race have also been found at\r\nOfnet in Bavaria where they occur in association with a dolichocephalic\r\nrace, our first historic evidence of the mixture of contrasted races.\r\nThe descendants of this Furfooz-Grenelle race and of the succeeding\r\nwaves of invaders of the same brachycephalic type now occupy central\r\nEurope as Alpines and form the predominant peasant type in central and\r\neastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn this same Azilian Period there appear, coming this time from the\r\nSouth, the first forerunners of the Mediterranean race. The descendants\r\nof this earliest wave of Mediterraneans and their later reinforcements\r\noccupy all the coast and islands of the Mediterranean and are spread\r\nwidely over western Europe. They can everywhere be identified by their\r\nshort stature, slight build, long skull and brunet hair and eyes.\r\n\r\nWhile during this Azilian-Tardenoisian Period these ancestors of two of\r\nthe existing European races are appearing in central and southern\r\nEurope, a new culture phase, also distinctly Pre-Neolithic, was\r\ndeveloping along the shores of the Baltic. It is known as Maglemose from\r\nits type locality in Denmark. It is believed to be the work of the first\r\nwave of the Nordic race which had followed the retreating glaciers\r\nnorthward over the old land connections between Denmark and Sweden to\r\noccupy the Scandinavian Peninsula. In the remains of this culture we\r\nfind definite evidence of the domesticated dog.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of the Mediterranean race the Azilian-Tardenoisian\r\ndraws to its close and with it the entire Paleolithic Period. It is safe\r\nto assign for the end of the Paleolithic and the beginning of the\r\nNeolithic or Polished Stone Age, the date of 7,000 or 8,000 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe races of the Paleolithic Period, so far as we can judge from their\r\nremains, appear successively on the scene with all their characters\r\nfully developed. The evolution of all these subspecies and races took\r\nplace somewhere in Asia or eastern Europe. None of these races appear to\r\nbe ancestral one to another, although the scanty remains of the\r\nHeidelberg Man would indicate that he may have given rise to the later\r\nNeanderthals. Other than this possible affinity, the various races of\r\nPaleolithic times are not related one to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n                     THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 7,000 B.C. we enter an entirely new period in the history of man,\r\nthe Neolithic or New Stone Age, when the flint implements were polished\r\nand not merely chipped. Early as is this date in European culture, we\r\nare not far from the beginnings of an elaborate civilization in parts of\r\nAsia and Egypt. The earliest organized governments, so far as our\r\npresent knowledge goes, were Egypt and Sumer. Chinese civilization at\r\nthe other end of Asia is later, but mystery still shrouds its origin and\r\nits connection, if any, with the Mesopotamian city-states. The solution\r\nprobably lies in the central region of the Syr Darya and future\r\nexcavations in those regions may uncover very early cultures. Balkh, the\r\nancient Bactra, the mother of cities, is located where the trade routes\r\nbetween China, India and Mesopotamia converged and it is in this\r\nneighborhood that careful and thorough excavations will probably find\r\ntheir greatest reward.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are not dealing with Asia but with Europe only and our\r\nknowledge is confined to the fact that the various cultural advances at\r\nthe end of the Paleolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic correspond\r\nwith the arrival of new races.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic was formerly\r\nconsidered as revolutionary, an abrupt change of both race and culture,\r\nbut a period more or less transitory, known as the Campignian, now\r\nappears to bridge over this gap. This is only what should be expected,\r\nsince in human archæology as in geology the more detailed our knowledge\r\nbecomes the more gradually we find one period or horizon merges into its\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the opening of the Neolithic the old-fashioned\r\nchipped weapons and implements remain the predominant type and the\r\npolished flints so characteristic of the Neolithic appear at first only\r\nsporadically, then increase in number until finally they entirely\r\nreplace the rougher designs of the preceding Old Stone Age.\r\n\r\nSo in their turn these Neolithic polished stone implements, which\r\nultimately became both varied and effective as weapons and tools,\r\ncontinued in use long after metallurgy developed. In the Bronze Period\r\nmetal armor and weapons were for ages of the greatest value. So they\r\nwere necessarily in the possession of the military and ruling classes\r\nonly, while the unfortunate serf or common soldier who followed his\r\nmaster to war did the best he could with leather shield and stone\r\nweapons. In the ring that clustered around Harold for the last stand on\r\nSenlac Hill many of the English thanes died with their Saxon king, armed\r\nsolely with the stone battle-axes of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nIn Italy also there was a long period known to the Italian archæologists\r\nas the Eneolithic Period when good flint tools existed side by side with\r\nvery poor copper and bronze implements; so that, while the Neolithic\r\nlasted in western Europe four or five thousand years, it is, at its\r\ncommencement, without clear definition from the preceding Paleolithic\r\nand at its end it merges gradually into the succeeding ages of metals.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening Campignian phase there followed a long period typical\r\nof the Neolithic, known as the Robenhausian or Age of the Swiss Lake\r\nDwellers, which reached its height after 5000 B. C. The lake dwellings\r\nseem to have been the work chiefly of the round skull Alpine races and\r\nare found in numbers throughout the region of the Alps and their\r\nfoothills and along the valley of the Danube.\r\n\r\nThese Robenhausian pile built villages were the earliest known form of\r\nfixed habitation in Europe and the culture found in association with\r\nthem was a great advance over that of the preceding Paleolithic. This\r\ntype of permanent habitation flourished through the entire Upper\r\nNeolithic and the succeeding Bronze Age. Pile villages end in\r\nSwitzerland with the first appearance of iron but elsewhere, as on the\r\nupper Danube, they still existed in the days of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nPottery is found together with domesticated animals and agriculture,\r\nwhich appear during the Robenhausian for the first time. The chase,\r\nsupplemented by trapping and fishing, was still common but it probably\r\nwas more for clothing than for food. A permanent site is not alone the\r\nbasis of an agricultural community, but it also involves at least a\r\npartial abandonment of the chase, because only nomads can follow the\r\ngame in its seasonal migrations and hunted animals soon leave the\r\nneighborhood of settlements.\r\n\r\nThe Terramara Period of northern Italy was a later phase of culture\r\ncontemporaneous with the Upper Robenhausian and was typical of the\r\nBronze Age. During the Terramara Period fortified and moated stations in\r\nswamps or close to the banks of rivers became the favorite resorts\r\ninstead of pile villages built in lakes. The first traces of copper are\r\nfound during this period. The earliest human remains in the Terramara\r\ndeposits are long skulled, but round skulls soon appear in association\r\nwith bronze implements. This indicates an original population of\r\nMediterranean affinities overwhelmed later by Alpines.\r\n\r\n                 CLASSIFICATION OF THE RACES OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n                   THEIR CHARACTERS AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬──────────────────┐\r\n │     EUROPEAN RACES     │  MODERN PEOPLES   │ ANCIENT PEOPLES  │\r\n │                        │                   │                  │\r\n │                        │                   │                  │\r\n ├────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────┤\r\n │_Nordic._               │                   │                  │\r\n │Homo sapiens nordicus,  │All Norse, Swedes, │Sacæ, Massagetæ,  │\r\n │  Homo sapiens europeus,│  Danes, Letts,    │  Scythians,      │\r\n │  Baltic, Indo-Germanic,│  many Finlanders, │  Cimmerians,     │\r\n │  Indo-European,        │  many Russians and│  Persians,       │\r\n │  Scandinavian,         │  Poles, North     │  Phrygians,      │\r\n │  Teutonic, Germanic,   │  Germans, many    │  Achæans,        │\r\n │  Dolicho-lepto,        │  French, Dutch,   │  Dorians,        │\r\n │  Reihengraber, Finnic. │  Flemings,        │  Thracians,      │\r\n │                        │  English, Scotch, │  Umbrians,       │\r\n │                        │  most Irish,      │  Oscans, Gauls,  │\r\n │                        │  Native Americans,│  Galatians,      │\r\n │                        │  Canadians,       │  Cymry, Belgæ,   │\r\n │                        │  Australians,     │  many Romans,    │\r\n │                        │  Africanders.     │  Goths, Lombards,│\r\n │                        │                   │  Vandals,        │\r\n │                        │                   │  Burgunds,       │\r\n │                        │                   │  Franks, Danes,  │\r\n │                        │                   │  Saxons, Angles, │\r\n │                        │                   │  Norse, Normans, │\r\n │                        │                   │  Varangians.     │\r\n │                        │                   │  Reihengräber.   │\r\n │                        │                   │  Kurgans.        │\r\n │                        │                   │  Maglemose       │\r\n │                        │                   │  culture.        │\r\n │                        │                   │                  │\r\n │_Alpine._               │                   │                  │\r\n │Homo sapiens alpinus    │Bretons, Walloons, │Sumerians,        │\r\n │  (Eurasiatic),         │  Central French,  │  Hittites, Medes,│\r\n │  Celto-Slav or Kelts of│  some Basques,    │  Khosars,        │\r\n │  the French, Sarmatian,│  Savoyards, Swiss,│  Sarmatians,     │\r\n │  Arvernian, Auvergnat, │  Tyrolese, most   │  Wends, Sorbs.   │\r\n │  Slavic, Savoyard,     │  South Germans,   │  Furfooz-Grenelle│\r\n │  Lappanoid, Armenoid.  │  North Italians,  │  race, Swiss Lake│\r\n │                        │  German-Austrians,│  Dwellers, Gizeh │\r\n │                        │  Bohemians,       │  skulls.         │\r\n │                        │  Slovaks, Magyars,│  Robenhausen.    │\r\n │                        │  many Poles, most │  Round Barrows.  │\r\n │                        │  Russians, Serbs, │  Bronze culture. │\r\n │                        │  Bulgars, most    │                  │\r\n │                        │  Rumanians, most  │                  │\r\n │                        │  Greeks, Turks,   │                  │\r\n │                        │  Armenians, most  │                  │\r\n │                        │  Persians and     │                  │\r\n │                        │  Afghans.         │                  │\r\n │                        │                   │                  │\r\n │_Mediterranean._        │                   │                  │\r\n │Homo sapiens            │Many English,      │Egyptians, many   │\r\n │  mediterraneus         │  Portuguese,      │  Babylonians,    │\r\n │  (Eurafrican), Iberian,│  Spaniards, some  │  Pelasgians,     │\r\n │  Ligurian,             │  Basques,         │  Etruscans,      │\r\n │  Atlanto-Mediterranean.│  Provençals, South│  Ligurians,      │\r\n │                        │  Italians,        │  Phœnicians, most│\r\n │                        │  Sicilians, many  │  Greeks, many    │\r\n │                        │  Greeks and       │  Romans, Cretans,│\r\n │                        │  Rumanians, Moors,│  Iberians.

The coasts of the Baltic\r\nwere apparently occupied for the first time at the very beginning of\r\nthis period, as no trace of Paleolithic industry has been found there,\r\nother than the Maglemose, which represents only the very latest phase of\r\nthe Old Stone Age. The kitchen middens, or refuse heaps, of Sweden and\r\nmore particularly of Denmark date from the early Neolithic and thus are\r\nsomewhat earlier than the lake dwellers. Rough pottery occurs in them\r\nfor the first time, but no traces of agriculture have been found and, as\r\nsaid, the dog seems to have been the only domesticated animal.\r\n\r\nFrom these two centres, the Alps and the North, an elaborate and\r\nvariegated Neolithic culture spread through western Europe and an\r\nautochthonous development took place, comparatively little influenced by\r\ntrade intercourse with Asia after the first immigrations of the new\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nWe may assume that the distribution of races in Europe during the\r\nNeolithic was roughly as follows.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean basin and western Europe, including Spain, Italy,\r\nGaul, Britain and parts of western Germany, were populated by\r\nMediterranean long heads. In Britain the Paleolithic population must\r\nhave been very small and the Neolithic Mediterraneans were the first\r\neffectively to open up the country. Even they kept to the open moorlands\r\nand avoided the heavily wooded and swampy valleys which to-day are the\r\nmain centres of population. Before metal and especially iron tools were\r\nin use forests were an almost complete barrier to the expansion of an\r\nagricultural population.\r\n\r\nThe Alps and the territories immediately adjacent, with Central Gaul and\r\nmuch of the Balkans, were inhabited by Alpine types. These Alpines\r\nextended northward until they came in touch in eastern Germany and\r\nPoland with the southernmost Nordics, but as the Carpathians at a much\r\nlater date, namely, from the fourth to the eighth century A. D., were\r\nthe centre of radiation of the Alpine Slavs, it is very possible that\r\nduring the Neolithic the early Nordics lay farther north and east.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Alpines and occupying the shores of the Baltic and\r\nScandinavia, together with eastern Germany, Poland and Russia, were\r\nlocated the Nordics. At the very base of the Neolithic and perhaps still\r\nearlier, this race occupied Scandinavia, and Sweden became the nursery\r\nof what has been generally called the Teutonic subdivision of the Nordic\r\nrace. It was in that country that the peculiar characters of stature and\r\nblondness became most accentuated and it is there that we find them\r\nto-day in their greatest purity.\r\n\r\nDuring the Neolithic the remnants of early Paleolithic man must have\r\nbeen numerous, but later they were either exterminated or absorbed by\r\nthe existing European races.\r\n\r\nDuring all this Neolithic Period Mesopotamia and Egypt were thousands of\r\nyears in advance of Europe, but only a small amount of culture from\r\nthese sources seems to have trickled westward up the valley of the\r\nDanube, then and long afterward the main route of intercourse between\r\nwestern Asia and the heart of Europe. Some trade also passed from the\r\nBlack Sea up the Russian rivers to the Baltic coasts. Along these latter\r\nroutes there came from the north to the Mediterranean world the amber of\r\nthe Baltic, a fossil resin greatly prized by early man for its magic\r\nelectrical qualities.\r\n\r\nGold was probably the first metal to attract the attention of primitive\r\nman, but could only be used for purposes of ornamentation. Copper, which\r\nis often found in a pure state, was also one of the earliest metals\r\nknown and probably came first either from the mines of Cyprus or of the\r\nSinai Peninsula. These latter mines are known to have been worked before\r\n3400 B. C. by systematic mining operations and much earlier “the metal\r\nmust have been obtained by primitive methods from surface ore.” It is,\r\ntherefore, probable that copper was known and used, at first for\r\nornament and later for implements, in Egypt before 4000 B. C. and\r\npossibly even earlier in the Mesopotamian regions.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the confines of recorded history and the first absolutely\r\nfixed date, 4241 B. C., is established for lower Egypt by the oldest\r\nknown calendar. The earliest date as yet for Mesopotamia is somewhat\r\nlater, but these two countries supply the basis of the chronology of the\r\nancient world until a few centuries before Christ.\r\n\r\nWith the use of copper the Neolithic fades to its end and the Bronze Age\r\ncommences soon thereafter. This next step in advance was made apparently\r\nbefore 3000 B. C. when some unknown genius discovered that an amalgam of\r\nnine parts of copper to one part of tin would produce the metal we now\r\ncall bronze, which has a texture and hardness suitable for weapons and\r\ntools. The discovery revolutionized the world. The new knowledge was a\r\nlong time spreading and weapons of this material were of fabulous value,\r\nespecially in countries where there were no native mines and where\r\nspears and swords could only be obtained through trade or conquest. The\r\nesteem in which these bronze weapons, and still more the later weapons\r\nof iron, were held, is indicated by the innumerable legends and myths\r\nconcerning magic swords and armor, the possession of which made the\r\nowner well-nigh invulnerable and invincible.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of obtaining tin for this amalgam led to the early voyages\r\nof the Phœnicians, who from the cities of Tyre and Sidon and their\r\ndaughter Carthage traversed the entire length of the Mediterranean,\r\nfounded colonies in Spain to work the Spanish tin mines, passed the\r\nPillars of Hercules and finally voyaged through the stormy Atlantic to\r\nthe Cassiterides, the Tin Isles of Ultima Thule. There, on the coasts of\r\nCornwall, they traded with the native British of kindred Mediterranean\r\nrace for the precious tin. These dangerous and costly voyages become\r\nexplicable only if the value of this metal for the composition of bronze\r\nbe taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nAfter these bronze weapons were elaborated in Egypt the knowledge of\r\ntheir manufacture and use was extended through conquest into Palestine,\r\nand northward into Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the possession of these new weapons on the Alpine\r\npopulations of western Asia was magical and resulted in an intensive and\r\nfinal expansion of round skulls into Europe. This invasion came through\r\nAsia Minor, the Balkans and the valley of the Danube, poured into Italy\r\nfrom the north, introduced bronze among the earlier Alpine lake dwellers\r\nof Switzerland and among the Mediterraneans of the Terramara stations of\r\nthe valley of the Po and at a later date reached as far west as Britain\r\nand as far north as Holland and Norway, where its traces are still to be\r\nfound among the living population.\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous appearance of bronze about 3000 or 2800 B. C. in the\r\nsouth as well as in the north of Italy may possibly be attributed to a\r\nlateral wave of this same invasion which, passing through Egypt, where\r\nit left behind the so-called Gizeh round skulls, reached Tunis and\r\nSicily. In southern Italy bronze may have been introduced from Crete.\r\nWith the first knowledge of metals begins the Eneolithic Period of the\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nThe close resemblance in design and technique among the implements of\r\nthe Bronze Age in widely separated localities is so great that we can\r\ninfer a relatively simultaneous introduction.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of bronze the custom of incineration of the dead\r\nalso appears and replaces the typical Neolithic custom of inhumation.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of bronze into England and into Scandinavia may be\r\nsafely dated about one thousand years later, after 1800 B. C. The fact\r\nthat the Alpines only barely reached Ireland indicates that at this time\r\nthat island was severed from England and that the land connection\r\nbetween England and France had been broken. The computation of the\r\nforegoing dates, of course, is somewhat hypothetical, but the fixed fact\r\nremains that this last expansion of the Alpines brought the knowledge of\r\nbronze to western and northern Europe and to the Mediterranean and\r\nNordic peoples living there.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the introduction of bronze in the areas occupied chiefly\r\nby the Mediterranean race along the Atlantic coast and in Britain, as\r\nwell as in north Africa from Tunis to Morocco, is seen in the\r\nconstruction and in the wide distribution of the megalithic funeral\r\nmonuments, which appear to have been erected, not by Alpines but by the\r\ndolichocephs. The occurrence of bronze tools and weapons in the\r\ninterments shows clearly that the megaliths of the south of France date\r\nfrom the beginning of the Bronze Age. The absence of bronze from the\r\ndolmens of Brittany may indicate an earlier age. It is, however, more\r\nlikely that the opening Bronze Age in the South was contemporary with\r\nthe late Neolithic in the North. The construction and use of these\r\nmonuments continued at least until the very earliest trace of iron\r\nappears and in fact mound burials among the Vikings were common until\r\nthe introduction of Christianity.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is evidence of very early use of iron in Egypt the\r\nknowledge of this metal as well as of bronze in Europe centres around\r\nthe area occupied by the Alpines in the eastern Alps and its earliest\r\nphase is known as the Hallstatt culture, from a little town in the Tyrol\r\nwhere it was first discovered. This Hallstatt iron culture appeared\r\nabout 1500 B. C. The Alpine Hittites in northeast Asia Minor were\r\nprobably the first to mine and smelt iron and they introduced it to the\r\nAlpines of eastern Europe, but it was the Nordics who benefited by its\r\nuse. Bronze weapons and the later iron ones proved in the hands of these\r\nNorthern barbarians to be of terrible effectiveness. With these metal\r\nswords in their grasp, the Nordics conquered the Alpines of central\r\nEurope and then suddenly entered the ancient world as raiders and\r\ndestroyers of cities. The classic civilizations of the northern coasts\r\nof the Mediterranean Sea fell, one after another, before the “Furor\r\nNormanorum,” just as two thousand years later the provinces of Rome were\r\ndevastated by the last great flood of the Nordics from beyond the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe first Nordics to appear in European history are tribes speaking\r\nAryan tongues in the form of the various Celtic and related dialects in\r\nthe West, of Umbrian in Italy and of Thracian in the Balkans. These\r\nbarbarians, pouring down from the North, swept with them large numbers\r\nof Alpines whom they had already thoroughly Nordicized. The process of\r\nconquering and assimilating the Alpines must have gone on for long\r\ncenturies before our first historic records and the work was so\r\nthoroughly done that the very existence of this Alpine race as a\r\nseparate subspecies of man was actually forgotten for many centuries by\r\nthemselves and by the world at large until it was revealed in our own\r\nday by the science of skull measurements.\r\n\r\nThe Hallstatt iron culture did not extend into western Europe and the\r\nsmelting and extensive use of this metal in southern Britain and\r\nnorthwestern Europe are of much later date and occur in what is called\r\nthe La Tène Period, usually assigned to the fifth and fourth century B.\r\nC.\r\n\r\nIron weapons were, however, known sporadically in England much earlier,\r\nperhaps as far back as 800 B. C., but were very rare and were probably\r\nimportations from the Continent.\r\n\r\n“Hallstatt relics have only been found in the northeast or centre of\r\nFrance and it appears that the Bronze Age continued in the remainder of\r\nthat country until about 700 B. C.”\r\n\r\nThe spread of this La Tène culture is associated with the Nordic Cymry,\r\nwho constituted the last wave of Celtic-speaking invaders into western\r\nEurope, while the earlier Nordic Gauls and Goidels had arrived in Gaul\r\nand Britain equipped with bronze only.\r\n\r\nIn Roman times, following the La Tène Period, the main races of Europe\r\noccupied the relative positions which they had held during the whole\r\nNeolithic Period and which they hold to-day, with the exception that the\r\nNordic subspecies was less extensively represented in western Europe\r\nthan when, a few hundred years later, the so-called Teutonic tribes\r\noverran these countries; but on the other hand, the Nordics occupied\r\nlarge areas in eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland and Russia now mainly\r\noccupied by the Slavs of Alpine race.\r\n\r\nMany countries in central Europe were in Roman times inhabited by\r\nfair-haired, blue eyed barbarians, where now the population is\r\npreponderantly brunet and becoming yearly more so.\r\n\r\n                         CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE[2]\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │                               METALS                                │\r\n │LATER IRON                                                           │\r\n │  La Tène Culture   Europe                      500 B.

It forms the\r\nwesternmost extension of a widespread subspecies which, outside of\r\nEurope, occupies Asia Minor, Iran, the Pamirs and the Hindu Kush. In\r\nfact the western Himalayas were probably its original centre of\r\nevolution and radiation and among its Asiatic members is a distinct\r\nsubdivision, the Armenoids.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine race is distinguished by a round face and correspondingly\r\nround skull which in the true Armenians has a peculiar sugarloaf shape,\r\na character which can be easily recognized. The Alpines must not be\r\nconfounded with the slit-eyed Mongols who centre around Thibet and the\r\nsteppes of north Asia. The fact that both these races are round skulled\r\ndoes not involve identity of origin any more than the long skulls of the\r\nNordics and of the Mediterraneans require that they be both considered\r\nof the same subspecies, although good anthropologists have been misled\r\nby this parallelism. The Alpines are of stocky build and moderately\r\nshort stature, except sometimes where they have been crossed with Nordic\r\nelements. This race is also characterized by dark hair, except where\r\nthere has been a strong Nordic admixture as in south Germany and\r\nSwitzerland. In Europe at the present time the eye, also, is usually\r\ndark but sometimes grayish. The ancestral Proto-Alpines from the\r\nhighlands of western Asia must, of course, have had brunet eyes and very\r\ndark, probably black, hair. Whether we are justified in considering gray\r\neyes as peculiar to populations of mixed Alpine and Nordic blood is\r\ndifficult to determine, but one thing is certain, the combination of\r\nblue eyes and flaxen hair is never Alpine.\r\n\r\nThe European Alpines retain very little evidence of their Asiatic origin\r\nexcept the skull shape and have been in contact with the Nordic race so\r\nlong that in central and western Europe they are everywhere saturated\r\nwith the blood of that race. Many populations now considered good\r\nGermans, such as the majority of the Würtembergers, Bavarians,\r\nAustrians, Swiss and Tyrolese are merely Nordicized Alpines.\r\n\r\nWhile the Swiss are to-day neither tall nor long-headed, their country\r\nwas thoroughly conquered early in the Christian era by the Nordic\r\nAlemanni who entered from the Rhine Valley. The exodus of soldiers from\r\nthe forest cantons throughout the Middle Ages to fight as mercenaries in\r\nFrance and Italy gradually drained off this Nordic element until the\r\nchief evidence of its former existence lies to-day in the large amount\r\nof blondness among the Swiss. With the loss of this type the nation has\r\nceased to be a military community.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance in Europe of the Alpines dates from the Azilian\r\nPeriod when it is represented by the Furfooz-Grenelle race. There were\r\nlater several invasions of this race which entered Europe from the Asia\r\nMinor plateaux, by way of the Balkans and the valley of the Danube,\r\nduring Neolithic times and, also, at the beginning of the Bronze Age. It\r\nappears also to have passed north of the Black Sea, as some slight\r\ntraces have been discovered there of round skulls which long antedate\r\nthe existing population but the Russian brachycephaly of to-day is of\r\nmuch later origin and is due mainly to the eastward spread of Alpines\r\nfrom the regions of the Carpathians since the first centuries of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nThis race in its final expansion far to the northwest ultimately reached\r\nNorway, Denmark and Holland and planted among the dolichocephalic\r\nnatives small colonies of round skulls, which still exist. These\r\ncolonies are found along the coast and while of small extent are clearly\r\nmarked. On the southwestern seaboard of Norway these round heads are\r\ndark and relatively short.\r\n\r\nWhen this invasion reached the extreme northwest of Europe its energy\r\nwas spent and the invaders were soon forced back into central Europe by\r\nthe Nordics. The Alpines at this time of maximum extension about 1800 B.\r\nC. crossed into Britain and a few reached Ireland and introduced bronze\r\ninto both these islands. As the metal appears about the same time in\r\nSweden it is safe to assume that it was introduced by this invasion.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Round Barrows in England were Alpines, but their numbers\r\nwere so scanty that they have left behind them in the skulls of the\r\nliving population but little demonstrable evidence of their former\r\npresence. If we are ever able accurately to analyze the various strains\r\nthat enter in more or less minute quantities into the blood of the\r\nBritish nation, we shall find many traces of these Round Barrow men as\r\nwell as other interesting and ancient remnants especially in the western\r\nisles and peninsulas.\r\n\r\nIn the study of European populations the great and fundamental fact\r\nabout the British Isles is the almost total absence there to-day of true\r\nAlpine round skulls. It is the only important state in Europe in which\r\nthe round skulls play no part and the only nation of any rank composed\r\nsolely of Nordic and Mediterranean races in approximately equal numbers.\r\nTo this fact are undoubtedly due many of the individualities and much of\r\nthe greatness of the English people.\r\n\r\nThe cephalic index in England is rather low, about 78, but there is a\r\ntype of tall men, with a tendency to roundheadedness allied to a very\r\nmarked intellectual capacity, known as the “Beaker Maker” type. They are\r\nprobably descended from the men of the Round Barrows, who while\r\nbrachycephalic were tall and presumably dark and entered England on the\r\neast and northeast. The Beaker Makers appear at the very end of the\r\nNeolithic and, at least in the case of the last of them to arrive, are\r\nidentified with the Bronze Age.\r\n\r\nBefore this tall, round-headed type reached Britain, they had absorbed\r\nmany Nordic elements and they have nothing except the skull shape in\r\ncommon with the Alpines living closest, those of Belgium and France.\r\nHowever, they do suggest strongly the Dinaric race of the Tyrol and\r\nDalmatian coast of the Adriatic. In addition to the Beaker Makers\r\nremains of short, thick-set brachycephs have also been found in small\r\nnumbers. These last appear to have been true Alpines.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of central Europe by Alpines, which occurred in the\r\nNeolithic, following in the wake of the Azilian forerunners of the same\r\ntype—the Furfooz-Grenelle race—represented a very great advance in\r\nculture. They brought with them from Asia the art of domesticating\r\nanimals and the first knowledge of the cereals and of pottery and were\r\nan agricultural race in sharp contrast to the flesh eating hunters who\r\npreceded them.\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic populations of the lake dwellings in Switzerland and the\r\nextreme north of Italy, which flourished about 5000 B. C., all belonged\r\nto this Alpine race. A comparison of the scanty physical remains of\r\nthese lake dwellers with the inhabitants of the existing villages on the\r\nlake shores demonstrates that the skull shape has changed little or not\r\nat all during the last seven thousand years and affords us another proof\r\nof the persistency of physical characters.\r\n\r\nThis Alpine race in Europe is now so thoroughly acclimated that it is no\r\nlonger Asiatic in any respect and has nothing in common with the Mongols\r\nexcept its round skulls. Such Mongolian elements as exist to-day in\r\nscattered groups throughout eastern Europe are remnants of the later\r\ninvasions of Tatar hordes which, beginning with Attila in the fifth\r\ncentury, ravaged eastern Europe for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nIn western and central Europe the present distribution of the Alpine\r\nrace is a substantial recession from its earlier extent and it has been\r\neverywhere conquered and subordinated by Celtic- and Teutonic-speaking\r\nNordics. Beginning with the first appearance of the Celtic-speaking\r\nNordics in western Europe, the Alpine race has been obliged to give\r\nground but has mingled its blood everywhere with the conquerors and now\r\nafter centuries of obscurity it appears to be increasing again at the\r\nexpense of the master race.\r\n\r\nThe Alpines reached Spain, as they reached Britain, in small numbers and\r\nwith spent force but they still persist along the Cantabrian Alps as\r\nwell as among the French Basques on the northern side of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThe Anaryan Basque or Euskarian language may be a derivative of the\r\noriginal speech of these Alpines, as its affinities point eastward and\r\ntoward Asia rather than southward and toward the littoral of Africa and\r\nthe Hamitic speech of the Mediterranean Berbers. Basque was probably\r\nrelated to the extinct Aquitanian. The Ligurian language, also seemingly\r\nAnaryan, if ever closely deciphered may throw some light on the subject.\r\nThere are dim traces all along the north African coast of a round skull\r\ninvasion about 3000 B. C. through Syria, Egypt, Tripoli and Tunis and\r\nfrom there through Sicily to southern Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine race forms to-day, as in Cæsar’s time, the great bulk of the\r\npopulation of central France with a Nordic aristocracy resting upon it.\r\nThey occupy as the lower classes the uplands of Belgium, where, known as\r\nWalloons, they speak an archaic French dialect closely related to the\r\nancient _langue d’oïl_. They form a majority of the upland population of\r\nAlsace, Lorraine, Baden, Würtemberg, Bavaria, Tyrol, Switzerland and\r\nnorthern Italy; in short, of the entire central _massif_ of Europe. In\r\nBavaria and the Tyrol the Alpines are so thoroughly Nordicized that\r\ntheir true racial affinities are betrayed by their round skulls alone.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach Austria we come in contact with the Slavic-speaking\r\nnations which form a subdivision of the Alpine race appearing relatively\r\nlate in history and radiating from the Carpathian Mountains. In western\r\nand central Europe in relation to the Nordic race the Alpine is\r\neverywhere the ancient, underlying and submerged type. The fertile\r\nlands, river valleys and cities are here in the hands of the Nordics but\r\nin eastern Germany and Poland we find conditions reversed. That is an\r\nold Nordic broodland with a Nordic substratum underlying the bulk of the\r\npeasantry, which now consists of round skulled Alpine Slavs. On top of\r\nthese again we have an aristocratic upper class of comparatively recent\r\nintroduction and of Saxon origin in eastern Germany. In Austria this\r\nupper class is Swabian and Bavarian.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Slavs into eastern Germany is believed to have been\r\nby infiltration and not by conquest. In the fourth century these Wends\r\nwere called Venethi, Antes and Sclaveni, and were described as strong in\r\nnumbers but despised in war. Through the neglect of the Teutons they had\r\nbeen allowed to range far and wide from their homes near the\r\nnortheastern Carpathians and to occupy the lands formerly belonging to\r\nthe Nordic nations, who had abandoned their country and flocked into the\r\nRoman Empire. Goth, Burgund, Lombard and Vandal were replaced by the\r\nlowly Wend and Sorb, whose descendants to-day form the privates in the\r\neast German regiments, while the officers are everywhere recruited from\r\nthe Nordic upper class. The mediæval relation of these Slavic tribes to\r\nthe dominant Teuton is well expressed in the meaning—slave—which has\r\nbeen attached to their name in western languages.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of eastern Germany and Poland by the Slavs probably\r\noccurred from 400 A. D. to 700 A. D. but these Alpine elements were\r\nreinforced from the east and south from time to time during the\r\nsucceeding centuries. Beginning early in the tenth century, the Saxons\r\nunder their Emperors, especially Henry the Fowler, turned their\r\nattention eastward and during the next two centuries they reconquered\r\nand thoroughly Germanized all this section of Europe.\r\n\r\nA similar series of changes in racial predominance took place in Russia\r\nwhere in addition to a nobility largely Nordic a section of the\r\npopulation is of ancient Nordic type, although the bulk of the peasantry\r\nconsists of Alpine Slavs.\r\n\r\nThe Alpines in eastern Europe are represented by various branches of the\r\n“Slavic” nations. Their area of distribution was split into two sections\r\nby the occupation of the great Dacian plain first by the Avars about 600\r\nA. D. and later by the Hungarians about 900 A. D. These Avars and\r\nMagyars came from somewhere in eastern Russia beyond the sphere of Aryan\r\nspeech and their invasions separated the northern Slavs, known as Wends,\r\nCzechs, Slovaks, and Poles, from the southern Slavs, known as Serbs and\r\nCroats. These southern Slavs entered the Balkan Peninsula in the sixth\r\ncentury from the northeast and to-day form the great mass of the\r\npopulation there.\r\n\r\nThe centre of radiation of all these Slavic-speaking Alpines was located\r\nin the Carpathians, especially the Ruthenian districts of Galicia and\r\neastward to the neighborhood of the Pripet swamps and the head-waters of\r\nthe Dnieper in Polesia, where the Slavic dialects are believed to have\r\ndeveloped and whence they spread throughout Russia about the eighth\r\ncentury. These early Slavs were probably the Sarmatians of the Greek and\r\nRoman writers. Their name “Venethi” seems to have been a later\r\ndesignation. The original Proto-Slavic language being Aryan must have\r\nbeen at some distant date imposed by Nordics upon the Alpines, but its\r\ndevelopment into the present Slavic tongues was chiefly the work of\r\nAlpines.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the expansion of the Alpines of the Slavic-speaking\r\ngroup seems to have occurred after the Fourth Century and they have\r\nspread in the East over areas which were originally Nordic, very much as\r\nthe Teutons had previously overrun and submerged the earlier Alpines in\r\nthe West. The Mongol, Tatar and Turk who invaded Europe much later\r\nreinforced the brachycephalic element in these countries. To some extent\r\nthe round skulled Alpines in Russia have been reinforced by way of the\r\nCaucasus and the route north of the Black Sea by their kindred in\r\nwestern Asia. The greater part of the purely Asiatic types has been\r\nthoroughly absorbed and Europeanized except in certain localities in\r\nRussia more especially in the east and south, where Mongoloid tribes\r\nsuch as the Mordvins, Bashkirs and Kalmucks have maintained their type\r\neither in isolated and relatively large groups or side by side with\r\ntheir Slavic neighbors. In both cases the isolation is maintained\r\nthrough religious and social differences.\r\n\r\nThe Avars preceded the Magyars in Hungary, but they have merged with the\r\nlatter without leaving traces that can be identified. Certain Mongoloid\r\ncharacters found in Bulgaria are believed, however, to be of Avar\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe original physical type of the Magyars and the European Turks has now\r\npractically vanished as a result of prolonged intermarriage with the\r\noriginal inhabitants of Hungary and the Balkans. These tribes have left\r\nlittle behind but their language and, in the case of the Turks, their\r\nreligion. The brachycephalic Hungarians to-day resemble the Austrian\r\nGermans much more than they do the Slavic-speaking populations adjoining\r\nthem on the north and south or the Rumanians on the east.\r\n\r\nDriven onward by the Avars, the Bulgars appeared south of the Danube\r\nabout the end of the seventh century, coming originally from eastern\r\nRussia where the remnants of their kindred still persist along the\r\nVolga. To-day they conform physically in the western half of the country\r\nto the Alpine Serbs and in the eastern half to the Mediterranean race,\r\nas do also the Rumanians of the Black Sea coast.\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing remains of the ancestral Bulgars except their name.\r\nLanguage, religion and nearly, but not quite all, of the physical type\r\nhave disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe early members of the Nordic race in order to reach the Mediterranean\r\nworld had to pass through the Alpine populations and must have absorbed\r\na certain amount of Alpine blood. Therefore the Umbrians in Italy and\r\nthe Gauls of western Europe, while predominantly Nordic, were more mixed\r\nespecially in the lower classes with Alpine blood than were the Belgæ or\r\nCymry or their successors, the Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Alemanni,\r\nSaxons, Franks, Lombards, Danes and Northmen, all of whom appear in\r\nhistory as Nordics of the so-called Teutonic group.\r\n\r\nIn some portions of their range notably Savoy and central France the\r\nAlpine race is much less affected by Nordic influence than elsewhere but\r\non the contrary it shows signs of a very ancient admixture with\r\nMediterranean and even earlier elements. Brachycephalic Alpine\r\npopulations in comparative purity still exist in the interior of\r\nBrittany as in Auvergne, although nearly surrounded by Nordic\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nWhile the Alpines were everywhere overwhelmed and driven to the\r\nfastnesses of the mountains, the warlike and restless nature of the\r\nNordics has enabled the more stable Alpine population to reassert itself\r\nslowly, and Europe is probably much less Nordic to-day than it was\r\nfifteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe early Alpines made very large contributions to the civilization of\r\nthe world and were the medium through which many advances in culture\r\nwere introduced from Asia into Europe. This race at the time of its\r\nfirst appearance in the west brought to the nomad hunters a knowledge of\r\nagriculture and of primitive pottery and of domestication of animals and\r\nthus made possible a great increase in population and the establishment\r\nof permanent settlements. Still later its final expansion was the means\r\nthrough which the knowledge of metals reached the Mediterranean and\r\nNordic populations of the west and north. Upon the appearance on the\r\nscene of the Nordics the Alpine race temporarily lost its identity and\r\nsank to the subordinate and obscure position which it still largely\r\noccupies.\r\n\r\nIn western Asia members of this race seemingly are entitled to the honor\r\nof the earliest Mesopotamian civilization of which we have knowledge,\r\nnamely, that of Sumer and its northerly neighbor Accad in Mesopotamia.\r\nIt is also the race of early Elam and Media. In fact, the basis of\r\nMesopotamian civilization belongs to this race. Later Babylonia and\r\nAssyria were Arabic and Semitic while Persia was Nordic and Aryan.\r\n\r\nIn classic, mediæval and modern times the Alpines have played an\r\nunimportant part in European culture and in western Europe they have\r\nbeen so thoroughly Nordicized that they exist rather as an element in\r\nNordic race development than as an independent type. There are, however,\r\nmany indications in current history which point to an impending\r\ndevelopment of civilization in the Slavic branches of this race and the\r\nworld must be prepared to face changes in the Russias which will, for\r\ngood or for evil, bring them more closely into touch with western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n                         THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean subspecies formerly called the Iberian is a relatively\r\nsmall, light boned, long skulled race, of brunet coloring, becoming even\r\nswarthy in certain portions of its range. Throughout Neolithic times and\r\npossibly still earlier it seems to have occupied, as it does to-day, all\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean including the coast of Africa from\r\nMorocco on the west to Egypt on the east. The Mediterraneans are the\r\nwestern members of a subspecies of man which forms a substantial part of\r\nthe population of Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan and Hindustan with\r\nperhaps a southward extension into Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe Aryanized Afghan and Hindu of northern India speak languages derived\r\nfrom Old Sanskrit and are distantly related to the Mediterranean race.\r\nAside from a common dolichocephaly these peoples are entirely distinct\r\nfrom the Dravidians of south India whose speech is agglutinative and who\r\nshow strong evidence of profound mixture with the ancient Negrito\r\nsubstratum of southern Asia.\r\n\r\nEverywhere throughout the Asiatic portion of its range the Mediterranean\r\nrace overlies an even more ancient Negroid race. These Negroids still\r\nhave representatives among the Pre-Dravidians of India, the Veddahs of\r\nCeylon, the Sakai of the Malay Peninsula and the natives of the Andaman\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThis Mediterranean subspecies at the close of the Paleolithic spread\r\nfrom the basin of the Inland Sea northward by way of Spain throughout\r\nwesternmost Europe including the British Isles and, before the final\r\nexpansion of the Alpines, was widely distributed up to and, possibly,\r\ntouching the domain of the Nordic dolichocephs. The Mediterraneans did\r\nnot cross the Alps from the south but spread around the mountains. In\r\nattaining to Britain from Spain by way of Central France it is probable\r\nthat they swept with them Paleolithic remnants from the ancient centre\r\nof population in the Auvergne district.\r\n\r\nIn all this vast range from the British Isles to Hindustan, it is not to\r\nbe supposed that there is absolute identity of race. Certain portions,\r\nhowever, of the populations of the countries throughout this long\r\nstretch do show in their physique clear indications of descent from a\r\nNeolithic race of a common original type, which we may call\r\nProto-Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from inevitable admixture with late Nordic and early\r\nPaleolithic elements, the brunet type of Englishman has had perhaps ten\r\nthousand years of independent evolution during which he has undergone\r\nselection due to the climatic and physical conditions of his northern\r\nhabitat. The result is that he has specialized far away from the\r\nProto-Mediterranean race which contributed his blood originally to\r\nBritain while it was, probably, still part of continental Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of their range in India this race, the Mediterraneans,\r\nhave been crossed with Dravidians and with Pre-Dravidian Negroids. They\r\nhave also had imposed upon them other ethnic elements which came over\r\nthrough the Afghan passes from the northwest. The resultant racial\r\nmixture in India has had its own line of specialization. Residence in\r\nthe fertile but unhealthy river bottoms, the direct rays of a tropic sun\r\nand competition with the immemorial autochthones have unsparingly weeded\r\ngeneration after generation until the existing Hindu has little in\r\ncommon with the ancestral Proto-Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Mediterranean race in the British Isles that the English,\r\nScotch and Americans owe whatever brunet characters they possess. In\r\nwestern Europe, wherever it exists, it appears to underlie the Alpine\r\nrace and, in fact, wherever this race is in contact with either the\r\nAlpines or the Nordics it would seem to represent the more ancient\r\nstratum of the population.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know this Mediterranean type never existed in Scandinavia\r\nand all brunet elements found there can be attributed to introductions\r\nin the Bronze Age or in historic times. Nor did the Mediterranean race\r\never enter or cross the high Alps as did the Nordics at a much later\r\ndate on their way to the Mediterranean basin from the Baltic coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean race with its Asiatic extensions is bordered\r\neverywhere on the north of its enormous range from Spain to India by\r\nround skulls but there does not seem to be as much evidence of mixture\r\nbetween these two subspecies of man as there is between the Alpines and\r\nthe Nordics.\r\n\r\nAlong its southern boundary the Mediterraneans are in contact with\r\neither the long skulled Negroes of Africa or the ancient Negrito\r\npopulation of southern Asia. In Africa this race has drifted southward\r\nover the Sahara and up the Nile Valley and has modified the blood of the\r\nNegroes in both the Senegambian and equatorial regions.\r\n\r\nBeyond these mixtures of blood, there is absolutely no relationship\r\nbetween the Mediterranean race and the Negroes. The fact that the\r\nMediterranean race is long skulled as well as the Negro does not\r\nindicate relationship as has been suggested. An overemphasis of the\r\nimportance of the skull shape as a somatological character can easily\r\nmislead and characters other than skull proportions must be carefully\r\nconsidered in determining race.\r\n\r\nFrom a zoological point of view Africa north of the Sahara is now and\r\nhas been since early Tertiary times a part of Europe. This is true both\r\nof animals and of the races of man. The Berbers of north Africa to-day\r\nare racially identical with the Spaniards and south Italians while the\r\nancient Egyptians and their modern descendants, the fellaheen, are\r\nmerely well-marked varieties of this Mediterranean race.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians fade off toward the west into the so-called Hamitic\r\npeoples (to use an obsolete name) of Libya, and toward the south the\r\ninfusion of Negro blood becomes increasingly great until we finally\r\nreach the pure Negro. On the east in Arabia we find an ancient and\r\nhighly specialized subdivision of the Mediterranean race, which has from\r\ntime out of mind crossed the Red Sea and infused its blood into the\r\nNegroes of east Africa.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Mediterranean race forms in Europe a substantial part of the\r\npopulation of the British Isles, the great bulk of the population of the\r\nIberian Peninsula, nearly one-third of the population of France,\r\nLiguria, Italy south of the Apennines and all the Mediterranean coasts\r\nand islands, in some of which like Sardinia it exists in great purity.\r\nIt forms the substratum of the population of Greece and of the eastern\r\ncoast of the Balkan Peninsula. Everywhere in the interior of the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, except in eastern Bulgaria and parts of Rumania, it has been\r\nreplaced by the South Slavs and by the Albanians, the latter a mixture\r\nof the ancient Illyrians and the Slavs.\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles the Mediterranean race represents the Pre-Nordic\r\npopulation and exists in considerable numbers in Wales and in certain\r\nportions of England, notably in the Fen districts to the northeast of\r\nLondon. In Scotland it is far less marked, but has left its brunetness\r\nas an indication of its former prevalence and this dark hair and eye\r\ncolor is very often associated with tall stature.\r\n\r\nThis is the race that gave the world the great civilizations of Egypt,\r\nof Crete, of Phœnicia including Carthage, of Etruria, of Mycenæan\r\nGreece, of Assyria and much of Babylonia. It gave us, when mixed and\r\ninvigorated with Nordic elements, which probably predominated in the\r\nupper and ruling classes and imposed their guidance upon the masses, the\r\nmost splendid of all civilizations, that of ancient Hellas, and the most\r\nenduring of political organizations, the Roman state.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the Mediterranean race entered into the blood and\r\ncivilization of Rome, it is now difficult to say, but the traditions of\r\nthe Eternal City, its love of organization, of law and military\r\nefficiency, as well as the Roman ideals of family life, of loyalty and\r\ntruth, point clearly to a northern rather than to a Mediterranean\r\norigin, although there must have been some Alpine strains mixed in with\r\nthe Nordic element.\r\n\r\nThe struggles in early Rome between Latin and Etruscan and the endless\r\nquarrels between patrician and plebeian may have arisen from this\r\nexistence in Rome, side by side, of two distinct and clashing races,\r\nprobably Nordic and Mediterranean respectively. The Roman busts that\r\nhave come down to us often show features of a very Anglo-Saxon cast but\r\nwith a somewhat round head. The Romans were short in stature in\r\ncomparison with the nations north of the Alps and in the recently\r\ndiscovered battlefield of the Teutoburgian Forest where Varus and his\r\nlegions perished in the reign of Augustus the skeletons of the Romans,\r\nidentified by their armor, were notably smaller and slighter than were\r\nthose of the German victors. The indications on the whole point to a\r\nNordic aristocracy in Rome with some Alpine elements. The Plebs, on the\r\nother hand, was largely Mediterranean and Oriental and finally in the\r\nlast days of the Republic ceased to contain any purely Roman blood.\r\n\r\nThe northern qualities of Rome are in sharp contrast to the less\r\nEuropean traits of the classic Greeks, whose volatile and analytical\r\nspirit, lack of cohesion, political incapacity and ready resort to\r\ntreason all point clearly to southern and eastern affinities.\r\n\r\nWhile very ancient, located for probably ten thousand years in western\r\nand southern Europe, and even longer on the south shore of the\r\nMediterranean, nevertheless this subspecies cannot be called purely\r\nEuropean. Its occupation of the north coast of Africa and the west coast\r\nof Europe can be traced everywhere by its beautifully polished stone\r\nweapons and tools. The megalithic monuments also, which are found in\r\nassociation with this race, may mark its line of advance in western\r\nEurope, although they extend beyond the range of the Mediterraneans into\r\nthe domain of the Scandinavian Nordics. These huge stone structures were\r\nchiefly sepulchral memorials and are very suggestive of the Egyptian\r\nfuneral monuments. They date back to the first knowledge of the\r\nmanufacture and use of bronze tools by the Mediterranean race. They\r\noccur in great numbers, size and variety along the north coast of Africa\r\nand up the Atlantic seaboard through Spain, Brittany and England to\r\nScandinavia.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the various groups of the Mediterranean race did not\r\nspeak in the first instance any form of Aryan tongue and we know that\r\nthese languages were introduced into the Mediterranean world by invaders\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the language of the Nordic invaders was Celtic and is believed\r\nto have nearly died out by Roman times. Its remnants and the ancient\r\nspeech of the natives were in turn superseded, along with the Phœnician\r\nspoken in some of the southern coast towns, by the Latin of the\r\nconquering Roman. Latin mixed with some small elements of Gothic\r\nconstruction and Arabic vocabulary forms to-day the basis of modern\r\nPortuguese, Castilian and Catalan.\r\n\r\nThe native Mediterranean race of the Iberian Peninsula quickly absorbed\r\nthe blood of these Celtic-speaking Nordic Gauls, just as it later\r\ndiluted beyond recognition the vigorous physical characters of the\r\nNordic Vandals, Suevi and Visigoths. A certain amount of Nordic blood\r\nstill persists to-day in northern Spain, especially in Galicia and along\r\nthe Pyrenees, as well as generally among the upper classes. According to\r\nclassic writers there were light and dark types in Spain in Roman times.\r\nThe Romans left no evidence of their domination except in their language\r\nand religion; while the earlier Phœnicians on the coasts and the later\r\nswarms of Moors and Arabs all over the peninsula, but chiefly in the\r\nsouth, were closely related by race to the native Iberians.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Mediterranean race which inhabits southern France\r\noccupies most of the territory of ancient Languedoc and Provence and it\r\nwas these Provençals who developed and preserved during the Middle Ages\r\nthe romantic civilization of the Albigensians, a survival of classic\r\nculture which was drowned in blood by a crusade from the north in the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn northern Italy only the coast of Liguria is occupied by the\r\nMediterranean race. In the valley of the Po the Mediterraneans\r\npredominated during the early Neolithic but with the introduction of\r\nbronze the Alpines appear and round skulls to this day prevail north of\r\nthe Apennines. About 1100 B. C. the Nordic Umbrians and Oscans swept\r\nover the Alps from the northeast, conquered northern Italy and\r\nintroduced their Aryan speech, which gradually spread southward. The\r\nUmbrian state was afterward overwhelmed by the Tyrrhenians or Etruscans,\r\nwho were of Mediterranean race and who, by 800 B. C. had extended their\r\nempire northward to the Alps and temporarily checked the advance of the\r\nNordics. In the sixth century B. C. new swarms of Nordics, coming this\r\ntime from Gaul and speaking Celtic dialects, seized the valley of the Po\r\nand in 382 B. C. these Gauls, heavily reinforced from the north and\r\nunder the leadership of Brennus, stormed Rome and completely destroyed\r\nthe Etruscan power. From that time onward the valley of the Po became\r\nknown as Cisalpine Gaul. Mixed with other Nordic elements, chiefly\r\nGothic and Lombard, this population persists to this day, and is the\r\nbackbone of modern Italy.\r\n\r\nA continuation of this movement of these Gauls, or Galatians as the\r\nGreek world called them, starting from northern Italy occurred a century\r\nlater when these Nordics suddenly appeared before Delphi in Greece in\r\n279 B. C. and then crossed into Asia Minor and founded the state called\r\nGalatia, which endured until Christian times.\r\n\r\nSouth Italy until its conquest by Rome was Magna Græcia and the\r\npopulation to-day retains many Pelasgian Greek elements. It is among\r\nthese classic remnants that artists search for the handsomest specimens\r\nof the Mediterranean race. In Sicily also the race is purely\r\nMediterranean in spite of the admixture of types coming from the\r\nneighboring coasts of Tunis. These intrusive elements, however, were all\r\nof kindred race. Traces of Alpines in these regions and on the adjoining\r\nAfrican coast are very scarce and wherever found may be referred to the\r\nfinal wave of round skull invasion which introduced bronze into Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Greece the Mediterranean Pelasgians speaking a Non-Aryan tongue were\r\nconquered by the Nordic Achæans, who entered from the northeast\r\naccording to tradition prior to 1250 B. C. probably between 1400 and\r\n1300 B. C. Doubtless there were still earlier waves of these same Nordic\r\ninvaders as far back as 1700 B. C., which was a period of general unrest\r\nand migration throughout the ancient world.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic Achæans and Mediterranean Pelasgians as yet unmixed stand out\r\nin clear contrast in the Homeric account of the ten year siege of Troy,\r\nwhich is generally assigned to the date of 1194 to 1184 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe same invasion that brought the Achæans into Greece brought a related\r\nNordic people to the coast of Asia Minor, known as Phrygians. Of this\r\nrace were the Trojan leaders.\r\n\r\nBoth the Trojans and the Greeks were commanded by huge blond princes,\r\nthe heroes of Homer—in fact, even the Gods were fair-haired—while the\r\nbulk of the armies on both sides was composed of little brunet\r\nPelasgians, imperfectly armed and remorselessly butchered by the leaders\r\non either side. The only common soldiers mentioned by Homer as of the\r\nsame race as the heroes were the Myrmidons of Achilles.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the Achæans and the Pelasgians began to amalgamate,\r\nnew hordes of Nordic barbarians collectively called Hellenes entered\r\nfrom the northern mountains and destroyed this old Homeric-Mycenæan\r\ncivilization. This Dorian invasion took place a little before 1100 B. C.\r\nand brought in the three main Nordic strains of Greece, the Dorian, the\r\nÆolian and the Ionian groups, which remain more or less distinct and\r\nseparate throughout Greek history. Among these Nordics the Dorians may\r\nhave included some Alpine elements. It is more than probable that this\r\ninvasion or swarming of Nordics into Greece was part of the same general\r\nracial upheaval that brought the Umbrians and Oscans into Italy.\r\n\r\nLong years of intense and bitter conflict follow between the old\r\npopulation and the newcomers and when the turmoil of this revolution\r\nsettled down classic Greece appears. What was left of the Achæans\r\nretired to the northern Peloponnesus and the survivors of the early\r\nPelasgian population remained in Messenia serving as helots their\r\nSpartan masters. The Greek colonies in Asia Minor were founded largely\r\nby refugees fleeing from these Dorian invaders.\r\n\r\nThe Pelasgian strain seems to have persisted best in Attica and the\r\nIonian states. The Dorian Spartans appear to have retained more of the\r\ncharacter of the northern barbarians than the Ionian Greeks but the\r\nsplendid civilization of Hellas was due to a fusion of the two elements,\r\nthe Achæan and Hellene of Nordic and the Pelasgian of Mediterranean\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between Dorian Sparta and Ionian Athens, between the\r\nmilitary efficiency, thorough organization and sacrifice of the citizen\r\nfor the welfare of the state, which constituted the basis of\r\nLacedæmonian power, and the Attic brilliancy, instability and extreme\r\ndevelopment of individualism, is strikingly like the contrast between\r\nPrussia with its Spartan-like culture and France with its Athenian\r\nversatility.\r\n\r\nTo this mixture of races in classic Greece the Mediterranean Pelasgians\r\ncontributed their Mycenæan culture and the Nordic Achæans and Hellenes\r\ncontributed their Aryan language, fighting efficiency and the European\r\naspect of Greek life.\r\n\r\nThe first result of a crossing of two such contrasted subspecies as the\r\nNordic and Mediterranean races has repeatedly been a new outburst of\r\ncivilization. This occurs as soon as the older race has imparted to the\r\nconquerors its culture and before the victors have allowed their blood\r\nto be attenuated by mixture. This process seems to have happened several\r\ntimes in Greece.\r\n\r\nLater, in 338 B. C., when the original Nordic blood had been hopelessly\r\ndiluted by mixture with the ancient Mediterranean elements, Hellas fell\r\nan easy prey to Macedon. The troops of Philip and Alexander were Nordic\r\nand represented the uncultured but unmixed ancestral type of the Achæans\r\nand Hellenes. Their unimpaired fighting strength was irresistible as\r\nsoon as it was organized into the Macedonian phalanx, whether directed\r\nagainst their degenerate brother Greeks or against the Persians, whose\r\noriginal Nordic elements had also by this time practically disappeared.\r\nWhen in its turn the pure Macedonian blood was impaired by intermixture\r\nwith Asiatics, they, too, vanished and even the royal Macedonian\r\ndynasties in Asia and Egypt soon ceased to be Nordic or Greek except in\r\nlanguage and customs.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Greek states in which the Nordic\r\nelement most predominated outlived the other states. Athens fell before\r\nSparta and Thebes outlived them both. Macedon in classic times was\r\nconsidered quite the most barbarous state in Hellas and was scarcely\r\nrecognized as forming part of Greece, but it was through the military\r\npower of its armies and the genius of Alexander that the Levant and\r\nwestern Asia became Hellenized. Alexander with his Nordic features,\r\naquiline nose, fair skin, gently curling light hair and mixed eyes, the\r\nleft blue and the right very black, typifies this Nordic conquest of the\r\nNear East.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to-day to find in purity the physical traits of\r\nthe ancient race in the Greek-speaking lands and islands and it is\r\nchiefly among the pure Nordics of Anglo-Norman type that there occur\r\nthose smooth and regular classic features, especially the brow and nose\r\nlines, that were the delight of the sculptors of Hellas.\r\n\r\nTo what extent any of the blood of the ancient Hellenes flows in the\r\nveins of the Greeks of to-day is difficult to determine but it should be\r\nfound, if anywhere, in Crete and in the Ægean Islands. The modern Greek\r\nis trying to purify his language back to classic Ionian and to\r\nappropriate the traditions of the mighty Past, but to do this something\r\nmore is needed than the naming of children after Agamemnon and Hecuba.\r\nEven in Roman times, the ancient Greek of the classic period was little\r\nmore than a tradition and the term Græculus given to the contemporary\r\nHellenes was one of contempt.\r\n\r\nConcerning the physical type of classic in contrast to Homeric Greece,\r\nwe know that the Greeks were predominantly long-headed and of relatively\r\nshort stature in comparison with the northern barbarians. The modern\r\nGreeks are also relatively short in stature, but are moderately\r\nround-headed. As to color these modern Greeks are substantially all dark\r\nas to eye and hair, with a somewhat swarthy skin.\r\n\r\nAmong Albanians and such Greeks as show blond traits light eyes are more\r\nthan ten times as numerous as light hair. The Albanians are members of\r\nthe tall, round-headed Dinaric race and have distant relationship with\r\nthe Nordics. They may possibly represent an ancient cross between\r\nNordics and Alpines and they constitute to-day a marked subdivision of\r\nthe latter. They resemble the Round Barrow brachycephs who entered\r\nBritain just before or at the opening of the Bronze Age and who are\r\nstill scantily represented among the living English and Welsh. This type\r\ncalled the Beaker Maker or Borreby type is characterized by a moderately\r\nround head and great stature, strength and considerable intellectual\r\nforce. The Albanian or Dinaric type was not, so far as we know,\r\nrepresented in ancient Greece although some modern archæologists have\r\nsuggested that the Spartans were of this type. We have as yet no\r\nevidence of the color, size and skull shape of the Spartans, but we do\r\nknow that their Dorian ancestors claimed to have come from or through\r\nthe mountains of northern Epirus (Albania). The Dorian dialects are also\r\nsaid to be more closely related to modern Albanian—which is derived from\r\nthe ancient Illyrian—than are the Ionian dialects. The Spartan\r\ncharacter, if that be any test of race, was heavy, slow and steady, and\r\nwould indicate northern rather than Mediterranean antecedents.\r\n\r\nConcerning modern Europe north of the Alps, culture came from the south\r\nand not from the east and to the Mediterranean subspecies is due the\r\nfoundation of our civilization. The ancient Mediterranean world was for\r\nthe most part of this race; the long-sustained civilization of Egypt,\r\nwhich endured for thousands of years in almost uninterrupted sequence;\r\nthe brilliant Minoan Empire of Crete, which flourished between 3000 and\r\n1200 B. C. and was the ancestor of the Mycenæan cultures of Greece,\r\nCyprus, Italy and Sardinia; the mysterious Empire of Etruria, the\r\npredecessor and teacher of Rome; the Hellenic states and colonies\r\nthroughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas; the maritime and mercantile\r\npower of Phœnicia and its mighty colony, imperial Carthage; all were the\r\ncreation of this race. The sea empire of Crete, when its royal palace at\r\nCnossos was burned by the ‘sea peoples’ of the north, passed to Tyre,\r\nSidon and Carthage and from them to the Greeks. The early development of\r\nthe art of navigation is to be attributed to this race and from them the\r\nNorth centuries later learned its maritime architecture.\r\n\r\nEven though the Mediterranean race has no claim to the invention of the\r\nsynthetic languages and though it played a relatively small part in the\r\ndevelopment of the civilization of the Middle Ages or of modern times,\r\nnevertheless to it belongs the chief credit of the classic civilization\r\nof Europe in the sciences, art, poetry, literature and philosophy, as\r\nwell as the major part of the civilization of Greece and a very large\r\nshare in the Empire of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Empire the Mediterraneans were the predominant factor\r\nunder the guise of Byzantine Greeks. Owing to the fact that our\r\nhistories have been written under the influence of Roman orthodoxy and\r\nbecause in the eyes of the Frankish Crusaders the Byzantine Greeks were\r\nheretics, they have been regarded by us as degenerate cowards.\r\n\r\nBut throughout the Middle Ages Byzantium represented in unbroken\r\nsequence the Empire of Rome in the East and as the capital of that\r\nEmpire it held Mohammedan Asia in check for nearly a thousand years.\r\nWhen at last in 1453 the imperial city deserted by western Christendom\r\nwas stormed by the Ottoman Turks and Constantine, last of Roman\r\nEmperors, fell sword in hand there was enacted one of the greatest\r\ntragedies of all time.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Constantinople the Empire of Rome passes finally from\r\nthe scene of history and the development of civilization is transferred\r\nfrom Mediterranean lands and from the Mediterranean race to the North\r\nSea and to the Nordic race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n                            THE NORDIC RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have shown that the Mediterranean race entered Europe from the south\r\nand forms part of a great group of peoples extending into southern Asia,\r\nthat the Alpine race came from the east through Asia Minor and the\r\nvalley of the Danube and that its present European distribution is\r\nmerely the westernmost point of an ethnic pyramid, the base of which\r\nrests solidly on the round skulled peoples of the great plateaux of\r\ncentral Asia. Both of these races are, therefore, western extensions of\r\nAsiatic subspecies and neither of them can be considered as exclusively\r\nEuropean.\r\n\r\nWith the remaining race, the Nordic, however, the case is different.\r\nThis is a purely European type, in the sense that it has developed its\r\nphysical characters and its civilization within the confines of that\r\ncontinent. It is, therefore, the _Homo europæus_, the white man par\r\nexcellence. It is everywhere characterized by certain unique\r\nspecializations, namely, wavy brown or blond hair and blue, gray or\r\nlight brown eyes, fair skin, high, narrow and straight nose, which are\r\nassociated with great stature and a long skull, as well as with abundant\r\nhead and body hair.\r\n\r\nA composite picture of this Nordic race and remarkable examples of its\r\nbest contemporary types can be found in the English illustrated\r\nweeklies, which are publishing during this great war the lists and\r\nportraits of their officers who have fallen in battle. No nation, not\r\neven England although richly endowed with a Nordic gentry, can stand the\r\nloss of so much good blood. Here is the evidence, if such be needed, of\r\nthe actual Passing of the Great Race.\r\n\r\nAbundance of hair is an ancient and generalized character which the\r\nNordics share with the Alpines of both Europe and Asia, but the light\r\ncolored eyes and light colored hair are characters of relatively recent\r\nspecialization and consequently highly unstable.\r\n\r\nThe pure Nordic race is at present clustered around the shores of the\r\nBaltic and North Seas from which it has spread west and south and east\r\nfading off gradually into the two preceding races.\r\n\r\nThe centre of its greatest purity is now in Sweden and there is no doubt\r\nthat at first the Scandinavian Peninsula and later, also, the\r\nimmediately adjoining shores of the Baltic were the centres of radiation\r\nof the Teutonic or Scandinavian branch of this race.\r\n\r\nThe population of Scandinavia has been composed of this Nordic\r\nsubspecies from the commencement of Neolithic times and Sweden to-day\r\nrepresents one of the few countries which has never been overwhelmed by\r\nforeign conquest and in which there has been but a single racial type\r\nfrom the beginning. This nation is unique in its unity of race,\r\nlanguage, religion and social ideals.\r\n\r\nSouthern Scandinavia only became fit for human habitation on the retreat\r\nof the glaciers about twelve thousand years ago and apparently was\r\nimmediately occupied by the Nordic race. This is one of the few\r\ngeological dates which is absolute and not relative. It rests on a most\r\ninteresting series of computations made by Baron DeGeer, based on an\r\nactual count of the laminated deposits of clay laid down annually by the\r\nretreating glaciers, each layer representing the summer deposit of the\r\nsubglacial stream.\r\n\r\nThe Nordics first appear at the close of the Paleolithic along the\r\ncoasts of the Baltic. The earliest industry discovered in this region,\r\nnamed the Maglemose and found in Denmark and elsewhere around the\r\nBaltic, is probably the culture of the Proto-Teutonic branch of the\r\nNordic race. No human remains in connection therewith have been found.\r\n\r\nThe vigor and power of the Nordic race as a whole is such that it could\r\nnot have been evolved in so restricted an area as southern Sweden\r\nalthough its Teutonic or Scandinavian section did develop there in\r\ncomparative isolation. The Nordics must have had a larger field for\r\ntheir specialization and a longer period for their evolution than is\r\nafforded by the limited time which has elapsed since Sweden became\r\nhabitable. For the development of so marked a type there is required a\r\ncontinental area isolated and protected for long ages from the intrusion\r\nof other races. The climatic conditions must have been such as to impose\r\na rigid elimination of defectives through the agency of hard winters and\r\nthe necessity of industry and foresight in providing the year’s food,\r\nclothing and shelter during the short summer. Such demands on energy if\r\nlong continued would produce a strong, virile and self-contained race\r\nwhich would inevitably overwhelm in battle nations whose weaker elements\r\nhad not been purged by the conditions of an equally severe environment.\r\n\r\nAn area conforming to these requirements is offered by the forests and\r\nplains of eastern Germany, Poland and Russia. It was here that the\r\nProto-Nordic type evolved and here their remnants are found. They were\r\nprotected from Asia on the east by the then almost continuous water\r\nconnections across eastern Russia between the White Sea and the old\r\nCaspian-Aral Sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the last glacial advance (known as the Würm) which, like the\r\npreceding glaciations, is believed to have been a period of land\r\ndepression, the White Sea extended far to the south of its present\r\nlimits, while the enlarged Caspian Sea, then and long afterward\r\nconnected with the Sea of Aral, extended northward to the great bend of\r\nthe Volga. The intermediate area was studded with large lakes and\r\nmorasses. Thus an almost complete water barrier of shallow sea located\r\njust west of the low Ural Mountains, separated Europe from Asia during\r\nthe Würm glaciation and the following period of glacial retreat. The\r\nbroken connection was restored just before the dawn of history by a\r\nslight elevation of the land and the shrinking of the Caspian-Aral Sea\r\nthrough the increasing desiccation which has left its present surface\r\nbelow sea level.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the maintenance of the isolation of this Nordic\r\ncradle on the south is the fact that from earliest times down to this\r\nday the pressure of population has been unchangeably from the bleak and\r\nsterile north, southward and eastward, into the sunny but enervating\r\nlands of France, Italy, Greece, Persia and India.\r\n\r\nIn these forests and steppes of the north, the Nordic race gradually\r\nevolved in isolation and at an early date spread north over the\r\nScandinavian Peninsula together with much of the land now submerged\r\nunder the Baltic and North Seas.\r\n\r\nNordic strains form everywhere a substratum of population throughout\r\nRussia and underlie the round skulled Slavs who first appear a little\r\nover a thousand years ago as coming not from the direction of Asia but\r\nfrom south Poland. Burial mounds called kurgans are widely scattered\r\nthroughout Russia from the Carpathians to the Urals and contain numerous\r\nremains of a dolichocephalic race,—in fact, more than three-fourths of\r\nthe skulls are of this type. Round skulls first become numerous in\r\nancient Russian graveyards about 900 A. D. and soon increase to such an\r\nextent that in the Slavic period from the ninth to the thirteenth\r\ncenturies one-half of the skulls were brachycephalic, while in modern\r\ncemeteries the proportion of round skulls is still greater. The ancient\r\nNordic element, however, still forms a very considerable portion of the\r\npopulation of northern Russia and contributes the blondness and the\r\nred-headedness so characteristic of the Russian of to-day. As we leave\r\nthe Baltic coasts the Nordic characters fade out both toward the south\r\nand east. The blond element in the nobility of Russia is of later\r\nScandinavian and Teutonic origin.\r\n\r\nWhen the seas which separated Russia from Asia dried, when the isolation\r\nand exacting climate of the north had done their work and produced the\r\nvigorous Nordic type, and when in the fulness of time bronze for their\r\nweapons reached them these men burst upon the southern races, conquering\r\neast, south and west. They brought with them from the north the\r\nhardihood and vigor acquired under the rigorous selection of a long\r\nwinter season and vanquished in battle the inhabitants of older and\r\nfeebler civilizations, but only to succumb in their turn to the\r\nsoftening influences of a life of ease and plenty in their new homes.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded appearance of Aryan-speaking Nordics is our first\r\ndim vision of the Sacæ introducing Sanskrit into India, the Cimmerians\r\npouring through the passes of the Caucasus from the grasslands of South\r\nRussia to invade the Empire of the Medes and the Achæans and Phrygians\r\nconquering Greece and the Ægean coast of Asia Minor. About 1100 B. C.\r\nNordics enter Italy as Umbrians and Oscans and soon after other Nordics\r\ncross the Rhine into Gaul. The latter were the western vanguard of the\r\nCeltic-speaking tribes which had long occupied those districts in\r\nGermany which lay south and west of the Teutonic Nordics. These Teutons\r\nat this early date were confined probably to Scandinavia and the\r\nimmediate shores of the Baltic and were just beginning to press\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis first Celtic wave of Nordics seems to have swept westward along the\r\nsandy plains of northern Europe, and entered France through the Low\r\nCountries. From this point as Goidels they spread north into Britain,\r\nreaching there about 800 B. C. As Gauls they conquered all France and\r\npushed on southward and westward into Spain and over the Maritime Alps\r\ninto northern Italy, where they encountered the kindred Nordic Umbrians,\r\nwho at an earlier date had crossed the Alps from the northeast. Other\r\nCeltic-speaking Nordics apparently migrated up the Rhine and down the\r\nDanube and by the time the Romans came on the scene the Alpines of\r\ncentral Europe had been thoroughly Celticized. These tribes pushed\r\neastward into southern Russia and reached the Crimea as early as the\r\nfourth century B. C. Mixed with the natives, they were called by the\r\nGreeks the Celto-Scyths. This swarming out of what is now called Germany\r\nof the first Nordics was during the closing phases of the Bronze Period\r\nand was contemporary with and probably caused by the first great\r\nexpansion of the Teutons from Scandinavia by way both of Denmark and the\r\nBaltic coasts.\r\n\r\nThese invaders were succeeded by a second wave of Celtic-speaking\r\npeoples, the Cymry or Brythons, who drove their Goidelic predecessors\r\nstill farther westward and exterminated and absorbed them over large\r\nareas. These Cymric invasions occurred about 300–100 B. C. and were\r\nprobably the result of the growing development of the Teutons and their\r\nfinal expulsion of the Celtic-speaking tribes from Germany. These Cymry\r\noccupied northern France under the name of Belgæ and invaded England as\r\nBrythons in several waves, the last being the true Belgæ. The conquests\r\nof these Cymric tribes in both Gaul and Britain were only checked by the\r\nlegions of Rome.\r\n\r\nThese migrations are exceedingly hard to trace because of the confusion\r\ncaused by the fact that Celtic speech is now found on the lips of\r\npopulations in nowise related to the Nordics who first introduced it.\r\nBut one fact stands out clearly, all the original Celtic-speaking tribes\r\nwere Nordic.\r\n\r\nWhat were the special physical characters of these tribes in which they\r\ndiffered from their Teutonic successors is now impossible to say, beyond\r\nthe possible suggestion that in the British Isles the Scottish and Irish\r\npopulations in which red hair and gray or green eyes are abundant have\r\nrather more of this Celtic strain in them than have the flaxen haired\r\nTeutons, whose china-blue eyes are clearly not Celtic.\r\n\r\nWhen the peoples called Gauls or Celts by the Romans and Galatians by\r\nthe Greeks first appear in history they are described in exactly the\r\nsame terms as were later the Teutons. They were all gigantic barbarians\r\nwith fair and very often red hair, then more frequent than to-day, with\r\ngray or fiercely blue eyes and were thus clearly members of the Nordic\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\nThe first Celtic-speaking nations with whom the Romans came in contact\r\nwere Gaulish and had probably incorporated much Alpine blood by the time\r\nthey crossed the mountains into the domain of classic history. The\r\nNordic element had become still weaker by absorption from the conquered\r\npopulations when at a later date the Romans broke through the ring of\r\nCeltic nations and came into contact with the Nordic Cymry and Teutons.\r\n\r\nAfter these early expansions of Gauls and Cymry the Teutons appear upon\r\nthe scene. Of the pure Teutons within the ken of history, it is not\r\nnecessary to mention more than the most important of the long series of\r\nconquering tribes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of them all were perhaps the Goths, who came originally\r\nfrom the south of Sweden and were long located on the opposite German\r\ncoast at the mouth of the Vistula. From here they crossed Poland to the\r\nCrimea where they were known in the first century. Three hundred years\r\nlater they were driven westward by the Huns and forced into the Dacian\r\nplain and over the Danube into the Roman Empire. There they split up;\r\nthe Ostrogoths after a period of subjection to the Huns on the Danube,\r\nravaged the European provinces of the Eastern Empire, conquered Italy\r\nand founded there a great but shortlived nation. The Visigoths occupied\r\nmuch of Gaul and then entered Spain driving the Nordic Vandals before\r\nthem into Africa. The Teutons and Cimbri, destroyed by Marius in\r\nsouthern Gaul about 100 B. C., the Gepidæ, the Alans, the Suevi, the\r\nVandals, the Alemanni of the upper Rhine, the Marcomanni, the Saxons,\r\nthe Batavians, the Frisians, the Angles, the Jutes, the Lombards and the\r\nHeruli of Italy, the Burgundians of the east of France, the Franks of\r\nthe lower Rhine, the Danes, and, latest of all, the Norse Vikings emerge\r\nfrom the northern forests and seas one after another and sweep through\r\nhistory. Less well known but of great importance are the Varangians, who\r\ncoming from Sweden in the ninth and tenth centuries, conquered the coast\r\nof the Gulf of Finland and much of White Russia and left there a dynasty\r\nand aristocracy of Nordic blood. In the tenth and eleventh centuries\r\nthey were the rulers of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of Goths, Vandals, Lombards and Burgundians all point to\r\nSweden as their earliest homeland and probably all the pure Teutonic\r\ntribes came originally from Scandinavia and were closely related.\r\n\r\nWhen these Teutonic tribes poured down from the Baltic coasts, their\r\nCeltic-speaking Nordic predecessors were already much mixed with the\r\nunderlying populations, Mediterranean in the west and Alpine in the\r\nsouth. These “Celts” were not recognized by the Teutons as kin in any\r\nsense and were all called, Welsh, or foreigners. From this word are\r\nderived the names “Wales,” “Cornwales” or “Cornwall,” “Valais,”\r\n“Walloons,” and “Vlach” or “Wallachian.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                            TEUTONIC EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo proper understanding is possible of the meaning of the history of\r\nChristendom or full appreciation of the place in it of the Teutonic\r\nNordics without a brief review of the events in Europe of the last two\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nWhen Rome fell and changed trade conditions necessitated the transfer of\r\npower from its historic capital in Italy to a strategic situation on the\r\nBosporus, western Europe was definitely and finally abandoned to its\r\nTeutonic invaders. These same barbarians swept up again and again to the\r\nPropontis, only to recoil before the organized strength of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire and the walls of Mikklegard. The final line of cleavage between\r\nthe western and eastern Empires corresponded closely to the boundaries\r\nof Latin and Greek speech and differences of language no doubt were the\r\nchief cause of the political and later of the religious divergence\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nUntil the coming of the Alpine Slavs the Eastern Empire still held in\r\nEurope the Balkan Peninsula and much of the eastern Mediterranean. The\r\nWestern Empire, however, collapsed utterly under the impact of hordes of\r\nNordic Teutons at a much earlier date. In the fourth and fifth centuries\r\nof our era north Africa, once the empire of Carthage, had become the\r\nseat of the kingdom of Nordic Vandals. Spain fell under the control of\r\nthe Visigoths and Lusitania, now Portugal, under that of the Suevi. Gaul\r\nwas Visigothic in the south and Burgundian in the east, while the\r\nFrankish kingdom dominated the north until it finally absorbed and\r\nincorporated all the territories of ancient Gaul and made it the land of\r\nthe Franks. Strictly speaking, the northern half of France and the\r\nadjoining districts, the country of Langued’oil, is the true land of the\r\nFranks while the southern Languedoc was never Frankish except by\r\nconquest, and was never as thoroughly Nordicized as the north. Whatever\r\nNordic elements are still to be found there are Gothic and Burgundian\r\nbut not Frankish.\r\n\r\nItaly fell under the control first of the Ostrogoths and then of the\r\nLombards. The purely Nordic Saxons with kindred tribes conquered the\r\nBritish Isles and meanwhile the Norse and Danish Scandinavians\r\ncontributed a large element to all the coast populations as far south as\r\nSpain and the Swedes organized in the eastern Baltic what is now Russia.\r\n\r\nThus when Rome passed all Europe had become superficially Teutonic. At\r\nfirst these Teutons were isolated and independent tribes bearing some\r\nshadowy relation to the one organized state they knew, the Empire of\r\nRome. Then came the Mohammedan invasion, which reached western Europe\r\nfrom Africa and destroyed the Visigothic kingdom. The Moslems swept on\r\nunchecked until their light horsemen dashed themselves to pieces against\r\nthe heavy armed cavalry of Charles Martel and his Franks at Tours in 732\r\nA. D.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Vandal kingdom by the armies of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire, the conquest of Spain by the Moors and finally the overthrow of\r\nthe Lombards by the Franks were all greatly facilitated by the fact that\r\nthese barbarians, Vandals, Goths, Suevi and Lombards, with the sole\r\nexception of the Franks, were originally Christians of the Arian or\r\nUnitarian confession and as such were regarded as heretics by their\r\northodox Christian subjects. The Franks alone were converted from\r\nheathenism directly to the Trinitarian faith to which the old\r\npopulations of the Roman Empire adhered. From this orthodoxy of the\r\nFranks arose the close relation between France, “the eldest daughter of\r\nthe church,” and the papacy, a connection which lasted for more than a\r\nthousand years—in fact nearly to our own day.\r\n\r\nWith the Goths eliminated western Christendom became Frankish. In the\r\nyear 800 A. D. Charlemagne was crowned at Rome and re-established the\r\nRoman Empire in the west, which included all Christendom outside of the\r\nByzantine Empire. In some form or shape this Roman Empire endured until\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century and during all that time it\r\nformed the basis of the political concept of European man.\r\n\r\nThis same concept lies to-day at the root of the imperial idea. Kaiser,\r\nTsar and Emperor each takes his name and in some way undertakes to trace\r\nhis title from Cæsar and the Empire. Charlemagne and his successors\r\nclaimed and often exercised overlordship as to all the other continental\r\nChristian nations and when the Crusades began it was the German Emperor\r\nwho led the Frankish hosts against the Saracens. Charlemagne was a\r\nGerman Emperor, his capital was at Aachen within the present limits of\r\nthe German Empire and the language of his court was German. For several\r\ncenturies after the conquest of Gaul by the Franks their Teutonic tongue\r\nheld its own against the Latin speech of the Romanized Gauls.\r\n\r\nThe history of all Christian Europe is in some degree interwoven with\r\nthis Holy Roman Empire. Though the Empire was neither holy nor Roman but\r\naltogether secular and Teutonic, it was, nevertheless, the heart of\r\nEurope for ages. Holland and Flanders, Lorraine and Alsace, Burgundy and\r\nLuxemburg, Lombardy and the Veneto, Switzerland and Austria, Bohemia and\r\nStyria are states which were originally component parts of the Empire\r\nalthough many of them have since been torn away by rival nations or have\r\nbecome independent, while much of northern Italy remained under the sway\r\nof Austria within the memory of living men.\r\n\r\nThe Empire wasted its strength in imperial ambitions and foreign\r\nconquests instead of consolidating, organizing and unifying its own\r\nterritories and the fact that the imperial crown was elective for many\r\ngenerations before it became hereditary in the House of Hapsburg checked\r\nthe unification of Germany during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nA strong hereditary monarchy, such as arose in England and in France,\r\nwould have anticipated the Germany of to-day by a thousand years and\r\nmade it the predominant state in Christendom, but disruptive elements in\r\nthe persons of great territorial dukes were successful throughout its\r\nhistory in preventing an effective concentration of power in the hands\r\nof the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThat the German Emperor was regarded, though vaguely, as the overlord of\r\nall Christian monarchs was clearly indicated when Henry VIII of England\r\nand Francis I of France appeared as candidates for the imperial crown\r\nagainst Charles of Spain, afterward the Emperor Charles V.\r\n\r\nEurope was the Holy Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire was Europe\r\npredominantly until the Thirty Years’ War. This war was perhaps the\r\ngreatest catastrophe of all the ghastly crimes committed in the name of\r\nreligion. It destroyed an entire generation, taking each year for thirty\r\nyears the finest manhood of the nations.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the population of Germany was destroyed, in some states\r\nsuch as Bohemia three-fourths of the inhabitants were killed or exiled,\r\nwhile out of 500,000 inhabitants in Würtemberg there were only 48,000\r\nleft at the end of the war. Terrible as this loss was, the destruction\r\ndid not fall equally on the various races and classes in the community.\r\nIt bore, of course, most heavily upon the big blond fighting man and at\r\nthe end of the war the German states contained a greatly lessened\r\nproportion of Nordic blood. In fact, from that time on the purely\r\nTeutonic race in Germany has been largely replaced by the Alpine types\r\nin the south and by the Wendish and the Polish types in the east. This\r\nchange of race in Germany has gone so far that it has been computed that\r\nout of the 70,000,000 inhabitants of the German Empire, only 9,000,000\r\nare purely Teutonic in coloration, stature and skull characters. The\r\nrarity of pure Teutonic and Nordic types among the German immigrants to\r\nAmerica in contrast to its almost universal prevalence among those from\r\nScandinavia is traceable to the same cause.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Thirty Years’ War virtually destroyed the land owning\r\nyeomanry and lesser gentry formerly found in mediæval Germany as\r\nnumerously as in France or in England. The religious wars of France,\r\nwhile not as devasting to the nation as a whole as was the Thirty Years’\r\nWar in Germany, nevertheless greatly weakened the French cavalier type,\r\nthe “petite noblesse de province.” In Germany this class had flourished\r\nand throughout the Middle Ages contributed great numbers of knights,\r\npoets, thinkers, artists and artisans who gave charm and variety to the\r\nsociety of central Europe. But, as said, this section of the population\r\nwas practically exterminated in the Thirty Years’ War and this class of\r\ngentlemen practically vanishes from German history from that time on.\r\n\r\nWhen the Thirty Years’ War was over there remained in Germany nothing\r\nexcept the brutalized peasantry, largely of Alpine derivation in the\r\nsouth and east, and the high nobility which turned from the toils of\r\nendless warfare to mimic on a small scale the court of Versailles. After\r\nthis long struggle the boundaries in central Europe between the\r\nProtestant North and the Catholic South follow in a marked degree the\r\nfrontier between the northern plain inhabited chiefly by Nordics and the\r\nmore mountainous countries in the south populated almost entirely by\r\nAlpines.\r\n\r\nIt has taken Germany two centuries to recover her vigor, her wealth and\r\nher aspirations to a place in the sun.\r\n\r\nDuring these years Germany was a political nonentity, a mere congeries\r\nof petty states bickering and fighting with each other, claiming and\r\nowning only the Empire of the Air as Napoleon happily phrased it.\r\nMeantime France and England founded their colonial empires beyond the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nWhen in the last generation Germany became unified and organized, she\r\nfound herself not only too late to share in these colonial enterprises,\r\nbut also lacking in much of the racial element and still more lacking in\r\nthe very classes which were her greatest strength and glory before the\r\nThirty Years’ War. To-day the ghastly rarity in the German armies of\r\nchivalry and generosity toward women and of knightly protection and\r\ncourtesy toward the prisoners or wounded can be largely attributed to\r\nthis annihilation of the gentle classes. The Germans of to-day, whether\r\nthey live on the farms or in the cities, are for the most part\r\ndescendants of the peasants who survived, not of the brilliant knights\r\nand sturdy foot soldiers who fell in that mighty conflict. Knowledge of\r\nthis great past when Europe was Teutonic and memories of the shadowy\r\ngrandeur of the Hohenstaufen Emperors, who, generation after generation,\r\nled Teutonic armies over the Alps to assert their title to Italian\r\nprovinces, have played no small part in modern German consciousness.\r\n\r\nThese traditions and the knowledge that their own religious dissensions\r\nswept them from the leadership of the European world lie at the base of\r\nthe German imperial ideal of to-day and it is for this ideal that the\r\nGerman armies are dying, just as did their ancestors for a thousand\r\nyears under their Fredericks, Henrys, Conrads and Ottos.\r\n\r\nBut the Empire of Rome and the Empire of Charlemagne are no more and the\r\nTeutonic type is divided almost equally between the contending forces in\r\nthis world war. With the United States in the field the balance of pure\r\nNordic blood will be heavily against the Central Powers, which pride\r\nthemselves on being “the Teutonic powers.”\r\n\r\nGermany is too late and is limited to a destiny fixed and ordained for\r\nher on the fatal day in 1618 when the Hapsburg Ferdinand forced the\r\nProtestants of Bohemia into revolt.\r\n\r\nAlthough as a result of the Thirty Years’ War the German Empire is far\r\nless Nordic than in the Middle Ages, the north and northwest of Germany\r\nare still Teutonic throughout and in the east and south the Alpines have\r\nbeen thoroughly Germanized with an aristocracy and upper class very\r\nlargely of pure Teutonic blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n                      THE EXPANSION OF THE NORDICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men of Nordic blood to-day form practically all the population of\r\nScandinavian countries, as also a majority of the population of the\r\nBritish Isles and are almost pure in type in Scotland and eastern and\r\nnorthern England. The Nordic realm includes nearly all the northern\r\nthird of France with extensions into the fertile southwest; all the rich\r\nlowlands of Flanders; all Holland; the northern half of Germany with\r\nextensions up the Rhine and down the Danube; and the north of Poland and\r\nof Russia. Recent calculations indicate that there are about 90,000,000\r\nof purely Nordic physical type in Europe out of a total population of\r\n420,000,000.\r\n\r\nThroughout southern Europe a Nordic nobility of Teutonic type everywhere\r\nforms the old aristocratic and military classes or what now remains of\r\nthem. These aristocrats, by as much as their blood is pure, are taller\r\nand blonder than the native populations, whether these be Alpine in\r\ncentral Europe or Mediterranean in Spain or in the south of France and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe countries speaking Low German dialects are almost purely Nordic but\r\nthe populations of High German speech are very largely Teutonized\r\nAlpines and occupy lands once Celtic-speaking. The main distinction\r\nbetween the two dialects is the presence of a large number of Celtic\r\nelements in High German.\r\n\r\nIn northern Italy there is a large amount of Nordic blood. In Lombardy,\r\nVenice and elsewhere throughout the country the aristocracy is blonder\r\nand taller than the peasantry, but the Nordic element in Italy has\r\ndeclined noticeably since the Middle Ages. From Roman times onward for a\r\nthousand years the Teutons swarmed into northern Italy, through the Alps\r\nand chiefly by way of the Brenner Pass. With the stoppage of these\r\nNordic reinforcements this strain seems to have grown less all through\r\nItaly.[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Procopius tells a significant story which illustrates the contrast in\r\n  racial character between the natives and the barbarians. He relates\r\n  that, at the surrender of Ravenna in 540 A. D. by the Goths to the\r\n  army of the Byzantines, “when the Gothic women saw how swarthy, small\r\n  men of mean aspect had conquered their tall, robust, fair-skinned\r\n  barbarians, they were furious and spat in their husbands’ faces and\r\n  cursed them for cowards.”\r\n\r\nIn the Balkan Peninsula there is little to show for the floods of Nordic\r\nblood that have poured in for the last 3,500 years, beginning with the\r\nAchæans of Homer, who first appeared _en masse_ about 1400 B. C. and\r\nwere followed successively by the Dorians, Cimmerians and Gauls, down to\r\nthe Goths and the Varangians of Byzantine times.\r\n\r\nThe tall stature of the population along the Illyrian Alps from the\r\nTyrol to Albania on the south is undoubtedly of Nordic origin and dates\r\nfrom some of these early invasions, but these Illyrians have been so\r\ncrossed with Slavs that all other blond elements have been lost and the\r\nexisting population is essentially of brachycephalic Alpine type. They\r\nare known as the Dinaric race. What few remnants of blondness occur in\r\nthis district, more particularly in Albania, as well as the so-called\r\nFrankish elements in Bosnia, may probably be attributed to later\r\ninfiltrations.\r\n\r\nThe Tyrolese seem to be largely Nordic except in respect to their round\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nIn Russia and in Poland the Nordic stature, blondness and long skull\r\ngrow less and less pronounced as one proceeds south and east from the\r\nGulf of Finland.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in all those parts of Europe outside of its natural\r\nhabitat, the Nordic blood is on the wane from England to Italy and that\r\nthe ancient, acclimated and primitive populations of Alpine and\r\nMediterranean race are subtly reasserting their long lost political\r\npower through a high breeding rate and democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nIn western Europe the first wave of the Nordic tribes appeared about\r\nthree thousand years ago and was followed by other invasions with the\r\nNordic element becoming stronger until after the fall of Rome whole\r\ntribes moved into its provinces, Teutonizing them more or less for\r\nvarying lengths of time.\r\n\r\n       PROVISIONAL OUTLINE OF NORDIC INVASIONS AND METAL CULTURES\r\n\r\n ┌───┬───────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n │   │   B.

chiefly\r\nAlpine, has proceeded steadily since the Frankish Charlemagne destroyed\r\nthe Lombard kingdom and is proceeding with unabated vigor to-day. This\r\nprocess was greatly accelerated in western Europe by the Crusades, which\r\nwere extremely destructive to the Nordic feudal lords, especially the\r\nFrankish and Norman nobility and was continued by the wars of the\r\nReformation and by those of the Revolution. The world war now in full\r\nswing with its toll of millions will leave Europe much poorer in Nordic\r\nblood. One of its most certain results will be the partial destruction\r\nof the aristocratic classes everywhere in northern Europe. In England\r\nthe nobility has already suffered in battle more than in any century\r\nsince the Wars of the Roses. This will tend to realize the\r\nstandardization of type so dear to democratic ideals. If equality cannot\r\nbe obtained by lengthening and uplifting the stunted of body and of\r\nmind, it can be at least realized by the destruction of the exalted of\r\nstature and of soul. The bed of Procrustes operates with the same fatal\r\nexactness when it shortens the long as when it stretches the undersized.\r\n\r\nThe first Nordics in Spain were the Gauls who crossed the western\r\nPyrenees about the end of the sixth century before our era and\r\nintroduced Aryan speech into the Iberian Peninsula. They quickly mixed\r\nwith Mediterranean natives and the composite Spaniards were called\r\nCeltiberians by the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal and Spain there are in the physical structure of the\r\npopulation few traces of these early Celtic-speaking Nordic invaders but\r\nthe Suevi, who a thousand years later occupied parts of Portugal, and\r\nthe Vandals and Visigoths, who conquered and held Spain for 300 years,\r\nhave left some small evidence of their blood. In the provinces of\r\nnorthern Spain a considerable percentage of light colored eyes reveals\r\nthese Nordic elements in the population.\r\n\r\nDeep seated Castilian traditions associate aristocracy with blondness\r\nand the _sangre azul_, or blue blood of Spain, probably refers to the\r\nblue eye of the Goth, whose traditional claim to lordship is also shown\r\nin the Spanish name for gentleman, “hidalgo,” said to mean “the son of\r\nthe Goth.” The fact that the blood shows as “blue” through the fair\r\nNordic skin is also to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAs long as this Gothic nobility controlled the Spanish states during the\r\nendless crusades against the Moors, Spain belonged to the Nordic\r\nkingdoms, but when their blood became impaired by losses in wars waged\r\noutside of Spain and in the conquest of the Americas, the sceptre fell\r\nfrom this noble race into the hands of the native Iberian, who had not\r\nthe physical vigor or the intellectual strength to maintain the world\r\nempire built up by the stronger race. For 200 years the Spanish infantry\r\nhad no equal in Europe but this distinction disappeared with the opening\r\ndecades of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe splendid conquistadores of the New World were of Nordic type, but\r\ntheir pure stock did not long survive their new surroundings and to-day\r\nthey have vanished utterly, leaving behind them only their language and\r\ntheir religion. After considering well these facts we shall not have to\r\nsearch further for the causes of the collapse of Spain.\r\n\r\nGaul at the time of Cæsar’s conquest was under the rule of the Nordic\r\nrace, which furnished the bulk of the population of the north as well as\r\nthe military classes elsewhere and, while the Romans killed off an undue\r\nproportion of this fighting element, the power and vigor of the French\r\nnation have been based on this blood and its later reinforcements. In\r\nfact, in the Europe of to-day the amount of Nordic blood in each nation\r\nis a very fair measure of its strength in war and standing in\r\ncivilization. The proportion of men of pure type of each constituent\r\nrace to the mixed type is also a powerful factor.\r\n\r\nWhen, about 1000 B. C., the first Nordics crossed the lower Rhine they\r\nfound the Mediterranean race in France everywhere overwhelmed by an\r\nAlpine population except in the south. Long before the time of Cæsar the\r\nCeltic language of these invaders had been imposed upon the entire\r\npopulation and the country had been saturated with Nordic blood, except\r\nin Aquitaine which seems to have retained until at least that date its\r\nAnaryan Iberian speech. These earliest Nordics in the west were known to\r\nthe ancient world as Gauls. These Gauls, or “Celts,” as they were called\r\nby Cæsar, occupied in his day the centre of France. The actual racial\r\ncomplexion of this part of France was overwhelmingly Alpine then and is\r\nso now, but this population had been Celticized thoroughly by the Gauls,\r\njust as it was Latinized as completely at a later date by the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe northern third of France, that is above Paris, was inhabited in\r\nCæsar’s time by the Belgæ, a Nordic people of the Cymric division of\r\nCeltic speech. They were largely of Teutonic blood and in fact should be\r\nregarded as the immediate forerunners of the Germans. They probably\r\nrepresent the early Teutons who had crossed from Sweden and adopted the\r\nCeltic speech of their Nordic kindred whom they found on the mainland.\r\nThese Belgæ had followed the earlier Goidels across Germany into Britain\r\nand Gaul and were rapidly displacing their Nordic predecessors, who by\r\nthis time were much weakened by mixture with the autochthones, when Rome\r\nappeared upon the scene and set a limit to their conquests by the Pax\r\nRomana.\r\n\r\nThe Belgæ of the north of France and the Low Countries were the bravest\r\nof the peoples of Gaul, according to Cæsar’s oft-quoted remark, but the\r\nclaim of the modern Belgians to descent from this race is without basis\r\nand rests solely on the fact that the present kingdom of Belgium, which\r\nonly became independent and assumed its proud name in 1831, occupies a\r\nsmall and relatively unimportant corner of the land of the Belgæ. The\r\nFlemings of Belgium are Nordic Franks speaking a Low German tongue and\r\nthe Walloons are Alpines whose language is an archaic French.\r\n\r\nThe Belgæ and the Goidelic remnants of Nordic blood in the centre of\r\nGaul taken together probably constituted only a small minority in blood\r\nof the population, but were everywhere the military and ruling classes.\r\nThese Nordic elements were later reinforced by powerful Teutonic tribes,\r\nnamely, Vandals, Visigoths, Alans, Saxons, Burgundians and, most\r\nimportant of all, the Franks of the lower Rhine, who founded modern\r\nFrance and made it for long centuries “_la grande nation_” of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nThe Frankish dynasties long after Charlemagne were of purely Teutonic\r\nblood and the aristocratic land owning and military classes down to the\r\ngreat Revolution were very largely of this type, which by the time of\r\nthe creation of the Frankish kingdom had incorporated all the other\r\nNordic elements of old Roman Gaul, both Gaulish and Belgic.\r\n\r\nThe last invasion of Teutonic-speaking barbarians was that of the Danish\r\nNorthmen, who were, of course, of unmixed Nordic blood and who conquered\r\nand settled Normandy in 911 A. D. No sooner had the barbarian invasions\r\nceased than the ancient aboriginal blood strains, Mediterranean, Alpine\r\nand elements derived from Paleolithic times, began a slow and steady\r\nrecovery. Step by step with the reappearance of these primitive and deep\r\nrooted stocks the Nordic element in France declined and with it the\r\nvigor of the nation. Even in Normandy the Alpines now tend to\r\npredominate and the French blonds are becoming more and more limited to\r\nthe northeastern and eastern provinces.\r\n\r\nThe chief historic events of the last thousand years have hastened this\r\nprocess and the fact that the Nordic element everywhere forms the\r\nfighting section of the community caused the loss in war to fall\r\ndisproportionately as among the three races in France. The religious\r\nwars greatly weakened the Nordic provincial nobility, which was before\r\nthe Massacre of St. Bartholomew largely Protestant and the extermination\r\nof the upper classes was hastened by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic\r\nwars. These last wars are said to have shortened the stature of the\r\nFrench by four inches; in other words, the tall Nordic strain was killed\r\noff in greater proportions than the little brunet.\r\n\r\nWhen by universal suffrage the transfer of power was completed from a\r\nNordic aristocracy to lower classes predominantly of Alpine and\r\nMediterranean extraction, the decline of France in international power\r\nset in. In the country as a whole, the long skulled Mediterraneans are\r\nalso yielding rapidly to the round skulled Alpines and the average of\r\nthe cephalic index in France has steadily risen since the Middle Ages\r\nand is still rising.\r\n\r\nThe survivors of the aristocracy, being stripped of political power and\r\nto a large extent of wealth, quickly lost their caste pride and\r\ncommitted class suicide by mixing their blood with inferior breeds. One\r\nof the most conspicuous features of some of the French nobility of\r\nto-day is the strength of Oriental and Mediterranean strains in them.\r\nBeing for political reasons ardently clerical the nobility welcomes\r\nrecruits of any racial origin as long as they bring with them money and\r\ndevotion to the Church.\r\n\r\nThe loss in war of the best stock through death, wounds or absence from\r\nhome has been clearly shown in France. The conscripts who were examined\r\nfor military duty in 1890–2 were those descended in a large measure from\r\nthe military rejects and other stay-at-homes during the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar. In Dordogne this contingent showed seven per cent more deficient\r\nstatures than the normal rate. In some cantons this unfortunate\r\ngeneration was in height an inch below the recruits of preceding years\r\nand in it the exemptions for defective physique rose from the normal six\r\nper cent to sixteen per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen each generation is decimated or destroyed in turn a race can be\r\ninjured beyond recovery but it more frequently happens that the result\r\nis the annihilation of an entire class, as in the case of the German\r\ngentry in the Thirty Years’ War. Desolation of wide districts often\r\nresulted from the plagues and famines which followed the armies in old\r\ndays but deaths from these causes fall most heavily on the weaker part\r\nof the population. The loss of valuable breeding stock is far more\r\nserious when wars are fought with volunteer armies of picked men than\r\nwith conscript armies, because in the latter cases the loss is more\r\nevenly spread over the whole nation. Before England resorted in the\r\npresent war to universal conscription the injury to her more desirable\r\nand patriotic classes was much more pronounced than in Germany where all\r\ntypes and ranks were called to arms.\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles we find, before the appearance of the Nordic race,\r\na Mediterranean population and no important element of Alpine blood, so\r\nthat at the present day we have to deal with only two of the main races\r\ninstead of all three as in France. In Britain there were, as elsewhere,\r\nrepresentatives of earlier races but the preponderant strain of blood\r\nwas Mediterranean before the first arrival of the Aryan-speaking\r\nNordics.\r\n\r\nIreland was connected with Britain and Britain with the continent until\r\ntimes very recent in a geological sense. The depression of the Channel\r\ncoasts is progressing rapidly to-day and is known to have been\r\nsubstantial during historic times. The close parallel in blood and\r\nculture between England and the opposite coasts of France also indicates\r\na very recent land connection, possibly in early Neolithic times. Men\r\neither walked from the continent to England and from England to Ireland,\r\nor they paddled across in primitive boats or coracles. The art of\r\nship-building or even archaic navigation cannot go much further back\r\nthan late Neolithic times.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic tribes of Celtic speech came to the British Isles in two\r\ndistinct waves. The earlier invasion of the Goidels, who were still in\r\nthe Bronze culture, arrived in England about 800 B. C. and in Ireland\r\ntwo centuries later. It was part of the same movement which brought the\r\nGauls into France. The later conquest was by the Cymric-speaking Belgæ\r\nwho were equipped with iron weapons. It began in the third century B. C.\r\nand was still going on in Cæsar’s time. These Cymric Brythons found the\r\nearly Goidels, with the exception of the aristocracy, much weakened by\r\nintermixture with the Mediterranean natives and would probably have\r\ndestroyed all trace of Goidelic speech in Ireland and Scotland, as they\r\nactually did in England, if the Romans had not intervened. The Brythons\r\nreached Ireland in small numbers only in the second century B. C.\r\n\r\nThese Nordic elements in Britain, both Goidelic and Brythonic, were in a\r\nminority during Roman times and the ethnic complexion of the island was\r\nnot much affected by the Roman occupation, as the legions stationed\r\nthere represented the varied racial stocks of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans abandoned Britain and about 400 A. D., floods of pure\r\nNordics poured into the islands for nearly six centuries, arriving in\r\nthe north as the Norse pirates, who made Scotland Scandinavian, and in\r\nthe east as Saxons and Angles, who founded England.\r\n\r\nThe Angles came from somewhere in central Jutland and the Saxons came\r\nfrom coast lands immediately at the base of the Danish Peninsula. All\r\nthese districts were then and are now almost purely Teutonic; in fact,\r\nthis is part of old Saxony and is to-day the core of Teutonic Germany.\r\n\r\nThese Saxon districts sent out at that time swarms of invaders not only\r\ninto England but into France and over the Alps into Italy, just as at a\r\nmuch later period the same land sent swarming colonies into Hungary and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe same Saxon invaders passed down the Channel coasts and traces of\r\ntheir settlement on the mainland remain to this day in the Cotentin\r\ndistrict around Cherbourg. Scandinavian sea peoples called Danes or\r\nNorthmen swarmed over as late as 900 A. D. and conquered all eastern\r\nEngland. This Danish invasion of England was the same that brought the\r\nNorthmen or Normans into France. In fact the occupation of Normandy was\r\nprobably by Danes and the conquest of England was largely the work of\r\nNorsemen, as Norway at that time was under Danish kings.\r\n\r\nBoth of these invasions, especially the later, swept around the greater\r\nisland and inundated Ireland, driving both the Neolithic aborigines and\r\ntheir Celtic-speaking masters into the bogs and islands of the west.\r\n\r\nThe blond Nordic element to-day is very marked in Ireland as in England.\r\nIt is derived, to some extent, from the early invaders of Celtic speech,\r\nbut the Goidelic element has been very largely absorbed in Ireland as in\r\nwestern England and in Scotland by the Iberian substratum of the\r\npopulation and is found to-day rather in the form of Nordic characters\r\nin brunets than in the entirely blond individuals who represent later\r\nand purer Nordic strains.\r\n\r\nThe figures for recruits taken some decades ago in the two countries\r\nwould indicate that the Irish as a whole are considerably lighter in eye\r\nand darker in hair color than are the English. The combination of black\r\nIberian hair with blue or gray Nordic eyes is frequently found in\r\nIreland and also in Spain and in both these countries is justly admired\r\nfor its beauty, but it is by no means an exclusively Irish type.\r\n\r\nThe tall, blond Irishmen are to-day chiefly Danish with the addition of\r\nEnglish, Norman and Scotch elements, which have poured into the lesser\r\nisland for a thousand years and have imposed the English speech upon it.\r\nThe more primitive and ancient elements in Ireland have always shown\r\ngreat ability to absorb newcomers and during the Middle Ages it was\r\nnotorious that the Norman and English colonists quickly sank to the\r\ncultural level of the natives.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Paleoliths have not been found there some\r\nindications of Paleolithic man appear in Ireland both as single\r\ncharacters and as individuals. Being, like Brittany, situated on the\r\nextreme western outposts of Eurasia, it has more than its share of\r\ngeneralized and low types surviving in the living populations and these\r\ntypes, the Firbolgs, have imparted a distinct and very undesirable\r\naspect to a large portion of the inhabitants of the west and south and\r\nhave greatly lowered the intellectual status of the population as a\r\nwhole. The cross between these elements and the Nordics appears to be a\r\nbad one and the mental and cultural traits of the aborigines have proved\r\nto be exceedingly persistent and appear especially in the unstable\r\ntemperament and the lack of coordinating and reasoning power, so often\r\nfound among the Irish. To the dominance of the Mediterraneans mixed with\r\nPre-Neolithic survivals in the south and west are to be attributed the\r\naloofness of the island from the general trend of European civilization\r\nand its long adherence to ancient forms of religion and even to\r\nPre-Christian superstitions.\r\n\r\nIn England, the same two ethnic elements are present, namely the Nordic\r\nand the Mediterranean. There is, especially in Wales and in the west\r\ncentral counties of England, a large substratum of ancient Mediterranean\r\nblood but the later Nordic elements are everywhere superimposed upon it.\r\n\r\nScotland is by race Anglian in the Lowlands and Norse in the Highlands\r\nwith underlying Goidelic and Brythonic elements, which are exceedingly\r\nhard to identify. The Mediterranean strain is marked in the Highlands\r\nand is frequently associated with tall stature.\r\n\r\nThis brunetness in Scotland is, of course, derived from the same\r\nunderlying Mediterranean stock which we have found elsewhere in the\r\nBritish Islands.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Scotland before the arrival of the Celtic-speaking\r\nNordics seem to have been the Picts, whose language was almost surely\r\nNon-Aryan. Judging from the remnants of Anaryan syntax in the Goidelic\r\nand to a lesser degree in the Cymric languages, Pictish was related to\r\nthe Anaryan Berber tongues still spoken in North Africa. No trace of\r\nthis Pre-Aryan syntax is found in English.\r\n\r\nWhere one race imposes a new language on another, the change is most\r\nmarked in the vocabulary while the ancient usage in syntax or the\r\nconstruction of sentences is the more apt to survive and these ancient\r\nforms often give us a valuable clew to the aboriginal speech. This same\r\nAnaryan syntax is particularly marked in the Irish language, a condition\r\nwhich fits in with the other Pre-Aryan usages and types found there.\r\n\r\nThis divergence between the new vocabulary and the ancient habits of\r\nsyntax is probably one of the causes of the extreme splitting up of the\r\nvarious branches of the Aryan mother tongue.\r\n\r\nWales, like western Ireland, is a museum of racial antiquities and being\r\nan unattractive and poor country has exported men rather than received\r\nimmigration, while such invasions as did arrive came with spent force.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the population of Wales especially in the upland or moorland\r\ndistricts is Mediterranean, with a considerable addition of Paleolithic\r\nremnants. With changing social and industrial conditions these Neolithic\r\nMediterraneans are pushing into the valleys or towns with a resultant\r\nreplacement of the Nordic types.\r\n\r\nRecent and intensive investigations reveal everywhere in Wales distinct\r\nphysical types living side by side or in adjoining villages unchanged\r\nand unchangeable throughout the centuries. Extensive blending has not\r\ntaken place though much crossing has occurred and the persistence of the\r\nskull shape has been particularly marked. Such individuals as are of\r\npure Nordic type are generally members of the old county families and\r\nland owning class.\r\n\r\nAs to language in Wales, the Cymric is everywhere spoken in various\r\ndialects, but there are indications of the ancient underlying Goidelic.\r\nIn fact, Brythonic or Cymric may not have reached Wales much before the\r\nRoman conquest of Britain. The earlier Goidelic survived in parts of\r\nWales as late as the seventh century but by the eleventh century all\r\nconsciousness of race and linguistic distinctions had disappeared in the\r\ncommon name of Cymry. This name should perhaps be limited to the\r\nBrythons of England and not used for their kindred on the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall and along the Welsh border racial types are often grouped in\r\nseparate villages and the intellectual and moral distinctions between\r\nthem are well recognized.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic species of man in its various branches made Gaul the land of\r\nthe Franks and made Britain the land of the Angles and the Englishmen\r\nwho built the British Empire and founded America were of the Nordic and\r\nnot of the Mediterranean type.\r\n\r\nOne of the most vigorous Nordic elements in France, England and America\r\nwas contributed by the Normans and their influence on the development of\r\nthese countries cannot be ignored. The descendants of the Danish and\r\nNorse Vikings who settled in Normandy as Teutonic-speaking heathen and\r\nwho as Normans crossed over to Saxon England and conquered it in 1066\r\nare among the finest and noblest examples of the Nordic race. Their only\r\nrivals in these characters were the early Goths.\r\n\r\nThis Norman strain, while purely Nordic, seems to have been radically\r\ndifferent in its mental makeup, and to some extent in its physical\r\ndetail from the Saxons of England and also from their kindred in\r\nScandinavia.\r\n\r\nThe Normans appear to have been “_fine race_” to use a French idiom and\r\ntheir descendants are often characterized by a tall, slender figure,\r\nmuch less bulky than the typical Teuton, of proud bearing and with\r\nclearly marked features of classic Greek regularity. The type is seldom\r\nextremely blond and is often dark. These Latinized Vikings were and are\r\nanimated by a restless and nomadic energy and by a fierce\r\naggressiveness. They played a brilliant role during the twelfth and\r\nfollowing centuries but later, on the continent, this strain ran out,\r\nthough leaving here and there traces of its former presence, notably in\r\nSicily where the grayish blue Sicilian eye called “the Norman eye” is\r\nstill found among the old noble families.\r\n\r\nThe Norman type is still very common among the English of good family\r\nand especially among hunters, explorers, navigators, adventurers and\r\nofficers in the British army. These latter-day Normans are natural\r\nrulers and administrators and it is to this type that England largely\r\nowes her extraordinary ability to govern justly and firmly the lower\r\nraces. This Norman blood occurs often among the native Americans but\r\nwith the changing social conditions and the filling up of the waste\r\nplaces of the earth it is doomed to a speedy extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Normans were Nordics with a dash of brunet blood and their conquest\r\nof England strengthened the Nordic and not the Mediterranean elements in\r\nthe British Isles, but the connection once established with France\r\nespecially with Aquitaine later introduced from southern France certain\r\nbrunet elements of Mediterranean affinities.\r\n\r\nThe upper class Normans on their arrival in England were probably purely\r\nScandinavian, but in the lower classes there were some dark strains.\r\nThey brought with them large numbers of ecclesiastics who were, for the\r\nmost part drawn from the more ancient types throughout France. Careful\r\ninvestigation of the graveyards and vaults in which these churchmen were\r\nburied revealed a large percentage of round skulls among them.\r\n\r\nIn both Normandy and in the lowlands of Scotland there was much the same\r\nmixture of blood between Scandinavian and Saxon but with a smaller\r\namount of Saxon blood in France. The result in both cases was the\r\nproduction of an extraordinarily forceful race.\r\n\r\nThe Nordics in England are in these days apparently receding before the\r\nNeolithic Mediterranean type. The causes of this decline are the same as\r\nin France and the chief loss is through the wastage of blood by war and\r\nthrough emigration.\r\n\r\nThe typical British soldier is blond or red bearded and the typical\r\nsailor is always a blond. The migrating type from England is also\r\nchiefly Nordic. These facts would indicate that nomadism as well as love\r\nof war and adventure are Nordic characteristics.\r\n\r\nAn extremely potent influence, however, is the transformation of the\r\nnation from an agricultural to a manufacturing community. Heavy,\r\nhealthful work in the fields of northern Europe enables the Nordic type\r\nto thrive, but the cramped factory and crowded city quickly weed him\r\nout, while the little brunet Mediterranean can work a spindle, set type,\r\nsell ribbons or push a clerk’s pen far better than the big, clumsy and\r\nsomewhat heavy Nordic blond, who needs exercise, meat and air and cannot\r\nlive under Ghetto conditions.\r\n\r\nThe increase of urban communities at the expense of the countryside is\r\nalso an important element in the fading of the Nordic type, because the\r\nenergetic countryman of this blood is more apt to improve his fortunes\r\nby moving to the city than the less ambitious Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe country villages and the farms are the nurseries of nations, while\r\ncities are consumers and seldom producers of men. The effort now being\r\nmade in America to settle undesirable immigrants on farms may, from the\r\nviewpoint of race replacement, be more dangerous than allowing them to\r\nremain in crowded Ghettos or tenements.\r\n\r\nIf England has deteriorated and there are those who think they see\r\nindications of such decline, it is due to the lowering proportion of the\r\nNordic blood and the transfer of political power from the vigorous\r\nNordic aristocracy and middle classes to the radical and labor elements,\r\nboth largely recruited from the Mediterranean type.\r\n\r\nOnly in Scandinavia and northwestern Germany does the Nordic race seem\r\nto maintain its full vigor in spite of the enormous wastage of three\r\nthousand years of the swarming forth of its best fighting men. Norway,\r\nhowever, after the Viking outburst has never exhibited military power\r\nand Sweden, in the centuries between the Varangian period and the rise\r\nof Gustavus Adolphus, did not enjoy a reputation for fighting\r\nefficiency. All the three Scandinavian countries after vigorously\r\nattacking Christendom a thousand years ago disappear from history as a\r\nnursery for soldiers until the Reformation when Sweden suddenly\r\nreappears just in time to save Protestantism on the Continent. To-day\r\nall three seem to be intellectually anæmic.\r\n\r\nUpper and Lower Austria, the Tyrol and Styria have a very considerable\r\nNordic element which is in political control but the Alpine races are\r\nslowly replacing the Nordics both there and in Hungary.\r\n\r\nHolland and Flanders are purely Teutonic, the Flemings being the\r\ndescendants of those Franks who did not adopt Latin speech as did their\r\nTeutonic kin across the border in Artois and Picardy; and Holland is the\r\nancient Batavia with the Frisian coast lands eastward to old Saxony.\r\n\r\nDenmark, Norway and Sweden are purely Nordic and yearly contribute\r\nswarms of a splendid type of immigrants to America and are now, as they\r\nhave been for thousands of years, the chief nursery and broodland of the\r\nmaster race.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Norway and in Denmark, there is a substantial number of\r\nshort, dark round heads of Alpine affinities. These dark Norwegians are\r\nregarded as somewhat inferior socially by their Nordic countrymen.\r\nPerhaps as a result of this disability, a disproportionately large\r\nnumber of Norwegian immigrants to America are of this type. Apparently\r\nAmerica is doomed to receive in these later days the least desirable\r\nclasses and types from each European nation now exporting men.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval times the Norse and Danish Vikings sailed not only the\r\nwaters of the known Atlantic, but ventured westward through the fogs and\r\nfrozen seas to Iceland, Greenland and America.\r\n\r\nSweden, after sending forth her Goths and other early Teutonic tribes,\r\nturned her attention to the shores of the eastern Baltic, colonized the\r\ncoast of Finland and the Baltic provinces and supplied also a strong\r\nScandinavian element to the aristocracy of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Finland is as a result Swedish and the natives of the\r\ninterior have distinctly Nordic characters with the exception of the\r\nskull, which in its roundness shows an Alpine cross.\r\n\r\nThe population of the so-called Baltic provinces of Russia is everywhere\r\nNordic and their affinities are with Scandinavia and Germany rather than\r\nwith Slavic Moscovy. The most primitive Aryan languages, namely,\r\nLettish, Lithuanian and the recently extinct Old Prussian, are found in\r\nthis neighborhood and here we are not far from the original Nordic\r\nhomeland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n                         THE NORDIC FATHERLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area in Europe where the Nordic race developed and in which the\r\nAryan languages originated probably included the forest region of\r\neastern Germany, Poland and Russia, together with the grasslands which\r\nstretched from the Ukraine eastward into the steppes south of the Ural.\r\nFrom causes already mentioned this area was long isolated from the rest\r\nof the world and especially from Asia. When the unity of the Aryan race\r\nand of the Aryan language was broken up at the end of the Neolithic and\r\nthe beginning of the Bronze Age, wave after wave of the early Nordics\r\npushed westward along the sandy plains of the north and pressed against\r\nand through the Alpine populations of central Europe. Usually these\r\nearly Nordics, as indeed many of the later ones, constituted only a thin\r\nlayer of ruling classes and there must have been many countries\r\nconquered by them in which we have no historic evidence of their\r\nexistence, linguistic or otherwise. This must have certainly been the\r\ncase in those numerous instances where only the leaders were Nordics and\r\nthe great mass of their followers slaves or serfs of inferior races.\r\n\r\nThe Nordics also swept down through Thrace into Greece and Asia Minor,\r\nwhile other large and important groups entered Asia partly through the\r\nCaucasus Mountains, but in greater strength they migrated around the\r\nnorthern and eastern sides of the Caspian-Aral Sea.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Nordic race which continued to inhabit south Russia\r\nand grazed their flocks of sheep and herds of horses on the grasslands\r\nwere the Scythians of the Greeks and from these nomad shepherds came the\r\nCimmerians, Persians, Sacæ, Massagetæ and perhaps the leaders of the\r\nKassites, Mitanni and other early Aryan-speaking Nordic invaders of\r\nAsia. The descendants of these Nordics are scattered throughout Russia\r\nbut are now submerged by the later Slavs.\r\n\r\nWell marked characters of the Nordic race, which were established in\r\nNeolithic times if not earlier, enable us to distinguish it definitely\r\nwherever it appears in history and we know that all the blondness in the\r\nworld is derived from this source. As blondness is easily observed and\r\nrecorded we are apt to lay too much emphasis on this single character.\r\nThe brown shades of hair are equally Nordic.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nordics first enter the Mediterranean world their arrival is\r\neverywhere marked by a new and higher civilization. In most cases the\r\ncontact of the vigorous barbarians with the ancient civilizations\r\ncreated a sudden impulse of life and an outburst of culture as soon as\r\nthe first destruction wrought by the conquest was repaired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the long continued selection exercised by severe climatic\r\nconditions and the consequent elimination of ineffectives, both of which\r\naffects a race, there is another force at work which concerns the\r\nindividual as well. The energy developed in the north is not lost\r\nimmediately when transferred to the softer conditions of existence in\r\nthe Mediterranean and Indian countries. This energy endures for several\r\ngenerations and only dies away slowly as the northern blood becomes\r\ndiluted and the impulse to strive fades.\r\n\r\nThe contact of Hellene and Pelasgian caused the blossoming of the\r\nancient civilization of Hellas, just as two thousand years later when\r\nthe Nordic invaders of Italy had absorbed the science, art and\r\nliterature of Rome, they produced that splendid century we call the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe chief men of the Cinque Cento and the preceding century were of\r\nNordic blood, largely Gothic and Lombard, which is recognized easily by\r\na close inspection of busts or portraits in northern Italy. Dante,\r\nRaphael, Titian, Michael Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci were all of Nordic\r\ntype, just as in classic times many of the chief men and of the upper\r\nclasses were Nordic.\r\n\r\nSimilar expansions of civilization and organization of empire followed\r\nthe incursion of the Nordic Persians into the land of the round skulled\r\nMedes and the introduction of Sanskrit into India by the Nordic Sacæ who\r\nconquered that peninsula. These outbursts of progress due to the first\r\ncontact and mixture of two contrasted races are, however, only\r\ntransitory and pass with the last lingering trace of Nordic blood.\r\n\r\nIn India the blood of these Aryan-speaking invaders has been absorbed by\r\nthe dark Hindu and in the final event only their synthetic speech\r\nsurvives.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous organization of the Roman state made use of the services\r\nof Nordic mercenaries and kept the Western Empire alive for three\r\ncenturies after the ancient Roman stock had virtually ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe date when the population of the Empire had become predominantly of\r\nMediterranean and Oriental blood, due to the introduction of slaves from\r\nthe east and the wastage of Italian blood in war, coincides with the\r\nestablishment of the Empire under Augustus and the last Republican\r\npatriots represent the final protest of the old patrician Nordic strain.\r\nFor the most part they refused to abdicate their right to rule in favor\r\nof manumitted slaves and imperial favorites and they fell in battle and\r\nsword in hand. The Romans died out but the slaves survived and their\r\ndescendants form the great majority of the south Italians of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of the Republic, Cæsar was the leader of the mob, the\r\nPlebs, which by that time had ceased to be of Roman blood. Pompey’s\r\nparty represented the remnants of the old native Roman aristocracy and\r\nwas defeated at Pharsalia not by Cæsar’s plebeian clients but by his\r\nNordic legionaries from Gaul. Cassius and Brutus were the last\r\nsuccessors of Pompey and their overthrow at Philippi was the final death\r\nblow to the Republican party; with them the native Roman families\r\ndisappear almost entirely.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Romans and for that matter of the native Italians\r\nbegan with the Punic Wars when in addition to the Romans who fell in\r\nbattle a large portion of the country population of Italy was destroyed\r\nby Hannibal. Native Romans suffered greatly in the Social and Servile\r\nWars as well as in the civil conflicts between the factions of Sylla,\r\nwho led the Patricians, and Marius who represented the Plebs. Bloody\r\nproscriptions of the rival parties followed alternately the victory of\r\none side and then of the other and under the tyranny of the Emperors of\r\nthe first century also the old Roman stock was the greatest sufferer\r\nuntil it practically vanished from the scene.\r\n\r\nVoluntary childlessness was the most potent cause of the decline under\r\nthe Empire and when we read of the abject servility of bearers of proud\r\nnames in the days of Nero and Caligula, we must remember that they could\r\nnot rally to their standard followers among the Plebs. They had only the\r\nchoice of submission or suicide and many chose the latter alternative.\r\nThe abjectness of the Roman spirit under the Empire is thus to be\r\nexplained by a change in race.\r\n\r\nWith the expanding dominion of Rome the native elements of vigor were\r\ndrawn year after year into the legions and spent their active years in\r\nwars or in garrisons, while the slaves and those unfit for military duty\r\nstayed home and bred. In the present great war while the native\r\nAmericans are at the front fighting the aliens and immigrants are\r\nallowed to increase without check and the parallel is a close one.\r\n\r\nSlaves began to be imported into Italy in numbers in the second century\r\nB. C. to work the large plantations—latifundia—of the wealthy Romans.\r\nThis importation of slaves and the ultimate extension of the Roman\r\ncitizenship to their manumitted descendants and to inferior races\r\nthroughout the growing Empire and the losses in internal and foreign\r\nwars, ruined the state. In America we find another close parallel in the\r\nCivil War and the subsequent granting of citizenship to Negroes and to\r\never increasing numbers of immigrants of plebeian, servile or Oriental\r\nraces, who throughout history have shown little capacity to create,\r\norganize or even to comprehend Republican institutions.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, when this change in blood was substantially complete, the state\r\ncould no longer be operated under Republican forms of government and the\r\nEmpire arose to take its place. At the beginning the Empire was clothed\r\nin the garb of republicanism in deference to such Roman elements as\r\nstill persisted in the Senate and among the Patricians but ultimately\r\nthese external forms were discarded and the state became virtually a\r\npure despotism.\r\n\r\nThe new population understood little and cared less for the institutions\r\nof the ancient Republic but they were jealous of their own rights of\r\n“Bread and the Circus”—“panem et circenses”—and there began to appear in\r\nplace of the old Roman religion the mystic rites of Eastern countries so\r\nwelcome to the plebeian and uneducated soul. The Emperors to please the\r\nvulgar erected from time to time new shrines to strange gods utterly\r\nunknown to the Romans of the early Republic. In America, also, strange\r\ntemples, which would have been abhorrent to our Colonial ancestors, are\r\nmultiplying and our streets and parks are turned over to monuments to\r\nforeign “patriots,” designed not to please the artistic sense of the\r\npasser-by but to gratify the national preference of some alien element\r\nin the electorate.\r\n\r\nThese comments on the change of race in Rome at the beginning of our era\r\nare not mere speculation. An examination of many thousands of Roman\r\ncolumbaria or funeral urns and the names inscribed thereon show quite\r\nclearly that as early as the first century of our era eighty to ninety\r\nper cent of the urban population of the Roman Empire was of servile\r\nextraction and that about seven-eighths of this slave population was\r\ndrawn from districts within the boundaries of the Empire and very\r\nlargely from the countries bordering on the eastern Mediterranean. Few\r\nnames are found which indicate that their bearers came from Gaul or the\r\ncountries beyond the Alps. These Nordic barbarians were of more use in\r\nthe legions than as household servants.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Christian era the entire Levant and countries\r\nadjoining it in Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt had been so thoroughly\r\nhellenized that many of their inhabitants bore Greek names. It was from\r\nthese countries and from northern Africa that the slave population of\r\nRome was drawn. Their descendants were the most important element in the\r\nRoman melting pot and even to-day form the predominant element in the\r\npopulation of Italy south of the Apennines. When the Nordic barbarians a\r\nfew centuries later poured in, these Romanized Orientals disappeared\r\ntemporarily from view under the rule of the vigorous northerners but\r\nthey have steadily absorbed the latter until the Nordic elements in\r\nItaly now are to be found chiefly in the Lombard plains and the region\r\nof the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine Empire from much the same causes as the Roman became in\r\nits turn gradually less and less European and more and more Oriental\r\nuntil it, too, withered and expired.\r\n\r\nRegarded in the light of the facts the fall of Rome ceases to be a\r\nmystery. The wonder is that the State lived on after the Romans were\r\nextinct and that the Eastern Empire survived so long with an ever fading\r\nGreek population. In Rome and in Greece only the language of the\r\ndominant race survived.\r\n\r\nSo entirely had the blood of the Romans vanished in the last days of the\r\nEmpire that sorry bands of barbarians wandered at will through the\r\ndesolated provinces. Cæsar and his legions would have made short work of\r\nthese unorganized banditti but Cæsar’s legions were a memory, though one\r\ngreat enough to inspire in the intruders somewhat of awe and desire to\r\nimitate. Against invaders, however, brains and brawn are more effective\r\nthan tradition and culture, however noble these last may be.\r\n\r\nEarly ascetic Christianity played a large part in this decline of the\r\nRoman Empire as it was at the outset the religion of the slave, the meek\r\nand the lowly while Stoicism was the religion of the strong men of the\r\ntime. This bias in favor of the weaker elements greatly interfered with\r\ntheir elimination by natural processes and the fighting force of the\r\nEmpire was gradually undermined. Christianity was in sharp contrast to\r\nthe worship of tribal deities which preceded it and it tended then as\r\nnow to break down class and race distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of such distinctions is absolutely essential to race\r\npurity in any community when two or more races live side by side.\r\n\r\nRace feeling may be called prejudice by those whose careers are cramped\r\nby it but it is a natural antipathy which serves to maintain the purity\r\nof type. The unfortunate fact that nearly all species of men interbreed\r\nfreely leaves us no choice in the matter. Races must be kept apart by\r\nartificial devices of this sort or they ultimately amalgamate and in the\r\noffspring the more generalized or lower type prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n                   THE NORDIC RACE OUTSIDE OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find few traces of Nordic characters outside of Europe. When Egypt\r\nwas invaded by the Libyans from the west in 1230 B. C. they were\r\naccompanied by “sea peoples,” probably the Achæan Greeks. There is some\r\nevidence of blondness among the people of the south shore of the\r\nMediterranean down to Greek times and the Tamahu or fair Libyans are\r\nconstantly mentioned in Egyptian records. The reddish blond or partly\r\nblond Berbers found to-day on the northern slopes of the Atlas Mountains\r\nmay well be their descendants. That this blondness of the Berbers,\r\nthough small in amount, is of Nordic origin we may with safety assume,\r\nbut through what channels it came we have no means of knowing. There is\r\nno historic invasion of north Africa by Nordics except the Vandal\r\nconquests but there seems to be little probability that this small\r\nTeutonic tribe left behind any physical trace in the native population.\r\n\r\nThere seem to have been traces of Nordic blood among the Philistines and\r\nstill more among the Amorites. Certain references to the size of the\r\nsons of Anak and to the fairness of David, whose mother was an Amoritish\r\nwoman, point vaguely in this direction.\r\n\r\nReferences in Chinese annals to the green eyes of the Wu-suns or to the\r\nHiung-Nu in central Asia are almost the only evidence we have of the\r\nNordic race in contact with the peoples of eastern Asia, though there\r\nare statements in ancient Chinese or Mongolian records as to the\r\nexistence of blond and tall tribes and nations in those parts of\r\nnorthern Asia where Mongols are now found exclusively. We may expect to\r\nacquire much new light on this subject during the next few decades.\r\n\r\nThe so-called blondness of the hairy Ainus of the northern islands of\r\nJapan seems to be due to a trace of what might be called Proto-Nordic\r\nblood. In hairiness these people are in sharp contrast with their\r\nMongoloid neighbors but this is a generalized character common to the\r\nhighest and the lowest races of man. The primitive Australoids and the\r\nhighly specialized Scandinavians are among the most hairy populations in\r\nthe world. So in the Ainus this somatological peculiarity is merely the\r\nretention of a primitive trait. The occasional brown or greenish eye and\r\nthe sometimes fair complexion of the Ainus are, however, suggestive of\r\nNordic affinities and of an extreme easterly extension of Proto-Nordics\r\nat a very early period.\r\n\r\nThe skull shape of the Ainus is dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic, while\r\nthe broad cheek bones indicate a Mongolian cross as among the Esquimaux.\r\nThe Ainus, like many other small, mysterious peoples, are probably\r\nmerely the remnants of one of the early races that are fast fading into\r\nextinction. The division of man into species and subspecies is very\r\nancient and the chief races of the earth are the successful survivors of\r\na long and fierce competition. Many species, subspecies and races have\r\nvanished utterly, except for reversional characters occasionally found\r\nin the larger races.\r\n\r\nThe only Nordics in Asia Minor, so far as we know, were the Phrygians\r\nwho crossed the Hellespont about 1400 B. C. as part of the same\r\nmigration which brought the Achæans into Greece, the Cimmerians who\r\nentered by the same route and also through the Caucasus about 650 B. C.\r\nand still later, in 270 B. C., the Gauls who, coming from northern Italy\r\nthrough Thrace, founded Galatia. So far as our present information goes\r\nlittle or no trace of these invasions remains in the existing\r\npopulations of Anatolia. The expansions of the Persians and the\r\nAryanization of their empire and the conquests of the Nordics east and\r\nsouth of the Caspian-Aral Sea, will be discussed in connection with the\r\nspread of Aryan languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n                            RACIAL APTITUDES\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the three races, the Alpine, the Mediterranean and the Nordic,\r\nwhich enter into the composition of European populations of to-day and\r\nin various combinations comprise the great bulk of white men all over\r\nthe world. These races vary intellectually and morally just as they do\r\nphysically. Moral, intellectual and spiritual attributes are as\r\npersistent as physical characters and are transmitted substantially\r\nunchanged from generation to generation. These moral and physical\r\ncharacters are not limited to one race but given traits do occur with\r\nmore frequency in one race than in another. Each race differs in the\r\nrelative proportion of what we may term good and bad strains, just as\r\nnations do, or, for that matter, sections and classes of the same\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn considering skull characters we must remember that, while indicative\r\nof independent descent, the size and shape of the head are not closely\r\nrelated to brain power. Aristotle was a Mediterranean if we may trust\r\nthe authenticity of his busts and had a small, long skull, while\r\nHumboldt’s large and characteristically Nordic skull was equally\r\ndolichocephalic. Socrates and Diogenes were apparently quite un-Greek\r\nand represent remnants of some early race, perhaps of Paleolithic man.\r\nThe history of their lives indicates that each was recognized by his\r\nfellow countrymen as in some degree alien, just as the Jews apparently\r\nregarded Christ as, in some indefinite way, non-Jewish.\r\n\r\nMental, spiritual and moral traits are closely associated with the\r\nphysical distinctions among the different European races, although like\r\nsomatological characters, these spiritual attributes have in many cases\r\ngone astray. Enough remain, however, to show that certain races have\r\nspecial aptitudes for certain pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine race is always and everywhere a race of peasants, an\r\nagricultural and never a maritime race. In fact they only extend to salt\r\nwater at the head of the Adriatic and, like all purely agricultural\r\ncommunities throughout Europe, tend toward democracy, although they are\r\nsubmissive to authority both political and religious being usually Roman\r\nCatholics in western Europe. This race is essentially of the soil and in\r\ntowns the type is mediocre and bourgeois.\r\n\r\nThe coastal and seafaring populations of northern Europe are everywhere\r\nNordic as far as the shores of Spain and among Europeans this race is\r\npre-eminently fitted for maritime pursuits. Enterprise at sea during the\r\nMiddle Ages was in the hands of Mediterraneans just as it was originally\r\ndeveloped by Cretans, Phœnicians and Carthaginians but after the\r\nReformation the Nordics seized and occupied this field almost\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nThe Nordics are, all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors,\r\nadventurers and explorers, but above all, of rulers, organizers and\r\naristocrats in sharp contrast to the essentially peasant and democratic\r\ncharacter of the Alpines. The Nordic race is domineering,\r\nindividualistic, self-reliant and jealous of their personal freedom both\r\nin political and religious systems and as a result they are usually\r\nProtestants. Chivalry and knighthood and their still surviving but\r\ngreatly impaired counterparts are peculiarly Nordic traits, and\r\nfeudalism, class distinctions and race pride among Europeans are\r\ntraceable for the most part to the north.\r\n\r\nThe social status of woman varies largely with race but here religion\r\nplays a part. In the Roman Republic and in ancient Germany women were\r\nheld in high esteem. In the Nordic countries of to-day women’s rights\r\nhave received much more recognition than among the southern nations with\r\ntheir traditions of Latin culture. To this general statement modern\r\nGermany is a marked exception. The contrast is great between the mental\r\nattitude toward woman of the ancient Teutons and that of the modern\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nThe pure Nordic peoples are characterized by a greater stability and\r\nsteadiness than are mixed peoples such as the Irish, the ancient Gauls\r\nand the Athenians among all of whom the lack of these qualities was\r\nbalanced by a correspondingly greater versatility.\r\n\r\nThe mental characteristics of the Mediterranean race are well known and\r\nthis race, while inferior in bodily stamina to both the Nordic and the\r\nAlpine, is probably the superior of both, certainly of the Alpines, in\r\nintellectual attainments. In the field of art its superiority to both\r\nthe other European races is unquestioned, although in literature and in\r\nscientific research and discovery the Nordics far excel it.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this interesting subject of the correlation of spiritual\r\nand moral traits with physical characters we may note that these\r\ninfluences are so deeply rooted in everyday consciousness that the\r\nmodern novelist or playwright does not fail to make his hero a tall,\r\nblond, honest and somewhat stupid youth and his villain a small, dark\r\nand exceptionally intelligent individual of warped moral character. So\r\nin Celtic legend as in the Græco-Roman and mediæval romances, prince and\r\nprincess are always fair, a fact rather indicating that the mass of the\r\npeople were brunet at the time when the legends were taking shape. In\r\nfact, “fair” is a synonym for beauty. Most ancient tapestries show a\r\nblond earl on horseback and a dark-haired churl holding the bridle.\r\n\r\nThe gods of Olympus were almost all described as blond, and it would be\r\ndifficult to imagine a Greek artist painting a brunet Venus. In church\r\npictures all angels are blond, while the denizens of the lower regions\r\nrevel in deep brunetness. “Non Angli sed angeli,” remarked Pope Gregory\r\nwhen he first saw Saxon children exposed for sale in the Roman\r\nslave-mart.\r\n\r\nIn depicting the crucifixion no artist hesitates to make the two thieves\r\nbrunet in contrast to the blond Saviour. This is something more than a\r\nconvention, as such quasi-authentic traditions as we have of our Lord\r\nstrongly suggest his Nordic, possibly Greek, physical and moral\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\nThese and similar traditions clearly point to the relations of the one\r\nrace to the other in classic, mediæval and modern times. How far they\r\nmay be modified by democratic institutions and the rule of the majority\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe wars of the past two thousand years in Europe have been almost\r\nexclusively wars between the various nations of this race or between\r\nrulers of Nordic blood.\r\n\r\nFrom a race point of view the present European conflict is essentially a\r\ncivil war and nearly all the officers and a large proportion of the men\r\non both sides are members of this race. It is the same old tragedy of\r\nmutual butchery and mutual destruction between Nordics, just as the\r\nNordic nobility of Renaissance Italy seems to have been possessed with a\r\nblood mania to murder one another. It is the modern edition of the old\r\nBerserker blood rage and is class suicide on a gigantic scale.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war it was difficult to say on which side there\r\nwas the preponderance of Nordic blood. Flanders and northern France are\r\nmore Nordic than south Germany, while the backbone of the armies that\r\nEngland put into the field as well as of those of her colonies was\r\nalmost purely Nordic and a large proportion of the Russian army was of\r\nthe same race. As heretofore stated, with America in the war, the\r\ngreater part of the Nordics of the world are fighting against Germany.\r\n\r\nAlthough the writer has limited carefully the use of the word “Teutonic”\r\nto that section of the Nordic race which originated in Scandinavia and\r\nwhich later spread over northern Europe, nevertheless this term is\r\nunfortunate because it is currently given a national and not a racial\r\nmeaning and is used to denote the populations of the central empires.\r\nThis popular use includes millions who are un-Teutonic and excludes\r\nmillions of pure Teutonic blood who are outside of the political borders\r\nof Austria and Germany and who are bitterly hostile to the very name\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe present inhabitants of the German Empire, to say nothing of Austria,\r\nare only to a limited extent descendants of the ancient Teutonic tribes,\r\nbeing very largely Alpines, especially in the east and south. To abandon\r\nto the Germans and Austrians the exclusive right to the name Teuton or\r\nTeutonic would be to acquiesce in one of their most grandiose\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n                                  ARYA\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown the existence in Europe of three distinct subspecies of man\r\nand a single predominant group of languages called the Aryan or\r\nsynthetic group, it remains to inquire to which of the three races can\r\nbe assigned the honor of inventing, elaborating and introducing this\r\nmost highly developed form of human speech. Our investigations will show\r\nthat the facts point indubitably to an original unity between the Nordic\r\nor rather the Proto-Nordic race and the Proto-Aryan language or the\r\ngeneralized, ancestral, Aryan mother tongue.\r\n\r\nOf the three claimants to the honor of being the original creator of the\r\nAryan group of languages, we can at once dismiss the Mediterranean race.\r\nThe members of this subspecies on the south shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nthe Berbers and the Egyptians, and many peoples in western Asia speak\r\nnow and have always spoken Anaryan tongues. We also know that the speech\r\nof the original Pelasgians was not Aryan, that in Crete remnants of\r\nPre-Aryan speech persisted until about 500 B. C. and that the Hellenic\r\nlanguage was introduced into Ægean countries from the north. In Italy\r\nthe Etruscan in the north and the Messapian in the south were Anaryan\r\nlanguages and the ancestral form of Latin speech in the guise of Umbrian\r\nand Oscan came through the Alps from the countries beyond.\r\n\r\nIn Spain a Celtic language was introduced from the north about 500 B. C.\r\nbut with so little force behind it that it was unable to replace\r\nentirely the Anaryan Basque language of at least a portion of the\r\naborigines.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, Aryan speech was introduced about 800 B. C. and in France\r\nsomewhat earlier. In central and northern Europe no certain trace of the\r\nAnaryan languages at one time spoken there persists, except among the\r\nLapps and in the neighborhood of the Gulf of Finland, where Non-Aryan\r\nFinnic dialects are spoken to-day by the Finlanders and the Esthonians.\r\n\r\nWe thus know the approximate dates of the introduction of Aryan speech\r\ninto western and southern Europe and that it came in through the medium\r\nof the Nordic race.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and in the adjoining parts of France nearly half a million\r\npeople continue to speak an agglutinative language, called Basque or\r\nEuskarian. In skull shape these Basques correspond closely with the\r\nAryan-speaking populations around them, being dolichocephalic in Spain\r\nand brachycephalic or pseudo-brachycephalic in France. In the case of\r\nboth the long skulled and the round skulled Basques the lower part of\r\nthe face is long and thin, with a peculiar and pointed chin and among\r\nthe French Basques the skull is broadened in the temporal region. In\r\nother words, their faces show certain secondary racial characters which\r\nhave been imposed by selection upon a people composed originally of two\r\nraces of independent origin, but long isolated by the limitations of\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe Euskarian language is believed to have been related to the ancient\r\nIberian but has affinities which point to Asia as its place of origin\r\nand make possible the hypothesis that it may have been derived from the\r\nancient language of the Proto-Alpines in the west.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the extinct Ligurian language must be considered in this\r\nconnection. It seems to have been Anaryan, but we do not know whether it\r\nwas the speech originally of Alpines or of Mediterraneans either of whom\r\ncould be reasonably considered as a claimant.\r\n\r\nOther than the Basque language there are in western Europe but few\r\nremains of Pre-Aryan speech, and these are found chiefly in place names\r\nand in a few obscure words.\r\n\r\nRemnants of Anaryan speech exist here and there throughout European\r\nRussia, but many of them can be traced to historic invasions. Until we\r\nreach the main body of Ural-Altaic speech in the east of Russia, the\r\nEsthonians, with kindred tribes of Livonians and Tchouds, and the Finns\r\nare the only peoples who speak Non-Aryan tongues, but the physical type\r\nwith the exception of the skull shape of all these tribes is distinctly\r\nNordic. In this connection the Lapps and related groups in the far north\r\ncan be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Finns is a difficult one. The coast of Finland, of\r\ncourse, is purely Swedish, but the great bulk of the population in the\r\ninterior is brachycephalic, though otherwise thoroughly Nordic in type.\r\n\r\nThe Anaryan Finnish, Esthonian and Livonian languages were probably\r\nintroduced at the same time as were round skulls into Finland. The\r\nshores of the Gulf of Finland were originally inhabited by Nordics and\r\nthe intrusion of round skulled Finns probably came soon after the\r\nChristian era. This immigration and that of the Livonians and Esthonians\r\nmay possibly have been part of the same movement which brought the\r\nAlpine Wends into eastern Germany. The earliest references to the Finns\r\nthat we have locate them in central Russia.\r\n\r\nThe most important Anaryan language in Europe is the Magyar of Hungary,\r\nbut this we know was introduced from the eastward at the end of the\r\nninth century, as was the earlier but now extinct Avar.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans the language of the Turks has never been a vernacular as\r\nit is in Asia Minor. In Europe it was spoken only by the soldiers and\r\nthe civil administrators and by very sparse colonies of Turkish\r\nsettlers. The mania of the Turks for white women, which is said to have\r\nbeen one of the motives that led to the conquest of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire, has unconsciously resulted in the obliteration of the Mongoloid\r\ntype of the original Asiatic invaders. Persistent crossing with\r\nCircassian and Georgian women, as well as with slaves of every race in\r\nAsia Minor and in Europe with whom they came in contact, has made the\r\nEuropean Turk of to-day indistinguishable in physical characters from\r\nhis Christian neighbors. At the same time, polygamy has greatly\r\nstrengthened the hold of the dominant Turk. In fact, among the upper\r\nclasses of the higher races monogamy and the resultant limitation in\r\nnumber of offspring has been a source of weakness from the viewpoint of\r\nrace expansion. The Turks of Seljukian and Osmanli origin were never\r\nnumerous and the Sultan’s armies were largely composed of Islamized\r\nAnatolians and Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn Persia and India, also, the Aryan languages were introduced from the\r\nnorth at known periods, so in view of all these facts the Mediterranean\r\nrace cannot claim the honor of either the invention or dissemination of\r\nthe synthetic languages.\r\n\r\nThe chief claim of the Alpine race of central Europe and western Asia to\r\nthe invention and introduction into Europe of the Proto-Aryan form of\r\nspeech rests on the fact that nearly all the members of this race in\r\nEurope speak well developed Aryan languages, chiefly in some form of\r\nSlavic. This fact taken by itself may have no more significance than the\r\nfact that the Mediterranean race in Spain, Italy and France speaks\r\nRomance languages, but it is, nevertheless, an argument of some weight.\r\n\r\nOutside of Europe the Armenians and other Armenoid brachycephalic\r\npeoples of Asia Minor and the Iranian Highlands, all of Alpine race,\r\ntogether with a few isolated tribes of the Caucasus, speak Aryan\r\nlanguages and these peoples lie on the highroad along which knowledge of\r\nthe metals and other cultural developments entered Europe.\r\n\r\nIf the Aryan language were invented and developed by these Armenoid\r\nAlpines we should be obliged to assume that they introduced it along\r\nwith bronze culture into Europe about 3000 B. C. and taught the Nordics\r\nboth their language and their metal culture. There are, however, in\r\nwestern Asia many Alpine peoples who do not speak Aryan languages and\r\nyet are Alpine in type, such as the Turcomans and in Asia Minor the\r\nso-called Turks are also largely Islamized Alpines of the Armenoid\r\nsubspecies who speak Turki. There is no trace of Aryan speech south of\r\nthe Caucasus until after 1700 B. C. and the Hittite language spoken\r\nbefore that date in central and eastern Asia Minor, although not yet\r\nclearly deciphered, was Anaryan to the best of our present knowledge.\r\nThe Hittites themselves were probably ancestral to the living Armenians.\r\n\r\nWe are sufficiently acquainted with the languages of the ancient\r\nMesopotamian countries to know that the speech of Accad and Sumer, of\r\nSusa and Media was agglutinative and that the languages of Assyria and\r\nof Palestine were Semitic. The speech of the Kassites was Anaryan, but\r\nthey seem to have been in contact with the horse-using Nordics and some\r\nof their leaders bore Aryan names. The language of the shortlived empire\r\nof the Mitanni in the foothills south of Armenia is the only one about\r\nthe character of which there can be serious doubt. There is, therefore,\r\nmuch negative evidence against the existence of Aryan speech in that\r\npart of the world earlier than its known introduction by Nordics.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the last great expansion into Europe of the Alpine race\r\nbrought from Asia the Aryan mother tongue, as well as the knowledge of\r\nmetals, we must assume that all the members of the Nordic race thereupon\r\nadopted synthetic speech from the Alpines.\r\n\r\nWe know that these Alpines reached Britain about 1800 B. C. and probably\r\nthey had previously occupied much of Gaul, so that if they are to be\r\ncredited with the introduction of the synthetic languages into western\r\nEurope, it is difficult to understand why we have no known trace of any\r\nform of Aryan speech in central Europe or west of the Rhine prior to\r\n1000 B. C. while we have some, though scanty, evidence of Non-Aryan\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in favor of this claim of the Alpine race to be the\r\noriginal inventor of synthetic speech, that language is ever a measure\r\nof culture and the higher forms of civilization are greatly hampered by\r\nthe limitations of speech imposed by the less highly evolved languages,\r\nnamely, the monosyllabic and the agglutinative, which include nearly all\r\nthe Non-Aryan languages of the world. It does not seem probable that\r\nbarbarians, however fine in physical type and however well endowed with\r\nthe potentiality of intellectual and moral development, dwelling as\r\nhunters in the bleak and barren north along the edge of the retreating\r\nglaciers and as nomad shepherds in the Russian grasslands, could have\r\nevolved a more complicated and higher form of articulate speech than the\r\ninhabitants of southwestern Asia, who many thousand years earlier were\r\nhighly civilized and are known to have invented the arts of agriculture,\r\nmetal working and domestication of animals, as well as of writing and\r\npottery. Nevertheless, such seems to be the fact.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it appears that a study of the Mediterranean race shows\r\nthat so far from being purely European, it is equally African and\r\nAsiatic and that in the narrow coastal fringe of southern Persia, in\r\nIndia and even farther east the last strains of this race gradually fade\r\ninto the Negroids through prolonged cross breeding. A similar inquiry\r\ninto the origin and distribution of the Alpine subspecies shows clearly\r\nthe fundamentally Asiatic origin of the type and that on its easternmost\r\nborders in central Asia it marches with the round skulled Mongols, and\r\nthat neither the one nor the other was the inventor of Aryan speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n                     ORIGIN OF THE ARYAN LANGUAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the process of elimination set forth in the preceding chapter we are\r\ncompeted to acknowledge that the strongest claimant for the honor of\r\nbeing the race of the original Aryans, is the tall, blond Nordic. An\r\nanalysis of the various languages of the Aryan group reveals an extreme\r\ndiversity which can be best explained by the hypothesis that the\r\nexisting languages are now spoken by people upon whom Aryan speech has\r\nbeen forced from without. This theory corresponds exactly with the known\r\nhistoric fact that the Aryan languages, during the last three or four\r\nthousand years at least have, again and again, been imposed by Nordics\r\nupon populations of Alpine and Mediterranean blood.\r\n\r\nWithin the present distributional area of the Nordic race on the Gulf of\r\nRiga and in the very middle of a typical area of isolation, are the most\r\ngeneralized members of the Aryan group, namely Lettish and Lithuanian,\r\nboth almost Proto-Aryan in character. Close at hand existed the closely\r\nrelated Old Prussian or Borussian, very recently extinct. These archaic\r\nlanguages are relatively close to Sanskrit and exist in actual contact\r\nwith the Anaryan speech of the Esthonians and Finns.\r\n\r\nThe Anaryan languages in eastern Russia are Ugrian, a form of speech\r\nwhich extends far into Asia and which appears to contain elements which\r\nunite it with synthetic speech and may be dimly transitory in character.\r\nIn the opinion of many philologists, a primitive form of Ugrian might\r\nhave given birth to the Proto-Aryan ancestor of existing synthetic\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis, if sustained by further study, will provide additional\r\nevidence that the site of the development of the Aryan languages and of\r\nthe Nordic subspecies was in eastern Europe, in a region which is close\r\nto the meeting place between the most archaic synthetic languages and\r\nthe most nearly related Anaryan tongue, the agglutinative Ugrian.\r\n\r\nThe Aryan tongue was introduced into Greece by the Achæans about 1400 B.\r\nC. and later, about 1100 B. C. by the true Hellenes, who brought in the\r\nclassic dialects of Dorian, Ionian and Æolian.\r\n\r\nThese Aryan languages superseded their Anaryan predecessor, the\r\nPelasgian. From the language of these early invaders came the Illyrian,\r\nThracian, Albanian, classic Greek and the debased modern Romaic, a\r\ndescendant of the Ionian dialect.\r\n\r\nAryan speech was introduced among the Anaryan-speaking Etruscans of the\r\nItalian Peninsula by the Umbrians and Oscans about 1100 B. C. and from\r\nthe language of these conquerors was derived Latin which later spread to\r\nthe uttermost confines of the Roman Empire. Its descendants to-day are\r\nthe Romance tongues spoken within the ancient imperial boundaries,\r\nPortuguese on the west, Castilian, Catalan, Provençal, French, the\r\nLangue d’oïl of the Walloons, Romansch, Ladin, Friulian, Tuscan,\r\nCalabrian and Rumanian.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the existence of a language clearly descended from Latin,\r\nthe Rumanian, in the eastern Carpathians cut off by Slavic and Magyar\r\ntongues from the nearest Romance tongues presents difficulties. The\r\nRumanians themselves make two claims; the first, which can be safely\r\ndisregarded, is an unbroken linguistic descent from a group of Aryan\r\nlanguages which occupied this whole section of Europe, from which Latin\r\nwas derived and of which Albanian is also a remnant.\r\n\r\nThe more serious claim, however, made by the Rumanians is to linguistic\r\nand racial descent from the military colonists planted by the Emperor\r\nTrajan in the great Dacian plain north of the Danube. This may be\r\npossible, so far as the language is concerned, but there are some\r\nweighty objections to it.\r\n\r\nWe have little evidence for, and much against, the existence of Rumanian\r\nspeech north of the Danube for nearly a thousand years after Rome\r\nabandoned this outlying region. Dacia was one of the last provinces to\r\nbe occupied by Rome and was the first from which the legions were\r\nwithdrawn upon the decline of the Empire. The northern Carpathians,\r\nfurthermore, where the Rumanians claim to have taken refuge during the\r\nbarbarian invasions formed part of the Slavic homeland and it was in\r\nthese same mountains and in the Ruthenian districts of eastern Galicia\r\nthat the Slavic languages were developed, probably by the Sarmatians and\r\nVenethi, from whence they spread in all directions in the centuries that\r\nimmediately followed the fall of Rome. So it is almost impossible to\r\ncredit the survival of a frontier community of Romanized natives\r\nsituated not only in the path of the great invasions of Europe from the\r\neast, but also in the very spot where Slavic tongues were at the time\r\nevolving.\r\n\r\nRumanian speech occupies large areas outside of the present kingdom of\r\nRumania, in Russian Bessarabia, Austrian Bukowina and above all in\r\nHungarian Transylvania.\r\n\r\nThe linguistic problem is further complicated by the existence in the\r\nPindus Mountains of Thessaly of another large community of Vlachs of\r\nRumanian speech. How this later community could have survived from Roman\r\ntimes until to-day, untouched either by the Greek language of the\r\nByzantine Empire or by the Turkish conquest is another difficult\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, on the whole, points to the descent of the Vlachs from the\r\nearly inhabitants of Thrace, who adopted Latin speech in the first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era and clung to it during the domination of\r\nthe Bulgarians from the seventh century onward in the lands south of the\r\nDanube. In the thirteenth century the mass of these Vlachs, leaving\r\nscattered remnants behind them, crossed the Danube and founded Little\r\nand Great Wallachia. From there they spread into Transylvania and a\r\ncentury later into Moldavia.\r\n\r\nThe solution of this problem receives no assistance from anthropology,\r\nas these Rumanian-speaking populations both on the Danube and in the\r\nPindus Mountains in no way differ physically from their neighbors on all\r\nsides. But through whatever channel they acquired their Latin speech the\r\nRumanians of to-day can lay no valid claim to blood descent even in a\r\nremote degree from the true Romans.\r\n\r\nThe first Aryan languages known in western Europe were the Celtic group\r\nwhich first appears west of the Rhine about 1000 B. C.\r\n\r\nOnly a few dim traces of Pre-Aryan speech have been found in the British\r\nIsles, and these largely in place names. The Pre-Aryan language of the\r\nPre-Nordic population of Britain may have survived down to historic\r\ntimes as Pictish.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, Celtic speech was introduced in two successive waves, first\r\nby the Goidels or “Q” Celts, who apparently appeared about 800 B. C. and\r\nthis form exists to this day as Erse in western Ireland, as Manx of the\r\nIsle of Man and as Gaelic in the Scottish Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe Goidels were still in a state of bronze culture. When they reached\r\nBritain they must have found there a population preponderantly of\r\nMediterranean type with numerous remains of still earlier races of\r\nPaleolithic times and also some round skulled Alpines of the Round\r\nBarrows, who have since largely faded from the living population. When\r\nthe next invasion, the Cymric or Brythonic, occurred the Goidels had\r\nbeen absorbed very largely by the underlying Mediterranean aborigines\r\nwho had meanwhile accepted the Goidelic form of Celtic speech, just as\r\non the continent the Gauls had mixed with Alpine and Mediterranean\r\nnatives and had imposed upon the conquered their own tongue. In fact, in\r\nBritain, Gaul and Spain the Goidels and Gauls were chiefly a ruling,\r\nmilitary class, while the great bulk of the population remained\r\nunchanged although Aryanized in speech.\r\n\r\nThese Brythonic or Cymric tribes or “P” Celts followed the “Q” Celts\r\nfour or five hundred years later, and drove the Goidels westward through\r\nGermany, Gaul and Britain and this movement of population was still\r\ngoing on when Cæsar crossed the Channel. The Brythonic group gave rise\r\nto the modern Cornish, extinct within a century, the Cymric of Wales and\r\nthe Armorican of Brittany.\r\n\r\nIn central Europe we find traces of these same two forms of Celtic\r\nspeech with the Goidelic everywhere the older and the Cymric the more\r\nrecent arrival. The cleavage between the dialects of the “Q” Celts and\r\nthe “P” Celts was probably less marked two thousand years ago than at\r\npresent, since in their modern form they are both Neo-Celtic languages.\r\nWhat vestiges of Celtic languages remain in France belong to Brythonic.\r\nCeltic was not generally spoken in Aquitaine in Cæsar’s time.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Celtic-speaking races came into conflict in Britain their\r\noriginal relationship had been greatly obscured by the crossing of the\r\nGoidels with the underlying dark Mediterranean race of Neolithic culture\r\nand by the mixture of the Belgæ with Teutonic tribes. The result was\r\nthat the Brythons did not distinguish between the blond Goidels and the\r\nbrunet but Celticized Mediterraneans as they all spoke Goidelic\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\nIn the same way when the Saxons and the Angles entered Britain they\r\nfound there a population speaking Celtic of some form, either Goidelic\r\nor Cymric and promptly called them all Welsh (foreigners). These Welsh\r\nwere preponderantly of Mediterranean type with some mixture of a blond\r\nGoidel strain and a much stronger blond strain of Cymric origin and\r\nthese same elements exist to-day in England. The Mediterranean race is\r\neasily distinguished, but the physical types derived from Goidel and\r\nBrython alike are merged and lost in the later floods of pure Nordic\r\nblood, Angle, Saxon, Dane, Norse and Norman. In this primitive, dark\r\npopulation with successive layers of blond Nordics imposed upon it, each\r\none more purely Nordic and in the relative absence of round heads lie\r\nthe secret and the solution of the anthropology of the British Isles.\r\nThis Iberian substratum was able to absorb to a large extent the earlier\r\nCeltic-speaking invaders, both Goidels and Brythons, but it is only just\r\nbeginning to seriously threaten the later Nordics and to reassert its\r\nancient brunet characters after three thousand years of submergence.\r\n\r\nIn northwest Scotland there is a Gaelic-speaking area where the place\r\nnames are all Scandinavian and the physical types purely Nordic. This is\r\nthe only spot in the British Isles where Celtic speech has reconquered a\r\ndistrict from the Teutonic languages and it was the site of one of the\r\nconquests of the Norse Vikings, probably in the early centuries of the\r\nChristian era. In Caithness in north Scotland, as well as in some\r\nisolated spots on the Irish coasts, the language of these same Norse\r\npirates persisted within a century. In the fifth century of our era and\r\nafter the break-up of Roman domination in Britain there was much racial\r\nunrest and a back wave of Goidels crossed from Ireland and either\r\nreintroduced or reinforced the Gaelic speech in the highlands. Later,\r\nGoidelic speech was gradually driven northward and westward by the\r\nintrusive English of the lowlands and was ultimately forced over this\r\noriginally Norse-speaking area. We have elsewhere in Europe evidence of\r\nsimilar shiftings of speech without any corresponding change in the\r\nblood of the population.\r\n\r\nExcept in the British Isles and in Brittany Celtic languages have left\r\nno modern descendants, but have everywhere been replaced by languages of\r\nNeo-Latin or of Teutonic origin. Outside of Brittany one of the last, if\r\nnot quite the last, reference to Celtic speech in Gaul is the historic\r\nstatement that “Celtic” tribes, as well as “Armoricans,” took part at\r\nChâlons in the great victory in 451 A. D. over Attila the Hun and his\r\nconfederacy of subject nations.\r\n\r\nOn the continent the only existing populations of Celtic speech are the\r\nprimitive inhabitants of central Brittany, a population noted for their\r\nreligious fanaticism and for other characteristics of a backward people.\r\nThis Celtic speech is claimed to have been introduced about 450–500 A.\r\nD. by Britons fleeing from the Saxons. These refugees, if there were any\r\nsubstantial number of them, must have been dolichocephs of either\r\nMediterranean or Nordic race or both. We are asked by this tradition to\r\nbelieve that their long skull was lost, but that their language was\r\nadopted by the round skulled Alpine population of Armorica. It is much\r\nmore probable that the Cymric-speaking Alpines of Brittany have merely\r\nretained in this isolated corner of France a form of Celtic speech which\r\nwas prevalent throughout northern Gaul and Britain before these\r\nprovinces were conquered by Rome and Latinized and which, perhaps, was\r\nreinforced later by British Cymry. Cæsar remarked that there was little\r\ndifference between the speech of the Belgæ in northern Gaul and in\r\nBritain. In both cases the speech was Cymric.\r\n\r\nLong after the conquest of Gaul by the Goths and Franks Teutonic speech\r\nremained predominant among the ruling classes and, by the time it\r\nsuccumbed to the Latin tongue of the Romanized natives, the old Celtic\r\nlanguages had been entirely forgotten outside of Brittany.\r\n\r\nAn example of similar changes of language is to be found in Normandy\r\nwhere the country was inhabited by the Nordic Belgæ speaking a Cymric\r\nlanguage before that tongue was replaced by Latin. This coast was\r\nravaged about 300 or 400 A. D. by Saxons who formed settlements along\r\nboth sides of the Channel and the coasts of Brittany which were later\r\nknown as the Litus Saxonicum. Their progress can best be traced by place\r\nnames as our historic record of these raids is scanty.\r\n\r\nThe Normans landed in Normandy in the year 911 A. D. They were heathen,\r\nDanish barbarians, speaking a Teutonic tongue. The religion, culture and\r\nlanguage of the old Romanized populations worked a miracle in the\r\ntransformation of everything except blood in one short century. So quick\r\nwas the change that 155 years later the descendants of the same Normans\r\nlanded in England as Christian Frenchmen armed with all the culture of\r\ntheir period. The change was startling, but the Norman blood remained\r\nunchanged and entered England as a substantially Nordic type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n                       THE ARYAN LANGUAGE IN ASIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ægean region and south of the Caucasus Nordics appear after 1700\r\nB. C. but there were unquestionably invasions and raids from the north\r\nfor many centuries previous to our first records. These early migrations\r\nwere probably not in sufficient force to modify the blood of the\r\nautochthonous races or to substitute Aryan languages for the ancient\r\nMediterranean and Asiatic tongues.\r\n\r\nThese men of the North came from the grasslands of Russia in successive\r\nwaves and among the first of whom we have fairly clear knowledge were\r\nthe Achæans and Phrygians. Aryan names are mentioned in the dim\r\nchronicles of the Mesopotamian empires about 1700 B. C. among the\r\nKassites and later, Mitanni. Aryan names of prisoners captured beyond\r\nthe mountains in the north and of Aryan deities before whom oaths were\r\ntaken are recorded about 1400 B. C. but one of the first definite\r\naccounts of Nordics south of the Caucasus describes the presence of\r\nNordic Persians at Lake Urmia about 900 B. C. There were many incursions\r\nfrom that time on, the Cimmerians raiding across the Caucasus as early\r\nas 650 B. C. and shortly afterward overrunning all Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe easterly extension of the Russian steppes or Kiptchak north of the\r\nCaspian-Aral Sea in Turkestan as far as the foothills of the Pamirs was\r\noccupied by the Sacæ or Massagetæ, who were also Nordics and akin to the\r\nCimmerians and Persians, as were, perhaps, the Ephtalites or White Huns\r\nin Sogdiana north of Persia, destroyed by the Turks in the sixth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFor several centuries groups of Nordics drifted as nomad shepherds\r\nacross the Caucasus into the empire of the Medes, introducing little by\r\nlittle the Aryan tongue which later developed into Old Persian. By 550\r\nB. C. these Persians had become sufficiently numerous to overthrow their\r\nrulers and under the leadership of the great Cyrus they organized the\r\nPersian Empire, one of the most enduring of Oriental states. The base of\r\nthe population of the Persian Empire rested on the round skulled Medes\r\nwho belonged to the Armenoid subdivision of the Alpines. Under the\r\nleadership of their priestly caste of Magi these Medes rebelled again\r\nand again against their Nordic masters before the two peoples became\r\nfused.\r\n\r\nFrom 525 to 485 B. C. during the reign of Darius, whose sculptured\r\nportraits show a man of pure Nordic type, the tall, blond Persians had\r\nbecome almost exclusively a class of great ruling nobles and had\r\nforgotten the simplicity of their shepherd ancestors. Their language\r\nbelonged to the Eastern or Iranian division of Aryan speech and was\r\nknown as Old Persian, which continued to be spoken until the fourth\r\ncentury before the Christian era. From it were derived Pehlevi, or\r\nParthian as well as modern Persian. The great book of the old Persians,\r\nthe Avesta, which was written in Zendic, also an Iranian language, does\r\nnot go back to the reign of Darius and was remodelled after the\r\nChristian era, but the Old Persian of Darius was closely related to the\r\nZendic of Bactria and to the Sanskrit of Hindustan. From Zendic, also\r\ncalled Medic, are derived Ghalcha, Balochi, Kurdish and other dialects.\r\n\r\nThe rise to imperial power of the dolichocephalic Aryan-speaking\r\nPersians was largely due to the genius of their leaders but the\r\nAryanization of western Asia by them is one of the most amazing events\r\nin history. The whole region became completely transformed so far as the\r\nacceptance by the conquered of the language and religion of the Persians\r\nwas concerned, but the blood of the Nordic race quickly became diluted\r\nand a few centuries later disappears from history.\r\n\r\nDuring the great wars with Greece the pure Persian blood was still\r\nunimpaired and in control. In the literature of the time there is little\r\nevidence of race antagonism between the Greek and the Persian leaders\r\nalthough their rival cultures were sharply contrasted. In the time of\r\nAlexander the Great the pure Persian blood was obviously confined to the\r\nnobles and it was the policy of Alexander to Hellenize the Persians and\r\nto amalgamate his Greeks with them. The amount of pure Macedonian blood\r\nwas not sufficient to reinforce the Nordic strain of the Persians and\r\nthe net result was the entire loss of the Greek stock.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether the Armenians of Asia Minor derived their Aryan\r\nspeech from this invasion of the Nordic Persians, or whether they\r\nreceived it at an earlier date from the Phrygians and from the west.\r\nThese Phrygians entered Asia Minor by way of the Dardanelles and broke\r\nup the Hittite Empire. Their language was Aryan and probably was related\r\nto Thracian. In favor of the theory of the introduction of the Armenian\r\nlanguage by the Phrygians from the west, rather than by the Persians\r\nfrom the east, is the highly significant fact that the basic structure\r\nof that tongue shows its relationship to be with the western or Centum\r\nrather than with the eastern or Satem group of Aryan languages and this,\r\ntoo, in spite of a very large Persian vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians themselves, like all the other natives of the plateaux and\r\nhighlands as far east as the Hindu Kush Mountains, while of Aryan\r\nspeech, are of the Armenoid subdivision, in sharp contrast to the\r\npredominant types south of the mountains in Persia, Afghanistan and\r\nHindustan, all of which are dolichocephalic and of Mediterranean\r\naffinity but generally betraying traces of admixture with still more\r\nancient races of Negroid origin, especially in India.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last and easternmost extension of Aryan languages in\r\nAsia. As mentioned above, the grasslands and steppes of Russia extend\r\nnorth of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian Sea to ancient Bactria,\r\nnow Turkestan. This whole country was occupied by the Nordic Sacæ and\r\nthe closely related Massagetæ. These Sacæ may be identical with the\r\nlater Scythians.\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of the second millennium B. C. and perhaps even\r\nearlier, the first Nordics crossed over the Afghan passes, entered the\r\nplains of India and organized a state in the Punjab, “the land of the\r\nfive rivers,” bringing with them Aryan speech to a population probably\r\nof Mediterranean type and represented to-day by the Dravidians. The\r\nNordic Sacæ arrived later in India and introduced the Vedas, religious\r\npoems, which were at first transmitted orally but which were reduced to\r\nwritten form in Old Sanskrit by the Brahmans at the comparatively late\r\ndate of 300 A. D. From this classic Sanskrit are derived all the modern\r\nAryan languages of Hindustan, as well as the Singalese of Ceylon and the\r\nchief dialects of Assam.\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity among scholars as to the date of the first\r\nentry of these Aryan-speaking tribes into the Punjab but the consensus\r\nof opinion seems to indicate a period between 1600 and 1700 B. C. or\r\neven somewhat earlier. However, the very close affinity of Sanskrit to\r\nthe Old Persian of Darius and to the Zendavesta would strongly indicate\r\nthat the final introduction of Aryan languages in the form of Sanskrit\r\noccurred at a much later time. The most recent tendency is to bring\r\nthese dates somewhat forward.\r\n\r\nIf close relationship between languages indicates correlation in time\r\nthen the entry of the Sacæ into India would appear to have been nearly\r\nsimultaneous with the crossing of the Caucasus by the Nordic Cimmerians\r\nand their Persian successors.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the Zendavesta and the Sanskrit Vedas is as\r\nnear as that between High and Low German and consequently such close\r\naffinity prevents our thrusting back the date of the separation of the\r\nPersians and the Sacæ more than a few centuries.\r\n\r\nA simultaneous migration of nomad shepherds on both sides of the\r\nCaspian-Aral Sea would naturally occur in a general movement southward\r\nand such migrations may have taken place several times. In all\r\nprobability these Nordic invasions occurred one after another for a\r\nthousand years or more, the later ones obscuring and blurring the memory\r\nof their predecessors.\r\n\r\nWhen shepherd tribes leave their grasslands and attack their\r\nagricultural neighbors, the reason is nearly always a famine due to\r\nprolonged drought and causes such as these have again and again in\r\nhistory put the nomad tribes in motion over large areas. During many\r\ncenturies fresh tribes composed of Nordics or under the leadership of\r\nNordics but all Aryan-speaking, poured over the Afghan passes from the\r\nnorthwest and pushed before them the earlier arrivals. Clear traces of\r\nthese successive floods of conquerors are to be found in the Vedas\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Zendic form of the Iranian group of Aryan languages was spoken by\r\nthose Sacæ who remained in old Bactria and from it is derived a whole\r\ngroup of closely related dialects still used in the Pamirs of which\r\nGhalcha is the best known.\r\n\r\nThe Sacæ and Massagetæ were, like the Persians, tall, blond dolichocephs\r\nand they have left behind them dim traces of their blood among the\r\nliving Mongolized nomads of Turkestan, the Kirghizes. Ancient Bactria\r\nmaintained its Nordic and Aryan aspect long after Alexander’s time and\r\ndid not become Mongolized and receive the sinister name of Turkestan\r\nuntil the seventh century, when it was the first victim of the series of\r\nferocious invasions from the north and east, which under various Mongol\r\nleaders destroyed civilization in Asia and threatened its existence in\r\nEurope. These conquests culminated in 1241 A. D. at Wahlstatt in Silesia\r\nwhere the Germans, though themselves badly defeated, put a final limit\r\nto this westward rush of Asiatics.\r\n\r\nThe Sacæ were the most easterly members of the Nordic race of whom we\r\nhave definite record. The Chinese knew well these “green eyed devils,”\r\nwhom they called by their Tatar name, the “Wu-suns,”—the tall ones—and\r\nwith whom they came into contact about 200 B. C. in what is now Chinese\r\nTurkestan. Other Nordic tribes are recorded in this region. Evidence is\r\naccumulating that central Asia had a large Nordic population in the\r\ncenturies preceding the Christian era. The discovery of the Aryan\r\nTokharian language in Chinese Turkestan considered in connection with\r\nother facts indicates intensive occupation by Nordics of territories in\r\ncentral Asia now wholly Mongol, just as in Europe dark-haired Alpines\r\noccupy large territories where in Roman times fair-haired Nordics were\r\npreponderant. In short we find both in Europe and in western and central\r\nAsia the same record of Nordic decline during the last two thousand\r\nyears and their replacement by races of inferior value and civilization.\r\n\r\nThis Tokharian is undoubtedly a pure Aryan language related, curiously\r\nenough, to the western group rather than to the Indo-Iranian. It has\r\nbeen deciphered from inscriptions recently found in northeast Turkestan\r\nand was a living language prior to the ninth century A. D.\r\n\r\nOf all the wonderful conquests of the Sacæ there remain as evidence of\r\ntheir invasions only these Indian and Afghan languages. Dim traces of\r\ntheir blood have been found in the Pamirs and in Afghanistan, but in the\r\nsouth their blond traits have vanished, even from the Punjab. It may be\r\nthat the stature of some of the Afghan hill tribes and of the Sikhs and\r\nsome of the facial characters of the latter are derived from this\r\nsource, but all blondness of skin, hair or eye of the original Sacæ has\r\nutterly vanished.\r\n\r\nThe long skulls all through India are to be attributed to the\r\nMediterranean race rather than to this Nordic invasion, while the\r\nPre-Dravidians and Negroids of south India, with which the former are\r\nlargely mixed, are also dolichocephs.\r\n\r\nIn short, the introduction in Iran and India of Aryan languages,\r\nIranian, Ghalchic and Sanskrit, represents a linguistic and not an\r\nethnic conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn concluding this revision of the racial foundations upon which the\r\nhistory of Europe has been based it is scarcely necessary to point out\r\nthat the actual results of the spectacular conquests and invasions of\r\nhistory have been far less permanent than those of the more insidious\r\nvictories arising from the crossing of two diverse races and that in\r\nsuch mixtures the relative prepotency of the various human subspecies in\r\nEurope appears to be in inverse ratio to their social value.\r\n\r\nThe continuity of physical traits and the limitation of the effects of\r\nenvironment to the individual only are now so thoroughly recognized by\r\nscientists that it is at most a question of time when the social\r\nconsequences which result from such crossings will be generally\r\nunderstood by the public at large. As soon as the true bearing and\r\nimport of the facts are appreciated by lawmakers a complete change in\r\nour political structure will inevitably occur and our present reliance\r\non the influence of education will be superseded by a readjustment based\r\non racial values.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the extreme antiquity of physical and spiritual\r\ncharacters and the persistency with which they outlive those elements of\r\nenvironment termed language, nationality and forms of government, we\r\nmust consider the relation of these facts to the development of the race\r\nin America. We may be certain that the progress of evolution is in full\r\noperation to-day under those laws of nature which control it and that\r\nthe only sure guide to the future lies in the study of the operation of\r\nthese laws in the past.\r\n\r\nWe Americans must realize that the altruistic ideals which have\r\ncontrolled our social development during the past century and the\r\nmaudlin sentimentalism that has made America “an asylum for the\r\noppressed,” are sweeping the nation toward a racial abyss. If the\r\nMelting Pot is allowed to boil without control and we continue to follow\r\nour national motto and deliberately blind ourselves to all “distinctions\r\nof race, creed or color,” the type of native American of Colonial\r\ndescent will become as extinct as the Athenian of the age of Pericles,\r\nand the Viking of the days of Rollo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maps shown facing pages 266, 268, 270, and 272 of this book attempt\r\nin broad and somewhat hypothetical lines to represent by means of color\r\ndiagrams the original distribution and the subsequent expansion and\r\nmigration of the three main European races, the Mediterranean, the\r\nAlpine and the Nordic, as outlined in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE MAXIMUM EXPANSION OF THE ALPINES WITH BRONZE CULTURE, 3000–1800 B.\r\n                                   C.\r\n\r\nThe first map (Pl. I) shows the distribution of these races at the close\r\nof the Neolithic, as well as their later expansion. It also indicates\r\nthe sites of earlier cultures. The distribution of megaliths in Asia\r\nMinor on the north coast of Africa and up the Atlantic seaboard through\r\nSpain, France and Britain to Scandinavia is set forth. These great stone\r\nmonuments were seemingly the work of the Mediterranean race using,\r\nhowever, a culture of bronze acquired from the Alpines. The map also\r\nshows the sites throughout Russia of the kurgans, or ancient artificial\r\nmounds, distribution of which seems to correspond closely with the\r\noriginal habitat of the Nordics.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern France there is indicated the area where the Cro-Magnon\r\nrace persisted longest and where traces of it are still to be found. The\r\nsite is shown of the type station of the latest phase of the Paleolithic\r\nknown as the Mas d’Azil—a great cavern in the eastern Pyrenees from\r\nwhich that period took its name of Azilian.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the Baltic Sea is also shown the type station of the\r\nMaglemose culture which flourished at the close of the Paleolithic and\r\nwas probably the work of early Nordics.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the district occupied by the Alpines is located\r\nRobenhausen, the most characteristic of the Neolithic lake dwelling\r\nstations and also the Terramara stations in which a culture transitional\r\nbetween the Neolithic and the bronze existed. In the Tyrol the site is\r\nindicated of the village of Hallstatt, which gave its name to the first\r\niron culture.\r\n\r\nThe site of La Tène at the north end of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland is\r\nalso shown. From this village the La Tène Iron Age takes its name.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of depicting the shifting of races during twelve\r\ncenturies is not easily overcome, but the map attempts to show that at\r\nthe close of the Neolithic all the coast lands of the Mediterranean and\r\nof the Atlantic seaboard up to Germany and including the British Isles\r\nwere populated by the Mediterranean race, in addition, of course, to\r\nremnants of earlier Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons, who probably, at that\r\ndate, still formed an appreciable portion of the population.\r\n\r\nThe yellow arrows indicate the route of the migrations of Mediterranean\r\nman, who appears to have entered Europe from the east along the African\r\nlittoral. But the main invasions passed up through Spain and Gaul into\r\nthe British Isles, where from that time to this they have formed the\r\nsubstratum of the population. In the central portion of their range\r\nthese Mediterraneans were swamped by the Alpines, as shown by the\r\nspreading green, while in northern Gaul and Britain the Mediterraneans\r\nwere submerged afterward by Nordics, as appears on the later maps.\r\n\r\nThe arrows and routes of migration shown on the yellow area of this map\r\nindicate changes which occurred during the Neolithic and perhaps\r\nearlier, but the pink and red arrows in the northern and southeastern\r\nportions represent migrations which were in full swing and in fact were\r\nsteadily increasing during the entire period involved. The next map\r\nshows these Nordics bursting out of their original homeland in every\r\ndirection and in their turn conquering Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAXIMUM EXPANSION of ALPINES with BRONZE\r\nCULTURE—3000–1800 B.C. (generalized scheme) by Madison Grant]\r\n\r\nBetween these two races, the Mediterranean and the Nordic, there entered\r\na great intrusion of Alpines, flowing from the highlands of western Asia\r\nthrough Asia Minor and up the valley of the Danube throughout central\r\nEurope and thence expanding in every direction. Forerunners of these\r\nsame Alpines were found in western Europe as far back as the closing\r\nAzilian phase of the Paleolithic, where they are known as the\r\nFurfooz-Grenelle race and are thus contemporary in western Europe with\r\nthe earliest Mediterraneans.\r\n\r\nDuring all the Neolithic the Alpines occupied the mountainous core of\r\nEurope, but their great and final expansion occurred at the close of the\r\nNeolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Period, when a new and\r\nextensive Alpine invasion from the region of the Armenian highlands\r\nbrought in the Bronze culture. This last migration apparently followed\r\nthe routes of the earlier invasions and, in the extreme southwest, it\r\neven reached Spain in small numbers, where its remnants can still be\r\nfound in the Cantabrian Alps. The Alpines occupied all Savoy and central\r\nFrance, where from that day to this they constitute the bulk of the\r\npeasant population. They reached Brittany and to-day that peninsula is\r\ntheir westernmost outpost. They crossed over in small numbers to Britain\r\nand some even reached Ireland. In England they were the men of the Round\r\nBarrows, but nearly all trace of this invasion has vanished from the\r\nliving population.\r\n\r\nThe Alpines also reached Holland, Denmark and southwestern Norway and\r\ntraces of their colonization in these countries are still found.\r\n\r\nThe author has attempted to indicate the lines of this Alpine expansion\r\nby means of the solid green spreading over central Europe and Asia\r\nMinor, with outlying dots showing the outer limits of the invasion.\r\nBlack arrows proceeding from the east denote its main lines and routes.\r\nThose Alpines who crossed the Caucasus passed through southern Russia\r\nand a side wave of the same migration passed down the Syrian coast to\r\nEgypt and along the north coast of Africa, entering Italy by way of\r\nSicily. The last African invasion left behind it the Giza round skulls\r\nof Egypt. This final Alpine expansion taught the other races of Europe,\r\nboth Mediterranean and Nordic, the art of metallurgy.\r\n\r\nThe Nordics apparently originated in southern Russia, but long before\r\nthe Bronze Period they had spread northward across the Baltic into\r\nScandinavia, where they specialized into the race now known as the\r\nScandinavian or Teutonic. On the map the continental Nordics are\r\nindicated by pink and the Nordics of Scandinavia are shown in red. At\r\nthe very end of the period covered by this map, these Scandinavian\r\nNordics were beginning to return to the continent. The routes of these\r\nmigrations and their extent are indicated by red arrows and circles\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this map shows the expansion from central Asia of the round\r\nskull Alpines across central Europe, submerging, in the south and west,\r\nthe little, dark, long skulled Mediterraneans of Neolithic culture,\r\nwhile at the same time they pressed heavily upon the Nordics in the\r\nnorth and introduced Bronze culture among them.\r\n\r\nThis development of the Alpines at the expense of the Mediterraneans had\r\na permanent influence in western Europe, but in the north their impress\r\nwas of a more temporary character. It is probable that in the first\r\ninstance they were able to conquer the Nordics by reason of the\r\nsuperiority of bronze weapons to stone hatchets. But no sooner had they\r\nimparted the knowledge of the manufacture and use of metal weapons and\r\ntools to the Nordics than the latter turned on their conquerors and\r\ncompletely mastered them, as appears on the next map.\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE EXPANSION OF THE PRE-TEUTONIC NORDICS, 1800–100 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe second map (Pl. II) of the series shows the shattering and\r\nsubmergence of the green Alpine area by the pink Nordic area. It will be\r\nnoted that in Italy, Spain, France and Britain the solid green and the\r\ngreen dots have steadily declined and in central Europe the green has\r\nbeen torn apart and riddled in every direction by pink arrows and pink\r\ndots, leaving solid green only in mountainous and infertile districts.\r\nThis submergence of the Alpines by the Nordics was so complete that\r\ntheir very existence was forgotten until in our own day it was\r\ndiscovered that the central core of Europe was inhabited by a short,\r\nstocky, round skulled race originally from Asia. To-day these Alpines\r\nare gradually recovering their influence in the world by sheer weight of\r\nnumbers. On this map the green Alpine area is shown to be everywhere\r\nshrinking except in the countries around the Carpathians and the Dnieper\r\nRiver, where the Sarmatians and Wends are located. It was in this\r\ndistrict that the Slavic-speaking Alpines were developing.\r\nSimultaneously with this expansion toward the west, south and east of\r\nthe continental Nordics, the Scandinavian or Teutonic tribes appear on\r\nthe scene in increasing numbers, as shown by the red area and red\r\narrows, pressing upon and forcing ahead of them their kinsmen on the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPANSION OF THE PRE-TEUTONIC NORDICS 1800–100 B.C.\r\n(generalized scheme) by Madison Grant]\r\n\r\nThe pink arrows in Spain show the invasion of Celtic-speaking Nordics,\r\nclosely related to the Nordic Gauls who a little earlier had conquered\r\nFrance. This same wave of Nordic invasion crossed the Channel and\r\nappears in the pink dots of Britain and Ireland, where the intruders are\r\nknown as Goidels. These early Nordics were followed some centuries later\r\nby another wave of kindred peoples who were known as Brythons or Cymry\r\nin Britain and as Belgæ on the continent. These Cymric Belgæ or Brythons\r\nprobably represented the mixed descendants of the earliest Teutons who\r\ncrossed from Scandinavia and had adopted and modified the Celtic\r\nlanguages spoken by the continental Nordics. These Cymric-speaking\r\nNordics drove before them the earlier Gauls in France and the Goidels in\r\nBritain, but their impulse westward was very likely caused by the\r\noncoming rush of pure Teutons from Scandinavia and the Baltic coasts.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the pink arrows entering from the west show the route of the\r\ninvading Gauls, who occupied the country north of the Apennines and made\r\nit Cisalpine Gaul, while the arrows entering Italy from the northeast\r\nshow the earlier invasions of the Nordic Umbrians and Oscans, who\r\nintroduced Aryan speech into Italy. Farther east in Greece and the\r\nBalkans, the pink arrows show the routes of invasion of the Achæans and\r\nthe kindred Phrygians of Homer as well as the later Dorians and\r\nCimmerians. In the region of the Caucasus, the routes of the invading\r\nPersians are shown and, north of the Caspian Sea, the line of migration\r\nof the Sacæ from the grasslands of southern Russia toward the east. In\r\nthe inset map in the upper right corner is shown the expansion of these\r\nNordics into Asia, where the Sacæ and closely related Massagetæ occupied\r\nwhat is now Turkestan and from this centre swarmed over the mountains of\r\nAfghanistan into India and introduced Aryan speech among the swarming\r\nmillions of that peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the main map the expansion of the Teutonic\r\nNordics is shown, with the Goths in the east and Saxons in the west of\r\nthe red area, but the salient feature is the expansion of the pink at\r\nthe expense of the green and the ominous growth of the red area centring\r\naround Scandinavia in the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE EXPANSION OF THE TEUTONIC NORDICS AND SLAVIC ALPINES, 100 B. C. TO\r\n                               1100 A. D.\r\n\r\nThis map (Pl. III) shows the yellow area greatly diminished in central\r\nand northern Europe, while it retains its supremacy in Spain and Italy\r\nas well as on the north coast of Africa. In the latter areas the green\r\ndots have nearly vanished and have been replaced by pink and red dots.\r\nIn central Europe the green area is still more broken up and reduced to\r\na minimum. In the Balkans and eastern Europe, however, two large centres\r\nof green, north and south of the Danube respectively, represent the\r\nexpanding power of the Slavic-speaking Alpines. The pink area of the\r\ncontinental Nordics is everywhere fading and is on the point of\r\nvanishing as a distinctive type and of merging in the red. The expansion\r\nof the Teutonic Nordics from Scandinavia and from the north of Germany\r\nis now at its maximum and they are everywhere pressing through the\r\nEmpire of Rome and laying the foundations of the modern nations of\r\nEurope. The Vandals have migrated from the coasts of the Baltic to what\r\nis now Hungary, then westward into France and finally, after occupying\r\nfor a while southern Spain, under pressure of the kindred Visigoths to\r\nnorthern Africa, where they established a kingdom which is the sole\r\nexample we have of a Teutonic state on that continent. The Visigoths and\r\nSuevi laid the foundations of Spain and Portugal, while the Franks,\r\nBurgundians and Normans transformed Gaul into France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPANSION OF THE TEUTONIC NORDICS AND SLAVIC ALPINES 100\r\nBC–1100 AD (generalized scheme) by Madison Grant]\r\n\r\nInto Italy for a thousand years floods of Nordic Teutons crossed the\r\nAlps and settled along the Po Valley. While many tribes participated in\r\nthese invasions, the most important migration was that of the Lombards,\r\nwho, coming from the basin of the Baltic by way of the Danubian plains,\r\noccupied the Po Valley in force and scattered a Teutonic nobility\r\nthroughout the peninsula. The Lombard and kindred strains in the north\r\ngive to that portion of the peninsula its present predominance over the\r\nprovinces south of the Apennines.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the British Isles by the Teutonic and Scandinavian\r\nNordics was far more complete than was their conquest of Spain, Italy or\r\neven northern France. When these Teutons arrived upon the scene, the\r\nancient, dark Neolithics had very largely absorbed the early Nordic\r\ninvaders, Goidels and Cymry alike. Floods of Saxons, of Angles and later\r\nof Danes, crossed the Channel and the North Sea and displaced the old\r\npopulation in Scotland and the eastern half of England, while Norse\r\nVikings following in their wake occupied nearly all of the outlying\r\nislands and much of the coast. Both these later invasions, Danish and\r\nNorse, passed around the greater island and inundated Ireland, so that\r\nthe big, blond or red-haired Irishman of to-day is to a large extent a\r\nDane in a state of culture analogous to that of Scotland before the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nThis map shows that the vitality of Scandinavia was far from exhausted\r\nafter sending for upward of two thousand years tribe after tribe across\r\nto the continent and that it was now producing an extraordinarily\r\nvigorous type, the Vikings in the west and the equally warlike and\r\nenergetic Varangians in the east, who migrated back to the motherland of\r\nthe Nordics and laid the foundations of modern Russia.\r\n\r\nWhile all these splendid conquests were in full swing a little known\r\ngroup of tribes was growing and spreading in eastern and southern\r\nGermany and in Austria-Hungary and occupying the lands left vacant by\r\nthe Teutonic nations, which had invaded the Roman Empire. From this\r\ncentre in the neighborhood of the Carpathians and in Galicia eastward to\r\nthe head of the Dnieper River, the Wends and Sarmatians expanded in all\r\ndirections. They were the ancestors of those Alpines who are to-day\r\nSlavic-speaking. From this obscure beginning came the bulk of the\r\nRussians and the South Slavs. The expansion of the Slavs is one of the\r\nmost significant features of the Dark Ages and the author has attempted\r\nto indicate the centre of expansion of these tribes by green dots and\r\ngreen arrows, radiating in all directions from the solid green area in\r\nEurope. To sum up this map, the yellow area has steadily declined\r\neverywhere, while in western Europe the green area is now limited to the\r\ninfertile and backward mountain regions. In eastern Europe, however,\r\nthis same green Alpine area is showing a marvellous capacity for\r\nrecovery, as will appear from the map of the races of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe red area is widely spread and occupies the river valleys and the\r\nfertile lands and represents everywhere the ruling, military aristocracy\r\nmore or less thinly scattered over a conquered peasantry of\r\nMediterranean and Alpine blood. One phenomenon of dire import is shown\r\non the map, where, coming from the districts north and east of the\r\nCaspian Sea, certain black arrows are seen shooting westward into\r\nEurope, reaching in one extreme instance as far as Châlons in France,\r\nwhere Attila nearly succeeded in destroying what remained of western\r\ncivilization. These arrows mark respectively Huns, Cumans, Avars,\r\nMagyars, Bulgars and other Asiatic hordes, probably for the most part of\r\nMongoloid origin and coming originally from central Asia far beyond the\r\nrange of Aryan speech. These hordes of Mongoloids destroyed the budding\r\nculture of Russia, while at a later date kindred tribes under the name\r\nof Turks or Tatars flooded the Balkans and the valley of the Danube but\r\nthese later invasions entered Europe from Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRESENT DISTRIBUTION\r\n  OF\r\n  EUROPEAN RACES\r\n  (generalized scheme)\r\n  by\r\n  Madison Grant\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF EUROPEAN RACES\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the last map (Pl. IV), showing the present\r\ndistribution of European races, was in some respects a more intricate\r\ntask than that of the earlier maps. The main difficulty is that, as a\r\nresult of successive migrations and expansions, the different races of\r\nEurope are now often represented by distinct classes. Numerically one\r\ntype may be in a majority, as are the Rumanians in eastern Hungary,\r\nwhere they constitute nearly two-thirds of the population. At the same\r\ntime this majority is of no intellectual or social importance, since all\r\nthe professional and military classes in Transylvania are either Magyar\r\nor Saxon. Under the existing scheme of showing majorities by color these\r\nruling minorities do not appear at all. In this last map the yellow is\r\nbeginning to expand, especially in the British Isles. The green also is\r\nrecovering somewhat in central and western Europe, but in the Balkans,\r\neastern Germany, Austria and above all in Poland and Russia, it has\r\nlargely replaced the former Nordic color. The pink, _i. e._, the\r\ncontinental Nordics as a distinct type, has entirely vanished and has\r\nbeen everywhere replaced by the Teutonic red. This does not mean that\r\nthere are no existing remnants of the continental Nordics, but it does\r\nmean that these remnants cannot now be distinguished from the\r\nall-pervading and masterful type of the Teutonic Nordics.\r\n\r\nIn general, this last map, as compared with the earlier ones, although\r\nshowing a steady shrinkage of the Nordic area, brings out clearly the\r\nmanner in which it centres around the basins of the Baltic and the North\r\nSea, radiating thence in every direction and in decreasing numbers. The\r\nmenace of the continued expansion of the green area westward and\r\nnorthward into the red area of the Nordics is undoubtedly one of the\r\ncauses of the present world war. This expansion began as far back as the\r\nfall of Rome, but only in our day and generation has this backward race\r\neven claimed a parity of strength and culture with the Master Race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DOCUMENTARY SUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these notes is to meet an insistent demand for\r\nauthorities for the statements made in the body of the book. As was\r\nmentioned in the Introduction, in a work of this compass and aim, mere\r\nlack of space forbade all but the barest outlines, so that often an\r\nappearance of dogmatism was the result.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast literature on the subjects discussed and to give all the\r\nreferences would be almost a physical impossibility. It is particularly\r\ndifficult to name all that has appeared in periodicals, since they have\r\nbecome so numerous, especially during the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe author has in mind to refer only to those works which bear directly\r\non the most essential statements made and, necessarily, to but a part of\r\nthese. In many cases only books which are most easily available have\r\nbeen used. The author has intentionally quoted chiefly works in English,\r\nwhere these exist, and when using foreign authorities has translated the\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that the references are given for the\r\nfacts rather than the theories they contain. In no case, unless\r\nspecifically stated, is the author committed to the conclusions drawn in\r\nthe works cited. In order to present all sides, authorities who differ\r\nin viewpoint are sometimes listed, the reader being left to make his own\r\ndecision of the case.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the references will be of assistance to students of\r\nanthropology and to those who care to inquire further into the subjects\r\nunder discussion.\r\n\r\nWhere an author is quoted frequently or for more than one book, he is\r\nreferred to merely by name; the book is given by number immediately\r\nfollowing. Its full title may be ascertained in the bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DOCUMENTARY SUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _PART I_\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPage xix : line 22.

Immutability of psychical predispositions and impulses. See\r\nnote above. Professor Irving Fisher said, on p. 627 of _National\r\nVitality_, speaking of laws relating to eugenics: “What such laws might\r\naccomplish may be judged from the history of two criminal families, the\r\n‘Jukes’ and the ‘Tribe of Ishmael.’ Out of 1,200 descendants from the\r\nfounder of the ‘Jukes’ through 75 years, 310 were professional\r\npaupers ... 50 were prostitutes, 7 murderers, 60 habitual thieves, and\r\n130 common criminals.” Certainly these facts were not all due entirely\r\nto identity or similarity of environment. On p. 675 we read: “Similarly,\r\nthe ‘Tribe of Ishmael,’ numbering 1,692 individuals in six generations,\r\nhas produced 121 known prostitutes and has bred hundreds of petty\r\nthieves, vagrants and murderers. The history of the tribe is a swiftly\r\nmoving picture of social degeneration and gross parasitism extending\r\nfrom its seventeenth century convict ancestry to the present day horde\r\nof wandering and criminal descendants.” See R. L. Dugdale and Oscar C.\r\nMcCulloch, pp. 154–159. For transmission of opposite tendencies see pp.\r\n675–676, Fisher. The Jukes were a family of Dutch descent, living in an\r\nisolated valley in the mountains of northern New York. The Ishmaels were\r\na family of central Indiana which came from Maryland through Kentucky.\r\nThe Kalikak family is another striking instance. See also Davenport, 1,\r\nand the note to p. 226: 7.\r\n\r\nxxi : 5. Professor Charles B.

Davenport, Frederic Adams Woods, G. Archdall\r\nReid, Edwin G. Conklin, Thomas Hunt Morgan, E. B. Wilson, J. Arthur\r\nThomson, William E. Castle, and Henry Fairfield Osborn, 2.\r\n\r\n14 : 10 _seq._ Blends. E. G. Conklin remarks in correspondence: “In so\r\nfar as races interbreed, their characters mingle but do not blend or\r\nfuse, and come out again in all their purity in descendants.” See also\r\nthe same authority, 1, pp. 208, 280, 282–287.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then an observation is met with which corroborates this\r\nstatement. The inheritance from one parent or the other of the shape of\r\nthe skull, in a fairly pure form, has been noted a number of times.\r\n\r\nFleure and James in their study of the _Anthropological Types in Wales_,\r\np. 39, make the following observation: “It may be said that certain\r\ncomponent features of head form, in many cases, seem to segregate more\r\nor less in Mendelian fashion, but this is a matter for further\r\ninvestigation; we are on safer ground in saying that the children of\r\nparents of different head form very frequently show a fairly complete\r\nresemblance to one or other parent, _i. e._, that head form is\r\nfrequently inherited in a fairly pure fashion.”\r\n\r\nVon Luschan found still more striking evidence of this in his study of\r\nmodern Greeks, which he describes in his _Early Inhabitants of Western\r\nAsia_. He has found that the children of parents of different head form\r\ninherit in quite strict fashion the shape of skull of one or the other\r\nparent, and that the population, instead of being mesaticephalic, is\r\nto-day as distinctly divided into two groups, dolichol- and\r\nbrachycephalic, as in prehistoric times, in spite of the constant\r\nintermixture that has occurred.\r\n\r\n14 : 18.

Anders Retzius was the first to make use of the head form in\r\nanthropological study, and to give the impetus to the index measurement\r\nsystem in _The Form of the Skulls of the Northern Peoples of Europe_.\r\nSee also A. C. Haddon, 1, chap. I, in which he discusses these traits in\r\nfull, and Ripley, chap. III, especially pp. 55 _seq._ Modern physical\r\nanthropologists still agree that the skull form is a most stable and\r\nreliable character.\r\n\r\n19 : 25. Ripley, p. 39.\r\n\r\n19 : 27–pp. 20 and 21. Beddoe, Broca, Collignon, Livi, Topinard and a\r\nhost of other anthropologists all affirm the existence of three European\r\nracial types, which Ripley has discussed exhaustively. Deniker alone\r\ndiffers from them in classifying the populations of Europe, from the\r\nsame data, into six principal races and four or more sub-races. See\r\nAppendix D, in Ripley’s _Races of Europe_.\r\n\r\nThe three terms, Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean, have now become quite\r\ngenerally accepted designations for the three European races. The term\r\nNord, rather than Nordic, has been chosen, perhaps more wisely, by some\r\nauthors. In the present book these names are applied with quite\r\ndifferent connotations from those usually understood.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too clearly stated that in speaking of Nordics, the\r\nproto-type was probably quite generalized, with hair shades including\r\nthe browns and reds. In the author’s opinion the blond Scandinavian\r\nrepresents an extreme specialization of Nordic characters. (See p. 167\r\nof this book.)\r\n\r\n20 : 5–24. The term Nordic was first used by Deniker. The authorities\r\nfor the descriptions of these races may all be found in Ripley. The\r\nMediterranean race was first defined by Sergi, who also calls it\r\nEurafrican. The term Alpine, proposed by Linnæus, was revived by\r\nDeLapouge, and later adopted by Ripley, since when it has come into\r\ngeneral use. Sergi and Zaborowski prefer that of Eurasian. While this\r\nlatter name does cover the requirements, since it correctly signifies\r\nnot only the European and Asiatic range of the people under discussion,\r\nbut also their actual relationship to Asiatics, it is objectionable\r\nbecause it implies the adoption of the similarly constructed term\r\nEurafrican, which, as defined by Sergi, is misleading. Correct as\r\nEurafrican may be for signifying the European and African range of the\r\nMediterranean race, it involves an acceptance of the theory put forward\r\nby its sponsor, that the Mediterranean race originated in Africa and is\r\nclosely related to the negro, both being long skulled peoples, descended\r\nfrom a common stock, the Eurafrican.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the term Mediterranean is that the race extends\r\nin habitat beyond the Mediterranean region, but the name is now so\r\ngenerally accepted and this fact so well known that misunderstandings\r\nare unlikely. The term Alpine, also, is not as inappropriate as it might\r\nseem, since the word Alps is frequently not confined to the Swiss ranges\r\nbut extended to many other mountain chains, and Alpine, like the term\r\nMediterranean, is not, at this late date, apt to be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n20 : 24–21: 9.

There are numerous other references\r\nto this fact, especially in articles in various anthropological\r\njournals, and general works on anthropology, such as those of Deniker,\r\nCollignon, Martin and Ratzel.\r\n\r\n23 : 16. For the differentiation of skull types in Europe during the\r\nPaleolithic period, see Keith, 2, the chapters on Pre-Neolithic,\r\nMousterian and Neanderthal man; and 1, pp. 74 _seq._; as well as Osborn,\r\n1, who also gives the dates of the Paleolithic in the table on p. 18.\r\n\r\n24 : 3–5. This claim was put forth by Sergi, in his _Mediterranean\r\nRace_, pp. 252, 258–259, and was followed by Ripley in his _Races of\r\nEurope_.\r\n\r\n24 : 14.

Ripley says: “If the hair be light, one can generally be sure that\r\nthe eyes will be of a corresponding shade.

Sir Edmund Loder, in correspondence, February, 1917, asks: “Has\r\nit been noticed at Creedmore and elsewhere in America that nearly all\r\nnoted shots have blue eyes? It has been very noticeable at Wimbledon and\r\nBisby, where it was quite exceptional to find a man in the front rank of\r\nmarksmen with dark colored eyes. There was, however, one man who shot in\r\nmy team who had very dark eyes and was one of the best shots of the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n25 : 16. There are said to be blue eyes occasionally in other races,\r\nwhere traces of Nordic blood cannot be discovered. Green and blue eyes\r\nhave been found among the Rendeli (Desert Masai), although they are\r\notherwise normal negroes.\r\n\r\n25 : 19. The following quotation is from Von Luschan, 1, p. 224: “In\r\nMarmaritza near Halikarnassos, where a British squadron had a winter\r\nstation for many years, a very great proportion of the children is said\r\nto be ‘flaxen-haired.’” According to a statement made to the author by\r\nProfessor G. Elliot Smith on May 4, 1920, a similar nest of blondness is\r\nfound in the Egyptian delta near Aboukir and is due to the fact that\r\nafter the battle of the Nile the Seaforth Highlanders were long\r\nstationed there. At one time this blondness was supposed to bear some\r\nrelation to the ancient Lybian blondness depicted on the monuments.\r\n\r\n25 : 25 _seq._ On the Berbers see Sergi, 4, pp. 59 _seq._, and Topinard,\r\n3. In regard to the Albanians, Ripley refers to their blondness, on p.\r\n414, as follows: “The Albanian colonists, studied by Livi and Zampa in\r\nCalabria, still, after four centuries of Italian residence and\r\nintermixture, cling to many of their primitive characteristics, notably\r\ntheir brachycephaly and their relative blondness.” See also Zampa, 1,\r\nand Deniker, 1, for scientific discussions of their physical characters.\r\nGiuffrida-Ruggeri gives a summary of the most recent literature on\r\nAlbania.\r\n\r\n25 : 29–26: 6.

Probably these will be determined by Mr. Louis\r\nR. Sullivan, of the American Museum of Natural History, who is working\r\non the subject. It has been found that the Japanese and Eskimo are\r\nexceptions to the rule of “straight hair, round cross section,” for they\r\nshow an ellipse. There is also a wide range of variation in the\r\ncross-sections of hair for individuals of any race, who are classified\r\naccording to the preponderance of cross-sections of a single type.

For a full description of these people see\r\nZaborowski, _Les peuples aryens d’Asie et d’Europe_, pp. 246–272.\r\nDeniker likewise treats of them in _Races of Man_, p. 356. Minns,\r\n_Scythians and Greeks_, p. 37, says: “Klaproth first proved in 1822 that\r\nthe Ossetes are the same as the Caucasian Alans, and this is supported\r\nby the testimony of the chroniclers, Russian, Georgian, Greek and Arab.\r\nFrom Ammianus Marcellinus (XXXI, II, 16–25) we know that at the time of\r\nthe Huns’ invasion these Alans pastured their herds over the plains to\r\nthe north of the Caucasus, and made raids upon the coast of the Mæotis\r\nand the peninsula of Taman. The Huns passed through their land,\r\nplundering Ermanrich, the king of the Goths.... Ammianus means by Alans\r\nall the nomadic tribes about the Tanais (Don) and gives a description of\r\ntheir habits, borrowed from the account of the Scythians in Herodotus.\r\nFor the first three centuries of our era we find these Alans mentioned\r\n(Pliny, _N. H._, IV, 80; Dionysius Perigetes, 305, 306; Fl. Josephus,\r\nBell. Jud., VII, VII, 4; Ptolemy, etc.), as neighbors of the Sarmatians\r\non this side or the other of the Don, living the same life and counting\r\nas one of their tribes. That is, that the Ossetes, Jasy, Alans,\r\nSarmatians[4] are all of one stock, once nomad, now confined to the\r\nvalleys of the central chain of the Caucasus. The Ossetes are tall,\r\nwell-made, and inclined to be fair, corresponding to the description of\r\nthe Alans in Ammianus (XXXI, II, 21) and their Iranian language answers\r\nto the accounts of the Sarmatians, of whom Pliny says ‘Medorum ut ferunt\r\nsoboles’ (_N. H._, VI, 19).”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The author agrees with Zaborowski and differs from Minns in his belief\r\n  that the Ossetes are of Nordic stock while the Sarmatians were\r\n  Alpines.\r\n\r\nChantre found among the Ossetes 30 per cent of blonds. See Chantre, 2.\r\n\r\n66 : 16. Alans. See Jordanes, _History of the Goths_, Mierow\r\ntranslation. Procopius, writing about 550 A. D., says: “At this time the\r\nAlani and the Absagi were Christians and friends of the Romans of old\r\nand lived in the neighborhood of the Caucasus.” In his vol. III, chap.\r\nII, 2–8, we read of the period from 395–425 A. D. “There were many\r\nGothic nations in earlier times just as also at the present, but the\r\ngreatest and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths and\r\nGepædes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatæ and\r\nMelanchlæni, and there were some too who called these nations Getic. All\r\nthese, while they are distinguished from one another by their names, as\r\nhas been said, do not differ in anything else at all. For they all have\r\nwhite bodies and fair hair and are tall and handsome to look upon, and\r\nthey use the same laws, and practise a common religion. For they are all\r\nof the Arian faith and have one language called ‘Gothic.’” (Procopius\r\nthinks they all came originally from one tribe, and were distinguished\r\nlater by the names of those who led each group of old. They dwelt north\r\nof the Danube and later the Gepædes took possession of the portion south\r\nof the river. In regard to the derivation of the Goths and other tribes\r\nfrom the Sauromatæ, compare the note on Sarmatians, for p. 143 : 21.)

This term, although said not to have been invented by\r\nKlaproth, was used by him as early as 1823. See Leo Meyer, in _Über den\r\nUrsprung der Namen Indo-Germanen, Semiten und Ugro-finner,\r\nGöttingergelehrte Nachrichten, philologisch-historische Klasse_, 1901,\r\npp. 454 _seq._\r\n\r\n67 : 4. The idea of an Aryan race was first promulgated by Oscar\r\nSchrader in his _Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte_. That there was an\r\noriginal Aryan tongue but no Aryan race was the idea of Broca. Pösche\r\nidentified the Aryans with the Reihengraber type. Consult also Penka,\r\n_Herkunft der Arier_ and _Origines Ariacæ_.\r\n\r\n67 : 12. See Zaborowski, 1, pp. 1–10.\r\n\r\n67 : 15.

These paragraphs elicited a very interesting letter from\r\na British officer in Howrah, Bengal, India, in October, 1919. He says:\r\n“May I offer one or two remarks on points of detail? On p. 70 it is\r\nstated ‘The Hindu to-day speaks a very ancient form of Aryan language\r\nbut there remains not one recognizable trace of the blood of the white\r\nconquerors who poured in through the passes of the Northwest,’ and again\r\nat p. 261, ‘Of all the wonderful conquests of the Sacæ there remain as\r\nevidence of their invasions only these Indian and Afghan languages. Dim\r\ntraces of their blood, as stated before, have been found in the Pamirs\r\nand in Afghanistan, but in the South their blond traits have vanished,\r\neven from the Punjab. It may be that the stature of some of the Afghan\r\nhill tribes and of the Sikhs, and some of the facial characters of the\r\nlatter, are derived from this source, but all blondness of skin, hair\r\nand eye of the original Sacæ have utterly vanished.’\r\n\r\n“This hardly agrees with my own observations during two years’ service\r\nin the Punjab and Northwest Frontier Province. I should say that among\r\nthe Pathans living in British territory about Peshawar, blond\r\ntraits,—fair skin, the color of old ivory, red or brown hair, grey,\r\ngreen, or blue eyes,—are as common as really black hair is in Scotland;\r\nwhile among Panjabi Mussulmans living about Jhelum these traits are, if\r\nnot common, at least not extremely rare. Judging from the experience of\r\none squadron of cavalry, I should put the proportion of men with blond\r\ntraits at not less than one per cent. The women, whom one does not see,\r\nmust be fairer than the men, as elsewhere. I have seen a small Panjabi\r\nMahommedan girl, from about Dera Ismail Khan with _yellow_ hair. I have\r\nalso seen a _Sikh_ with _red_ hair, but that was certainly exceptional.\r\n\r\n“These remarks are based on what I have seen myself, though no\r\nstatistics are kept and it is possible that I am generalizing from\r\ninsufficient data. It would not, however, I think, be too much to say\r\nthat ‘Blond traits are not uncommon in Afghanistan, and are even to be\r\nfound among Mussulmans in the Northwestern Panjab.’ (Afghans and Indian\r\nMussulmans of course sometimes dye their beards red, but this artificial\r\nblondness has not been confused with the real thing.)”\r\n\r\nThe following quotation is from _The Outlook_ for March 10, 1920, which\r\ncontains an article entitled “The Present Situation in India,” by\r\nMajor-General Thomas D. Pilcher, of the British Army.\r\n\r\n“Beside these castes there are tribes, and the Brahmin from the Punjab\r\nhas very little indeed in common with the Brahmin from Bengal or Madras.\r\nMany Pathans and Punjabi Mohammedans have blue eyes and are no darker\r\nthan a southern European, whereas some of the depressed tribes are as\r\nblack as Negroes. Many of the northern peoples are at least as tall as\r\nmen of our own race, whereas other tribes do not average five feet.”\r\n\r\n70 : 16. Castes. Deniker, 2, p. 403: “About 2,000 castes may be\r\nenumerated at the present day, but year by year new ones are being\r\ncalled into existence as a certain number disappear.” In his footnote\r\nDeniker says: “The so-called primitive division into four castes:\r\nBrahmans (priests), Kshatriya (soldiers), Vaisyas (husbandmen and\r\nmerchants), and Sudra (common people, outcasts, subject peoples?),\r\nmentioned in the later texts of the Vedas, is rather an indication of\r\nthe division into three principal classes of the ruling race as opposed,\r\nin a homogeneous whole, to the conquered aboriginal race (fourth\r\ncaste).” He continues: “The essential characteristics of all castes,\r\npersisting amid every change of form, are endogamy within themselves and\r\nthe regulation forbidding them to come into contact one with another and\r\npartake of food together.”\r\n\r\nSee also Zaborowski, _Les peuples aryens_, p. 65. There is, of course,\r\nan enormous number of books which deal with the caste system of India.\r\n\r\n71 : 7. Sir G. Archdall Reid, 2, p. 186: “If history teaches any lesson\r\nwith clearness, it is this, that conquest, to be permanent, must be\r\naccompanied with extermination; otherwise, in the fulness of time, the\r\nnatives expel or absorb the conquerors. The Saxon conquest of England\r\nwas permanent; of the Norman conquest there remains scarcely a trace.”\r\n\r\n71 : 24. See pp. 217–222 and notes.\r\n\r\n72 : 4. See the notes to p. 141 : 4 _seq._\r\n\r\n72 : 19. Ripley, pp. 219–220, says: “The race question in Germany came\r\nto the front some years ago under rather peculiar circumstances. Shortly\r\nafter the Franco-Prussian War, De Quatrefages promulgated the theory ...\r\nthat the dominant people in Germany were not Teutons at all, but were\r\ndirectly descended from the Finns. Being nothing but Finns, they were to\r\nbe classed with the Lapps and other peoples of western Russia.... Coming\r\nat a time of profound national humiliation in France ... the book\r\ncreated a profound sensation.... A champion of the Germans was not hard\r\nto find. Professor Virchow of Berlin set himself to work to disprove the\r\ntheory which thus damned the dominant people of the empire. The\r\ncontroversy, half political and half scientific, waxed hot at times....\r\nOne great benefit flowed indirectly from it all, however. The German\r\ngovernment was induced to authorize the official census of the color of\r\nhair and eyes of the six million school children of the empire.... It\r\nestablished beyond question the differences in pigmentation between the\r\nNorth and the South of Germany. At the same time it showed the\r\nsimilarity in blondness between all the peoples along the Baltic. The\r\nHohenzollern territory was as Teutonic in this respect as the\r\nHanoverian.”\r\n\r\n73 : 6.

Strite, a lawyer of Hagerstown,\r\nMaryland, contains additional information on the so-called Pennsylvania\r\nDutch. Mr. Strite says: “They are not Palatine Germans, but largely\r\nSwiss who speak a dialect of German. The writer happens to be of this\r\nstock. Its characteristics are round head, black hair, dark brown eyes,\r\nstocky stature, brunet type, all clearly indicating, according to your\r\nanalysis, an Alpine origin. This description fairly well averages up the\r\nprevailing Pennsylvania Dutch type of this section although there are\r\nsome red heads and some blonds which would indicate a Nordic admixture,\r\nagain meeting your argument. There are many other varieties of Teutons\r\nin this section, but I am confining my remarks to the class known as the\r\nPennsylvania Dutch. I have never made any head measurements among them\r\nbut I am of the opinion that the round-headed type vastly predominates.\r\nThe ancestors of these people emigrated from southern Europe, mostly\r\nSwitzerland, in quite some numbers between the years 1700 and 1775, and\r\nsettled in Lancaster County, Pa.; from thence they have spread out over\r\nthe adjoining sections of Pennsylvania, down through the Cumberland\r\nvalley and into the valley of Virginia, and to-day they form an\r\nimportant element of the population. They are the organizers in America\r\nof the religious sect known as the Mennonites.\r\n\r\n“The early settlers of Germantown who were Mennonites, were of Palatine\r\nstock. Of this there can be no doubt. Later immigration to Lancaster\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, which constituted the bulk of the Pennsylvania\r\nDutch stock will be found, I think, largely to have come from\r\nSwitzerland, although not exclusively. Rupp’s _30,000 Names of\r\nImmigrants to America_ gives the names, dates and sailings of this\r\nMennonite stock. Your conclusions are correct enough for all practical\r\npurposes but it seemed to me that the immigrants from Switzerland and\r\nfrom the Palatinate might be distinguished.”\r\n\r\nDoctor C. P. Noble, of Radnor, Pa., writes concerning the Pennsylvania\r\nDutch: “I have seen much of them as patients and as I have observed them\r\nthey have the medium stature and stocky build of the Alpines, also they\r\nhave, usually, broad, round faces which are associated with\r\nbrachycephaly and certainly they have always exhibited peasant traits.\r\nMoreover, it is unusual to find a blond among them.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Jordan, of the Pennsylvania Historical Society, furnished Doctor\r\nNoble with some data concerning them. That there were some Alpine\r\nelements among them will appear from what follows. Doctor Jordan agreed\r\nthat the present day Pennsylvania Germans are almost exclusively brunet,\r\nwith stocky bodies of moderate height. Existing portraits of various\r\nleaders among them when they arrived in Pennsylvania showed the same\r\ntypes. Furthermore, Doctor Jordan’s extensive reading of early documents\r\nrelating to them tends to confirm the belief that the present day\r\ndescendants represent the original types. Tall blonds are very rare\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nDoctor Noble knows some individuals with Nordic traits, but these were\r\nacquired by intermarriage with Anglo-Saxons. Most of these groups came\r\nfrom southern Germany, from Silesia on the east to the Palatinate on the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe following are Doctor Jordan’s notes:\r\n\r\nMoravians. They were located in Pennsylvania, at first in Bethlehem and\r\nlater in Nazareth. The land in Nazareth was purchased of Whitfield, the\r\npredestinarian Methodist.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian immigration was carefully supervised. The church either\r\nowned or chartered the vessels which brought over the immigrants.\r\nFrequently it was definitely arranged as to how many artisans of each\r\ntrade should come over so that they would prosper on arrival.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian immigration was small—about 500 up to 1750. Until about\r\n1840 the Moravian settlements were closed towns—no non-Moravians could\r\nbuy property.\r\n\r\nNot one quarter of the present Moravians are descendants of the early\r\nsettlers. The rest are converts or descendants of converts. A connection\r\nexists between the Moravians, Huss and his Protestant followers, and the\r\nWaldenses. A short résumé of this will be found in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_—under Huss and Moravians—from the world standpoint.\r\n\r\nMoravians migrated from Bohemia to Saxony and were protected by Count\r\nZinzendorf—a liberal Lutheran—and lived on his estates. He assisted in\r\ntheir migration to Pennsylvania. Some went to Georgia and later to\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSchwenkfelders. These were the followers of Kaspar Schwenkenfeld\r\n(1490–1561). See the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ for a short account. They\r\nformed a sect in Silesia which has persisted. In 1720 a commission of\r\nJesuits was sent to convert them by force. Most of them fled into Saxony\r\nand were protected by Count Zinzendorf. From thence they migrated to\r\nHolland, England and Pennsylvania. Frederick the Great, when he seized\r\nSilesia, protected those remaining there.\r\n\r\nUrsinus College, Collegeville, is Schwenkfelder. The sect is not large\r\nand was located in or around Montgomery County. Their migration to\r\nSaxony and also to Pennsylvania antedated that of the Moravians.\r\nGenerally speaking, they have been much more aggressive and vigorous\r\nthan the Moravians.\r\n\r\nThe Dunkards, Mennonites, Amish, and Seventh Day Baptists (Wissahickon\r\nand Ephrata, Pennsylvania), came from south Germany and the Palatinate.\r\n\r\nThe Harmony Society, small in numbers, the Lutherans and German\r\nReformed, came largely from south Germany and the Palatinate, but also\r\nfrom other parts of Germany. The Lutherans and the Reformed were the\r\nlarge sects in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nGermans from the Hudson valley migrated to Berks County around Reading.\r\nThe Swedes in New Jersey were almost exclusively below Philadelphia—from\r\nGloucester down the Delaware River. Before the Revolution there were\r\nabout 30,000 Germans in Pennsylvania, out of a total estimated\r\npopulation of 100,000 to 120,000.\r\n\r\n84 : 16. Scotch-Irish.

In this connection it is interesting to note that an early\r\nEgyptian king said almost the same concerning the negroes of his time.\r\nThe quotation is taken from Hall’s _Ancient History of the Near East_,\r\npp. 161–162, and is a translation of a portion of the manifesto of\r\nSenusert III, of the XIIth dynasty, which he caused to be set up at the\r\ntime of the Nubian wars: “Vigor is valiant, but cowardice is vile. He is\r\na coward who is vanquished on his own frontier, since the negro will\r\nfall prostrate at a word; answer him, and he retreats; if one is\r\nvigorous, he turns his back, retiring even when on the way to attack.\r\nBehold, these people have nothing terrible about them; they are feeble\r\nand insignificant; they have buttocks for hearts. I have seen it, even\r\nI, the majesty; it is no lie....”\r\n\r\n88 : 9. Barrett Wendell, _A Literary History of America_, chap. III.\r\n\r\n88 : 28.

I he discusses the Dorian conquest\r\nfrom p. 57 forward, and the Homeric-Mycenæan period (1600–1100 B. C.)\r\nfrom p. 20. A very interesting instance of the truth of the picture of\r\nMycenæan culture as drawn by Homer occurs on p. 50, where it is stated\r\nthat much described by the poet, even to small articles, has been\r\nunearthed during archæological investigations. “Although the poets who\r\ncomposed the Iliad and Odyssey probably did not live before the ninth\r\ncentury, they derived their matter from older lays.”\r\n\r\n99 : 27. Crete. For systems of Cretan writing see Sir Arthur J. Evans,\r\n_Cretan Pictographs and Pre-Phœnician Script_, _Further Discoveries of\r\nCretan and Ægean Script_, _Reports of Excavations at Cnossus_,\r\n_Prehistoric Tombs of Knossos_, and _Scripta Minoa_. That the aboriginal\r\n“Eteocretan” language existed until historic times is attested by the\r\ndiscoveries of later inscriptions belonging to the fifth and succeeding\r\ncenturies B. C., which were written in Greek letters at this time but in\r\nthe indigenous, undecipherable tongue. They are described by Comparetti,\r\n_Mon. Ant._, III, pp. 451 _seq._, and by R. S. Conway, 2, 3, especially\r\npp. 125 _seq._, in vol. VIII. In 1908 another discovery was made by the\r\nItalian Mission at Phæstus, of a clay disk with printed hieroglyphics\r\nwhich did not belong to the Cretan system of writing. It is supposed to\r\nhave come from Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nFor other discoveries in Crete and other authorities see R. M. Burrowes,\r\nC. H. and H. B. Dawes. On Cretan pottery see Sir Duncan Mackenzie, 2,\r\nand Sir Arthur Evans, 2. Sir Duncan Mackenzie also has a book on the\r\nCretan palaces. Bury, in his _History of Greece_, pp. 9 _seq._, gives a\r\nbrief description of Crete as revealed by archæologists. According to\r\nthem, the palaces of Cnossus and Phæstus were erected before 2100 B. C.,\r\nwhen Cretan civilization was well advanced.

At the beginning of this Eolithic period wood was used for\r\nclubs and probably as levers along with the chance flints. Perhaps it\r\nwas employed even earlier, but of course no remains would come down to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER II. PALEOLITHIC MAN\r\n\r\nFor the material in this chapter the authorities, such as Cartailhac,\r\nBoule, Breuil, Obermaier and Rutot are all given in Osborn, 1, together\r\nwith useful discussions of the evidence. In special instances additional\r\nsources are inserted here.\r\n\r\n105 : 17. Piltdown Man. See Charles Dawson, the discoverer, 1, 2 and 3.\r\nThere is a tremendous bibliography on the Piltdown Man.\r\n\r\n106 : 1. _The Jaw of the Piltdown Man_, Gerrit S. Miller. From a later\r\npaper by Mr. Miller (2) we quote the following from pp. 43–44:\r\n\r\n“The combined characters of the jaw, molars and skull were made the\r\nbasis of a genus Eoanthropus, placed in the family Hominidæ.... While\r\nthe brain case is human in structure, the jaw and teeth have not yet\r\nbeen shown to present any character diagnostic of man; the recognized\r\nfeatures in which they resemble human jaws and teeth are merely those\r\nwhich men and apes possess in common. On the other hand, the symphyseal\r\nregion of the jaw, the canine tooth and the molars are unlike those\r\nknown to occur in any race of men.... Until the combination of a human\r\nbrain case and nasal bones with an ape-like mandible, ape-like lower\r\nmolars and an ape-like upper canine has actually been seen in one\r\nanimal, the ordinary procedure of both zoology and paleontology would\r\nrefer each set of fragments to a member of the family which the\r\ncharacters indicate. The name Eoanthropus dawsoni has therefore been\r\nrestricted to the human elements of the original composite (Family\r\nHominidæ), and the name Pan vetus has been proposed for the animal\r\nrepresented by the jaw (Family Pongidæ).”\r\n\r\nSee also _The Dawn Man of Piltdown, England_, by W. K. Gregory. Ray\r\nLancaster has made some interesting observations and is the most recent\r\nauthority on this subject.\r\n\r\n106 : 14. On the Neanderthal Man see Osborn and his authorities.\r\n\r\n107 : 21. A note on p. 385 of Rice Holmes’s _Ancient Britain_ is useful\r\nin this connection. “MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy affirm that the\r\nNeanderthal race has left a permanent imprint on the population, and\r\nrefer to various skulls of the Neolithic and later periods which\r\nresemble more or less closely that of Neanderthal. Moreover, it is\r\ngenerally admitted that even at the present day a few individuals here\r\nand there belong to the same type. But it does not follow that these\r\npersons to whom Dr. Beddoe and M. Hamy refer were descended from men who\r\nlived in Britain in the Paleolithic age.”\r\n\r\nTaylor, _Origin of the Aryans_, mentions several famous men who had\r\ntypical Neanderthal skulls, among them Robert Bruce.\r\n\r\n108 : 1 _seq._ Beddoe, 4, pp. 265–266; Ripley, pp. 326–334, but\r\nespecially pp. 266, 330–331.\r\n\r\n108: 16. Alés Hrdlička, _The Most Ancient Skeletal Remains of Man_,\r\nconsiders the Neanderthal type extinct, as do Keith, _Antiquity of Man_,\r\n_passim_, and A. C. Haddon. Consult Barnard Davis, _Thesaurus\r\nCraniorum_, especially p. 70, and Beddoe, 2, as well as Osborn, 1, p.\r\n217.\r\n\r\n108 : 18. Firbolgs. See the note above to line 1; also Taylor, _Origin\r\nof the Aryans_, p. 78.\r\n\r\n109 : 8. Broca, according to Osborn, is responsible for this theory.\r\n\r\n109 : 17 _seq._ See pp. 329 _seq._ of Galton’s _Hereditary Genius_.\r\n\r\n110 : 8. In Dordogne, France, there are people who look as it is thought\r\nthe Cro-Magnons did. These modern people may belong to that type in the\r\nsame way that here and there people resembling the Neanderthals are\r\nstill found. In Dordogne these Cro-Magnon features are quite common, and\r\ndiffer markedly from those of other Frenchmen. For studies of this type\r\nsee Collignon, 1. For full discussions of the ancient Cro-Magnons see\r\nKeith, 1 and 2, and Osborn, 1.\r\n\r\n110 : 11. Dr. Charles B. Davenport, in correspondence, remarks: “There\r\ncan be no doubt that the prolific shall inherit the earth or the\r\nproletariat shall inherit the earth, which is etymologically the same\r\nthing. We see this law in action in Russia to-day.... Can we build a\r\nwall high enough around this country, so as to keep out these cheaper\r\nraces, or will it be only a feeble dam which will make the flood all the\r\nworse when it breaks? Or should we admit the four million picks and\r\nshovels which many of our capitalists are urging Congress to admit in\r\norder to secure what wealth we can for the moment, leaving it for our\r\ndescendants to abandon the country to the blacks, browns and yellows,\r\nand seek an asylum in New Zealand? I am inclined to think that the thing\r\nto do is to make better selection of immigrants, admitting them in\r\nfairly large numbers so long as we can sift out the defective strains.”\r\n\r\n111 : 20 _seq._ É. Cartailhac says, in _La France préhistorique_: “The\r\nrace of Cro-Magnon is well determined. There is no doubt about their\r\nhigh stature and Topinard is not the only one who believes that they\r\nwere blonds.” See also G. Retzius, 3. But he derives the Nordics from\r\nthem. On the other hand, the Dordogne people to-day are dark, and many\r\nanthropologists are inclined to the belief that the Cro-Magnons were\r\nbrunets, a theory in which the writer heartily concurs.\r\n\r\n112 : 1. L’Abbé H. Breuil, _Les subdivisions du paléolithique supérieur\r\net leur signification_, pp. 203–205. Other writers such as Nilsson and\r\nDawkins have also held this theory.\r\n\r\n112 : 21. One of the few references to the bare possibility of a\r\nMagdalenian dog occurs in Obermaier’s _El Hombre Fósil_, the footnote on\r\npp. 221 and 223. From this it appears that certain conclusions are drawn\r\nthat if the Alpera paintings are of late Magdalenian age, if certain\r\nnondescript animals in those paintings are intended for dogs and if\r\nthose dogs are meant to be in a state of domestication, then there can\r\nbe no doubt whatever that the dog was domesticated in Magdalenian times.\r\nBut Obermaier does not feel that this furnishes satisfactory proof.\r\n\r\n112 : 25–p. 113. Bow and Arrow. Obermaier, 1, chap. V, _The Upper\r\nPaleolithic_, p. 112, says: “The coarse stone implements of the lower\r\nPaleolithic no longer exist, being replaced by an industry of very fine\r\nflints and ... certain lances with points made of bone, horn or ivory,\r\nwhich were very generally used. The use of the bow is proved by certain\r\nrepresentations in mural pictures (_i. e._, the Archers of Alpera, etc.,\r\neastern Spain, Magdalenian; Archer of Laussel, France, Aurignacian).”\r\nSee the corresponding plates in chap. VII.\r\n\r\nOn p. 217 of chap. VII, _Quaternary Art_, there is a man depicted in the\r\npose of an archer. On p. 239 Obermaier says: “Among ... [the paintings\r\nof Alpera] are sketches of more than 70 human figures, ... 13 are shown\r\nin the act of shooting an arrow at other men or animals.”[6] On p. 241\r\nhe continues: “The paintings of eastern Spain of Quaternary age also\r\nshow archers.” A recent letter from the Abbé Henri Breuil says that the\r\nbow and arrow did not exist in France in Paleolithic times, and he is,\r\nof course, aware of the Laussel figure found by Lalanne and referred to\r\nby Obermaier as proof. Alpera is agreed by Obermaier to be of\r\nTardenoisian age, consequently of the transition period to the\r\nNeolithic. Beside Alpera, the only other instance of pictured bows and\r\narrows noted occurs at Calpatá, said to be of Upper Paleolithic age and\r\nCapsian industry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  If the Alpera paintings are of this (Magdalenian?) period, then the\r\n  bow certainly existed at this time, but there is reason to believe\r\n  that the paintings belong to a later epoch.\r\n\r\nSee Fig. 174, p. 353, of Osborn, 1, giving a large bison drawing in the\r\ncavern of Niaux on the Ariège, showing the supposed spear or arrowheads,\r\nattached to large shafts, which are represented as having pierced its\r\nside. On p. 354 Osborn says: “It is possible, although not probable,\r\nthat the bow was introduced at this time and that a less perfect flint\r\npoint, fastened to a shaft like an arrowhead, and projected with great\r\nvelocity and accuracy, proved to be far more effective than the\r\nspear.... From these drawings and symbols (Fig. 174), it would appear\r\nthat barbed weapons of some kind were used in the chase, but no barbed\r\nflints occur at any time in the Paleolithic, nor has any trace been\r\nfound of bone barbed arrowheads, or any direct evidence of the existence\r\nof the bow.” On p. 410: “Here [Cavern of Niaux] for the first time are\r\nrevealed the early Magdalenian methods of hunting the bison, for upon\r\ntheir flanks are clearly traced one or more arrow or spear heads with\r\nthe shafts still attached; the most positive proof of the use of the\r\narrow is the apparent termination of the wooden shaft in the feathers\r\nwhich are rudely represented in three of the drawings.”\r\n\r\n113 : 3. Osborn, p. 456: “The flint industry [of the Azilian] continues\r\nthe degeneration begun in the Magdalenian and exhibits a new life and\r\nimpulse only in the fashioning of extremely small or microlithic tools\r\nand weapons known as ‘Tardenoisian.’” See also pp. 465–475 for a more\r\ncomplete discussion and their distribution as traced by de Mortillet.\r\nAlso Breuil, 2, pp. 2–6, and 3, pp. 165–238, but especially pp. 232–233.\r\n\r\nOsborn continues, p. 450: “If it is true ... that Europe at the same\r\ntime became more densely forested, the chase may have become more\r\ndifficult and the Cro-Magnons may have begun to depend more and more\r\nupon the life of the streams and the art of fishing. It is generally\r\nagreed that the harpoons were chiefly used for fishing, and that many of\r\nthe microlithic flints, which now begin to appear more abundantly, may\r\nhave been attached to a shaft for the same purpose. We know that similar\r\nmicroliths were used as arrowpoints in pre-dynastic Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThe microliths may have been used on darts for bird hunting.\r\n\r\n113 : 21. See Osborn, pp. 333 _seq._, and in this book the note to p.\r\n143 : 13 on the Tripolje culture.\r\n\r\n115 : 9. Compare what Rice Holmes has to say on pp. 99–100 of his\r\n_Ancient Britain_.\r\n\r\n117 : 18. Maglemose. This culture was first found and described by G. F.\r\nL. Sarauw, in a work entitled _En Stenolden Boplads: Maglemose ved\r\nMullerup_. The same material is given in “Trouvaille fait dans le nord\r\nde l’Europe datant de la période de l’hiatus,” in the _Congrès\r\npréhistorique de France_. A site equivalent to the Maglemose in culture,\r\nbut discovered later, is described in “Une trouvaille de l’ancien âge de\r\nla pierre” (Braband), by MM. Thomsen and Jessen. See also Obermaier, 2,\r\npp. 467–469.\r\n\r\n117 : 23. The Abbé Breuil, _Les peintures rupestres d’Espagne_ (with\r\nSerrano Gomez and Cabre Aguilo), IV, “Les Abris del Bosque à Alpéra\r\n(Albacete)” says: “Other peoples known at present only from their\r\nindustries, were advancing toward the close of the Upper Paleolithic\r\nalong the northern and southern shores of the Baltic and persisted for\r\nan appreciable time before the arrival of the tribes introducing the\r\nearly Neolithic-Campignian culture which accumulated in the Kitchen\r\nMiddens along the same shores. Like the southern races of the\r\nAzilian-Tardenoisian times these northerly tribes were truly\r\nPre-Neolithic, ignorant of both agriculture and pottery; they brought\r\nwith them no domesticated animals excepting the dog, which is known at\r\nMugem, at Tourasse and at Oban, in northwestern Scotland.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               CHAPTER III. THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGES\r\n\r\n119: 1. See the Osborn tables. As evidence of far earlier dates of the\r\nNeolithic in the east we may quote Sir A. J. Evans, 2, p. 721. He\r\ncalculates that the earliest settlement at Knossos in Crete, which was\r\n_Neolithic_, is about 12,000 years old, for he assumes that in the\r\nwestern court of the palace the average rate of deposit was fairly\r\ncontinuous. Professor Montelius, in _L’Anthropologie_, t. XVII, p. 137,\r\nargues from the stratigraphy of finds at Susa that the beginning of the\r\nNeolithic Age in the east may be dated about 18,000 B. C.\r\n\r\n119: 6. See the note to p. 147.\r\n\r\n119: 15. Balkh. Balkh, in Afghanistan, was the capital of Bactria, the\r\nancient name of the country between the range of the Hindu Kush and the\r\nOxus, and is now for the most part a mass of ruins, situated on the\r\nright bank of the Balkh River. The antiquity and greatness of the place\r\nare recognized by the native populations who speak of it as the “Mother\r\nof Cities,” and it is certain that at a very early date it was the rival\r\nof Ecbatana, Nineveh, and Babylon.\r\n\r\nBactria was subjugated by Cyrus and from then on formed one of the\r\nsatrapies of the Persian Empire. Zaborowski, 1, p. 43, says: “After the\r\nconquests of Alexander there was founded a Greco-Bactrian kingdom ...\r\nwhich embraced Sogdiana, Bactria and Afghanistan. The Greco-Bactrian\r\nkings struck a quantity of coins. They bore a double legend, the one\r\nGreek, the other still called Bactrian, which is not Zend, nor even the\r\nlanguage really spoken in Bactria. It is a popular dialect derived from\r\nSanskrit.” Again on p. 185: “Zend has been called, and is still called,\r\nBactrian or Old Bactrian, it may be because Bactria has been conceived\r\nas the original country or an ancient place of sojourn of the Persians;\r\nit may be because Zoroaster, a Median Magus, had, according to a legend,\r\nfled to the Bactrians where he found protection under Prince Vishtaspa.\r\nEulogy of this prince is often incorporated in the sayings of\r\nZoroaster.”\r\n\r\nLater a new race appeared, tribes called Scythians by the Greeks,\r\namongst which the Tochari, identical with the Yuë-Chih of the Chinese,\r\nwere the most important. According to Chinese sources, they entered\r\nSogdiana in 159 B. C.; in 139 they conquered Bactria, and during the\r\nnext generation they had made an end to the Greek rule in eastern Iran.\r\nIn the middle of the first century B. C. the whole of eastern Iran and\r\nwestern India belonged to the great “Indo-Scythian” Empire. In the third\r\ncentury the Kushan dynasty began to decline; about 320 A. D. the Gupta\r\nEmpire was founded in India. In the fifth the Ephtalites, or “White\r\nHuns,” subjugated Bactria; then the Turks, about A. D. 560, overran the\r\ncountry north of the Oxus. In 1220 Jenghis Khan sacked Balkh and\r\nlevelled all buildings capable of defence, while Timur repeated this\r\ntreatment in the fourteenth century. Notwithstanding this, Marco Polo\r\ncould still, in the following century, describe it as “a noble city and\r\na great.”\r\n\r\nSee also Raphael Pumpelly, _Explorations in Turkestan_, where 10,000\r\nyears is said to be the age of the remains of early civilization. More\r\nmodern authorities, however, do not accept these ancient dates.\r\n\r\n119: 21.

This hill\r\nformed the battleground.... On reaching the lower slopes of the English\r\nposition the archers began to let fly their shafts, and not without\r\neffect, for as long as the shooting was at long range, there was little\r\nreply, since Harold had but few bowmen in his ranks, (the Fyrd, it is\r\nsaid, came to the fight with no defensive weapons but the shield, and\r\nwere ill-equipped, with javelins and instruments of husbandry turned to\r\nwarlike uses), and the abattis, whatever its length or height, would not\r\ngive complete protection to the English. But when the advance reached\r\ncloser quarters, it was met with a furious hail of missiles of all\r\nsorts—darts, lances, casting axes, and stone clubs such as William of\r\nPoictiers describes, and the Bayeux Tapestry portrays—rude weapons, more\r\nappropriate to the neolithic age.... Many a moral has been drawn from\r\nthis great fight.... Neither desperate courage, nor numbers that must\r\nhave been at least equal to those of the invader, could save from defeat\r\nan army which was composed in too great a proportion of untrained\r\ntroops, and which was behind the times in its organization.... But the\r\nEnglish stood by the customs of their ancestors, and, a few years\r\nbefore, Earl Ralph’s attempt to make the thegnhood learn cavalry tactics\r\n(see the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle), had been met by sullen resistance and\r\nhad no effect.”\r\n\r\n121 : 4.

Schenck, p. 190, says concerning Switzerland: “There were\r\nthree [cultural] stages, stone, bronze, and iron.... On the other hand,\r\nfrom the anthropological point of view, this subdivision can also be\r\nmade. In the first stage [Neolithic Lacustrian], we find only\r\nbrachycephalic crania; in the second there are an almost equal number of\r\nbrachycephalic and dolichocephalic; in the third there is a predominance\r\nof dolichocephalic” (that is, Schenck divides the Neolithic into three\r\nperiods according to skulls, and the last runs into the age\r\ntransitionary to bronze).\r\n\r\nSee also G. Hervé, _Les populations lacustres_, p. 140; His and\r\nRütimeyer, _Crania Helvetica_, pp. 12, 34, etc.; and the note on p. 275\r\nof Rice Holmes’s _Cæsar’s Conquest of Gaul_. Ripley gives useful and\r\nconcise discussions on pp. 120, 471, 488 and 501.\r\n\r\n121 : 19. See both Keller and Schenck for the numbers of dwellings.\r\n\r\n121 : 22. _There were, of course, the caves and rock shelters used\r\nduring a large part of the year, but probably no other regularly\r\nconstructed dwellings served as permanent, all-the-year-round places of\r\nabode prior to the lake dwellings, and it is doubtful if these were\r\ninhabited in winter. It is generally believed that the custom of\r\nbuilding pile villages arose from considerations of safety. This\r\nprotection would be absent when the lakes were frozen over, and at the\r\nsame time the huts would be exposed on all sides, including the floor,\r\nto the wintry blasts sweeping the lakes. They would in this way be\r\nrendered practically uninhabitable during the winter season._\r\n\r\nKeller declares that the same type of dwelling is found in the whole\r\ncircle of countries which were formerly Celtic. (Introduction, p. 2.)\r\nThe Crannoges of Scotland and Ireland continued in use until the age of\r\niron in those countries. In Switzerland the lake dwellings disappeared\r\nabout the first century (p. 7). The population was numerous (p. 432),\r\nlarge enough to have to depend upon cattle and agriculture (p. 479).\r\n\r\nThis type of dwelling is found from Ireland to Japan, and even in South\r\nAmerica. Many lake dwellings exist at the present day. The Welsh, Scotch\r\nand Irish Crannoges are related in structure to the European fascine\r\ntypes (Keller, p. 684 and Introduction). Others are built somewhat\r\ndifferently, and are, of course, of independent origin. An ancient site\r\nwas unearthed at Finsbury, on the outskirts of London not long since,\r\nwhere there used to be a marsh. The inhabitants of this lake-dwelling\r\nwere native outcasts during Romano-British times.\r\n\r\n121 : 26. See Schenck, and Keller, p. 6. On p. 140 of Keller we read:\r\n“The Pile Dwellings of eastern Switzerland ceased to exist before the\r\nbronze age or at its beginnings; those of western Switzerland came to\r\ntheir full development during this period.” On p. 37, describing the\r\nsettlement of Mooseedorfsee Keller says: “A very striking circumstance\r\nought to be mentioned, namely, that even heavy implements, such as stone\r\nchisels, grinding or sharpening stones, etc., were found quite high in\r\nthe relic bed, while lighter objects, such as those made out of bone,\r\nwere met with much deeper.” It is known that the Mooseedorfsee\r\nsettlement is very old. No metal has been found here, but a bone\r\narrowhead is described by Keller on p. 38. He remarks that the bones of\r\nvery large animals were uncommonly numerous. It seems as if the earlier\r\ninhabitants were users of bone rather than of stone implements.\r\n\r\n122 : 1. Herodotus, V, 16 describes them. He also is the source of our\r\ninformation regarding the keeping of cattle, although archæological\r\nfinds have proved the location of stables out on the platforms between\r\nthe houses. His interesting account is given herewith: “Their manner of\r\nliving is the following. Platforms supported upon tall piles stand in\r\nthe middle of the lake, which are approached from land by a single\r\nnarrow bridge. At the first the piles which bear up the platforms were\r\nfixed in their place by the whole body of the citizens, but since that\r\ntime the custom which has prevailed about fixing them is this: they are\r\nbrought from a hill called Orbêlus, and every man drives in three for\r\neach wife that he marries. Now the men all have many wives apiece; and\r\nthis is the way in which they live. Each has his own hut, wherein he\r\ndwells, upon one of the platforms, and each has also a trap door giving\r\naccess to the lake beneath; and their wont is to tie their baby children\r\nby the foot with a string, to save them from rolling into the water.\r\nThey feed their horses and their other beasts upon fish, which abound in\r\nthe lake to such a degree that a man has only to open his trap door and\r\nto let down a basket by a rope into the water and then to wait a very\r\nshort time, when he draws it up quite full of them. The fish are of two\r\nkinds, which they call the paprax and the tilon.”\r\n\r\n122 : 3. In the Introduction, p. 2, and elsewhere Keller says regarding\r\ncattle: “Cattle were kept, not on land, as in the Terramara region, but\r\non the platforms themselves, out in the lakes. Many charred remains of\r\nstables and stable refuse have been taken from the lakes, but only from\r\ncertain parts of the sites, between those of the houses.” See also\r\nSchenck, p. 188.\r\n\r\nRice Holmes, pp. 89–90 of _Ancient Britain_, says of that country that\r\nagriculture was limited in the Neolithic, but flourished in the Bronze\r\nAge.\r\n\r\n122 : 14.

Amber. Tacitus, _Germania_: “They [the tribes of the Æstii]\r\nransack the sea also and are the only people who gather in the shallows\r\nand on the shore itself the amber which they call in their tongue\r\n‘glæsum.’ Nor have they, being barbarians, inquired or learned what\r\nsubstance or process produces it; nay, it lay there long among the rest\r\nof the flotsam and jetsam of the sea, until Roman luxury gave it a name.\r\nTo the natives it is useless; it is gathered crude, it is forwarded to\r\nRome unshaped; they are astonished to be paid for it. Yet you may infer\r\nthat it is the exudation of trees: certain creeping and even winged\r\ncreatures are continually found embedded; they have been entangled in\r\nits liquid form and as the material hardens, are imprisoned. I should\r\nsuppose, therefore, that, just as in the secluded places of the East,\r\nwhere frankincense and balsam are exuded, so in the islands and lands of\r\nthe West, there are groves and glades more than ordinarily luxuriant,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAmber, if rubbed, has magnetic qualities and develops electricity. Our\r\nword “electricity” is derived from its Greek name, “electron.” Tacitus\r\nsays: “If you try the qualities of amber by setting fire to it, it\r\nkindles like a torch and soon dissolves into something like pitch and\r\nresin.”\r\n\r\n125 : 13. Gowland, _Metals in Antiquity_, pp. 236, 252 _seq._\r\n\r\n125 : 15 _seq._ Copper. Reisner’s opinion that the pre-dynastic\r\nEgyptians invented the use of copper (_Naga-ed-Dêr_, I, p. 134) which is\r\nfollowed by Elliot Smith (_Ancient Egyptians_, p. 3), is not the view\r\nheld by all scholars. Hall believes that the knowledge of the use of\r\nmetal came to the prehistoric southern Egyptians (_Ancient History of\r\nthe Near East_, p. 90), toward the end of the pre-dynastic age from the\r\nnorth. But he counts the Mount Sinai and Cyprus deposits as northern\r\ncentres of origin from which a knowledge of the working of the metal\r\nradiated.\r\n\r\nThe mines of the Sinaitic peninsula were worked for copper at the time\r\nof Seneferu, about 3733 B. C., and probably much earlier (Gowland, p.\r\n245, and elsewhere), “but long before the actual mining operations were\r\ncarried on, how long it is impossible to say, the metal must have been\r\nobtained by primitive methods from the surface ore. It is hence not\r\nunreasonable to assume that at least as early as about 5000 B. C. the\r\nmetal copper was known and in use in Egypt.” The same writer believes\r\n“that an earlier date than 5000 B. C. should be assigned to the first\r\nuse of copper in the Chaldean region.” In this he bases himself on the\r\ndiscovery of copper figures associated with bricks and tablets bearing\r\nthe name of King Ur-Nina (about 4500 B. C.), and the fact that the upper\r\nTigris region is known to contain rich deposits of the mineral. Jastrow,\r\nJr., assigns the date of 3000 B. C. to Ur-Nina, which may be more\r\ncorrect. Gowland dates copper in Cyprus at 2500 B. C., or even 3000,\r\njudging by the finds at Crete dated 2500 B. C. In the Troad he thinks it\r\nwas used not later than in Cyprus. For China the date is unknown, but if\r\nwe accept 2205, given in the Chinese annals as the time when the nine\r\nbronze caldrons were cast, which are often mentioned in the historical\r\nrecords, then copper may have been in use as early as 3000, or even\r\nearlier. De Morgan dates copper at 4400 B. C. in Egypt, where it was\r\nfound in the supposed tomb of Menes.\r\n\r\nSee also Lord Avebury, _Prehistoric Times_, pp. 71–72, who gives 3730\r\nfor copper-working in Sinai, and its first appearance about 5000 B. C.\r\nMontelius, 1, p. 380, gives copper in Cyprus as about 2500 B. C., hardly\r\n3000; and for Egypt 5000; he regards it as having been known in Babylon\r\nat about the same time. Breasted, _Ancient Times_, assigns the date of\r\nthe earliest copper as at least 4000 in Egypt.\r\n\r\n125 : 27. Eduard Meyer, 1, p. 41. But _cf._ Reisner, _Naga-ed-Dêr_, I,\r\np. 126, note 3. Also Hall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n126 : 1. Elliot Smith, 1, p. 8: “Most serious scholars who concern\r\nthemselves with the problems of the ancient history of Egypt and\r\nBabylonia have now abandoned these inflated estimates of the lengths of\r\nthe historical periods in the two empires; and it is now generally\r\nadmitted that Meyer’s estimate of 3400±100 B. C. is a close\r\napproximation to the date of the union of Upper and Lower Egypt and that\r\nthe blending of Semitic and Sumerian cultures in Babylonia took place\r\nshortly after the time of this event in the Nile valley.” See also Hall,\r\n_Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 3.\r\n\r\n126 : 7. Bronze. Rice Holmes, 1, p. 125: “The oldest piece of bronze\r\nthat has yet been dated was found at Medûm, in Egypt, and is supposed to\r\nhave been cast about 3700 B. C. But the metal may have been worked even\r\nearlier in other lands; for a bronze statuette and a bronze vase, which\r\nwere made twenty-five centuries before our era have been obtained from\r\nMesopotamia and the craft must have passed through many stages before\r\nsuch objects could have been produced. Yet it would be rash to infer\r\nthat either the Babylonians or the Egyptians invented bronze for neither\r\nin Egypt nor in Babylonia is there any tin. The old theory that it was a\r\nresult of Phœnician commerce with Britain has long been abandoned and\r\nBritish bronze implements are so different from those of Norway and\r\nSweden, Denmark and Hungary, that it cannot have been derived from any\r\nof these countries. German influence was felt at a comparatively late\r\nperiod, but from first to last British bronze culture was closely\r\nconnected with that of Gaul and through Gaul with that of Italy.”\r\n\r\n126 : 9. Gowland, p. 243: “It has been frequently stated that the alloy\r\nused by the men of the Bronze Age generally consists of copper and tin\r\nin the proportions of 9 to 1. I have hence compared the analyses which\r\nhave been published with the following results:\r\n\r\n               EARLY WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS. 57 ANALYSES\r\n\r\n         In 25   the tin ranges from about 8 to 11 per cent.\r\n         „   6      „   „    „     „     „  11  „ 13  „   „\r\n         „  26      „   „    „     „     „   3  „  8  „   „\r\n\r\n\r\n             LATER PALSTAVES AND SOCKETED AXES. 15 ANALYSES\r\n\r\n         In 13 the tin ranges from about 4.3 to 13.1 per cent.\r\n         „   2          „   „  was about 18.3 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SPEAR AND LANCE HEADS\r\n\r\n         In  5 the tin ranges from about 11.3 to 15.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    STILL LATER. SWORDS. 33 ANALYSES\r\n\r\n         In 14   the tin ranges from about 8 to 11 per cent.\r\n         „  12      „   „    „      „    „  12  „ 18  „   „\r\n         „   7          „   „  is less than 9 per cent.\r\n\r\n“It is obvious, therefore, that these statements do not accurately\r\nrepresent the facts. And if we consider the different uses to which the\r\nimplements or weapons were put, it is evident that no single alloy could\r\nbe equally suitable for all.... It is worthy of note that these\r\nproportions (_i. e._, different hardnesses for different implements)\r\nappear to have been frequently attained, and for this the men of the\r\nlater Bronze Age are deserving of great credit as metallurgists and\r\nworkers in metal.”\r\n\r\nOn the percentages of tin with copper for bronze see also Montelius, 1,\r\npp. 448 _seq._\r\n\r\n126 : 12. Schenck, p. 241, describes a copper axe exactly like those of\r\npolished stone, and another of bronze, of very primitive pattern,\r\nshowing that these were copied from the earlier stone models.\r\n\r\nSome authorities think that iron, in Egypt at least, came in about the\r\nsame time as bronze, or even earlier. Certain peoples missed altogether\r\none or another of these stages, as the absence of remains indicates. For\r\ninstance, the central Africans had, as far as is known, no bronze age,\r\nbut passed directly from the use of stone to that of iron. (See Rice\r\nHolmes, _Ancient Britain_, p. 123.) See the notes to p. 129 on the value\r\nof iron. Occasional implements of any material better than that\r\nordinarily in use, which had been introduced by trade or acquired by\r\nfighting, were very highly prized. Any books on primitive peoples\r\ncontain references to the value of such “foreign tools.”\r\n\r\n126 : 24. Diodorus Siculus, V. Consult _Crania Britannica_, by Davis and\r\nThurnam, the chapter on the “Historical Ethnology of Britain,” for\r\nevidence that the Phœnicians did have intercourse with Britain. For a\r\nfull discussion of this disputed question see pp. 483–514 in Rice\r\nHolmes’s _Ancient Britain_. Herodotus and other early writers allude to\r\nthe fleets of the Phœnicians, and of course the voyage of Pythias about\r\nthe last half of the fourth century B. C. was undertaken to discover the\r\nsource of the Phœnician tin. See Holmes’s _Britain_, pp. 217–226;\r\nD’Arbois de Jubainville, _Les premiers habitants de l’Europe_, vol. I,\r\nchap.

Elliot Smith, _Ancient Mariners_, on the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\nOn pp. 251–252 of _Ancient Britain_, Rice Holmes makes the suggestion\r\nthat the export of tin from Britain may have died down by Roman times.\r\n\r\n127 : 9 _seq._ G. Elliot Smith, 1, p. 178, and map 3. Deniker, 2, p.\r\n315, says: “It is generally admitted that the ancient Bronze Age\r\ncorresponds with the ‘Ægean Civilization’ which flourished among the\r\npeoples inhabiting, between the thirtieth and twentieth centuries B. C.,\r\nSwitzerland, the north of Italy, the basin of the Danube, the Balkan\r\npeninsula, a part of Anatolia, and lastly, Cyprus. It gave rise, between\r\n1700 and 1100 B. C., to the ‘Mycenæan Civilization,’ of which the\r\nfavorite ornamental design is the spiral.”\r\n\r\nMyers, in _Ancient History_, pp. 134–135, states that in Crete the metal\r\ndevelopment began as early, at least, as 3000 B. C., and was at its\r\nheight in the island about 1600 or 1500 B. C. Articles of Cretan\r\nhandiwork found in Egypt point to intercourse with that country as early\r\nas the sixth dynasty, which he makes about 2500 B. C. See also G.

They do not agree on the date of this dynasty. See also Rice\r\nHolmes (_ibid._, p. 125), and Breasted, 3, p. 108. Montelius assigns\r\n2100 B.

Beddoe, 4, p. 15; Fleure and James, pp.\r\n128–129, 135, 139; Rice Holmes, 1, p. 432; Ripley, pp. 302–303;\r\nAbercromby, pp. 111 _seq._; Crawford, pp. 184 _seq._ But Fleure and\r\nJames say, p. 138, that other Alpines without brow ridges are to be\r\nfound at the present time in considerable numbers on the east coast of\r\nIreland. Ripley’s strong assertion that no Alpines have remained in the\r\nBritish Isles has been proved by more recent study to require\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\n128 : 17. See in this connection Fleure and James, p. 127.\r\n\r\n128 : 26. _Cf._ Elliot Smith, 1, pp. 20–21, 163, 181; Peet, 2; Reisner,\r\n_Early Dynastic Cemeteries of Naga-ed-Dêr_; and Rice Holmes, 1, p. 65\r\n_seq._\r\n\r\n129 : 2–8. The megaliths were not erected by Alpines, for there are\r\npractically none in central Europe, according to Keane, _Ethnology_, pp.\r\n135–136, and Dr. Robert Munro, in a discussion published in the _Jour.\r\nRoy. Anth. Inst._, 1889–1890, p. 65. On the other hand, Peet, 1, pp. 39,\r\n64, says they are being discovered in the interior—a few in Germany. He\r\ndoes not mention bronze among the finds in the megaliths of France, but\r\nthere was a little gold. Bronze was, however, found in Spain. Consult\r\nFleure and James, pp. 128 _seq._; Rice Holmes, 2, pp. 8–9; and, for an\r\nexhaustive archæological study, Déchellette, _Manuel d’archéologie_,\r\nvol. I, chap. III, especially paragraph v, pp. 393 _seq._, for dolmens\r\nin Brittany. Concerning the contents of these we may quote the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“Polished hatchets, often enough of rare stone, beads from necklaces,\r\nand pendants of Callais or of divers materials, implements of flint,\r\nknives, arrow points which are wing-shaped, scrapers, nodules, grinding\r\nstones, pottery, vases, grains of baked earth, some rare jewels of gold,\r\ncollars and bracelets, such is, in general, the composition of the\r\ncontents of the neolithic dolmens of Brittany, contents different, as we\r\nshall see, from those of the sepulchres of the Bronze Age in the same\r\nregion. These vast Armorican crypts belong certainly to the end of the\r\nNeolithic period, in spite of the absence of copper, the habitual\r\nforerunner of bronze objects. The smallness of the crypt, the size of\r\nthe tumulus, the mixture of construction in huge blocks and in walls\r\nseem to indicate, as M. Cartailhac has observed, a more recent age than\r\nthat of ordinary dolmens. In the pure Bronze Age the monolithic supports\r\nare replaced by the walls of unmortared stones.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, we shall see that there have been found in certain covered\r\nalleys in Brittany, pottery of a very characteristic type called\r\ncalciform vases, pottery belonging in the south of France and southern\r\nEurope with the first objects of copper and bronze. Jewels of gold\r\nconfirm, on the other hand, these chronological determinations.” On p.\r\n397: “The dolmen sepulchres of the Bronze Age in Brittany, and notably\r\nin Finisterre, are distinguished more often by the type of their\r\nconstruction from those of the Stone Age.”\r\n\r\n“The dolmens of Normandy and Isle de France contain some stone objects,\r\nfragments of vases, and numerous debris of human skeletons.” The end of\r\nthe pure Neolithic is the date of the megaliths in Armorica, as we read\r\non p. 407. The first metals, imported from the south, penetrated into\r\nnorthern Gaul a little later than in the southern provinces. That is why\r\ncertain typical objects of the end of the pure Neolithic in Armorica,\r\nsuch as Callais and the calciform vases, are associated with the first\r\nobjects of copper or bronze in the funerary crypts of Provence and\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nG. Elliot Smith and W. H. R. Rivers claim that there is a close\r\nconnection throughout the eastern hemisphere between the distribution of\r\nmegalithic monuments and either ocean or fresh-water pearls, but this\r\nappears to the author to be far-fetched. Two very recent articles\r\ndealing with megaliths are “Anthropology and Our Older Histories,” by\r\nFleure and Winstanley, and “The Menhirs of Madagascar,” by A. L. Lewis.\r\n\r\n129 : 8.

Some authorities think that iron in Egypt came\r\nin about the same time as bronze, or even earlier. A piece of worked\r\niron was found in the Great Pyramid, to which a date of about 3500 B. C.\r\nhas been assigned. But, according to the archæological investigations of\r\nProfessor Flinders Petrie, iron came into general use only about 800 B.\r\nC.\r\n\r\nMyres, in _The Dawn of History_, is quoted from p. 60 for the following\r\nneat summary, although any of the authorities on Egypt, such as Petrie,\r\nMaspero, Hall, Breasted, Elliot Smith, Reisner, Meyer, etc., should be\r\nconsulted as original investigators: “The presence of iron, rare though\r\nit is, as far back as the first dynasty, puts Egypt into a position\r\nwhich is unique among metal-using lands; for, apart from these rare, but\r\nquite indisputable finds, Egypt remains for thousands of years a\r\nbronze-using, and for long, a merely copper-using, country.... In Egypt\r\niron was known as a rarity, worn as a charm and an ornament, and even\r\nused, when it could be gotten ready made, as an implement; and it does\r\nnot seem to have been worked in the country, and probably its source was\r\nunknown to the Egyptians. In historic times they still called it the\r\n‘metal of heaven’ as if they obtained it from meteorites; and it looks\r\nat present as though their earliest knowledge of it was from the south;\r\nfor central Africa seems to have had no bronze age but direct and\r\nancient transition from stone to iron weapons. Yet when they conquered\r\nSyria in the sixteenth century, they found it in regular use and\r\nreceived it in tribute. At home, however, they had no real introduction\r\nto an ‘Age of Iron’ until they met an Assyrian army in 668 B. C. and\r\nbegan to be exploited by Greeks from over sea.” In this connection see\r\nalso Ridgeway, _The Early Age of Greece_, pp. 613–614. The same author,\r\npp. 154 _seq._, discusses the value of iron in these early times.\r\n\r\nDeniker, p. 315 of his _Races of Man_, says Italy had iron as early as\r\n1200 B. C.\r\n\r\nMontelius assigns 1100 for iron in Etruria.\r\n\r\n129 : 19. Hallstatt iron culture. See Baron von Sacken, _Das Grabfeld\r\nvon Hallstatt_; Dr. Moritz Hoernes, _Die Hallstattperiode_; Bertrand and\r\nSalomon Reinach, _Les Celts dans les vallées du Pô et du Danube_; and\r\nRidgeway, _The Early Age of Greece_, pp. 407–480 and 594 _seq._ There is\r\na brief summary by Ridgeway which it will serve to quote: “Everywhere\r\nelse the change from iron weapons to bronze is immediate but at\r\nHallstatt iron is seen gradually superseding bronze, first for ornament,\r\nthen for edging cutting implements, then replacing fully the old bronze\r\ntypes and finally taking new forms of its own. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the use of iron first developed in the Hallstatt area and that\r\nthence it spread southwards into Italy, Greece, the Ægean, Egypt and\r\nAsia, and northwards and westwards in Europe. At Noreia, which gave its\r\nname to Noricum, less than forty miles from Hallstatt, were the most\r\nfamous iron mines of antiquity, which produced the Noric swords so\r\nprized and dreaded by the Romans. (See Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, XXXIV, 145;\r\nHorace, _Epod._, 17 : 71.) This iron needed no tempering and the Celts\r\nhad found it ready smelted by nature just as the Eskimos had learned of\r\nthemselves to use telluric iron embedded in basalt.... The Hallstatt\r\nculture is that of the Homeric Achæans (see Ridgeway, _Early Age of\r\nGreece_, pp. 407 _seq._), but as the brooch (along with iron, cremation\r\nof the dead, the round shield and the geometric ornament), passed down\r\ninto Greece from central Europe, and as brooches are found in the lower\r\ntown at Mycenæ, 1350 B. C., they must have been invented long before\r\nthat date in central Europe. But as they are found here in the late\r\nbronze and early iron age, the early iron culture of Hallstatt must have\r\noriginated long before 1350 B. C., a conclusion in accordance with the\r\nabsence of silver at Hallstatt itself.”\r\n\r\nKeller, p. 160, describes an iron sword modelled after the same pattern\r\nas those of bronze; Schenck, p. 341, mentions a copper axe exactly like\r\nthose of stone, and another of bronze of very primitive pattern. These\r\nand numerous other examples show the gradual growth of each age.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted date for Hallstatt is about 900 or 1000 B. C.\r\nEven Rice Holmes approves of this. (See 2, p. 9.) But if we believe that\r\niron spread from Hallstatt, and it was in Etruria at 1200–1100 B. C.,\r\nand in Greece, in the form of swords like those of Hallstatt, at 1400 B.\r\nC. (according to Ridgeway), together with pins and various other objects\r\nwhich originated in the Tyrol, it is certainly very conservative to\r\nplace the appearance of iron in Austria at 1500 B. C. Iron weapons were\r\nfound in the remains of Troy from the war of 1184 B. C. See Ridgeway,\r\n_op. cit._, and Lartiaux, p. 179.\r\n\r\nWe may quote from Hoernes as follows regarding the dates: “The temporal\r\nlimits of the Hallstatt period are uncertain, according to the districts\r\nwhich one includes and the phenomena which one considers. It is now\r\nknown that the Hallstatt relics for the most part belong to the first\r\nhalf of the last millennium B. C. But while some assign these relics as\r\nfrom the time of perhaps 1200 to perhaps 500, others are satisfied with\r\nthe period from 900 to 400, or bring them even farther forward. It is\r\ncertain that one must differentiate in these questions between the west\r\nand the east of the Hallstatt culture areas; in the one the particular\r\nHallstatt forms would come nearer to the close than in the other. One or\r\nperhaps more centuries lie between the first appearance of the La Tène\r\nforms in Western Germany and in the eastern Alps. Also the beginning\r\nvaries according to the locality and the criteria which one takes for a\r\nguide, that is to say, according to whether the phenomena of the time\r\nabout 1000 B. C. are considered as belonging still in the pure Bronze\r\nAge, to a transition period, or indeed to the first Iron Age.”\r\n\r\n129 : 26. Ridgeway, speaking of the Achæans, says: “They brought with\r\nthem iron which they used for their long swords and cutting\r\nimplements.... The culture of the Homeric Achæans” (these are dated\r\nabout 1000 B. C., about the time of the Dorians, according to Bury, p.\r\n57) “corresponds to a large extent with that of the early Iron Age of\r\nthe Upper Danube (Hallstatt) and to the early Iron Age of Upper Italy\r\n(Villanova).”\r\n\r\nMyres, _Dawn of History_, p. 175, says that there was a gradual\r\nintroduction of iron, first for tools and then for weapons. It had been\r\nknown as “precious metal” in the Ægean since the late Minoan third\r\nperiod, or even the late Minoan second period, which is usually dated\r\nwith the XVIIIth Egyptian dynasty as about 1500–1350. Most other\r\nwriters, however, including Bury, p. 57, Myers, _Anc. Hist._, p. 136,\r\nand Deniker, _Races of Man_, p. 315, ascribe the general use of iron to\r\na much later invasion, namely that of the Dorians, about 1100 B. C.\r\n\r\n129 : 29. Iron swords of the Nordics. Ridgeway, 1, pp. 407 _seq._:\r\n“Their chief weapon was a long iron sword; with trenchant strokes\r\ndelivered by these long swords the Celts had dealt destruction to their\r\nfoes on many a field. They used not the thrust, as did the Greeks and\r\nRomans of the classical period. This is put beyond doubt by Polybius\r\n(II, 30) who in his account of the great defeat suffered by the combined\r\ntribes of Transalpine Gæsatæ, Insubres, Boii and Taurisci, when they\r\ninvaded Italy in 225 B. C., tells us that the Romans had the advantage\r\nin arms ‘for the Gallic sword can only deliver a cut but cannot thrust.’\r\nAgain in his account of the great victory gained over the Insubres by\r\nthe Romans in 223 B. C., the same historian tells us that the defeat of\r\nthe Celts was due to the fact that their long iron swords easily bent,\r\nand could only give one downward cut with any effect, but that after\r\nthis the edges got so turned and the blades so bent, that unless they\r\nhad time to straighten them out with the foot against the ground, they\r\ncould not deliver a second blow.\r\n\r\n“‘When the Celts had rendered their swords useless by the first blows\r\ndelivered on the spears the Romans closed with them and rendered them\r\nquite helpless by preventing them from raising their hands to strike\r\nwith their swords, which is their peculiar and only stroke, because\r\ntheir blade has no point. The Romans, on the contrary, having excellent\r\npoints to their swords, used them not to cut but to thrust; and by thus\r\nrepeatedly smiting the breasts and faces of the enemy, they eventually\r\nkilled the greater number of them.’ (II, 33 and III.)”\r\n\r\nFurther evidence in support of our contention that iron was in use much\r\nearlier than is generally admitted, comes from an unexpected quarter. J.\r\nN. Svoronos, in a recent book on ancient Greek coinage, entitled\r\n_L’Hellénism primitif de la Macédoine, prouvé par la numismatique_, p.\r\n171, remarks: “In the first place, indeed, it is forgotten that some of\r\nthis information, that which is derived from people of ‘mythical’ times,\r\ncan be referred not only to the invention of the first money struck in\r\nprecious metal (gold, electrum, or silver), but even to obelisks of\r\niron, or to cast plinths in the form of copper axes, which, of a\r\ndetermined weight, and legally guaranteed by the state, constituted,\r\nalready before the XVth century, as we positively know at the present\r\ntime, the first legal money.”\r\n\r\n130 : 2.

XIII;\r\nSteenstrup, _Normannerne_.\r\n\r\n130 : 4. “Furor Normanorum.” On account of the suffering inflicted by\r\nthe Vikings and other northern raiders in Europe, a special prayer, _A\r\nfurore Normanorum libera nos_ was inserted in some of the litanies of\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n130 : 5. Rome was sacked by Alaric in 410 A. D., and during the forty\r\nyears following the German tribes seized the greater part of the Roman\r\nprovinces and established in them what are known as the Barbarian\r\nKingdoms.

The discovery of the Alpine type\r\nwas the work of Von Baer.\r\n\r\n130 : 24. The Iron Age in western Europe. Deniker, 2, p. 315, says: “So\r\nalso, according to Montelius, the introduction of iron dates only from\r\nthe fifth or third century B. C. in Sweden, while Italy was acquainted\r\nwith this metal as far back as the twelfth century B. C. The\r\ncivilization of the ‘iron age,’ distributed over two periods, according\r\nto the excavations made in the stations of Hallstatt (Austria) and La\r\nTène (Switzerland), must have been imported from central Europe into\r\nGreece through Illyria. The importation corresponds perhaps with the\r\nDorian invasion of the Peloponnesus.... The Hallstattian civilization\r\nflourished chiefly in Carinthia, southern Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia,\r\nSilesia, Bosnia, the southeast of France and southern Italy (the\r\npre-Etruscan age of Montelius). The period which followed, called the\r\nsecond, or iron age or the La Tène period, was prolonged until the first\r\ncentury B. C. in France, Bohemia and England. In Scandinavian countries\r\nthe _first iron age_ lasted until the sixth century, and the _second\r\niron age_ until the tenth century A. D.” Referring to the La Tène period\r\nin a footnote, Deniker says: “This term, first used in Germany, is\r\naccepted by almost all men of science. The La Tène period corresponds\r\npretty nearly with the ‘Âge Marmien’ of French archæologists and the\r\n‘Late Celtic’ of English archæologists. _Cf._ M. Hoernes, _Urgeschichte\r\nd. Mensch._, chapters VIII and IX.”\r\n\r\nRice Holmes, 1, p. 231, remarks: “Iron in Britain is hardly older than\r\n500 B. C. (_i. e._ the earliest products of the British iron age were\r\ntraded in. See p. 229). In Gaul the Hallstatt period is believed to have\r\nlasted from about 800 to about 400 B. C.” On p. 126: “It is certain that\r\nin the southeastern districts iron tools began to be used not later than\r\nthe fourth century B. C.”\r\n\r\nSee also Sir John Evans, _Ancient Bronze Implements_, pp. 470–472.\r\nConsult especially Déchellette, _Manuel d’archéologie_, t.

THE ALPINE RACE\r\n\r\n134 : 1. There seem to have been at least three distinct types of\r\nAlpines, one with a broad head and developed occiput typical of western\r\nEurope, a second with a flat occiput and a high crown, represented by\r\nsuch peoples as the Armenoids of Asia Minor, and a third, of which\r\nlittle notice has been taken, except by such men as Zaborowski (2) and\r\nFleure and James, pp. 137 _seq._ This third type is encountered here and\r\nthere in nests which “stretch at least from southern Italy to Ireland,\r\nby way of the Straits of Gibraltar and across France by the dolmen\r\nline.” Fleure and James may be quoted for the following discussion.\r\n“Questions naturally arise as to the homologies of this type, and its\r\ndistribution beyond the line here mentioned. If we had the type in\r\nBritain, by itself, we should be inclined to connect it with the general\r\npopulation of Central Europe, the dark, broad-headed Alpine type. We\r\nshould, however, retain a little hesitation about this, as our type is\r\nsometimes of extraordinary strength of build and, while often fairly\r\nshort, it is occasionally outstandingly tall; moreover, the hair is\r\nfrequently quite black, and this is not on the whole an Alpine\r\ncharacter. But, when we note the coastal distribution of this type, our\r\nhesitation is much increased, for the Alpine type has spread typically\r\nalong the mountain flanks and its characteristic rarity in Britain is\r\nevidence of how little it has followed the sea.\r\n\r\n“We cannot but wonder also whether what Deniker calls the\r\nAtlanto-Mediterranean type is not a result of averaging these dark\r\nbroad-heads with the true Mediterranean type.\r\n\r\n“Seeking further distributional evidence, we find that the dark\r\nbroad-heads are highly characteristic of Dalmatia and may be an\r\nold-established stock, but it would appear that this region is famous\r\nfor the height of the heads there, and our type is not specially\r\nhigh-headed. Broad-head brunets do, however, occur farther east in Asia\r\nMinor, the Ægean, and Crete, for example. Many are certainly\r\nhypsicephalic, but in others it seems that the brow and head are\r\nmoderate and the forehead rather rectangular, as in our type....\r\n\r\n“It is interesting that there should be evidence of our dark broad-heads\r\nbeyond the Irish end of the line now discussed, the line of intercourse\r\nwhich Déchellette thinks must be older than the Bronze Age. The chief\r\nevidences for the type beyond Ireland are:\r\n\r\n“1. Ripley (p. 309) shows that a dark, broad-headed element is present\r\nin Shetland, West Caithness, and East Sutherland. This is sometimes\r\ncalled the Old Black Breed.\r\n\r\n“2. Arbo finds the coast and external openings of the more southerly\r\nNorwegian fjords have a broad-headed population, whereas the inner ends\r\nof the fjords and the interior are more dolichocephalic. The broad-heads\r\nstretch from Trondhjemsfjord southward, and from their exclusively\r\ncoastwise distribution he supposes them to have come across from the\r\nBritish Isles.\r\n\r\n“The population is darker than the rest of Norway and its area of\r\ndistribution, as Dr. Stuart Mackintosh has kindly pointed out to us, is,\r\nlike that of the same type in the British Isles, characterized by a\r\npelagic climate.”\r\n\r\nVon Luschan has fully discussed the Armenoid type in his _Early\r\nInhabitants of Western Asia_, and with E. Petersen, in _Reisen in\r\nLykien, Milyas, und Kibyratis_. A special study was made by Chantre in\r\nhis _Recherches anthropologiques dans l’Asie occidentale_.\r\n\r\nThe first type, then, the western European, has a short, thick stature,\r\nround head, and rather light pigmentation; the second, Armenoid, a\r\nrather tall stature, square, high head, flat occiput, and dark\r\npigmentation. The third, the Old Black Breed, is rather small and dark.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these we have a fourth type, which has been called the\r\nBronze Age race, or, better, the Beaker Maker type (Borreby). This has\r\nbeen discussed by Greenwell and Rolleston, Beddoe, and Keith, especially\r\nas to their possible survivors at the present day; by Abercromby, in\r\n_Bronze Age Pottery_; by Crawford, _The Distribution of Early Bronze Age\r\nSettlements in Britain_; and by Peake, in a discussion of the last work\r\nin the same number of the _Geographical Journal_. Fleure and James\r\ndescribe it also. See the note to p. 138 : 1 of this book.\r\n\r\nFurther anthropological studies may simplify the problem somewhat, but\r\nthe author is now inclined to believe that the above-mentioned third\r\nbrachycephalic type, the “Old Black Breed,” represents the survivors of\r\nthe earliest waves of the round-head invasion—in Britain antedating the\r\narrival of the Neolithic Mediterraneans, while the first type mentioned\r\nabove represents the descendants of the last great Alpine expansion.\r\nThis type in southern Germany has been so thoroughly Nordicized in\r\npigmentation that these blond South Germans are sometimes discussed as\r\nthough they were a distinct Alpine subspecies. The type is scantily\r\nrepresented in England, and when found may be partly attributed to\r\necclesiastics and other retainers brought over by the Normans.\r\n\r\nThe second of the above types, the Armenoids, are virtually absent from\r\nEurope, and seem to be characteristic of eastern Anatolia and the\r\nimmediately adjacent regions.\r\n\r\nThe author regards the fourth, Borreby or Beaker Maker type of tall,\r\nround heads as distinct from the three preceding types. The distribution\r\nof their remains would indicate they entered Britain from the northeast.\r\nWe have no clew as to their origin. A similar type is found in the\r\nso-called Dinaric race of Deniker (which Fleure and James mention in\r\nconnection with the third type but hesitate to class with it), which\r\nextends from the Tyrol along the mountainous east coast of the Adriatic\r\ninto Albania. Further study of the Tripolje culture (see note to p.\r\n143 : 15) and the mixture of population north of the Carpathians, where\r\nthe early Nordics and early Alpines came in contact, may throw light on\r\nthis question, as well as upon the problem of the acquisition of Aryan\r\nlanguages by the Alpines.\r\n\r\nAll these four round skulled types seem to have been of West Asiatic\r\norigin, but their relationship to each other and to the true Mongols of\r\ncentral Asia is as yet undetermined. One thing is certain, that the\r\nAlpine Slavs north and east of the Carpathians, and, to a less degree,\r\nthe inhabitants of Hungary and Bulgaria, have in their midst a very\r\nconsiderable Mongoloid element, which has entered Europe since the\r\nbeginning of our era.\r\n\r\n134 : 12 _seq._ For further characters of the Alpines see Ripley, pp.\r\n123–128, 416 _seq._, and p. 139 of this book.\r\n\r\n135 : 1.

In this\r\nway may also be accounted for the apparent decline in the stature of the\r\nmodern Swiss, who certainly do not, as a rule, now justify the\r\ndescriptions given of their huge physical development in earlier days,\r\nthe days of halberds, morgensterns and two-handed swords.” These\r\nmercenaries were Teutonic, but their Celtic predecessors were addicted\r\nto the same habit as G. Dottin has shown on p. 257 of his _Manuel\r\nCeltique_: “When the Celts could not battle on their own account or\r\nagainst their neighbors, they offered their services for the price of\r\nsilver to foreign kings. There is hardly a country that was not overrun\r\nwith Celtic mercenaries, nor struggles in which they had not taken part.\r\nAs far back as 368 B. C. an army sent by Denys, the Ancient, to Corinth\r\nto aid the Spartiates, was in part formed of Celtic foot soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“Pas d’argent, pas de Suisses,” as the old saying has it.\r\n\r\nSee also Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, chap.

Harrison, _On the Survival of Certain Racial\r\nFeatures in the Population of the British Isles_. Fleure and James\r\ndescribe the type as follows on p. 136: “With the beakers have long been\r\nassociated the broad-headed, strong-browed type, long known to\r\narchæologists as the Bronze Age race, but better called the ‘Beaker\r\nMakers,’ or Borreby type, for we now think that these people reached\r\nBritain without a knowledge of bronze.... The general description of\r\nthem is that they must have been taller than the Neolithic British,\r\naveraging 5 feet 7 inches, rather strongly built, with long forearms and\r\ninclined to roughness of feature. The head was broad (skull index over\r\n80, often 82 or more) and the supraciliary arches strong, but very\r\ndistinctly separated in most cases by a median depression, and thus\r\nstrongly contrasted with the continuous supraciliary ridges of _e. g._,\r\nNeanderthal man ... Keith ... thinks it [the type] was usually brown to\r\nfair in colouring at all periods, and this seems to be a very general\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\n138 : 3. Beddoe, 4, p. 16: “On the whole, however, we cannot be far\r\nwrong in describing the British skulls of the bronze period as\r\ndistinctly brachycephalic; and this seems to have been the case in\r\nScotland as well as in England (see D. Wilson, _Archæological and\r\nPrehistoric Annals_, pp. 168–171). Whencesoever they came, the men of\r\nthe British bronze race were richly endowed, physically. They were, as a\r\nrule, tall and stalwart, their brains were large and their features, if\r\nsomewhat harsh and coarse, must have been manly and even commanding. The\r\nchieftain of Gristhorpe, whose remains are in the Museum of York, must\r\nhave looked a true king of men with his athletic frame, his broad\r\nforehead, beetling brows, strong jaws and aquiline profile.”\r\n\r\n138 : 14.

From this region, the\r\nHuns, like a fruitful root of bravest races, sprouted into two hordes of\r\npeople. Some of these are called Altziagiri, others, Sabiri; and they\r\nhave different dwelling places. The Altziagiri are near Cherson, where\r\nthe avaricious traders bring in the goods of Asia. In summer they range\r\nthe plains, their broad domains, wherever the pasturage for their cattle\r\ninvites them, and betake themselves in winter beyond the sea of Pontus.\r\nNow the Hunuguri are known to us from the fact that they trade in marten\r\nskins. But they have been cowed by their bolder neighbors.” Also on the\r\nHunuguri see Zeuss, p. 712.\r\n\r\n143 : 5 _seq._ The invasion of the Avars and the Magyars.

III, _Europe_, especially p. 40; and A.\r\nLefèvre, _Germains et Slavs_, p. 156. Minns, in an article on the Slavs,\r\nsays: “Pliny (N. H., IV, 97) is the first to give the Slavs a name which\r\ncan leave us in no doubt. He speaks of the Venedi (_cf._ Tacitus,\r\n_Germania_, 46, Veneti); Ptolemy (_Geog._, III, 5, 7, 8) calls them\r\nVenedæ and puts them along the Vistula and by the Venedic Gulf, by which\r\nhe seems to mean the Gulf of Danzig; he also speaks of the Venedic\r\nmountains to the south of the sources of the Vistula, that is, probably\r\nthe northern Carpathians. The name Venedæ is clearly Wend, the name that\r\nthe Germans have always applied to the Slavs. Its meaning is unknown. It\r\nhas been the cause of much confusion because of the Armorican Veneti,\r\nthe Paphlagonian Enetæ, and above all the Enetæ-Venetæ at the head of\r\nthe Adriatic.... Other names in Ptolemy which almost certainly denote\r\nSlavic tribes are the Veltæ on the Baltic. The name Slav first occurs in\r\nPseudo-Cæsarius (Dialogues, II, 110; Migne, P. G., XXXVIII, 985, early\r\n6th century), but the earliest definite account of them under that name\r\nis given by Jordanes (Getica [_History of the Goths_], V, 34, 35), about\r\n550 A. D.: ‘Within these rivers lies Dacia, encircled by the Alps as by\r\na crown. Near their left ridge, which inclines toward the north, and\r\nbeginning at the source of the Vistula, the populous race of the Venethi\r\ndwell, occupying a great expanse of land. Though their names are now\r\ndispersed amid various clans and places, yet they are chiefly called\r\nSclaveni and Antes. The abode of the Sclaveni extends from the city of\r\nNoviodunum and the lake called Mursianus, to the Dnâster, and northward\r\nas far as the Vistula. They have swamps and forests for their cities.\r\nThe Antes, who are the bravest of these peoples dwelling in the curve of\r\nthe sea of Pontus, spread from the Dnâster to the Dnâper, rivers that\r\nare many days’ journey apart.’” See also Zaborowski, 1, pp. 272 _seq._\r\n\r\nThe name _Wends_, as has been said, was used by the Germans to designate\r\nthe Slavs. It is now used for the Germanized Polaks, and especially for\r\nthe Lusatian Wends or Sorbs. It is first found in English used by\r\nAlfred. Canon I. Taylor, in _Words and Places_, p. 42, says: “The\r\nSclavonians call themselves either _Slowjane_, ‘the intelligible men,’\r\nor else _Srb_ which means ‘kinsmen,’ while the Germans call them\r\n_Wends_.”\r\n\r\nHaddon, 3, p. 47, says: “The Slavs, who belong to the Alpine race, seem\r\nto have had their area of characterization in Poland and the country\r\nbetween the Carpathians and the Dnieper; they may be identified with the\r\nVenedi.”\r\n\r\nIn the author’s opinion these people have, so far as is known, nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the tribe of Veneti at the head of the Adriatic, nor\r\nwith the Veneti in western Europe in what is now Brittany. Of the former\r\nRipley, p. 258, says that they have been generally accepted as of\r\nIllyrian derivation and cites D’Arbois de Jubainville, Von Duhn,\r\nPigorini, Sergi, Pullé, Moschen and Tedeschi as authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Veneti in Italy are tall, broad-headed and some are blond, having\r\nmixed with the Teutons. They possessed some eastern habits, such as\r\ntheir marriage customs, as set forth in Herodotus. They were\r\nflourishing, wealthy and peaceful. Later they were driven to what is now\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nThe Veneti in Gaul were a powerful maritime people, who carried on a sea\r\ntrade with Britain. Strangely, perhaps, the ancient name of northern\r\nWales was Venedotia. The name Veneto, however, has nothing to do with\r\nthat of Vandal. For some theories as to the relationships of some of\r\nthese Veneti, see Zaborowski, 3.\r\n\r\n143 : 15. Gallicia and the Tripolje Culture. _Cf._ pp. 113–114. Gallicia\r\nis not far from the known location of the Brünn-Prêdmost race, which was\r\n_dolichocephalic with a long face_. This early appearance of a\r\ndolichocephalic race at the point where the dolichocephalic Nordics\r\nlater came in contact with the Alpines is very significant.\r\n\r\nThe locality is in the neighborhood of the Tripolje area in southern\r\nRussia, for which see Minns, _Scythians and Greeks_, pp. 130–142, and\r\nPeake, 2, p. 164.\r\n\r\nMinns says: “The first finds of Neolithic settlements in Russia were\r\nmade near the village of Tripolje, on the Dnêpr, forty miles below Kiev,\r\nand this name has since been extended to the culture of a large area in\r\nsouthern Russia. The remains consist of so-called ‘areas’ with buildings\r\nwhich had wattled, clay-covered walls which were fired when dry to give\r\nthem greater hardness. Pottery is present in great abundance and variety\r\nof forms. These bear painted decorations which are very artistic. There\r\nare a few figurines. The buildings were not dwellings but probably\r\nchapels. The homes were probably pit dwellings. Bodies of the dead were\r\nincinerated and deposited in urns.\r\n\r\n“The theory has been abandoned that this was an autochthonous\r\ndevelopment, typical of the Indo-Europeans [Nordics] before they\r\ndifferentiated (_cf._ Chvojka, the first discoverer). Although similar\r\nto Ægean art this was earlier (see Von Stern, _Prehistoric Greek Culture\r\nin the South of Russia_). It came suddenly to an end and had no\r\nsuccessor in that region. The people were agriculturalists long before\r\nthe Scythians, but the next people who lived there were thorough nomads.\r\nNiederle (_Slav. Ant._, I) dates them 2000 B. C. The Tripolje people\r\neither moved south or were overwhelmed by new comers.” As Peake says, 2,\r\npp. 164–165, here was a very likely point of contact between the Nordic\r\nand Alpine stocks, a mixture which, in the opinion of the author, may\r\nultimately throw some light on the origin of the Dinaric and Beaker\r\nMaker types. Through this region both Alpines and Nordics must have\r\npassed many times in their wanderings. Here perhaps the Alpines became\r\npartly Nordicized, especially as to their language.\r\n\r\n143 : 21. Sarmatians. There has been considerable confusion over these\r\npeople, owing to the various ways in which the name has been spelled by\r\nearly and later writers, and to the fact that they dwelt in the region\r\nwhere both Alpines and Nordics must have existed side by side. The name\r\nSarmatians has been applied at one time to Nordics, at another to\r\nAlpines or even Mongolians, depending on the dates when they were\r\ndiscussed and the bias of various writers. We have no generic name for\r\nthe Alpine peoples who must have been in this region in early times,\r\nexcept that of Sarmatians or Scythians. As the Scythians are apparently\r\nstrongly Nordic in character, the name Sarmatians seemed more fitting to\r\napply to the Alpine tribes who were certainly there. Not all authorities\r\nare agreed as to their affiliations, however, as has been said.\r\n\r\nJordanes declares that the Sarmatians and the Sauromatæ were the same\r\npeople. Stephanus Byzantius states that the Syrmatæ were identical with\r\nthe Sauromatæ. They are first mentioned by Polybius as being in Europe\r\nin 179 B. C. (XXV, II; XXVI, VI, 12). But in Asia we hear of them as\r\nearly as 325 B. C., according to Minns, p. 38, who says that they\r\ngradually shifted westward, until in 50 A. D. they were in the Danube\r\nvalley. Jordanes later speaks of the Carpathian mountains as the\r\nSarmatian range. Mierow, in the notes to his translation of Jordanes,\r\nmakes the Sarmatians a great Slavic people dwelling from the Vistula to\r\nthe Don, in what is now Poland and Russia. (See also Hodgkin, _Italy_,\r\nvol. I, part I, p. 71.) According to Jordanes, the Sarmatians were\r\nbeyond Dacia (the ancient Gothic land) and to the north (XII, 74). It is\r\nwith these statements in mind that the author has designated them as\r\nAlpines.\r\n\r\nMinns describes the Sarmatians as nomads of the Caspian steppes who wore\r\narmor like the Hiung-nu. About 325 B. C. there was a decline of the\r\nScyths and they appear. During the second and third centuries A. D. was\r\nthe time when they spread over the vast regions from Hungary to the\r\nCaspian. Minns, however, is firm in the belief that they were Iranians\r\n[Nordics], like the Alans, Ossetes, Jasy, etc. In the second half of the\r\nfourth century B. C. they were still east of the Don or just crossing;\r\nfor the next century and a half we have very scanty knowledge of what\r\nwas happening in the steppes. Procopius, III, II, also makes them Goths.\r\n(See the note to p. 66 : 16.) Feist, 5, p. 391, quotes Tacitus as to\r\ntheir being horse-loving nomads of south Russia. See also D’Arbois de\r\nJubainville, 4, t. I, and Gibbon, chaps. XVIII, XXV, etc., for further\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n144 : 11 _seq._ See the authorities quoted, in Ripley, pp. 361–362. The\r\nBashkirs, however, are partly Finn, partly Tatar as well.\r\n\r\n144 : 26–145: 1. Ripley, pp. 416 _seq._ and 434.\r\n\r\n145 : 3. Ripley, p. 434.\r\n\r\n145 : 7.

The old\r\nBulgarians were a Finnic tribe (just which is a matter of much dispute).\r\nThey crossed the Danube toward the end of the seventh century.

Of the numerous tribes who, since the Christian Era, have\r\nentered Europe and Anatolia from western Asia some were undoubtedly pure\r\nMongoloids, like the Huns of Attila, or the hordes of Genghis Khan.\r\nOthers were probably under Mongoloid leaders, and included a large\r\nproportion of West Asiatic Alpines (_i. e._, Turcomans), while still\r\nothers may have been substantially Alpines. The Mongols in their sweep\r\ninto Europe would naturally gather up and carry with them many of the\r\ntribes of western Asia, or perhaps more often would drive the latter\r\nahead of them.\r\n\r\n146 : 3 _seq._ Ripley, p. 139; Taylor, 1, p. 119; Peake, 2, p. 162.\r\n\r\n146 : 8.

See pp. 122 and 138 of this book.\r\n\r\n147 : 7 _seq._ Accad and Sumer. Prince, and Zaborowski (after de Sarzec)\r\ngive the earliest date of Accad as about 3800 B. C., but Prince thinks\r\nthis date too old by 700–1000 years. See also Zaborowski, 1, pp.\r\n118–125. H. R. Hall, in _The Ancient History of the Near East_, reviews\r\nthe entire work in this field in his first chapter. According to him,\r\ndates in Babylonia can be traced as far back as those of Egypt, without\r\ncoming to a time when there was no writing or metal, while Egyptian\r\nrecords begin in a Neolithic culture. The earliest dates so far\r\nestablished are in the fourth millennium B. C., but already a high\r\ndegree of civilization had been reached there or elsewhere by people who\r\nbrought it to Babylonia. Hall, p. 176, says: “The most ancient remains\r\nthat we find in the city mounds are Sumerian. The site of the ancient\r\nShurripak, at Fârah in Southern Babylonia, has lately been excavated.\r\nThe culture revealed by this excavation is Sumerian, and metal-using,\r\neven at the lowest levels. The Sumerians apparently knew the use of\r\ncopper at the beginning of their occupation of Babylonia, and no doubt\r\nbrought this knowledge with them.” See chap. V of Hall’s book, and the\r\ntwo great works of King, the _Chronicles Concerning the Early Babylonian\r\nKings_, and _The History of Sumer and Akkad_, as well as Rogers’s\r\n_History of Babylonia and Assyria_. In his preface to the first\r\nmentioned of his two works King states that the new researches are\r\nresulting in a tendency to reduce the dates of these ancient empires\r\nvery considerably, especially for the dynasties. Thus for Su-abu, the\r\nfounder of the first dynasty, a date not earlier than 2100 B. C. is now\r\ngiven, and for Hammurabi one not earlier than the twentieth century B.\r\nC. Accad is by many authors, including Breasted, considered to have been\r\nSemitic from the beginning, and to have been established about 2800 B.\r\nC. But Zaborowski claims that it was not originally Semitic, but\r\nSemitized at a very early date. He makes both city-kingdoms originally\r\nTuranian [by which he means Alpine and pre-Aryan] with an agglutinative\r\nlanguage related to the Altaic. See also Zaborowski, 2. He dates the\r\ncuneiform inscriptions between 3700 and 4000 B. C., after de Sarzec and\r\nde Morgan. Hall draws attention to the remarkable resemblance of the\r\nSumerians to the Dravidians, and is inclined to believe that they may\r\nhave come from India. Both G. Elliot Smith and Breasted claim the\r\nBabylonians derived their culture from Egypt, but the weight of evidence\r\nis gradually accumulating against them. See Hall, chap. V. The relations\r\nof the two regions and Egyptian dates are treated in Reisner’s _Early\r\nDynastic Cemeteries of Naga-ed-Dêr_; and Eduard Meyer, _Geschichte des\r\nAltertums_, should also be consulted. Against these Egyptologists are\r\nmost of the later writers, such as Hall and King and many others. The\r\nlocation of Babylonia is a fact distinctly in favor of its earlier\r\nbeginnings. There is no denying the very remote origin of Egyptian\r\nculture, which in its isolation for so many centuries had ample time to\r\ndevelop its own peculiar features and to become sufficiently strong to\r\nlater extend a very wide influence. There is an interesting study of the\r\nfauna of Egypt by Lortet and Gaillard, which proves that much of it was\r\noriginally African, not Asiatic, as those who wish to prove the opposite\r\ntheory, that Egyptian culture was derived from the east in very remote\r\ntimes, have endeavored to establish. There is no doubt that the\r\nEgyptians were sufficiently plastic and adaptable in the earlier\r\ncenturies of their development, wherever they may have come from, to\r\nmake use of what the continent of Africa contributed in the way of\r\nresources. (See also Gaillard, _Les Tatonnements des Égyptiens_, etc.,\r\nand H. H. Johnston, _On North African Animals_.) To claim that the\r\ncivilization of Sumer was derived directly from Elam, which in turn\r\nobtained its earliest culture from Egypt, is, in the opinion of the\r\nauthor, to reverse the truth. Some authorities believe that Elam was the\r\norigin from which came the civilization found by Pumpelly in Turkestan,\r\nand believed by him to have been not earlier than the end of the third\r\nmillennium B. C. (For a further reference to this see the note to p.\r\n119 : 15 of this book, on Balkh.)\r\n\r\nSee Hall as to the relationship of the Accadians and Sumerians with\r\nElam. Zaborowski says they were all of the same Alpine stock, that is,\r\nthe very early Sumerians and Accadians and Elamites. See 2, p. 411. For\r\nSusa, Elam and Media, see _Les peuples Aryens_, pp. 125–138, and Hall,\r\nchap. V. For the Persians, Zaborowski, 1, pp. 134 _seq._ Ripley, pp.\r\n417, 449–450, discusses some of the eastern tribes, among them the\r\nTadjiks, whom general opinion makes round skulled. These, according to\r\nZaborowski, are the living prototypes of the Susians, Elamites and\r\nMedes. Many writers consider the Medes to have been Nordics and related\r\nto the Persians. The author, however, follows Zaborowski in classing\r\nthem as the early brachycephalic population of Elam or its highlands or\r\nplateau, which was conquered by the Persians. On the Medes and Media see\r\nthe notes to p. 254 : 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CHAPTER V. THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE\r\n\r\n148 : 1. The Mediterranean Race.

Negroes seem to have been unknown in Egypt and Nubia in\r\npre-dynastic days and only appear in small numbers in the third and\r\nfourth dynasties, in the South. The great ruins on the Zambezi at\r\nZimbabwe were probably the work of the Mediterranean race and are to be\r\ndated about 1000 B. C. In other words, all northeast Africa, including\r\nNubia, the northern Sudan, the ancient Kingdom of Meroë at the junction\r\nof the Blue and White Niles, Abyssinia and the adjoining coast were\r\noriginally part of the domain of the Mediterranean race.\r\n\r\nIn the recent kingdom of the Mahdi, the predominant element was not\r\nNegro but Arab more or less mixed.\r\n\r\n152 : 16.

Giuffrida-Ruggeri, in _A Sketch of the Anthropology of\r\nItaly_, p. 101, says of the composition of the population of Rome: “The\r\nthree fundamental European races, _H. mediterraneus_, _H. alpinus_, and\r\n_H. nordicus_, had their representatives among the ancient Romans,\r\nalthough the skeletal remains of the Mediterraneans and the Northerners\r\nare difficult to distinguish from each other. It is also possible that\r\nthe Northerners belonged to the aristocrats who preferred to burn their\r\ndead. In the calm tenacity and quiet growth of the Roman people perhaps\r\nthe descendants of _H. nordicus_ represented the turbulent restlessness\r\nof violent and bold individuals which, even in Roman history, one is\r\nable to discern from time to time.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note what Charles W. Gould has\r\nsaid on p. 117, in _America, a Family Matter_, concerning Sulla. He\r\ndescribes him as follows: “Even during the terror Sulla found time for\r\nenjoyment. Tawny hair, piercing blue eyes, fair complexion readily\r\nsuffused with color as emotion and red blood surged within, Norseman\r\nthat he was, he presided over constant and splendid entertainments,\r\ntaking more pleasure in a witty actor than in the degenerate men and\r\nwomen of the old nobility who elbowed their way in.” Also see the notes\r\nto p. 215 : 21.\r\n\r\n154 : 5. Quarrels between the Patricians and the Plebs. See Tenney\r\nFrank, _Roman Imperialism_, pp. 5 _seq._, for a discussion of the\r\nmixture of races, “only we cannot agree that a social state can\r\naccomplish race amalgamation. The two races are still there.” Boni,\r\n_Notizie degli Scavi_, vol. III p. 401, believes that the Patricians\r\nwere the descendants of the immigrant Aryans, while the Plebeians were\r\nthe offspring of the aboriginal Non-Aryan stock. Compare this with the\r\nstatements of early writers concerning the conditions in Gaul,\r\nespecially as summed up by Dottin in his _Manuel Celtique_.\r\n\r\nFrank says, concerning the quarrels, in chap. II, _op. cit._: “Roman\r\ntradition preserved in the first book of Livy presents a very\r\ncircumstantial account of the several battles by which Rome supposedly\r\nrazed the Latin cities one after another.... Needless to say, if the\r\nLatin tribe had lived in such civil discord as the legend assumes, it\r\nwould quickly have succumbed to the inroads of the mountain tribes.”\r\nThus probably the quarrels between Latin and Etruscan have been\r\noverrated. See again, p. 14, for the oriental origin of some intruding\r\npeople. He says, in a note at the end of the chapter: “Ridgeway, in _Who\r\nwere the Romans_, 1908, has ably, though not convincingly developed the\r\nview that the Patricians were Sabine conquerors. Cuno, _Vorgeschichte\r\nRoms_, I, 14, held that they were Etruscans. Fustel de Coulanges, in his\r\nwell-known work, _La cité antique_, proposed the view that a religious\r\ncaste system alone could explain the division. Eduard Meyer, the article\r\non the Plebs in _Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften_, and Botsford,\r\n_Roman Assemblies_, p. 16, have presented various arguments in favor of\r\nthe economic theory. See Binder, _Die Plebs_, 1909, for a summary of\r\nmany other discussions.”\r\n\r\nBreasted, _Ancient Times_, pp. 495 _seq._, and Sir Harry Johnston,\r\n_Views and Reviews_, p. 97, are two who have touched upon these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nOn Etruria see the note to p. 157 : 14.\r\n\r\n154 : 11. An allusion to the short stature of the Roman legions of Cæsar\r\nin Gaul may be found in Rice Holmes, 2, p. 81. D’Arbois de Jubainville,\r\n_Les Celts en Espagne_, XIV, p. 369, says in describing a combat between\r\nP. Cornelius Scipio and a Gallic warrior: “Scipio was of very small\r\nstature, the Celtiberian warrior with the high stature which in all\r\ntimes in the tales of the Roman historians characterizes the Celtic\r\nrace; and the beginning of the struggle gave him the advantage.” Taylor,\r\n_Origin of the Aryans_, p. 76, says: “The stature of the Celts struck\r\nthe Romans with astonishment. Cæsar speaks of their _mirifica corpora_\r\nand contrasts the short stature of the Romans with the _magnitudo\r\ncorporum_ of the Gauls. Strabo, also, speaking of the Coritavi, a\r\nBritish tribe in Lincolnshire, after mentioning their yellow hair, says:\r\n‘To show how tall they are, I saw myself some of their young men at Rome\r\nand they were taller by six inches than anyone else in the city.’” See\r\nalso Elton, _Origins_, p. 240.\r\n\r\n154 : 18 _seq._ Nordic Aristocracy in Rome.

D’Arbois de Jubainville, 1, XIV, p. 364, says:\r\n“Hannibal left Spain for Italy in 218, but he left there a Carthaginian\r\narmy in the ranks of which marched auxiliaries furnished by the Celtic\r\npeoples of Spain; Roman troops came to combat this army and four years\r\nafter the departure of Hannibal, (_i. e._ in 214), they gave many\r\nbattles to the Carthaginian generals where the Celts were vanquished. In\r\nthe booty there were found abundant Gallic trappings, especially a great\r\nnumber of collars and bracelets of gold; among the dead of the\r\nCarthaginian army left upon the plain were two petty Gallic kings,\r\nMoencapitus and Vismarus. Livy, who tells us these things, says\r\ndistinctly that the trappings were Gallic (Gallica) and that the kings\r\nwere Gallic. See Livy, I, XXIV, c. 42.”\r\n\r\n156 : 13. See the note to p. 192.\r\n\r\n156 : 16. Feist, 5, p. 365, is one of the authors who notes the fact\r\nthat classic writers spoke of light and dark types in Spain.\r\n\r\n156 : 18. This of course means racial evidence. See Mommsen, _History of\r\nthe Roman Provinces_, I, chap. II, and Burke, _History of Spain_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n156 : 25–157 : 3. On the history of the Albigenses the most important\r\nauthority is C. Schmidt, _Histoire de la secte des Cathares ou\r\nAlbigeois_, Paris, 1849. The Albigenses were deeply indebted to the\r\nArabic culture of Saracenic Spain, which was the medium through which\r\nmuch of the ancient Greek science and learning was preserved to modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n157 : 4. Ripley, pp. 260 _seq._ For an exhaustive résumé of the subject\r\nsee Rice Holmes, 2, pp. 277–287. Also consult the notes to p. 235 : 17\r\nof this book.\r\n\r\n157 : 6. See p. 122 for the predominance of the Mediterraneans.\r\n\r\n157 : 10. Umbrians and Oscans. It is fair to assume that some people\r\nbrought the Aryan languages into Italy from the north, and this\r\nintroduction is credited to the Umbrians and Oscans. (See Helbig, _Die\r\nItaliker in der Poebene_, pp. 29–41; Ridgeway, _Early Age of Greece_;\r\nConway, _Early Italic Dialects_.) The Umbrians and Oscans were closely\r\nallied in regard to their language, whatever may have been their ethnic\r\naffinities. In a remoter degree they were connected with the Latins.\r\nFrom the time and starting-point of their migrations, as well as from\r\ntheir type of culture, it would appear that they were cognate with the\r\nearly Nordic invaders of Greece. Whether they were wholly Nordic, or\r\nwere thoroughly Nordicized Alpines, or merely Alpines with Nordic\r\nleaders is not of particular moment in this connection, but if they were\r\nthe carriers of Aryan language and culture they were Nordicized in a\r\ndegree comparable to the genuine Nordics who invaded Greece.\r\nGiuffrida-Ruggeri, in one of the latest papers on Italy, as well as many\r\nearlier authorities, regards the Umbrians as Alpines, but he says they\r\nwere not all round skulled. “The Osci, the Sabines, the Samnites, and\r\nother Sabellic peoples were Aryans or Aryanized, although they inhumated\r\ntheir dead instead of burning them. It is possible that the founders of\r\nRome consisted of both families, as we find both rites in ancient Rome”\r\n(p. 100).\r\n\r\n157 : 14. Etruscans. The author is familiar with the persistent theory\r\nthat the Etruscans came from Asia Minor by sea, but he nevertheless\r\nregards them as indigenous inhabitants of Italy, that is, the Pre-Aryan,\r\nPre-Nordic Mediterraneans, who, as part of a large and extended group,\r\nwere spread over a great part of the shores of the Mediterranean, and\r\nwere at that time the Italian exponents of the prevailing Ægean culture.\r\nDuring the second millennium in which this culture flourished, they were\r\nmuch influenced by Crete, although they developed their civilization\r\nalong special lines. The Etruscan language, excluding the borrowed\r\nelements from later Italic dialects, is apparently in no sense Aryan.\r\n_Cf._ Hall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, pp. 53–54.\r\n\r\n157 : 16. The date 800 is given by Feist, 5, p. 370.\r\n\r\n157 : 18. Livy, V, 33 _seq._, is the authority for the date of the sixth\r\ncentury. See also Polybius, 1, II, c. XVII, § 1. Myers, _Ancient\r\nHistory_, makes the settlement of the Gauls in Italy about the fifth\r\ncentury B. C. Most authorities follow Livy.\r\n\r\n157 : 21. To show how approximate the authorities are on this date, Rice\r\nHolmes, 2, p. 1, and Myers, _Ancient History_, make it 390, while\r\nBreasted gives 382.\r\n\r\n157 : 23. Livy, V, 35–49, treats of the taking of Rome by the Gauls. The\r\nname Brennus means raven; it is from the Celtic _bran_, raven, crow.\r\n\r\n157 : 26. There is a considerable Frankish element there also, among the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n158 : 1 _seq._ An interesting discussion of this event is given by\r\nSalomon Reinach, 2. The invasion was resisted first at Thermopylæ and\r\nlater at Delphi. On p. 81 Reinach says: “In the detailed recital which\r\nPausanius has left us of the invasion of the Galatic bands in Greece,\r\ndealing with the glorious part which the Athenians played in the defence\r\nof the Pass of Thermopylæ. But, when the defile had been forced, the\r\nAthenians departed and Pausanius makes no more mention of them in\r\nrelating the defence of Delphi, where only the Phocians, four hundred\r\nLocrians and two hundred Ætolians figured. It is only after the defeat\r\nof the Gauls that the Athenians, according to Pausanius, came back,\r\ntogether with the Bœotians, to harass the barbarians in their\r\nretreat....” On p. 83 he says: “The barbarians are incontestably the\r\nGalatians.” See also by the same author, _The Gauls in Antique Art_. G.\r\nDottin, pp. 461–462 gives us the following: “Hannibal, traversing\r\nsouthern Gaul, found on his passage only Gauls. On the other hand, Livy\r\nmentions the arrival of Gauls in Provence at the same time as their\r\nfirst descent into Italy, and Justinius places the wars of the Greeks of\r\nMarseilles against the Gauls and Ligurians before the taking of Rome by\r\nthe Gauls. The invasion of the Belgæ is placed then in the third\r\ncentury. It is doubtless contemporaneous with the Celtic invasion of\r\nGreece which was perhaps caused by it.” See also the notes to p. 174 :\r\n21 of this book. According to Myers, _Ancient History_, where the\r\naccount of these events is briefly given on pp. 269–270, the year was\r\n278 B. C. Breasted, 1, p. 449, gives 280 B. C.\r\n\r\nAs late as the fourth century of our era, Celtic forms of speech\r\nprevailed among the Galatians of Asia Minor. According to Jerome\r\n(Fraser’s _Golden Bough_, II, p. 126, footnote), the language spoken\r\nthen in Anatolia was very similar to the dialect of the Treveri, a\r\nCeltic tribe on the Moselle, of whose name Treves is the perpetuator.\r\n“It was to these people that St. Paul addressed one of his epistles.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that at the present time the finest soldiers\r\nof the Turkish army are recruited in the district of Angora which\r\nincludes the territory of ancient Galatia.\r\n\r\n158 : 13. Procopius, IV, 13, says that a number of Moors and their wives\r\ntook refuge in Sicily and also in Sardinia where they established\r\ncolonies. The recent article by Giuffrida-Ruggeri sums up the data for\r\nSicily, Sardinia and Corsica. See also Gibbon, _passim_, and Ripley, pp.\r\n115–116.\r\n\r\n158 : 16. G. Elliot Smith, 1, pp. 94 _seq._, and the notes to pp. 127 :\r\n26 and 128.\r\n\r\n158 : 21. Pelasgians. Sergi, 4, followed by many anthropologists,\r\ndescribes as Pelasgian one branch of the Mediterranean or Eurafrican\r\nrace of mankind and one group of skull types within that race. Ripley,\r\npp. 407, 448, considers them Mediterraneans in all probability, as this\r\nis the oldest layer of population in these regions. So also do Myres,\r\n_Dawn of History_, p. 171, and most of the other authorities. In his\r\n_History of the Pelasgian Theory_, Myres sums up all that was written up\r\nto that time. Homer and other early writers make them the ancient\r\ninhabitants of Greece, who were subdued by the Hellenes. It is generally\r\nagreed that a people resembling in its prevailing skull forms the\r\nMediterranean race of north Africa was settled in the Ægean area from a\r\nremote Neolithic antiquity. D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, devotes a\r\nchapter or more to them, and declares on p. 110: “In fact the Pelasgians\r\nand the Hellenes are of different origin; the first are one of the races\r\nwhich preceded the Indo-Europeans in Europe, the others are\r\nIndo-European.”\r\n\r\nAnother recent writer who deals with this puzzling problem is Sartiaux,\r\nin his _Troie_, pp. 140–143. Finally, Sir William Ridgeway says: “The\r\nAchæans found the land occupied by a people known by the ancients as\r\nPelasgians who continued down to classical times the main element in the\r\npopulation, even in the states under Achæan, and later, under Dorian\r\nrule. In some cases the Pelasgians formed a serf class, _e. g._ in\r\nPenestæ, in Thessaly, the Helots in Laconia and the Gymnesii at Argos;\r\nwhilst they practically composed the whole population of Arcadia and\r\nAttica which never came under either Achæan or Dorian rule. This people\r\nhad dwelt in the Ægean from the Stone Age, and though still in the\r\nBronze Age at the Achæan conquest, had made great advances in the useful\r\nand ornamental arts. They were of short stature, with dark hair and\r\neyes, and generally dolichocephalic. Their chief centers were at\r\nCnossus, Crete, in Argolis, Laconia and Attica, in each being ruled by\r\nancient lines of kings. In Argolis, Prœtus built Tiryns but later under\r\nPerseus, Mycenæ took the lead until the Achæan conquest. All the ancient\r\ndynasties traced their descent from Poseidon, who at the time of the\r\nAchæan conquest was the chief male divinity of Greece and the islands.”\r\n\r\nAs to the Pelasgian being a Non-Aryan tongue, the ancient script at\r\nCrete has not yet been deciphered. Since the ancient Cretans were\r\npresumably Pelasgians, it is safe to identify them with this Non-Aryan\r\nlanguage, although Conway, 2, pp. 141–142, is inclined to believe that\r\nit is related to the Aryan family. See also Sweet, _The History of\r\nLanguage_, p. 103.\r\n\r\n158 : 22. Nordic Achæans. Ridgeway, 1, p. 683, says: “We found that a\r\nfair-haired race greater in stature than the melanochroous Ægean people\r\nhad there [in Greece and the Ægean] been domiciled for long ages, and\r\nthat fresh bodies of tall, fair-haired people from the shores of the\r\nnorthern ocean continually through the ages had kept pressing down into\r\nthe southern peninsulas. From this it followed that the Achæans of Homer\r\nwere one of these bodies of Celts [_i. e._, Nordics], who had made their\r\nway down into Greece and had become the masters of the indigenous race.\r\n\r\n“This conclusion we further tested by an examination of the distribution\r\nof the round shield, the practise of cremation, the use of the brooch\r\nand buckle, and finally the diffusion of iron in Europe, North Africa\r\nand western Asia. Our inductions showed that all four had made their way\r\ninto Greece and the Ægean from Central Europe. Accordingly as they all\r\nappeared in Greece along with the Homeric Achæans, we inferred that the\r\nlatter had brought them with them from central Europe.” Elsewhere, in\r\nthe same book, Ridgeway identifies the Homeric age with the Achæan and\r\nPost-Mycenæan, the Mycenæan with the Pre-Achæan and Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nBury, _The History of Greece_, p. 44, says: “The Achæans were a people\r\nof blond complexion, of Indo-European speech. Among the later Greeks,\r\nthere were two marked types, distinguished by light and dark hair. The\r\nblond complexion was rarer and more prized. This is illustrated by the\r\nfact that women and fops used sometimes to dye their hair yellow or red,\r\nthe κομης ξανθίσματα mentioned in the Danæ of Euripedes.”\r\n\r\n159 : 4–5. Date of the siege of Troy. Hall, _Ancient History of the Near\r\nEast_, p. 69, and many other authorities accept the Parian Chronicle,\r\nwhich makes it 1194–1184 B. C. For the whole question of the Trojan War\r\nsee Félix Sartiaux, _Troie, La Guerre de Troie_.\r\n\r\n159 : 6 _seq._ See the notes to p. 225 : 11.\r\n\r\n159 : 10 _seq._ Bury, _History of Greece_, p. 44; DeLapouge, _Les\r\nsélections sociales_. Beddoe noted in his _Anthropological History of\r\nEurope_ that almost all of Homer’s heroes were blond or chestnut-haired\r\nas well as large and tall. There are many passages in the Iliad which\r\nrefer to the blondness and size of the more important personages.\r\n\r\n159 : 19 _seq._ Bury, _History of Greece_, pp. 57, 59, describes the\r\nGreek tribes which moved down before the Dorians, conquering the\r\nAchæans—the Thessalians, Bœotians, etc. But see Peake, 2, for\r\nThessalians.

XVI, “Some Dorian Descendants,” says the Dorians were\r\nAlpines, and this view is shared by many others, among them Von Luschan.\r\nSee also Myres, _The Dawn of History_, pp. 173 _seq._ and 213. While\r\nthis may be partially true even of the bulk of the population, all the\r\ntribes to the north of the Mediterranean fringe carried a large Nordic\r\nelement, which practically always assumed the leadership.\r\n\r\n160 : 17. For the character of the Dorians, see Bury, p. 62.\r\n\r\n161 : 20. The philosopher Xenophanes, a contemporary of both Philip and\r\nhis son, in discussing man’s notion of God, insists that each race\r\nrepresents the Great Supreme under its own shape: the Negro with a flat\r\nnose and black face, the Thracian with blue eyes and a ruddy complexion.\r\n\r\n161 : 27. Loss of Nordic blood among the Persians. See the note to p.\r\n254 : 11.\r\n\r\n162 : 8. Barbarous Macedonia. Bury, _The History of Greece_, pp.\r\n681–731.\r\n\r\n162 : 14. Alexander the Great. Descriptions of Alexander are found in\r\nPlutarch, who quotes the memoirs of Aristoxenus, a contemporary of\r\nAlexander, regarding the agreeable odor exhaled from his skin; Plutarch\r\nalso says, without giving his authority, who was probably the same, that\r\nAlexander was “fair and of a light color, passing to ruddiness in his\r\nface and upon his breast.” An authority for the statement of blue and\r\nblack eyes is Quintus Curtius Rufus, a Roman historian of the first\r\ncentury A. D., in _Historiarum Alexandri Magni, Libri Decem_. This was\r\nwritten three and one-half centuries after the death of Alexander. The\r\nquotation, from North’s translation of Plutarch, reads: “But when\r\nAppeles painted Alexander holding lightning in his hand he did not shew\r\nhis fresh color, but made him somewhat blacke and swarter than his face\r\nin deede was; for naturally he had a very fayre white colour, mingled\r\nalso with red which chiefly appeared in his face and in his brest.”\r\n\r\nIn Gabon’s _Inquiries into the Human Faculty_, original English edition,\r\nfrontispiece, is a composite photograph of Alexander the Great from six\r\ndifferent medals selected by the curator in the British Museum. The\r\ncurly hair and Greek profile are significant features. The sarcophagus\r\nof Alexander in the Constantinople Museum called the Sidonian, throws\r\nsome light on this point, although there is some uncertainty among\r\narchæologists as to whether or not it is Alexander’s sarcophagus.\r\n\r\n162 : 19.

See his curve for head form.\r\n\r\n163 : 16. Von Luschan, p. 239: “As in ancient Greece a great number of\r\nindividuals seem to have been fair, with blue eyes, I took great care to\r\nstate whether this were the case with the modern ‘Greeks’ in Asia. I\r\nhave notes for 580 adults, males and females. In this number there were\r\n8 with blue and 29 with gray or greenish eyes; all the rest had brown\r\neyes. There was not one case of really light colored hair, but in nearly\r\nall the cases of lighter eyes the hair also was less dark than with the\r\nother Greeks.” See Ripley for European Greeks.\r\n\r\n163 : 19. Albanians. Deniker, 2, pp. 333–334; Von Luschan, p. 224;\r\nRipley, p. 410. Most Albanians are tall and dark. C. H. Hawes, _Some\r\nDorian Descendants_, p. 258 _seq._, says that the percentage of light\r\neyes over light hair is nearly ten times as great, _i. e._, there is 3\r\nper cent of light hair to 30–38 per cent light eyes among Albanians and\r\nselected Greeks and Cretans.

On p. 57 of his _History of Greece_ Bury inclines to the\r\nbelief that the Dorians came through Epirus, and attributes the cause of\r\ntheir invasion to the pressure of the Illyrians, to whom the Dorians\r\nwere probably related. It is known that the Illyrians were round-headed.\r\nFinally they left the regions of the Corinthian Gulf, and sailed around\r\nthe Peloponnesus to southeast Greece, where they settled, leaving only a\r\nfew Dorians behind, who gave their name to the country they occupied,\r\nbut ever afterward were of no consequence in Greek history. Some bands\r\nwent to Crete, others on other islands and some to Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n164 : 15. Character of the Spartans. See Bury, _History of Greece_, pp.\r\n62, 120, 130–135.\r\n\r\n164 : 22.

He says that there is “a tacit\r\nassumption that as the east is the probable quarter in which either the\r\nhuman species or the greater part of our civilization originated,\r\neverything came from it. But surely in this there is a confusion between\r\nthe primary diffusion of mankind over the world at large and those\r\nsecondary movements by which, according to even the ordinary hypothesis,\r\nthe Lithuanians, etc., came from Asia into Europe.”\r\n\r\n167 : 17.

For a lengthy discussion of them and of their migrations, and\r\nof their possible affiliations with the Cimbri, see Ridgeway, 1, pp.\r\n387–397. According to the best Assyriologists the Cimmerians are the\r\nsame people who, known as the Gimiri or Gimirrai, according to cuneiform\r\ninscriptions, were in Armenia in the eighth century B. C. See Hall,\r\n_Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 495. Bury, _History of Greece_,\r\nalso touches on their raids in Asia Minor. Minns, p. 115, believes them\r\nto have been Scythians. G. Dottin, p. 23 and elsewhere, speaking of the\r\nCimmerians and Cimbri, says: “The latter are without doubt Germans,\r\ntherefore the Cimmerians who are the same people are not ancestors of\r\nthe Celts.” The Cimmerians were first spoken of by Homer (Odyssey, XI,\r\n12–19) who describes them as living in perpetual darkness in the far\r\nNorth. Herodotus (IV, 11–13) in his account of Scythia, regards them as\r\nthe early inhabitants of south Russia, after whom the Bosphorus\r\nCimmerius and other places were named, and who were driven by the Scyths\r\nalong the Caucasus into Asia Minor, where they maintained themselves for\r\na century. The Cimmerii are often mentioned in connection with the\r\nThracian Treres who made their raids across the Hellespont, and possibly\r\nsome of them took this route, having been cut off by the Scyths as the\r\nAlani were by the Huns. Certain it is that in the middle of the seventh\r\ncentury B. C., Asia Minor was ravaged by northern nomads (Herodotus, IV,\r\n12), one body of whom is called in Assyrian sources Gimirrai and is\r\nrepresented as coming through the Caucasus. They were Aryan-speaking, to\r\njudge by the few proper names preserved. To the north of the Euxine\r\ntheir main body was merged finally with the Scyths. Later writers have\r\noften confused them with the Cimbri of Jutland. There is no relation\r\nbetween the Cimbri and the Cymbry or Cymry, a word derived from the\r\nWelsh Combrox and used by them to denote their own people. See note to\r\np. 174 : 26\r\n\r\n173 : 14.

See the note to p. 157 : 10.\r\n\r\n173 : 18. The Nordics cross the Rhine into Gaul. Rice Holmes, 2, pp.\r\n11–12, gives the seventh century B. C. as the date when tall fair Celts\r\nfirst crossed the Rhine westward, “but it is unlikely that they were\r\nhomogeneous.... Physically they resembled the tall fair Germans whom\r\nCæsar and Tacitus describe, but they differed from them in character and\r\ncustoms as well as in speech.” See also p. 336, at the bottom, where he\r\nremarks: “Early in the Hallstatt period a tall dolichocephalic race\r\nappeared in the Jura and the Doubs, who may have been the advanced guard\r\nof the Celts.” 1000 B. C. for the appearance of the Celts on the Rhine\r\nis a very moderate estimate of the date at which these Nordics appear in\r\nwestern Europe, as that would be nearly four centuries after the\r\nappearance of the Achæans in Greece and fully two centuries after the\r\nappearance of Nordics who spoke Aryan in Italy. The Hallstatt culture\r\n(see p. 129) with which the invasion of these Nordics is generally\r\nassociated had been in full development for four or five centuries\r\nbefore the date here given for the crossing of the Rhine. 700 B. C.,\r\ngiven by many authorities, seems to the author too late by several\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n173 : 18 _seq._ G. Dottin, _Manuel Celtique_, pp. 453 _seq._, says: “If\r\nthe Celts originated in Gaul, it is likely that their language would\r\nhave left in our nomenclature more traces than we find, and above all,\r\nthat the Celtic denominations would be applied as well to mountains and\r\nwater courses as to inhabited places.... According to D’Arbois de\r\nJubainville, these names were Ligurian. Thus the Celts would have named\r\nonly fortresses, and the names properly geographic would be due to the\r\npopulations which preceded them.... These constituted for the most part\r\nthe plebs, reduced almost to the state of slavery, which the Celtic\r\naristocracy of Druids and Equites dominated.... On the other hand, if\r\none derives the Celts from central Europe, one explains better both the\r\npresence in central Europe of numerous place names, proving the\r\nestablishment of dwellings of the Celts, and their invasions into\r\nsoutheastern Europe, more difficult to conceive if they had had to\r\ntraverse the German forests. The migration of a people to a more fertile\r\ncountry is natural enough; the departure of the Celts from a fertile\r\ncountry like Gaul to a less fertile country like Germany would be very\r\nunlikely.” And it must be remembered that Tacitus wondered why anyone\r\nshould want to live in Germany, with its disagreeable climate, trackless\r\nforests and endless swamps.\r\n\r\nDottin adds the interesting bit of information, on p. 197, that the\r\nGauls, mixed with the Illyrians (Alpines) were the farmers of old Gaul.\r\nThe real Gauls were warriors and hunters.\r\n\r\n173 : 22. Teutons.

Goidels. Rice Holmes, 1, pp. 229, 409–410, and 2, pp. 319–320,\r\nsays not earlier than the sixth or seventh centuries B. C., but\r\nMontelius and others give 800. G. Dottin, pp. 457–460, and D’Arbois de\r\nJubainville, 4, t. I, pp. 342–343, contend that there is no historical\r\nrecord of it. The date depends upon whether the word κασσίτερος, which\r\ndesignates “tin” in the Iliad, is a Celtic word. See also Oman, 2, pp.\r\n13–14, and Rhys and Jones, _The Welsh People_, pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n174 : 7. Rice Holmes, 2, pp. 308 _seq._ and 325 _seq._; Dottin, pp. 1\r\nand 2, and his Conclusion.

Dottin, p. 237: “Cæsar tells us that the\r\nPlebs of Gaul was in a state bordering on slavery. It did not dare by\r\nitself to do anything and was never consulted.” _Cf._ note to p. 173 :\r\n20.\r\n\r\n174 : 11 Gauls in the Crimea. Ridgeway, _Early Age of Greece_, p. 387,\r\nquotes Strabo (309 and 507) and the long Protogenes inscription from\r\nOlbia (_Corp. Inscr. Græc._, II, no. 2058).\r\n\r\n174 : 15. Migration of Nordics from Germany. It occurred about the\r\neighth century B. C., according to many authors, among them G. Dottin,\r\npp. 241, 457–458. “Cæsar, Livy, Justinius, summing up Pompeius Trogus,\r\nAppian and Plutarch, without doubt following a common source, even think\r\nthat excess population is the cause of the Gallic migrations. It is one\r\nof the reasons to which Cæsar attributes the emigration of the Helvetii.\r\nCisalpine Gaul nourished an immense population.”\r\n\r\n174 : 21. Cymry move westward. See Rice Holmes, 2, pp. 319–321; Oman, 2,\r\npp. 13 _seq._ and especially p. 16; Deniker, 2, pp. 320–322; Dottin, pp.\r\n460 _seq._ Both Rhys and Jones, in the _Welsh People_, and G. Dottin,\r\nsuggest that this movement was only part of one great migration which\r\ndispersed the Nordics from a central home. Their appearance in Greece as\r\nGalatians at about the same time may be ascribed to this migration. See\r\nthe notes to p. 158 : 1 _seq._\r\n\r\nOman and many other authorities think the movement occurred some time\r\nbefore 325 B. C.\r\n\r\n174 : 21 _seq._ Cymry and Belgæ. The Cymry or Belgæ were “P Celtic” in\r\nspeech. They first appeared in history about 300 B. C., equipped with a\r\nculture of the second iron period called La Tène. The classic authors\r\nwere apparently uncertain as to whether or not they were Germans (or\r\nTeutons), but they appear to have been largely composed of this element,\r\nand to have arrived previously from Scandinavia and to have adopted the\r\nCeltic tongue. These Belgæ drove out the earlier “Q Celts” or Goidels,\r\nand the pressure they exerted caused many of the later migrations of the\r\nGoidels or Gauls.\r\n\r\nThe groups of tribes which in Cæsar’s time occupied the part of France\r\nto the north and east of the Seine were known as Belgæ, while the same\r\npeople who had crossed to the north of the channel were called Brythons.\r\nTo avoid designating these groups separately the author has called all\r\nthese tribes Cymry, although the term can properly be applied only to\r\nthe “_P_ Celts” of Wales, who adopted this designation for themselves\r\nabout the sixth century A. D., according to Rhys and Jones, p. 26, where\r\nwe read: “The singular is Cymro, the plural Cymry. The word Cymro, is\r\nderived from the earlier Cumbrox or Combrox, which is parallel to the\r\nGaulish Allobrox (plural Allobroges) a name applied by the Gauls to\r\ncertain Ligurians whose country they conquered.... As the word is to be\r\ntraced to Cumbra-land (Cumberland), its use must have extended to the\r\nBrythons” (see Rice Holmes, 2, p. 15, where he says the Brythons spread\r\nthe La Tène culture). “But as the name Cymry seems to have been unknown,\r\nnot only in Brittany, but also in Cornwall, it may be conjectured that\r\nit cannot have acquired anything like national significance for any\r\nlength of time before the battle of Deorham in the year 577, when the\r\nWest Saxons permanently severed the Celts west of the Severn from their\r\nkinsmen (of Gloucester, Somerset, etc., as now known).\r\n\r\n“Thus it is probable that the national significance of the term Cymro\r\nmay date from the sixth century and is to be regarded as the exponent of\r\nthe amalgamation of the Goidelic and Brythonic populations under high\r\npressure from without by the Saxons and Angles.” Therefore it is a\r\npurely Welsh term, properly speaking. Broca, in the _Mémoires\r\nd’anthropologie_, I, 871, p. 395, is responsible for the word as applied\r\nto the invaders of Gaul who spoke Celtic. He called them Kimris. See\r\nalso his remarks in the _Bulletin de la société d’Anthropologie_, XI,\r\n1861, pp. 308–309, and the article by L. Wilser in _L’Anthropologie_,\r\nXIV, 1903, pp. 496–497.\r\n\r\n175 : 12 _seq._ See the notes to p. 32 : 8; also Rice Holmes, 2, p. 337;\r\nFleure and James, pp. 118 _seq._ Taylor, 1, p. 109, says that there is a\r\nsuperficial resemblance between the Teutons and Celts, but a radical\r\ndifference in skulls, the Teutonic being more dolichocephalic. Both are\r\ntall, large-limbed and fair. The Teuton is distinguished by a pink and\r\nwhite skin, the Celt is more florid and inclined to freckle. The Teuton\r\neye is blue, that of the Celt gray, green, or grayish blue.\r\n\r\n175 : 21 _seq._ Rice Holmes, 2, p. 326 _seq._, gives a summary of the\r\ndescriptions of various classic authors. Salomon Reinach, 2, pp. 80\r\n_seq._, discusses Pausanias’ detailed recital of the event. For the\r\noriginal see Pausanias, X, 22. _Cf._ also the note to p. 158 : 1.\r\n\r\n176 : 15–177 : 27. The series of notes which were collected by the\r\nauthor on the wanderings of these Germanic tribes proved so lengthy, and\r\nthe relationships of the peoples under discussion so intricate, that\r\nthey grew beyond all reasonable proportions as notes, and carried the\r\nsubject far afield. Hence it has seemed best to omit them in this\r\nconnection and to embody them in another work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will therefore be sufficient to say here that the results of\r\nthe research have made it clear that all of these tribes were related by\r\nblood and by language, and came originally from Scandinavia and the\r\nneighborhood of the Baltic Sea. For some unknown reason, such as\r\npressure of population, they began, one after another, a southward\r\nmovement in the centuries immediately before the Christian Era, which\r\nbrought them within the knowledge of the Mediterranean world. Their\r\nwanderings were very extensive and covered Europe from southern Russia\r\nand the Crimea to Spain, and even to Africa. Many of these tribes broke\r\nup into smaller groups under distinct names, or united with others to\r\nform large confederacies. Not only did some of them clash with each\r\nother almost to the point of extermination in their efforts to obtain\r\nlands, but in attempting to avoid the Huns came into contact with the\r\nRomans, and broke through the frontier of the Empire at various points.\r\nFrom the Romans they gained many of the ideas which were later\r\nincorporated by them in the various European nations which they founded.\r\nThe result of their conquests was to establish a Nordic nobility and\r\nupper class in practically every country of Europe,—a condition which\r\nhas remained to the present day.\r\n\r\n177 : 12.

D’Arbois de Jubainville, 2, pp. 92–93; Taylor, _Words and\r\nPlaces_, p. 45; and G. Dottin, _Manuel Celtique_, p. 28. This word came\r\nfrom _Volcæ_, the name of a Celtic tribe of the upper Rhine. Their name,\r\nto the neighboring Teutons, came to designate a foreigner. The Volcæ\r\nwere separated into two branches, the Arecomici, established between the\r\nRhone and the Garonne, and the Tectosages, in the region of the upper\r\nGaronne. The term Volcæ has become among the Germans _Walah_, then\r\n_Walch_, from which is derived _Welsch_, which designates the people of\r\nRomance language, such as the Italians and French. Among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons it has become _Wealh_, from which the derivation _Welsh_,\r\nwhich designates the Gauls, and nowadays their former compatriots who\r\nmigrated to England and settled in Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VII.

For a few months\r\ndiplomacy was busy with the choice of a successor. The king of France\r\n(Francis I) poured money into Germany, and was supported in his\r\ncandidature by the pope; the king of England (Henry VIII) sent Pace to\r\ncounteract French designs with the electors; but the issue was never\r\nreally in doubt. Germany would not tolerate a French ruler; and on June\r\n28, 1519, Charles of Spain was elected king of the Romans.”\r\n\r\n184 : 8. Depopulation. (Thirty Years’ War.) _Cambridge Modern History_,\r\nvol. IV, p. 418, says that Germany was particularly afflicted. The data\r\nare unreliable, but the population of the empire was probably reduced by\r\ntwo-thirds, or from 16,000,000 to less than 6,000,000. Bavaria,\r\nFranconia and Swabia suffered most. W. Menzel says: “Germany is reckoned\r\nby some to have lost one-half, by others, two-thirds, of her entire\r\npopulation during the Thirty Years’ War. In Saxony 900,000 men had\r\nfallen within ten years; in Bohemia the number of inhabitants at the\r\ndemise of Frederick II, before the last deplorable inroads made by\r\nBarier and Torstenson, had sunk to one-fourth. Augsburg, instead of\r\n80,000 had 18,000 inhabitants. Every province, every town throughout the\r\nEmpire had suffered at an equal ratio, with the exception of Tyrol....\r\nThe working class had almost totally disappeared. In Franconia the\r\nmisery and depopulation had reached such an extent that the Franconian\r\nestates, with the assent of the ecclesiastical princes, abolished in\r\n1650 the celibacy of the Catholic clergy and permitted each man to have\r\ntwo wives.... The nobility were compelled by necessity to enter the\r\nservices of the princes, the citizens were impoverished and powerless,\r\nthe peasantry had been utterly demoralized by military rule and reduced\r\nto servitude.” It has been said that the city of Berlin contained but\r\n300 citizens; the Palatinate of the Rhine but 200 farmers. In character,\r\nintelligence and in morality, the German people were set back two\r\nhundred years. There are, in addition to the authorities quoted here,\r\nnumerous others who make the same observations, in fact, this\r\ndepopulation is one of the outstanding results of the Thirty Years’ War.\r\n\r\nSee also Anton Gindely, _History of the Thirty Years’ War_, p. 398.\r\n\r\n184 : 22 _seq._ The _British Medical Journal_ for April 8, 1916; and\r\nParsons, _Anthropological Observations on German Prisoners of War_.\r\n\r\n185 : 6.

Most of the early historians of Russia and Germany\r\nand the monk Nestor, who was the earliest annalist of the Russians,\r\nagree in deriving the Varangians or Varegnes from Scandinavia. They\r\nprobably were more of the same people whom we find as Varini on the\r\ncontinental shores of the North Sea. The names of the first founders of\r\nthe Russian monarchy are Scandinavian or Northman. Their language,\r\naccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, differed essentially from the\r\nSclavonian. The author of the annals of St. Bertin, who first names the\r\nRussians (Rhos) in the year 939 of his annals, assigns them Sweden for\r\ntheir country. Luitprand calls them the same as the Normans. The Finns,\r\nLaplanders and Esthonians speak of the Swedes to the present day as\r\nRoots, Rootsi, Ruorzi, Rootslane or Rudersman, meaning rowers. See\r\nSchlözer, in his _Nestor_, p. 60; and _Malte Brun_, p. 378, as well as\r\n_Kluchevsky_, vol. I, pp. 56–76 and 92. The Varangians, according to\r\nGibbon, formed the body-guard of the Greek Emperor at Byzantium. These\r\nwere the Russian Varangians, who made their way to that city by the\r\neastern routes. Canon Isaac Taylor, in _Words and Places_, p. 110,\r\nremarks that “for centuries the Varangian Guard upheld the tottering\r\nthrone of the Byzantine emperors.” This Varangian Guard was very largely\r\nreinforced by Saxons fleeing from the Norman Conquest of England. The\r\nname Varangi is undoubtedly identical with _Frank_, and is the term used\r\nin the Levant to designate Christians of the western rite, from the days\r\nof the Crusades down to the present time. _Cf._ Ferangistan—_land of the\r\nFranks_, or, as it is now interpreted, “Europe,” especially western\r\nEurope. E. B. Soane, To _Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise_, uses\r\nthe phrase _á la ferangi_ as describing anything imported from western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n190 : 1.

W. R. Livermore, in correspondence, says that\r\npractically all students on the Celtiberian question agree upon the\r\npoint where the Celts entered Spain, namely, that designated by de\r\nJubainville. They passed along the Atlantic coast, across the Pyrenees,\r\nwhere the railroad from Paris to Madrid now crosses, about 500 B. C.,\r\nbetween the time of Avienus, ± 525 and Herodotus, ± 443. In the time of\r\nAvienus the Ligurians had both ends of the Pyrenees from Ampurias to\r\nBayonne, and controlled the sources of the Batis. In the time of\r\nHerodotus, the Gauls had the country up to the Curretes. See also\r\nMüllenhoff, _Deutsche Altertumskunde_, II, p. 238, and Deniker, 2, p.\r\n321. D’Arbois de Jubainville, _op. cit._, especially pp. 363–364, says:\r\n“The name Celtiberian was adopted at the time of Hannibal, who entered\r\nSpain, married a Celt, and thus won the assistance of the Celts in his\r\nmarch on Rome.... The name Celtiberian is the generic term for\r\ndesignating the Celts established in the center of Spain, but the word\r\nis sometimes taken in a less extended sense to designate only one part\r\nof this important group.”\r\n\r\n192 : 8. Sergi, 4, p. 70. See also p. 156 of this book.\r\n\r\n192 : 14. See the note to p. 156, or Ridgeway, _The Early Age of\r\nGreece_, p. 375.\r\n\r\n192 : 18. Ridgeway, _op. cit._, p. 375. This may refer to the veins\r\nshowing blue through the fair Nordic skin.\r\n\r\n192 : 18. Ridgeway, _op. cit._, p. 375. Here he says: “The Visigoths\r\nbecame the master race, and from them the Spanish Grandees, among whom\r\nfair hair is a common feature, derive their _sangre azul_. After a\r\nglorious struggle against the Saracens, which served to keep alive their\r\nmartial ardor and thus brace up the ancient vigor of the race, from the\r\n16th century onward the Visigothic wave seems to have exhausted its\r\ninitial energy, and the aboriginal stratum has more and more come to the\r\nsurface and has thus left Spain sapless and supine.”\r\n\r\n102 : 22. Taylor, 2, pp. 308–309, says: “From the name of the same\r\nnation,—the Goths of Spain,—are derived curiously enough, two names, one\r\nimplying extreme honor, the other extreme contempt. The Spanish noble,\r\nwho boasts that the _sangre azul_ of the Goths runs in his veins with no\r\nadmixture, calls himself an _hidalgo_, that is, a son of the Goth, as\r\nhis proudest title.” A footnote to this reads: “The old etymology _Hijo\r\nd’algo_, son of someone, has been universally given up in favor of _hi’\r\nd’al Go_, son of the Goth. (More correctly _hi’ del Go’_.) See a paper\r\n‘On Oc and Oyl’ translated by Bishop Thirlwall, for the _Philological\r\nMuseum_, vol. II, p. 337.” Taylor goes on to say, however, that the\r\nversion _hi’ d’ algo_, son of someone, is still given as the origin of\r\nthis word in R. Barcia’s _Primer Diccionaria Géneral Étimologico de la\r\nLengua Español_.\r\n\r\nConcerning some other derivations Taylor continues: “Of Gothic blood\r\nscarcely less pure than that of the Spanish Hidalgos, are the Cagots of\r\nSouthern France, a race of outcast pariahs, who in every village live\r\napart, executing every vile or disgraceful kind of toil, and with whom\r\nthe poorest peasant refuses to associate. These Cagots are the\r\ndescendants of those Spanish Goths, who, on the invasion of the Moors,\r\nfled to Aquitaine, where they were protected by Charles Martel. But the\r\nreproach of Arianism clung to them, and religious bigotry branded them\r\nwith the name _câ gots_ or ‘Gothic Dogs.’ a name which still clings to\r\nthem, and keeps them apart from their fellow-men.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere we find the following: “The fierce and intolerant Arianism of\r\nthe Visigothic conquerors of Spain has given us another word. The word\r\nVisigoth has become Bigot, and thus on the imperishable tablets of\r\nlanguage the Catholics have handed down to perpetual infamy the name and\r\nnation of their persecutors.”\r\n\r\n193 : 14 _seq._ _Cf._ DeLapouge, _L’Aryen_, p. 343, where he says that\r\nthe exodus of the Conquistadores was fatal to Spain.\r\n\r\n193 : 17.

The\r\nmodern composition of the French population has been investigated by\r\nEdmond Bayle and Dr. Leon MacAuliffe, who find that there is decided\r\nrace mixture, with chestnut pigmentation of hair and eyes predominating.\r\nBlond traits were found to be almost confined to the north and east,\r\nwhile brunet characters prevail in the south.

The latter were by far the most numerous, and\r\nspread over a greater extent of country; but to the Salians belongs the\r\nglory of founding the great Frankish kingdom under the royal line of the\r\nMerwings” (Merovingians).\r\n\r\n196 : 2 _seq._ Ripley, p. 157; DeLapouge, _passim_.\r\n\r\n196 : 7 _seq._ Oman, 2, pp. 499 _seq._; Beddoe, 4, p. 94 and chap.

See Grillière, pp.\r\n392 _seq._ W. R. Inge, _Outspoken Essays_, pp. 41–42: “The notion that\r\nfrequent war is a healthy tonic for a nation is scarcely tenable. Its\r\ndysgenic effect, by eliminating the strongest and healthiest of the\r\npopulation while leaving the weaklings at home to be the fathers of the\r\nnext generation, is no new discovery. It has been supported by a\r\nsuccession of men, such as Tenon, Dufau, Foissac, DeLapouge and Richet\r\nin France; Tiedemann and Seeck in Germany; Guerrini in Italy; Kellogg\r\nand Starr Jordan in America. The case is indeed overwhelming. The lives\r\ndestroyed in war are nearly all males, thus disturbing the sex\r\nequilibrium of the population. They are in the prime of life, at the age\r\nof greatest fecundity; and they are picked from a list out of which from\r\n20 to 30 per cent have been rejected for physical unfitness. It seems to\r\nbe proved that the children born in France during the Napoleonic wars\r\nwere poor and undersized, 30 millimeters below the normal height.”\r\n\r\n197 : 11.

Two interesting letters bearing on the\r\nracial differences composing conscript and volunteer armies in the\r\nrecent World War may here be quoted.\r\n\r\nThe first, from Mr. T. Rice Holmes, relates to the English army of\r\nKitchener in 1915. “Perhaps it may interest you to know that in 1915\r\nwhen recruits belonging to Kitchener’s army were training near\r\nRochampton, I noticed that almost every man was fair,—not, of course,\r\nwith the pronounced fairness of the men of the north of Scotland, who\r\nare descended from Scandinavians, but with such fairness as is to be\r\nseen in England. These men, as you know, were volunteers.”\r\n\r\nThe second, from DeLapouge, concerns our American army in France. “I\r\nhave been able to verify for myself your observations on the American\r\narmy. The first to arrive were all volunteers, all dolicho-blonds; but\r\nthe draft afterwards brought in inferior elements. At St. Nazaire, at\r\nTours, and at Poictiers, I have been able to examine American soldiers\r\nby the tens of thousands and I have been able to formulate for myself a\r\nvery definite conception of the types.”\r\n\r\n199 : 9.

If there is\r\nany indication of the intellectual rating of various foreign countries\r\nto be derived from the draft examinations of our foreign-born, grouped\r\naccording to place of nativity, a paper by Major Bingham of Washington,\r\nin regard to “The Relation of Intelligence Ratings to Nativity” may be\r\nquoted. The total number of foreign-born examined, which formed the\r\nbasis of this report, was 12,407, while the total number of native-born\r\nwhites was 93,973. Only countries were considered which were represented\r\nby more than 100 men in the examinations. The tests were divided into\r\nthose for literates and those for illiterates, so that even men not\r\nspeaking English could be graded. In these examinations the Irish made a\r\nsurprisingly poor showing, falling far below the English and Scotch, who\r\nstood very high, as well as below the Germans, Austrians, French\r\nCanadians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, Swedes and Norwegians, being about on\r\na par with the Russians, Poles and Italians. Therefore, if these tests\r\nare any criterion of intellectual ability, the Irish are noticeably\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\n203 : 18. See p. 123 of this book.\r\n\r\n203 : 24. Beddoe, 4, p. 139 and chap.

The term Picts has been very widely accepted as a\r\ndesignation for those Pre-Celtic inhabitants, who were certainly there.\r\nNo other name has been given for them and it is in this sense that it is\r\nused here, and that Rice Holmes himself is obliged to use it on p. 456.\r\nIt will be useful to the reader to peruse pp. 13–16 of Rhys and Jones,\r\n_The Welsh People_. Appendix B, of that volume (pp. 617 _seq._), written\r\nby Sir J. Morris Jones, entitled “Pre-Aryan Syntax in Insular Celtic,”\r\nshows the Anaryan survivals in Welsh and Irish to be remarkably similar\r\nto ancient Egyptian, which, with the Berber of intermediate situation,\r\nbelongs to the great Hamitic family of languages and was the tongue of\r\nthe primitive Mediterraneans. For Beddoe’s opinion see 4, p. 36. On p.\r\n247 he says, speaking of the Highland people: “Every here and there a\r\ndecidedly Iberian physiognomy appears, which makes one think Professor\r\nRhys right in supposing that the Picts were in part, at least, of that\r\nstock.” See Hector McLean, 1, p. 170, where he suggests that the Picts\r\nwere originally the Pictones from the south bank of the Loire in Gaul.\r\n\r\nThe name Pixie, met with so frequently in Irish legends, and relating to\r\nlittle people similar to dwarfs, may have some connection with these shy\r\nlittle Mediterraneans whom the Nordics found on their arrival and who\r\nwere forced back by them into inaccessible districts.\r\n\r\n204 : 19. See the article on “Pre-Aryan Syntax in Insular Celtic,” just\r\nmentioned, and Beddoe, 4, p. 46, quoting Elton, p. 167.

These gentlemen say, on\r\np. 38, that they believe that certain types, without any intervening\r\nsocial or linguistic barrier for centuries, have apparently persisted\r\nside by side in very marked fashion in certain parts of Wales.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Baring Gould confirms this: “In Wales there are two\r\ntypes, the dark Siluric and the light Norman. Here in the west of\r\nEngland we have the same two types. In this neighborhood one village is\r\nfair, the next dark and sallow. It is the same in Cornwall; in certain\r\nvillages the type is dark and sallow, in others fair. There is no\r\ncomparison between the capabilities moral and physical between the two\r\ntypes. The dark is tricky, unreliable and goes under, and the fair type\r\npredominates in trade, in business, in farming and in every department.”\r\n\r\nBeddoe, Fleure and James, and also Hector McLean remark on the various\r\nmoral and mental capabilities of the different physical types.\r\n\r\n206 : 13.

The breadth of skull “of the Norman\r\naristocracy may probably have been smaller, but the ecclesiastics of\r\nNorman or French nationality, who abounded in England for centuries\r\nafter the conquest and who, in many cases, rose from the subjugated\r\nCeltic [Alpine] layer of population, have left us a good many broad and\r\nround skulls. Thus the crania of three bishops of Durham ... yield an\r\nindex of 85.6, while those of eight Anglican canons dating from before\r\nthe conquest yield one of 74.9. So far, however, as the actual conquest\r\nand armed occupation of England was concerned, the aristocracy and\r\nmilitary caste, who were largely of Scandinavian type, came over in much\r\nlarger proportion than the more Belgic or Celtic lower ranks, insomuch\r\nthat it has been said that more of the Norman _noblesse_ came over to\r\nEngland than were left behind.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages the church was a very democratic institution, and\r\nit was only through its offices that the lower ranks succeeded in\r\nworking their way up. This was partly because the older peoples\r\npossessed the Roman learning, and because the northern invaders were\r\nmore addicted to martial than to priestly pursuits. The conquered people\r\nhad no chance to rise in political, aristocratic or military circles,\r\nand contented themselves with the church. At the present time, in many\r\nCatholic countries, notably Ireland, the priests are derived from the\r\nlowest stratum of the population, as may be clearly recognized in their\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n208 : 14.

D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4,\r\nt. I, pp. ix and 214, gives the date when the Indo-Europeans were united\r\nas 2500 B. C. Feist, 5, believes the Nordics were still in their\r\nhomeland between 2500 and 2000 B. C. This was the transition period from\r\nStone to Bronze in north-middle and eastern Europe. Breasted, _Ancient\r\nTimes_, says: “It has recently been scientifically demonstrated on the\r\nbasis, chiefly, of the Amarna tablets and other cuneiform evidence, that\r\nthe Aryans had by 2000 or 1800 B. C. begun to leave a home on the east\r\nor southeast of the Caspian, where they divided into two branches, one\r\ngoing southeast into India, the other southwest into Babylon.” “The\r\nfirst occurrence of Indo-European names is in the Tell-el-Amarna\r\n(Egyptian) correspondence,” says Myres, _Dawn of History_, p. 153,\r\n“which gives so vivid a picture of Syrian affairs in the years\r\nimmediately after 1400. They represent chieftains scattered up and down\r\nSyria and Palestine, and they include the name of Tushratta, king of the\r\nlarge district of Mitanni beyond Euphrates.... But this is a minor\r\nmatter; nothing is commoner in the history of migratory peoples than to\r\nfind a very small leaven of energetic intruders ruling and organizing\r\nlarge native populations without either learning their subjects’\r\nlanguage or improving their own until considerably later, if at all. The\r\nNorman princes, for example, bear Teutonic names, Robert, William,\r\nHenry; but it is Norman French in which they govern Normandy and\r\ncorrespond with the king of France. All these Indo-European names\r\n(mentioned in the tablets), belong to the Iranian group of languages,\r\nwhich is later found widely spread over the whole plateau of Persia.”\r\n\r\n214 : 1 _seq._ See pp. 158–159 of this book.\r\n\r\n214 : 7 _seq._ Herodotus, IV, 17, 18, 33, 53, 65, 74, etc., for notes on\r\nthe Scythians. Wheat was cultivated in the southern part of Scythia.\r\nCorn was an article of trade, and the loom was used. See also\r\nZaborowski, 1; Ripley; Feist, 5.\r\n\r\n214 : 10. Scythians. According to Zaborowski, 1, the Scythians were the\r\nearliest known Nordic nomads of Scythia, or southern Russia, from whom\r\nno doubt came the Achæans, Cimmerians, etc., and later the Persian\r\nconquerors, the leaders of the Kassites and Mitanni, etc. The Sacæ were\r\nan eastern branch of the Scythians (and likewise the Massagetæ), who\r\nthrew off branches into India. Possibly the Wu-Suns and the Epthalites,\r\nor White Huns, were eastern offshoots. Owing to the fact that Scythia\r\nhas been swept time and again by various hordes moving east and west,\r\nand has served no doubt as a meeting-ground for Alpines, Nordics and\r\nMongols, these may all, at some period or another, have been called\r\nScythians because they inhabited this little-known territory. But the\r\nindications are strongly in favor of the original Scythians being\r\nNordics. It is in this sense that the name is here applied. Minns,\r\n_Scythians and Greeks_, and D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, are two\r\nother authorities who have discussed the Scythians at length.\r\n\r\n214 : 11. Cimmerians. See the note to p. 173.

See p. 161 of this book.\r\n\r\n215 : 15. See p. 160 of this book.\r\n\r\n215 : 25. Dante Alighieri. It is interesting to know that the name\r\nAligheri is Gothic, a corruption of Aldiger. It belongs to such German\r\nnames as those which include the word “_ger_,” spear, as in Gerhard,\r\nGertrude, etc. This name came into the family through Dante’s\r\ngrandmother on the father’s side, a Goth from Ferrara, whose name was\r\nAldigero. With regard to the origin of his grandfather and mother, the\r\nattempt to connect him with Roman families is known to be a pure fiction\r\non the part of the Italian biographers, who thought it more glorious to\r\nbe a Roman than anything else; but his descent from pure Germanic\r\nparentage is practically proved, since the grandfather was a warrior,\r\nknighted by the emperor Conrad, and Dante himself declares that he\r\nbelonged to the petty nobility. Even to the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury many Italians are described in old documents as Alemanni,\r\nLangobardi, etc., _ex alamanorum genere_, _legibus vivens\r\nLangobardorum_, etc. Though the majority of them had adopted Roman law,\r\nwhereby the documentary evidence of their descent usually disappeared,\r\nthey were thoroughly Germanic in blood, especially those to whom Rome\r\nowes much.

Ripley, based on Broca, gives the essential\r\ninformation. Gibbon, chap. XXXIII, is an important reference.\r\n\r\nBlond Moors. Procopius says, IV, 13, describing the fighting with the\r\nMoors in Mauretania beyond Mt. Aurasium, which is thirteen days’ journey\r\nwest of Carthage: “I have heard Ortaias say that beyond these nations of\r\nMoors, beyond Aurasium, which he ruled” [apparently south] “there was no\r\nhabitation of men, but desert land to a great distance, and that beyond\r\nthis desert there are men, not black-skinned like the Moors, but very\r\nwhite in body and fair-haired.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Thornhill relates that about fifteen years ago he was in\r\nMorocco (presumably near Tangier) and while there he saw several purely\r\nblond Berbers from the Riff mountains. A young girl, especially, was an\r\nalmost pure Swedish blond. The coloring, however, was pale and whitish\r\nrather than pink; the eyes were blue and the hair wavy and very blond.\r\n\r\n223 : 21. For the Philistines, Anakim and Achæans see Ridgeway, 1, pp.\r\n618 _seq._ Sir William Ridgeway places the appearance of the Philistines\r\nas nearly synchronous with that of the Achæans, and states that their\r\nweapons and armor were similar to those of the Achæans, but different\r\nfrom those of the other nations of the early world. _Cf._ also Hall,\r\n_Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 72, especially footnote 1, where\r\nhe says: “The Philistines were specially receptive of Hellenic culture\r\nand eager to claim relationship with the Greeks, and disassociate\r\nthemselves from the Semites. Their coin types shew this, see p. 399, n.”\r\nHe regards them as Cretans.\r\n\r\n223 : 22–23. Sons of Anak. Numbers, XIII, 33: “And there we saw the\r\ngiants, the sons of Anak, which came of the giants; and we were in our\r\nown sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight.” Deuteronomy,\r\nI, 28: “Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart,\r\nsaying, ‘The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great\r\nand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the\r\nAnakim there.’”\r\n\r\nFairness of David. I Samuel, XVI, 11, 12: “And Samuel said unto Jesse,\r\nAre here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth the youngest,\r\nand behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and\r\nfetch him; for we shall not sit down till he come hither. And he sent,\r\nand brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful\r\ncountenance, and goodly to look to....” Chap. XVII, 41,42: “And the\r\nPhilistine came on and drew near unto David, and when the Philistine\r\nlooked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth,\r\nand ruddy and of a fair countenance.” In the Hebrew, the phrase _Of a\r\nBeautiful Countenance_ means fair of eyes.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Nordics in Syria among the Amorites is indicated by the\r\ntall stature, long-headedness and fair skin with which they are depicted\r\non the Egyptian monuments. In some instances their eyes are blue. See p.\r\n59 of Albert T. Clay’s _The Empire of the Amorites_, also Sayce, and\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n224 : 3. Wu-Suns and Hiung-Nu. Minns, _Scythians and Greeks_, p. 121.\r\nDeLapouge, _L’Aryen_, mentions the existence of a number of central\r\nAsiatic tribes in addition to the Wu-Suns, who were Nordic. See also J.\r\nKlaproth, _Tableaux historiques de l’Asie_. Zaborowski, _Les peuples\r\naryens_, p. 286, says: “The Hiung-Nu hurled themselves upon the Illi,\r\nand upon another blond people the Wu-Suns, whose importance was such\r\nthat the Chinese, who have made them known to us, sought their alliance\r\nagainst the Huns. The Chinese knew then, in Turkestan, only the Wu-Suns,\r\nthe Sse, or Sacæ, and the Ta-hia (our Tadjiks).”\r\n\r\n“The Yuë-Tchi, repulsed by the Wu-Suns in 130 B. C., hurled themselves\r\nupon Bactria” (see the notes to p. 119 : 13). “The Sacæ were then\r\nmasters of it and their dispossession resulted in pressing them in part\r\ninto India where they founded a kingdom and also in part into the\r\nPro-Pamirian valleys, especially that of the Oxus. The Yuë-Tchi ruled\r\nover central Asia until 425 A. D. They were dispossessed in their turn\r\nby the Hoas, or Ephtalite Huns” (White Huns).\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the chapter, pp. 287–291 is concerned with Turkestan,\r\nthe Wu-Suns, Huns, Kirghizes, etc.\r\n\r\n224 : 13. Deniker, 2, pp. 59 and 371, says the Ainus are dolichocephalic\r\nand have in addition other Nordic traits. See also Haddon, 1, pp. 8,\r\n15–16, 49–50, Ratzel and others. The Ainus are, according to Darwin,\r\n_Descent of Man_, p. 852, the hairiest people in the world.\r\n\r\n224 : 19. See the notes to pp. 31: 16–32 : 4.\r\n\r\n224 : 28.

C.) the Hittite power was declining and\r\nnorthwestern Asia Minor as far as the valley of the Sangarius, was\r\nwrested from their rule by swarms of new invaders from Europe. These\r\nwere the Phrygians to whose race the Dardanians belonged and who were so\r\nclosely akin to the Thracians that we may speak of the Phrygo-Thracian\r\ndivision of the Indo-European family.” On p. 44 we read: “The dynasty\r\nfrom which the Homeric kings, Agamemnon and Menelaus sprang, was founded\r\naccording to Greek tradition, early in the 13th century (B. C.) by\r\nPelops, a Phrygian. Agamemnon and Menelaus represent the Achæan\r\nstock.... The meaning of this Phrygian relationship is not clear.” But\r\nif we follow the extent of the Achæan invasions and the relation of the\r\nart and language of archaic Phrygia to archaic Greece, the difficulty\r\nseems solved. See Hall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 475. The\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ (Phrygia) says: “According to unvarying Greek\r\ntradition the Phrygians were most closely akin to certain tribes of\r\nMacedonia and Thrace; and their near relationship to the Hellenic stock\r\nis proved by all that is known of their language and art, and is\r\naccepted by almost every modern authority.... The inference has been\r\ngenerally drawn that the Phrygians belonged to a stock widespread in the\r\ncountries which lie around the Ægean Sea. There is, however, no\r\nconclusive evidence whether this stock came from the east, over Armenia,\r\nor was European in origin and crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor;\r\nbut modern opinion inclines decidedly to the latter view”; and we may\r\nadd that the recently demonstrated linguistic affiliations strengthen\r\nthis assumption.

Von Luschan, p. 243, says: “All western Asia was originally\r\ninhabited by a homogeneous, melanochroic race, with extreme\r\nhypsi-brachycephaly and with a ‘Hittite’ nose. About 4000 B. C. began a\r\nSemitic invasion from the southeast, probably from Arabia, by people\r\nlooking like modern Bedawy. 2000 years later commenced a second\r\ninvasion, this time from the northwest by xanthochrous and long-headed\r\ntribes like the modern Kurds, and perhaps connected with the historic\r\nHarri, Amorites, Tamahu and Galatians.\r\n\r\n“The modern ‘Turks,’ Greeks and Jews are all three equally composed of\r\nthese three elements, the Hititte, the Semitic, and the xanthochrous\r\nNordic. Not so the Armenians and Persians. They, and still more, the\r\nDruses, Maronites, and the smaller sectarian groups of Syria and Asia\r\nMinor, represent the old Hittite element, and are little, or not at all,\r\ninfluenced by the somatic characters of alien invaders.”\r\n\r\nVon Luschan means by Persians, the round-headed Medic element, which has\r\nalways been in the majority and which has, at the present day,\r\npractically submerged the once powerful, dominant Nordic class, which he\r\nsays is still seen not rarely in some old noble families.\r\n\r\n225 : 20. Until rather recently nothing much was known about the wild\r\nKurdish tribes living in southeast Anatolia, and what reports there\r\nwere, were frequently conflicting. There are two kinds of Kurds, dark\r\nand light. More data has gradually accumulated, however, and it seems\r\nthat the true Kurds are tall, blond people, who resemble very much the\r\ninhabitants of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nRatzel, _History of Mankind_, says, quoting Polak: “The Kurds are, in\r\ncolor of skin, hair and eyes, so little different to the northern,\r\nespecially the Teutonic breed, that they might easily be taken for\r\nGermans. There is nothing to contradict this racial affinity in the\r\nreputation for honor and courage, which in spite of their rapacious\r\ntendencies, the Kurds enjoy wherever it has been found possible to\r\ncompel them to labor or to the trade of arms. In Persia the Shah\r\nentrusts the security of his person to Kurdish officers rather than to\r\nany others. Their loyalty to their hereditary Wali, which neither Turks\r\nnor Persians have been able to shake, is also noted with praise. The\r\nKurd prefers to wander with his herds and in the winter lives in caves\r\nlike Xenophon’s Carduchi.... The Kurds are a highly mixed race of a type\r\nchiefly Iranian, which has been compared with the Afghan but is not\r\nhomogeneous. The eastern Kurds must have received a larger infusion of\r\nTurkish blood than the western. ‘Husbandmen by necessity, fighters by\r\ninclination.’ says Moltke, ‘the Arab is more of a thief, the Kurd more\r\nof a warrior.’ They are a vigorous, violent race, running wild in tribal\r\nfeuds and vendettas.... Their women hold a freer position than those of\r\nthe Turks and Persians.” The quotation is from vol. III, p. 537.\r\n\r\nVon Luschan, _op. cit._, p. 229, describes them thus: “[They] have long\r\nheads and generally blue eyes and fair hair. They are probably descended\r\nfrom the Kardouchoi and Gordyæans of old historians. They live southeast\r\nof the Armenian mountains. The western Kurds are dolichocephalic and\r\nmore than half of them are fair. The eastern Kurds are little known but\r\nare apparently darker and more round-headed.”\r\n\r\nSoane, in _To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise_, gives a very full\r\ndescription of them, confirming the above. There are so many tribes\r\ndiffering from one another, that only the briefest summary may be given.\r\nIt is found on pp. 398 _seq._ “Judged as specimens of the human form,\r\nthere is probably no higher standard extant that that of the Kurds. The\r\nnortherner is a tall, thin man (obesity is absolutely unknown among the\r\nKurds). The nose is long, thin and often a little hooked, the mouth\r\nsmall, the face oval and long. The men usually grow a long moustache,\r\nand invariably shave the beard. The eyes are piercing and fierce. Among\r\nthem are many of yellow hair and bright blue eyes; and the Kurdish\r\ninfant of this type, were he placed among a crowd of English children,\r\nwould be indistinguishable from them, for he has a white skin. In the\r\nsouth the face is a little broader sometimes, and the frame heavier. Of\r\nforty men of the southern tribes taken at random, there were nine under\r\nsix feet, though among some tribes the average height is five feet nine.\r\nThe stride is long and slow, and the endurance of hardship great. They\r\nhold themselves as only mountain men can do, proudly and erect.... Many\r\nand many a man have I seen among them who might have stood for the\r\npicture of a Norseman. Yellow, flowing hair, a long drooping moustache,\r\nblue eyes, and a fair skin—one of the most convincing proofs, if\r\nphysiognomy be a criterion (were their language not a further proof),\r\nthat the Anglo-Saxon and Kurd are one and the same stock.” For a list of\r\nKurdish tribes and their numbers and affiliations see Mark Sykes, vol.\r\nXXXVIII of the _Jour. of the Roy. Anth. Soc. of Great Britain and\r\nIreland_, and Von Luschan, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nFrom all this evidence by men who have travelled among them it would\r\nappear that the Kurds are descendants of some ancient Nordic invaders\r\nwho have found refuge in the mountain regions north of Mesopotamia.\r\n_Cf._ the note to p. 239 : 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER XI. RACIAL APTITUDES\r\n\r\n226 : 7. Conklin, in _Heredity and Environment_, p. 207, says:\r\n“Psychological characters appear to be inherited in the same way that\r\nanatomical and physiological traits are; indeed, all that has been said\r\nregarding the correlation of morphological and physiological characters\r\napplies also to psychological ones. No one doubts that particular\r\ninstincts, aptitudes and capacities are inherited among both animals and\r\nmen, nor that different races and species differ hereditarily in\r\npsychological characteristics. The general tendency of recent work on\r\nheredity is unmistakable, whether it concerns man or lower animals. The\r\nentire organism, consisting of structures and functions, body and mind,\r\ndevelops out of the germ, and the organization of the germ determines\r\nall the possibilities of development of the mind no less than of the\r\nbody, though the actual realization of any possibility is dependent also\r\nupon environmental stimuli.”\r\n\r\n_Cf._ Haeckel, _The Riddle of the Universe_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n226 : 17.

It may be interesting in this connection to quote Fleure and\r\nJames, pp. 118–119, who, after giving illustrations of Mediterranean\r\ntypes, say of them: “Types 1(a) to 1(c) contribute considerable numbers\r\nto the ministries of the various churches, possibly in part from\r\ninherent and racial leanings, but partly also because these are the\r\npeople of the Moorlands. The idealism of such people usually expresses\r\nitself in music, poetry, literature and religion, rather than in\r\narchitecture, painting and plastic arts generally. They rarely have a\r\nsufficiency of material resources for the latter activities. These types\r\nalso contribute a number of men to the medical profession, for somewhat\r\nsimilar reasons, no doubt.\r\n\r\n“The successful commercial men, who have given the Welsh their\r\nextraordinarily prominent place in British trade (shipping firms, for\r\nexample), usually belong to types 2 or 4” [Nordic and Nordic-Alpine,\r\nBeaker Maker], “rather than to 1, as also do the great majority of Welsh\r\nmembers of Parliament, though there are exceptions of the first\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n“The Nordic type is marked by ingenuity and enterprise in striking out\r\nnew lines. Type 2(c)” [Beaker Maker] “in Wales is remarkable for\r\ngovernmental ability of the administrative kind as well as for\r\nindependence of thought and critical power.”\r\n\r\nThe following remarks are taken from Beddoe, 4, p. 142: “In opposition\r\nto the current opinion it would seem that the Welsh rise most in\r\ncommerce, the Scotch coming after them and the Irish nowhere. The people\r\nof Welsh descent and name hold their own fairly in science; the Scotch\r\ndo more, the Irish less. But when one looks to the attainment of\r\nmilitary or political distinction, the case is altered. Here the\r\nScotchmen, and especially the Highlanders bear away the palm; the Irish\r\nretrieve their position and the Welsh are little heard of.”\r\n\r\nSee also p. 10 of Beddoe’s _Races of Britain_, and Hector McLean in vol.\r\nIV, pp. 218 _seq._ of the _Anthropological Review_ and elsewhere. The\r\nfollowing quotation from Hall’s _Ancient History of the Near East_ is\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n“Knowing what we do of the psychological peculiarities of the different\r\nraces of mankind, it is perhaps not an illegitimate speculation to\r\nwonder whence the Greeks inherited this sense of proportion in their\r\nwhole mental outlook. The feeling of Hellenes for art in general was\r\nsurely inherited from their forebears on the Ægean, not the\r\nIndo-European side.[7] The feeling for naturalistic art, for truth of\r\nrepresentation, may have come from the Ægeans, but the equally\r\ncharacteristic love of the crude and bizarre was not inherited: the\r\nsense of proportion inhibited it. In fact, we may ascribe this sense to\r\nthe Aryan element in the Hellenic brain, to which must also be\r\nattributed the Greek political sense, the idea of the rights of the folk\r\nand of the individual in it.[8] The Mediterranean possessed the artistic\r\nsense without the sense of proportion: the Aryan had little artistic\r\nsense but had the sense of proportion and justice, and with it the\r\npolitical sense. The result of the fusion of the two races we see in the\r\ntrue canon of taste and beauty in all things that had become the ideal\r\nof the Greeks,[9] and was through them to become the ideal of mankind.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  “We have only to look around and seek, vainly, for any self-developed\r\n  artistic feeling among the pure Indo-Europeans. The Kassites had none\r\n  and blighted that of Babylonia for centuries: the Persians had none\r\n  and merely adopted that of Assyria: the Goths and Vandals had none:\r\n  the Celts and Teutons have throughout the centuries derived theirs\r\n  from the Mediterranean region.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The predominance of the Aryan element in Greek political ideas is\r\n  obvious. It is not probable that the old Ægean had any more definite\r\n  political ideas than had his relative the Egyptian.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  “In matters of political and ordinary justice between man and man they\r\n  fell short of their ideal often enough, but they had the reasonable\r\n  ideal: the barbarians had none. The Egyptians were an imaginative\r\n  race, but their imagination was untrammelled by the sense of\r\n  proportion: their only thinker with reasonable and logical ideas,\r\n  Akhenaten, soon became as mad a fanatic as any unreasonable Nitrian\r\n  monk or Arab Mahdi. Ordinarily speaking, Egyptian and Semitic ideals\r\n  were purely religious, and so, to the Greek mind, beyond the domain of\r\n  reason. The Babylonians, Assyrians, and Phœnicians cannot be said ever\r\n  to have possessed any ideals of any kind.”\r\n\r\n229 : 22. Fleure and James, p. 146, say: “In the folk tales, it is true,\r\nthe people are called fairies but colouring is mentioned only in one\r\ncase—that is of a trader from the sea who is said to be fair; _i. e._,\r\nfair hair is treated as something worthy of special mention. The fairy\r\nchildren (changelings) are always described in such a way as to suggest\r\nthat they were dark, and that they were the children of the Upland-folk\r\nof our hypothesis—_i. e._, mostly of Mediterranean race. In the romances\r\nthe princes and princesses are said to be fair, as though that were\r\nexceptional. Our friend, Mr. J. H. Shaxby, draws our attention to the\r\nprobability that the word fair in ‘fair’ or ‘fair-folk’ does not refer\r\nto physical traits, but is an adulatory term such as men so generally\r\nuse in describing beings about whom their superstitions gather.”\r\n\r\n230 : 5. Pope Gregory, about 578 A. D.\r\n\r\n230 : 9. For evidence as to the blond characters of Christ and the\r\nindications of His descent, see Haeckel, _The Riddle of the Universe_,\r\nchap. XVII.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then some reference to this question is noted in the daily\r\npapers. Not long ago, in one of the large New York dailies, there\r\nappeared a short paragraph concerning the letter of Lentulus. All\r\nmention of the extremely doubtful authenticity of this letter was\r\nomitted. The _Catholic Cyclopædia_, vol. IX, discusses the matter as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPublius Lentulus, A fictitious person said to have been the governor of\r\nJudea before Pontius Pilate and to have written the following letter to\r\nthe Roman Senate: “Lentulus, the Governor of the Jerusalemites, to the\r\nRoman Senate and People, greetings. There has appeared in our times and\r\nthere still lives, a man of great power (virtue), called Jesus Christ.\r\nThe people call him prophet of truth; his disciples son of God. He\r\nraises the dead, and heals infirmities. He is a man of medium size\r\n(_statura procerus, mediocris et spectabilis_); he has a venerable\r\naspect, and his beholders can both fear and love him. His hair is of the\r\ncolor of the ripe hazel nut, straight down to the ears, but below the\r\nears wavy and curled, with a bluish and bright reflection flowing over\r\nhis shoulders. It is parted in two on the top of the head, after the\r\npattern of the Nazarenes. His brow is smooth and very cheerful, with a\r\nface without a wrinkle or spot, embellished by a slightly ruddy\r\ncomplexion. His nose and mouth are faultless. His beard is abundant, of\r\nthe color of his hair, not long, but divided at the chin. His aspect is\r\nsimple and mature, his eyes are changeable and bright. He is terrible in\r\nhis reprimands, sweet and amiable in his admonitions, cheerful without\r\nloss of gravity. He was never known to laugh, but often to weep. His\r\nstature is straight, his hands and arms beautiful to behold. His\r\nconversation is grave, infrequent and modest. He is the most beautiful\r\namong the children of men.” The letter was first printed in _The Life of\r\nChrist_, by Ludolph the Carthusian, at Cologne, 1474. According to the\r\nmanuscript of Jena, a certain Giacomo Colonna found the letter in an\r\nancient Roman document sent to Rome from Constantinople. It must be of\r\nGreek origin and have been translated into Latin during the thirteenth\r\nor fourteenth century, though it received its present form at the hands\r\nof a humanist of the fifteenth or sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe description agrees with the so-called Abgar picture of Our Lord. It\r\nalso agrees with the portrait of Jesus Christ drawn by Nicephorus, St.\r\nJohn Damascene, and the Book of Painters (of Mt. Athos). Munter, (_Die\r\nSinnbilder und Kunstvorstellungen der alten Christen_, Altona, 1825, p.\r\n9), believes he can trace the letter down to the time of Diocletian, but\r\nthis is not generally admitted. The Letter of Lentulus is certainly\r\napocryphal; there never was a governor of Jerusalem; no procurator of\r\nJudea is known to have been called Lentulus; a Roman governor would not\r\nhave addressed the Senate, but the Emperor; a Roman writer would not\r\nhave employed the expressions, “prophet of truth,” “sons of men,” “Jesus\r\nChrist.” The former two are Hebrew idioms, the third is taken from the\r\nNew Testament. The letter, therefore, shows us a description of Our Lord\r\nsuch as Christian piety conceived him.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable literature touching on this letter, for which see\r\nthe _Catholic Cyclopædia_. Although we cannot credit the letter as\r\ngenuine, it is interesting, as the article indicated, in showing the\r\npopular attitude to the traits in question, and in attributing these\r\nNordic characters to Christ, as are the occasional efforts to bring the\r\nmatter up again in the journals of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XII.

The Messapians, according to Ridgeway, 1, p. 347, were the\r\nremnants of the primitive Ligurians, who once occupied central Italy but\r\nwho migrated, under the pressure of the Umbrians, toward the south.\r\nThere some of them survived under the name Iapyges or Messapians, in the\r\nheel of the peninsula. “The name Iapyges seems identical with that of\r\nthe Iapodes, that Illyrian tribe which dwelt on the other side of the\r\nAdriatic, largely contaminated with the Celts (Nordics) who had flowed\r\ndown over them. That the Umbrians had a deadly hatred of a people of the\r\nsame name, who had survived in their coast area, is proved by the\r\nIguvine Tables, where the _Iapuzkum numen_ is heartily cursed along with\r\nthe Etruscans and the men of Nar.”\r\n\r\nSee also Giuffrida-Ruggeri.\r\n\r\n234 : 3 _seq._ See the notes to pp. 157 : 10 and 157 : 14.\r\n\r\n234 : 7.

As a result of the\r\nepoch-making study of Keltic by Professor J. Morris Jones, of the\r\nUniversity College, Bangor, Wales, which appears as Appendix B, in Rhys\r\nand Jones, _The Welsh People_, pp. 616–641, the assertion is made that\r\nBasque is apparently allied to Berber, and that other problems hitherto\r\nunsolved may be unravelled.

See the notes above, to p. 234 : 24.\r\n\r\n235 : 17. Liguria and the Ligurian language. Sergi, 4; Ripley, chap. X.\r\nThe modern Liguria comprises virtually the coast lands of Italy around\r\nthe Gulf of Genoa as far south as Pisa. For ancient Liguria, which once\r\nextended into Gaul, see Déchellette, _Manuel d’archéologie_, t. II, pp.\r\n6–25. D’Arbois de Jubainville treats of the Ligurians at length in\r\nseveral of his works mentioned, but Déchellette shows his wrong\r\nreasoning, rather convincingly it seems to the author. The opinions of\r\nJullian, as given in his _Histoire de la Gaule_, are also discussed by\r\nDéchellette. A full discussion in English, of all the authorities on\r\nancient Liguria, the Ligurians and their language is given in Rice\r\nHolmes, _Cæsar’s Conquest of Gaul_, pp. 277–287. The language is treated\r\non pp. 281–284, and 318, and by Peet, _The Stone and Bronze Ages in\r\nItaly_, pp. 164 _seq._; see also D’Arbois de Jubainville, 3, pp. 152\r\n_seq._ Feist, 5, p. 369, says that the Ligurians were Mediterraneans. A\r\nnumber of others agree with him. The evidence points rather to their\r\nhaving been an early Alpine people, somewhat less brachycephalic than\r\nthose who came later, and this is the opinion held by Ratzel, vol. III,\r\np. 561. The name Ligurian in this book designates a Pre-Nordic race of\r\nAlpine affinities, with a Pre-Aryan language.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar and discontinuous distribution of Alpine peoples with names\r\nwhich are variations of the term Veneti, a condition rather analogous to\r\nthe scattered groups of Pelasgians as noted by various authors of\r\nantiquity, may indicate the last traces of a once widely distributed\r\nrace. It is possible that the Ligurians displaced these “Veneti” in\r\nsouthern Europe, and later became confined to a part of Gaul and\r\nnorthern Italy.\r\n\r\n235 : 23.

The history of the Hittite Empire has been brought\r\nto light by the research and investigations of Professor Sayce. See his\r\n_Hittites_. There are a number of short general descriptions in\r\npractically all of the histories of ancient peoples, and in those of the\r\nNear East. See for instance, Bury, _History of Greece_, pp. 45, 64;\r\nHall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, pp. 200, 334 seq.; Myres,\r\n_Dawn of History_, pp. 118 seq., 152 _seq._ and 199 seq.; Myers,\r\n_Ancient History_, pp. 91–93; Feist, _Kultur_, pp. 406 _seq._; Von\r\nLuschan, pp. 242–243; and Zaborowski, 1, pp. 121, 134, 138 and 160, deal\r\nmore with the physical characters of the Hittites.\r\n\r\nAccording to some of the most recent authorities, the Hittites were an\r\nextraordinarily powerful nation and held Syria from about 3700 B. C. to\r\n700 B. C., when the Assyrians overcame them. They had some contact with\r\nBabylon and probably their development was influenced thereby. They seem\r\nto have been the Kheta or Khatti of the Ancient Egyptians. “About 1280\r\nB. C.,” according to Von Luschan, “when Khattusil made his peace with\r\nRameses II, there existed a large empire, not much smaller than Germany,\r\nreaching from the Ægean Sea to Mesopotamia and from Kadesh on the\r\nOrontes to the Black Sea. We do not know at present if this Hittite\r\nEmpire ever had a really homogeneous population, but we have a good many\r\nHittite reliefs and all these, without one single exception, show us the\r\nhigh and short heads, or the characteristic noses of our modern\r\nbrachycephalic groups, (Armenoids).”\r\n\r\nAs to their language, J. D. Prince, correspondence, says that it was not\r\nAryan, in spite of all conjectures to the contrary. “Friedrich Delitzsch\r\nanalyzed some of the only syllabized material we have of this language,\r\nand I analyzed it still further in the _Journal of the American Oriental\r\nSociety_, vol. XXII, ‘Hittite Material in the Cuneiform Inscriptions,’\r\nreaching the conclusion as to the Non-Aryan character of this idiom. The\r\nso-called ‘Hittite Inscriptions’ are in hieroglyphs and give us no clue\r\nas to the pronunciation and hence none to the character of the\r\nlanguage.” Von Luschan, p. 242, says: “Orientalists are unanimous in\r\nassuming that the Hittite language was not Semitic.” A very recent\r\ncommunication from Fr. Cumont, in _L’Académie des inscriptions et belles\r\nlettres_ for April 20, 1917, says that the tongue is proved to have been\r\nAryan.\r\n\r\nAs to their physical characters, all are agreed that the Hittites had\r\nshort, brachycephalic heads, and thick, prominent noses. Myres, p. 44,\r\nremarks that the earliest portraits, which he dates about 1285 B. C.,\r\nhave been thought by some to be Mongoloid, but the evidence is still\r\nscanty and inconclusive. Surely if the older likenesses were Mongoloid,\r\nthey bear no resemblance to the later types. On the monuments bearded\r\nfigures are frequent and the type is Armenoid. See Hall, _The Ancient\r\nHistory of the Near East_, p. 334, for a criticism of the Mongol theory.\r\n\r\n239 : 10. Sumer. J. D. Prince, in his article on the Sumerians in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_, classes the Sumerian language as\r\nagglutinative. The language of Susiana is also known as Anzanite, Susian\r\nor Elamite. The Anzanite may have been a dialect of Susian. Schiel’s\r\nwork with de Morgan’s mission shows that Elamite was agglutinative and\r\nthat inflections found in derived words are due to the influence of\r\nanother language. The locality of Anzan is not known exactly, but is\r\nbelieved to have been in the plain south or southeast of Susa. See also\r\nZaborowski, 1, pp. 149–150, and Hall, _The Ancient History of the Near\r\nEast_. Hall agrees with Prince that Sumerian is agglutinative (p. 171).\r\nHe also states that Elamite was agglutinative, but not otherwise like\r\nSumerian. See his chap. V for the relationships of Sumerians and\r\nElamites.\r\n\r\nFor Media see the notes to p. 254 : 13.\r\n\r\n239 : 12. Assyria and Palestine. Breasted, _Ancient Times_, p. 173 and\r\nFig. 112; Hall, _History of the Near East_; Myres, _Dawn of History_,\r\npp. 114–116, 140; and other histories of the Near East.\r\n\r\n239 : 13. Kassites. See Hall, pp. 198–200. Very little is known about\r\nthe Kassites. Hall declares that there is very little doubt but that\r\nthey were Indo-European; Prince, from the same information, says this\r\ncould not possibly be the case. They are supposed to have been an\r\nElamite tribe who were living in the northwestern mountains of Elam,\r\nimmediately south of Holwan, when Sennacherib attacked them in 702 B. C.\r\nThey attacked Babylonia in the ninth year of Samsu-iluma, the son of\r\nKhammurabi, overran it and founded a dynasty there in 1780 B. C., which\r\nlasted 576 years. They became absorbed into the Babylonian population;\r\nthe kings adopted Semitic names and married into the royal family of\r\nAssyria. Like the other languages of the Non-Semitic tribes of Elam,\r\naccording to Prince, that of the Kassites was agglutinative. That the\r\nKassites had been in contact with the horse-using nomads of the northern\r\nsteppes, is indicated by the fact that they first introduced the horse\r\ninto Mesopotamian lands, whence its use for riding and drawing chariots\r\nspread into Egypt in 1700 B. C. See Breasted, _Ancient Times_, p. 138.\r\n\r\n239 : 16. Mitanni. Very little is known of the Mitanni. Von Luschan, p.\r\n230, dates them around the fourteenth century B. C. In 1380 they called\r\nthemselves Harri, from Harri-ya, an old form of the word Aryan. Myres,\r\n_Dawn of History_, says: “The conquest of Syria in 1500 B. C. brought\r\nEgypt face to face with a homogeneous state called Mitanni, occupying\r\nthe whole foothill country east of the Euphrates.... The Egyptian\r\nconquest came just in time to relieve the kingdom of Mitanni from severe\r\npressure exerted simultaneously and probably in collusion, by its\r\nneighbors in the foothills,—Assyria on the east, and the Hittites west\r\nof the Euphrates. Egypt made friends with Mitanni and more than one\r\nmarriage was arranged between the royal houses. Soon after the treaty\r\nbetween Egypt and Mitanni, Subiluliuma, king of the Hittites of\r\nCappadocia, whom Egyptian scribes conveniently abbreviate as Saplel, was\r\noverlord apparently of a number of outpost baronies in north Syria.\r\nAssured of their help, and watching his opportunity, he flung his whole\r\nforce, about 1400 upon Mitanni.... This closed the career of Mitanni.”\r\n\r\nThe racial affinities of Mitanni are doubtful. Prince, correspondence,\r\nsays the language of Mitanni was certainly not Aryan. It has been\r\nthoroughly analyzed by Ferdinand Bork, in his _Die Mitanni Sprache_, who\r\ncompares it with the Georgian or Imeretian branch of the Caucasic\r\nlinguistic groups. The Mitanni are not to be confused with the Ossetes,\r\nwho speak a highly archaic, real Aryan language. Mitanni, in structure,\r\nis like the polysynthetic North American groups. Feist, 1, p. 14, says\r\nthe Mitanni were Nordics and inhabited the western mountains of Iran, in\r\nZagros. In 5, p. 406, he places them on the north of the Euphrates\r\nduring the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries B. C. See also Hall, p.\r\n200, the following note and that to p. 213 : 1–23 of this book. Hall\r\nalso considers them Nordics.\r\n\r\n239 : 16 _seq._ Von Luschan, p. 230, asks: “Can it be mere accident that\r\na few miles north of the actual frontier of modern Kurdish languages\r\nthere is Boghaz-Köi, the old metropolis of the Hittite Empire, where\r\nHugo Winckler in 1908 found tablets with two political treaties of King\r\nSubiluliuma with Mattiuaza, son of Tušrata, king of Mitanni, and in both\r\nof these treaties Aryan divinities, Mithra, Varuna, Indra and Nasatya\r\nare invoked, together with Hittite divinities, as witnesses and\r\nprotectors? And in the same inscriptions, which date from about 1380 B.\r\nC., the king of Mitanni and his people are called Harri, just as nine\r\ncenturies later in the Achæmenidian inscriptions Xerxes and Darius call\r\nthemselves Har-ri-ya, ‘Aryans of Aryan stock.’ So the Kurds,” concludes\r\nVon Luschan, “are the descendants of Aryan invaders and have maintained\r\ntheir type and their language for more than 3300 years.”\r\n\r\nSee also the notes to p. 173 : 11.\r\n\r\n239 : 29.

ORIGIN OF THE ARYAN LANGUAGES\r\n\r\n242 : 5. The following notes on languages were taken mostly from the\r\n_History of Language_, by Henry Sweet, and were supplemented by the\r\nwritings of W. D. Whitney, and an article on “Indo-European Languages,”\r\nby Peter Giles.\r\n\r\nAll languages may be roughly divided into two great groups, _isolating_\r\nand _agglutinative_.\r\n\r\nThe isolating languages are constructed on the principle of single,\r\ndistinct words for each idea, and do not employ forms which add or drop\r\nsyllables, or letters, in order to obtain variety of expression, tense,\r\nmode, person, number, etc. However, the element of intonation frequently\r\nplays a large part in multiplying the number of possible forms, and\r\ntherefore of ideas, in isolating languages, by imparting to otherwise\r\nidentical words different meanings through pitch, rising or falling\r\ninflection or accent.\r\n\r\nTo the isolating languages belong most of those of southeastern\r\nAsia,—Chinese, Burmese, Siamese, Thibetan, Annamite, Cochin-Chinese,\r\nMalayan, etc. The term isolating does not necessarily imply words of one\r\nsyllable, although there is a tendency in this direction since the roots\r\nare stripped of all incumbrances of a modifying nature so common in\r\nagglutinative or synthetic languages. The Chinese, Burmese, Siamese and\r\nAnnamite are classed as monosyllabic, the Thibetan as half-monosyllabic,\r\nwhile the Malay is polysyllabic.\r\n\r\nBecause languages are isolating in structure does not mean that they\r\nnecessarily all belong to one family. They merely have this structural\r\nprinciple in common. To establish family relationships it is necessary\r\nto investigate the sets of phonetics used, the root forms, the types of\r\nideas expressed, the composition of the sentence and various other\r\nimportant points included under the psychology of habit and growth forms\r\nof speech. No one of these alone is ordinarily sufficient to prove that\r\ntwo languages are of one common stock, since extensive borrowing of all\r\nkinds has occurred since time immemorial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in point of fact, taking languages as they now exist, only\r\nthose have been shown related which possess a common structure, or have\r\ntogether grown out of the more primitive radical stage, since structure\r\nproves itself a more constant and reliable evidence than vocabulary.\r\nBut, on the other hand, since all structure is the result of growth, and\r\nany degree of difference of structure, as well as of difference of\r\nmaterial, may be explained as the result of discordant growth from\r\nidentical beginnings, it is equally inadmissible to claim that the\r\ndiversities of languages prove them to have had different beginnings.\r\n\r\nIn isolating languages, word order is very important, but here again the\r\npeculiar character of any tongue of this type depends upon the order\r\nselected, or the relative importance of ideas (general, specific, etc.).\r\nThe employment of particles makes possible a freer word order.\r\n\r\nThe _agglutinative_ languages are those which combine roots or parts of\r\nwords or elements into new wholes to express other related ideas than\r\nthose imparted by the single forms, or else entirely new concepts.\r\nFrequently these combinations are still separable on occasion into their\r\noriginal elements, or, if inseparable in their secondary meanings, their\r\noriginal parts with their derivations are still recognizable as such.\r\nAgain, the component parts are no longer independent, but form a firmly\r\nknit whole.\r\n\r\nIn some languages certain classes of elements have arisen which may be\r\nadded in a perfectly formal manner to other fixed roots or elements,\r\nwith or without slight phonetic modifications of either or both parts.\r\nSince this occurs in conformity with fairly fixed rules, the meanings of\r\nthe resultant combinations are, according to the class of the attached\r\nelements used, fairly analogous. Thus in English many verb roots obtain\r\nthe present participle by the addition of the formal element _ing_, in\r\nitself now meaningless, but once, no doubt, a separate root.\r\n\r\nThe process of agglutination may be accomplished in many different ways,\r\nany of which may be characteristic of whole groups of unrelated\r\nlanguages. These may be roughly divided first into mono- or\r\noligo-synthetic and polysynthetic. The former very nearly approach the\r\nisolating languages, since usually only one element may be added at a\r\ntime, but the process of addition may be accomplished in any of the ways\r\npossible to agglutination.\r\n\r\nAgglutination includes prefixing, suffixing and infixing in all degrees\r\nof complexity and fixity. Thus languages may be spoken of as\r\nagglutinative only in a relative sense. Some are much more so than\r\nothers, both in point of the number of elements which it is possible to\r\nadd, and their dependence upon one another and the root, denoting a\r\nhigher or lower degree of inextricability in blending.\r\n\r\nMany languages are only loosely agglutinative and the component parts of\r\nthe compounds readily resolve. In others, as in the inflecting\r\nlanguages, the combination is inextricable.\r\n\r\nThus under the head of agglutinative we have the merely agglutinative or\r\nsynthetic, readily resolvable combinations, which are often hardly\r\ndistinguishable from isolating languages, and the less easily divisible\r\ninflectional and incorporating types. Any or all of the three processes\r\nof infixing, prefixing and suffixing may be employed in simple\r\nagglutinative combinations.\r\n\r\nIn inflectional languages the root is attended by prefixes or suffixes\r\nwhich form inseparable modifiers. At times phonetic changes occur which\r\nrender the complex unlike the simple joining of its component parts.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sweet says: “If we define inflection as ‘agglutination run mad’\r\nwe may regard incorporation as inflection run madder still, for it is\r\nthe result of attempting to develop a verb into a complete sentence.” In\r\nsome languages, such as the incorporating, a verb is sufficiently\r\ndistinct in its meaning not to require an independent pronoun. French\r\nand Spanish, though not belonging to this category, contain words with\r\nthe incorporating idea, as in Spanish _hablo_, I speak, and French,\r\n_pluit_, it rains. Where polysynthesism is the prevailing character, the\r\nverb may be sufficiently comprehensive to include the objective pronoun\r\nas well as the subjective, so that it is possible to find in one word a\r\ntransitive, as well as in others an intransitive, sentence. But this is\r\nonly rudimentary incorporation, and borders on inflection. Some American\r\nIndian languages carry it to a very high degree, appending to or\r\ninserting into this simple complex not only nouns which may stand in\r\napposition to the implied or actual pronouns, but particles and\r\nmodifiers of every description. (See the _Handbook of American Indian\r\nLanguages_, published by the Bureau of American Ethnology at\r\nWashington.) Frequently during this process various parts undergo\r\nphonetic changes in accordance with fixed laws, so that the final\r\ncomplex may not at all resemble a string of the original elements, but\r\nbecomes a new, inseparable and fixed word containing a whole sentence of\r\nideas. This sentence, in some languages, may carry throughout certain\r\nmodifiers for all noun elements—for instance, as to whether the objects\r\nunder discussion are visible or invisible. These modifiers bear definite\r\nrelationships to the nouns, and the “sentence word” in each of its parts\r\nmust then be conjugated as a verb in an even more complicated manner.\r\nThis is agglutination par excellence, and is frequently so complex as to\r\nbe utterly bewildering to the Indo-European mind, even though the\r\nIndo-European languages themselves employ agglutination to a limited\r\ndegree and of certain varieties, particularly of the inflectional order.\r\n\r\nCompared to the most complicated Indian tongues, English is in the\r\nposition of Chinese to Indo-European languages in its structural\r\nsimplicity, though of course in Chinese we have an added complexity in\r\nthe use of pitch, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are certain types of speech which secure changes (plurals, etc.)\r\nby internal vowel modification. English itself makes use of this device,\r\nbut it is the outstanding feature of Semitic tongues.\r\n\r\nSweet says: “There are many other minor criteria of morphological\r\nclassification. The most important of these is perhaps that of the\r\nagglutinative or inflectional elements before or after the word or stem\r\n[modified]. In Turkish and in other Altaic languages, as also in\r\nFinnish, these are always post-positions, so that every word begins with\r\nthe root which always has chief stress. The Bantu languages of South\r\nAfrica, on the other hand, favor prefixes.... The Semitic languages\r\nfavor prefixes and post-positions about equally. The Aryan languages are\r\nmainly post-positional, with occasional use of prefixes, most of which,\r\nhowever, are of later origin.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that languages fall into absolutely distinct\r\ncategories because of their structure. No language to-day is purely of\r\none type or another. There have been too many centuries of borrowing and\r\nchange for that condition to now be possible for any language, nor are\r\nthere any longer what might be called primitive tongues. They have all\r\nlong since outgrown that state, whatever it may have been, even the\r\nBotocudo of Brazil, which is generally ranked as the most primitive.\r\n\r\nLanguages may now be classified only according to their prevailing\r\ntendencies. Thus, modern English is in part isolating, in part\r\ninflectional and in part agglutinative, as that term is generally\r\napplied. Basque is an incorporating language, far removed geographically\r\nand linguistically from any other of that character. The Indo-European\r\nfamily may be considered as inflectional, because that process is a\r\nprominent feature, but it is by no means the only one present, nor is it\r\nexclusively typical of that family.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that all languages pass through certain stages in\r\ntheir development, but it is not at all true that they all have\r\neventually the same or even similar histories. There are endless\r\npossibilities of growth and decay, and this fact alone excludes any set\r\nevolutionary scheme. Nor are the isolating languages the most primitive.\r\nOn the contrary, they are as complex in their way as the most\r\nagglutinative North American tongues, and as expressive, for some\r\npsychological categories.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that all languages have begun on an isolating\r\nprinciple of simple roots for single ideas, from which they have\r\ndiverged in endless variety. Probably all inflectional languages had an\r\nisolating and agglutinative stage, although this is by no means proved.\r\nThe Chinese seems to have undergone an agglutinative past of some sort,\r\nbut to have resolved again into simple roots, with only traces of fuller\r\nforms, but with the added complexity of tone, accent, and order, to\r\ngive, as Sweet puts it, “that extreme of elliptical conciseness and\r\nconcentrated force of expression, which excites our admiration.”\r\n\r\nEnglish has become analytical, for many older inflected words have now\r\nbeen worked over into combinations of independent words, but this is far\r\nfrom a complete or consistent process. Probably it will never become\r\nlike the Chinese, for to do away now with its inflectional system\r\nentirely would necessitate a complete upheaval of structure which is not\r\nlikely to happen in the course of normal inner development, particularly\r\nwith a vast literature to assist in stabilizing present forms.\r\n\r\nAs regards polysynthesism, or amount of agglutination, the Aryan tongues\r\nare intermediate; they allow affixes, but only within certain limits.\r\n\r\nLanguages undoubtedly differ from one another in their richness and\r\npower of expression, but may not be used as a test of the intellectual\r\ncapacity of those who now speak them. In fact, men of any race can learn\r\nany language, unless abnormal. To account for the great and striking\r\ndifference of structure among human languages is beyond the power of the\r\nlinguistic student, and will doubtless always continue so. We are not\r\nlikely to be able even to demonstrate a correlation of capacities,\r\nsaying that a race which has done this and that in other departments\r\nmight have been expected to form such and such a language. Every tongue\r\nrepresents the general outcome of the capacity of a race as exerted in\r\nthis particular direction, under the influence of historical\r\ncircumstances which we can have no hope of tracing, but there are\r\nstriking anomalies to be noted.\r\n\r\n“The Chinese and the Egyptians have shown themselves to be among the\r\nmost gifted races the earth has known; but the Chinese tongue is of\r\nunsurpassed jejuneness, and the Egyptian, in point of structure, little\r\nbetter, while among the wild tribes of Africa and America we find\r\ntongues of every grade up to a high one or the highest. This shows\r\nclearly enough that mental power is not measured by language structure.\r\nOn the whole the value and rank of a language are determined by what its\r\nusers have made it do—a poor tool in skilful hands can do vastly better\r\nwork than the best tool in unskilful hands, even as the ancient\r\nEgyptians, without steel or steam, turned out products which, both for\r\ncolossal grandeur and for exquisite finish, are the despair of modern\r\nengineers and artists.” In other words, we must not underestimate the\r\nimportant part played by habit or inertia. “The formation of habit is\r\nslow, and once formed it exercises a constraining as well as a guiding\r\ninfluence.”\r\n\r\nThe Indo-European language is one of the most highly organized families\r\nof tongues that exist, and its greatest power lies (in modern English,\r\netc.) in its mixed structural and material character. So to the\r\nIndo-European family belongs incontestably the first place, and for many\r\nreasons,—the historical position of the peoples speaking its dialects,\r\nwho have now long been the leaders in world history, the abundance,\r\nvariety and merit of its literatures ancient and modern and, most of\r\nall, the great variety and richness of its development. These have made\r\nit an illustration of the history of human speech, which is extremely\r\nvaluable and the training ground of comparative philology.\r\n\r\nW. D. Whitney gives the following linguistic groups in order of their\r\nimportance from a literary standpoint:\r\n\r\n      1. Indo-European (Indo-Germanic). 2. Semitic. 3. Hamitic. 4.\r\n       Monosyllabic or Southeastern Asiatic. 5. Ural-Altaic (Scythian,\r\n       Turanian). 6. Dravidian or South Indian. 7. Malay-Polynesian. 8.\r\n       Oceanic— _a._ Australian and Tasmanian. _b._ Papuan and Negrito,\r\n       etc. 9. Caucasian— _a._ Circassian. _b._ Mitsjeghian. _c._\r\n       Lesghian, Georgian. 10. European Remnants— Basque. Etruscan?\r\n       Lydian? 11. South African, Bantu. 12. Central African. 13.\r\n       American.\r\n\r\nThe first ten groups are families. So little is or was known about the\r\nlast three groups that the author of the article classed together what\r\nare now known to be vast agglomerations of families. For instance, the\r\nAmerican languages include several hundred distinct stocks, of which\r\nfifty are found in California alone. These are all, according to our\r\npresent knowledge, utterly unrelated. It is known that the central\r\nAfrican tongues belong to a different group than the southern, and it\r\nwould be advisable to consult Sir Harry Johnston’s recent large work on\r\nthe Bantu languages.\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of the Indo-European family into cognate languages is\r\ngiven here to show the great diversity of tongues that may spring from\r\none ancestor. Not all the dialects, nor even languages, have been\r\nincluded, but only those best known:\r\n\r\n I. Centum (European).\r\n   1.

Deniker, 2, p. 320, sums up Hirt’s position on this\r\nquestion in the footnote: “According to Hirt the home of dispersion of\r\nthe primitive Aryan language would be found to the north of the\r\nCarpathians, in the Letto-Lithuanian region. From this point two\r\nlinguistic streams would start flowing around the mountains to the west\r\nand east; the western stream, after spreading over Germany (Teutonic\r\nlanguages), left behind the Celtic languages in the upper valley of the\r\nDanube, and filtered through on the one side into Italy (Latin\r\nlanguages), on the other side into Illyria, Albania, and Greece\r\n(Helleno-Illyrian languages). The eastern stream formed the Slav\r\nlanguages in the plains traversed by the Dnieper, then spread by way of\r\nthe Caucasus into Asia (Iranian languages and Sanscrit). In this way we\r\ncan account, on the one hand, for the less and less marked relationship\r\nbetween the Aryan languages of the present day and the common primitive\r\ndialect, and on the other hand, for the diversity between the two groups\r\nof Aryan languages, western and eastern.”\r\n\r\nIf this were so, Sanskrit should more closely resemble the Slavic than\r\nthe western languages. As it is, the old Vedic speech, the earliest form\r\nof Sanskrit, is said to show more affiliations with Greek than with any\r\nother of the Aryan tongues (see Taylor, 1, p. 21, and authorities\r\nquoted), a fact which merely adds another proof to our hypothesis that\r\nsometime between 2000 and 1500 B. C. the Nordics filtered down the\r\nBalkan peninsula in their earliest wave and about the same time other\r\nbranches found their way into northwestern India. The Sanskrit alphabet\r\nis more closely related to the Phœnician than to any other. At the time\r\nof the first Nordic expansion their language was not reduced to writing.\r\nThe alphabet used for early Sanskrit, was, according to Professor\r\nBühler, probably introduced into India by traders from Mesopotamia about\r\n800 B. C. Another authority on the relations of Greek and Sanskrit is\r\nJohannes Schmidt, _Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Indo-germanischen\r\nSprachen_, Weimar, 1872.\r\n\r\n243 : 4. Prof. J. D. Prince, correspondence, in discussing the kinship\r\nof prehistoric Ugrian to Aryan says that, although it is a temptation to\r\nbelieve in it, there is insufficient data for proving it. As careful a\r\nscholar as Szinnyei, in his _Vergleichende Grammatik der Ugrischen\r\nSprache_, is careful not to commit himself.

See the note to p. 259 : 21.\r\n\r\n254 : 8. Ephtalites, or White Huns. Cahun, _Histoire de l’Asie_, pp.\r\n43–55: “The Turks destroyed in the first half of the seventh century a\r\npowerful nation, the Ephtalites of Soghdiana, north of Persia. They were\r\ncalled Ephtalites, or White Huns or Tie-le-urn Turks.” See also the\r\nnotes to pp. 119 : 15 and 224 : 3 of this book, and chap. XXVI in Gibbon\r\non the Huns in general.\r\n\r\nProcopius, vol. I, says in speaking of the Ephtalite Huns and describing\r\ntheir war with the Persians about 450 A. D.: “The White Huns are of the\r\nstock of the Huns in fact as well as in name, living in the territory\r\nnorth of Persia, and are settlers on the land in contrast to the Nomadic\r\nHuns who live at a distance.... They are the only ones among the Huns\r\nwho have white bodies and countenances that are not ugly and they are\r\nfar more civilized than are the other Huns.” The general impression\r\ngained from Procopius is that they were not true Huns. “Massagetæ” is\r\nused as another name for Huns by Procopius. He describes them as mounted\r\nbowmen. It is clear that in using this name he refers to Huns only.\r\n\r\n254 : 13. Medes. The name Medes is variously applied by different\r\nauthorities; by many the Medes are regarded as a branch of the Persians,\r\none of two kindred tribes of Nordics. The author follows Zaborowski in\r\napplying the name to the round skulled population which was conquered by\r\nthe Persians. See Zaborowski, 1, chaps. V and VI, especially part II and\r\np. 125. Also Herodotus in the references given for Persia. Hall,\r\n_Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 459, gives an interesting bit of\r\ntheir story.\r\n\r\n254 : 15. Persians. The Persians were a branch of Nordics who invaded\r\nthe territory of the round skulled Medes, and gradually imposed their\r\nlanguage and much of their culture on the subjugated populations. See\r\nHerodotus, book I, especially 55, 71, 72, 74, 91, 95, 101, 107, 125,\r\n129, 135, 136; and book VI, 19, where he discusses both Medes and\r\nPersians. For modern commentary the author follows Zaborowski, 1, pp.\r\n138–139, 153 _seq._, chap. VI, and also pp. 212–214.\r\n\r\nVon Luschan, pp. 233–234, describes the present day Persians, showing\r\nthat there has been a resurgence of types and that the Nordic elements\r\nhave been largely absorbed by the original inhabitants. He adds,\r\nhowever, on p. 234, that while he never saw Persians with light hair and\r\nblue eyes, he was told that in some noble families fair types were not\r\nvery rare.\r\n\r\n254 : 19. See the note on the Medes, and Zaborowski, p. 156, on the\r\nMagi.\r\n\r\n254 : 26. Darius. Zaborowski, 1, p. 12. Herodotus, I, 209, says: “Now\r\nHystaspes the son of Arsames was of the race of the Achæmenidæ and his\r\neldest son Darius was at that time twenty years old.” Another name for\r\nHystaspes was Vashtaspa, whose father was Arsames (Arsháma). He traced\r\nhis descent through four ancestors to Achæmenes (Hakhámamish).\r\n\r\nVon Luschan, p. 241, says: “Nothing is known of the Achæmenides who\r\ncalled themselves ‘Aryans of Aryan stock’ and who brought the Aryan\r\nlanguage to Persia. About 1500 B. C. or earlier, there seems to have\r\nbegun a migration of northern men to Asia Minor, Syria, Persia, Egypt\r\nand India. Indeed we can now connect even Further India with the Mitanni\r\nof central Asia Minor.”\r\n\r\nSee Zaborowski in regard to the Behistun tablet, etc., although\r\npractically any writers on Persia and Mesopotamia discuss this great\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n255 : 2.

See chaps. V and VI, especially part II and\r\np. 125. For early data on the Medes see the Herodotus references given\r\nunder Persia. Zaborowski says, p. 121, that Medic was spoken until 600\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n255 : 15. Kurdish. Von Luschan, p. 229: “The Kurds speak an Aryan\r\nlanguage.... The eastern Kurds are little known.... They speak a\r\ndifferent dialect from the western tribes, but both divisions are\r\nAryan.” On the Kurds as a people, see the notes to p. 225 : 20.\r\n\r\n255 : 20.

See Plutarch’s _Life of Alexander_; _Historia\r\nAlexandri Magni de præliis_; Zaborowski, 1, p. 171.\r\n\r\n256 : 3. Alexander the Great and the Persians. Plutarch, _Life of\r\nAlexander_: “After this he accommodated himself more than ever to the\r\nmanners of the Asiatics, and at the same time persuaded them to adopt\r\nsome of the Macedonian fashions, for by a mixture of both he thought a\r\nunion might be promoted much better than by force, and his authority\r\nmaintained when he was at a distance. For the same reason he selected\r\n30,000 boys and gave them masters to instruct them in the Grecian\r\nliterature as well as to train them to arms in the Macedonian manner. As\r\nfor his marriage with Roxana, it was entirely the effect of love.... Nor\r\nwas the match unsuitable to the situation of his affairs. The barbarians\r\nplaced greater confidence in him on account of that alliance....\r\nHephæstion and Craternus were his two favorites. The former praised the\r\nPersian fashions and dressed as he did; the latter adhered to the\r\nfashions of his own country. He therefore employed Hephæstion in his\r\ntransactions with the barbarians and Craternus to signify his pleasure\r\nto the Greeks and Macedonians.”\r\n\r\n256 : 11 _seq._ Armenians. Ridgeway, 1, p. 396, speaking of language,\r\nsays: “That the Armenians were an offshoot of the Phrygians as mentioned\r\nin Herodotus VII, 73, is proved by the most modern linguistic results,\r\nwhich show that Armenian comes closer to Greek than to the Iranian\r\ntongues.” _Cf._ also Hall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 475.\r\nThis need not imply racial affinity, however. The following notes on\r\nArmenian were contributed by Mr. Leon Dominian: “The proof of Aryan\r\naffinities in the Hittite language has not yet been established. The\r\ngreat difficulty in establishing the pre-Aryan relation of Armenian is\r\ndue to the fact that the earliest text dates only from the fifth century\r\nA. D.\r\n\r\n“The Cimmerians and Scythians, coming from southern Europe by way of the\r\nCaucasus (Herodotus, IV, 11, 12), reached Armenia about 720 B. C. (see\r\nGarstang, _The Land of the Hittites_, p. 62). The old Vannic language\r\nantedating this invasion resembles the Georgian of the Caucasus,\r\naccording to Sayce (_Jour. Roy. As. Soc._, XIV, p. 410), who has studied\r\nthe local inscriptions. On p. 409 he infers that the Aryan occupation of\r\nArmenia was coeval with the victory of Aryanism in Persia at the end of\r\nthe sixth century, B. C.\r\n\r\n“The fact that Armenia is linguistically related to the western groups\r\nof the Indo-European languages and that the Persian element consists of\r\nloan words is corroborated by geographical evidence. The Armenian\r\nhighland culminating in the 17000 foot altitude of Mt. Ararat has acted\r\nas a barrier dividing the plateau of Anatolia from that of Iran.\r\nHerodotus called the Armenians the ‘beyond’ Phrygians.” See also O.\r\nSchrader, Jevons translation, p. 430.\r\n\r\n256 : 14 _seq._ Phrygians.

C. a\r\nband of Aryan-speaking people from India, under Vijaya conquered and\r\nsettled Ceylon permanently. There are a number of later works on Ceylon,\r\ndealing with its archæology, flora, fauna, history, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to the British Indian Census of 1901 nearly two-thirds of the\r\ninhabitants of Assam were Hindus, and the language of Hinduism has\r\nbecome that of the province.

Zaborowski, 1, p. 184,\r\nsays: “The language of the Avesta, the Zend, is a contemporary dialect\r\nof the Persian of Darius (_i. e._, of Old Persian), from whence has come\r\nthe Pehlevi and its very close relative. It even presents the closest\r\naffinities with the Sanskrit of the Vedas, from which was derived, in\r\nthe time of Alexander, classical Sanskrit. This Sanskrit of the Vedas is\r\nitself so close to Old Persian that it can be said that one and the\r\nother are only two pronunciations of the same tongue.” See also the\r\nIndian Census for 1901, vol.

Strabo, 511, allies them with the\r\nScythians as one of their tribes. Many tribes were called Sacæ,\r\nespecially by the Hindus, who used the term indiscriminately to\r\ndesignate any northern invaders of India.\r\n\r\nOne tribe gained the most fertile tract in Armenia which was called\r\nSacasene, after them.\r\n\r\nZaborowski, 1, p. 94, relates the Sacæ with the Scythians, and says:\r\n“The Tadjiks are a people composed of suppressed elements where blonds\r\nare found in an important minority. These blonds, saving an atavistic\r\nsurvival of more ancient or sporadic characters I can identify. They are\r\nthe Sacæ.” He continues, in a note, that a great error has been\r\ncommitted on the subject of the Sacæ. “Repeating an assertion of Alfred\r\nMaury, whose very sound erudition enjoyed a merited reputation, I myself\r\nonce repeated that the Sacæ who figures on the rock of Behistun was of\r\nthe Kirghiz type. This assertion is completely erroneous. I have proved\r\nit and can say that the Sacæ and the Scythians were identical.”\r\n\r\nZaborowski, p. 216, also identifies the Sacæ with the Persians. On this\r\nwhole subject see Herodotus, VII, 64; also Feist, 5.\r\n\r\n259 : 21. Massagetæ. Zaborowski, 1, p. 285, says: “The first information\r\nof history concerning the peoples of Turkestan refers to the Massagetæ,\r\nwhose life was exactly the same as that of the Scythians (Herodotus, I,\r\n205–216). They enjoyed a developed industrial civilization while they\r\nremained nomads. They were doubtless composed of ethnic elements\r\ndifferent from the Scythians, but probably already spoke the Iranian\r\ntongue, like them. And since the time of Darius, at least, there were in\r\nTurkestan with them and beside them, Sacæ, whom the Greeks have always\r\nregarded as Scythians come from Europe.”\r\n\r\nMinns, _Scythians and Greeks_, p. 11, says: “The Scyths and the\r\nMassagetæ were contemporaneous and different. The Massagetæ are\r\nevidently a mixed collection of tribes without an ethnic unity; the\r\nvariety of their customs and states of culture shows this and Herodotus\r\ndoes not seem to suggest that they are all one people. They are\r\ngenerally reckoned to be Iranian.... The picture drawn of the nomad\r\nMassagetæ seems very like that of the Scythians in a rather ruder stage\r\nof development.”\r\n\r\nHerodotus, I, 215, describes them as follows: “In their dress and mode\r\nof living the Massagetæ resemble the Scythians. They fight both on\r\nhorseback and on foot, neither method is strange to them.... The\r\nfollowing are some of their customs,—each man has but one wife, yet all\r\nwives are held in common; for this is a custom of the Massagetæ and not\r\nof the Scythians, as the Greeks wrongly say. Human life does not come to\r\nits natural close with this people; but when a man grows very old, all\r\nhis kinsfolk collect together and offer him up in sacrifice; offering at\r\nthe same time some cattle also. After the sacrifice they boil the flesh\r\nand feast on it; and those who thus end their days are reckoned the\r\nhappiest. If a man dies of disease they do not eat him, but bury him in\r\nthe ground, bewailing his ill fortune that he did not come to be\r\nsacrificed. They sow no grain, but live on their herds and on fish, of\r\nwhich there is great plenty in the Araxes. Milk is what they chiefly\r\ndrink. [_Cf._ the eastern Siberian tribes of the present day.] The only\r\ngod they worship is the sun, and to him they offer the horse in\r\nsacrifice, under the notion of giving to the swiftest of the gods, the\r\nswiftest of all mortal creatures.”\r\n\r\nD’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, p. 231 declares they were the same as\r\nthe Scyths.\r\n\r\nHorse sacrifices are said to prevail among the modern Parses. On the\r\nwhole, the Massagetæ appear to have been largely Nordic.\r\n\r\n259 : 24. Kirghizes. See Zaborowski, 1, pp. 216, 290–291.\r\n\r\n259 : 25 _seq._ See the note to p. 119 : 15.\r\n\r\n260 : 3.
