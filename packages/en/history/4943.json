Among and about the headstreams and tributaries\r\nof this mighty river lie the wide and fertile provinces of the Egyptian\r\nSoudan. Situated in the very centre of the land, these remote regions\r\nare on every side divided from the seas by five hundred miles of\r\nmountain, swamp, or desert. The great river is their only means of\r\ngrowth, their only channel of progress. It is by the Nile alone that\r\ntheir commerce can reach the outer markets, or European civilisation can\r\npenetrate the inner darkness. The Soudan is joined to Egypt by the Nile,\r\nas a diver is connected with the surface by his air-pipe. Without it\r\nthere is only suffocation. Aut Nilus, aut nihil!\r\n\r\nThe town of Khartoum, at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, is\r\nthe point on which the trade of the south must inevitably converge. It\r\nis the great spout through which the merchandise collected from a wide\r\narea streams northwards to the Mediterranean shore. It marks the extreme\r\nnorthern limit of the fertile Soudan. Between Khartoum and Assuan the\r\nriver flows for twelve hundred miles through deserts of surpassing\r\ndesolation. At last the wilderness recedes and the living world broadens\r\nout again into Egypt and the Delta. It is with events that have occurred\r\nin the intervening waste that these pages are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe real Soudan, known to the statesman and the explorer, lies far\r\nto the south--moist, undulating, and exuberant. But there is another\r\nSoudan, which some mistake for the true, whose solitudes oppress the\r\nNile from the Egyptian frontier to Omdurman. This is the Soudan of the\r\nsoldier. Destitute of wealth or future, it is rich in history. The names\r\nof its squalid villages are familiar to distant and enlightened peoples.\r\nThe barrenness of its scenery has been drawn by skilful pen and pencil.\r\nIts ample deserts have tasted the blood of brave men. Its hot, black\r\nrocks have witnessed famous tragedies. It is the scene of the war.\r\n\r\nThis great tract, which may conveniently be called 'The Military\r\nSoudan,' stretches with apparent indefiniteness over the face of the\r\ncontinent. Level plains of smooth sand--a little rosier than buff, a\r\nlittle paler than salmon--are interrupted only by occasional peaks of\r\nrock--black, stark, and shapeless. Rainless storms dance tirelessly over\r\nthe hot, crisp surface of the ground. The fine sand, driven by the wind,\r\ngathers into deep drifts, and silts among the dark rocks of the hills,\r\nexactly as snow hangs about an Alpine summit; only it is a fiery snow,\r\nsuch as might fall in hell. The earth burns with the quenchless thirst\r\nof ages, and in the steel-blue sky scarcely a cloud obstructs the\r\nunrelenting triumph of the sun.\r\n\r\nThrough the desert flows the river--a thread of blue silk drawn across\r\nan enormous brown drugget; and even this thread is brown for half the\r\nyear. Where the water laps the sand and soaks into the banks there grows\r\nan avenue of vegetation which seems very beautiful and luxuriant by\r\ncontrast with what lies beyond. The Nile, through all the three thousand\r\nmiles of its course vital to everything that lives beside it, is never\r\nso precious as here. The traveller clings to the strong river as to an\r\nold friend, staunch in the hour of need. All the world blazes, but\r\nhere is shade. The deserts are hot, but the Nile is cool. The land is\r\nparched, but here is abundant water. The picture painted in burnt sienna\r\nis relieved by a grateful flash of green.\r\n\r\nYet he who had not seen the desert or felt the sun heavily on his\r\nshoulders would hardly admire the fertility of the riparian scrub.\r\nUnnourishing reeds and grasses grow rank and coarse from the water's\r\nedge. The dark, rotten soil between the tussocks is cracked and\r\ngranulated by the drying up of the annual flood. The character of the\r\nvegetation is inhospitable. Thorn-bushes, bristling like hedgehogs\r\nand thriving arrogantly, everywhere predominate and with their prickly\r\ntangles obstruct or forbid the path. Only the palms by the brink are\r\nkindly, and men journeying along the Nile must look often towards their\r\nbushy tops, where among the spreading foliage the red and yellow glint\r\nof date clusters proclaims the ripening of a generous crop, and protests\r\nthat Nature is not always mischievous and cruel.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Nile, except by contrast with the desert, display\r\nan abundance of barrenness. Their characteristic is monotony. Their\r\nattraction is their sadness. Yet there is one hour when all is changed.\r\nJust before the sun sets towards the western cliffs a delicious flush\r\nbrightens and enlivens the landscape. It is as though some Titanic\r\nartist in an hour of inspiration were retouching the picture, painting\r\nin dark purple shadows among the rocks, strengthening the lights on the\r\nsands, gilding and beautifying everything, and making the whole scene\r\nlive. The river, whose windings make it look like a lake, turns from\r\nmuddy brown to silver-grey. The sky from a dull blue deepens into violet\r\nin the west. Everything under that magic touch becomes vivid and alive.\r\nAnd then the sun sinks altogether behind the rocks, the colors fade out\r\nof the sky, the flush off the sands, and gradually everything darkens\r\nand grows grey--like a man's cheek when he is bleeding to death. We are\r\nleft sad and sorrowful in the dark, until the stars light up and remind\r\nus that there is always something beyond.\r\n\r\nIn a land whose beauty is the beauty of a moment, whose face is\r\ndesolate, and whose character is strangely stern, the curse of war\r\nwas hardly needed to produce a melancholy effect. Why should there be\r\ncaustic plants where everything is hot and burning? In deserts where\r\nthirst is enthroned, and where the rocks and sand appeal to a pitiless\r\nsky for moisture, it was a savage trick to add the mockery of mirage.\r\n\r\nThe area multiplies the desolation. There is life only by the Nile. If a\r\nman were to leave the river, he might journey westward and find no human\r\nhabitation, nor the smoke of a cooking fire, except the lonely tent of a\r\nKabbabish Arab or the encampment of a trader's caravan, till he reached\r\nthe coast-line of America. Or he might go east and find nothing but sand\r\nand sea and sun until Bombay rose above the horizon. The thread of\r\nfresh water is itself solitary in regions where all living things lack\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn the account of the River War the Nile is naturally supreme. It is\r\nthe great melody that recurs throughout the whole opera. The general\r\npurposing military operations, the statesman who would decide upon grave\r\npolicies, and the reader desirous of studying the course and results\r\nof either, must think of the Nile. It is the life of the lands through\r\nwhich it flows. It is the cause of the war: the means by which we fight;\r\nthe end at which we aim. Imagination should paint the river through\r\nevery page in the story. It glitters between the palm-trees during the\r\nactions. It is the explanation of nearly every military movement. By\r\nits banks the armies camp at night. Backed or flanked on its unfordable\r\nstream they offer or accept battle by day. To its brink, morning and\r\nevening, long lines of camels, horses, mules, and slaughter cattle hurry\r\neagerly. Emir and Dervish, officer and soldier, friend and foe, kneel\r\nalike to this god of ancient Egypt and draw each day their daily water\r\nin goatskin or canteen. Without the river none would have started.\r\nWithout it none might have continued. Without it none could ever have\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nAll who journey on the Nile, whether in commerce or war, will pay their\r\ntribute of respect and gratitude; for the great river has befriended\r\nall races and every age. Through all the centuries it has performed\r\nthe annual miracle of its flood. Every year when the rains fall and the\r\nmountain snows of Central Africa begin to melt, the head-streams become\r\ntorrents and the great lakes are filled to the brim. A vast expanse of\r\nlow, swampy lands, crossed by secondary channels and flooded for many\r\nmiles, regulates the flow, and by a sponge-like action prevents the\r\nexcess of one year from causing the deficiency of the next. Far away\r\nin Egypt, prince, priest, and peasant look southwards with anxious\r\nattention for the fluctuating yet certain rise. Gradually the flood\r\nbegins. The Bahr-el-Ghazal from a channel of stagnant pools and marshes\r\nbecomes a broad and navigable stream. The Sobat and the Atbara from dry\r\nwatercourses with occasional pools, in which the fish and crocodiles\r\nare crowded, turn to rushing rivers. But all this is remote from Egypt.\r\nAfter its confluence with the Atbara no drop of water reaches the Nile,\r\nand it flows for seven hundred miles through the sands or rushes in\r\ncataracts among the rocks of the Nubian desert. Nevertheless, in spite\r\nof the tremendous diminution in volume caused by the dryness of the\r\nearth and air and the heat of the sun--all of which drink greedily--the\r\nriver below Assuan is sufficiently great to supply nine millions of\r\npeople with as much water as their utmost science and energies can draw,\r\nand yet to pour into the Mediterranean a low-water surplus current of\r\n61,500 cubic feet per second. Nor is its water its only gift. As the\r\nNile rises its complexion is changed. The clear blue river becomes thick\r\nand red, laden with the magic mud that can raise cities from the desert\r\nsand and make the wilderness a garden. The geographer may still in\r\nthe arrogance of science describe the Nile as 'a great, steady-flowing\r\nriver, fed by the rains of the tropics, controlled by the existence of a\r\nvast head reservoir and several areas of repose, and annually flooded\r\nby the accession of a great body of water with which its eastern\r\ntributaries are flushed' [ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA]; but all who have\r\ndrunk deeply of its soft yet fateful waters--fateful, since they give\r\nboth life and death--will understand why the old Egyptians worshipped\r\nthe river, nor will they even in modern days easily dissociate from\r\ntheir minds a feeling of mystic reverence.\r\n\r\nSouth of Khartoum and of 'The Military Soudan' the land becomes more\r\nfruitful. The tributaries of the Nile multiply the areas of riparian\r\nfertility. A considerable rainfall, increasing as the Equator is\r\napproached, enables the intervening spaces to support vegetation and\r\nconsequently human life. The greater part of the country is feverish and\r\nunhealthy, nor can Europeans long sustain the attacks of its climate.\r\nNevertheless it is by no means valueless. On the east the province of\r\nSennar used to produce abundant grain, and might easily produce no less\r\nabundant cotton. Westward the vast territories of Kordofan and Darfur\r\nafford grazing-grounds to a multitude of cattle, and give means of\r\nlivelihood to great numbers of Baggara or cow-herd Arabs, who may also\r\npursue with activity and stratagem the fleet giraffe and the still\r\nfleeter ostrich. To the south-east lies Bahr-el-Ghazal, a great tract of\r\ncountry occupied by dense woods and plentifully watered. Further south\r\nand nearer the Equator the forests and marshes become exuberant with\r\ntropical growths, and the whole face of the land is moist and green.\r\nAmid groves of gigantic trees and through plains of high waving grass\r\nthe stately elephant roams in herds which occasionally number four\r\nhundred, hardly ever disturbed by a well-armed hunter. The ivory of\r\ntheir tusks constitutes the wealth of the Equatorial Province. So\r\ngreatly they abound that Emin Pasha is provoked to complain of a pest of\r\nthese valuable pachyderms [LIFE OF EMIN PASHA, vol.i chapter ix.]: and\r\nalthough they are only assailed by the natives with spear and gun, no\r\nless than twelve thousand hundredweight of ivory has been exported in a\r\nsingle year [Ibid.] All other kinds of large beasts known to man inhabit\r\nthese obscure retreats. The fierce rhinoceros crashes through the\r\nundergrowth. Among the reeds of melancholy swamps huge hippopotami,\r\ncrocodiles, and buffaloes prosper and increase. Antelope of every known\r\nand many unclassified species; serpents of peculiar venom; countless\r\nmillions of birds, butterflies, and beetles are among the offspring\r\nof prolific Nature. And the daring sportsman who should survive his\r\nexpedition would not fail to add to the achievements of science and the\r\nextent of natural history as well as to his own reputation.\r\n\r\nThe human inhabitants of the Soudan would not, but for their vices and\r\nmisfortunes, be disproportioned in numbers to the fauna or less happy.\r\nWar, slavery, and oppression have, however, afflicted them until the\r\ntotal population of the whole country does not exceed at the most\r\nliberal estimate three million souls. The huge area contains many\r\ndifferences of climate and conditions, and these have produced peculiar\r\nand diverse breeds of men. The Soudanese are of many tribes, but two\r\nmain races can be clearly distinguished: the aboriginal natives, and the\r\nArab settlers. The indigenous inhabitants of the country were negroes as\r\nblack as coal. Strong, virile, and simple-minded savages, they lived as\r\nwe may imagine prehistoric men--hunting, fighting, marrying, and dying,\r\nwith no ideas beyond the gratification of their physical desires, and\r\nno fears save those engendered by ghosts, witchcraft, the worship of\r\nancestors, and other forms of superstition common among peoples of low\r\ndevelopment. They displayed the virtues of barbarism. They were brave\r\nand honest. The smallness of their intelligence excused the degradation\r\nof their habits. Their ignorance secured their innocence. Yet their\r\neulogy must be short, for though their customs, language, and appearance\r\nvary with the districts they inhabit and the subdivisions to which they\r\nbelong, the history of all is a confused legend of strife and misery,\r\ntheir natures are uniformly cruel and thriftless, and their condition is\r\none of equal squalor and want.\r\n\r\nAlthough the negroes are the more numerous, the Arabs exceed in power.\r\nThe bravery of the aboriginals is outweighed by the intelligence of\r\nthe invaders and their superior force of character. During the second\r\ncentury of the Mohammedan era, when the inhabitants of Arabia went\r\nforth to conquer the world, one adventurous army struck south. The first\r\npioneers were followed at intervals by continual immigrations of Arabs\r\nnot only from Arabia but also across the deserts from Egypt and Marocco.\r\nThe element thus introduced has spread and is spreading throughout the\r\nSoudan, as water soaks into a dry sponge. The aboriginals absorbed the\r\ninvaders they could not repel. The stronger race imposed its customs and\r\nlanguage on the negroes. The vigour of their blood sensibly altered the\r\nfacial appearance of the Soudanese. For more than a thousand years\r\nthe influence of Mohammedanism, which appears to possess a strange\r\nfascination for negroid races, has been permeating the Soudan, and,\r\nalthough ignorance and natural obstacles impede the progress of new\r\nideas, the whole of the black race is gradually adopting the new\r\nreligion and developing Arab characteristics. In the districts of the\r\nnorth, where the original invaders settled, the evolution is complete,\r\nand the Arabs of the Soudan are a race formed by the interbreeding\r\nof negro and Arab, and yet distinct from both. In the more remote and\r\ninaccessible regions which lie to the south and west the negro race\r\nremains as yet unchanged by the Arab influence. And between these\r\nextremes every degree of mixture is to be found. In some tribes pure\r\nArabic is spoken, and prior to the rise of the Mahdi the orthodox Moslem\r\nfaith was practised. In others Arabic has merely modified the ancient\r\ndialects, and the Mohammedan religion has been adapted to the older\r\nsuperstitions; but although the gap between the Arab-negro and the\r\nnegro-pure is thus filled by every intermediate blend, the two races\r\nwere at an early date quite distinct.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of mongrels are rarely admirable, and the mixture of\r\nthe Arab and negro types has produced a debased and cruel breed, more\r\nshocking because they are more intelligent than the primitive savages.\r\nThe stronger race soon began to prey upon the simple aboriginals; some\r\nof the Arab tribes were camel-breeders; some were goat-herds; some were\r\nBaggaras or cow-herds. But all, without exception, were hunters of men.\r\nTo the great slave-market at Jedda a continual stream of negro captives\r\nhas flowed for hundreds of years. The invention of gunpowder and the\r\nadoption by the Arabs of firearms facilitated the traffic by placing the\r\nignorant negroes at a further disadvantage. Thus the situation in the\r\nSoudan for several centuries may be summed up as follows: The dominant\r\nrace of Arab invaders was unceasingly spreading its blood, religion,\r\ncustoms, and language among the black aboriginal population, and at the\r\nsame time it harried and enslaved them.\r\n\r\nThe state of society that arose out of this may be easily imagined. The\r\nwarlike Arab tribes fought and brawled among themselves in ceaseless\r\nfeud and strife. The negroes trembled in apprehension of capture, or\r\nrose locally against their oppressors. Occasionally an important Sheikh\r\nwould effect the combination of many tribes, and a kingdom came into\r\nexistence--a community consisting of a military class armed with\r\nguns and of multitudes of slaves, at once their servants and their\r\nmerchandise, and sometimes trained as soldiers. The dominion might\r\nprosper viciously till it was overthrown by some more powerful league.\r\n\r\nAll this was unheeded by the outer world, from which the Soudan is\r\nseparated by the deserts, and it seemed that the slow, painful course\r\nof development would be unaided and uninterrupted. But at last the\r\npopulations of Europe changed. Another civilisation reared itself above\r\nthe ruins of Roman triumph and Mohammedan aspiration--a civilisation\r\nmore powerful, more glorious, but no less aggressive. The impulse of\r\nconquest which hurried the French and English to Canada and the Indies,\r\nwhich sent the Dutch to the Cape and the Spaniards to Peru, spread to\r\nAfrica and led the Egyptians to the Soudan. In the year 1819 Mohammed\r\nAli, availing himself of the disorders alike as an excuse and an\r\nopportunity, sent his son Ismail up the Nile with a great army. The Arab\r\ntribes, torn by dissension, exhausted by thirty years of general war,\r\nand no longer inspired by their neglected religion, offered a weak\r\nresistance. Their slaves, having known the worst of life, were\r\napathetic. The black aboriginals were silent and afraid. The whole vast\r\nterritory was conquered with very little fighting, and the victorious\r\narmy, leaving garrisons, returned in triumph to the Delta.\r\n\r\nWhat enterprise that an enlightened community may attempt is more noble\r\nand more profitable than the reclamation from barbarism of fertile\r\nregions and large populations? To give peace to warring tribes, to\r\nadminister justice where all was violence, to strike the chains off the\r\nslave, to draw the richness from the soil, to plant the earliest seeds\r\nof commerce and learning, to increase in whole peoples their capacities\r\nfor pleasure and diminish their chances of pain--what more beautiful\r\nideal or more valuable reward can inspire human effort? The act is\r\nvirtuous, the exercise invigorating, and the result often extremely\r\nprofitable. Yet as the mind turns from the wonderful cloudland of\r\naspiration to the ugly scaffolding of attempt and achievement, a\r\nsuccession of opposite ideas arises. Industrious races are displayed\r\nstinted and starved for the sake of an expensive Imperialism which they\r\ncan only enjoy if they are well fed. Wild peoples, ignorant of their\r\nbarbarism, callous of suffering, careless of life but tenacious of\r\nliberty, are seen to resist with fury the philanthropic invaders, and\r\nto perish in thousands before they are convinced of their mistake. The\r\ninevitable gap between conquest and dominion becomes filled with the\r\nfigures of the greedy trader, the inopportune missionary, the ambitious\r\nsoldier, and the lying speculator, who disquiet the minds of the\r\nconquered and excite the sordid appetites of the conquerors. And as\r\nthe eye of thought rests on these sinister features, it hardly seems\r\npossible for us to believe that any fair prospect is approached by so\r\nfoul a path.\r\n\r\nFrom 1819 to 1883 Egypt ruled the Soudan. Her rule was not kindly,\r\nwise, or profitable. Its aim was to exploit, not to improve the local\r\npopulation. The miseries of the people were aggravated rather than\r\nlessened: but they were concealed. For the rough injustice of the\r\nsword there were substituted the intricacies of corruption and bribery.\r\nViolence and plunder were more hideous, since they were cloaked with\r\nlegality and armed with authority. The land was undeveloped and poor.\r\nIt barely sustained its inhabitants. The additional burden of a\r\nconsiderable foreign garrison and a crowd of rapacious officials\r\nincreased the severity of the economic conditions. Scarcity\r\nwas frequent. Famines were periodical. Corrupt and incapable\r\nGovernors-General succeeded each other at Khartoum with bewildering\r\nrapidity. The constant changes, while they prevented the continuity\r\nof any wise policy, did not interrupt the misrule. With hardly any\r\nexceptions, the Pashas were consistent in oppression. The success of\r\ntheir administration was measured by the Ministries in Egypt by the\r\namount of money they could extort from the natives; among the officials\r\nin the Soudan, by the number of useless offices they could create. There\r\nwere a few bright examples of honest men, but these, by providing a\r\ncontrast, only increased the discontents.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Egypt was iniquitous: yet it preserved the magnificent\r\nappearance of Imperial dominion. The Egyptian Pro-consul lived in state\r\nat the confluence of the Niles. The representatives of foreign Powers\r\nestablished themselves in the city. The trade of the south converged\r\nupon Khartoum. Thither the subordinate governors, Beys and Mudirs,\r\nrepaired at intervals to report the state of their provinces and to\r\nreceive instructions. Thither were sent the ivory of Equatoria, the\r\nostrich feathers of Kordofan, gum from Darfur, grain from Sennar, and\r\ntaxes collected from all the regions. Strange beasts, entrapped in the\r\nswamps and forests, passed through the capital on their journey to Cairo\r\nand Europe. Complex and imposing reports of revenue and expenditure\r\nwere annually compiled. An elaborate and dignified correspondence was\r\nmaintained between Egypt and its great dependency. The casual observer,\r\nastonished at the unusual capacity for government displayed by an\r\nOriental people, was tempted to accept the famous assertion which Nubar\r\nPasha put into the mouth of the Khedive Ismail: 'We are no longer in\r\nAfrica, but in Europe.' Yet all was a hateful sham ['The government\r\nof the Egyptians in these far-off countries is nothing else but one of\r\nbrigandage of the very worst description.'--COLONEL GORDON IN CENTRAL\r\nAFRICA, April 11, 1879.] The arbitrary and excessive taxes were\r\ncollected only at the point of the bayonet. If a petty chief fell into\r\narrears, his neighbours were raised against him. If an Arab tribe\r\nwere recalcitrant, a military expedition was despatched. Moreover, the\r\nability of the Arabs to pay depended on their success as slave-hunters.\r\nWhen there had been a good catch, the revenue profited. The Egyptian\r\nGovernment had joined the International League against the slave trade.\r\nThey combined, however, indirectly but deliberately, to make money out\r\nof it. [EGYPT, No.11, 1883.]\r\n\r\nIn the miserable, harassing warfare that accompanied the collection of\r\ntaxes the Viceregal commanders gained more from fraud than force. No\r\nsubterfuge, no treachery, was too mean for them to adopt: no oath or\r\ntreaty was too sacred for them to break. Their methods were cruel, and\r\nif honour did not impede the achievement, mercy did not restrict the\r\neffects of their inglorious successes; and the effete administrators\r\ndelighted to order their timid soldiery to carry out the most\r\nsavage executions. The political methods and social style of the\r\nGovernors-General were imitated more or less exactly by the subordinate\r\nofficials according to their degree in the provinces. Since they were\r\ncompletely hidden from the eye of civilisation, they enjoyed a greater\r\nlicence in their administration. As their education was inferior, so\r\ntheir habits became more gross. Meanwhile the volcano on which they\r\ndisported themselves was ominously silent. The Arab tribes obeyed, and\r\nthe black population cowered.\r\n\r\nThe authority of a tyrannical Government was supported by the presence\r\nof a worthless army. Nearly forty thousand men were distributed among\r\neight main and numerous minor garrisons. Isolated in a roadless country\r\nby enormous distances and natural obstacles, and living in the midst\r\nof large savage populations of fanatical character and warlike habits,\r\nwhose exasperation was yearly growing with their miseries, the Viceregal\r\nforces might depend for their safety only on the skill of their\r\nofficers, the excellence of their discipline, and the superiority of\r\ntheir weapons. But the Egyptian officers were at that time distinguished\r\nfor nothing but their public incapacity and private misbehaviour. The\r\nevil reputation of the Soudan and its climate deterred the more educated\r\nor more wealthy from serving in such distant regions, and none went\r\nsouth who could avoid it. The army which the Khedives maintained in the\r\nDelta was, judged by European standards, only a rabble. It was badly\r\ntrained, rarely paid, and very cowardly; and the scum of the army of the\r\nDelta was the cream of the army of the Soudan. The officers remained\r\nfor long periods, many all their lives, in the obscurity of the remote\r\nprovinces. Some had been sent there in disgrace, others in disfavour.\r\nSome had been forced to serve out of Egypt by extreme poverty, others\r\nwere drawn to the Soudan by the hopes of gratifying peculiar tastes. The\r\nmajority had harems of the women of the country, which were limited only\r\nby the amount of money they could lay their hands on by any method. Many\r\nwere hopeless and habitual drunkards. Nearly all were dishonest. All\r\nwere indolent and incapable.\r\n\r\nUnder such leadership the finest soldiery would have soon degenerated.\r\nThe Egyptians in the Soudan were not fine soldiers. Like their officers,\r\nthey were the worst part of the Khedivial army. Like them, they had been\r\ndriven to the south. Like them, they were slothful and effete. Their\r\ntraining was imperfect; their discipline was lax; their courage was\r\nlow. Nor was even this all the weakness and peril of their position; for\r\nwhile the regular troops were thus demoralised, there existed a powerful\r\nlocal irregular force of Bazingers (Soudanese riflemen), as well armed\r\nas the soldiers, more numerous, more courageous, and who regarded the\r\nalien garrisons with fear that continually diminished and hate that\r\ncontinually grew. And behind regulars and irregulars alike the wild\r\nArab tribes of the desert and the hardy blacks of the forests, goaded by\r\nsuffering and injustice, thought the foreigners the cause of all their\r\nwoes, and were delayed only by their inability to combine from sweeping\r\nthem off the face of the earth. Never was there such a house of cards\r\nas the Egyptian dominion in the Soudan. The marvel is that it stood so\r\nlong, not that it fell so soon.\r\n\r\nThe names of two men of character and fame are forever connected with\r\nthe actual outburst. One was an English general, the other an Arab\r\npriest; yet, in spite of the great gulf and vivid contrast between\r\ntheir conditions, they resembled each other in many respects. Both were\r\nearnest and enthusiastic men of keen sympathies and passionate emotions.\r\nBoth were powerfully swayed by religious fervour. Both exerted great\r\npersonal influence on all who came in contact with them. Both were\r\nreformers. The Arab was an African reproduction of the Englishman; the\r\nEnglishman a superior and civilised development of the Arab. In the end\r\nthey fought to the death, but for an important part of their lives\r\ntheir influence on the fortunes of the Soudan was exerted in the same\r\ndirection. Mohammed Ahmed, 'The Mahdi,' will be discussed in his own\r\nplace. Charles Gordon needs little introduction. Long before this tale\r\nbegins his reputation was European, and the fame of the 'Ever-victorious\r\nArmy' had spread far beyond the Great Wall of China.\r\n\r\nThe misgovernment of the Egyptians and the misery of the Soudanese\r\nreached their greatest extreme in the seventh decade of the present\r\ncentury. From such a situation there seemed to be no issue other than\r\nby force of arms. The Arab tribes lacked no provocation. Yet they were\r\ndestitute of two moral forces essential to all rebellions. The first\r\nwas the knowledge that better things existed. The second was a spirit\r\nof combination. General Gordon showed them the first. The Mahdi provided\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to study any part of Charles Gordon's career without\r\nbeing drawn to all the rest. As his wild and varied fortunes lead him\r\nfrom Sebastopol to Pekin, from Gravesend to South Africa, from Mauritius\r\nto the Soudan, the reader follows fascinated. Every scene is strange,\r\nterrible, or dramatic. Yet, remarkable as are the scenes, the actor is\r\nthe more extraordinary; a type without comparison in modern times\r\nand with few likenesses in history. Rare and precious is the truly\r\ndisinterested man. Potentates of many lands and different degree--the\r\nEmperor of China, the King of the Belgians, the Premier of Cape Colony,\r\nthe Khedive of Egypt--competed to secure his services. The importance of\r\nhis offices varied no less than their nature. One day he was a subaltern\r\nof sappers; on another he commanded the Chinese army; the next he\r\ndirected an orphanage; or was Governor-General of the Soudan, with\r\nsupreme powers of life and death and peace and war; or served as private\r\nsecretary to Lord Ripon. But in whatever capacity he laboured he was\r\ntrue to his reputation. Whether he is portrayed bitterly criticising to\r\nGraham the tactics of the assault on the Redan; or pulling the head\r\nof Lar Wang from under his bedstead and waving it in paroxysms of\r\nindignation before the astonished eyes of Sir Halliday Macartney;\r\nor riding alone into the camp of the rebel Suliman and receiving the\r\nrespectful salutes of those who had meant to kill him; or telling\r\nthe Khedive Ismail that he 'must have the whole Soudan to govern'; or\r\nreducing his salary to half the regulation amount because 'he thought\r\nit was too much'; or ruling a country as large as Europe; or collecting\r\nfacts for Lord Ripon's rhetorical efforts--we perceive a man careless\r\nalike of the frowns of men or the smiles of women, of life or comfort,\r\nwealth or fame.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity that one, thus gloriously free from the ordinary\r\nrestraining influences of human society, should have found in his\r\nown character so little mental ballast. His moods were capricious and\r\nuncertain, his passions violent, his impulses sudden and inconsistent.\r\nThe mortal enemy of the morning had become a trusted ally before the\r\nnight. The friend he loved to-day he loathed to-morrow. Scheme after\r\nscheme formed in his fertile brain, and jostled confusingly together.\r\nAll in succession were pressed with enthusiasm. All at times were\r\nrejected with disdain. A temperament naturally neurotic had been\r\naggravated by an acquired habit of smoking; and the General carried this\r\nto so great an extreme that he was rarely seen without a cigarette. His\r\nvirtues are famous among men; his daring and resource might turn\r\nthe tide or war; his energy would have animated a whole people; his\r\nachievements are upon record; but it must also be set down that few more\r\nuncertain and impracticable forces than Gordon have ever been introduced\r\ninto administration and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Egyptian Government might loudly proclaim their detestation\r\nof slavery, their behaviour in the Soudan was viewed with suspicion by\r\nthe European Powers, and particularly by Great Britain. To vindicate his\r\nsincerity the Khedive Ismail in 1874 appointed Gordon to be Governor of\r\nthe Equatorial Province in succession to Sir Samuel Baker. The name of\r\nthe General was a sufficient guarantee that the slave trade was being\r\nearnestly attacked. The Khedive would gladly have stopped at the\r\nguarantee, and satisfied the world without disturbing 'vested\r\ninterests.' But the mission, which may have been originally instituted\r\nas a pretence, soon became in Gordon's energetic hands very real.\r\nCircumstances, moreover, soon enlisted the sympathies of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment on the side of their zealous agent. The slave dealers had\r\ncommitted every variety of atrocity for which the most odious traffic\r\nin the world afforded occasion; but when, under the leadership of Zubehr\r\nRahamna, they refused to pay their annual tribute, it was felt in Cairo\r\nthat their crimes had cried aloud for chastisement.\r\n\r\nZubehr is sufficiently described when it has been said that he was the\r\nmost notorious slave dealer Africa has ever produced. His infamy had\r\nspread beyond the limits of the continent which was the scene of his\r\nexploits to the distant nations of the north and west. In reality, his\r\nrule was a distinct advance on the anarchy which had preceded it, and\r\ncertainly he was no worse than others of his vile trade. His scale\r\nof business was, however, more extended. What William Whiteley was in\r\nrespect of goods and chattels, that was Zubehr in respect of slaves--a\r\nuniversal provider. Magnitude lends a certain grandeur to crime; and\r\nZubehr in the height of his power, at the head of the slave merchants'\r\nconfederacy, might boast the retinue of a king and exercise authority\r\nover wide regions and a powerful army.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1869 he was practically the independent ruler of the\r\nBahr-el-Ghazal. The Khedive resolved to assert his rights. A small\r\nEgyptian force was sent to subdue the rebel slaver who not only\r\ndisgraced humanity but refused to pay tribute. Like most of the\r\nKhedivial expeditions the troops under Bellal Bey met with ill-fortune.\r\nThey came, they saw, they ran away. Some, less speedy than the rest,\r\nfell on the field of dishonour. The rebellion was open. Nevertheless it\r\nwas the Khedive who sought peace. Zubehr apologised for defeating the\r\nViceregal soldiers and remained supreme in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. Thence he\r\nplanned the conquest of Darfur, at that time an independent kingdom. The\r\nEgyptian Government were glad to join with him in the enterprise. The\r\nman they had been unable to conquer, they found it expedient to\r\nassist. The operations were successful. The King of Darfur, who was\r\ndistinguished no less for his valour than for his folly, was killed.\r\nThe whole country was subdued. The whole population available after\r\nthe battles became slaves. Zubehr thus wielded a formidable power. The\r\nKhedivial Government, thinking to ensure his loyalty, created him a\r\nPasha--a rank which he could scarcely disgrace; and the authority of\r\nthe rebel was thus unwillingly recognised by the ruler. Such was the\r\nsituation when Gordon first came to the Soudan.\r\n\r\nIt was beyond the power of the new Governor of the Equatorial Province\r\nat once to destroy the slave-hunting confederacy. Yet he struck heavy\r\nblows at the slave trade, and when in 1877, after a short visit to\r\nEngland, he returned to the Soudan as Governor-General and with absolute\r\npower, he assailed it with redoubled energy. Fortune assisted his\r\nefforts, for the able Zubehr was enticed to Cairo, and, once there, the\r\nGovernment refused to allow their faithful ally and distinguished guest\r\nto go back to his happy-hunting grounds. Although the slave dealers were\r\nthus robbed of their great leader, they were still strong, and Zubehr's\r\nson, the brave Suliman, found a considerable following. Furious at his\r\nfather's captivity, and alarmed lest his own should follow, he meditated\r\nrevolt. But the Governor-General, mounted on a swift camel and attired\r\nin full uniform, rode alone into the rebel camp and compelled the\r\nsubmission of its chiefs before they could recover from their amazement.\r\nThe confederacy was severely shaken, and when, in the following year,\r\nSuliman again revolted, the Egyptian troops under Gessi Pasha were able\r\nto disperse his forces and induce him to surrender on terms. The terms\r\nwere broken, and Suliman and ten of his companions suffered death by\r\nshooting [von Slatin, Baron Rudolf Karl. FIRE AND SWORD IN THE SOUDAN,\r\np.28.] The league of the slave dealers was thus destroyed.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1879 Gordon left the Soudan. With short intervals he\r\nhad spent five busy years in its provinces. His energy had stirred the\r\ncountry. He had struck at the root of the slave trade, he had attacked\r\nthe system of slavery, and, as slavery was the greatest institution in\r\nthe land, he had undermined the whole social system. Indignation had\r\nstimulated his activity to an extraordinary degree. In a climate usually\r\nfatal to Europeans he discharged the work of five officers. Careless\r\nof his methods, he bought slaves himself, drilled them, and with the\r\nsoldiers thus formed pounced on the caravans of the hunters. Traversing\r\nthe country on a fleet dromedary--on which in a single year he is said\r\nto have covered 3,840 miles--he scattered justice and freedom among the\r\nastonished natives. He fed the infirm, protected the weak, executed the\r\nwicked. To some he gave actual help, to many freedom, to all new hopes\r\nand aspirations. Nor were the tribes ungrateful. The fiercest savages\r\nand cannibals respected the life of the strange white man. The women\r\nblessed him. He could ride unarmed and alone where a brigade of soldiers\r\ndared not venture. But he was, as he knew himself, the herald of the\r\nstorm. Oppressed yet ferocious races had learned that they had rights;\r\nthe misery of the Soudanese was lessened, but their knowledge had\r\nincreased. The whole population was unsettled, and the wheels of change\r\nbegan slowly to revolve; nor did they stop until they had accomplished\r\nan enormous revolution.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the second force is more obscure. Few facts are so\r\nencouraging to the student of human development as the desire, which\r\nmost men and all communities manifest at all times, to associate with\r\ntheir actions at least the appearance of moral right. However distorted\r\nmay be their conceptions of virtue, however feeble their efforts to\r\nattain even to their own ideals, it is a pleasing feature and a hopeful\r\naugury that they should wish to be justified. No community embarks on\r\na great enterprise without fortifying itself with the belief that from\r\nsome points of view its motives are lofty and disinterested. It is an\r\ninvoluntary tribute, the humble tribute of imperfect beings, to the\r\neternal temples of Truth and Beauty. The sufferings of a people or a\r\nclass may be intolerable, but before they will take up arms and risk\r\ntheir lives some unselfish and impersonal spirit must animate them. In\r\ncountries where there is education and mental activity or refinement,\r\nthis high motive is found in the pride of glorious traditions or in a\r\nkeen sympathy with surrounding misery. Ignorance deprives savage nations\r\nof such incentives. Yet in the marvellous economy of nature this very\r\nignorance is a source of greater strength. It affords them the mighty\r\nstimulus of fanaticism. The French Communists might plead that they\r\nupheld the rights of man. The desert tribes proclaimed that they fought\r\nfor the glory of God. But although the force of fanatical passion is far\r\ngreater than that exerted by any philosophical belief, its sanction is\r\njust the same. It gives men something which they think is sublime\r\nto fight for, and this serves them as an excuse for wars which it is\r\ndesirable to begin for totally different reasons. Fanaticism is not a\r\ncause of war. It is the means which helps savage peoples to fight. It is\r\nthe spirit which enables them to combine--the great common object before\r\nwhich all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant. What the\r\nhorn is to the rhinoceros, what the sting is to the wasp, the Mohammedan\r\nfaith was to the Arabs of the Soudan--a faculty of offence or defence.\r\n\r\nIt was all this and no more. It was not the reason of the revolt. It\r\nstrengthened, it characterised, but it did not cause. ['I do not believe\r\nthat fanaticism exists as it used to do in the world, judging from what\r\nI have seen in this so-called fanatic land. It is far more a question\r\nof property, and is more like Communism under the flag of\r\nreligion.'--GENERAL GORDON'S JOURNALS AT KHARTOUM, bk.i. p.13.] Those\r\nwhose practice it is to regard their own nation as possessing a\r\nmonopoly of virtue and common-sense, are wont to ascribe every military\r\nenterprise of savage peoples to fanaticism. They calmly ignore obvious\r\nand legitimate motives. The most rational conduct is considered mad. It\r\nhas therefore been freely stated, and is to some extent believed, that\r\nthe revolt in the Soudan was entirely religious. If the worst untruths\r\nare those that have some appearance of veracity, this impression must be\r\nvery false indeed. It is, perhaps, an historical fact that the revolt\r\nof a large population has never been caused solely or even mainly by\r\nreligious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which forced the peoples of the Soudan to revolt were as\r\nstrong as the defence which their oppressors could offer was feeble.\r\nLooking at the question from a purely political standpoint, we may\r\nsay that upon the whole there exists no record of a better case for\r\nrebellion than presented itself to the Soudanese. Their country was\r\nbeing ruined; their property was plundered; their women were ravished;\r\ntheir liberties were curtailed; even their lives were threatened.\r\nAliens ruled the inhabitants; the few oppressed the many; brave men were\r\nharried by cowards; the weak compelled the strong. Here were sufficient\r\nreasons. Since any armed movement against an established Government can\r\nbe justified only by success, strength is an important revolutionary\r\nvirtue. It was a virtue that the Arabs might boast. They were indeed\r\nfar stronger than they, their persecutors, or the outside world had yet\r\nlearned. All were soon to be enlightened.\r\n\r\nThe storm gathered and the waters rose. Three great waves impelled the\r\nliving tide against the tottering house founded on the desert sand.\r\nThe Arab suffered acutely from poverty, misgovernment, and oppression.\r\nInfuriated, he looked up and perceived that the cause of all his\r\nmiseries was a weak and cowardly foreigner, a despicable 'Turk.' The\r\nantagonism of races increased the hatred sprung from social evils. The\r\nmoment was at hand. Then, and not till then, the third wave came--the\r\nwave of fanaticism, which, catching up and surmounting the other waves,\r\ncovered all the flood with its white foam, and, bearing on with the\r\nmomentum of the waters, beat in thunder against the weak house so that\r\nit fell; and great was the fall thereof.\r\n\r\nDown to the year 1881 there was no fanatical movement in the Soudan.\r\nIn their utter misery the hopeless inhabitants had neglected even\r\nthe practices of religion. They were nevertheless prepared for any\r\nenterprise, however desperate, which might free them from the Egyptian\r\nyoke. All that delayed them was the want of some leader who could\r\ncombine the tribes and restore their broken spirits, and in the summer\r\nof 1881 the leader appeared. His subsequent career is within the\r\nlimits of this account, and since his life throws a strong light on the\r\nthoughts and habits of the Arabs of the Soudan it may be worth while to\r\ntrace it from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe man who was the proximate cause of the River War was born by the\r\nbanks of the Nile, not very far from Dongola. His family were poor and\r\nof no account in the province. But as the Prophet had claimed a royal\r\ndescent, and as a Sacred Example was sprung from David's line, Mohammed\r\nAhmed asserted that he was of the 'Ashraf,'(descendants of the Prophet)\r\nand the assertion, since it cannot be disproved, may be accepted.\r\nHis father was a humble priest; yet he contrived to give his son some\r\neducation in the practices of religion, the principles of the Koran,\r\nand the art of writing. Then he died at Kerreri while on a journey to\r\nKhartoum, and left the future Mahdi, still a child, to the mercies of\r\nthe world. Solitary trees, if they grow at all, grow strong; and a boy\r\ndeprived of a father's care often develops, if he escape the perils of\r\nyouth, an independence and vigour of thought which may restore in after\r\nlife the heavy loss of early days. It was so with Mohammed Ahmed. He\r\nlooked around for an occupation and subsistence. A large proportion\r\nof the population of religious countries pass their lives at leisure,\r\nsupported by the patient labour of the devout. The young man determined\r\nto follow the profession for which he felt his talents suited, and\r\nwhich would afford him the widest scope. He became a priest. Many of\r\nthe religious teachers of heathen and other countries are devoid of\r\nenthusiasm and turn their attention to the next world because doing so\r\naffords them an easy living in this. Happily this is not true of all. It\r\nwas not true of Mohammed. Even at an early age he manifested a zeal for\r\nGod's service, and displayed a peculiar aptitude for learning the tenets\r\nand dogmas of the Mohammedan belief. So promising a pupil did not\r\nlong lack a master in a country where intelligence and enthusiasm\r\nwere scarce. His aspirations growing with his years and knowledge, he\r\njourneyed to Khartoum as soon as his religious education was completed,\r\nand became a disciple of the renowned and holy Sheikh, Mohammed Sherif.\r\n\r\nHis devotion to his superior, to his studies and to the practice of\r\nausterities, and a strange personal influence he was already beginning\r\nto show, won him by degrees a few disciples of his own: and with them\r\nhe retired to the island of Abba. Here by the waters of the White Nile\r\nMohammed Ahmed lived for several years. His two brothers, who were\r\nboat-builders in the neighbourhood, supported him by their industry. But\r\nit must have been an easy burden, for we read that he 'hollowed out for\r\nhimself a cave in the mud bank, and lived in almost entire seclusion,\r\nfasting often for days, and occasionally paying a visit to the head of\r\nthe order to assure him of his devotion and obedience.' [I take this\r\npassage from FIRE AND SWORD IN THE SOUDAN, by Slatin. His account is the\r\nmost graphic and trustworthy of all known records of the Mahdi. He had\r\nterrible opportunities of collecting information. I have followed his\r\nversion (chapter iv.) very closely on this subject.] Meanwhile his\r\nsanctity increased, and the labour and charity of the brothers were\r\nassisted by the alms of godly travellers on the river.\r\n\r\nThis virtuous and frugal existence was disturbed and terminated by an\r\nuntoward event. The renowned and holy Sheikh made a feast to celebrate\r\nthe circumcision of his sons. That the merriment of the auspicious\r\noccasion and the entertainment of the guests might be increased, Sherif,\r\naccording to the lax practice of the time, granted a dispensation from\r\nany sins committed during the festivities, and proclaimed in God's name\r\nthe suspension of the rules against singing and dancing by which the\r\nreligious orders were bound. The ascetic of Abba island did not join\r\nin these seemingly innocent dissipations. With the recklessness of the\r\nreformer he protested against the demoralisation of the age, and loudly\r\naffirmed the doctrine that God alone could forgive sins. These things\r\nwere speedily brought to the ears of the renowned Sheikh, and in all the\r\nrighteous indignation that accompanies detected wrong-doing, he summoned\r\nMohammed Ahmed before him. The latter obeyed. He respected his superior.\r\nHe was under obligations to him. His ire had disappeared as soon as it\r\nhad been expressed. He submissively entreated forgiveness; but in vain.\r\nSherif felt that some sort of discipline must be maintained among his\r\nflock. He had connived at disobedience to the divine law. All the\r\nmore must he uphold his own authority. Rising in anger, he drove the\r\npresumptuous disciple from his presence with bitter words, and expunged\r\nhis name from the order of the elect.\r\n\r\nMohammed went home. He was greatly distressed. Yet his fortunes were\r\nnot ruined. His sanctity was still a valuable and, unless he chose\r\notherwise, an inalienable asset. The renowned Sheikh had a rival--nearly\r\nas holy and more enterprising than himself. From him the young priest\r\nmight expect a warm welcome. Nevertheless he did not yet abandon his\r\nformer superior. Placing a heavy wooden collar on his neck, clad in\r\nsackcloth and sprinkled with ashes, he again returned to his spiritual\r\nleader, and in this penitential guise implored pardon. He was\r\nignominiously ejected. Nor did he venture to revisit the unforgiving\r\nSheikh. But it happened that in a few weeks Sherif had occasion to\r\njourney to the island of Abba. His former disciple appeared suddenly\r\nbefore him, still clad in sackcloth and defiled by ashes. Careless\r\nof his plain misery, and unmoved by his loyalty, which was the more\r\nremarkable since it was disinterested, the implacable Sheikh poured\r\nforth a stream of invective. Among many insults, one went home: 'Be off,\r\nyou wretched Dongolawi.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the natives of the Dongola province were despised and disliked\r\nin the Southern Soudan, it is not at first apparent why Mohammed should\r\nhave resented so bitterly the allusion to his birthplace. But abuse\r\nby class is a dangerous though effective practice. A man will perhaps\r\ntolerate an offensive word applied to himself, but will be infuriated if\r\nhis nation, his rank, or his profession is insulted.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ahmed rose. All that man could do to make amends he had done.\r\nNow he had been publicly called 'a wretched Dongolawi.' Henceforth he\r\nwould afflict Sherif with his repentance no longer. Reaching his house,\r\nhe informed his disciples--for they had not abandoned him in all his\r\ntrouble--that the Sheikh had finally cast him off, and that he would\r\nnow take his discarded allegiance elsewhere. The rival, the Sheikh el\r\nKoreishi, lived near Mesalamia. He was jealous of Sherif and envied him\r\nhis sanctimonious disciples. He was therefore delighted to receive\r\na letter from Mohammed Ahmed announcing his breach with his former\r\nsuperior and offering his most devoted services. He returned a cordial\r\ninvitation, and the priest of Abba island made all preparation for the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThis new development seems to have startled the unforgiving Sherif. It\r\nwas no part of his policy to alienate his followers, still less to add\r\nto those of his rival. After all, the quality of mercy was high and\r\nnoble. He would at last graciously forgive the impulsive but repentant\r\ndisciple. He wrote him a letter to this effect. But it was now too late.\r\nMohammed replied with grave dignity that he had committed no crime,\r\nthat he sought no forgiveness, and that 'a wretched Dongolawi' would\r\nnot offend by his presence the renowned Sheikh el Sherif. After this\r\nindulgence he departed to Mesalamia.\r\n\r\nBut the fame of his doings spread far and wide throughout the land.\r\n'Even in distant Darfur it was the principal topic of conversation'\r\n[Slatin, FIRE AND SWORD]. Rarely had a Fiki been known to offend his\r\nsuperior; never to refuse his forgiveness. Mohammed did not hesitate to\r\ndeclare that he had done what he had done as a protest against the decay\r\nof religious fervour and the torpor of the times. Since his conduct had\r\nactually caused his dismissal, it appears that he was quite justified\r\nin making a virtue of necessity. At any rate he was believed, and the\r\npeople groaning under oppression looked from all the regions to the\r\nfigure that began to grow on the political horizon. His fame grew.\r\nRumour, loud-tongued, carried it about the land that a great Reformer\r\nwas come to purify the faith and break the stony apathy which paralysed\r\nthe hearts of Islam. Whisperings added that a man was found who should\r\nbreak from off the necks of the tribes the hateful yoke of Egypt.\r\nMohammed now deliberately entered upon the path of ambition.\r\n\r\nThroughout Nubia the Shukri belief prevails: some day, in a time of\r\nshame and trouble, a second great Prophet will arise--a Mahdi who shall\r\nlead the faithful nearer God and sustain the religion. The people of the\r\nSoudan always look inquiringly to any ascetic who rises to fame, and the\r\nquestion is often repeated, 'Art thou he that should come, or do we look\r\nfor another?' Of this powerful element of disturbance Mohammed Ahmed\r\nresolved to avail himself. He requested and obtained the permission of\r\nthe Sheikh Koreishi to return to Abba, where he was well known, and with\r\nwhich island village his name was connected, and so came back in triumph\r\nto the scene of his disgrace. Thither many pilgrims began to resort.\r\nHe received valuable presents, which he distributed to the poor, who\r\nacclaimed him as 'Zahed'--a renouncer of earthly pleasures. He journeyed\r\npreaching through Kordofan, and received the respect of the priesthood\r\nand the homage of the people. And while he spoke of the purification of\r\nthe religion, they thought that the burning words might be applied to\r\nthe freedom of the soil. He supported his sermons by writings, which\r\nwere widely read. When a few months later the Sheikh Koreishi died,\r\nthe priest of Abba proceeded forthwith to erect a tomb to his memory,\r\ndirecting and controlling the voluntary labours of the reverent Arabs\r\nwho carried the stones.\r\n\r\nWhile Mohammed was thus occupied he received the support of a man, less\r\nvirtuous than but nearly as famous as himself. Abdullah was one of four\r\nbrothers, the sons of an obscure priest; but he inherited no great\r\nlove of religion or devotion to its observances. He was a man of\r\ndetermination and capacity. He set before himself two distinct\r\nambitions, both of which he accomplished: to free the Soudan of\r\nforeigners, and to rule it himself. He seems to have had a queer\r\npresentiment of his career. This much he knew: there would be a great\r\nreligious leader, and he would be his lieutenant and his successor.\r\nWhen Zubehr conquered Darfur, Abdullah presented himself before him\r\nand hailed him as 'the expected Mahdi.' Zubehr, however, protested with\r\nsuperfluous energy that he was no saint, and the impulsive patriot was\r\ncompelled to accept his assurances. So soon as he saw Mohammed Ahmed\r\nrising to fame and displaying qualities of courage and energy, he\r\nhastened to throw himself at his feet and assure him of his devotion.\r\n\r\nNo part of Slatin Pasha's fascinating account of his perils and\r\nsufferings is so entertaining as that in which Abdullah, then become\r\nKhalifa of the whole Soudan, describes his early struggles and\r\nadversity:\r\n\r\n'Indeed it was a very troublesome journey. At that time my entire\r\nproperty consisted of one donkey, and he had a gall on his back, so\r\nthat I could not ride him. But I made him carry my water-skin and bag of\r\ncorn, over which I spread my rough cotton garment, and drove him along\r\nin front of me. At that time I wore the white cotton shirt, like the\r\nrest of my tribe. My clothes and my dialect at once marked me out as a\r\nstranger wherever I went; and when I crossed the Nile I was frequently\r\ngreeted with \"What do you want? Go back to your own country. There is\r\nnothing to steal here.\"'\r\n\r\nWhat a life of ups and downs! It was a long stride from the ownership of\r\none saddle-galled donkey to the undisputed rule of an empire. The weary\r\nwayfarer may have dreamed of this, for ambition stirs imagination nearly\r\nas much as imagination excites ambition. But further he could not expect\r\nor wish to see. Nor could he anticipate as, in the complacency of a\r\nman who had done with evil days, he told the story of his rise to the\r\nsubmissive Slatin, that the day would come when he would lead an army\r\nof more than fifty thousand men to destruction, and that the night would\r\nfollow when, almost alone, his empire shrunk again to the saddle-galled\r\ndonkey, he would seek his home in distant Kordofan, while this same\r\nSlatin who knelt so humbly before him would lay the fierce pursuing\r\nsquadrons on the trail.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ahmed received his new adherent kindly, but without enthusiasm.\r\nFor some months Abdullah carried stones to build the tomb of the Sheikh\r\nel Koreishi. Gradually they got to know each other. 'But long before he\r\nentrusted me with his secret,' said Abdullah to Slatin, 'I knew that he\r\nwas \"the expected Guide.\"' [Slatin, FIRE AND SWORD, p.131.] And though\r\nthe world might think that the 'Messenger of God' was sent to lead men\r\nto happiness in heaven, Abdullah attached to the phrase a significance\r\nof his own, and knew that he should lead him to power on earth. The\r\ntwo formed a strong combination. The Mahdi--for such Mohammed Ahmed\r\nhad already in secret announced himself--brought the wild enthusiasm\r\nof religion, the glamour of a stainless life, and the influence of\r\nsuperstition into the movement. But if he were the soul of the plot,\r\nAbdullah was the brain. He was the man of the world, the practical\r\npolitician, the general.\r\n\r\nThere now commenced a great conspiracy against the Egyptian Government.\r\nIt was fostered by the discontents and justified by the miseries of the\r\npeople of the Soudan. The Mahdi began to collect adherents and to extend\r\nhis influence in all parts of the country. He made a second journey\r\nthrough Kordofan, and received everywhere promises of support from\r\nall classes. The most distant tribes sent assurances of devotion and\r\nreverence, and, what was of more importance, of armed assistance. The\r\nsecret could not be long confined to those who welcomed the movement. As\r\nthe ramifications of the plot spread they were perceived by the renowned\r\nSheikh Sherif, who still nursed his chagrin and thirsted for revenge. He\r\nwarned the Egyptian Government. They, knowing his envy and hatred of\r\nhis former disciple, discounted his evidence and for some time paid no\r\nattention to the gathering of the storm. But presently more\r\ntrustworthy witnesses confirmed his statements, and Raouf Pasha, then\r\nGovernor-General, finding himself confronted with a growing agitation,\r\ndetermined to act. He accordingly sent a messenger to the island of\r\nAbba, to summon Mohammed Ahmed to Khartoum to justify his behaviour and\r\nexplain his intentions. The news of the despatch of the messenger was\r\nswiftly carried to the Mahdi! He consulted with his trusty lieutenant.\r\nThey decided to risk everything, and without further delay to defy the\r\nGovernment. When it is remembered how easily an organised army, even\r\nthough it be in a bad condition, can stamp out the beginnings of revolt\r\namong a population, the courage of their resolve must be admired.\r\n\r\nThe messenger arrived. He was received with courtesy by Abdullah, and\r\nforthwith conducted before the Mahdi. He delivered his message, and\r\nurged Mohammed Ahmed to comply with the orders of the Governor-General.\r\nThe Mahdi listened for some time in silence, but with increasing\r\nemotion; and when the messenger advised him, as he valued his own\r\nsafety, to journey to Khartoum, if only to justify himself, his passion\r\novercame him. 'What!' he shouted, rising suddenly and striking his\r\nbreast with his hand. 'By the grace of God and his Prophet I am master\r\nof this country, and never shall I go to Khartoum to justify myself.'\r\n[Slatin, FIRE AND SWORD, p.135.] The terrified messenger withdrew. The\r\nrebellion of the Mahdi had begun.\r\n\r\nBoth the priest and the Governor-General prepared for military\r\nenterprise. The Mahdi proclaimed a holy war against the foreigners,\r\nalike the enemies of God and the scourge of men. He collected his\r\nfollowers. He roused the local tribes. He wrote letters to all parts of\r\nthe Soudan, calling upon the people to fight for a purified religion,\r\nthe freedom of the soil, and God's holy prophet 'the expected Mahdi.'\r\nHe promised the honour of men to those who lived, the favour of God\r\nto those who fell, and lastly that the land should be cleared of the\r\nmiserable 'Turk.' 'Better,' he said, and it became the watchword of\r\nthe revolt, 'thousands of graves than a dollar tax.' [Ohrwalder, TEN\r\nYEARS' CAPTIVITY IN THE MAHDI'S CAMP.]\r\n\r\nNor was Raouf Pasha idle. He sent two companies of infantry with one gun\r\nby steamer to Abba to arrest the fanatic who disturbed the public peace.\r\nWhat followed is characteristically Egyptian. Each company was commanded\r\nby a captain. To encourage their efforts, whichever officer captured the\r\nMahdi was promised promotion. At sunset on an August evening in 1881\r\nthe steamer arrived at Abba. The promise of the Governor-General had\r\nprovoked the strife, not the emulation of the officers. Both landed with\r\ntheir companies and proceeded by different routes under the cover of\r\ndarkness to the village where the Mahdi dwelt. Arriving simultaneously\r\nfrom opposite directions, they fired into each other, and, in the midst\r\nof this mistaken combat, the Mahdi rushed upon them with his scanty\r\nfollowing and destroyed them impartially. A few soldiers succeeded in\r\nreaching the bank of the river. But the captain of the steamer would run\r\nno risks, and those who could not swim out to the vessel were left to\r\ntheir fate. With such tidings the expedition returned to Khartoum.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ahmed had been himself wounded in the attack, but the faithful\r\nAbdullah bound up the injury, so that none might know that God's Prophet\r\nhad been pierced by carnal weapons. The effect of the success was\r\nelectrical. The news spread throughout the Soudan. Men with sticks\r\nhad slain men with rifles. A priest had destroyed the soldiers of\r\nthe Government. Surely this was the Expected One. The Mahdi, however,\r\nprofited by his victory only to accomplish a retreat without loss of\r\nprestige. Abdullah had no illusions. More troops would be sent. They\r\nwere too near to Khartoum. Prudence counselled flight to regions\r\nmore remote. But before this new Hegira the Mahdi appointed his four\r\nKhalifas, in accordance with prophecy and precedent. The first was\r\nAbdullah. Of the others it is only necessary at this moment to notice\r\nAli-Wad-Helu, the chief of one of the local tribes, and among the first\r\nto rally to the standard of revolt.\r\n\r\nThen the retreat began; but it was more like a triumphal progress.\r\nAttended by a considerable following, and preceded by tales of the most\r\nwonderful miracles and prodigies, the Mahdi retired to a mountain\r\nin Kordofan to which he gave the name of Jebel Masa, that being the\r\nmountain whence 'the expected Guide' is declared in the Koran sooner or\r\nlater to appear. He was now out of reach of Khartoum, but within reach\r\nof Fashoda. The Egyptian Governor of that town, Rashid Bey, a man of\r\nmore enterprise and even less military knowledge than is usual in his\r\nrace, determined to make all attempt to seize the rebel and disperse his\r\nfollowing. Taking no precautions, he fell on the 9th of December into an\r\nambush, was attacked unprepared, and was himself, with fourteen hundred\r\nmen, slaughtered by the ill-armed but valiant Arabs.\r\n\r\nThe whole country stirred. The Government, thoroughly alarmed by the\r\nserious aspect the revolt had assumed, organised a great expedition.\r\nFour thousand troops under Yusef, a Pasha of distinguished reputation,\r\nwere sent against the rebels. Meanwhile the Mahdi and his followers\r\nsuffered the extremes of want. Their cause was as yet too perilous for\r\nthe rich to join. Only the poor flocked to the holy standard. All that\r\nMohammed possessed he gave away, keeping nothing for himself, excepting\r\nonly a horse to lead his followers in battle. Abdullah walked.\r\nNevertheless the rebels were half-famished, and armed with scarcely any\r\nmore deadly weapons than sticks and stones. The army of the Government\r\napproached slowly. Their leaders anticipated an easy victory. Their\r\ncontempt for the enemy was supreme. They did not even trouble themselves\r\nto post sentries by night, but slept calmly inside a slender thorn\r\nfence, unwatched save by their tireless foes. And so it came to pass\r\nthat in the half-light of the early morning of the 7th of June the\r\nMahdi, his ragged Khalifas, and his almost naked army rushed upon them,\r\nand slew them to a man.\r\n\r\nThe victory was decisive. Southern Kordofan was at the feet of the\r\npriest of Abba. Stores of arms and ammunition had fallen into his hands.\r\nThousands of every class hastened to join his standard. No one\r\ndoubted that he was the divine messenger sent to free them from their\r\noppressors. The whole of the Arab tribes all over the Soudan rose at\r\nonce. The revolt broke out simultaneously in Sennar and Darfur, and\r\nspread to provinces still more remote. The smaller Egyptian posts,\r\nthe tax-gatherers and local administrators, were massacred in every\r\ndistrict. Only the larger garrisons maintained themselves in the\r\nprincipal towns. They were at once blockaded. All communications were\r\ninterrupted. All legal authority was defied. Only the Mahdi was obeyed.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to look for a moment to Egypt. The misgovernment\r\nwhich in the Soudan had caused the rebellion of the Mahdi, in Egypt\r\nproduced the revolt of Arabi Pasha. As the people of the Soudan longed\r\nto be rid of the foreign oppressors--the so-called 'Turks'--so those of\r\nthe Delta were eager to free themselves from the foreign regulators and\r\nthe real Turkish influence. While men who lived by the sources of the\r\nNile asserted that tribes did not exist for officials to harry, others\r\nwho dwelt at its mouth protested that nations were not made to be\r\nexploited by creditors or aliens. The ignorant south found their leader\r\nin a priest: the more educated north looked to a soldier. Mohammed Ahmed\r\nbroke the Egyptian yoke; Arabi gave expression to the hatred of the\r\nEgyptians for the Turks. But although the hardy Arabs might scatter the\r\neffete Egyptians, the effete Egyptians were not likely to disturb the\r\nsolid battalions of Europe. After much hesitation and many attempts at\r\ncompromise, the Liberal Administration of Mr. Gladstone sent a fleet\r\nwhich reduced the forts of Alexandria to silence and the city to\r\nanarchy. The bombardment of the fleet was followed by the invasion of\r\na powerful army. Twenty-five thousand men were landed in Egypt. The\r\ncampaign was conducted with celerity and skill. The Egyptian armies\r\nwere slaughtered or captured. Their patriotic but commonplace leader was\r\nsentenced to death and condemned to exile, and Great Britain assumed the\r\ndirection of Egyptian affairs.\r\n\r\nThe British soon restored law and order in Egypt, and the question\r\nof the revolt in the Soudan came before the English advisers of the\r\nKhedive. Notwithstanding the poverty and military misfortunes which\r\ndepressed the people of the Delta, the desire to hold their southern\r\nprovinces was evident. The British Government, which at that time was\r\ndetermined to pursue a policy of non-interference in the Soudan, gave a\r\ntacit consent, and another great expedition was prepared to suppress the\r\nFalse Prophet, as the English and Egyptians deemed him--'the expected\r\nMahdi,' as the people of the Soudan believed.\r\n\r\nA retired officer of the Indian Staff Corps and a few European officers\r\nof various nationalities were sent to Khartoum to organise the new field\r\nforce. Meanwhile the Mahdi, having failed to take by storm, laid siege\r\nto El Obeid, the chief town of Kordofan. During the summer of 1883 the\r\nEgyptian troops gradually concentrated at Khartoum until a considerable\r\narmy was formed. It was perhaps the worst army that has ever marched to\r\nwar. One extract from General Hicks's letters will suffice. Writing on\r\nthe 8th of June, 1883, to Sir E. Wood, he says incidentally: 'Fifty-one\r\nmen of the Krupp battery deserted on the way here, although in chains.'\r\nThe officers and men who had been defeated fighting for their own\r\nliberties at Tel-el-Kebir were sent to be destroyed, fighting to take\r\naway the liberties of others in the Soudan. They had no spirit, no\r\ndiscipline, hardly any training, and in a force of over eight thousand\r\nmen there were scarcely a dozen capable officers. The two who were the\r\nmost notable of these few--General Hicks, who commanded, and Colonel\r\nFarquhar, the Chief of the Staff--must be remarked.\r\n\r\nEl Obeid had fallen before the ill-fated expedition left Khartoum; but\r\nthe fact that Slatin Bey, an Austrian officer in the Egyptian service,\r\nwas still maintaining himself in Darfur provided it with an object. On\r\nthe 9th of September Hicks and his army (the actual strength of\r\nwhich was 7,000 infantry, 400 mounted Bashi Bazuks, 500 cavalry, 100\r\nCircassians, 10 mounted guns, 4 Krupps, and 6 Nordenfeldt machine guns)\r\nleft Omdurman and marched to Duem. Although the actual command of the\r\nexpedition was vested in the English officer, Ala-ed-Din Pasha, the\r\nGovernor-General who had succeeded Raouf Pasha, exercised an uncertain\r\nauthority. Differences of opinion were frequent, though all the officers\r\nwere agreed in taking the darkest views of their chances. The miserable\r\nhost toiled slowly onward towards its destruction, marching in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction through Shat and Rahad. Here the condition of\r\nthe force was so obviously demoralised that a German servant (Gustav\r\nKlootz, the servant of Baron Seckendorf) actually deserted to the\r\nMahdi's camp. He was paraded in triumph as an English officer.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the Government troops the Mahdi had marched out of\r\nEl Obeid and established himself in the open country, where he made his\r\nfollowers live under military conditions and continually practised them\r\nin warlike evolutions. More than forty thousand men collected round his\r\nstandard, and the Arabs were now armed with several thousand rifles and\r\na few cannon, as well as a great number of swords and spears. To these\r\nproportions had the little band of followers who fought at Abba grown!\r\nThe disparity of the forces was apparent before the battle. The Mahdi\r\nthereupon wrote to Hicks, calling on him to surrender and offering\r\nterms. His proposals were treated with disdain, although the probable\r\nresult of an engagement was clear.\r\n\r\nUntil the expedition reached Rahad only a few cavalry patrols had\r\nwatched its slow advance. But on the 1st of November the Mahdi left\r\nEl Obeid and marched with his whole power to meet his adversary. The\r\ncollision took place on the 3rd of November. All through that day the\r\nEgyptians struggled slowly forward, in great want of water, losing\r\ncontinually from the fire of the Soudanese riflemen, and leaving several\r\nguns behind them. On the next morning they were confronted by the\r\nmain body of the Arab army, and their attempts to advance further were\r\ndefeated with heavy loss. The force began to break up. Yet another day\r\nwas consumed before it was completely destroyed. Scarcely five hundred\r\nEgyptians escaped death; hardly as many of the Arabs fell. The European\r\nofficers perished fighting to the end; and the general met his fate\r\nsword in hand, at the head of the last formed body of his troops, his\r\npersonal valour and physical strength exciting the admiration even of\r\nthe fearless enemy, so that in chivalrous respect they buried his body\r\nwith barbaric honours. Mohammed Ahmed celebrated his victory with a\r\nsalute of one hundred guns; and well he might, for the Soudan was now\r\nhis, and his boast that, by God's grace and the favour of the Prophet,\r\nhe was the master of all the land had been made good by force of arms.\r\n\r\nNo further attempt was made to subdue the country. The people of the\r\nSoudan had won their freedom by their valour and by the skill and\r\ncourage of their saintly leader. It only remained to evacuate the towns\r\nand withdraw the garrisons safely. But what looked like the winding-up\r\nof one story was really the beginning of another, much longer, just as\r\nbloody, commencing in shame and disaster, but ending in triumph and, let\r\nus hope, in peace.\r\n\r\nI desire for a moment to take a more general view of the Mahdi's\r\nmovement than the narrative has allowed. The original causes were social\r\nand racial. But, great as was the misery of the people, their spirit was\r\nlow, and they would not have taken up arms merely on material grounds.\r\nThen came the Mahdi. He gave the tribes the enthusiasm they lacked. The\r\nwar broke out. It is customary to lay to the charge of Mohammed Ahmed\r\nall the blood that was spilled. To my mind it seems that he may divide\r\nthe responsibility with the unjust rulers who oppressed the land, with\r\nthe incapable commanders who muddled away the lives of their men, with\r\nthe vacillating Ministers who aggravated the misfortunes. But, whatever\r\nis set to the Mahdi's account, it should not be forgotten that he put\r\nlife and soul into the hearts of his countrymen, and freed his native\r\nland of foreigners. The poor miserable natives, eating only a handful\r\nof grain, toiling half-naked and without hope, found a new, if terrible\r\nmagnificence added to life. Within their humble breasts the spirit\r\nof the Mahdi roused the fires of patriotism and religion. Life became\r\nfilled with thrilling, exhilarating terrors. They existed in a new and\r\nwonderful world of imagination. While they lived there were great things\r\nto be done; and when they died, whether it were slaying the Egyptians\r\nor charging the British squares, a Paradise which they could understand\r\nawaited them. There are many Christians who reverence the faith of Islam\r\nand yet regard the Mahdi merely as a commonplace religious impostor whom\r\nforce of circumstances elevated to notoriety. In a certain sense, this\r\nmay be true. But I know not how a genuine may be distinguished from a\r\nspurious Prophet, except by the measure of his success. The triumphs of\r\nthe Mahdi were in his lifetime far greater than those of the founder\r\nof the Mohammedan faith; and the chief difference between orthodox\r\nMohammedanism and Mahdism was that the original impulse was opposed only\r\nby decaying systems of government and society and the recent movement\r\ncame in contact with civilisation and the machinery of science.\r\nRecognising this, I do not share the popular opinion, and I believe that\r\nif in future years prosperity should come to the peoples of the Upper\r\nNile, and learning and happiness follow in its train, then the first\r\nArab historian who shall investigate the early annals of that new nation\r\nwill not forget, foremost among the heroes of his race, to write the\r\nname of Mohammed Ahmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: THE FATE OF THE ENVOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll great movements, every vigorous impulse that a community may feel,\r\nbecome perverted and distorted as time passes, and the atmosphere of\r\nthe earth seems fatal to the noble aspirations of its peoples. A wide\r\nhumanitarian sympathy in a nation easily degenerates into hysteria.\r\nA military spirit tends towards brutality. Liberty leads to licence,\r\nrestraint to tyranny. The pride of race is distended to blustering\r\narrogance. The fear of God produces bigotry and superstition. There\r\nappears no exception to the mournful rule, and the best efforts of men,\r\nhowever glorious their early results, have dismal endings, like plants\r\nwhich shoot and bud and put forth beautiful flowers, and then grow rank\r\nand coarse and are withered by the winter. It is only when we reflect\r\nthat the decay gives birth to fresh life, and that new enthusiasms\r\nspring up to take the places of those that die, as the acorn is\r\nnourished by the dead leaves of the oak, the hope strengthens that the\r\nrise and fall of men and their movements are only the changing foliage\r\nof the ever-growing tree of life, while underneath a greater evolution\r\ngoes on continually.\r\n\r\nThe movement which Mohammed Ahmed created did not escape the common fate\r\nof human enterprise; nor was it long before the warm generous blood of\r\na patriotic and religious revolt congealed into the dark clot of a\r\nmilitary empire. With the expulsion or destruction of the foreign\r\nofficials, soldiers, and traders, the racial element began to subside.\r\nThe reason for its existence was removed. With the increasing disorders\r\nthe social agitation dwindled; for communism pre-supposes wealth, and\r\nthe wealth of the Soudan was greatly diminished. There remained only the\r\nfanatical fury which the belief in the divine mission of the Mahdi had\r\nexcited; and as the necessity for a leader passed away, the belief in\r\nhis sanctity grew weaker. But meanwhile a new force was making itself\r\nfelt on the character of the revolt. The triumph no less than the\r\nplunder which had rewarded the Mahdi's victories had called into\r\nexistence a military spirit distinct from the warlike passions of the\r\ntribesmen--the spirit of the professional soldier.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Khartoum was carried on while this new influence was taking\r\nthe place of the original forces of revolt. There was a period when a\r\nneutral point was obtained and the Mahdist power languished. But the\r\ninvasion of the Eastern Soudan by the British troops in the spring and\r\nthe necessary advance of the relieving columns in the winter of 1884\r\nrevived the patriotic element. The tribes who had made a great effort\r\nto free themselves from foreign domination saw in the operations of Sir\r\nGerald Graham and Lord Wolseley an attempt to bring them again under the\r\nyoke. The impulse which was given to the Mahdi's cause was sufficient\r\nto raise a fierce opposition to the invading forces. The delay in the\r\ndespatch of the relief expedition had sealed the fate of Khartoum, and\r\nthe fall of the town established the supremacy of the military spirit on\r\nwhich the Dervish Empire was afterwards founded.\r\n\r\nAll the warlike operations of Mohammedan peoples are characterised by\r\nfanaticism, but with this general reservation it may be said--that the\r\nArabs who destroyed Yusef, who assaulted El Obeid, who annihilated\r\nHicks fought in the glory of religious zeal; that the Arabs who opposed\r\nGraham, Earle, and Stewart fought in defence of the soil; and that the\r\nArabs who were conquered by Kitchener fought in the pride of an army.\r\nFanatics charged at Shekan; patriots at Abu Klea; warriors at Omdurman.\r\n\r\nIn order to describe conveniently the changing character of the revolt,\r\nI have anticipated the story and must revert to a period when the social\r\nand racial influences were already weakening and the military spirit\r\nwas not yet grown strong. If the defeat of Yusef Pasha decided the whole\r\npeople of the Soudan to rise in arms and strike for their liberties, the\r\ndefeat of Hicks satisfied the British Government that those liberties\r\nwere won. The powerful influence of the desire to rule prompted the\r\nKhedive's Ministers to make still further efforts to preserve their\r\ncountry's possessions. Had Egypt been left to herself, other desperate\r\nefforts would have been made. But the British Government had finally\r\nabandoned the policy of non-interference with Egyptian action in the\r\nSoudan. They 'advised' its abandonment. The protests of Sherif Pasha\r\nprovoked Lord Granville to explain the meaning of the word 'advice.' The\r\nKhedive bowed to superior authority. The Minister resigned. The policy\r\nof evacuation was firmly adopted. 'Let us,' said the Ministers, 'collect\r\nthe garrisons and come away.' It was simple to decide on the course to\r\nbe pursued, but almost impossible to follow it. Several of the Egyptian\r\ngarrisons, as in Darfur and El Obeid, had already fallen. The others\r\nwere either besieged, like Sennar, Tokar, and Sinkat, or cut off from\r\nthe north, as in the case of the Equatorial Province, by the area of\r\nrebellion. The capital of the Soudan was, however, as yet unmolested;\r\nand as its Egyptian population exceeded the aggregate of the provincial\r\ntowns, the first task of the Egyptian Government was obvious.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's Administration had repressed the revolt of Arabi Pasha.\r\nThrough their policy the British were in armed occupation of Egypt.\r\nBritish officers were reorganising the army. A British official\r\nsupervised the finances. A British plenipotentiary 'advised' the\r\nre-established Tewfik. A British fleet lay attentive before the ruins\r\nof Alexandria, and it was evident that Great Britain could annex the\r\ncountry in name as well as in fact. But Imperialism was not the object\r\nof the Radical Cabinet. Their aim was philanthropic and disinterested.\r\nAs they were now determined that the Egyptians should evacuate the\r\nSoudan, so they had always been resolved that the British should\r\nevacuate Egypt.\r\n\r\nThroughout this chapter it will be seen that the desire to get out of\r\nthe country at once is the keynote of the British policy. Every act,\r\nwhether of war or administration, is intended to be final. Every\r\ndespatch is directed to breaking the connection between the two\r\ncountries and winding up the severed strings. But responsibilities which\r\nhad been lightly assumed clung like the shirt of Nessus. The ordinary\r\npractice of civilised nations demanded that some attempt should be\r\nmade to justify interference by reorganisation. The British Government\r\nwatched therefore with anxious solicitude the efforts of Egypt to\r\nevacuate the Soudan and bring the garrisons safely home. They utterly\r\ndeclined to assist with military force, but they were generous with\r\ntheir advice. Everybody at that time distrusted the capacities of the\r\nEgyptians, and it was thought the evacuation might be accomplished if\r\nit were entrusted to stronger and more honest men than were bred by the\r\nbanks of the Nile. The Ministers looked about them, wondering how\r\nthey could assist the Egyptian Government without risk or expense to\r\nthemselves, and in an evil hour for their fame and fortunes someone\r\nwhispered the word 'Gordon.' Forthwith they proceeded to telegraph to\r\nCairo: 'Would General Charles Gordon be of any use to you or to the\r\nEgyptian Government; and, if so, in what capacity'? The Egyptian\r\nGovernment replied through Sir Evelyn Baring that as the movement in\r\nthe Soudan was partly religious they were 'very much averse' from the\r\nappointment of a Christian in high command. The eyes of all those who\r\npossessed local knowledge were turned to a different person. There was\r\none man who might stem the tide of Mahdism, who might perhaps restore\r\nthe falling dominion of Egypt, who might at least save the garrisons of\r\nthe Soudan. In their necessity and distress the Khedivial advisers and\r\nthe British plenipotentiary looked as a desperate remedy to the man\r\nwhose liberty they had curtailed, whose property they had confiscated,\r\nand whose son they had executed--Zubehr Pasha.\r\n\r\nThis was the agent for whom the Government of Egypt hankered. The idea\r\nwas supported by all who were acquainted with the local conditions. A\r\nweek after Sir Evelyn Baring had declined General Gordon's services he\r\nwrote: 'Whatever may be Zubehr's faults, he is said to be a man of\r\ngreat energy and resolution. The Egyptian Government considers that his\r\nservices may be very useful.... Baker Pasha is anxious to avail himself\r\nof Zubehr Pasha's services.'[Sir Evelyn Baring, letter of December 9,\r\n1883.] It is certain that had the Egyptian Government been a free agent,\r\nZubehr would have been sent to the Soudan as its Sultan, and assisted by\r\narms, money, and perhaps by men, to make head against the Mahdi. It is\r\nprobable that at this particular period the Mahdi would have collapsed\r\nbefore a man whose fame was nearly equal to, and whose resources would\r\nhave been much greater than, his own. But the British Ministry would\r\ncountenance no dealings with such a man. They scouted the idea of\r\nZubehr, and by so doing increased their obligation to suggest an\r\nalternative. Zubehr being rejected, Gordon remained. It is scarcely\r\npossible to conceive a greater contrast than that which these two men\r\npresented. It was a leap from the Equator to the North Pole.\r\n\r\nWhen difficulties and dangers perplex all minds, it has often happened\r\nin history that many men by different lines of thought arrive at the\r\nsame conclusion. No complete record has yet been published of the\r\ntelegrams which passed between the Government and their agent at this\r\njuncture. The Blue-books preserve a disingenuous discretion. But it is\r\nknown that from the very first Sir Evelyn Baring was bitterly opposed\r\nto General Gordon's appointment. No personal friendship existed\r\nbetween them, and the Administrator dreaded the return to the feverish\r\ncomplications of Egyptian politics of the man who had always been\r\nidentified with unrest, improvisation, and disturbance. The pressure\r\nwas, however, too strong for him to withstand. Nubar Pasha, the Foreign\r\nOffice, the British public, everyone clamoured for the appointment.\r\nHad Baring refused to give way, it is probable that he would have been\r\noverruled. At length he yielded, and, as soon as his consent had been\r\nobtained, the government turned with delight to Gordon. On the 17th of\r\nJanuary Lord Wolseley requested him to come to England. On the 18th he\r\nmet the Cabinet. That same night he started on the long journey from\r\nwhich he was never to return.\r\n\r\nGordon embarked on his mission in high spirits, sustained by that belief\r\nin personality which too often misleads great men and beautiful women.\r\nIt was, he said, the greatest honour ever conferred upon him. Everything\r\nsmiled. The nation was delighted. The Ministers were intensely relieved.\r\nThe most unbounded confidence was reposed in the envoy. His interview\r\nwith the Khedive was 'very satisfactory.' His complete authority was\r\nproclaimed to all the notables and natives of the Soudan [Proclamation\r\nof the Khedive, January 26, 1884.] He was assured of the support of the\r\nEgyptian Government [Sir E. Baring to Major-General Gordon, January 25,\r\n1884.] The London Foreign Office, having with becoming modesty admitted\r\nthat they had not 'sufficient local knowledge,' [Earl Granville to Sir\r\nE. Baring, January 22, 1884.] accorded him 'widest discretionary\r\npower.' [Sir E. Baring to Earl Granville, February 1, 1884.] One hundred\r\nthousand pounds was placed to his credit, and he was informed that\r\nfurther sums would be supplied when this was exhausted. He was assured\r\nthat no effort would be wanting on the part of the Cairene authorities,\r\nwhether English or Egyptian, to afford him all the support and\r\nco-operation in their power [Sir E. Baring to Major-General Gordon,\r\nJanuary 25, 1884.] 'There is no sort of difference,' wrote Sir Evelyn\r\nBaring, 'between General Gordon's views and those entertained by Nubar\r\nPasha and myself.' [Sir E. Baring to Earl Granville, February 1,1884.]\r\nUnder these propitious auguries the dismal and disastrous enterprise\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nHis task, though difficult and, as it ultimately proved, impossible, was\r\nclearly defined. 'You will bear in mind,' wrote Sir Evelyn Baring,\r\n'that the main end to be pursued is the evacuation of the Soudan.' 'The\r\nobject... of your mission to the Soudan,' declared the Khedive, 'is to\r\ncarry into execution the evacuation of those territories and to withdraw\r\nour troops, civil officials, and such of the inhabitants... as may wish\r\nto leave for Egypt... and after the evacuation to take the necessary\r\nsteps for establishing an organised Government in the different\r\nprovinces.' Nor was he himself under any misconception. He drew up a\r\nmemorandum when on board the Tanjore in which he fully acquiesced in the\r\nevacuation of the Soudan. In a sentence which breathes the same spirit\r\nas Mr. Gladstone's famous expression, 'a people rightly struggling to\r\nbe free,' he wrote: 'I must say that it would be an iniquity to\r\nconquer these peoples and then hand them back to the Egyptians without\r\nguarantees of future good government.' Finally, he unhesitatingly\r\nasserted: 'No one who has ever lived in the Soudan can escape the\r\nreflection \"What a useless possession is this land!\"' And Colonel\r\nStewart, who accompanied him and endorsed the memorandum, added: 'And\r\nwhat a huge encumbrance to Egypt!' Thus far there was complete agreement\r\nbetween the British envoy and the Liberal Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of these pages to describe his long ride across\r\nthe desert from Korosko to Abu Hamed, his interview with the notables at\r\nBerber, or his proclamation of the abandonment of the Soudan, which\r\nsome affirm to have been an important cause of his ruin. On the 22nd of\r\nFebruary he arrived at Khartoum. He was received with rejoicing by the\r\nwhole population. They recognised again their just Governor-General and\r\ntheir present deliverer. Those who had been about to fly for the north\r\ntook fresh heart. They believed that behind the figure of the envoy\r\nstood the resources of an Empire. The Mahdi and the gathering Dervishes\r\nwere perplexed and alarmed. Confusion and hesitancy disturbed their\r\ncouncils and delayed their movements. Gordon had come. The armies\r\nwould follow. Both friends and foes were deceived. The great man was at\r\nKhartoum, but there he would remain--alone.\r\n\r\nWhatever confidence the General had felt in the power of his personal\r\ninfluence had been dispelled on the journey to Khartoum. He had no more\r\nillusions. His experienced eye reviewed the whole situation. He saw\r\nhimself confronted with a tremendous racial movement. The people of the\r\nSoudan had risen against foreigners. His only troops were Soudanese. He\r\nwas himself a foreigner. Foremost among the leaders of the revolt were\r\nthe Arab slave dealers, furious at the attempted suppression of their\r\ntrade. No one, not even Sir Samuel Baker, had tried harder to suppress\r\nit than Gordon. Lastly, the whole movement had assumed a fanatical\r\ncharacter. Islam marched against the infidel. Gordon was a Christian.\r\nHis own soldiers were under the spell they were to try to destroy. To\r\nthem their commander was accursed. Every influence was hostile, and in\r\nparticular hostile to his person. The combined forces of race, class,\r\nand religion were against him. He bowed before their irresistible\r\nstrength. On the very day of his arrival at Khartoum, while the\r\ntownsfolk were cheering his name in the streets and the batteries were\r\nfiring joyful salutes, while the people of England thought his mission\r\nalready accomplished and the Government congratulated themselves on the\r\nwisdom of their action, General Gordon sat himself down and telegraphed\r\na formal request to Cairo for Zubehr Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of his relations with Zubehr is extremely\r\ncharacteristic. Zubehr's son, Suliman, had been executed, if not by\r\nGordon's orders, at least during his administration of the Soudan and\r\nwith his complete approval. 'Thus,' he had said, 'does God make gaps in\r\nthe ranks of His enemies.' He had hardly started from London on his\r\nnew mission, when he telegraphed to Sir Evelyn Baring, telling him that\r\nZubehr was a most dangerous man and requesting that he might be at once\r\ndeported to Cyprus. This was, of course, quite beyond the powers or\r\nintention of the British Agent. The General arrived in Cairo like a\r\nwhirlwind close behind his telegram, and was very angry to hear that\r\nZubehr was still in Egypt. Before starting up the river he went to see\r\nSherif Pasha. In the ex-Minister's ante-room he met the very man he had\r\ndetermined to avoid--Zubehr. He greeted him with effusion. They had a\r\nlong talk about the Soudan, after which Gordon hurried to the Agency and\r\ninformed Sir Evelyn Baring that Zubehr must accompany him to Khartoum at\r\nonce. Baring was amazed. He did not himself disapprove of the plan.\r\nHe had, in fact, already recommended it. But he thought the change in\r\nGordon's attitude too sudden to be relied on. To-morrow he might change\r\nagain. He begged the General to think more seriously of the matter.\r\nGordon with his usual frankness admitted that his change of mind had\r\nbeen very sudden. He had been conscious, he said, of a 'mystic feeling'\r\nthat Zubehr was necessary to save the situation in the Soudan.\r\n\r\nGordon left Cairo still considering the matter. So soon as he made his\r\nformal demand from Khartoum for the assistance of Zubehr it was evident\r\nthat his belief in the old slave dealer's usefulness was a sound\r\nconviction and not a mere passing caprice. Besides, he had now become\r\n'the man on the spot,' and as such his words carried double force. Sir\r\nEvelyn Baring determined to support the recommendation with his whole\r\ninfluence. Never was so good a case made out for the appointment of so\r\nbad a man. The Envoy Extraordinary asked for him; Colonel Stewart, his\r\ncolleague, concurred; the British Agent strongly urged the request; the\r\nEgyptian Government were unanimous; and behind all these were ranged\r\nevery single person who had the slightest acquaintance with the Soudan.\r\nnothing could exceed the vigour with which the demand was made. On the\r\n1st of March General Gordon telegraphed: 'I tell you plainly, it is\r\nimpossible to get Cairo employees out of Khartoum unless the Government\r\nhelps in the way I told you. They refuse Zubehr.... but it was the only\r\nchance.' And again on the 8th: 'If you do not send Zubehr, you have\r\nno chance of getting the garrisons away.' 'I believe,' said Sir Evelyn\r\nBaring in support of these telegrams, 'that General Gordon is quite\r\nright when he says that Zubehr Pasha is the only possible man. Nubar is\r\nstrongly in favour of him. Dr. Bohndorf, the African traveller, fully\r\nconfirms what General Gordon says of the influence of Zubehr.' The Pasha\r\nwas vile, but indispensable.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government refused absolutely to have anything to do with\r\nZubehr. They declined to allow the Egyptian Government to employ him.\r\nThey would not entertain the proposal, and scarcely consented to discuss\r\nit. The historians of the future may occupy their leisure and exercise\r\ntheir wits in deciding whether the Ministers and the people were right\r\nor wrong; whether they had a right to indulge their sensitiveness at\r\nso terrible a cost; whether they were not more nice than wise; whether\r\ntheir dignity was more offended by what was incurred or by what was\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gordon has explained his views very clearly and concisely: 'Had\r\nZubehr Pasha been sent up when I asked for him, Berber would in\r\nall probability never have fallen, and one might have made a Soudan\r\nGovernment in opposition to the Mahdi. We choose to refuse his coming\r\nup because of his antecedents in re slave trade; granted that we had\r\nreason, yet, as we take no precautions as to the future of these lands\r\nwith respect to the slave trade, the above opposition seems absurd.\r\nI will not send up 'A' because he will do this, but I will leave the\r\ncountry to 'B', who will do exactly the same [Major-General Gordon,\r\nJOURNALS AT KHARTOUM.]\r\n\r\nBut if the justice of the decision is doubtful, its consequences were\r\nobvious. Either the British Government were concerned with the Soudan,\r\nor they were not. If they were not, then they had no reason or right to\r\nprohibit the appointment of Zubehr. If they were, they were bound to see\r\nthat the garrisons were rescued. It was an open question whether Great\r\nBritain was originally responsible for the safety of the garrisons.\r\nGeneral Gordon contended that we were bound to save them at all costs,\r\nand he backed his belief with his life. Others may hold that Governments\r\nhave no right to lay, or at any rate must be very judicious in the\r\nlaying of burdens on the backs of their own countrymen in order that\r\nthey may indulge a refined sense of chivalry towards foreigners. England\r\nhad not misgoverned the Soudan, had not raised the revolt or planted the\r\ngarrisons. All that Egypt had a right to expect was commiseration. But\r\nthe moment Zubehr was prohibited the situation was changed. The refusal\r\nto permit his employment was tantamount to an admission that affairs\r\nin the Soudan involved the honour of England as well as the honour of\r\nEgypt. When the British people--for this was not merely the act of the\r\nGovernment--adopted a high moral attitude with regard to Zubehr,\r\nthey bound themselves to rescue the garrisons, peaceably if possible,\r\nforcibly if necessary.\r\n\r\nWith their refusal to allow Zubehr to go to the Soudan began the long\r\nand miserable disagreement between the Government and their envoy.\r\nPuzzled and disturbed at the reception accorded to his first request,\r\nGordon cast about for other expedients. He had already stated that\r\nZubehr was 'the only chance.' But it is the duty of subordinates to\r\nsuggest other courses when those they recommend are rejected; and with\r\na whole-hearted enthusiasm and unreserved loyalty the General threw\r\nhimself into the affair and proposed plan after plan with apparent hope.\r\n\r\nGordon considered that he was personally pledged to effect the\r\nevacuation of Khartoum by the garrison and civil servants. He\r\nhad appointed some of the inhabitants to positions of trust, thus\r\ncompromising them with the Mahdi. Others had undoubtedly been encouraged\r\nto delay their departure by his arrival. He therefore considered that\r\nhis honour was involved in their safety. Henceforward he was inflexible.\r\nNeither rewards nor threats could move him. Nothing that men could offer\r\nwould induce him to leave Khartoum till its inhabitants were rescued.\r\nThe Government on their side were equally stubborn. Nothing, however\r\nsacred, should induce them to send troops to Khartoum, or in any way\r\ninvolve themselves in the middle of Africa. The town might fall; the\r\ngarrison might be slaughtered; their envoy--But what possibilities they\r\nwere prepared to face as regards him will not be known until all of this\r\nand the next generation are buried and forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was complete. To some men the Foreign Office might have\r\nsuggested lines of retreat, covered by the highest official praise, and\r\nleading to preferment and reward. Others would have welcomed an order to\r\nleave so perilous a post. But the man they had sent was the one man of\r\nall others who was beyond their control, who cared nothing for what they\r\ncould give or take away. So events dragged on their wretched course.\r\nGordon's proposals became more and more impracticable as the best\r\ncourses he could devise were successively vetoed by the Government,\r\nand as his irritation and disappointment increased. The editor of his\r\nJournals has enumerated them with indignant care. He had asked for\r\nZubehr. Zubehr was refused. He had requested Turkish troops. Turkish\r\ntroops were refused. He had asked for Mohammedan regiments from India.\r\nThe Government regretted their inability to comply. He asked for a\r\nFirman from the Sultan to strengthen his position. It was 'peremptorily\r\nrefused.' He proposed to go south in his steamers to Equatoria. The\r\nGovernment forbade him to proceed beyond Khartoum. He asked that 200\r\nBritish troops might be sent to Berber. They were refused. He begged\r\nthat a few might be sent to Assuan. None were sent. He proposed to\r\nvisit the Mahdi himself and try to arrange matters with him personally.\r\nPerhaps he recognised a kindred spirit. The Government in this case very\r\nnaturally forbade him.\r\n\r\nAt last the quarrel is open. He makes no effort to conceal his disgust.\r\n'I leave you,' he says, the 'indelible disgrace of abandoning the\r\ngarrisons.' [Major-General Gordon to Sir E. Baring (telegraphic),\r\nreceived at Cairo April 16.] Such abandonment is, he declares, 'the\r\nclimax of meanness.' [Ibid, despatched April 8.] He reiterates his\r\ndetermination to abide with the garrison of Khartoum. 'I will not leave\r\nthese people after all they have gone through.' [Major-General Gordon\r\nto Sir E. Baring, Khartoum, July 30; received at Cairo October 15.] He\r\ntosses his commission contemptuously from him: 'I would also ask her\r\nMajesty's Government to accept the resignation of my commission.'\r\n[Major-General Gordon to Sir E. Baring (telegraphic), Khartoum, March\r\n9.] The Government 'trust that he will not resign,' [Earl Granville\r\nto Sir E. Baring, Foreign Office, March 13.] and his offer remains\r\nin abeyance. Finally, in bitterness and vexation, thinking himself\r\nabandoned and disavowed, he appeals to Sir Evelyn Baring personally:\r\n'I feel sure, whatever you may feel diplomatically, I have your\r\nsupport--and that of every man professing himself a gentleman--in\r\nprivate'; [Major-General Gordon to Sir E. Baring (telegraphic), received\r\nat Cairo April 16.] and as a last hope he begs Sir Samuel Baker to\r\nappeal to 'British and American millionaires' to subscribe two hundred\r\nthousand pounds to enable him to carry out the evacuation without, and\r\neven in spite of, the Governments of Cairo and London; and Sir Samuel\r\nBaker writes a long letter to the Times in passionate protest and\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief features in the wretched business. Even the\r\nBlue-books in their dry recital arouse in the reader painful and\r\nindignant emotions. But meanwhile other and still more stirring events\r\nwere passing outside the world of paper and ink.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Gordon at Khartoum had seriously perplexed and alarmed\r\nMohammed Ahmed and his Khalifas. Their following was discouraged, and\r\nthey themselves feared lest the General should be the herald of armies.\r\nHis Berber proclamation reassured them, and as the weeks passed without\r\nreinforcements arriving, the Mahdi and Abdullah, with that courage\r\nwhich in several great emergencies drew them to the boldest courses,\r\ndetermined to put a brave face on the matter and blockade Khartoum\r\nitself. They were assisted in this enterprise by a revival of the\r\npatriotic impulse throughout the country and a consequent stimulus to\r\nthe revolt. To discover the cause it is necessary to look to the Eastern\r\nSoudan, where the next tragedy, after the defeat of Hicks, is laid.\r\n\r\nThe Hadendoa tribe, infuriated by oppression and misgovernment, had\r\njoined the rebellion under the leadership of the celebrated, and perhaps\r\nimmortal, Osman Digna. The Egyptian garrisons of Tokar and Sinkat were\r\nbeleaguered and hard pressed. Her Majesty's Government disclaimed all\r\nresponsibility. Yet, since these towns were not far from the coast, they\r\ndid not prohibit an attempt on the part of the Egyptian Government to\r\nrescue the besieged soldiers. Accordingly an Egyptian force 3,500 strong\r\nmarched from Suakin in February 1884 to relieve Tokar, under the command\r\nof General Baker, once the gallant colonel of the 10th Hussars. Hard by\r\nthe wells of Teb they were, on the 5th of February, attacked by about a\r\nthousand Arabs.\r\n\r\n'On the square being only threatened by a small force of the enemy...\r\nthe Egyptian troops threw down their arms and ran, carrying away the\r\nblack troops with them, and allowing themselves to be killed without\r\nthe slightest resistance.' [General Baker to Sir E. Baring, February 6\r\n(official despatch), telegraphic.] The British and European officers\r\nin vain endeavoured to rally them. The single Soudanese battalion fired\r\nimpartially on friend and foe. The general, with that unshaken courage\r\nand high military skill which had already on the Danube gained him\r\na continental reputation, collected some fifteen hundred men, mostly\r\nunarmed, and so returned to Suakin. Ninety-six officers and 2,250 men\r\nwere killed. Krupp guns, machine guns, rifles, and a large supply of\r\nammunition fell to the victorious Arabs. Success inflamed their ardour\r\nto the point of madness. The attack of the towns was pressed with\r\nredoubled vigour. The garrison of Sinkat, 800 strong, sallied out\r\nand attempted to fight their way to Suakin. The garrison of Tokar\r\nsurrendered. Both were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe evil was done. The slaughter was complete. Yet the British\r\nGovernment resolved to add to it. The garrisons they had refused to\r\nrescue they now determined to avenge. In spite of their philanthropic\r\nprofessions, and in spite of the advice of General Gordon, who felt\r\nthat his position at Khartoum would be still further compromised by\r\noperations on his only line of retreat [Sir E. Baring to Earl Granville,\r\nCairo, February 23.], a considerable military expedition consisting of\r\none cavalry and two infantry brigades, was sent to Suakin. The command\r\nwas entrusted to General Graham. Troops were hurriedly concentrated.\r\nThe 10th Hussars, returning from India, were stopped and mounted on the\r\nhorses of the gendarmerie. With admirable celerity the force took the\r\nfield. Within a month of the defeat at Teb they engaged the enemy almost\r\non the very scene of the disaster. On the 4th of March they slew 3,000\r\nHadendoa and drove the rest in disorder from the ground. Four weeks\r\nlater a second action was fought at Tamai. Again the success of the\r\nBritish troops was complete; again the slaughter of the Arabs was\r\nenormous. But neither victory was bloodless. El Teb cost 24 officers and\r\n168 men; Tamai, 13 officers and 208 men. The effect of these operations\r\nwas the dispersal of Osman Digna's gathering. That astute man, not for\r\nthe first or last time, made a good retreat.\r\n\r\nTen thousand men had thus been killed in the space of three months in\r\nthe Eastern Soudan. By the discipline of their armies the Government\r\nwere triumphant. The tribes of the Red Sea shore cowered before them.\r\nBut as they fought without reason, so they conquered without profit.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Gordon had been finally refused the assistance of Zubehr\r\nPasha, it was evident that the rescue of the garrisons was impossible.\r\nThe General had been sent as the last hope. Rightly or wrongly, his\r\nrecommendations were ignored. His mission was an admitted failure. After\r\nthat the only question was how to bring him away as quickly as possible.\r\nIt was certain that he would not come willingly. Force was necessary.\r\nYet it was difficult to know how to apply it. After the victories in the\r\nEastern Soudan the opportunity presented itself. The road was open. The\r\nlocal tribes were crushed. Berber had not then fallen. The Mahdi was\r\nhimself still on the road from El Obeid to Khartoum. Sir Evelyn Baring\r\nsaw the chance. He did not then occupy the formidable and imposing\r\nposition in Egyptian politics that he has since attained. But with\r\nall his influence he urged the despatch of a small flying column to\r\nKhartoum. His idea was simple. One thousand or twelve hundred men were\r\nto mount on camels and ride thither via Berber. Those who fell ill or\r\nwhose camels broke down would have to take their chance by the\r\nroadside. The plan, however, broke down in the military detail. Only one\r\nhonourable course remained--a regular expedition. This the British Agent\r\nat once began to urge. This the Government obstinately refused to admit;\r\nand meanwhile time was passing.\r\n\r\nThe situation at Khartoum became grave even before the breach between\r\nGeneral Gordon and Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet was complete. While the\r\nBritish Government was indulging in vengeful operations in the Eastern\r\nSoudan, the Mahdi advanced slowly but steadily upon the town with a\r\nfollowing variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men. On\r\nthe 7th of March Colonel Stewart telegraphed from Khartoum: 'The Mahdi\r\nhas attempted to raise the people of Shendi by an emissary.... We may be\r\ncut off;' [Lieut.-Colonel Stewart to Sir E. Baring, March 7, 1884.] and\r\non the 11th Gordon himself reported: 'The rebels are four hours distant\r\non the Blue Nile.' [Major-General Gordon to Sir E. Baring, March 11,\r\n1884.] Thereafter no more telegrams came, for on the 15th the wire was\r\ncut between Shendi and Berber, and the blockade had commenced.\r\n\r\nThe long and glorious defence of the town of Khartoum will always\r\nfascinate attention. That one man, a European among Africans, a\r\nChristian among Mohammedans, should by his genius have inspired the\r\nefforts of 7,000 soldiers of inferior race, and by his courage have\r\nsustained the hearts of 30,000 inhabitants of notorious timidity, and\r\nwith such materials and encumbrances have offered a vigorous resistance\r\nto the increasing attacks of an enemy who, though cruel, would yet\r\naccept surrender, during a period of 317 days, is an event perhaps\r\nwithout parallel in history. But it may safely be predicted that no one\r\nwill ever write an account which will compare in interest or in detail\r\nwith that set forth by the man himself in the famous. 'Journals at\r\nKhartoum.'\r\n\r\nThe brief account has delighted thousands of readers in Europe and\r\nAmerica. Perhaps it is because he is careless of the sympathy of men\r\nthat Charles Gordon so readily wins it. Before the first of the six\r\nparts into which the Journals were divided is finished, the reader has\r\nbeen won. Henceforth he sees the world through Gordon's eyes. With\r\nhim he scoffs at the diplomatists; despises the Government; becomes\r\nimpatient--unreasonably, perhaps--with a certain Major Kitchener in the\r\nIntelligence Branch, whose information miscarried or was not despatched;\r\nis wearied by the impracticable Shaiggia Irregulars; takes interest in\r\nthe turkey-cock and his harem of four wives; laughs at the 'black\r\nsluts' seeing their faces for the first time in the mirror. With him he\r\ntrembles for the fate of the 'poor little beast,' the Husseinyeh, when\r\nshe drifts stern foremost on the shoal, 'a penny steamer under cannon\r\nfire'; day after day he gazes through the General's powerful telescope\r\nfrom the palace roof down the long brown reaches of the river towards\r\nthe rocks of the Shabluka Gorge, and longs for some sign of the\r\nrelieving steamers; and when the end of the account is reached, no\r\nman of British birth can read the last words, 'Now mark this, if the\r\nExpeditionary Force--and I ask for no more than two hundred men--does\r\nnot come within ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for\r\nthe honour of our country. Good-bye,' without being thrilled with vain\r\nregrets and futile resolutions. And then the account stops short. Nor\r\nwill the silence ever be broken. The sixth instalment of the Journals\r\nwas despatched on the 14th of December; and when it is finished the\r\nreader, separated suddenly from the pleasant companionship, experiences\r\na feeling of loss and annoyance. Imagination, long supported, is brushed\r\naside by stern reality. Henceforward Gordon's perils were unrecorded.\r\n\r\nI would select one episode only from the Journals as an example of\r\nthe peculiarity and the sternness of Charles Gordon's character--his\r\nbehaviour towards Slatin. This Austrian officer had been Governor of\r\nDarfur with the rank in the Egyptian service of Bey. For four years\r\nhe had struggled vainly against the rebellion. He had fought numerous\r\nengagements with varied success. He had been several times wounded.\r\nThroughout his province and even beyond its limits he bore the\r\nreputation of a brave and capable soldier. The story of his life of\r\nsuffering and adventure, written by himself, is widely known, and he is\r\nthought by those who have read it to be a man of feeling and of\r\nhonour. By those who enjoy his personal acquaintance this belief is\r\nunhesitatingly confirmed. He had, however, committed an act which\r\ndeprived him of Gordon's sympathy and respect. During the fighting in\r\nDarfur, after several defeats, his Mohammedan soldiers were discouraged\r\nand attributed their evil fortune to the fact that their commander was\r\nan infidel under the curse of the Almighty. Slatin therefore proclaimed\r\nhimself a follower of the Prophet, and outwardly at least adopted the\r\nfaith of Islam. The troops, delighted at his conversion and cheered by\r\nthe hope of success, renewed their efforts, and the resistance of the\r\nGovernor of Darfur was prolonged. The end, however, was deferred,\r\nnot averted. After the destruction of General Hicks's army Slatin was\r\ncompelled to surrender to the Dervishes. The religion he had assumed\r\nto secure victory he observed to escape death. The Arab leaders, who\r\nadmired his courage, treated him at first with respect and kindness, and\r\nhe was conducted to the Mahdi in his encampment before Khartoum. There\r\nduring the siege he remained, closely watched but not imprisoned.\r\nThence he wrote letters to Gordon explaining his surrender, excusing his\r\napostacy, and begging that he might be allowed--not even assisted--to\r\nescape to Khartoum. The letters are extant, and scarcely anyone who\r\nreads them, reflecting on the twelve years of danger and degradation\r\nthat lay before this man, will refuse their compassion.\r\n\r\nGordon was inflexible. Before the arrival of the letters his allusions\r\nto Slatin are contemptuous: 'One cannot help being amused at the Mahdi\r\ncarrying all the Europeans about with him--nuns, priests, Greeks,\r\nAustrian officers--what a medley, a regular Etat-Major!' [JOURNALS AT\r\nKHARTOUM.] He is suspicious of the circumstances of his surrender. 'The\r\nGreek... says Slatin had 4,000 ardebs of dura, 1,500 cows, and plenty\r\nof ammunition: he has been given eight horses by the Mahdi.' He will\r\nnot vouch for such a man; but he adds, with characteristic justice, 'all\r\nthis information must be taken with reserve.'\r\n\r\nAt length the letters came. At the peril of his life, when ordered to\r\nwrite and demand the surrender of the town, Slatin substituted an appeal\r\nto Gordon to countenance his escape. This is the uncompromising minute\r\nin the Journals: 'Oct. 16. The letters of Slatin have arrived. I have no\r\nremarks to make on them, and cannot make out why he wrote them.' In the\r\nafternoon, indeed, he betrays some pity; but it is the pity of a man\r\nfor a mouse. 'He is evidently not a Spartan... he will want some\r\nquarantine... one feels sorry for him.' The next day he is again\r\ninexorable, and gives his reasons clearly. 'I shall have nothing to do\r\nwith Slatin's coming here to stay, unless he has the Mahdi's positive\r\nleave, which he is not likely to get; his doing so would be the breaking\r\nof his parole which should be as sacred when given to the Mahdi as\r\nto any other power, and it would jeopardise the safety of all these\r\nEuropeans, prisoners with Mahdi.'\r\n\r\nSlatin's position, it should be observed, was not that of an officer\r\nreleased on parole, but of a prisoner of war in durance in the enemy's\r\ncamp. In such circumstances he was clearly entitled to escape at his\r\nown proper risk. If his captors gave him the chance, they had only\r\nthemselves to blame. His position was not dissimilar from that of the\r\nblack soldiers who had been captured by the Dervishes and were now made\r\nto serve against the Government. These deserted to Khartoum daily, and\r\nthe General fully acquiesced in their doing so. As to Slatin's escape\r\naffecting the treatment of the other European prisoners, it must be\r\nobserved that when at various times escapes were effected from Omdurman,\r\nand ultimately when Slatin himself escaped, no ill-treatment was\r\ninflicted on the rest of the prisoners; and even had such ill-treatment\r\nbeen the certain consequence of an escape, that need not have debarred\r\na man, according to the customs of war, from attempting to regain his\r\nliberty. Nothing but his free and formal promise, obtained in return\r\nfor favours received, can alienate that right. If the Mahdi chose to\r\nslaughter the remaining prisoners, the responsibility rested with the\r\nMahdi.\r\n\r\nSlatin was, however, in no position to argue his case. His\r\ncorrespondence with Gordon was discovered. For some days his life hung\r\non a thread. For several months he was heavily chained and fed on a\r\ndaily handful of uncooked doura, such as is given to horses and mules.\r\nTidings of these things were carried to Gordon. 'Slatin,' he observes\r\nicily, 'is still in chains.' He never doubted the righteousness of the\r\ncourse he had adopted, never for an instant. But few will deny that\r\nthere were strong arguments on both sides. Many will assert that they\r\nwere nicely balanced. Gordon must have weighed them carefully. He never\r\nwavered. Yet he needed Slatin. He was alone. He had no one in whose\r\nmilitary capacity he could put the slightest confidence. Again and again\r\nin the Journals he expresses his want of trustworthy subordinates. He\r\ncould not be everywhere, he said. 'Nearly every order has to be repeated\r\ntwo or three times. I am weary of my life.' 'What one has felt so much\r\nhere is the want of men like Gessi, or Messadaglia, or Slatin, but I\r\nhave no one to whom I could entrust expeditions.....'\r\n\r\nThis was the man who would have employed Zubehr and bowed to expediency.\r\nBut Zubehr had never 'denied his Lord.'\r\n\r\nThe actual defence of Khartoum is within the province of the Journals,\r\nnor shall I attempt a chronological account. After the 10th of\r\nSeptember, when General Gordon sent Colonel Stewart and Messrs. Power\r\nand Herbin down the river in the ill-fated Abbas steamer, he was\r\naltogether alone. Many men have bowed to the weight of responsibility.\r\nGordon's responsibility was undivided. There was no one to whom he could\r\ntalk as an equal. There was no one to whom he could--as to a trusty\r\nsubordinate--reveal his doubts. To some minds the exercise of power\r\nis pleasant, but few sensations are more painful than responsibility\r\nwithout control. The General could not supervise the defence. The\r\nofficers robbed the soldiers of their rations. The sentries slumbered at\r\ntheir posts. The townspeople bewailed their misfortunes, and all ranks\r\nand classes intrigued with the enemy in the hope of securing safety\r\nwhen the town should fall. Frequent efforts were made to stir up the\r\ninhabitants or sap their confidence. Spies of all kinds pervaded the\r\ntown. The Egyptian Pashas, despairing, meditated treason. Once an\r\nattempt was made to fire the magazine. Once no less than eighty thousand\r\nardebs of grain was stolen from the arsenal. From time to time the\r\nrestless and ceaseless activity of the commander might discover some\r\nplot and arrest the conspirators; or, checking some account, might\r\ndetect some robbery; but he was fully aware that what he found out\r\nwas scarcely a tithe of what he could not hope to know. The Egyptian\r\nofficers were untrustworthy. Yet he had to trust them. The inhabitants\r\nwere thoroughly broken by war, and many were disloyal. He had to feed\r\nand inspirit them. The town itself was scarcely defensible. It must\r\nbe defended to the end. From the flat roof of his palace his telescope\r\ncommanded a view of the forts and lines. Here he would spend the greater\r\npart of each day, scrutinising the defences and the surrounding country\r\nwith his powerful glass. When he observed that the sentries on the forts\r\nhad left their posts, he would send over to have them flogged and\r\ntheir superiors punished. When his 'penny steamers' engaged the Dervish\r\nbatteries he would watch, 'on tenter-hooks,' a combat which might be\r\nfatal to the defence, but which, since he could not direct it, must be\r\nleft to officers by turns timid and reckless: and in the dark hours of\r\nthe night he could not even watch. The Journals, the only receptacle of\r\nhis confidences, display the bitterness of his sufferings no less than\r\nthe greatness of his character. 'There is no contagion,' he writes,\r\n'equal to that of fear. I have been rendered furious when from anxiety I\r\ncould not eat, I would find those at the same table were in like manner\r\naffected.'\r\n\r\nTo the military anxieties was added every kind of worry which may\r\nweary a man's soul. The women clamoured for bread. The townsfolk heaped\r\nreproaches upon him. The quarrel with the British Government had cut\r\nhim very deeply. The belief that he was abandoned and discredited, that\r\nhistory would make light of his efforts, would perhaps never know of\r\nthem, filled his mind with a sense of wrong and injustice which preyed\r\nupon his spirits. The miseries of the townsfolk wrung his noble,\r\ngenerous heart. The utter loneliness depressed him. And over all lay the\r\nshadow of uncertainty. To the very end the possibility that 'all might\r\nbe well' mocked him with false hopes. The first light of any morning\r\nmight reveal the longed-for steamers of relief and the uniforms of\r\nBritish soldiers. He was denied even the numbing anaesthetic of despair.\r\n\r\nYet he was sustained by two great moral and mental stimulants: his\r\nhonour as a man, his faith as a Christian. The first had put all courses\r\nwhich he did not think right once and for all out of the question, and\r\nso allayed many doubts and prevented many vain regrets. But the second\r\nwas the real source of his strength. He was sure that beyond this\r\nhazardous existence, with all its wrongs and inequalities, another life\r\nawaited him--a life which, if he had been faithful and true here\r\nupon earth, would afford him greater faculties for good and wider\r\nopportunities for their use. 'Look at me now,' he once said to a\r\nfellow-traveller, 'with small armies to command and no cities to govern.\r\nI hope that death will set me free from pain, and that great armies\r\nwill be given me, and that I shall have vast cities under my command.'\r\n[Lieut.-Colonel N. Newham Davis, 'Some Gordon Reminiscences,' published\r\nin THE MAN OF THE WORLD newspaper, December 14, 1898.] Such was his\r\nbright hope of immortality.\r\n\r\nAs the severity of military operations increases, so also must the\r\nsternness of discipline. The zeal of the soldiers, their warlike\r\ninstincts, and the interests and excitements of war may ensure obedience\r\nof orders and the cheerful endurance of perils and hardships during a\r\nshort and prosperous campaign. But when fortune is dubious or adverse;\r\nwhen retreats as well as advances are necessary; when supplies fail,\r\narrangements miscarry, and disasters impend, and when the struggle\r\nis protracted, men can only be persuaded to accept evil things by the\r\nlively realisation of the fact that greater terrors await their refusal.\r\nThe ugly truth is revealed that fear is the foundation of obedience. It\r\nis certain that the influence of General Gordon upon the garrison and\r\ntownspeople of Khartoum owed its greatest strength to that sinister\r\nelement. 'It is quite painful,' he writes in his Journals in September,\r\n'to see men tremble so, when they come and see me, that they cannot\r\nhold the match to their cigarette.' Yet he employed all other methods\r\nof inspiring their efforts. As the winter drew on, the sufferings of the\r\nbesieged increased and their faith in their commander and his promises\r\nof relief diminished. To preserve their hopes--and, by their hopes,\r\ntheir courage and loyalty--was beyond the power of man. But what a great\r\nman in the utmost exercise of his faculties and authority might do,\r\nGordon did.\r\n\r\nHis extraordinary spirit never burned more brightly than in these last,\r\ngloomy days. The money to pay the troops was exhausted. He issued notes,\r\nsigning them with his own name. The citizens groaned under the triple\r\nscourge of scarcity, disease, and war. He ordered the bands to play\r\nmerrily and discharged rockets. It was said that they were abandoned,\r\nthat help would never come, that the expedition was a myth--the lie of a\r\nGeneral who was disavowed by his Government. Forthwith he placarded\r\nthe walls with the news of victories and of the advance of a triumphant\r\nBritish army; or hired all the best houses by the river's bank for the\r\naccommodation of the officers of the relieving force. A Dervish shell\r\ncrashed through his palace. He ordered the date of its arrival to be\r\ninscribed above the hole. For those who served him faithfully he struck\r\nmedals and presented them with pomp and circumstance. Others less\r\nlaudable he shot. And by all these means and expedients the defence of\r\nthe city was prolonged through the summer, autumn, and winter of 1884\r\nand on into the year 1885.\r\n\r\nAll this time the public anxiety in England had been steadily growing.\r\nIf Gordon was abandoned, he was by no means forgotten. As his mission\r\nhad been followed with intense interest throughout the whole country,\r\nso its failure had caused general despondency. Disappointment soon gave\r\nplace to alarm. The subject of the personal safety of the distinguished\r\nenvoy was first raised in the House of Commons on the 16th of March by\r\nLord Randolph Churchill. Availing himself of the opportunities provided\r\nby Supply, he criticised the vacillating policy of the Government,\r\ntheir purposeless slaughter in the Eastern Soudan, and their failure to\r\nestablish the Suakin-Berber route. He proceeded to draw attention to the\r\nperilous position of General Gordon at Khartoum.\r\n\r\n'Colonel Coetlogon has stated that Khartoum may be easily captured; we\r\nknow that General Gordon is surrounded by hostile tribes and cut off\r\nfrom communications with Cairo and London; and under these circumstances\r\nthe House has a right to ask her Majesty's Government whether they\r\nare going to do anything to relieve him. Are they going to remain\r\nindifferent to the fate of the one man on whom they have counted to\r\nextricate them from their dilemmas, to leave him to shift for himself,\r\nand not make a single effort on his behalf?' [HANSARD'S PARLIAMENTARY\r\nDEBATES, March 16, 1884.]\r\n\r\nThe Government remained impassive. Lord E. Fitzmaurice made some sort of\r\nreply, and there were Ministerial cheers. But the subject, Once raised,\r\nwas not allowed to drop. Inspired and animated by the earnest energy\r\nof a young man, the Opposition were continually growing stronger. The\r\nconduct of Egyptian affairs afforded ample opportunity for criticism and\r\nattack. All through the summer months and almost every night Ministers\r\nwere invited to declare whether they would rescue their envoy or\r\nleave him to his fate. Mr. Gladstone returned evasive answers. The\r\nConservative Press took the cue. The agitation became intense. Even\r\namong the supporters of the Government there was dissatisfaction. But\r\nthe Prime Minister was obdurate and unflinching. At length, at the end\r\nof the Session, the whole matter was brought forward in the gravest\r\nand most formal way by the moving of a vote of censure. The debate that\r\nfollowed Sir Michael Hicks Beach's motion was long and acrimonious. Mr.\r\nGladstone's speech only increased the disquietude of his followers and\r\nthe fury of the Opposition. Mr. Forster openly declared his disagreement\r\nwith his leader; and although Lord Hartington in winding up the debate\r\nthrew out some hopes of an expedition in the autumn, the Government\r\nmajority fell on the division to twenty-eight. And after the prorogation\r\nthe controversy was carried on with undiminished vigour outside the\r\nwalls of Parliament, and the clamour in the country grew louder and\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to look upon Mr. Gladstone's conduct in the matter of the\r\nrelief of Gordon as dictated by benevolent weakness. History may take\r\nanother view. Strong and stubborn as was the character of the General,\r\nthat of the Minister was its equal. If Gordon was the better man,\r\nGladstone was incomparably the greater. It was easy for the First\r\nMinister of the Crown to despatch an expedition against savages. He was\r\naccustomed to the exercise of power. Compared with the resources of\r\nthe Empire, the enterprise was insignificant. Few men have feared\r\nresponsibility less than Gladstone. On the other hand, the expressed\r\ndesire of the nation was a force to which he had always bowed--to which,\r\nindeed, he owed his political existence. Yet, in spite of the growing\r\nagitation throughout the land, he remained stern and silent. Most men\r\ndo what is right, or what they persuade themselves is right; nor is\r\nit difficult to believe that Mr. Gladstone did not feel justified in\r\ninvolving the nation in operations in the heart of the Soudan for the\r\npurpose, not of saving the life of the envoy--for Gordon had but to\r\nembark on his steamers and come home--but simply in order to vindicate\r\nthe personal honour of a man. And it is possible that a feeling of\r\nresentment against the officer whose intractable nature was bringing\r\nsuch odium upon the Government may have coloured his resolution with a\r\ndarker tinge.\r\n\r\nBut for all his power and influence he was forced to give way. The\r\nGovernment which had long ignored the call of honour abroad, was driven\r\nto the Soudan by the cries of shame at home. Lord Hartington, at that\r\ntime Secretary of State for War, must be dissociated from the general\r\ncensure which his principal colleagues have incurred. He was the first\r\nto recognise the obligation which lay upon the Cabinet, and through the\r\nCabinet upon the nation, and it was to his influence that the despatch\r\nof the relieving expedition was mainly due. The Commander-in-Chief and\r\nthe Adjutant-General, who were fully alive to the critical position at\r\nKhartoum, added their recommendations. But even at the last moment Mr.\r\nGladstone was induced to sanction the advance only by the belief that\r\nthe scale of the operations would be small, and that only a single\r\nbrigade would be necessary. The decision was taken forthwith by the\r\nMinistry and announced to the nation. The Adjutant-General, however,\r\nasked for a very different force from what the Government had\r\nanticipated, and the single brigade was expanded into an expedition of\r\nten thousand men, selected from the whole army.\r\n\r\nTo reverse the decision was now, however, impossible, and the 'Gordon\r\nRelief Expedition' began. The commander to whom the conduct of the\r\noperations had been entrusted reviewed the situation. He saw himself\r\nconfronted with a task which was easy and safe if it were undertaken at\r\nleisure, and which was doubtful and perilous if begun in haste. All the\r\nfruits of a long and successful career were staked on the result, and\r\nit is scarcely wonderful that he declined to be swift and reckless.\r\nShrewdly estimating the military difficulties, he made his plans for a\r\nmethodical and deliberate advance which would leave nothing to luck,\r\nand which resembles in character that afterwards carried out by Sir\r\nH. Kitchener. He excluded the idea of a wild glorious rush which might\r\nresult in astonishing success or terrible disaster.\r\n\r\nTroops and stores were steadily collected at Wady Halfa and along the\r\nNile. The new Camel Corps, consisting of four regiments, practised their\r\ndrills and evolutions. To pilot the boats up the Cataracts voyageurs\r\nwere brought from Canada. At length, when all preparations were\r\ncomplete, the expedition started. The plan was simple. A strong column\r\nof infantry in boats was to work up the river. In case that should not\r\narrive in time, the Camel Corps was to strike across the Bayuda Desert\r\nfrom Korti to Metemma. Having arrived there, a small detachment was\r\nto be thrown into Khartoum by Gordon's steamers to sustain the defence\r\nuntil the arrival of the main body in March or even April of 1885, when\r\nthe town could be regularly relieved.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic character of the enterprise and its picturesque and\r\noriginal features fascinated the nation, and the advance was watched\r\nwith breathless interest. The fortunes of the River Column have been\r\ngraphically described by one who played no small part in their attempt.\r\n'The Campaign of the Cataracts' [By Sir William Butler] is a record of\r\nhard and unceasing toil. Day after day the long lines of soldiers hauled\r\non the tow-ropes or pulled at the oars of the broad-bottomed boats.\r\nNight after night they camped on the banks amid the grim desolation of\r\nthe Monassir Desert. Yet their monotonous labours were encouraged by the\r\nknowledge that as soon as the bend of the river at Abu Hamed was reached\r\nthe strong north wind would carry them swiftly to Khartoum. And it\r\nseemed a strange and bitter irony that the order to turn back and the\r\nnews that all had been in vain was announced to the troops on the very\r\nday when they had cleared the cataracts and were moving forward at five\r\ntimes their former speed.\r\n\r\nThe Desert Column started from Korti on the 30th of December. Their\r\nstrength did not exceed 1,100 officers and men, but they were the flower\r\nof the army. Dropping their communications, they set forth along the\r\ncaravan route towards Metemma. The knowledge which we have since gained\r\nof the resources of the Mahdists enables the peril of their desperate\r\nventure to be fully appreciated. Although the Dervishes were neither so\r\nwell armed nor trained as at a later date, they were nearly as numerous\r\nand equally devoid of fear. Their tactics were more in accordance with\r\nmodern conditions: their fanaticism was at its height. The British\r\nforce, on the other hand, was equipped with weapons scarcely comparable\r\nwith those employed in the concluding campaigns. Instead of the powerful\r\nLee-Metford rifle, with its smokeless powder, its magazine action, and\r\nits absence of recoil, they were armed with the Martini-Henry, which\r\npossessed none of these advantages. In place of the deadly Maxim there\r\nwas the Gardner gun--the very gun that jammed at Tamai, and that jammed\r\nagain at Abu Klea. The artillery was also in every respect inferior\r\nto that now in general use. Besides all this, the principles of\r\nfire-discipline and of scientific musketry were new, little understood,\r\nand hardly admitted. Nevertheless, the Camel Corps went boldly forward,\r\nand engaged an enemy whose destruction ultimately required the strength\r\nof a better-armed and better-instructed army twelve times as strong.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of January they reached Gakdul Wells. A hundred miles of\r\ntheir march was accomplished. But they were now delayed by the necessity\r\nof escorting a second column of supplies to Gakdul, and after that until\r\nthe arrival of reinforcements which raised their strength to 1,800 of\r\nall ranks. The interval was employed in building two small forts and\r\nestablishing an advanced depot; nor was it until the 13th that the march\r\nwas resumed. The number of camels was not sufficient for the necessities\r\nof the transport. The food of the camels was too poor for the work they\r\nhad to perform. By the 16th, however, they had made fifty miles,\r\nand approached the wells of Abu Klea. Here their further advance was\r\ndisputed by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe news of the advance of the Desert Column had been duly reported to\r\nthe Mahdi and his Arab generals. A small party of English, it was said,\r\nwith camels and some cavalry, were coming swiftly to the rescue of the\r\naccursed city. Their numbers were few, scarce 2,000 men. How should they\r\nhope to prevail against 'the expected Mahdi' and the conquering Ansar\r\nwho had destroyed Hicks? They were mad; yet they should die; not one\r\nshould escape. The delay in the advance offered ample opportunity.\r\nA great force of Arabs was concentrated. Slatin relates how several\r\nthousand men under important Emirs were detached from the army before\r\nKhartoum and marched northward eager for the slaughter of 'the enemies\r\nof God.' At Metemma the main strength of the Jaalin tribe was collected.\r\nWith the reinforcements from Omdurman the total force of the Arabs\r\nactually at hand was not less than 10,000, and behind were many\r\nthousands more. They permitted the little column to advance until their\r\nretreat, if defeated, was impossible, and then, confident of victory,\r\noffered battle near the wells of Abu Klea.\r\n\r\nThe Camel Corps remained halted during the morning of the 16th, and\r\nbuilt a small fort, in which they placed their reserve of stores, and\r\nmade some arrangement for the reception of wounded. At one o'clock they\r\nmoved leisurely forward, passed through the rocky defile which led into\r\nthe valley of Abu Klea and bivouacked. Early the next morning the force\r\nmoved out in square formation and advanced upon the enemy. The most\r\nsavage and bloody action ever fought in the Soudan by British troops\r\nfollowed. Notwithstanding the numbers and the valour of the Arabs, that\r\nthey penetrated the square, and that they inflicted on the troops a\r\nloss of nine officers and sixty-five men killed and nine officers and\r\neighty-five men wounded--10 percent of the entire force--they were\r\ndriven from the field with great slaughter, and the Desert Column camped\r\nat the wells.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 18th they rested, placed their wounded in the\r\nsmall fort they had built, and buried their dead. In the afternoon they\r\ncontinued their advance, marched all through the night, and, having\r\ncovered twenty-three miles, halted exhausted, almost within sight of the\r\nriver, at daylight on the 19th. Meanwhile the enemy had again collected\r\nin great strength, and an effective rifle fire was opened on the column.\r\nSir Herbert Stewart received the wound of which a few weeks later he\r\ndied. The command devolved upon Sir Charles Wilson. The position was\r\ndesperate. Water was running short. The Nile was only four miles away;\r\nbut the column were impeded by their wounded and stores, and between\r\nthe river and the thirsty men lay the Dervish army, infuriated by their\r\nlosses and fully aware of the sore straits to which their astonishing\r\nenemy was now reduced.\r\n\r\nIt now became necessary to divide the small force. Some must remain to\r\nguard the baggage and the wounded; the others must fight their way to\r\nthe water. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 19th, 900 men left\r\nthe hastily made zeriba and marched towards the river. Without their\r\ncamels or those of the transport they appeared insignificant, a mere\r\nspeck on the broad plain of Metemma. The Dervishes hastened to clinch\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nThe square advances slowly and painfully over the stony ground, with\r\nfrequent jerky halts to preserve order and to pick up the wounded.\r\nLittle puffs of white smoke dot the distant sandhills. Here and there a\r\ngaudy flag waves defiantly. In front the green tops of the palm-trees by\r\nthe Nile tantalise but stimulate the soldiers. On the left the great mud\r\nlabyrinth of Metemma stretches indefinitely. Suddenly the firing stops.\r\nThe low scrub in front is alive with the swarming figures of the enemy.\r\nAll the flags dance forward together. Ragged white figures spring up\r\nin hundreds. Emirs on horses appear as if by magic. Everywhere are\r\nmen running swiftly forward, waving their spears and calling upon the\r\nProphet of God to speed their enterprise. The square halts. The weary\r\nmen begin to fire with thoughtful care, The Dervishes drop thickly. On\r\nthen, children of the desert! you are so many, they are so few. They are\r\nworn with fatigue and their throats are parched. You have drunk deeply\r\nof the Nile. One rush will trample the accursed under the feet of the\r\nfaithful. The charge continues. A bugle sounds in the waiting square.\r\nThe firing stops. What is this? They lose heart. Their ammunition is\r\nexhausted. On, then, and make an end. Again the smoke ripples along the\r\nline of bayonets and fire is re-opened, this time at closer range and\r\nwith far greater effect. The stubborn grandeur of the British soldier is\r\ndisplayed by desperate circumstances. The men shoot to hit. The attack\r\ncrumples. The Emirs--horse and man--collapse. The others turn and\r\nwalk--for they will not run--sullenly back towards the town. The square\r\nstarts forward. The road to the river is open. With dusk the water is\r\nreached, and never have victors gained a more longed-for prize. The Nile\r\nis won. Gordon remains.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Wilson, having collected his force, remained three days by\r\nthe bank of the Nile before attempting any further advance on Khartoum.\r\nHe has explained why this delay was necessary, to the satisfaction of\r\nmost military critics. Nor is it easy to believe that men who had made\r\nsuch splendid efforts would have willingly lost a single moment. On the\r\nfourth day he embarked on two of Gordon's steamers, which awaited the\r\nrelieving column, and taking with him twenty British soldiers and a few\r\nblue-jackets set forth towards the Shabluka Gorge and the town that lay\r\nbeyond. On the 27th of January the rescuers came in sight of Khartoum\r\nand under the fire of the enemy. Many of their perilous adventures seem\r\nto belong to romance rather than to reality: the tiny gimcrack boats\r\nstruggling with the strong stream of the cataract, running the gauntlet\r\nof the Arab guns, dropping disconsolately down the river with their\r\nterrible news, or wrecked and stranded on the sandbank; Stuart-Wortley\r\nrowing to the camp before Metemma for help; Beresford starting in the\r\nremaining steamer; the bursting of the boiler by a Dervish shell;\r\nBenbow mending it in a single day; Wilson's rescue and the return to\r\nthe entrenchment at Gubat. But the scene that appeals to the imagination\r\nabove all the others is that where with both banks ablaze with musketry\r\nand artillery, the black smoke pouring through the shot-holes in the\r\nfunnels, the water rising in spurts from the bullets, the men who had\r\ncome so far and braved so much stared at the palace roof and, seeing no\r\nflag flying, knew that all was over and that they had come too late.\r\n\r\nThe news of the Dervish defeats at Abu Klea and Abu Kru impelled the\r\nMahdi to a desperate venture. The English were but 120 miles away. They\r\nwere few, but victorious. It was difficult to say what force could stop\r\nsuch men. In spite of the wrath of the true God and the valour of Islam\r\nthey might prevail. The Mahdi depended on success for existence. The\r\ntremendous forces of fanaticism are exerted only in a forward direction.\r\nRetreat meant ruin. All must be staked on an immediate assault. And,\r\nbesides, the moment was ripe. Thus the Arab chiefs reasoned, and wisely\r\nresolved to be reckless. Thus the night of the 25th of January arrived.\r\n\r\nThe band played as usual in the evening. Gradually the shadows fell and\r\nit became dark. The hungry inhabitants betook themselves to bed. The\r\nanxious but indomitable commander knew that the crisis impended, and\r\nknew also that he was powerless to avert it. Perhaps he slept, satisfied\r\nthat he had done his duty; and in the silence of the night the savage\r\nenemy crawled stealthily towards the town. The weary and disheartened\r\nsentinels, weakened by famine and tired of war, maintained a doubtful\r\nvigilance along the ramparts. The subsiding waters of the river had\r\nleft a bare gap between the White Nile and the wall. Perhaps there was\r\ntreachery besides. On a sudden the loud explosion of musketry broke\r\nthe stillness of the night and the slumbers of the people; and with\r\na continual shouting thousands of Dervishes swarmed through the\r\nunprotected space and entered Khartoum.\r\n\r\nOne mob of assailants made their way to the palace. Gordon came out to\r\nmeet them. The whole courtyard was filled with wild, harlequin figures\r\nand sharp, glittering blades. He attempted a parley. 'Where is your\r\nmaster, the Mahdi?' He knew his influence over native races. Perhaps\r\nhe hoped to save the lives of some of the inhabitants. Perhaps in that\r\nsupreme moment imagination flashed another picture before his eyes; and\r\nhe saw himself confronted with the false prophet of a false religion,\r\nconfronted with the European prisoners who had 'denied their Lord,'\r\noffered the choice of death or the Koran; saw himself facing that savage\r\ncircle with a fanaticism equal to, and a courage greater than, their\r\nown; marching in all the pride of faith 'and with retorted scorn' to a\r\nmartyr's death.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be. Mad with the joy of victory and religious frenzy,\r\nthey rushed upon him and, while he disdained even to fire his revolver,\r\nstabbed him in many places. The body fell down the steps and lay--a\r\ntwisted heap--at the foot. There it was decapitated. The head was\r\ncarried to the Mahdi. The trunk was stabbed again and again by the\r\ninfuriated creatures, till nothing but a shapeless bundle of torn flesh\r\nand bloody rags remained of what had been a great and famous man and the\r\nenvoy of her Britannic Majesty. The blood soaked into the ground, and\r\nleft a dark stain which was not immediately effaced. Slatin mentions\r\nthat the Arabs used often to visit the place. Ohrwalder went himself,\r\nand more than six weeks after the capture of the town, saw 'black spots'\r\nupon the steps. But they have all since been obliterated.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly, is the story of the fall of Khartoum and of the death of\r\nGordon. The fact that the two steamers arrived only two days after the\r\ncapture of the town has given colour to the belief that, but for the\r\nthree days' delay at Metemma, the catastrophe might have been averted.\r\nThis view appears incorrect. The Arabs had long held Khartoum at their\r\nmercy. They hoped, indeed, to compel its surrender by famine and to\r\navoid an assault, which after their experience at El Obeid they knew\r\nmust cost them dear. Gordon has stated in his Journals that the town\r\nbecame defenceless by the middle of December. The arrival of twenty\r\nBritish soldiers and a few officers could not have materially affected\r\nthe situation--could only, in fact, have increased the loss. Yet nearly\r\neveryone who reads the tale will wish--in spite of reason--that some\r\nhelp, however little, had reached the lonely man; that before the\r\ndarkness fell he had grasped an English hand, and learned that his\r\ncountrymen had not abandoned him, had not forgotten--would never forget.\r\n\r\nIt may not be possible as yet to fix the exact place which Charles\r\nGordon will occupy in English history. It is certainly a high one.\r\nWhether he will rank as a commander with Peterborough, Wolfe, and Olive,\r\nthose who come after us must decide. We may, however, assert that he was\r\na man of stainless honour and enduring courage, who in varied capacities\r\ndisplayed a fertile and abundant genius. He was careless alike of the\r\nhonours and comforts of the world, and looked forward with firm faith\r\nto the rewards of a future state. The severity of his religion did not\r\nimpair the amiability of his character. The uncertainty of his moods may\r\nhave frequently affected the soundness of his opinions, but not often\r\nthe justice of his actions. Gordon's statue, set up in the indignant\r\ngrief of the nation in the space which is appropriated to the monuments\r\nof Great Captains by sea and land, claims the attention of the\r\npasser-by, not only because it is comparatively new. The figure, its\r\npose, and its story are familiar even to the poorest citizens of London\r\nand to people from all parts of the United Kingdom. Serene amid the\r\nnoise of the traffic, as formerly in that of the battle, the famous\r\nGeneral seems still, with bowed head and thoughtful countenance, to\r\nrevolve the problems of the dark Soudan and, inattentive to the clamour\r\nof men, inquires what is acceptable to God.\r\n\r\nWith the capture of the city and the death of the envoy the reason for\r\nthe expedition disappeared. It remained only to withdraw the troops. The\r\nstores which had been brought across the desert at a terrible cost were\r\nthrown hastily into the Nile. The battered steamers which had waited\r\nso long at Metemma were hurriedly dismantled. The Camel Corps, their\r\nextraordinary efforts futile and their camels killed, marched back on\r\nfoot to Korti. Their retreat was pressed by the exultant enemy. The\r\nRiver Column, whose boats after months of labour had just cleared the\r\nCataracts, and who had gained a success at Kirbekan, were carried\r\nback swiftly by the strong current against which they had hopefully\r\nstruggled. The whole Expeditionary Force--Guards, Highlanders, sailors,\r\nHussars, Indian soldiers, Canadian voyageurs, mules, camels, and\r\nartillery--trooped back forlornly over the desert sands, and behind\r\nthem the rising tide of barbarism followed swiftly, until the whole vast\r\nregion was submerged. For several months the garrison of Kassala under\r\na gallant Egyptian maintained a desperate resistance, but at last famine\r\nforced them to surrender, and they shared the fate of the garrisons\r\nof El Obeid, Darfur, Sobat, Tokar, Sinkat, Sennar, and Khartoum. The\r\nevacuation of the Soudan was thus completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: THE DERVISH EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might seem at first a great advantage that the peoples of the Soudan,\r\ninstead of being a multitude of wild, discordant tribes, should unite of\r\ntheir own accord into one strong community, actuated by a common spirit,\r\nliving under fixed laws, and ruled by a single sovereign. But there\r\nis one form of centralised government which is almost entirely\r\nunprogressive and beyond all other forms costly and tyrannical--the rule\r\nof an army. Such a combination depends, not on the good faith and good\r\nwill of its constituents, but on their discipline and almost mechanical\r\nobedience. Mutual fear, not mutual trust, promotes the co-operation of\r\nits individual members. History records many such dominations, ancient\r\nand modern, civilised or barbaric; and though education and culture\r\nmay modify, they cannot change their predominant characteristics--a\r\ncontinual subordination of justice to expediency, an indifference to\r\nsuffering, a disdain of ethical principles, a laxity of morals, and\r\na complete ignorance of economics. The evil qualities of military\r\nhierarchies are always the same. The results of their rule are\r\nuniversally unfortunate. The degree may vary with time and place, but\r\nthe political supremacy of an army always leads to the formation of\r\na great centralised capital, to the consequent impoverishment of the\r\nprovinces, to the degradation of the peaceful inhabitants through\r\noppression and want, to the ruin of commerce, the decay of learning,\r\nand the ultimate demoralisation even of the military order through\r\noverbearing pride and sensual indulgence.\r\n\r\nOf the military dominations which history records, the Dervish Empire\r\nwas probably the worst. All others have displayed compensating virtues.\r\nA high sense of personal honour has counterbalanced a low standard\r\nof public justice. An ennobling patriotism may partly repair economic\r\nfollies. The miseries of the people are often concealed by the\r\nmagnificence of the army. The laxity of morals is in some degree excused\r\nby the elegance of manners. But the Dervish Empire developed no virtue\r\nexcept courage, a quality more admirable than rare. The poverty of the\r\nland prevented magnificence. The ignorance of its inhabitants excluded\r\nrefinement. The Dervish dominion was born of war, existed by war, and\r\nfell by war. It began on the night of the sack of Khartoum. It ended\r\nabruptly thirteen years later in the battle of Omdurman. Like a\r\nsubsidiary volcano, it was flung up by one convulsion, blazed during the\r\nperiod of disturbance, and was destroyed by the still more violent shock\r\nthat ended the eruption.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Khartoum and the retreat of the British armies the\r\nMahdi became the absolute master of the Soudan. Whatever pleasures he\r\ndesired he could command, and, following the example of the founder of\r\nthe Mohammedan faith, he indulged in what would seem to Western minds\r\ngross excesses. He established an extensive harem for his own peculiar\r\nuse, and immured therein the fairest captives of the war. The conduct of\r\nthe ruler was imitated by his subjects. The presence of women increased\r\nthe vanity of the warriors: and it was not very long before the patched\r\nsmock which had vaunted the holy poverty of the rebels developed into\r\nthe gaudy jibba of the conquerors. Since the unhealthy situation of\r\nKhartoum amid swamps and marshes did not commend itself to the now\r\nluxurious Arabs, the Mahdi began to build on the western bank of the\r\nWhite Nile a new capital, which, from the detached fort which had stood\r\nthere in Egyptian days, was called Omdurman. Among the first buildings\r\nwhich he set his subjects to construct were a mosque for the services of\r\nreligion, an arsenal for the storage of military material, and a house\r\nfor himself. But while he was thus entering at once upon the enjoyments\r\nof supreme power and unbridled lust, the God whom he had served, not\r\nunfaithfully, and who had given him whatever he had asked, required of\r\nMohammed Ahmed his soul; and so all that he had won by his brains and\r\nbravery became of no more account to him.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the month of June, scarcely five months after the\r\ncompletion of his victorious campaigns, the Mahdi fell sick. For a few\r\ndays he did not appear at the mosque. The people were filled with alarm.\r\nThey were reassured by remembering the prophecy that their liberator\r\nshould not perish till he had conquered the earth. Mohammed, however,\r\ngrew worse. Presently those who attended him could doubt no longer that\r\nhe was attacked by typhus fever. The Khalifa Abdullah watched by his\r\ncouch continually. On the sixth day the inhabitants and the soldiers\r\nwere informed of the serious nature of their ruler's illness, and public\r\nprayers were offered by all classes for his recovery. On the seventh\r\nday it was evident that he was dying. All those who had shared his\r\nfortunes--the Khalifas he had appointed, the chief priests of the\r\nreligion he had reformed, the leaders of the armies who had followed him\r\nto victory, and his own family whom he had hallowed--crowded the small\r\nroom. For some hours he lay unconscious or in delirium, but as the end\r\napproached he rallied a little, and, collecting his faculties by a great\r\neffort, declared his faithful follower and friend the Khalifa Abdullah\r\nhis successor, and adjured the rest to show him honour. 'He is of me,\r\nand I am of him; as you have obeyed me, so you should deal with him. May\r\nGod have mercy upon me!' [Slatin, FIRE AND SWORD.] Then he immediately\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nGrief and dismay filled the city. In spite of the emphatic prohibition\r\nby law of all loud lamentations, the sound of 'weeping and wailing arose\r\nfrom almost every house.' The whole people, deprived at once of their\r\nacknowledged sovereign and spiritual guide, were shocked and affrighted.\r\nOnly the Mahdi's wives, if we may credit Slatin, 'rejoiced secretly in\r\ntheir hearts at the death of their husband and master,' and, since they\r\nwere henceforth to be doomed to an enforced and inviolable chastity,\r\nthe cause of their satisfaction is as obscure as its manifestation\r\nwas unnatural. The body of the Mahdi, wrapped in linen, was reverently\r\ninterred in a deep grave dug in the floor of the room in which he had\r\ndied, nor was it disturbed until after the capture of Omdurman by the\r\nBritish forces in 1898, when by the orders of Sir H. Kitchener the\r\nsepulchre was opened and the corpse exhumed.\r\n\r\nThe Khalifa Abdullah had been declared by the Mahdi's latest breath his\r\nsuccessor. He determined to have the choice ratified once for all by the\r\npopular vote. Hurrying to the pulpit in the courtyard of the mosque, he\r\naddressed the assembled multitude in a voice which trembled with intense\r\nexcitement and emotion. His oratory, his reputation as a warrior, and\r\nthe Mahdi's expressed desire aroused the enthusiasm of his hearers,\r\nand the oath of allegiance was at once sworn by thousands. The ceremony\r\ncontinued long after it was dark. With an amazing endurance he harangued\r\ntill past midnight, and when the exhausted Slatin, who hard attended him\r\nthroughout the crisis, lay down upon the ground to sleep, he knew\r\nthat his master's succession was assured; for, says he, 'I heard the\r\npassers-by loud in their praises of the late Mahdi, and assuring each\r\nother of their firm resolve to support his successor.'\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty that Abdullah had obtained must be held, as it had been\r\nwon, by the sword. The passionate agitation which the Mahdi had excited\r\nsurvived him. The whole of the Soudan was in a ferment. The success\r\nwhich had crowned rebellion encouraged rebels. All the turbulent and\r\nfanatical elements were aroused. As the various provinces had been\r\ncleared of the Egyptians, the new Executive had appointed military\r\ngovernors by whom the country was ruled and taxed, subject to the\r\npleasure of Mohammed Ahmed. His death was the signal for a long series\r\nof revolts of all kinds--military, political, and religious. Garrisons\r\nmutinied; Emirs plotted; prophets preached. Nor was the land torn only\r\nby internal struggles. Its frontiers were threatened. On the east the\r\ntremendous power of Abyssinia loomed terrible and menacing. There was\r\nwar in the north with Egypt and around Suakin with England. The Italians\r\nmust be confronted from the direction of Massowa. Far to the south\r\nEmin Pasha still maintained a troublesome resistance. Yet the Khalifa\r\ntriumphed over nearly all his enemies; and the greatest spectacle which\r\nthe Soudan presented from 1885 to 1898 was of this strong, capable ruler\r\nbearing up against all reverses, meeting each danger, overcoming each\r\ndifficulty, and offering a firm front to every foe.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any complete history of these events will ever be\r\nwritten in a form and style which will interest a later generation. The\r\ncomplications of extraordinary names and the imperfection of the records\r\nmight alone deter the chronicler. The universal squalor of the scenes\r\nand the ignorance of the actors add discouragements. Nor, upon the\r\nother hand, are there great incentives. The tale is one of war of the\r\ncruellest, bloodiest, and most confused type. One savage army slaughters\r\nanother. One fierce general cuts his rival's throat. The same features\r\nare repeated with wearying monotony. When one battle is understood, all\r\nmay be imagined. Above the tumult the figure of the Khalifa rises\r\nstern and solitary, the only object which may attract the interest of\r\na happier world. Yet even the Khalifa's methods were oppressively\r\nmonotonous. For although the nature or courage of the revolts might\r\ndiffer with the occasion, the results were invariable; and the heads\r\nof all his chief enemies, of many of his generals, of most of his\r\ncouncillors, met in the capacious pit which yawned in Omdurman.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteen years of his reign Abdullah tried nearly every\r\ndevice by which Oriental rulers have sought to fortify their perilous\r\nsovereignty. He shrank from nothing. Self-preservation was the guiding\r\nprinciple of his policy, his first object and his only excuse. Among\r\nmany wicked and ingenious expedients three main methods are remarkable.\r\nFirst, he removed or rendered innocuous all real or potential\r\nrivals. Secondly, he pursued what Sir Alfred Milner has called\r\n'a well-considered policy of military concentration.' Thirdly, he\r\nmaintained among the desert and riverain people a balance of power on\r\nthe side of his own tribe. All these three methods merit some attention\r\nor illustration.\r\n\r\nThe general massacre of all possible claimants usually follows the\r\naccession of a usurper to an Oriental throne. The Khalifa was able to\r\navoid this extreme measure. Nevertheless he took precautions. Availing\r\nhimself of the grief and terror that had followed Mohammed Ahmed's\r\ndeath, he had extorted the oath of allegiance from the two other\r\nKhalifas and from the 'Ashraf' or relations of the Prophet. [The Madhi\r\nhad superseded the original Mohammed as 'the Prophet.' His relations\r\nconsequently became 'Ashraf.'] But these complaisant men soon repented\r\nof their submission. Each Khalifa boasted his independence. Each marched\r\nattended by a numerous retinue. Each asserted his right to beat his\r\nown great copper drum. Both the unsuccessful Khalifas combined against\r\nAbdullah. But while they had been busy with the beating of war-drums\r\nand the preparation of pageants, that sagacious ruler had secured the\r\nloyalty of the Baggara tribe, to a section of which he belonged, and\r\nof a considerable force of black riflemen. At length matters reached\r\nclimax. Both parties prepared for war. Abdullah drew up his array\r\nwithout the city, and challenged his rivals to the utmost proof. The\r\ncombined forces of the ousted Khalifas were the more numerous. But\r\nthe fierce Baggara waved their swords, and the Soudanese riflemen were\r\nfamous for their valour. For some hours a bloody struggle appeared\r\nimminent. Then the confederacy broke up. The Khalifa Ali-Wad-Helu, a\r\nprudent man, talked of compromise and amity. The Khalif Sherif,\r\nthus seriously weakened, hastened to make peace while time remained.\r\nEventually both bowed to the superior force of the ruler and the\r\nsuperior courage of his followers. Once they had submitted, their power\r\nwas gone. Abdullah reduced their forces to a personal escort of fifty\r\nmen each, deprived them of their flags and their war-drums--the emblems\r\nof royalty--and they became for the future the useful supporters of a\r\nGovernment they were unable to subvert.\r\n\r\nTo other less powerful and more stubborn enemies he showed a greater\r\nseverity. The Mahdi's two uncles, named respectively Abdel Kerim\r\nand Abdel Kader, were thrown chained into prison, their houses were\r\ndestroyed, and their wives and other property confiscated. The numerous\r\npersons who claimed to be of the 'Ashraf' found the saintly honour\r\na burden upon earth; for, in order to keep them out of mischief, the\r\nKhalifa enjoined them to attend five times every day at the prayers in\r\nthe mosque. Eighteen months of these devotions, declares the Christian\r\nchronicler, were considered 'the highest punishment.' [Ohrwalder, TEN\r\nYEARS' CAPTIVITY.] Still more barbarous was the treatment meted out to\r\nthe unfortunate Emir who had charge of the Treasury. Ahmed Wad Suliman\r\nhad been accustomed under the Mahdi's mild rule to keep no public\r\naccounts, and consequently he had amassed a large fortune. He was\r\nactively hostile to Abdullah, and proclaimed his sympathy with the\r\nAshraf. Whereupon the Khalifa invited him to give an account of his\r\nstewardship. This he was, of course, unable to do. He was then dismissed\r\nfrom his appointment. His private property was taken to fill the\r\ndeficiencies of the State, and the brutal population of Omdurman\r\napplauded his punishment as 'an act of justice.' [Slatin, FIRE AND\r\nSWORD.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Khalifa might establish his authority by such atrocities,\r\nits maintenance depended on the military policy which he consistently\r\npursued. The terrible power of a standing army may usually be exerted by\r\nwhoever can control its leaders, as a mighty engine is set in motion by\r\nthe turning of a handle. Yet to turn the handle some muscular force is\r\nnecessary. Abdullah knew that to rule the Soudan he must have a great\r\narmy. To make the great army obedient he must have another separate\r\nforce; for the influences which keep European armies in subjection\r\nwere not present among the Dervishes. For some years, indeed, he was\r\ncompelled to leave much to chance or the loyalty of his officers.\r\nBut latterly, when he had perfected his organisation, he became quite\r\nindependent and had no need to trust anyone. By degrees and with\r\nastonishing ability he carried out his schemes.\r\n\r\nHe invited his own tribe, the Taaisha section of the Baggara Arabs, to\r\ncome and live in Omdurman. 'Come,' he wrote in numerous letters to them,\r\n'and take possession of the lands which the Lord your God has given\r\nyou.' Allured by the hopes of wealth and wives and the promise of power,\r\nthe savage herdsmen came to the number of 7,000 warriors. Their path was\r\nmade smooth and easy. Granaries were erected along the route. Steamers\r\nand sailing-vessels waited on the Nile. Arrived at the capital, all were\r\nnewly clothed at the expense of the State. An entire district of the\r\ncity was forcibly cleared of its inhabitants for the accommodation of\r\nthe strangers. What the generosity of the Khalifa forgot or refused, the\r\npredatory habits of his clansmen procured; and they robbed, plundered,\r\nand swindled with all the arrogance and impunity of royal favourites.\r\nThe populace of the city returned a bitter hatred for these injuries;\r\nand the Khalifa's object was attained. He had created a class in\r\nOmdurman who were indissolubly attached to him. Like him, they were\r\ndetested by the local tribes. Like him, they were foreigners in the\r\nland. But, like him, they were fierce and brave and strong. His dangers,\r\nhis enemies, his interests were their own. Their lives depended on their\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nHere was the motor muscle which animated the rest. The Taaisha\r\nBaggara controlled the black Jehadia, once the irregular troops of the\r\nEgyptians, now become the regulars of the Khalifa. The black Jehadia\r\noverawed the Arab army in the capital. The army in the capital dominated\r\nthe forces in the provinces. The forces in the provinces subdued\r\nthe inhabitants. The centralisation of power was assured by the\r\nconcentration of military material. Cannon, rifles, stores of\r\nammunition, all the necessities of war were accumulated in the arsenal.\r\nOnly the armies on the frontiers, the Taaisha tribe, and the khalifa's\r\npersonal bodyguard habitually carried firearms and cartridges. The\r\nenormous population of Omdurman was forced to be content with spears and\r\nswords. Rifles were issued to the Soudanese whenever safe and necessary;\r\ncartridges only when they were about to be used. Thus several millions\r\nof warlike and savage people, owning scarcely any law but that of might,\r\nand scattered about a vast roadless territory, were brought into the\r\nfirm grip of a single man.\r\n\r\nThe third principle of government which the Khalifa was compelled, or\r\ninclined, to adopt was to keep the relative power of the various\r\ntribes and classes conveniently proportioned. If an Emir rose to great\r\ninfluence and wealth, he became a possible rival, and suffered forthwith\r\ndeath, imprisonment, or spoliation. If a tribe threatened the supremacy\r\nof the Taaisha it was struck down while its menace was yet a menace. The\r\nregulation of classes and tribes was a far more complicated affair than\r\nthe adjustment of individuals. Yet for thirteen years the Khalifa\r\nheld the balance, and held it exact until the very end. Such was the\r\nstatecraft of a savage from Kordofan.\r\n\r\nHis greatest triumph was the Abyssinian war. It is not likely that two\r\ngreat barbaric kingdoms living side by side, but differing in race and\r\nreligion, will long continue at peace; nor was it difficult to discover\r\na cause of the quarrel between the Dervishes and the Abyssinians. For\r\nsome time a harassing and desultory warfare disturbed the border.\r\nAt length in 1885 a Dervish--half-trader, half brigand--sacked an\r\nAbyssinian church. Bas Adal, the Governor of the Amhara province,\r\ndemanded that this sacrilegious robber should be surrendered to justice.\r\nThe Arabs haughtily refused. The response was swift. Collecting an\r\narmy which may have amounted to 30,000 men, the Abyssinians invaded the\r\ndistrict of Gallabat and marched on the town. Against this host the Emir\r\nWad Arbab could muster no more than 6,000 soldiers. But, encouraged by\r\nthe victories of the previous four years, the Dervishes accepted battle,\r\nin spite of the disparity of numbers. Neither valour nor discipline\r\ncould withstand such odds. The Moslems, broken by the fierce onset and\r\nsurrounded by the overwhelming numbers of their enemies, were destroyed,\r\ntogether with their intrepid leader. Scarcely any escaped. The\r\nAbyssinians indulged in all the triumphs of savagery. The wounded were\r\nmassacred: the slain were mutilated: the town of Gallabat was sacked and\r\nburnt. The Women were carried into captivity. All these tidings came to\r\nOmdurman. Under this heavy and unexpected blow the Khalifa acted with\r\nprudence. He opened negotiations with King John of Abyssinia, for the\r\nransom of the captured wives and children, and at the same time he sent\r\nthe Emir Yunes with a large force to Gallabat. The immediate necessities\r\nhaving thus been dealt with, Abdullah prepared for revenge.\r\n\r\nOf all the Arab leaders which fifteen years of continual war and tumult\r\nthroughout the Soudan produced, none displayed higher ability, none\r\nobtained greater successes, and none were more honourable, though\r\nseveral were more famous, than the man whom the Khalifa selected to\r\navenge the destruction of the Gallabat army. Abu Anga had been a slave\r\nin Abdullah's family long before the Mahdi had preached at Abba island\r\nand while Egypt yet oppressed the country. After the revolt had broken\r\nout, his adventurous master summoned him from the distant Kordofan home\r\nto attend him in the war, and Abu Anga came with that ready obedience\r\nand strange devotion for which he was always distinguished. Nominally\r\nas a slave, really as a comrade, he fought by Abdullah's side in all the\r\nearlier battles of the rebellion. Nor was it until after the capture\r\nof El Obeid that he rose suddenly to power and place. The Khalifa was a\r\njudge of men. He saw very clearly that the black Soudanese troops, who\r\nhad surrendered and were surrendering as town after town was taken,\r\nmight be welded into a powerful weapon. And in Abu Anga he knew a man\r\nwho could not only fashion the blade, but would hold it ever loyally at\r\nhis master's disposal. The former slave threw himself into the duties\r\nof his command with extraordinary energy. His humble origin pleased the\r\nhardy blacks, who recognised in their leader their equal in birth, their\r\nsuperior in prowess. More than any other Emir, Abu Anga contributed\r\nto the destruction of Hicks's army. The Jehadia, as his soldiers were\r\ncalled--because they had joined in the Jehad, or Holy War--were armed\r\nwith Remington rifles, and their harassing fire inflicted heavy losses\r\non the struggling column until it was finally brought to a standstill,\r\nand the moment for the spearmen to charge arrived. Henceforward the\r\ntroops of Abu Anga became famous throughout the land for their weapons,\r\ntheir courage, and their cruelty. Their numbers at first did not exceed\r\n5,000; but as more towns were taken and more slaves were turned into\r\nsoldiers they increased, until at one time they reached the formidable\r\ntotal of 15,000 men. During the siege of Khartoum the black riflemen\r\ndistinguished themselves by the capture of Omdurman fort, but their\r\nviolent natures and predatory instincts made them an undesirable\r\ngarrison even for the Dervish capital, and they were despatched under\r\ntheir general to Kordofan, where they increased their reputation by a\r\nseries of bloody fights with the Nubas, an aboriginal mountain people\r\nwho cared for nothing but their independence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June Abu Anga reached Omdurman with an army variously\r\nestimated at from 22,000 to 31,000 men, of whom at least 10,000 were\r\narmed with Remington rifles. The Khalifa received him with the utmost\r\nhonour. After a private interview, which lasted for several hours, a\r\nformal entry into the town was arranged. At daybreak on the following\r\nmorning the whole force marched into the city and camped along the\r\nnorthern suburbs, applauded and welcomed alike by the population and\r\ntheir ruler. A few days after this a great review was held under the\r\nKerreri hills, on the very ground where the Dervish Empire was doomed\r\nto be shattered. But the fateful place oppressed the Khalifa with no\r\nforebodings. He exulted in his power: and well he might, for after the\r\ncannon had thundered indefinite salutes, no fewer than 100,000 armed men\r\ndefiled to the music of the war-drums and the ombyas before the famous\r\nBlack Flag. The spectacle of the enormous numbers provoked their\r\nenthusiasm. The triumphant Khalifa was cheered by his mighty host, who\r\npressed upon him in their exuberant loyalty until he was almost crushed.\r\nIt was indeed a stirring scene. The whole plain was filled with the\r\nthrong. Banners of every hue and shape waved gaily in the breeze,\r\nand the sunlight glinted from innumerable spear-points. The swarming\r\nDervishes displayed their bright parti-coloured jibbas. The wild Baggara\r\ncavalry circled on the flanks of the array. The brown dome of the\r\nMahdi's tomb, rising above the city, seemed to assure the warriors of\r\nsupernatural aid. Abdullah was at the summit of his power. The movement\r\ninitiated by the priest of Abba island had attained its climax. Behind,\r\nin the plain, the frowning rocks of Surgham Hill rose ragged and gloomy,\r\nas if their silence guarded the secrets of the future.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast of Bairam had been celebrated on a gigantic scale,\r\nAbu Anga was despatched to Gallabat with his army and considerable\r\nreinforcements from the troops in Omdurman, and it became evident that\r\nwar with Abyssinia was imminent. The great leader relieved the Emir\r\nYunes, much to the latter's disgust, of the chief command, and, since\r\nthe strong Gallabat garrison was added to his own force, Abu Anga\r\nwas able to take the field at the head of 15,000 riflemen and 45,000\r\nspearmen. The Khalifa had embarked on a great venture in planning the\r\ninvasion of Abyssinia. The vast strength of the Negus was known to\r\nthe Dervishes, and has since been proved to the world. The Mahdi had\r\nforbidden such a war. An ill-omened prophecy further declared that the\r\nKing of Abyssinia would tether his horse to a solitary tree by Khartoum,\r\nwhile his cavalry should ride through the city fetlock deep in blood.\r\nBut Abdullah feared neither God nor man. He reviewed the political\r\nsituation, and determined at all risks to maintain his frontiers\r\ninviolate. His Emir Wad Arbab had been killed. Blood must settle the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinians had not watched the extensive hostile preparations\r\napathetically. Ras Adal had collected an army which in numbers actually\r\nexceeded that of the Dervishes. But the latter were far superior in\r\nrifles, and the black infantry were of invincible valour. Nevertheless,\r\nconfident in his strength and relying on his powerful cavalry, the\r\nAbyssinian general allowed the Arabs to toil through all the mountainous\r\ncountry, to traverse the Mintik Pass, and to debouch unmolested on to\r\nthe plain of Debra Sin. Abu Anga neglected no precaution. He knew that\r\nsince he must fight in the heart of Abyssinia, with the mountains behind\r\nhim, a defeat would involve annihilation. He drew up his army swiftly\r\nand with skill. Then the Abyssinians attacked. The rifle fire of the\r\nSoudanese repulsed them. The onset was renewed with desperate gallantry.\r\nIt was resisted with equal valour and superior weapons. After frightful\r\nlosses the Abyssinians wavered, and the wise Arab seized the moment for\r\na counterstroke. In spite of the devotion of his cavalry Ras Adal was\r\ndriven from the field. Great numbers of his army were drowned in the\r\nriver in front of which he had recklessly elected to fight. His camp was\r\ncaptured, and a valuable spoil rewarded the victors, who also gratified\r\ntheir passions with a wholesale slaughter of the wounded--a practice\r\ncommonly followed by savages. The effect of the victory was great.\r\nThe whole of the Amhara province submitted to the invaders, and in the\r\nspring of 1887 Abu Anga was able to advance without further fighting to\r\nthe capture and sack of Gondar, the ancient capital of Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Khalifa had been anxiously expecting tidings of his army.\r\nThe long silence of thirty days which followed their plunge into the\r\nmountains filled him with fear, and Ohrwalder relates that he 'aged\r\nvisibly' during that period. But his judgment was proved by the event,\r\nand the arrival of a selected assortment of heads turned doubt to\r\ntriumph. The Dervishes did not long remain in Abyssinia, as they\r\nsuffered from the climate. In December the army returned to Gallabat,\r\nwhich they commenced to fortify, and their victorious general followed\r\nhis grisly but convincing despatch to Omdurman, where he received the\r\nusual welcome accorded by warlike peoples to military heroes. But the\r\nfamous and faithful slave may have been more gratified by the tears of\r\njoy which his master and sovereign shed on beholding him again safe and\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe greater struggle was still to come. The whole of Abyssinia was\r\nconvulsed with fury, and King John in person prepared to take the field\r\nand settle the quarrel for ever. He assembled a mighty host, which is\r\nsaid to have amounted to 130,000 foot and 20,000 horsemen. The rumours\r\nof this formidable concentration reached Gallabat and Omdurman, and\r\nin spite of the recent victory caused deep alarm. The Khalifa saw his\r\nfrontiers--even his existence--menaced, for King John had declared that\r\nhe would sweep the Dervishes from off the face of the earth: and in the\r\nhour of need the general on whom so much depended died of some poisonous\r\nmedicine with which he had endeavoured to cure himself of indigestion.\r\nAbu Anga was buried in his red-brick house at Gallabat amid the\r\nlamentations of his brave black soldiers, and gloom pervaded the whole\r\narmy. But, since the enemy were approaching, the danger had to be faced.\r\nThe Khalifa appointed Zeki Tummal, one of Anga's lieutenants, to the\r\ncommand of the forces at Gallabat, which by strenuous exertions he\r\nbrought up to a total of 85,000 men. King John sent word that he was\r\ncoming, lest any should say that he had come secretly as a thief.\r\nThe Dervishes resolved to remain on the defensive, and, fortifying\r\nthemselves in an enormous zeriba around the town, awaited the onslaught.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 9th of March, 1889, the Abyssinians came within sight of\r\ntheir enemies, and early the next morning the battle began. Great clouds\r\nof dust obscured the scene, and all intelligible sounds were lost in\r\nthe appalling din. The Abyssinians, undaunted by the rifle fire of the\r\nSoudanese, succeeded in setting the zeriba alight. Then, concentrating\r\nall their force on one part of the defence, they burst into the\r\nenclosure and town. The division of Wad Ali, a fourth part of the entire\r\nDervish army, which bore the brunt of this attack, was almost completely\r\ndestroyed. The interior of the zeriba was crowded with women and\r\nchildren, who were ruthlessly butchered by the exultant Abyssinians. The\r\nassailants scattered in all directions in search of plunder, and they\r\neven had time to begin to disinter the body of Abu Anga, which they were\r\neager to insult in revenge for Gondar. The Dervishes already wavered;\r\ntheir ammunition began to fail, when suddenly a rumour spread about\r\namong the Abyssinians that the King was killed. Seizing what booty\r\nthey could snatch, the victorious army began a general retreat, and the\r\nzeriba was soon cleared. The Arabs were too exhausted to pursue, but\r\nwhen on the following day the attack was not renewed they learned, to\r\ntheir surprise, that they were the victors and that their enemy was\r\nfalling back towards the Atbara river. Zeki Tummal resolved to pursue,\r\nand his army were further incited to the chase by the fact that the\r\nAbyssinians had carried off with them a large number of Dervish women,\r\nincluding the harem of the late beloved Abu Anga. Two days after the\r\nbattle the Dervishes overtook the enemy's rearguard and, surprising\r\ntheir camp, inflicted severe loss and captured much booty. The temporary\r\nNegus who had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of\r\nKing John was among the killed. The body of that courageous monarch fell\r\ninto the hands of the Dervishes, who struck off the head and sent\r\nit--a tangible proof of victory--to Omdurman. The Abyssinians, still\r\nformidable, made good their retreat; nor did Zeki Tummal venture to\r\nfollow into the mountains. Internal difficulties within his dominions\r\nprevented the new Negus from resuming the offensive, and thus the\r\nDervish-Abyssinian war dwindled down to, as it had arisen out of,\r\nfrontier raids.\r\n\r\nThe arrival in Omdurman of King John's head intoxicated the Khalifa with\r\njoy. Abyssinia was regarded throughout the Soudan as a far greater power\r\nthan Egypt, and here was its mighty ruler slain and decapitated. But the\r\nvictory had been dearly purchased. The two great battles had been\r\nfought with indescribable ferocity by both sides, and the slaughter\r\nwas appalling. No reliable statistics are avaliable, but it may be\r\nreasonably asserted that neither side sustained a loss in killed during\r\nthe war of fewer than 15,000 fighting men. The flower of the Dervish\r\narmy, the heroic blacks of Abu Anga, were almost destroyed. The Khalifa\r\nhad won a Pyrrhic triumph. Never again was he able to put so great\r\na force in the field, and, although the army which was shattered at\r\nOmdurman was better armed and better drilled, it was less formidable\r\nthan that which broke the might of Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the struggle with Abyssinia the war against Egypt\r\nlanguished. The Mahdi, counting upon the support of the population, had\r\nalways declared that he would free the Delta from 'the Turks,' and was\r\nalready planning its invasion when he and his schemes were interrupted\r\nby death. His successor inherited all the quarrel, but not all the\r\npower. Much of Mohammed Ahmed's influence died with him. Alive, he\r\nmight conquer the Moslem world; dead, he was only a saint. All fanatical\r\nfeeling in Egypt soon subsided. Nevertheless the Khalifa persisted in\r\nthe enterprise. The success of the Abyssinian war encouraged and enabled\r\nhim to resume the offensive on his northern frontier, and he immediately\r\nordered Wad-el-Nejumi, who commanded in Dongola, to march with his\r\nscanty force to the invasion of Egypt. The mad enterprise ended, as\r\nmight have been foreseen, in the destruction of both Emir and army at\r\nToski. The Khalifa received the news with apparent grief, but it is\r\ndifficult to avoid suspecting him of dark schemes. He was far too clever\r\nto believe that Egypt could be conquered by five thousand men. He knew\r\nthat besides the Egyptians there was a strange white tribe of men,\r\nthe same that had so nearly saved Khartoum. 'But for the English,' he\r\nexclaimed on several occasions, 'I would have conquered Egypt.' Yet,\r\nknowing of the British occupation, he deliberately sent an army to its\r\ninevitable ruin. It is difficult to reconcile such conduct with the\r\ncharacter for sagacity and intelligence which Abdullah has deserved.\r\nThere is no doubt that he wanted to conquer Egypt. Possibly by some\r\nextraordinary chance Wad-el-Nejumi might succeed, even with his small\r\nforce. If so, then the glory of God and the power of the Khalifa would\r\nadvance together. If not--and herein lies the true reason for the\r\nventure--the riverain tribes would have received a crippling blow.\r\n\r\nThe terrible slaughter of the Abyssinian war had fallen mainly on the\r\nJehadia and the eastern Arabs. The jealous tribes in the north had not\r\nsuffered. The balance of power was in need of re-adjustment. The Jaalin\r\nand Barabra were fast becoming dangerous. Nejumi's army was recruited\r\nalmost entirely from these sources. The reinforcements sent from\r\nOmdurman consisted of men selected from the flag of the Khalifa Sherif,\r\nwho was growing too powerful, and of the Batahin tribe, who had shown a\r\nmutinous spirit [Ohrwalder, TEN YEARS' CAPTIVITY.] The success of such\r\nan army in Egypt would be glorious. Its destruction anywhere would be\r\nconvenient. Whatever Abdullah's motives may have been, his advantage was\r\ncertain. But the life of the empire thus compelled to prey upon itself\r\nmust necessarily be short.\r\n\r\nOther forces were soon added to the work of exhaustion. The year\r\nfollowing the end of the Abyssinian war was marked by a fearful famine.\r\nSlatin and Ohrwalder vie with each other in relating its horrors--men\r\neating the raw entrails of donkeys; mothers devouring their babies;\r\nscores dying in the streets, all the more ghastly in the bright\r\nsunlight; hundreds of corpses floating down the Nile--these are among\r\nthe hideous features, The depopulation caused by the scarcity was even\r\ngreater than that produced by the fighting. The famine area extended\r\nover the whole Soudan and ran along the banks of the river as far as\r\nLower Egypt. The effects of the famine were everywhere appalling. Entire\r\ndistricts between Omdurman and Berber became wholly depopulated. In the\r\nsalt regions near Shendi almost all the inhabitants died of hunger.\r\nThe camel-breeding tribes ate their she-camels. The riverain peoples\r\ndevoured their seed-corn. The population of Gallabat, Gedaref, and\r\nKassala was reduced by nine-tenths, and these once considerable towns\r\nshrank to the size of hamlets. Everywhere the deserted mud houses\r\ncrumbled back into the plain. The frightful mortality, general\r\nthroughout the whole country, may be gauged by the fact that Zeki\r\nTummal's army, which before the famine numbered not fewer than 87,000,\r\ncould scarcely muster 10,000 men in the spring of 1890.\r\n\r\nThe new harvest came only in time to save the inhabitants of the\r\nSoudan from becoming extinct. The remnant were preserved for further\r\nmisfortunes. War, scarcity, and oppression there had always been. But\r\nstrange and mysterious troubles began to afflict the tortured tribes.\r\nThe face of heaven was pitiless or averted. In 1890 innumerable swarms\r\nof locusts descended on the impoverished soil. The multitude of their\r\nred or yellow bodies veiled the sun and darkened the air, and although\r\ntheir flesh, tasting when roasted like fried shrimps, might afford a\r\ndelicate meal to the natives, they took so heavy a toll of the crops\r\nthat the famine was prolonged and scarcity became constant. Since\r\ntheir first appearance the locusts are said to have returned annually\r\n[Ohrwalder, TEN YEARS' CAPTIVITY.] Their destructive efforts were aided\r\nby millions of little red mice, who destroyed the seeds before they\r\ncould grow. So vast and immeasurable was the number of these tiny pests\r\nthat after a heavy rain the whole country was strewn with, and almost\r\ntinted by, the squirrel-coloured corpses of the drowned.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of all the strokes of fate, the Khalifa maintained his\r\nauthority unshaken. The centralisation which always occurs in military\r\nStates was accelerated by the famine. The provincial towns dwindled;\r\nthousands and tens of thousands perished; but Omdurman continually grew,\r\nand its ruler still directed the energies of a powerful army. Thus for\r\nthe present we might leave the Dervish Empire. Yet the gloomy city of\r\nblood, mud, and filth that arose by the confluence of the Niles deserves\r\na final glance while still in the pride of independent barbarism.\r\n\r\nIt is early morning, and the sun, lifting above the horizon, throws the\r\nshadows of the Khartoum ruins on the brimful waters of the Nile. The old\r\ncapital is solitary and deserted. No sound of man breaks the silence of\r\nits streets. Only memory broods in the garden where the Pashas used to\r\nwalk, and the courtyard where the Imperial envoy fell. Across the\r\nriver miles of mud houses, lining the banks as far as Khor Shambat, and\r\nstretching back into the desert and towards the dark hills, display\r\nthe extent of the Arab metropolis. As the sun rises, the city begins to\r\nlive. Along the road from Kerreri a score of camels pad to market with\r\nvillage produce. The north wind is driving a dozen sailing-boats, laden\r\nto the water's edge with merchandise, to the wharves. One of Gordon's\r\nold steamers lies moored by the bank. Another, worked by the crew that\r\nmanned it in Egyptian days, is threshing up the Blue Nile, sent by the\r\nKhalifa to Sennar on some errand of State. Far away to the southward the\r\ndust of a Darfur caravan breaks the clear-cut skyline with a misty blur.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged beating of war-drums and loud booming notes of horns\r\nchase away the silence of the night. It is Friday, and after the hour\r\nof prayer all grown men must attend the review on the plain without the\r\ncity. Already the streets are crowded with devout and obedient warriors.\r\nsoon the great square of the mosque--for no roof could shelter so many\r\nthousand worshippers--is filled with armed men, kneeling in humble\r\nsupplication to the stern God of Islam and his most holy Mahdi. It\r\nis finished. They rise and hurry to the parade. The Emirs plant their\r\nflags, and all form in the ranks. Woe to the laggard; and let the speedy\r\nsee that he wear his newest jibba, and carry a sharp sword and at least\r\nthree spears. Presently the array is complete.\r\n\r\nA salute of seven guns is fired. Mounted on a fine camel, which is led\r\nby a gigantic Nubian, and attended by perhaps two hundred horsemen in\r\nchain armour, the Khalifa rides on to the ground and along the ranks.\r\nIt is a good muster. Few have dared absent themselves. Yet his brow is\r\nclouded. What has happened? Is there another revolt in the west? Do the\r\nAbyssinians threaten Gallabat? Have the black troops mutinied; or is it\r\nonly some harem quarrel?\r\n\r\nThe parade is over. The troops march back to the arsenal. The rifles are\r\ncollected, and the warriors disperse to their homes. Many hurry to the\r\nmarket-place to make purchases, to hear the latest rumour, or to watch\r\nthe executions--for there are usually executions. Others stroll to the\r\nSuk-er-Rekik and criticise the points of the slave girls as the dealers\r\noffer them for sale. But the Khalifa has returned to his house, and\r\nhis council have been summoned. The room is small, and the ruler sits\r\ncross-legged upon his couch. Before him squat the Emirs and Kadis.\r\nYakub is there, with Ali-Wad-Helu and the Khalifa Sherif. Only the\r\nSheikh-ed-Din is absent, for he is a dissolute youth and much given to\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nAbdullah is grave and anxious. A messenger has come from the north.\r\nThe Turks are on the move. Advancing beyond their frontier, they have\r\nestablished themselves at Akasha. Wad Bishara fears lest they may attack\r\nthe faithful who hold Firket. In itself this is but a small matter, for\r\nall these years there has been frontier fighting. But what follows is\r\nfull of menacing significance. The 'enemies of God' have begun to repair\r\nthe railway--have repaired it, so that the train already runs beyond\r\nSarras. Even now they push their iron road out into the desert towards\r\ntheir position at Akasha and to the south. What is the object of their\r\ntoil? Are they coming again? Will they bring those terrible white\r\nsoldiers who broke the hearts of the Hadendoa and almost destroyed\r\nthe Degheim and Kenana? What should draw them up the Nile? Is it for\r\nplunder, or in sheer love of war; or is it a blood feud that brings\r\nthem? True, they are now far off. Perchance they will return, as they\r\nreturned before. Yet the iron road is not built in a day, nor for a day,\r\nand of a surety there are war-clouds in the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: THE YEARS OF PREPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1886, when all the troops had retreated to Wady Halfa\r\nand all the Soudan garrisons had been massacred, the British people\r\naverted their eyes in shame and vexation from the valley of the Nile. A\r\nlong succession of disasters had reached their disgraceful culmination.\r\nThe dramatic features added much to the bitterness and nothing to the\r\ngrandeur of the tragedy. The cost was heavy. Besides the pain produced\r\nby the death of General Gordon, the heavy losses in officers and men,\r\nand the serious expenditure of public money, the nation smarted under\r\nfailure and disappointment, and were, moreover, deeply sensible that\r\nthey had been humiliated before the whole world. The situation in\r\nEgypt was scarcely more pleasing. The reforms initiated by the\r\nBritish Administrators had as yet only caused unpopularity. Baring's\r\ninterference galled the Khedive and his Ministers. Vincent's parsimony\r\nexcited contempt. Moncrieff's energy had convulsed the Irrigation\r\nDepartment. Wood's army was the laughing-stock of Europe. Among and\r\nbeneath the rotten weeds and garbage of old systems and abuses the new\r\nseed was being sown. But England saw no signs of the crop; saw only\r\nthe stubborn husbandmen begrimed with the dust and dirt, and herself\r\nhopelessly involved in the Egyptian muddle: and so in utter weariness\r\nand disgust, stopping her ears to the gibes and cat-calls of the Powers,\r\nshe turned towards other lands and other matters.\r\n\r\nWhen the attention of the nation was again directed to Egypt the scene\r\nwas transformed. It was as though at the touch of an angel the dark\r\nmorasses of the Slough of Despond had been changed to the breezy slopes\r\nof the Delectable Mountains. The Khedive and his Ministers lay quiet and\r\ndocile in the firm grasp of the Consul-General. The bankrupt State was\r\nspending surpluses upon internal improvement. The disturbed Irrigation\r\nDepartment was vivifying the land. The derided army held the frontier\r\nagainst all comers. Astonishment gave place to satisfaction, and\r\nsatisfaction grew into delight. The haunting nightmare of Egyptian\r\npolitics ended. Another dream began--a bright if vague vision of\r\nImperial power, of trans-continental railways, of African Viceroys, of\r\nconquest and commerce. The interest of the British people in the work of\r\nregeneration grew continually. Each new reform was hailed with applause.\r\nEach annual Budget was scrutinised with pride. England exulted in the\r\ntriumph of failure turned into success. There was a general wish to know\r\nmore about Egypt and the men who had done these great things. In 1893\r\nthis desire was satisfied, and yet stimulated by the publication of Sir\r\nAlfred Milner's 'England in Egypt.' His skilful pen displayed what had\r\nbeen overcome, no less than what was accomplished. By explaining the\r\ndifficulties he enhanced the achievement. He showed how, while Great\r\nBritain was occupied elsewhere, her brilliant, persevering sons had\r\nrepeated on a lesser scale in Egypt the marvellous evolution which\r\nis working out in India. Smaller systems circulate more rapidly. The\r\nadministrators were guided by experience. The movement had been far\r\nswifter, and the results were more surprising. Such was the wonderful\r\nstory, and it was told in a happy moment. The audience were eager and\r\nsympathetic. The subject was enthralling. The story-teller had a wit\r\nand a style that might have brightened the dullest theme. In these\r\npropitious circumstances the book was more than a book. The words rang\r\nlike the trumpet-call which rallies the soldiers after the parapets are\r\nstormed, and summons them to complete the victory.\r\n\r\nThe regeneration of Egypt is not a theme which would fall within the\r\nlimits of this account, even if it had not been fully dealt with by Sir\r\nAlfred Milner. But the reorganisation of the Egyptian army, the forging\r\nof the weapon of reconquest, is an essential feature. On the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1882, the old Egyptian army--or, rather, such parts as had\r\nescaped destruction--was disbanded by a single sentence of a British\r\ndecree, and it was evident that some military body must replace that\r\nwhich had been swept away. All sorts of schemes for the employment of\r\nforeign legions or Turkish janissaries were devised. But Lord Dufferin\r\nadhered firmly to the principle of entrusting the defence of a country\r\nto its inhabitants, and it was determined to form a new Egyptian army.\r\nThe poverty of the government, no less than the apparent folly of the\r\nexperiment, demanded that the new army should be small. The force was\r\nintended only for the preservation of internal order and the defence of\r\nthe southern and western frontiers of Egypt against the Bedouin Arabs.\r\nThe Soudan still slumbered out its long nightmare. Six thousand men was\r\nthe number originally drawn by conscription--for there are no volunteers\r\nin Egypt--from a population of more than 6,000,000. Twenty-six British\r\nofficers--either poor men attracted by the high rates of pay, or\r\nambitious allured by the increased authority--and a score of excellent\r\ndrill-sergeants undertook the duty of teaching the recruits to fight.\r\nSir Evelyn Wood directed the enterprise, and became the first British\r\nSirdar of the Egyptian army. The work began and immediately prospered.\r\nWithin three months of its formation the army had its first review. The\r\nwhole 6,000 paraded in their battalions and marched past the Khedive\r\nand their country's flag. Their bearing and their drill extorted the\r\nhalf-contemptuous praise of the indifferent spectators. Experienced\r\nsoldiers noticed other points. Indeed, the new army differed greatly\r\nfrom the old. In the first place, it was paid. The recruits were treated\r\nwith justice. Their rations were not stolen by the officers. The men\r\nwere given leave to go to their villages from time to time. When they\r\nfell sick, they were sent to hospital instead of being flogged. In\r\nshort, the European system was substituted for the Oriental.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly possible that the fertile soil and enervating climate\r\nof the Delta would have evolved a warrior race. Ages of oppression and\r\npoverty rarely produce proud and warlike spirits. Patriotism does not\r\ngrow under the 'Kourbash.' The fellah soldier lacks the desire to kill.\r\nEven the Mohammedan religion has failed to excite his ferocity. He may\r\nbe cruel. He is never fierce. Yet he is not without courage--a courage\r\nwhich bears pain and hardship in patience, which confronts ill-fortune\r\nwith indifference, and which looks on death with apathetic composure.\r\nIt is the courage of down-trodden peoples, and one which stronger breeds\r\nmay often envy, though they can scarcely be expected to admire. He has\r\nother military virtues. He is obedient, honest, sober, well-behaved,\r\nquick to learn, and, above all, physically strong. Generations of\r\ntoiling ancestors, though they could not brace his nerves, have braced\r\nhis muscles. Under the pressure of local circumstances there has\r\nbeen developed a creature who can work with little food, with little\r\nincentive, very hard for long hours under a merciless sun. Throughout\r\nthe river campaigns, if the intellect of the army, if the spirit of the\r\ntroops, have come from without, Egypt herself has provided the sinews of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nSuch was the material out of which the British officers have formed the\r\nnew Egyptian army. At first, indeed, their task was embittered by the\r\nridicule of their comrades in the British and Indian Services; but as\r\nthe drill and bearing of the force improved, the thoughtless scorn would\r\nhave been diverted from the Englishmen to fall only upon the Egyptian\r\nsoldiers. But this was not allowed. The British officers identified\r\nthemselves with their men. Those who abused the fellah soldier were\r\nreminded that they insulted English gentlemen. Thus a strange bond of\r\nunion was established between the officers and soldiers of the Egyptian\r\nService; and although material forces may have accomplished much,\r\nwithout this moral factor the extraordinary results would never have\r\nbeen achieved.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the new military organisation was exposed to the\r\nstern test of war. The army that was raised to preserve internal order\r\nwas soon called upon to guard the frontier. The revolt in the\r\nSoudan, which in its earlier stages seemed the least of the Egyptian\r\ndifficulties, speedily dwarfed all the rest. The value of the new force\r\nwas soon recognised. In June 1883 we find General Hicks, then preparing\r\nfor his fatal march, writing to Sir Evelyn Wood: 'Send me four\r\nbattalions of your new army, and I shall be content.' But fortune\r\nprotected the infant organisation from such a disastrous beginning. The\r\n'new army' remained for a space in Cairo; and although during the Nile\r\nexpedition of 1884-85 the Egyptians were employed guarding the lines of\r\ncommunication, it was not until the British troops had been withdrawn\r\nfrom Dongola that they received at Ginniss their baptism of fire.\r\nHenceforth their place was on the frontier, and from 1886 onward the\r\nEgyptian troops proved equal to the task of resisting the northward\r\npressure of the Dervishes.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the army grew with its responsibilities. Up to the end of\r\n1883 the infantry still consisted of eight fellahin battalions. In 1884\r\nthe first Soudanese battalion was raised. The black soldier was of a\r\nvery different type from the fellahin. The Egyptian was strong, patient,\r\nhealthy, and docile. The negro was in all these respects his inferior.\r\nHis delicate lungs, slim legs, and loosely knit figure contrasted\r\nunfavourably with the massive frame and iron constitution of the peasant\r\nof the Delta. Always excitable and often insubordinate, he required the\r\nstrictest discipline. At once slovenly and uxorious, he detested his\r\ndrills and loved his wives with equal earnestness; and altogether\r\n'Sambo'--for such is the Soudanese equivalent of 'Tommy'--was a lazy,\r\nfierce, disreputable child. But he possessed two tremendous military\r\nvirtues. To the faithful loyalty of a dog he added the heart of a\r\nlion. He loved his officer, and feared nothing in the world. With the\r\nintroduction of this element the Egyptian army became a formidable\r\nmilitary machine. Chance or design has placed the blacks ever in the\r\nforefront of the battle, and in Lord Kitchener's campaigns on the Nile\r\nthe losses in the six Soudanese battalions have exceeded the aggregate\r\nof the whole of the rest of the army.\r\n\r\nIt was well that the Egyptian troops were strengthened by these valiant\r\nauxiliaries, for years of weary war lay before them. Sir Reginald\r\nWingate, in his exhaustive account of the struggle of Egypt with the\r\nMahdist power, [MAHDISM AND THE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN, Sir Reginald Wingate]\r\nhas described the successive actions which accompanied the defence of\r\nthe Wady Halfa frontier and of Suakin.\r\n\r\nThe ten years that elapsed between Ginniss and the first movements of\r\nthe expedition of re-conquest were the dreary years of the Egyptian\r\narmy. The service was hard and continual. Though the operations were\r\npetty, an untiring vigilance was imperative. The public eye was averted.\r\nA pitiless economy was everywhere enforced. The British officer was\r\ndeprived of his leave and the Egyptian private of his rations, that a\r\nfew pounds might be saved to the Egyptian Treasury. The clothing of the\r\nbattalions wore thin and threadbare, and sometimes their boots were so\r\nbad that the soldiers' feet bled from the cutting edges of the rocks,\r\nand the convoy escorts left their trails behind them. But preparation\r\nwas ever going forward. The army improved in efficiency, and the\r\nconstant warfare began to produce, even among the fellahin infantry,\r\nexperienced soldiers. The officers, sweltering at weary Wady Halfa and\r\nSuakin, looked at the gathering resources of Egypt and out into the\r\ndeserts of the declining Dervish Empire and knew that some day their\r\nturn would come. The sword of re-conquest which Evelyn Wood had forged,\r\nand Grenfell had tested, was gradually sharpened; and when the process\r\nwas almost complete, the man who was to wield it presented himself.\r\n\r\nHoratio Herbert Kitchener, the eldest son of a lieutenant-colonel, was\r\nborn in 1850, and, after being privately educated, entered in 1869 the\r\nRoyal Military Academy at Woolwich as a cadet of the Royal Engineers.\r\nIn the spring of 1871 he obtained his commission, and for the first ten\r\nyears of his military service remained an obscure officer, performing\r\nhis duties with regularity, but giving no promise of the talents and\r\ncharacter which he was afterwards to display. One powerful weapon,\r\nhowever, he acquired in this time of waiting. In 1874 accident or\r\ninstinct led him to seek employment in the surveys that were being made\r\nof Cyprus and Palestine, and in the latter country he learned Arabic.\r\nFor six years the advantage of knowing a language with which few British\r\nofficers were familiar brought him no profit. For procuring military\r\npreferment Arabic was in 1874 as valueless as Patagonian. All this\r\nwas swiftly changed by the unexpected course of events. The year 1882\r\nbrought the British fleet to Alexandria, and the connection between\r\nEngland and Egypt began to be apparent. Kitchener did not neglect his\r\nopportunity. Securing leave of absence, he hurried to the scene of\r\ncrisis. Alexandria was bombarded. Detachments from the fleet were landed\r\nto restore order. The British Government decided to send an army to\r\nEgypt. British officers and soldiers were badly wanted at the seat of\r\nwar; an officer who could speak Arabic was indispensable.\r\n\r\nThus Kitchener came to Egypt and set his feet firmly on the high road to\r\nfortune. He came to Egypt when she was plunged in misery and shame, when\r\nhopeless ruin seemed already the only outcome of the public disasters,\r\nand when even greater misfortunes impended. He remained to see her\r\nprosperous and powerful; to restore empire to her people, peace to her\r\nempire, honour to her army; and among those clear-minded men of action\r\nby whom the marvellous work of regeneration has been accomplished,\r\nHerbert Kitchener will certainly occupy the second place. Lord Wolseley\r\non his arrival soon found employment for the active officer who could\r\nspeak Arabic. He served through the campaign of 1882 as a major. He\r\njoined the new army which was formed at the conclusion of the war, as\r\none of the original twenty-six officers. In the Nile expedition of\r\n1885 Arabic again led him to the front, and in the service of the\r\nIntelligence Department he found ample opportunity for his daring and\r\nenergy. His efforts to communicate with Gordon in Khartoum did not,\r\nhowever, meet with much success, and the Journals bristle with so many\r\nsarcastic comments that their editor has been at pains to explain in his\r\npreface that there was really no cause for complaint. Major Kitchener,\r\nhowever, gave satisfaction to his superiors in Cairo, if not to the\r\nexacting General at Khartoum, and in 1886 he was appointed Governor\r\nof Suakin. This post, always one of responsibility and danger, did not\r\nsatisfy Kitchener, whose ambition was now taking definite form. Eager\r\nfor more responsibility and more danger, he harried and raided the\r\nsurrounding tribes; he restricted and almost destroyed the slender trade\r\nwhich was again springing up, and in consequence of his measures the\r\nneighbourhood of Suakin was soon in even greater ferment than usual.\r\nThis culminated at the end of 1887 in the re-appearance and advance of\r\nOsman Digna. The movements of the Dervishes were, however, uncertain.\r\nThe defences of the town had been greatly strengthened and improved\r\nby the skill and activity of its new Governor. [See dispatch from\r\nMajor-General Dormer to War Office, Cairo, April 22, 1888: 'With regard\r\nto the military works and defenses of the town, I was much struck with\r\nthe great improvement that has been effected by Colonel Kitchener since\r\nmy last visit to Suakin in the autumn of 1884.] Osman Digna retreated.\r\nThe 'friendlies' were incited to follow, and Kitchener, although he had\r\nbeen instructed not to employ British officers or Egyptian regulars in\r\noffensive operations, went out in support. At Handub on the morning of\r\nthe 17th of January, 1888, the friendlies attacked the camp of Osman\r\nDigna. They were at first successful; but while they dispersed to\r\nplunder the enemy rallied and, returning, drove them back with loss.\r\nKitchener arrived on the field with the support, to find a defeat\r\ninstead of a victory awaiting him. He bravely endeavoured to cover the\r\nretreat of the friendlies, and in so doing was severely--as it first\r\nseemed dangerously--wounded in the jaw. The loss among the friendlies\r\nand the support amounted to twenty men killed and two British officers\r\nand twenty-eight men wounded. The Governor returned in great pain and\r\nsome discomfiture to Suakin. In spite of his wound and his reverse he\r\nwas impatient to renew the conflict, but this was definitely forbidden\r\nby the British Government. Colonel Kitchener's military conduct was\r\npraised, but his policy was prevented. 'The policy which it is desirable\r\nto follow ... in the Eastern Soudan,' wrote Sir Evelyn Baring on the\r\n17th of March, in measured rebuke, 'should consist in standing purely\r\non the defensive against any hostile movement or combination of the\r\nArab tribes, in avoiding any course of action which might involve the\r\nultimate necessity of offensive action, and in encouraging legitimate\r\ntrade by every means in our power.' [Sir E. Baring to Consul Cameron,\r\nMarch 14, 1888.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor could scarcely be expected to carry out a policy so much at\r\nvariance with his views and inclinations, and in the summer of 1888\r\nhe was transferred to a purely military appointment and became\r\nAdjutant-General of the Egyptian army. For the next four years he worked\r\nbusily in the War Office at Cairo, effecting many useful reforms and\r\nhard economies, and revealing powers of organisation which, although not\r\nyet appreciated by his comrades in the Egyptian service, were noticed by\r\none vigilant eye. In 1892 Sir F. Grenfell resigned the post of Sirdar,\r\nand the chief command of the Egyptian army was vacant. Two men stood out\r\nprominently as candidates--Colonel Wodehouse, who held the command of\r\nthe Halfa Field Force, and the Adjutant-General. Colonel Wodehouse had\r\nundoubtedly the greater claims. He had been for several years in command\r\nof a large force in continual contact with the enemy. He had won the\r\naction of Argin, and was known throughout the Soudan as 'the conqueror\r\nof Wad-el-Nejumi.' He had conducted the civil administration of the\r\nfrontier province with conspicuous success, and he was popular with all\r\nranks of the Egyptian army. Kitchener had little to set against this. He\r\nhad shown himself a brave and active soldier. He was known to be a good\r\nofficial. But he had not been in accord with the Government in his civil\r\nadministration, and was, moreover, little known to his brother officers.\r\nSir Evelyn Baring's influence, however, turned the scale. Somewhat,\r\ntherefore, to the astonishment of the Egyptian army, Kitchener was\r\npromoted Sirdar. Lord Cromer had found the military officer whom he\r\nconsidered capable of re-conquering the Soudan when the opportunity\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nThe years of preparation, wasted by no one in Egypt, were employed by\r\nno department better than by the Intelligence Branch. The greatest\r\ndisadvantage from which Lord Wolseley had suffered was the general\r\nignorance of the Soudan and its peoples. The British soldiers had had\r\nto learn the details of Dervish fighting by bitter experience. But\r\nthe experience, once gained, was carefully preserved. The Intelligence\r\nBranch of the Egyptian army rose under the direction of Colonel (now\r\nSir Reginald) Wingate to an extraordinary efficiency. For ten years\r\nthe history, climate, geography, and inhabitants of the Soudan were the\r\nobjects of a ceaseless scrutiny. The sharp line between civilisation\r\nand savagery was drawn at Wady Halfa; but beyond that line, up the great\r\nriver, within the great wall of Omdurman, into the arsenal, into the\r\ntreasury, into the mosque, into the Khalifa's house itself, the spies\r\nand secret agents of the Government--disguised as traders, as warriors,\r\nor as women--worked their stealthy way. Sometimes the road by the Nile\r\nwas blocked, and the messengers must toil across the deserts to Darfur,\r\nand so by a tremendous journey creep into Omdurman. At others a trader\r\nmight work his way from Suakin or from the Italian settlements. But by\r\nwhatever route it came, information--whispered at Halfa, catalogued\r\nat Cairo--steadily accumulated, and the diaries of the Intelligence\r\nDepartment grew in weight and number, until at last every important Emir\r\nwas watched and located, every garrison estimated, and even the endless\r\nintrigues and brawls in Omdurman were carefully recorded.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the spies were at length confirmed and amplified by two\r\nmost important witnesses. At the end of 1891 Father Ohrwalder made his\r\nescape from Omdurman and reached the Egyptian territory. Besides giving\r\nthe Intelligence Department much valuable information, he published\r\na thrilling account of his captivity [TEN YEARS' CAPTIVITY, Father\r\nOhrwalder], which created a wide and profound impression in England. In\r\n1895 a still more welcome fugitive reached Assuan. Early on the 16th of\r\nMarch a weary, travel-stained Arab, in a tattered jibba and mounted on\r\na lame and emaciated camel, presented himself to the Commandant. He\r\nwas received with delighted wonder, and forthwith conducted to the best\r\nbath-room available. Two hours later a little Austrian gentleman stepped\r\nforth, and the telegraph hastened to tell the news that Slatin, sometime\r\nGovernor of Darfur, had escaped from the Khalifa's clutches. Here\r\nat last was a man who knew everything that concerned the Dervish\r\nEmpire--Slatin, the Khalifa's trusted and confidential servant, almost\r\nhis friend, who had lived with him, who was even permitted to dine with\r\nhim alone, who had heard all his counsels, who knew all his Emirs, and\r\nmoreover Slatin, the soldier and administrator, who could appreciate\r\nall he had learned, was added with the rank of Pasha to the Staff of\r\nthe Intelligence Department. While his accurate knowledge confirmed the\r\nbelief of the Egyptian authorities that the Dervish power was declining,\r\nhis tale of 'Fire and Sword in the Soudan' increased the horror and\r\nanger of thoughtful people in England at the cruelties of the Khalifa.\r\nPublic opinion began to veer towards the policy of re-conquest.\r\n\r\nThe year 1895 brought in a Conservative and Unionist Administration. A\r\nGovernment came into office supported by a majority which was so strong\r\nthat there seemed little reason to expect a transference of power\r\nfor five or six years. Ministers were likely to be able to carry to\r\na definite conclusion any projects they might devise. They belonged\r\nchiefly to that party in the State which had consistently assailed Mr.\r\nGladstone's Egyptian policy. Here was an opportunity of repairing the\r\ndamage done by their opponents. The comparisons that would follow such\r\nan accomplishment were self-evident and agreeable even to anticipate.\r\nThe idea of re-conquering the Soudan presented itself indefinitely,\r\nbut not unpleasingly, alike to the Government and the people of Great\r\nBritain. The unforeseen course of events crystallised the idea into a\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1896, the battle of Adowa was fought, and Italy at\r\nthe hands of Abyssinia sustained a crushing defeat. Two results followed\r\nwhich affected other nations. First, a great blow had been struck\r\nat European prestige in North Africa. It seemed probable that the\r\nAbyssinian success would encourage the Dervishes to attack the Italians\r\nat Kassala. It was possible that they might also attack the Egyptians at\r\nSuakin or on the Wady Halfa frontier. Secondly, the value of Italy as\r\na factor in European politics was depreciated. The fact that her defeat\r\nhad been assisted by the arms and munitions of war which had been\r\nsupplied to the Abyssinians from French and Russian sources complicated\r\nthe situation. The Triple Alliance was concerned. The third partner had\r\nbeen weakened. The balance might be restored if Great Britain would make\r\nsome open sign of sympathy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the expectations of the Egyptian military authorities were\r\nsoon fulfilled. The Dervishes threatened Kassala as soon as the news of\r\nAdowa reached them, and indeed there were signs of increased activity\r\nin Omdurman itself. In these circumstances the British Government\r\ndetermined to assist Italy by making a demonstration on the Wady Halfa\r\nfrontier. They turned to Egypt. It had always been recognised that the\r\nrecovery of the lost provinces was a natural and legitimate aspiration.\r\n'The doubtful point was to decide the time when the military and\r\nfinancial resources of the country were sufficiently developed to\r\njustify an assumption of the offensive.' [LORD CROMER'S REPORTS: EGYPT,\r\nNo. 2, 1896.] From a purely Egyptian point of view the best possible\r\nmoment had not yet arrived. A few more years of recuperation were\r\nneeded. The country would fight the Soudan campaigns more easily if\r\nfirst refreshed by the great reservoirs which were projected. For more\r\nthan two years both projects had been pressed upon the Government of\r\nhis Highness the Khedive--or, to write definitely, upon Lord Cromer. At\r\nregular intervals Sir Herbert Kitchener and Sir William Garstin would\r\nsuccessively visit the British Agency (it would be treason to call it\r\n'Government House')--the one to urge the case for a war, the other to\r\nplead for a reservoir. The reservoir had won. Only a few weeks before\r\nthe advance to Dongola was ordered Garstin met Kitchener returning from\r\nthe Agency. The engineer inquired the result of the General's interview.\r\n'I'm beaten,' said Kitchener abruptly; 'you've got your dam'--and\r\nGarstin went on his way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the British Government came therefore as a complete\r\nsurprise to the Cairene authorities. The season of the year was\r\nunfavourable to military operations. The hot weather was at hand. The\r\nNile was low. Lord Cromer's report, which had been published in the\r\nearly days of March, had in no way foreshadowed the event. The frontier\r\nwas tranquil. With the exception of a small raid on a village in the\r\nWady Halfa district and an insignificant incursion into the Tokar Delta\r\nthe Dervish forces had during the year maintained 'a strictly defensive\r\nattitude.' [EGYPT, No. 1, 1896.] Lord Cromer, however, realised that\r\nwhile the case for the reservoirs would always claim attention, the\r\nre-conquest of the Soudan might not receive the support of a Liberal\r\nGovernment. The increasing possibility of French intrigues upon the\r\nUpper Nile had also to be considered. All politics are series of\r\ncompromises and bargains, and while the historian may easily mark what\r\nwould have been the best possible moment for any great undertaking,\r\na good moment must content the administrator. Those who guarded the\r\ninterests of Egypt could hardly consent to an empty demonstration on the\r\nWady Halfa frontier at her expense, and the original intention of\r\nthe British Government was at once extended to the re-conquest of the\r\nDongola province--a definite and justifiable enterprise which must in\r\nany case be the first step towards the recovery of the Soudan.\r\n\r\n         *         *         *         *         *         *\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient, before embarking upon the actual chronicle of the\r\nmilitary operations, to explain how the money was obtained to pay for\r\nthe war. I desire to avoid the intricate though fascinating tangles\r\nof Egyptian finance. Yet even when the subject is treated in the\r\nmost general way the difficulties which harass and impede the British\r\nadministrators and insult the sovereign power of Egypt--the mischievous\r\ninterference of a vindictive nation, the galling and almost intolerable\r\nfinancial fetters in which a prosperous country is bound--may arouse in\r\nthe sympathetic reader a flush of annoyance, or at any rate a smile of\r\npitying wonder.\r\n\r\nAbout half the revenue of Egypt is devoted to the development and\r\ngovernment of the country, and the other half to the payment of the\r\ninterest on the debt and other external charges; and, with a view\r\nto preventing in the future the extravagance of the past, the London\r\nConvention in 1885 prescribed that the annual expenditure of Egypt shall\r\nnot exceed a certain sum. When the expenditure exceeds this amount,\r\nfor every pound that is spent on the government or development of Egypt\r\nanother pound must be paid to the Commissioners of the Debt; so that,\r\nafter the limit is reached, for every pound that is required to promote\r\nEgyptian interests two pounds must be raised by taxation from an already\r\nheavily taxed community. But the working of this law was found to be so\r\nsevere that, like all laws which exceed the human conception of justice,\r\nit has been somewhat modified. By an arrangement which was effected in\r\n1888, the Caisse de la Dette are empowered, instead of devoting their\r\nsurplus pound to the sinking fund, to pay it into a general\r\nreserve fund, from which the Commissioners may make grants to meet\r\n'extraordinary expenses'; those expenses, that is to say, which may be\r\nconsidered 'once for all'(capital) expenditure and not ordinary annual\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nThe Dongola expedition was begun, as has been said, without reference\r\nto the immediate internal condition of Egypt. The moment was a good one,\r\nbut not the best. It was obviously impossible for Egypt to provide for\r\nthe extraordinary expenses of the military operations out of revenue.\r\nThe Ministry of Finance therefore appealed to the Caisse de la Dette\r\nfor a grant from the general reserve fund. Here was an obvious case of\r\n'extraordinary expenses.' The Egyptian Government asked for £E500,000.\r\n\r\nThe Caisse met in council. Six Commissioners--representing England,\r\nFrance, Russia, Germany, Austria, and Italy--duly discussed the\r\napplication. Four Commissioners considered that the grant should be\r\nmade. Two Commissioners, those representing France and Russia, voted\r\nagainst it. The majority decided. The grant was made. The money was\r\nhanded to the Egyptian Government and devoted to the prosecution of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nEgypt as a sovereign power had already humbly begged to be allowed to\r\ndevote part of the surplus of her own revenues to her own objects. A\r\ngreater humiliation remained. The Commissioners of France and Russia,\r\nwho had been out-voted, brought an action against their colleagues on\r\nthe grounds that the grant was ultra vires; and against the Egyptian\r\nGovernment for the return of the money thus wrongly obtained. Other\r\nactions were brought at French instigation by various people purporting\r\nto represent the bondholders, who declared that their interests\r\nwere threatened. The case was tried before the Mixed Tribunals, an\r\ninstitution which exists in Egypt superior to and independent of the\r\nsovereign rights of that country.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Egyptian Government and the four Commissioners it was\r\ncontended that the Mixed Tribunals had no competency to try the case;\r\nthat the attacking parties had no right of action; that the Egyptian\r\nGovernment had, in applying, done all that the law of liquidation\r\nrequired; and that the act of sovereignty was complete as soon as the\r\nCaisse, which was the legal representative of the bondholding interest,\r\nhad pronounced its decision.\r\n\r\nThe argument was a strong one; but had it been ten times as strong, the\r\nresult would have been the same. The Mixed Tribunals, an international\r\ninstitution, delivered its judgment on strictly political grounds,\r\nthe judges taking their orders from the different countries they\r\nrepresented. It was solemnly pronounced that war expenses were not\r\n'extraordinary expenses.' The proximate destruction of the Khalifa's\r\npower was treated quite as a matter of everyday occurrence. A state of\r\nwar was apparently regarded as usual in Egypt. On this wise and sensible\r\nground the Egyptian Government were condemned to pay back £E500,000,\r\ntogether with interest and costs. After a momentary hesitation as to\r\nwhether the hour had not come to join issue on the whole subject of\r\nthe financial restrictions of Egypt, it was decided to bow to this\r\niniquitous decision. The money had now to be refunded. It had already\r\nbeen spent. More than that, other sums were needed for the carrying on\r\nof the war. The army was by then occupying Dongola, and was in actual\r\nexpectation of a Dervish counter-attack, and it was evident that\r\nthe military operations could not be suspended or arrested. It was\r\nimpossible to stop; yet without money it seemed impossible to go on;\r\nand, besides, it appeared that Egypt would be unable to repay the\r\n£E500,000 which she had been granted, and of which she was now deprived.\r\n\r\nSuch was the painful and difficult situation which a friendly nation,\r\nin the utmost exercise of her wit and the extreme compass of her legal\r\nrights, had succeeded in producing in a country for whose welfare she\r\nhad always professed an exaggerated regard. Such was the effect of\r\nFrench diplomacy. But there is a Nemesis that waits on international\r\nmalpractices, however cunning. Now, as before and since, the very\r\nastuteness of the French Ministers and agents was to strike a terrible\r\nblow at French interests and French influence in Egypt. At this period\r\nFrance still exercised a considerable force on Egyptian politics. One\r\nEgyptian party, the weaker, but still by no means insignificant, looked\r\ntowards her for support. The news of the French success cheered their\r\nhearts and raised their spirits. Orientals appreciate results. The\r\nresult was a distinct reverse to the British. The conclusion to the\r\nnative mind was obvious. Great Britain had been weighed in the European\r\nbalances and found wanting. In all Eastern countries a large proportion\r\nof the population fluctuates uncertainly, eager only to be on the\r\nwinning side. All this volume of agitation and opinion began to glide\r\nand flow towards the stronger Power, and when the Egyptian Government\r\nfound their appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of\r\nthe Mixed Tribunals to the International Court of Appeal at Alexandria\r\nquashed, and the original decision confirmed, the defeat of the British\r\nwas no less complete than the triumph of the French.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the Consul-General acted. On the 2nd of December he\r\ntelegraphed to Lord Salisbury, reporting the judgment of the Court of\r\nAppeal and asking that he might be 'authorised to state directly that\r\nher Majesty's Government will be prepared to advance the money on\r\nconditions to be hereafter arranged.' The reply was prompt, though\r\nguarded. 'You are authorised,' said Lord Salisbury, 'by the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer to state that though of course the primary liability\r\nfor the payment of the £E500,000 rests with the Egyptian Government,\r\nher Majesty's Government will hold themselves prepared to advance, on\r\nconditions to be decided hereafter, such a sum as they feel satisfied\r\nthat the Egyptian Treasury is powerless to provide.' [The original\r\n£500,000 was afterwards increased to £800,000; which sum was paid by the\r\nBritish Exchequer to the Egyptian Government, at first as a loan, and\r\nlater as a gift.] This obvious development does not seem to have been\r\nforeseen by the French diplomatists, and when, on the 3rd of December,\r\nit was rumoured in Cairo that Great Britain was prepared to pay the\r\nmoney, a great feeling of astonishment and of uncertainty was created.\r\nBut the chances of the French interference proving effective still\r\nseemed good. It was believed that the English Government would not be in\r\na position to make an advance to the Egyptian Government until funds had\r\nbeen voted by Parliament for the purpose. It was also thought that Egypt\r\nwould be utterly unable to find the money immediately. In the meantime\r\nthe position was humiliating. France conceived herself mistress of\r\nthe situation. A complete disillusionment, however, awaited the French\r\nGovernment. The taxes in Egypt, as in other countries, are not collected\r\nevenly over the whole year. During some months there is a large cash\r\nbalance in the Exchequer. In others the money drains in slowly. It\r\nhappened at this period of the year, after the cotton crop had been\r\ngathered, that a considerable balance had accumulated in the Treasury,\r\nand on the guarantee of the English Government being received, to\r\nthe effect that they would ultimately assist Egypt with regard to the\r\nexpenses of the expedition, Lord Cromer determined to repay the money at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe event was foreshadowed. On the 5th of December the Egyptian Council\r\nof Ministers, presided over by the Khedive in person, decided on their\r\nown initiative to despatch an official letter expressing in warm terms\r\ntheir gratitude for the financial help offered them by her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. 'I am desired,' said Boutros Pasha, 'to beg your lordship to\r\nbe good enough to convey to his lordship the Marquess of Salisbury\r\nthe expression of the lively gratitude of the Khedive and the Egyptian\r\nGovernment for the great kindness which her Majesty's Government has\r\nshown to them on this occasion.' [EGYPT, No. 1, 1897.]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December £E500,000, together with £E15,600 interest\r\nand costs, in gold, was conveyed in boxes in a cart from the Egyptian\r\nTreasury to the offices of the Caisse de la Dette. The effect was\r\ntremendous. All Cairo knew of the difficulty. All Cairo witnessed the\r\nmanner in which it had been overcome. The lesson was too plain to be\r\nlost on the native mind. The reverse of the French diplomacy was far\r\ngreater even than its success had appeared. For many years French\r\ninfluence in Egypt had not received so heavy a blow; yet even in the\r\nshort space of time which this story covers it was to receive a still\r\nmore terrible wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly before midnight on the 12th of March, 1896, the Sirdar received\r\ninstructions from Lord Cromer authorising an expedition into the Dongola\r\nprovince and directing him to occupy Akasha. The next morning the news\r\nwas published in the Times, ostensibly as coming from its correspondent\r\nin Cairo: and the Egyptian Cabinet was convened to give a formal assent\r\nby voting the decree. On the 14th the reserves were called out. On the\r\n15th the Khedive reviewed the Cairo garrison; and at the termination of\r\nthe parade Sir H. Kitchener informed him that the earliest battalions\r\nwould start for the front that night.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian frontier force had always been kept in a condition of\r\nimmediate readiness by the restless activity of the enemy. The beginning\r\nof the long-expected advance was hailed with delight by the British\r\nofficers sweltering at Wady Halfa and Sarras. On Sunday, the 15th of\r\nMarch, three days after the Sirdar had received his orders, and before\r\nthe first reinforcements had started from Cairo, Colonel Hunter, who\r\ncommanded on the frontier, formed a small column of all arms to seize\r\nand hold Akasha. At dawn on the 18th the column started, and the actual\r\ninvasion of the territory which for ten years had been abandoned to the\r\nDervishes began. The route lay through a wild and rocky country--the\r\ndebatable ground, desolated by years of war--and the troops straggled\r\ninto a long procession, and had several times for more than an hour to\r\nmove in single file over passes and through narrow defiles strewn with\r\nthe innumerable boulders from which the 'Belly of Stones' has derived\r\nits name. The right of their line of march was protected by the Nile,\r\nand although it was occasionally necessary to leave the bank, to avoid\r\ndifficult ground, the column camped each night by the river. The cavalry\r\nand the Camel Corps searched the country to the south and east; for it\r\nwas expected that the Dervishes would resist the advance. Creeping\r\nalong the bank, and prepared at a moment's notice to stand at bay at\r\nthe water's edge, the small force proceeded on its way. Wady Atira was\r\nreached on the 18th, Tanjore on the 19th, and on the 20th the column\r\nmarched into Akasha.\r\n\r\nThe huts of the mud village were crumbling back into the desert sand.\r\nThe old British fort and a number of storehouses--relics of the Gordon\r\nRelief Expedition--were in ruins. The railway from Sarras had been\r\npulled to pieces. Most of the sleepers had disappeared, but the rails\r\nlay scattered along the track. All was deserted: yet one grim object\r\nproclaimed the Dervish occupation. Beyond the old station and near the\r\nriver a single rail had been fixed nearly upright in the ground. From\r\none of the holes for the fishplate bolts there dangled a rotten cord,\r\nand on the sand beneath this improvised yet apparently effective gallows\r\nlay a human skull and bones, quite white and beautifully polished by\r\nthe action of sun and wind. Half-a-dozen friendly Arabs, who had taken\r\nrefuge on the island below the cataract, were the only inhabitants of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nThe troops began to place themselves in a defensive position without\r\ndelay. On the 22nd the cavalry and Camel Corps returned with the empty\r\nconvoy to Sarras to escort to the front a second and larger column,\r\nunder the command of Major MacDonald, and consisting of the XIth and\r\nXIIth Soudanese, one company of the 3rd Egyptians (dropped as a garrison\r\nat Ambigole Wells), and a heavy convoy of stores numbering six hundred\r\ncamels. Starting from Sarras on the 24th, the column, after four days'\r\nmarching, arrived without accident or attack, and MacDonald assumed\r\ncommand of the whole advanced force.\r\n\r\nAkasha was now converted into a strong entrenched camp, in which an\r\nadvanced base was formed. Its garrison of three battalions, a battery,\r\nand the mounted troops, drew their supplies by camel transport from\r\nSarras. The country to the south and east was continually patrolled, to\r\nguard against a turning movement, and the communications were further\r\nstrengthened by the establishment of fortified posts at Semna, Wady\r\nAtira, and Tanjore. The friendly Arab tribes--Bedouin, Kabbabish,\r\nand Foggara--ranged still more widely in the deserts and occupied the\r\nscattered wells. All this time the Dervishes watched supinely from\r\ntheir position at Fuket, and although they were within a single march\r\nof Akasha they remained inactive and made no attempt to disturb the\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the concentration of the Egyptian army on the frontier was\r\nproceeding. The reservists obeyed the summons to the colours of their\r\nown free will and with gratifying promptness, instead of being tardily\r\ndragged from their homes in chains as in the days of Ismail. All\r\nthe battalions of the army were brought up to war strength. Two new\r\nbattalions of reservists were formed, the 15th and 16th. The 15th was\r\nplaced at Assuan and Korosko on the line of communications. The 16th was\r\ndespatched to Suakin to release the two battalions in garrison there\r\nfor service on the Nile. The 1st Battalion of the North Staffordshire\r\nRegiment was moved up the river from Cairo to take the place of the\r\nWady Halfa garrison of six battalions, which had moved on to Sarras and\r\nAkasha. A Maxim battery of four guns was formed from the machine-gun\r\nsections of the Staffordshires and Connaught Rangers and hurried south.\r\nThe 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Egyptian Battalions from Cairo were passed in\r\na continual succession along the railway and river to the front. In all\r\nthis busy and complicated movement of troops the Egyptian War Office\r\nworked smoothly, and clearly showed the ability with which it was\r\norganised.\r\n\r\nThe line of communications from Cairo, the permanent base, to the\r\nadvanced post at Akasha was 825 miles in length. But of this distance\r\nonly the section lying south of Assuan could be considered as within\r\nthe theatre of war. The ordinary broad-gauge railway ran from Cairo to\r\nBalliana, where a river base was established. From Balliana to Assuan\r\nreinforcements and supplies were forwarded by Messrs. Cook's fleet\r\nof steamers, by barges towed by small tugs, and by a number of native\r\nsailing craft. A stretch of seven miles of railway avoids the First\r\nCataract, and joins Assuan and Shellal. Above Shellal a second flotilla\r\nof gunboats, steamers, barges, and Nile boats was collected to ply\r\nbetween Shellal and Halfa. The military railway ran from Halfa to\r\nSarras. South of Sarras supplies were forwarded by camels. To meet the\r\nincreased demands of transport, 4,500 camels were purchased in Egypt\r\nand forwarded in boats to Assuan, whence they marched via Korosko to\r\nthe front. The British Government had authorised the construction of\r\nthe military railway to Akasha, and a special railway battalion was\r\ncollected at Assuan, through which place sleepers and other material at\r\nonce began to pass to Sarras. The strategic railway construction\r\nwill, however, form the subject of a later chapter, which I shall not\r\nanticipate.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of April, less than three weeks from the commencement of the\r\nadvance, the whole line of communications had been organised and was\r\nworking efficiently, although still crowded with the concentrating\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the 16th Battalion of reservists arrived at Suakin, the IXth\r\nSoudanese were conveyed by transports to Kossier, and marched thence\r\nacross the desert to Kena. The distance was 120 miles, and the fact that\r\nin spite of two heavy thunderstorms--rare phenomena in Egypt--it was\r\ncovered in four days is a notable example of the marching powers of the\r\nblack soldiers. It had been determined that the Xth Soudanese should\r\nfollow at once, but circumstances occurred which detained them on the\r\nRed Sea littoral and must draw the attention of the reader thither.\r\n\r\nThe aspect and history of the town and port of Suakin might afford a\r\nuseful instance to a cynical politician. Most of the houses stand on\r\na small barren island which is connected with the mainland by a narrow\r\ncauseway. At a distance the tall buildings of white coral, often five\r\nstoreys high, present an imposing appearance, and the prominent chimneys\r\nof the condensing machinery--for there is scarcely any fresh water--seem\r\nto suggest manufacturing activity. But a nearer view reveals the\r\nmelancholy squalor of the scene. A large part of the town is deserted.\r\nThe narrow streets wind among tumbled-down and neglected houses. The\r\nquaintly carved projecting windows of the facades are boarded up. The\r\nsoil exhales an odour of stagnation and decay. The atmosphere is\r\nrank with memories of waste and failure. The scenes that meet the eye\r\nintensify these impressions. The traveller who lands on Quarantine\r\nIsland is first confronted with the debris of the projected\r\nSuakin-Berber Railway. Two or three locomotives that have neither felt\r\nthe pressure of steam nor tasted oil for a decade lie rusting in the\r\nruined workshops. Huge piles of railway material rot, unguarded and\r\nneglected, on the shore. Rolling stock of all kinds--carriages, trucks,\r\nvans, and ballast waggons--are strewn or heaped near the sheds. The\r\nChristian cemetery alone shows a decided progress, and the long lines of\r\nwhite crosses which mark the graves of British soldiers and sailors who\r\nlost their lives in action or by disease during the various campaigns,\r\nno less than the large and newly enclosed areas to meet future demands,\r\nincrease the depression of the visitor. The numerous graves of Greek\r\ntraders--a study of whose epitaphs may conveniently refresh a classical\r\neducation--protest that the climate of the island is pestilential. The\r\nhigh loopholed walls declare that the desolate scrub of the mainland is\r\ninhabited only by fierce and valiant savages who love their liberty.\r\n\r\nFor eleven years all trade had been practically stopped, and the only\r\nmerchants remaining were those who carried on an illicit traffic with\r\nthe Arabs or, with Eastern apathy, were content to wait for better\r\ndays. Being utterly unproductive, Suakin had been wisely starved by the\r\nEgyptian Government, and the gloom of the situation was matched by the\r\npoverty of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe island on which the town stands is joined to the mainland by a\r\ncauseway, at the further end of which is an arched gateway of curious\r\ndesign called 'the Gate of the Soudan.' Upon the mainland stands the\r\ncrescent-shaped suburb of El Kaff. It comprises a few mean coral-built\r\nhouses, a large area covered with mud huts inhabited by Arabs and\r\nfishermen, and all the barracks and military buildings. The whole is\r\nsurrounded by a strong wall a mile and a half long, fifteen feet high,\r\nsix feet thick, with a parapet pierced for musketry and strengthened at\r\nintervals by bastions armed with Krupp guns.\r\n\r\nThree strong detached posts complete the defences of Suakin. Ten\r\nmiles to the northward, on the scene of Sir H. Kitchener's unfortunate\r\nenterprise, is the fort of Handub. Tambuk is twenty-five miles inland\r\nand among the hills. Situate upon a high rock, and consisting only of a\r\nstore, a formidable blockhouse, and a lookout tower, this place is safe\r\nfrom any enemy unprovided with artillery. Both Handub and Tambuk were at\r\nthe outset of the campaign provisioned for four months. The third post,\r\nTokar Fort, lies fifty miles along the coast to the south. Its function\r\nis to deprive the Arabs of a base in the fertile delta of the Tokar\r\nriver. The fort is strong, defended by artillery, and requires for its\r\ngarrison an entire battalion of infantry.\r\n\r\nNo description of Suakin would be complete without some allusion to the\r\nman to whom it owes its fame. Osman Digna had been for many years a most\r\nsuccessful and enterprising Arab slave dealer. The attempted suppression\r\nof his trade by the Egyptian Government drove him naturally into\r\nopposition. He joined in the revolt of the Mahdi, and by his influence\r\nroused the whole of the Hadendoa and other powerful tribes of the\r\nRed Sea shore. The rest is upon record. Year after year, at a horrid\r\nsacrifice of men and money, the Imperial Government and the old slaver\r\nfought like wolves over the dry bone of Suakin. Baker's Teb, El Teb,\r\nTamai, Tofrek, Hashin, Handub, Gemaiza, Afafit--such were the fights of\r\nOsman Digna, and through all he passed unscathed. Often defeated, but\r\nnever crushed, the wily Arab might justly boast to have run further and\r\nfought more than any Emir in the Dervish armies.\r\n\r\nIt had scarcely seemed possible that the advance on Dongola could\r\ninfluence the situation around Kassala, yet the course of events\r\nencouraged the belief that the British diversion in favour of Italy had\r\nbeen effective; for at the end of March--as soon, that is to say, as\r\nthe news of the occupation of Akasha reached him--Osman Digna separated\r\nhimself from the army threatening Kassala, and marched with 300 cavalry,\r\n70 camelry, and 2,500 foot towards his old base in the Tokar Delta. On\r\nthe first rumour of his advance the orders of the Xth Soudanese to move\r\nvia Kossier and Kena to the Nile were cancelled, and they remained in\r\ngarrison at Tokar. At home the War Office, touched in a tender spot,\r\nquivered apprehensively, and began forthwith to make plans to strengthen\r\nthe Suakin garrison with powerful forces.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in the Eastern Soudan has always been turbulent.\r\nThe authority of the Governor of the Red Sea Littoral was not at this\r\ntime respected beyond the extreme range of the guns of Suakin. The\r\nHadendoa and other tribes who lived under the walls of the town\r\nprofessed loyalty to the Egyptian Government, not from any conviction\r\nthat their rule was preferable to that of Osman Digna, but simply for\r\nthe sake of a quiet life. As their distance from Suakin increased, the\r\nloyalty of the tribesmen became even less pronounced, and at a radius of\r\ntwenty miles all the Sheikhs oscillated alternately between Osman Digna\r\nand the Egyptian Government, and tried to avoid open hostilities with\r\neither. Omar Tita, Sheikh of the district round about Erkowit, found\r\nhimself situated on this fringe of intriguing neutrality. Although he\r\nwas known to have dealings with Osman, it was believed that if he had\r\nthe power to choose he would side with the Egyptian Government. Early\r\nin April Omar Tita reported that Osman Digna was in the neighbourhood\r\nof Erkowit with a small force, and that he, the faithful ally of the\r\nGovernment, had on the 3rd of the month defeated him with a loss of four\r\ncamels. He also said that if the Egyptian Government would send up a\r\nforce to fight Osman, he, the aforesaid ally, would keep him in play\r\nuntil it arrived.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of hesitation and telegraphic communication with the\r\nSirdar, Colonel Lloyd, the Governor of Suakin, who was then in very bad\r\nhealth, decided that he had not enough troops to justify him in taking\r\nthe risk of going up to Erkowit to fight Osman. Around Suakin, as along\r\nthe Indian frontier, a battle was always procurable on the shortest\r\nnotice. When a raid has taken place, the Government may choose the scale\r\nof their reprisals. If they are poor, they will arrange a counter-raid\r\nby means of 'friendlies,' and nothing more will be heard of the affair.\r\nIf they are rich, they will mobilise two or three brigades, and make an\r\nexpedition or fight a pitched battle, so that another glory may be added\r\nto the annals of the British army. In the present instance the Egyptian\r\nGovernment were poor, and as the British Government did not desire to\r\nprofit by the opportunity it was determined to have only a small-scale\r\noperation. The Governor therefore arranged a plan for a demonstration\r\nat the foot of the hills near Khor Wintri by means of combined movements\r\nfrom Suakin and Tokar. The garrison of Suakin consisted of the 1st and\r\nhalf the 5th Egyptian Battalions; the 16th Egyptian reservists, who had\r\njust replaced the IXth Soudanese, and were as yet hardly formed into a\r\nmilitary body; one squadron of cavalry, one company of Camel Corps, and\r\nsome detachments of artillery. The garrison of Tokar consisted of the\r\nXth Soudanese and a few gunners. From these troops there was organised\r\nin the second week in April, with all due ceremony, a 'Suakin Field\r\nForce.'\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign was simple. Colonel Lloyd was to march out from\r\nSuakin and effect a junction with the 'Tokar Column' at Khor Wintri,\r\nwhere the Erkowit road enters the hills. It was then hoped that Osman\r\nDigna would descend and fight a battle of the required dimensions in the\r\nopen; after which, if victorious, the force would return to Suakin and\r\nTokar.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the Suakin Column as mobile as possible, the\r\nwhole force was mounted on camels, of which more than 1,000 were\r\nrequisitioned, as well as 60 mules and 120 donkeys. Two hundred Arabs\r\naccompanied the column to hold these beasts when necessary. Six days'\r\nforage and rations, one day's reserve of water, 200 rounds per man,\r\nand 100 shell per gun were carried. At five o'clock on the afternoon\r\nof Tuesday, the 14th of April, the troops paraded outside the walls of\r\nSuakin, and bivouacked in the open ready to march at daylight.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the column, which numbered about 1,200 men of all arms,\r\nstarted. After marching for four or five hours in the direction of Khor\r\nWintri the cavalry, who covered the advance, came in contact with the\r\nDervish scouts. The force thereupon assumed an oblong formation: the\r\nmixed Soudanese company and the two guns in front, three Egyptian\r\ncompanies on each flank, the Camel Corps company in the rear, and the\r\ntransport in the centre. The pace was slow, and, since few of the camels\r\nhad ever been saddled or ridden, progress was often interrupted by\r\ntheir behaviour and by the broken and difficult nature of the country.\r\nNevertheless at about four o'clock in the afternoon, Teroi Wells, eight\r\nmiles from Khor Wintri, were reached; and here, having marched nineteen\r\nmiles, Colonel Lloyd determined to halt. While the infantry were making\r\nthe zeriba, the cavalry were sent on under Captain Fenwick (an infantry\r\nofficer employed on the Staff) to gain touch with the Tokar force, who\r\nwere expected to have already reached the rendezvous. Apparently under\r\nthe belief that Omar Tita and his Arabs would give timely notice of\r\nan attack, the cavalry seem to have neglected many of the usual\r\nprecautions, and in consequence at about five o'clock, when approaching\r\nKhor Wintri, they found themselves suddenly confronted with a force of\r\nabout 200 Dervish horsemen supported by a large body of infantry. The\r\nsquadron wheeled about with promptitude, and began to retire at a\r\ntrot. The Dervish horsemen immediately pursued. The result was that the\r\nEgyptians began a disorderly flight at a gallop through the thick and\r\ntreacherous scrub and over broken, dangerous ground. Sixteen horses\r\nfell; their riders were instantly speared by the pursuers. Rallying\r\nthirty-eight troopers, Captain Fenwick seized a rocky hillock, and\r\ndismounting with the natural instinct of an infantry soldier, prepared\r\nto defend himself to the last. The remainder of the squadron continued\r\ntheir flight, and thirty-two troopers, under an Egyptian officer (whose\r\nhorse is said to have bolted), arrived at the Teroi zeriba with the\r\nnews that their comrades had been destroyed, or had perhaps 'returned\r\nto Suakin,' and that they themselves had been closely followed by the\r\nenemy. The news caused the gravest anxiety, which was not diminished\r\nwhen it was found that the bush around the zeriba was being strongly\r\noccupied by Dervish spearmen. Two mounted men, who volunteered for the\r\nperilous duty, were sent to make their way through this savage cordon,\r\nand try to find either the remainder of the cavalry or the Tokar Column.\r\nBoth were hunted down and killed. The rest of the force continued in\r\nhourly expectation of an attack.\r\n\r\nTheir suspense was aggravated towards midnight, when the Dervishes began\r\nto approach the zeriba. In the darkness what was thought to be a body of\r\nhorsemen was seen moving along a shallow khor opposite the right face of\r\nthe defence. At the same moment a loud yell was raised by the enemy on\r\nthe other side. An uncontrolled musketry fire immediately broke out. The\r\nguns fired blindly up the valley; the infantry wildly on all sides. The\r\nfusillade continued furiously for some time, and when by the efforts of\r\nthe British officers the troops were restrained, it was found that\r\nthe Dervishes had retired, leaving behind them a single wounded man.\r\nOccasional shots were fired from the scrub until the morning, but no\r\nfresh attack was attempted by the Dervishes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Fenwick maintained his solitary and perilous position\r\non the hillock. He was soon surrounded by considerable bodies of the\r\nenemy, and as soon as it became dark he was sharply attacked. But\r\nthe Dervishes fortunately possessed few rifles, and the officers and\r\ntroopers, by firing steady volleys, succeeded in holding their ground\r\nand repulsing them. The sound of the guns at Teroi encouraged the\r\nEgyptians and revealed the direction of their friends. With the daylight\r\nthe Dervishes, who seem throughout the affair to have been poor-spirited\r\nfellows, drew off, and the detachment, remounting, made haste to rejoin\r\nthe main body.\r\n\r\nThe force, again united, pursued their way to Khor Wintri, where they\r\nfound the column from Tokar already arrived. Marching early on the\r\n15th, Major Sidney with 250 men of the Xth Soudanese, the only really\r\ntrustworthy troops in the force, had reached Khor Wintri the same\r\nafternoon. He drove out the small Dervish post occupying the khor, and\r\nwas about to bivouac, when he was sharply attacked by a force of Arabs\r\nsaid to have numbered 80 horsemen and 500 foot. The Soudanese fought\r\nwith their usual courage, and the Dervishes were repulsed, leaving\r\nthirty dead upon the ground. The regulars had three men wounded.\r\n\r\nUp to this point Colonel Lloyd's plan had been successfully carried out.\r\nThe columns from Suakin and Tokar had effected a junction at Khor Wintri\r\non the Erkowit road. It now remained to await the attack of Osman Digna,\r\nand inflict a heavy blow upon him. It was decided, however, in view\r\nof what had occurred, to omit this part of the scheme, and both forces\r\nreturned together without delay to Suakin, which they reached on the\r\n18th, having lost in the operations eighteen Egyptian soldiers killed\r\nand three wounded.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival terminated a period of anxious doubt as to their fate.\r\nThe town, which had been almost entirely denuded of troops, was left in\r\ncharge of Captain Ford-Hutchinson. At about two o'clock in the afternoon\r\nof the 16th a few stragglers from the Egyptian cavalry with half-a-dozen\r\nriderless horses knocked at the gates, and vague but sinister rumours\r\nspread on all sides. The belief that a disaster had overtaken the\r\nEgyptian force greatly excited the Arabs living within the walls, and\r\nit appeared that they were about to rise, plunder the town, and massacre\r\nthe Christians. Her Majesty's ship Scout was, however, by good fortune\r\nin the harbour. Strong parties of bluejackets were landed to patrol the\r\nstreets. The guns of the warship were laid on the Arab quarter. These\r\nmeasures had a tranquillising effect, and order reigned in Suakin until\r\nthe return of the Field Force, when their victory was celebrated with\r\nappropriate festivities.\r\n\r\nIt was announced that as a result of the successful operations the\r\nDervish enterprise against the Tokai Delta had collapsed, and that\r\nOsman Digna's power was for ever broken. In order, however, that no\r\nunfortunate incident should mar the triumph, the Xth Soudanese were sent\r\nback to Tokar by sea via Trinkitat, instead of marching direct and the\r\ngarrison of Suakin confined themselves henceforward strictly to their\r\ndefences. Osman Digna remained in the neighbourhood and raided the\r\nfriendly villages. On the arrival of the Indian contingent he was\r\nsupposed to be within twelve miles of the town, but thereafter he\r\nretired to Adarama on the Atbara river, where he remained during the\r\nDongola campaign. The fact that no further offensive operations were\r\nundertaken in the Eastern Soudan prevented all fighting, for the\r\nDervishes were, of course, unable to assail the strong permanent\r\nfortifications behind which the Egyptians took shelter. They\r\nnevertheless remained in actual possession of the surrounding country,\r\nuntil the whole situation was altered by the successful advance of\r\npowerful forces behind them along the Nile and by the occupation of\r\nBerber.\r\n\r\nAfter the affair of Khor Wintri it was evident that it would not be\r\npossible to leave Suakin to the defence only of the 16th Battalion of\r\nreservists. On the other hand, Sir H. Kitchener required every soldier\r\nthe Egyptian army could muster to carry out the operations on the Nile.\r\nIt was therefore determined to send Indian troops to Suakin to garrison\r\nthe town and forts, and thus release the Xth Soudanese and the Egyptian\r\nbattalions for the Dongola Expedition. Accordingly early in the month of\r\nMay the Indian Army authorities were ordered to prepare a brigade of all\r\narms for service in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe troops selected were as follow: 26th Bengal Infantry, 35th Sikhs,\r\n1st Bombay Lancers, 5th Bombay Mountain Battery, two Maxim guns, one\r\nsection Queen's Own (Madras) Sappers and Miners--in all about 4,000 men.\r\nThe command was entrusted to Colonel Egerton, of the Corps of Guides.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of May the dreary town of Suakin was enlivened by the\r\narrival of the first detachments, and during the following week the\r\nwhole force disembarked at the rotten piers and assumed the duties of\r\nthe defence. It is mournful to tell how this gallant brigade, which\r\nlanded so full of high hope and warlike enthusiasm, and which was\r\ncertainly during the summer the most efficient force in the Soudan, was\r\nreduced in seven months to the sullen band who returned to India wasted\r\nby disease, embittered by disappointment, and inflamed by feelings of\r\nresentment and envy.\r\n\r\nThe Indian contingent landed in the full expectation of being\r\nimmediately employed against the enemy. After a week, when all the\r\nstores had been landed, officers and men spent their time speculating\r\nwhen the order to march would come. It was true that there was no\r\ntransport in Suakin, but that difficulty was easily overcome by rumours\r\nthat 5,000 camels were on their way from the Somali coast to enable the\r\nforce to move on Kassala or Berber. As these did not arrive, General\r\nEgerton sent in a proposed scheme to the Sirdar, in which he undertook\r\nto hold all the advanced posts up to the Kokreb range, if he were\r\nsupplied with 1,000 camels for transport. A characteristic answer was\r\nreturned, to the effect that it was not intended to use the Indian\r\ncontingent as a mobile force. They had come as a garrison for Suakin,\r\nand a garrison for Suakin they should remain. This information was not,\r\nhowever, communicated to the troops, who continued to hope for orders to\r\nadvance until the fall of Dongola.\r\n\r\nThe heat when the contingent arrived was not great, but as the months\r\nwore on the temperature rose steadily, until in August and September the\r\nthermometer rarely fell below 103° during the night, and often rose\r\nto 115° by day. Dust storms were frequent. A veritable plague of flies\r\ntormented the unhappy soldiers. The unhealthy climate, the depressing\r\ninactivity, and the scantiness of fresh meat or the use of condensed\r\nwater, provoked an outbreak of scurvy. At one time nearly all the\r\nfollowers and 50 per cent of the troops were affected. Several\r\nlarge drafts were invalided to India. The symptoms were painful and\r\ndisgusting--open wounds, loosening of the teeth, curious fungoid growths\r\non the gums and legs. The cavalry horses and transport animals suffered\r\nfrom bursati, and even a pinprick expanded into a large open sore. It is\r\ndoubtful whether the brigade could have been considered fit for active\r\nservice after September. All the Europeans suffered acutely from prickly\r\nheat. Malarial fever was common. There were numerous cases of abscess on\r\nthe liver. Twenty-five per cent of the British officers were invalided\r\nto England or India, and only six escaped a stay in hospital. The\r\nexperiences of the battalion holding Tokar Fort were even worse\r\nthan those of the troops in Suakin. At length the longed-for time\r\nof departure arrived. With feelings of relief and delight the Indian\r\ncontingent shook the dust of Suakin off their feet and returned to\r\nIndia. It is a satisfaction to pass from the dismal narrative of events\r\nin the Eastern Soudan to the successful campaign on the Nile.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of April the concentration on the frontier was completed.\r\nThe communications were cleared of their human freight, and occupied\r\nonly by supplies and railway material, which continued to pour south at\r\nthe utmost capacity of the transport. Eleven thousand troops had been\r\nmassed at and beyond Wady Halfa. But no serious operations could take\r\nplace until a strong reserve of stores had been accumulated at the\r\nfront. Meanwhile the army waited, and the railway grew steadily. The\r\nbattalions were distributed in three principal fortified camps--Halfa,\r\nSarras, and Akasha--and detachments held the chain of small posts which\r\nlinked them together.\r\n\r\nIncluding the North Staffordshire Regiment, the garrison of Wady Halfa\r\nnumbered about 3,000 men. The town and cantonment, nowhere more than 400\r\nyards in width, straggle along the river-bank, squeezed in between the\r\nwater and the desert, for nearly three miles. The houses, offices, and\r\nbarracks are all built of mud, and the aspect of the place is brown and\r\nsqualid. A few buildings, however, attain to the dignity of two storeys.\r\nAt the northern end of the town a group of fairly well-built houses\r\noccupy the river-front, and a distant view of the clusters of\r\npalm-trees, of the white walls, and the minaret of the mosque refreshes\r\nthe weary traveller from Korosko or Shellal with the hopes of civilised\r\nentertainment. The whole town is protected towards the deserts by a\r\nditch and mud wall; and heavy Krupp field-pieces are mounted on little\r\nbastions where the ends of the rampart rest upon the river. Five small\r\ndetached forts strengthen the land front, and the futility of an Arab\r\nattack at this time was evident. Halfa had now become the terminus of\r\na railway, which was rapidly extending; and the continual arrival and\r\ndespatch of tons of material, the building of sheds, workshops, and\r\nstorehouses lent the African slum the bustle and activity of a civilised\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nSarras Fort is an extensive building, perched on a crag of black rock\r\nrising on the banks of the Nile about thirty miles south of Halfa.\r\nDuring the long years of preparation it had been Egypt's most advanced\r\noutpost and the southern terminus of the military railway. The beginning\r\nof the expedition swelled it into an entrenched camp, holding nearly\r\n6,000 men. From each end of the black rock on which the fort stood a\r\nstrong stone wall and wire entanglement ran back to the river. The space\r\nthus enclosed was crowded with rows of tents and lines of animals and\r\nhorses; and in the fort Colonel Hunter, commanding the district known as\r\n'Sarras and the South,' had his headquarters.\r\n\r\nFrom Sarras the army seemed to have chosen a double line of advance. The\r\nrailway reconstruction followed the old track which had been prepared\r\nthrough the desert in 1885. The convoy route wound along by the river.\r\nBoth were protected from attack. The 7th Egyptians guarded Railhead,\r\nwhile the chain of small posts secured the road by the Nile to Akasha.\r\nThe advanced base grew during the months of April and May into a strong\r\nposition. Only once did the Arabs venture to approach within artillery\r\nrange. A small body of horse and camel men made a sort of haphazard\r\nreconnaissance, and, being seen from the outpost line, were fired on at\r\na great distance by a field-gun. They fell back immediately, but it was\r\nbelieved that the range was too great for the projectile to have harmed\r\nthem; and it was not until two days later that the discovery on the\r\nspot of a swollen, blistering corpse, clad in bright jibba, apprised the\r\ndelighted gunners of the effect of their fire. Warned by this lucky shot\r\nthe Dervishes came no more, or came unseen.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar, accompanied by Colonel Bundle, his Chief of Staff, had left\r\nCairo on the 22nd of March, and after a short stay at Assuan reached\r\nWady Halfa on the 29th. Here he remained during the month of April,\r\nsuperintending and pressing the extension of the railroad and the\r\naccumulation of supplies. On the 1st of May he arrived at Akasha, with\r\na squadron of cavalry, under Major Burn-Murdoch, as his escort. It\r\nhappened that a convoy had come in the previous day, so that there were\r\ntwo extra cavalry squadrons at the advanced post. Almost at the same\r\nmoment that Sir H. Kitchener entered the camp, a party of friendly Arabs\r\ncame in with the news that they had been surprised some four miles to\r\nthe eastward by a score of Dervish camel-men, and had only succeeded in\r\nescaping with the loss of two of their number. In the belief that the\r\nenemy in the immediate vicinity were not in force, the Sirdar ordered\r\nthe three squadrons of Egyptian cavalry, supported by the XIth\r\nSoudanese, to go out and reconnoitre towards Firket and endeavour to cut\r\noff any hostile patrols that might be found.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock Major Burn-Murdoch started with four British officers and\r\n240 lances. After moving for seven or eight miles among the hills\r\nwhich surround Akasha, the cavalry passed through a long, sandy defile,\r\nflanked on either side by rocky peaks and impracticable ravines. As the\r\nhead of the column was about to debouch from this, the advanced scouts\r\nreported that there was a body of Dervishes in the open ground in front\r\nof the defile. The cavalry commander rode forward to look at them,\r\nand found himself confronted, not, as he had expected, by a score of\r\ncamel-men, but by a strong force of Dervishes, numbering at least 1,500\r\nfoot and 250 horse. The cavalry, by trotting, had left the supporting\r\ninfantry some distance behind them. The appearance of the enemy was\r\nthreatening. The horsemen, who were drawn up scarcely 300 yards away,\r\nwere already advancing to the attack, their right flank protected by a\r\nsmall force of camelry; and behind was the solid array of the spearmen.\r\n\r\nMajor Burn-Murdoch determined to fall back on his infantry support and\r\nescape from the bad ground. He gave the order, and the squadrons\r\nwheeled about by troops and began to retire. Forthwith the Dervish horse\r\ncharged, and, galloping furiously into the defile, attacked the cavalry\r\nin rear. Both sides were crowded in the narrow space. The wildest\r\nconfusion followed, and the dust raised by the horses' hoofs hung over\r\nall like a yellow London fog, amid which the bewildered combatants\r\ndischarged their pistols and thrust at random. The Egyptian cavalry,\r\nthus highly tried, showed at first no disposition to turn to meet the\r\nattack. The tumult drowned all words of command. A disaster appeared\r\nimminent. But the British officers, who had naturally been at the head\r\nof the column during its advance, were now at the rear and nearest the\r\nenemy. Collecting a score of troopers, they made such resistance with\r\ntheir swords and revolvers that they actually held the defile and beat\r\nback the Dervish horse, who retired on their infantry, leaving a dozen\r\ndead upon the ground. Two of the Egyptian squadrons continued to retreat\r\nuntil clear of the defile, a distance of 700 yards; but the third and\r\nrearmost was compelled by the British officers to face about, and,\r\ngalloping with this force down the ravine, Major Burn-Murdoch drove the\r\nArabs pell-mell out of it. The other two squadrons had now returned,\r\nand the whole force dismounted, and, taking up a position among the\r\nsandhills near the mouth of the defile, opened fire with their carbines.\r\nThe repulse of their cavalry seemed to have disheartened the Dervishes,\r\nfor they made no attempt to attack the dismounted troopers, and\r\ncontented themselves with maintaining a desultory fire, which was so\r\nill-aimed that but little loss was caused. The heat of the weather was\r\nterrific, and both men and horses suffered acutely from thirst. The\r\nsquadron which had escorted the Sirdar had performed a long march before\r\nthe reconnaissance and was exhausted. The cavalry, however, held their\r\nposition among the sandhills and easily defeated a feeble attempt to\r\nturn their right. At a quarter past twelve the Dervishes began to retire\r\nslowly and deliberately, and by one o'clock, when the XIth Soudanese\r\narrived, eager and agog, the last Arab had disappeared. The force then\r\nreturned to camp, bearing many spears and leading six captured horses as\r\ntrophies of victory. The intensity of the heat may be gauged by the\r\nfact that one of the Soudanese soldiers--that is to say, an African\r\nnegro--died of sunstroke. Such was the affair of the 1st of May, and it\r\nis pleasing to relate that in this fierce fight the loss was not severe.\r\nOne British officer, Captain Fitton, was slightly wounded. One native\r\nsoldier was killed; one was mortally and eight severely wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring May the preparations for the advance on the Dervish position at\r\nFirket continued, and towards the end of the month it became evident\r\nthat they were nearly complete. The steady accumulation of stores at\r\nAkasha had turned that post into a convenient base from which the force\r\nmight operate for a month without drawing supplies of any kind from the\r\nnorth. The railway, which had progressed at the rate of about half\r\na mile a day, had reached and was working to Ambigole Wells, where a\r\nfour-gun fort and entrenchment had been built. The distance over which\r\nconvoys must plod was reduced by half, and the business of supply was\r\ndoubly accelerated. By degrees the battalions and squadrons began to\r\nmove forward towards Akasha. Sarras, deprived of its short-lived glory,\r\nbecame again the solitary fort on a crag. Wady Halfa was also deserted,\r\nand, except for the British battalion in garrison, could scarcely boast\r\na soldier. Both the Egyptian battalions from Suakin had arrived on the\r\nNile. The Xth Soudanese were on their way. The country beyond Akasha\r\nhad been thoroughly reconnoitred and mapped to within three miles of the\r\nDervish position. Everything was ready.\r\n\r\nThe actual concentration may be said to have begun on the 1st of\r\nJune, when the Sirdar started for the front from Halfa, whither he had\r\nreturned after the cavalry skirmish. Construction work on the railway\r\ncame to a full stop. The railway battalions, dropping their picks and\r\nshovels, shouldered their Remington rifles and became the garrisons\r\nof the posts on the line of communications. On the 2nd of June the\r\ncorrespondents were permitted to proceed to Akasha. On the 3rd the Xth\r\nSoudanese passed through Ambigole and marched south. The Horse battery\r\nfrom Halfa followed. The Egyptian battalions and squadrons which had\r\nbeen camped along the river at convenient spots from Ambigole to Akasha\r\nmarched to a point opposite Okma. Between this place and the advanced\r\npost an extensive camp, stretching three miles along the Nile bank,\r\narose with magic swiftness. On the 4th the 7th Egyptians moved from\r\nRailhead, and with these the last battalion reached the front. Nine\r\nthousand men, with ample supplies, were collected within striking\r\ndistance of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Dervishes at Firket watched in senseless apathy the\r\ndeliberate, machine-like preparations for their destruction. They should\r\nhave had good information, for although the Egyptian cavalry patrolled\r\nceaselessly, and the outpost line was impassable to scouts, their spies,\r\nas camel-drivers, water-carriers, and the like, were in the camp. They\r\nmay not, perhaps, have known the exact moment of the intended blow, for\r\nthe utmost secrecy was observed. But though they must have realised that\r\nit was imminent, they did nothing. There was, indeed, no course open\r\nto them but retreat. Once the army was concentrated with sufficient\r\nsupplies at Akasha, their position was utterly untenable. The\r\nEmir-in-Chief, Hammuda, then had scarcely 3,000 men around his flag.\r\nTheir rifles and ammunition were bad; their supplies scanty. Nor could\r\nthe valour of fifty-seven notable Emirs sustain the odds against them.\r\nThere was still time to fall back on Kosheh, or even on Suarda--anywhere\r\noutside the sweep of their terrible enemy's sword. They would not budge.\r\nObstinate and fatuous to the last, they dallied and paltered on the\r\nfatal ground, until sudden, blinding, inevitable catastrophe fell\r\nupon them from all sides at once, and swept them out of existence as a\r\nmilitary force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: FIRKET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 7, 1896\r\n\r\nSince the end of 1895 the Dervish force in Firket had been under the\r\ncommand of the Emir Hammuda, and it was through the indolence and\r\nneglect of this dissipated Arab that the Egyptian army had been able to\r\nmake good its position at Akasha without any fighting. Week after week\r\nthe convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country\r\nbetween Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon\r\nthe brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its\r\ncommunications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad\r\nBishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in\r\nsupreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly\r\nany means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations,\r\nhowever, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor\r\nraids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was\r\nseveral times reconnoitred.\r\n\r\nBishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing\r\nenergy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede\r\nhim. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and\r\ndevoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For\r\nmany years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire,\r\nand his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver\r\nof the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the\r\nwretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all\r\nhope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His\r\ncrafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at\r\nFirket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction\r\nto the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.\r\n\r\nWhether Osman Azrak had actually assumed command on the 6th of June\r\nis uncertain. It seems more likely that Hammuda declined to admit his\r\nright, and that the matter still stood in dispute. But in any case Osman\r\nwas determined to justify his appointment by his activity, and about\r\nmidday he started from the camp at Firket, and, accompanied by a strong\r\npatrol of camel-men, set out to reconnoitre Akasha. Moving cautiously,\r\nhe arrived unperceived within sight of the position at about three\r\no'clock in the afternoon. The columns which were to storm Firket at dawn\r\nwere then actually parading. But the clouds of dust which the high\r\nwind drove across or whirled about the camp obscured the view, and\r\nthe Dervish could distinguish nothing unusual. He therefore made the\r\ncustomary pentagonal mark on the sand to ensure good luck, and so\r\nreturned to Firket to renew his dispute with Hammuda, bearing the\r\nreassuring news that 'the Turks lay quiet.'\r\n\r\nThe force which the Sirdar had concentrated for the capture of Firket\r\namounted to about nine thousand men, and was organised as follows:--\r\n\r\n                Commander-in-Chief: THE SIRDAR\r\n\r\n       The Infantry Division: COLONEL HUNTER Commanding\r\n\r\n 1st Brigade           2nd Brigade            3rd Brigade\r\n Major LEWIS           MAJOR MACDONALD        MAJOR MAXWELL\r\n 3rd Egyptians         IXth Soudanese         2nd Egyptians\r\n 4th     \"             XIth     \"             7th     \"\r\n Xth Soudanese         XIIth    \"             8th     \"\r\n                       XIIIth   \"\r\n\r\n       Mounted Forces: MAJOR BURN-MURDOCH\r\n\r\n Egyptian Cavalry.... 7 squadrons\r\n Camel Corps. .... 8 companies\r\n\r\n                  Artillery\r\n\r\n Horse Artillery .... 1 battery\r\n Field Artillery .... 2 batteries\r\n Maxim Guns . .... 1 battery\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo roads led from Akasha to Firket--one by the bank of the river, the\r\nother inland and along the projected railway line. The Sirdar determined\r\nto avail himself of both. The force was therefore divided into two\r\ncolumns. The main column, under command of the Sirdar, was to move\r\nby the river road, and consisted of the infantry division, the Field\r\nArtillery, and the Maxim guns. The Desert Column, under command of Major\r\nBurn-Murdoch, consisted of the mounted forces, the Horse Artillery, and\r\none battalion of infantry (the XIIth Soudanese) drawn from MacDonald's\r\nbrigade and mounted upon camels: in all about two thousand men. Very\r\nprecise orders were given to the smaller column, and Burn-Murdoch was\r\ninstructed to occupy the hills to the south-east of the centre of Firket\r\nvillage by 4.30 A.M.; to dispose his force facing west, with the cavalry\r\non the left, the Camel Corps in the centre, and the XIIth Soudanese on\r\nthe right. The only point left to his discretion was the position to\r\nbe occupied by the Horse battery. He was especially warned not to come\r\nunder the fire of the main infantry force. As soon as the enemy should\r\nbe routed, the XIIth Soudanese were to return to the Sirdar. The\r\ncavalry, camelry, and Horse Artillery were to pursue--the objective\r\nbeing, firstly, Koyeka, and, secondly, Suarda.\r\n\r\nThe infantry column began to march out of Akasha at 3.30 in the\r\nafternoon of the 6th, and trailed southwards along the track by the\r\nriver in the following order: Lewis's brigade, with the Xth Soudanese\r\nleading; two Maxim guns and the artillery; MacDonald's brigade;\r\nMaxwell's brigade; and, lastly, the field hospitals and a half-battalion\r\nforming rearguard. The Sirdar marched behind the artillery. The rear of\r\nthe long column was clear of the camp by 4.30, and about two hours later\r\nthe mounted force started by the desert road. The River Column made good\r\nprogress till dark, but thereafter the advance was slow and tedious. The\r\ntrack led through broken rocky ground, and was so narrow that it nowhere\r\nallowed a larger front to be formed than of four men abreast. In some\r\nplaces the sharp rocks and crumbling heaps of stone almost stopped the\r\ngun-mules altogether, while the infantry tripped and stumbled painfully.\r\nThe moon had not risen, and the darkness was intense. Still the long\r\nprocession of men, winding like a whiplash between the jagged hills,\r\ntoiled onward through the night, with no sound except the tramping\r\nof feet and the rattle of accoutrements. At half-past ten the head of\r\nLewis's brigade debouched into a smooth sandy plain about a mile to the\r\nnorth of Sarkamatto village. This was the spot--scarcely three miles\r\nfrom the enemy's position--where the Sirdar had decided to halt and\r\nbivouac. The bank and foreshore of the river were convenient for\r\nwatering; all bottles and skins were filled, and soldiers and animals\r\ndrank. A little food was eaten, and then, battalion by battalion, as the\r\nforce arrived at the halting-place, they lay down to rest. The tail\r\nof Maxwell's brigade reached the bivouac about midnight, and the whole\r\ncolumn was then concentrated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mounted force were also on their way. Like the River\r\nColumn, they were disordered by the broken ground, and the XIIth\r\nSoudanese, who were unused to camel riding and mounted only on transport\r\nsaddles, were soon wearied. After one o'clock many men, both in the\r\nCamel Corps and in the battalion, fell asleep on their camels, and the\r\nofficers had great difficulty in keeping them awake. However, the\r\nforce reached their point of concentration--about three miles to the\r\nsouth-east of Firket--at a quarter to three. Here the XIIth Soudanese\r\ndismounted from their camels and became again a fighting unit. Leaving\r\nthe extra camels under a guard, Major Burn-Murdoch then advanced towards\r\nhis appointed position on the hills overlooking Firket.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar moved on again with the infantry at 2.30. The moon had risen\r\nover the rocks to the left of the line of march, but it was only a thin\r\ncrescent and did not give much light. The very worst part of the whole\r\ntrack was encountered immediately the bivouac was left, and the column\r\nof nearly six thousand men had to trickle through one narrow place\r\nin single file. There were already signs of the approach of dawn; the\r\nDervish camp was near; the Sirdar and his Staff began to look anxious.\r\nHe sent many messages to the leading battalions to hurry; and the\r\nsoldiers, although now very weary, ran and scrambled through the\r\ndifficult passage like sheep crowding through a gate. By four o'clock\r\nthe leading brigade had cleared the obstacle, and the most critical\r\nmoment seemed to have passed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a mile to the southward, rose the sound of the beating of\r\ndrums. Everyone held his breath. The Dervishes were prepared. Perhaps\r\nthey would attack the column before it could deploy. Then the sound\r\ndied away, and but for the clatter of the marching columns all was again\r\nsilent. It was no alarm, but only the call to the morning prayer; and\r\nthe Dervishes, still ignorant that their enemies approached and that\r\nswift destruction was upon them, trooped from their huts to obey the\r\npious summons.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of Firket mountain, still dark in the half-light, now\r\nrose up on the left of the line of march. Between it and the river\r\nstretched a narrow strip of scrub-covered ground; and here, though\r\nobstructed by the long grass, bushes, palm-trees, and holes, the leading\r\nbrigade was ordered to deploy. There was, however, as yet only room for\r\nthe Xth Soudanese to form line, and the 3rd and 4th Egyptians contented\r\nthemselves with widening to column of companies--the 3rd in rear of the\r\nright of the Xth, the 4th in rear of the centre. The force now began\r\nto emerge from the narrow space between the hills and the river, and\r\ndebouch into open country. As the space widened No. 1 field battery came\r\ninto line on the left, and No. 2 On the right of the Xth Soudanese. A\r\nswell of ground hid Firket village, though it was known to be within\r\na mile, and it was now daylight. Still there was no sign that the\r\nDervishes were prepared. It seemed scarcely possible to believe that the\r\nadvance had not yet been discovered. The silence seemed to forbode some\r\nunexpected attack. The leading brigade and guns halted for a few minutes\r\nto allow MacDonald to form his battalions from 'fours' into column of\r\ncompanies. Then at five o'clock the advance was resumed, and at this\r\nmoment from the shoulder of Firket mountain there rang out a solitary\r\nshot. The Dervish outposts had at last learned their danger. Several\r\nother shots followed in quick succession, and were answered by a volley\r\nfrom the Xth, and then from far away to the south-east came the report\r\nof a field-gun. The Horse Artillery battery had come into action. The\r\noperation of the two columns was simultaneous: the surpise of the enemy\r\nwas complete.\r\n\r\nThe great object was now to push on and deploy as fast as possible.\r\nThe popping of musketry broke out from many points, and the repeated\r\nexplosions of the Horse battery added to the eager excitement of the\r\ntroops. For what is more thrilling than the sudden and swift development\r\nof an attack at dawn? The Xth Soudanese had now reached the top of the\r\nrise which had hidden Firket, and the whole scene came into view. To the\r\nright front the village of Firket stretched by the side of the river--a\r\nconfusion of mud houses nearly a mile in length and perhaps 300 yards\r\nbroad. On the landward side the tents and straw shelters of the Dervish\r\nforce showed white and yellow. A system of mud walls and loop-holed\r\nhouses strengthened the northern end of the village. Behind it as a\r\nbackground stood lines and clusters of palm-trees, through which the\r\nbroad river and the masts of the Arab boats might be seen. In front\r\nof the troops, but a little to their left, rose a low rocky ridge\r\nsurmounted with flags and defended by a stone breastwork running\r\nalong its base. Across the open space between the village and the hill\r\nhundreds of Dervishes on horse and on foot were hurrying to man their\r\ndefences, and others scrambled up the rocks to see for themselves the\r\nnumbers of the enemy. Scores of little puffs of smoke already speckled\r\nthe black rocks of the ridge and the brown houses of the village.\r\n\r\nThe attack developed very rapidly. The narrow passage between the\r\nmountain and the river poured forth its brigades and battalions, and\r\nthe firing-line stretched away to the right and left with extraordinary\r\nspeed. The Xth Soudanese opened fire on the village as soon as they\r\ntopped the rise. The 3rd and 4th Egyptians deployed on the right and\r\nleft of the leading regiment, two companies of the 4th extending down on\r\nto the foreshore below the steep river-bank. Peake's battery (No. 1) and\r\nthe Maxim guns, coming into action from a spur of Firket mountain, began\r\nto fire over the heads of the advancing infantry.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Lewis's brigade now swung to the right and attacked the\r\nvillage; MacDonald's, coming up at the double in line of battalion\r\ncolumns, deployed to the left, inland, round the shoulder of the\r\nmountain, and, bearing away still more to the left, advanced swiftly\r\nupon the rocky ridge. The ground in MacDonald's front was much broken\r\nby boulders and scrub, and a deep khor delayed the advance. The enemy,\r\nthough taken at obvious disadvantage, maintained an irregular fire;\r\nbut the Soudanese, greatly excited, pressed on eagerly towards the\r\nbreastworks. When the brigade was still 200 yards from the ridge, about\r\nfifty Dervish horsemen dashed out from among the rocks and charged\r\nthe left flank. All were immediately shot down by a wild but heavy\r\nindependent fire. With joyful yells the blacks broke into a run and\r\ncarried the breastworks at the bayonet. The Dervishes did not await\r\nthe shock. As soon as they saw their horsemen--among whom was the Emir\r\nHammuda himself and Yusef Angar, Emir of the Jehadia--swept away, they\r\nabandoned the first ridge and fell back on another which lay behind. The\r\nSoudanese followed closely, and pursued the outnumbered enemy up one\r\nand down the other side of the rocky hills, up again and down again,\r\ncontinually shouldering and bringing round the left of the brigade;\r\nuntil at last the hills were cleared of all except the dead, and the\r\nfugitives were running towards the river-bank. Then the scattered\r\nbattalions re-formed facing west, and the panting soldiers looked about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhile MacDonald's brigade was storming the hills, Lewis's had advanced\r\non the village and the Dervish camp. The Arabs from their loopholed\r\nhouses made a stubborn resistance, and the 4th battalion by the\r\nriver-bank were sharply engaged, their commanding officer, Captain\r\nSparkes, having his horse shot in four places. Encouraged by their\r\nenormous superiority in number and weapons, the Egyptians showed\r\nconsiderable zeal in the attack, and their conduct on this occasion was\r\nregarded as a very happy augury for the war, of which this was the first\r\ngeneral engagement.\r\n\r\nAs Lewis's brigade had swung to its right, and MacDonald's had borne\r\naway to the left, a wide gap had opened in the centre of the attack.\r\nThis was immediately filled by Maxwell's brigade, so that the whole\r\nforce was now formed in one line, which curved and wheeled continually\r\nto the right until, by the time the rocky hills had been taken, all\r\nthree brigades practically faced west and were advancing together\r\ntowards the Nile. The Dervishes--penned between the river and the\r\nenemy, and unable to prevent the remorseless advance, which every moment\r\nrestricted them to narrower limits--now thought only of flight, and they\r\ncould be seen galloping hither and thither seeking for some means of\r\nescape. The position of the Desert Column would have enabled the XIIth\r\nSoudanese, by moving down to the river, to cut off this line of\r\nretreat; but the foreshore of the river at the southern end of Firket is\r\nconcealed from a landward view by the steep bank, and by this sandy path\r\nthe greater number of the fugitives found safety.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry and the Camel Corps, instead of cutting at the flank,\r\ncontented themselves with making a direct pursuit after the enemy had\r\ncrossed their front, and in consequence several hundred Arabs made good\r\ntheir escape to the south. Others swam the river and fled by the west\r\nbank. The wicked Osman Azrak, his authority now no longer disputed, for\r\nhis rival was a corpse, galloped from the field and reached Suarda. The\r\nrest of the Dervish force held to the houses, and variously prepared to\r\nfight to the death or surrender to their conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe three brigades now closed upon the village and, clearing it step by\r\nstep, advanced to the water's edge. MacDonald's brigade did not indeed\r\nstop until they had crossed the swampy isthmus and occupied the island.\r\nThe Arabs, many of whom refused quarter, resisted desperately, though\r\nwithout much effect, and more than eighty corpses were afterwards found\r\nin one group of buildings. By 7.20 o'clock all firing had ceased; the\r\nentire Dervish camp was in the hands of the Egyptian troops, and the\r\nengagement of Firket was over.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar now busied himself with the pursuit, and proceeded with the\r\nmounted troops as far as Mograka, five miles south of Firket. The whole\r\ncavalry force, with the Camel Corps and Horse Artillery, pressed\r\nthe retreat vigorously to Suarda. Osman Azrak, however, succeeded in\r\ntransporting the women and children and some stores, with a sufficient\r\nescort, to the west bank before the arrival of the troops. On the\r\napproach of the cavalry he retired along the east bank, with a small\r\nmounted force, without fighting. The Emir in charge of the escort on the\r\nother side delayed, and was in consequence shelled at long range by the\r\nHorse battery. The local inhabitants, tired of the ceaseless war which\r\nhad desolated the frontier province for so long, welcomed their new\r\nmasters with an appearance of enthusiasm. The main pursuit stopped at\r\nSuarda, but a week later two squadrons and sixteen men of the Camel\r\nCorps, under Captain Mahon, were pushed out twenty miles further south,\r\nand an Arab store of grain was captured.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish loss in the action was severe. More than 800 dead were left\r\non the field, and there were besides 500 wounded and 600 prisoners.\r\nThe casualties in the Egyptian army were 1 British officer--Captain\r\nLegge--wounded, 20 native soldiers killed and 83 wounded.\r\n\r\nFirket is officially classed as a general action: special despatches\r\nwere written, and a special clasp struck. The reader will have formed\r\nhis own estimate of the magnitude and severity of the fight. The whole\r\noperation was well and carefully planned, and its success in execution\r\nwas complete. The long and difficult night march, the accurate arrival\r\nand combination of the two columns, the swift deployment, the enveloping\r\nmovement, proved alike the discipline and training of the troops and the\r\nskill of their officers. The only point on which criticism may be made\r\nis the failure of the Desert Column to intercept the flying Dervishes.\r\nBut it should be remembered they had marched far, and it was not at that\r\ntime certain what the powers of the mounted troops were. The brilliant\r\naspect of the affair caused great satisfaction in England, and the\r\nfurther prosecution of the campaign was looked for with increasing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: THE RECOVERY OF THE DONGOLA PROVINCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCountless and inestimable are the chances of war. Those who read the\r\nstory, and still more those who share the dangers, of a campaign feel\r\nthat every incident is surrounded with a host of possibilities, any one\r\nof which, had it become real, would have changed the whole course of\r\nevents. The influence of Fortune is powerfully and continually exerted.\r\nIn the flickering light of conflict the outlines of solid fact throw\r\non every side the vague shadows of possibility. We live in a world of\r\n'ifs.' 'What happened,' is singular; 'what might have happened,' legion.\r\nBut to try to gauge the influence of this uncertain force were utterly\r\nfutile, and it is perhaps wise, and indisputably convenient, to assume\r\nthat the favourable and adverse chances equate, and then eliminate them\r\nboth from the calculation.\r\n\r\nThe 'Sirdar's luck' became almost proverbial in the Soudan. As the\r\naccount progresses numerous instances will suggest themselves. It was\r\nlucky that the Dervishes did not harass the communications, or assail\r\nAkasha before it was fortified. It was lucky that they fought at Firket;\r\nthat they retired from Berber; that Mahmud did not advance in January;\r\nthat he advanced in March; that he did not retire before the battle of\r\nthe Atbara; that the Khalifa did not hold the Shabluka; that he did not\r\nattack on the night before Omdurman, and that he did attack at dawn.\r\n\r\nBut after Firket all things were contrary. One unexpected misfortune\r\nsucceeded another. Difficulties were replaced by others as soon as\r\nthey had been overcome. The autumn of 1896 was marked by delay and\r\ndisappointment. The state of the Nile, the storms, the floods,\r\nthe cholera, and many minor obstacles, vexed but did not weary the\r\ncommander. The victory at Firket was succeeded by a long pause in the\r\noperations. The army had made one spring forward; it must now gather\r\nenergy for another. The preparations, however, proceeded rapidly. A\r\nstrong camp was formed at Firket. MacDonald's brigade occupied Suarda\r\ntwo days after the fight, and this place now became the advanced\r\npost, just as Akasha had been in the first phase of the campaign. The\r\naccumuluation of stores at Firket and Suarda began forthwith. Owing\r\nto the arrangements which had been made before the engagement it was\r\npossible to collect within one week of the action two months' supplies\r\nat Suarda for the garrison of 2,000 men, and one month's at Firket for\r\nthe 7,000 troops encamped there. Thereafter, however, the necessity of\r\nhurrying the railway construction and the considerable daily demands of\r\n9,000 men only allowed this margin to be increased very gradually.\r\n\r\nThe army had now passed beyond the scope of a camel, or other\r\npack-animal, system of supply, except for very short distances, and\r\nit was obvious that they could only advance in future along either the\r\nrailway or a navigable reach of the river, and preferably along both.\r\nFrom the Dal Cataract near Kosheh there is a clear waterway at high Nile\r\nto Merawi. To Kosheh, therefore, the railway must be extended before\r\nactive operations could recommence. A third condition had also to be\r\nobserved. For the expulsion of the Dervishes from Kerma and Dongola it\r\nwas desirable that a flotilla of gunboats should co-operate with the\r\nland forces. Four of these vessels--the Tamai, El Teb, the Metemma, and\r\nthe Abu Klea; and three steamers--the Kaibar, Dal, and Akasha, which it\r\nwas proposed to arm--had, since 1885, patrolled the river from Assuan to\r\nWady Halfa, and assisted in protecting the frontier from Dervish raids.\r\nAll seven were now collected at the foot of the Second Cataract, and\r\nawaited the rise of the river to attempt the passage. To strengthen\r\nthe flotilla three new and very powerful gunboats had been ordered in\r\nEngland. These were to be brought in sections over the railway to a\r\npoint above the Second Cataract, and be fitted together there. It\r\nwas thus necessary to wait, firstly, for the railway to reach Kosheh;\r\nsecondly, for the Nile to rise; thirdly, for the old gunboats to ascend\r\nthe Cataract; fourthly, for the new gunboats to be launched on the clear\r\nwaterway; and, fifthly, for the accumulation of supplies. With all of\r\nthese matters the Sirdar now busied himself.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the railway to Akasha and its extension beyond\r\nthis place towards Kosheh was pressed forward. By the 26th of June\r\nAkasha was reached. Thenceforward the engineers no longer followed an\r\nexisting track, but were obliged to survey, and to make the formation\r\nfor themselves. Strong fatigue parties from the Egyptian and Soudanese\r\nbattalions were, however, employed on the embankments, and the line\r\ngrew daily longer. On the 24th of July the first train ran across the\r\nbattlefield of Firket; and on the 4th of August the railway was working\r\nto Kosheh.\r\n\r\nKosheh is six miles south of Firket, and consists, like most places\r\nin the 'Military Soudan,' of little more than a name and a few ruined\r\nmud-huts which were once a village. On the 5th of July the whole camp\r\nwas moved thither from the scene of the action. The reasons were clear\r\nand apparent. Kosheh is a point on the river above the Dal Cataract\r\nwhence a clear waterway runs at high Nile to beyond Dongola. The camp at\r\nFirket had become foul and insanitary. The bodies of the dead, swelling\r\nand decaying in their shallow graves, assailed, as if in revenge, the\r\nbodies of the living. The dysentery which had broken out was probably\r\ndue to the 'green' water of the Nile; for during the early period of the\r\nflood what is known as 'the false rise' washes the filth and sewage off\r\nthe foreshore all along the river, and brings down the green and rotting\r\nvegetation from the spongy swamps of Equatoria. The water is then\r\ndangerous and impure. There was nothing else for the army to drink;\r\nbut it was undesirable to aggravate the evil by keeping the troops in a\r\ndirty camp.\r\n\r\nThe earliest freight which the railway carried to Kosheh was the first\r\nof the new stern-wheel gunboats. Train after train arrived with its\r\nload of steel and iron, or with the cumbrous sections of the hull, and\r\na warship in pieces--engines, armaments, fittings and stores--soon lay\r\nstacked by the side of the river. An improvised dockyard, equipped with\r\npowerful twenty-ton shears and other appliances, was established, and\r\nthe work--complicated as a Chinese puzzle--of fitting and riveting\r\ntogether the hundreds of various parts proceeded swiftly. Gradually the\r\nstrange heaps of parts began to evolve a mighty engine of war. The new\r\ngunboats were in every way remarkable. The old vessels had been 90\r\nfeet long. These were 140 feet. Their breadth was 24 feet. They steamed\r\ntwelve miles an hour. They had a command of 30 feet. Their decks were\r\nall protected by steel plates, and prepared by loopholed shields for\r\nmusketry. Their armament was formidable. Each carried one twelve-pounder\r\nquick-firing gun forward, two six-pounder quick-firing guns in the\r\ncentral battery, and four Maxim guns. Every modern improvement--such\r\nas ammunition hoists, telegraphs, search-lights, and steam-winches--was\r\nadded. Yet with all this they drew only thirty-nine inches of water.\r\n\r\nThe contract specified that these vessels should be delivered at\r\nAlexandria by the 5th of September, but, by exertions, the first boat,\r\nthe Zafir, reached Egypt on the 23rd of July, having been made in eight\r\nweeks, and in time to have assisted in the advance on Dongola. The\r\nvessels and machinery had been constructed and erected in the works in\r\nLondon; they were then marked, numbered, and taken to pieces, and after\r\nbeing shipped to Alexandria and transported to the front were finally\r\nput together at Kosheh. Although in a journey of 4,000 miles they were\r\nseven times transhipped, not a single important piece was lost.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of Kosheh on the clear waterway, and the dirty condition\r\nof Firket, were in themselves sufficient reasons for the change of camp;\r\nbut another and graver cause lay behind. During the month of June an\r\nepidemic of cholera began to creep up the Nile from Cairo. On the 29th\r\nthere were some cases at Assuan. On the 30th it reached Wady Halfa. In\r\nconsequence of this the North Staffordshire Regiment marched into camp\r\nat Gemai. Their three months' occupation of the town had not improved\r\ntheir health or their spirits. During the sixteen-mile march along the\r\nrailway track to Gemai the first fatal case occurred, and thereafter\r\nthe sickness clung to the regiment until the middle of August, causing\r\ncontinual deaths.\r\n\r\nThe cholera spread steadily southward up the river, claiming successive\r\nvictims in each camp. In the second week of July it reached the new\r\ncamp at Kosheh, whence all possible precautions to exclude it had proved\r\nvain. The epidemic was at first of a virulent form. As is usual, when\r\nit had expended its destructive energy, the recoveries became more\r\nfrequent. But of the first thousand cases between Assuan and Suarda\r\nnearly eight hundred proved fatal. Nor were the lives thus lost to be\r\naltogether measured by the number. [The attacks and deaths from cholera\r\nin the Dongola Expeditionary Force were as follow: British troops--24\r\nattacks, 19 deaths; Native troops--406 attacks, 260 deaths;\r\nFollowers--788 attacks, 640 deaths.] To all, the time was one of trial,\r\nalmost of terror. The violence of the battle may be cheaply braved,\r\nbut the insidious attacks of disease appal the boldest. Death moved\r\ncontinually about the ranks of the army--not the death they had been\r\ntrained to meet unflinchingly, the death in high enthusiasm and the\r\npride of life, with all the world to weep or cheer; but a silent,\r\nunnoticed, almost ignominious summons, scarcely less sudden and far more\r\npainful than the bullet or the sword-cut. The Egyptians, in spite of\r\ntheir fatalistic creed, manifested profound depression. The English\r\nsoldiers were moody and ill-tempered. Even the light-hearted Soudanese\r\nlost their spirits; their merry grins were seen no longer; their\r\nlaughter and their drums were stilled. Only the British officers\r\npreserved a stony cheerfulness, and ceaselessly endeavoured by energy\r\nand example to sustain the courage of their men. Yet they suffered\r\nmost of all. Their education had developed their imaginations; and\r\nimagination, elsewhere a priceless gift, is amid such circumstances a\r\ndangerous burden.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a time of sore trouble. To find the servant dead in the\r\ncamp kitchen; to catch a hurried glimpse of blanketed shapes hustled\r\nquickly to the desert on a stretcher; to hold the lantern over the grave\r\ninto which a friend or comrade--alive and well six hours before--was\r\nhastily lowered, even though it was still night; and through it all to\r\nwork incessantly at pressure in the solid, roaring heat, with a mind\r\never on the watch for the earliest of the fatal symptoms and a thirst\r\nthat could only be quenched by drinking of the deadly and contaminated\r\nNile: all these things combined to produce an experience which those who\r\nendured are unwilling to remember, but unlikely to forget. One by one\r\nsome of the best of the field army and the communication Staff were\r\nstricken down. Gallant Fenwick, of whom they used to say that he was\r\n'twice a V.C. without a gazette'; Polwhele, the railway subaltern, whose\r\nstrange knowledge of the Egyptian soldiers had won their stranger love;\r\nTrask, an heroic doctor, indifferent alike to pestilence or bullets; Mr.\r\nVallom, the chief superintendent of engines at Halfa; Farmer, a young\r\nofficer already on his fourth campaign; Mr. Nicholson, the London\r\nengineer; long, quaint, kind-hearted 'Roddy' Owen--all filled graves in\r\nHalfa cemetery or at the foot of Firket mountain. At length the epidemic\r\nwas stamped out, and by the middle of August it had practically ceased\r\nto be a serious danger. But the necessity of enforcing quarantine\r\nand other precautions had hampered movement up and down the line of\r\ncommunications, and so delayed the progress of the preparations for an\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nOther unexpected hindrances arose. Sir H. Kitchener had clearly\r\nrecognised that the railway, equipped as it then was, would be at the\r\nbest a doubtful means for the continual supply of a large force many\r\nmiles ahead of it. He therefore organised an auxiliary boat service and\r\npassed gyassas and nuggurs [native sailing craft] freely up the Second\r\nCataract. During the summer months, in the Soudan, a strong north\r\nwind prevails, which not only drives the sailing-boats up against the\r\nstream--sometimes at the rate of twenty miles a day--but also gratefully\r\ncools the air. This year, for forty consecutive days, at the critical\r\nperiod of the campaign, the wind blew hot and adverse from the south.\r\nThe whole auxiliary boat service was thus practically arrested. But in\r\nspite of these aggravating obstacles the preparations for the advance\r\nwere forced onwards, and it soon became necessary for the gunboats and\r\nsteamers to be brought on to the upper reach of the river.\r\n\r\nThe Second Cataract has a total descent of sixty feet, and is about\r\nnine miles long. For this distance the Nile flows down a rugged stairway\r\nformed by successive ledges of black granite. The flood river deeply\r\nsubmerges these steps, and rushes along above them with tremendous\r\nforce, but with a smooth though swirling surface. As the Nile subsides,\r\nthe steps begin to show, until the river tumbles violently from ledge to\r\nledge, its whole surface for miles churned to the white foam of broken\r\nwater, and thickly studded with black rocks. At the Second Cataract,\r\nmoreover, the only deep channel of the Nile is choked between narrow\r\nlimits, and the stream struggles furiously between stern walls of\r\nrock. These dark gorges present many perils to the navigator. The most\r\nformidable, the Bab-el-Kebir, is only thirty-five feet wide. The river\r\nhere takes a plunge of ten feet in seventy yards, and drops five feet at\r\na single bound. An extensive pool above, formed by the junction of two\r\narms of the river, increases the volume of the water and the force of\r\nthe stream, so that the 'Gate' constitutes an obstacle of difficulty and\r\ndanger which might well have been considered insurmountable.\r\n\r\nIt had been expected that in the beginning of July enough water would\r\nbe passing down the Second Cataract to enable the gunboats and steamers\r\nwaiting below to make the passage. Everything depended upon the rise of\r\nthe river, and in the perversity of circumstances the river this year\r\nrose much later and slower than usual. By the middle of August, however,\r\nthe attempt appeared possible. On the 14th the first gunboat, the\r\nMetemma, approached the Cataract. The North Staffordshire Regiment from\r\nGemai, and the 6th and 7th Egyptian Battalions from Kosheh, marched to\r\nthe 'Gate' to draw the vessel bodily up in spite of the current. The\r\nbest native pilots had been procured. Colonel Hunter and the naval\r\nofficers under Commander Colville directed the work. The boat had been\r\ncarefully prepared for the ordeal. To reduce, by raising the free-board,\r\nthe risk of swamping, the bows were heightened and strengthened, and\r\nstout wooden bulwarks were built running from bow to stern. Guns and\r\nammunition were then removed, and the vessel lightened by every possible\r\nmeans. A strop of wire rope was passed completely round the hull, and to\r\nthis strong belt the five cables were fastened--two on each side and\r\none at the bow. So steep was the slope of the water that it was found\r\nnecessary to draw all the fires, and the steamer was thus dependent\r\nentirely upon external force. It was luckily possible to obtain a\r\ndirect pull, for a crag of black rock rose above the surface of the pool\r\nopposite the 'Gate.' On this a steel block was fixed, and the hawser was\r\nled away at right angles until it reached the east bank, where a smooth\r\nstretch of sand afforded a convenient place for the hauling parties.\r\nTwo thousand men were then set to pull at the cables, yet such was the\r\nextraordinary force of the current that, although the actual distance in\r\nwhich these great efforts were necessary was scarcely one hundred yards,\r\nthe passage of each steamer occupied an hour and a half, and required\r\nthe most strenuous exertions of the soldiers. No accident, however,\r\noccurred, and the six other vessels accomplished the ascent on\r\nsuccessive days. In a week the whole flotilla steamed safely in the open\r\nwater of the upper reach.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a moment it seemed that the luck of the expedition had\r\nreturned. The cholera was practically extinct. The new gunboat Zafir\r\nwas nearly ready at Kosheh, and her imposing appearance delighted and\r\nimpressed the army. On the 23rd of August all the seven steamers which\r\nhad passed the Cataract arrived in a stately procession opposite the\r\ncamp. Almost at the same time the wind changed to the north, and a\r\ncool and delicious breeze refreshed the weary men and bore southward\r\nto Suarda a whole fleet of sailing boats laden with supplies, which had\r\nbeen lying weather-bound during the previous six weeks at the head of\r\nthe rapids. The preparatory orders for the advance tinkled along the\r\ntelegraph. The North Staffordshire Regiment were, to the intense relief\r\nof officers and men, warned to hold themselves in readiness for an\r\nimmediate move. The mounted troops had already returned to the front\r\nfrom the camps in which they had been distributed. At last the miserable\r\ndelay was over.\r\n\r\nFrom Kosheh to Kerma, the first Dervish position, the distance by river\r\nis 127 miles. A study of the map shows that by land marches this can be\r\nshortened by nearly forty-one miles; thirty miles being saved by cutting\r\nacross the great loop of the Nile from Kosheh to Sadin Fanti, and eleven\r\nmiles by avoiding the angle from Fereig to Abu Fatmeh. From Kerma\r\nto Dongola, which latter town was the objective of the expedition, a\r\nfurther distance of thirty-five miles must be traversed, making a total\r\nof 120 miles by land or 161 by river. The long desert march from Kosheh\r\nto Sadin Fanti was the only natural difficulty by land. Although the\r\nriver from Kosheh to Kerma is broken by continual rapids, it is, with\r\none interval, freely navigable at half Nile. The Amara Cataract, ten\r\nmiles beyond Kosheh, is easily ascended by sailing boats with a fair\r\nwind, and by steamers without assistance. From Amara to the Kaibar\r\nCataract stretches a reach of sixty-five miles of open water. The Kaibar\r\nCataract is, during the flood, scarcely any hindrance to navigation; but\r\nat Hannek, about thirty miles further on, the three miles of islands,\r\nrocks, rapids, and broken water which are called the Third Cataract are,\r\nexcept at high Nile, a formidable barrier, Once this is passed, there is\r\nopen water for more than 200 miles at all seasons to Merawi. The banks\r\nof the river, except near Sadin Fanti, where the hills close in, are\r\nflat and low. The Eastern bank is lined with a fringe of palm-trees\r\nand a thin strip of cultivation, which constitutes what is called 'the\r\nfertile province of Dongola.' On the other side the desert reaches the\r\nwater's edge. Along the right bank of this part of the river the army\r\nwas now to move.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the advance was the occupation of Absarat, and on the\r\n23rd of August MacDonald's brigade marched thither from Suarda, cutting\r\nacross the desert to Sadin Fanti, and then following the bank of the\r\nNile. The occupation of Absarat covered the next movement. On the 26th\r\nLewis's brigade was ordered to march across the loop from Kosheh to\r\nSadin Fanti, and reinforce the brigade at Absarat. The distance of\r\nthirty-seven miles was far too great to be accomplished without a system\r\nof watering-places. This the Sirdar rapidly organised. Water-depots were\r\nformed by carrying tanks and water-skins on camels to two points in the\r\ndesert, and replenishing them by daily convoys. But now a heavy calamity\r\ndescended on the arrangements of the General and the hopes of the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of the 25th the wind veered suddenly to the south,\r\nand thereupon a terrific storm of sand and rain, accompanied by thunder\r\nand lightning, burst over the whole of the Nubian desert, and swept\r\nalong the line of communications from Suarda to Halfa. On the next day a\r\nsecond deluge delayed the march of Lewis's brigade. But late on the 27th\r\nthey started, with disastrous results. Before they had reached the\r\nfirst watering-place a third tempest, preceded by its choking sandstorm,\r\novertook them. Nearly 300 men fell out during the early part of the\r\nnight, and crawled and staggered back to Kosheh. Before the column\r\nreached Sadin Fanti 1,700 more sank exhausted to the ground. Out of one\r\nbattalion 700 strong, only sixty men marched in. Nine deaths and eighty\r\nserious cases of prostration occurred, and the movement of the brigade\r\nfrom Kosheh to Absarat was grimly called 'The Death March.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Death March' was the least of the misfortunes caused by the storms.\r\nThe violent rains produced floods such as had not been seen in the\r\nSoudan for fifty years. The water, pouring down the broad valleys,\r\nformed furious torrents in the narrower gorges. More than twelve miles\r\nof the railway was washed away. The rails were twisted and bent; the\r\nformation entirely destroyed. The telegraph wires were broken. The work\r\nof weeks was lost in a few hours. The advance was stopped as soon as it\r\nhad been begun. At the moment when every military reason demanded speed\r\nand suddenness, a hideous delay became inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn this time of crisis the success of the whole campaign hung in the\r\nbalance. Sir Herbert Kitchener did not then possess that measure of the\r\nconfidence and affection of his officers which his military successes\r\nhave since compelled. Public opinion was still undecided on the general\r\nquestion of the war. The initial bad luck had frightened many. All\r\nthe croakers were ready. 'A Jingo Government'--'An incapable\r\ngeneral'--'Another disaster in the Soudan'--such were the whispers.\r\nA check would be the signal for an outcry. The accounts of 'The Death\r\nMarch' had not yet reached England; but the correspondents, irritated\r\nat being 'chained to headquarters,' were going to see about that. And,\r\nbesides all this, there were the army to feed and the Dervishes to\r\nfight. In this serious emergency, which threatened to wreck his schemes,\r\nthe Sirdar's organising talents shone more brilliantly than at any other\r\nmoment in this account. Travelling swiftly to Moghrat, he possessed\r\nhimself of the telephone, which luckily still worked. He knew the exact\r\nposition or every soldier, coolie, camel, or donkey at his disposal. In\r\na few hours, in spite of his crippled transport, he concentrated 5,000\r\nmen on the damaged sections of the line, and thereafter fed them until\r\nthe work was finished. In seven days traffic was resumed. The advance\r\nhad been delayed, but it was not prevented.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September the 1st (Lewis) and 2nd (MacDonald) Brigades\r\nmoved to Dulgo, and at the same time the remainder of the army began\r\nto march across the loop from Kosheh by Sadin Fanti to Absarat. Every\r\navailable soldier had been collected for the final operation of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe Expeditionary Force was organised as follows:\r\n\r\n Commander-in-Chief: The SIRDAR\r\n\r\n The Infantry Division: COLONEL HUNTER Commanding\r\n\r\n  1st Brigade      2nd Brigade       3rd Brigade       4th Brigade\r\n  MAJOR LEWIS      MAJOR MACDONALD   MAJOR MAXWELL     MAJOR DAVID\r\n  3rd Egyptians    XIth Soudanese    2nd Egyptians     1st Egyptians\r\n  4th     \"        XIIth    \"        7th     \"         5th     \"\r\n  IXth Soudanese   XIIIth   \"        8th     \"         15th    \"\r\n  Xth      \"\r\n\r\n Cavalry Brigade and Mounted Forces: MAJOR BURN-MURDOCH\r\n\r\n  Cavalry.....   8 squadrons\r\n  Camel Corps....   6 companies\r\n  Horse Artillery...   1 battery\r\n\r\n Artillery: MAJOR PARSONS\r\n\r\n  Field Artillery...   2 batteries\r\n  Maxims    . ...   1 battery (British)\r\n\r\n Divisional Troops: MAJOR CURRIE\r\n\r\n  North Staffordshire Regiment....   1st Battalion\r\n\r\n The Flotilla: COMMANDER COLVILLE\r\n\r\n  Gunboats...   Zafir, Tamai, Abu Klea, Metemma, El Teb\r\n  Armed Steamers...   Kaibar, Dal, Akasha\r\n\r\n    Total: 15,000 men, 8 war-vessels, and 36 guns\r\n\r\n\r\nThus thirteen of the sixteen battalions of the Egyptian Army were\r\nemployed at the front. Two others, the 6th and XIVth, were disposed\r\nalong the line of communication, holding the various fortified posts.\r\nThe 16th Battalion of reservists remained at Suakin. The whole native\r\narmy was engaged in the war, and the preservation of domestic order in\r\nthe capital and throughout the Khedive's dominions was left entirely to\r\nthe police and to the British Army of Occupation. By the 9th all four\r\nbrigades had reached the rendezvous at Dulgo; on the 10th the British\r\nregiment, which it was determined to send up in the steamers, was moved\r\nto Kosheh by rail from Sarras and Gemai. The Sirdar prepared to start\r\nwith the flotilla on the 12th.\r\n\r\nBut a culminating disappointment remained. By tremendous exertions\r\nthe Zafir had been finished in time to take part in the operations.\r\nThroughout the army it was expected that the Zafir would be the feature\r\nof the campaign. At length the work was finished, and the Zafir floated,\r\npowerful and majestic, on the waters of the Nile. On the afternoon of\r\nthe 11th of September many officers and men came to witness her trial\r\ntrip. The bank was lined with spectators. Colville took command. The\r\nSirdar and his Staff embarked. Flags were hoisted and amid general\r\ncheering the moorings were cast off. But the stern paddle had hardly\r\nrevolved twice when there was a loud report, like that of a heavy gun,\r\nclouds of steam rushed up from the boilers, and the engines stopped. Sir\r\nH. Kitchener and Commander Colville were on the upper deck. The latter\r\nrushed below to learn what had happened, and found that she had burst\r\nher low-pressure cylinder, a misfortune impossible to repair until a new\r\none could be obtained from Halfa and fitted.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, however, the advance was not delayed. On the 13th the\r\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades occupied Kaderma. Here the flotilla overtook\r\nthem, and henceforward the boats on the river kept pace with the army on\r\nthe bank. Fareig was reached on the 14th, and as the numerous palms by\r\nthe water afforded a pleasant shade a halt of two days was ordered. On\r\nthe 16th the 4th Brigade arrived, and the concentration of the force was\r\nthen complete.\r\n\r\nAfter the annihilation of his strong advanced post at Firket, the\r\nDervish Emir, Wad Bishara, concentrated his remaining forces in Dongola.\r\nHere during the summer he had awaited, and in the middle of August\r\nsome small reinforcements under one Emir of low rank reached him from\r\nOmdurman. The Khalifa, indeed, promised that many more should follow,\r\nbut his promises long remained unfulfilled, and the greatest strength\r\nthat Bishara could muster was 900 Jehadia, 800 Baggara Arabs, 2,800\r\nspearmen, 450 camelmen, 650 cavalry--in all 5,600 men, with six small\r\nbrass cannon and one mitrailleuse gun. To augment in numbers, if not\r\nin strength, this small force of regular soldiers, he impressed a large\r\nnumber of the local tribesmen; but as these were, for the most part,\r\nanxious to join the Government troops at the first opportunity, their\r\neffect in the conflict was inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe first sign that the forces were drawing closer was the cutting of\r\nthe telegraph-wire by a Dervish patrol on the 6th of September. On\r\nthe 10th the Sirdar heard that Kerma was strongly held. On the 15th\r\nof September the Egyptian cavalry first established contact with the\r\nDervish scouts, and a slight skirmish took place. On the 18th the whole\r\nforce advanced to Sardek, and as Bishara still held his position at\r\nKerma it looked as if an action was imminent. It was resolved to attack\r\nthe Dervish position at Kerma at dawn. Although it seemed that only four\r\nmiles separated the combatants, the night passed quietly. With the first\r\nlight the army began to move, and when the sun rose the spectacle of the\r\nmoving masses of men and artillery, with the gunboats on the right, was\r\ninspiring. The soldiers braced themselves for the expected action. But\r\nno sooner were the village and fort of Kerma visible than the report\r\npassed along the ranks that they were deserted. Rumour was soon merged\r\nin certainty, for on reaching Kerma it was found that the Dervishes had\r\nevacuated the place, and only the strong, well-built mud fort attested\r\nthe recent presence of Bishara. Whither had he gone? The question was\r\nnot left unanswered.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile to the southward, on the opposite bank of the river, among\r\nthe groves of palm-trees ran a long and continuous line of shelter\r\ntrenches and loopholed walls. The flanks of this new position rested\r\non the deep morasses which extend from the river both on the north and\r\nsouth sides of Hafir. A small steamer, a fleet of large gyassas and\r\nother sailing vessels moored to the further shore explained what had\r\nhappened. Conscious of his weakness, the prudent Emir had adroitly\r\ntransported himself across the river, and had thus placed that broad\r\nflood between his troops and their destruction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the three gunboats--all that now remained of the armed\r\nflotilla, for the Teb had run on a rock in the Hannek Cataract--were\r\nsteaming gradually nearer the enemy, and the army swung to the right,\r\nand, forming along the river bank, became spectators of a scene of\r\nfascinating interest. At half-past six the Horse battery unlimbered at\r\nthe water's edge, and began to fire obliquely up and across the river.\r\nAs soon as the first few shells had reached the Arab entrenchment the\r\nwhole line of shelter trenches was edged with smoke, and the Dervishes\r\nreplied with a heavy rifle fire. The distance was, however, too great\r\nfor their bad rifles and inferior ammunition, and their bullets,\r\nalthough they occasionally struck the ground on which the infantry were\r\ndrawn up, did not during the day cause any loss to the watching army.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish position was about half a mile in length. As the gunboats\r\napproached the northern end they opened fire with their guns, striking\r\nthe mud entrenchments at every shot, and driving clouds of dust and\r\nsplinters into the air. The Maxim guns began to search the parapets,\r\nand two companies of the Staffordshire Regiment on board the unarmoured\r\nsteamers Dal and Akasha fired long-range volleys. Now, as on other\r\noccasions throughout the war, the Dervishes by their military behaviour\r\nexcited the admiration of their enemies. Encouraged by the arrival in\r\nthe morning of a reinforcement from Omdurman of 1,000 Black Jehadia and\r\n500 spearmen under Abdel Baki, the Dervish gunners stood to their guns\r\nand the riflemen to their trenches, and, although suffering severely,\r\nmaintained a formidable fire.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats continued to advance, beating up slowly against the strong\r\ncurrent. As they came opposite Hafir, where the channel narrows to about\r\n600 yards, they were received by a very heavy fire from guns placed in\r\ncleverly screened batteries, and from the riflemen sheltered in deep\r\npits by the water's edge or concealed amid the foliage of the tops of\r\nthe palm-trees. These aerial skirmishers commanded the decks of the\r\nvessels, and the shields of the guns were thus rendered of little\r\nprotection. All the water round the gunboats was torn into foam by the\r\nprojectiles. The bullets pattered against their sides, and, except where\r\nthey were protected by steel plates, penetrated. One shell struck the\r\nAbu Klea on the water-line, and entered the magazine. Luckily it did not\r\nexplode, the Dervishes having forgotten to set the fuse. Three shells\r\nstruck the Metemma. On board the Tamai, which was leading, Commander\r\nColville was severely wounded in the wrist; Armourer-Sergeant Richardson\r\nwas killed at his Maxim gun, and on each boat some casualties occurred.\r\nSo hot was the fire that it was thought doubtful whether to proceed with\r\nthe bombardment, and the Tamai swung round, and hurried down the river\r\nwith the current and at full steam to report to the Sirdar. The\r\nother gunboats remained in action, and continued to shell the Dervish\r\ndefences. The Tamai soon returned to the fight, and, steaming again up\r\nthe river, was immediately hotly re-engaged.\r\n\r\nThe sight which the army witnessed was thrilling. Beyond the flood\r\nwaters of the river, backed against a sky of staring blue and in the\r\nblazing sunlight, the whole of the enemy's position was plainly visible.\r\nThe long row of shelter trenches was outlined by the white smoke of\r\nmusketry and dotted with the bright-coloured flags waving defiantly in\r\nthe wind and with the still brighter flashes of the guns. Behind the\r\nentrenchments and among the mud houses and enclosures strong bodies of\r\nthe jibba-clad Arabs were arrayed. Still further back in the plain a\r\nlarge force of cavalry--conspicuous by the gleams of light reflected\r\nfrom their broad-bladed spears--wheeled and manœuvred. By the Nile\r\nall the tops of the palm-trees were crowded with daring riflemen, whose\r\npositions were indicated by the smoke-puffs of their rifles, or when\r\nsome tiny black figure fell, like a shot rook, to the ground. In\r\nthe foreground the gunboats, panting and puffing up the river, were\r\nsurrounded on all sides by spouts and spurts of water, thrown up by the\r\nshells and bullets. Again the flotilla drew near the narrow channel;\r\nagain the watching army held their breath; and again they saw the\r\nleading boat, the Metemma, turn and run down stream towards safety,\r\npursued by the wild cheers of the Arabs. It was evident that the\r\ngunboats were not strong enough to silence the Dervish fire. The want of\r\nthe terrible Zafir was acutely felt.\r\n\r\nThe firing had lasted two hours and a half, and the enemy's resistance\r\nwas no less vigorous than at the beginning of the action. The Sirdar now\r\naltered his plans. He saw that his flotilla could not hope to silence\r\nthe Dervishes. He therefore ordered De Rougemont--who had assumed\r\nthe command after Colville was wounded--to run past the entrenchments\r\nwithout trying to crush their fire, and steam on to Dongola. To support\r\nand cover the movement, the three batteries of artillery under Major\r\nParsons were brought into action from the swampy island of Artagasha,\r\nwhich was connected at this season with the right bank by a shoal. At\r\nthe same time three battalions of infantry were moved along the river\r\nuntil opposite the Arab position. At 9 A.M. the eighteen guns on the\r\nisland opened a tremendous bombardment at 1,200 yards range on the\r\nentrenchments, and at the same time the infantry and a rocket detachment\r\nconcentrated their fire on the tops of the palm-trees. The artillery now\r\nsucceeded in silencing three of the five Dervish guns and in sinking\r\nthe little Dervish steamer Tahra, while the infantry by a tremendous\r\nlong-range fire drove the riflemen out of the palms. Profiting by\r\nthis, the gunboats at ten o'clock moved up the river in line, and,\r\ndisregarding the fusillade which the Arabs still stubbornly maintained,\r\npassed by the entrenchment and steamed on towards Dongola. After this\r\nthe firing on both sides became intermittent, and the fight may be said\r\nto have ended.\r\n\r\nBoth forces remained during the day facing each other on opposite sides\r\nof the river, and the Dervishes, who evidently did not admit a defeat,\r\nbrandished their rifles and waved their flags, and their shouts of loud\r\ndefiance floated across the water to the troops. But they had suffered\r\nvery heavily. Their brave and skilful leader was severely wounded by\r\nthe splinters of a shell. The wicked Osman Azrak had been struck by a\r\nbullet, and more than 200 Ansar had fallen, including several Emirs.\r\nMoreover, a long train of wounded was seen to start during the afternoon\r\nfor the south. It is doubtful, however, whether Bishara would have\r\nretreated, if he had not feared being cut off. He seems to have believed\r\nthat the Sirdar would march along the right bank at once to Dongola, and\r\ncross there under cover of his gunboats. Like all Moslem soldiers, he\r\nwas nervous about his line of retreat. Nor, considering the overwhelming\r\nforce against him, can we wonder. There was, besides this strategic\r\nreason for retiring, a more concrete cause. All his supplies of grain\r\nwere accumulated in the gyassas which lay moored to the west bank. These\r\nvessels were under the close and accurate fire of the artillery and\r\nMaxim guns on Artagasha island. Several times during the night the\r\nhungry Dervishes attempted to reach their store; but the moon was bright\r\nand the gunners watchful. Each time the enemy exposed themselves, a\r\nvigorous fire was opened and they were driven back. When morning dawned,\r\nit was found that Hafir was evacuated, and that the enemy had retreated\r\non Dongola.\r\n\r\nWad Bishara's anxiety about his line of retreat was unnecessary, for the\r\nSirdar could not advance on Dongola with a strong Dervish force on his\r\nline of communications: and it was not desirable to divide the army and\r\nmask Hafir with a covering force. But as soon as the Dervishes had left\r\ntheir entrenchments the situation was simplified. At daybreak all the\r\nArab boats were brought over to the right bank by the villagers, who\r\nreported that Bishara and his soldiers had abandoned the defence and\r\nwere retreating to Dongola. Thereupon the Sirdar, relieved of the\r\nnecessity of forcing the passage, transported his army peacefully to the\r\nother bank. The operation afforded scope to his powers of organisation,\r\nand the whole force--complete with cavalry, camels, and guns--was\r\nmoved across the broad, rushing river in less than thirty-six hours and\r\nwithout any apparent difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe casualties on the 19th were not numerous, and in a force of nearly\r\n15,000 men they appear insignificant. Commander Colville was wounded.\r\nOne British sergeant and one Egyptian officer were killed. Eleven native\r\nsoldiers were wounded. The total--fourteen--amounted to less than one\r\nper thousand of the troops engaged. Nevertheless this picturesque and\r\nbloodless affair has been solemnly called the 'Battle of Hafir.' Special\r\ndespatches were written for it. It is officially counted in records of\r\nservice as a 'general action.' Telegrams of congratulation were received\r\nfrom her Majesty and the Khedive. A special clasp was struck. Of all the\r\ninstances of cheaply bought glory which the military history of recent\r\nyears affords, Hafir is the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe 20th and part of the 21st were occupied by the passage of the\r\narmy across the Nile. The troops were still crossing when the gunboats\r\nreturned from Dongola. The distance of this place by water from Hafir is\r\nabout thirty-six miles, and the flotilla had arrived opposite the\r\ntown during the afternoon of the 19th. A few shells expelled the small\r\nDervish garrison, and a large number of sailing vessels were captured.\r\nThe results of the movement of the gunboats to Dongola must, however, be\r\nlooked for at Hafir. In consequence of the Sirdar's manœuvre that place\r\nwas evacuated and the unopposed passage of the river secured.\r\n\r\nBishara continued his retreat during the 20th, and, marching all day,\r\nreached Dongola in the evening. Wounded as he was, he re-occupied the\r\ntown and began forthwith to make preparations for the defence of its\r\nconsiderable fortifications. The knowledge of his employment was not\r\nhidden from his enemy, and during the 21st the gunboat Abu Klea,\r\nunder Lieutenant Beatty, R.N., arrived with the design of keeping him\r\noccupied. Throughout the day a desultory duel was maintained between\r\nthe entrenchments and the steamer. At daylight on the 22nd, Beatty was\r\nreinforced by another gunboat, and an unceasing bombardment was made on\r\nthe town and its defences.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the army did not finish crossing the river until\r\nthe afternoon of the 21st, the Sirdar determined to continue his advance\r\nwithout delay, and the force accordingly marched twelve miles further\r\nsouth and camped opposite the middle of the large island of Argo. At\r\ndaybreak the troops started again, and before the sun had attained its\r\ngreatest power reached Zowarat. This place was scarcely six miles from\r\nDongola, and, as it was expected that an action would be fought the next\r\nday, the rest of eighteen hours was welcomed by the weary soldiers. All\r\nday long the army remained halted by the palms of the Nile bank.\r\nLooking through their glasses up the river, the officers might watch the\r\ngunboats methodically bombarding Dongola, and the sound of the guns was\r\nclearly heard. At intervals during the day odd parties of Dervishes,\r\nboth horse and foot, approached the outpost line and shots were\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nAll these things, together with the consciousness that the culmination\r\nof the campaign was now at hand, raised the excitement of the army to\r\na high pitch, and everyone lay down that night warmed by keen\r\nanticipations. An atmosphere of unrest hung over the bivouac, and\r\nfew slept soundly. At three o'clock the troops were aroused, and at\r\nhalf-past four the final advance on Dongola had begun.\r\n\r\nIt was still night. The full moon, shining with tropical brilliancy in a\r\ncloudless sky, vaguely revealed the rolling plains of sand and the huge\r\nmoving mass of the army. As long as it was dark the battalions were\r\nclosely formed in quarter columns. But presently the warmer, yellower\r\nlight of dawn began to grow across the river and through the palms, and\r\ngradually, as the sun rose and it became daylight, the dense formation\r\nof the army was extended to an array more than two miles long. On the\r\nleft, nearest the river, marched Lewis's brigade--three battalions in\r\nline and the fourth in column as a reserve. Next in order Maxwell's\r\nthree battalions prolonged the line. The artillery were in the centre,\r\nsupported by the North Staffordshire Regiment. The gunners of the Maxim\r\nbattery had donned their tunics, so that the lines and columns of yellow\r\nand brown were relieved by a vivid flash of British red. MacDonald's\r\nbrigade was on the right. David's brigade followed in rear of the centre\r\nas a reserve. The cavalry, the Camel Corps, and the Horse Artillery\r\nwatched the right flank; and on the left the gunboats steamed along the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nFor two hours the army were the only living things visible on the smooth\r\nsand, but at seven o'clock a large body of Dervish horse appeared on\r\nthe right flank. The further advance of half a mile discovered the Arab\r\nforces. Their numbers were less than those of the Egyptians, but their\r\nwhite uniforms, conspicuous on the sand, and the rows of flags of many\r\ncolours lent an imposing appearance to their array. Their determined\r\naspect, no less than the reputation of Bishara, encouraged the belief\r\nthat they were about to charge.\r\n\r\nThe disparity of the forces was, however, too great; and as the Egyptian\r\narmy steadily advanced, the Dervishes slowly retired. Their retreat was\r\ncleverly covered by the Baggara horse, who, by continually threatening\r\nthe desert flank, delayed the progress of the troops. Bishara did\r\nnot attempt to re-enter the town, on which the gunboats were now\r\nconcentrating their fire, but continued to retire in excellent order\r\ntowards the south and Debba.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian infantry halted in Dongola, which when they arrived they\r\nfound already in the hands of detachments from the flotilla. The red\r\nflag with the Crescent and star waved once again from the roof of the\r\nMudiria. The garrison of 400 black Jehadia had capitulated, and were\r\nalready fraternising with their Soudanese captors, whose comrades in\r\narms they were soon to be. While the infantry occupied the town the\r\ncavalry and Camel Corps were despatched in pursuit. The Baggara horse,\r\nhowever, maintained a firm attitude, and attempted several charges to\r\ncover the retreat of their infantry. In one of these an actual collision\r\noccurred, and Captain Adams's squadron of Egyptian cavalry inflicted\r\na loss of six killed on the enemy at a cost to themselves of eight men\r\nwounded. The cavalry and Camel corps had about twenty casualties in the\r\npursuit. But although the Dervishes thus withdrew in an orderly manner\r\nfrom the field, the demoralising influence of retreat soon impaired\r\ntheir discipline and order, and many small parties, becoming detached\r\nfrom the main body, were captured by the pursuers. The line of retreat\r\nwas strewn with weapons and other effects, and so many babies were\r\nabandoned by their parents that an artillery waggon had to be employed\r\nto collect and carry them. Wad Bishara, Osman Azrak, and the Baggara\r\nhorse, however, made good their flight across the desert to Metemma,\r\nand, in spite of terrible sufferings from thirst, retained sufficient\r\ndiscipline to detach a force to hold Abu Klea Wells in case the retreat\r\nwas followed. The Dervish infantry made their way along the river to\r\nAbu Hamed, and were much harassed by the gunboats until they reached the\r\nFourth Cataract, when the pursuit was brought to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian losses in the capture of Dongola and in the subsequent\r\npursuit were: British, nil. Native ranks: killed, 1; wounded, 25. Total,\r\n26.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Dongola terminated the campaign of 1896. About 900\r\nprisoners, mostly the Black Jehadia, all the six brass cannon, large\r\nstores of grain, and a great quantity of flags, spears, and swords\r\nfell to the victors, and the whole of the province, said to be the\r\nmost fertile in the Soudan, was restored to the Egyptian authority.\r\nThe existence of a perpetual clear waterway from the head of the Third\r\nCataract to Merawi enabled the gunboats at once to steam up the river\r\nfor more than 200 miles, and in the course of the following month the\r\ngreater part of the army was established in Merawi below the Fourth\r\nCataract, at Debba, or at Korti, drawing supplies along the railway,\r\nand from Railhead by a boat service on the long reach of open water.\r\nThe position of a strong force at Merawi--only 120 miles along the river\r\nbank from Abu Hamed, the northern Dervish post--was, as will be seen,\r\nconvenient to the continuance of the campaign whenever the time should\r\narrive. But a long delay in the advance was now inevitable, and nearly\r\na year was destined to pass without any collision between the forces of\r\nthe Khedive and those of the Khalifa.\r\n\r\nThe success of the operations caused great public satisfaction in\r\nEngland. The first step had been taken. The Soudan was re-entered. After\r\nten years of defensive war the Dervishes had been attacked, and it was\r\nclear that when they were attacked with adequate forces they were not so\r\nvery terrible after all. The croakers were silent. A general desire\r\nwas manifested in the country that the operations should continue, and\r\nalthough the Government did not yet abandon their tentative policy, or\r\nresolve utterly to destroy the Khalifa's power, it was decided that, as\r\nthe road had so far been safe and pleasant, there was at present no need\r\nto stop or turn back.\r\n\r\nA generous gazette of honours was published. With a single exception,\r\nwhich it would be invidious to specify, all the officers of the Egyptian\r\narmy were mentioned in despatches. Sir H. Kitchener, Colonel Hunter, and\r\nColonel Rundle were promoted Major-Generals for distinguished service\r\nin the field; a special medal--on whose ribbon the Blue Nile is shown\r\nflowing through the yellow desert--was struck; and both the engagement\r\nat Firket and the affair at Hafir were commemorated by clasps. The\r\ncasualties during the campaign, including the fighting round Suakin,\r\nwere 43 killed and 139 wounded; 130 officers and men died from cholera;\r\nand there were 126 deaths from other causes. A large number of British\r\nofficers were also invalided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: THE DESERT RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt often happens that in prosperous public enterprises the applause of\r\nthe nation and the rewards of the sovereign are bestowed on those whose\r\noffices are splendid and whose duties have been dramatic. Others whose\r\nlabours were no less difficult, responsible, and vital to success are\r\nunnoticed. If this be true of men, it is also true of things. In a tale\r\nof war the reader's mind is filled with the fighting. The battle--with\r\nits vivid scenes, its moving incidents, its plain and tremendous\r\nresults--excites imagination and commands attention. The eye is fixed\r\non the fighting brigades as they move amid the smoke; on the swarming\r\nfigures of the enemy; on the General, serene and determined, mounted\r\nin the middle of his Staff. The long trailing line of communications\r\nis unnoticed. The fierce glory that plays on red, triumphant bayonets\r\ndazzles the observer; nor does he care to look behind to where, along a\r\nthousand miles of rail, road, and river, the convoys are crawling to\r\nthe front in uninterrupted succession. Victory is the beautiful,\r\nbright-coloured flower. Transport is the stem without which it could\r\nnever have blossomed. Yet even the military student, in his zeal to\r\nmaster the fascinating combinations of the actual conflict, often\r\nforgets the far more intricate complications of supply.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that a battle, the climax to which all military\r\noperations tend, is an event which is not controlled by strategy or\r\norganisation. The scheme may be well planned, the troops well fed, the\r\nammunition plentiful, and the enemy entangled, famished, or numerically\r\ninferior. The glorious uncertainties of the field can yet reverse\r\neverything. The human element--in defiance of experience and\r\nprobability--may produce a wholly irrational result, and a starving,\r\nout-manœuvred army win food, safety, and honour by their bravery. But\r\nsuch considerations apply with greater force to wars where both sides\r\nare equal in equipment and discipline. In savage warfare in a flat\r\ncountry the power of modern machinery is such that flesh and blood can\r\nscarcely prevail, and the chances of battle are reduced to a minimum.\r\nFighting the Dervishes was primarily a matter of transport. The Khalifa\r\nwas conquered on the railway.\r\n\r\nHitherto, as the operations have progressed, it has been convenient to\r\nspeak of the railway in a general manner as having been laid or extended\r\nto various points, and merely to indicate the direction of the lines\r\nof communication. The reader is now invited to take a closer view.\r\nThis chapter is concerned with boats, railways, and pack animals, but\r\nparticularly with railways.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Dongola campaign in 1896 the Nile was the main channel of\r\ncommunication between the Expeditionary Force and its base in Egypt.\r\nAll supplies were brought to the front as far as possible by water\r\ntransport. Wherever the Nile was navigable, it was used. Other means of\r\nconveyance--by railways and pack animals--though essential, were merely\r\nsupplementary. Boats carry more and cost less than any other form of\r\ntransport. The service is not so liable to interruption; the plant needs\r\nonly simple repair; the waterway is ready-made. But the Nile is not\r\nalways available. Frequent cataracts obstruct its course for many miles.\r\nOther long reaches are only navigable when the river is in flood. To\r\njoin the navigable reaches, and thus preserve the continuity of the\r\ncommunications, a complex system of railways and caravans was necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the expedition to Dongola a line of railway was required to connect\r\nthe two navigable reaches of the Nile which extend from Assuan to Wady\r\nHalfa, and from Kerma to Merawi. Before the capture of Dongola, however,\r\nthis distance was shortened by the fact that the river at high Nile is\r\nnavigable between the Third Cataract and Kerma. In consequence it was at\r\nfirst only necessary to construct the stretch of 108 miles between Wady\r\nHalfa and Kosheh. During the years when Wady Halfa was the southernmost\r\ngarrison of the Egyptian forces a strong post had been maintained at\r\nSarras. In the Nile expeditions of 1885 the railway from Halfa had been\r\ncompleted through Sarras and as far as Akasha, a distance of eighty-six\r\nmiles. After the abandonment of the Soudan the Dervishes destroyed the\r\nline as far north as Sarras. The old embankments were still standing,\r\nbut the sleepers had been burnt and the rails torn up, and in many cases\r\nbent or twisted. The position in 1896 may, in fact, be summed up as\r\nfollows: The section of thirty-three miles from Wady Halfa to Sarras was\r\nimmediately available and in working order. The section of fifty-three\r\nmiles from Sarras to Akasha required partial reconstruction. The section\r\nof thirty-two miles from Akasha to Kosheh must, with the exception of\r\nten miles of embankment completed in 1885, at once be newly made. And,\r\nfinally, the section from Kosheh to Kerma must be completed before the\r\nNile flood subsided.\r\n\r\nThe first duty, therefore, which the Engineer officers had to perform\r\nwas the reconstruction of the line from Sarras to Akasha. No trained\r\nstaff or skilled workmen were available. The lack of men with technical\r\nknowledge was doubtfully supplied by the enlistment of a 'Railway\r\nBattalion' 800 strong. These men were drawn from many tribes and\r\nclasses. Their only qualification was capacity and willingness for work.\r\nThey presented a motley appearance. Dervish prisoners, released but\r\nstill wearing their jibbas, assisted stalwart Egyptians in unloading\r\nrails and sleepers. Dinkas, Shillooks, Jaalin, and Barabras shovelled\r\ncontentedly together at the embankments. One hundred civilian\r\nSoudanese--chiefly time-expired soldiers--were also employed; and these,\r\nsince they were trustworthy and took an especial pride in their work,\r\nsoon learned the arts of spiking rails and sleepers, fishing rails\r\ntogether, and straightening. To direct and control the labours of\r\nthese men of varied race and language, but of equal inexperience, some\r\ncivilian foremen platelayers were obtained at high rates of pay\r\nfrom Lower Egypt. These, however, with very few exceptions were not\r\nsatisfactory, and they were gradually replaced by intelligent men of the\r\n'Railway Battalion,' who had learned their trade as the line progressed.\r\nThe projection, direction, and execution of the whole work were\r\nentrusted to a few subalterns of Engineers, of whom the best-known was\r\nEdouard Girouard.\r\n\r\nWork was begun south of Sarras at the latter end of March. At first\r\nthe efforts of so many unskilled workmen, instructed by few experienced\r\nofficers, were productive of results ridiculous rather than important.\r\nGradually, however, the knowledge and energy of the young director and\r\nthe intelligence and devotion of his still more youthful subordinates\r\nbegan to take effect. The pace of construction increased, and the labour\r\nwas lightened by the contrivances of experience and skill.\r\n\r\nAs the line grew longer, native officers and non-commissioned officers\r\nfrom the active and reserve lists of the Egyptian Army were appointed\r\nstation-masters. Intelligent non-commissioned officers and men were\r\nconverted into shunters, guards, and pointsmen. Traffic was controlled\r\nby telephone. To work the telephone, men were discovered who could read\r\nand write--very often who could read and write only their own names, and\r\neven that with such difficulty that they usually preferred a seal. They\r\ndeveloped into clerks by a simple process of selection. To improve their\r\neducation, and to train a staff in the office work of a railway, two\r\nschools were instituted at Halfa. In these establishments, which were\r\nformed by the shade of two palm-trees, twenty pupils received the\r\nbeginnings of knowledge. The simplicity of the instruction was aided by\r\nthe zeal of the students, and learning grew beneath the palm-trees more\r\nquickly perhaps than in the magnificent schools of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe rolling stock of the Halfa-Sarras line was in good order and\r\nsufficient quantity, but the eight locomotives were out of all repair,\r\nand had to be patched up again and again with painful repetition. The\r\nregularity of their break-downs prevented the regularity of the road,\r\nand the Soudan military railway gained a doubtful reputation during the\r\nDongola expedition and in its early days. Nor were there wanting those\r\nwho employed their wits in scoffing at the undertaking and in pouring\r\nthoughtless indignation on the engineers. Nevertheless the work went on\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\nThe initial difficulties of the task were aggravated by an unexpected\r\ncalamity. On the 26th of August the violent cyclonic rain-storm of which\r\nsome account has been given in the last chapter broke over the Dongola\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nA writer on the earlier phases of the war [A. Hilliard Atteridge,\r\nTOWARDS FREEDOM.] has forcibly explained why the consequences were so\r\nserious:\r\n\r\n'In a country where rain is an ordinary event the engineer lays his\r\nrailway line, not in the bottom of a valley, but at a higher level on\r\none slope or the other. Where he passes across branching side valleys,\r\nhe takes care to leave in all his embankments large culverts to carry\r\noff flood-water. But here, in what was thought to be the rainless\r\nSoudan, the line south of Sarras followed for mile after mile the bottom\r\nof the long valley of Khor Ahrusa, and no provision had been made, or\r\nhad been thought necessary, for culverts in the embankments where minor\r\nhollows were crossed. Thus, when the flood came, it was not merely that\r\nthe railway was cut through here and there by the rushing deluge. It was\r\ncovered deep in water, the ballast was swept away, and some of the banks\r\nso destroyed that in places rails and sleepers were left hanging in the\r\nair across a wide gap.'\r\n\r\nNearly fourteen miles of track were destroyed. The camp of the\r\nconstruction gangs was wrecked and flooded. Some of the rifles of the\r\nescort--for the conditions of war were never absent--were afterwards\r\nrecovered from a depth of three feet of sand. In one place, where the\r\nembankment had partly withstood the deluge, a great lake several miles\r\nsquare appeared. By extraordinary exertions the damage was repaired in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the line as far as Kosheh was completed, the advance towards\r\nDongola began. After the army had been victorious at Hafir the whole\r\nprovince was cleared of Dervishes, and the Egyptian forces pushed on to\r\nMerawi. Here they were dependent on river transport. But the Nile was\r\nfalling rapidly, and the army were soon in danger of being stranded by\r\nthe interruption of river traffic between the Third Cataract and Kenna.\r\nThe extension of the line from Kosheh to Kerma was therefore of vital\r\nimportance. The survey was at once undertaken, and a suitable route\r\nwas chosen through the newly acquired and unmapped territory. Of the\r\nninety-five miles of extended track, fifty-six were through the desert,\r\nand the constructors here gained the experience which was afterwards\r\nof value on the great Desert Railway from Wady Halfa to the Atbara.\r\nBattalions of troops were distributed along the line and ordered to\r\nbegin to make the embankments. Track-laying commenced south of Kosheh on\r\nthe 9th of October, and the whole work was carried forward with feverish\r\nenergy. As it progressed, and before it was completed, the reach of the\r\nriver from the Third Cataract to Kenna ceased to be navigable. The army\r\nwere now dependent for their existence on the partly finished railway,\r\nfrom the head of which supplies were conveyed by an elaborate system of\r\ncamel transport. Every week the line grew, Railhead moved forward, and\r\nthe strain upon the pack animals diminished. But the problem of feeding\r\nthe field army without interfering with the railway construction was one\r\nof extraordinary intricacy and difficulty. The carrying capacity of the\r\nline was strictly limited. The worn-out engines frequently broke down.\r\nOn many occasions only three were in working order, and the other five\r\nundergoing 'heavy repairs' which might secure them another short span\r\nof usefulness. Three times the construction had to be suspended to allow\r\nthe army to be revictualled. Every difficulty was, however, overcome.\r\nBy the beginning of May the line to Kenna was finished, and the whole\r\nof the Railway Battalion, its subalterns and its director, turned their\r\nattention to a greater enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the first week in December the Sirdar returned from England with\r\ninstructions or permission to continue the advance towards Khartoum,\r\nand the momentous question of the route to be followed arose. It may at\r\nfirst seem that the plain course was to continue to work along the Nile,\r\nconnecting its navigable reaches by sections of railway. But from Merawi\r\nto Abu Hamed the river is broken by continual cataracts, and the\r\nbroken ground of both banks made a railway nearly an impossibility. The\r\nmovements of the French expeditions towards the Upper Nile counselled\r\nspeed. The poverty of Egypt compelled economy. The Nile route, though\r\nsure, would be slow and very expensive. A short cut must be found. Three\r\ndaring and ambitious schemes presented themselves: (1) the line followed\r\nby the Desert Column in 1884 from Korti to Metemma; (2) the celebrated,\r\nif not notorious, route from Suakin to Berber; (3) across the Nubian\r\ndesert from Korosko or Wady Halfa to Abu Hamed.\r\n\r\nThe question involved the whole strategy of the war. No more important\r\ndecision was ever taken by Sir Herbert Kitchener, whether in office or\r\nin action. The request for a British division, the attack On Mahmud's\r\nzeriba, the great left wheel towards Omdurman during that battle, the\r\ntreatment of the Marchand expedition, were matters of lesser resolve\r\nthan the selection of the line of advance. The known strength of the\r\nKhalifa made it evident that a powerful force would be required for\r\nthe destruction of his army and the capture of his capital. The use of\r\nrailway transport to some point on the Nile whence there was a clear\r\nwaterway was therefore imperative. Berber and Metemma were known, and\r\nAbu Hamed was believed, to fulfil this condition. But both Berber and\r\nMetemma were important strategic points. It was improbable that the\r\nDervishes would abandon these keys to Khartoum and the Soudan without\r\nsevere resistance. It seemed likely, indeed, that the Khalifa would\r\nstrongly reinforce both towns, and desperately contest their possession.\r\nThe deserts between Korti and Metemma, and between Suakin and Berber,\r\ncontained scattered wells, and small raiding parties might have cut the\r\nrailway and perhaps have starved the army at its head. It was therefore\r\ntoo dangerous to project the railway towards either Berber or Metemma\r\nuntil they were actually in our hands. The argument is circular. The\r\ntowns could not be taken without a strong force; so strong a force could\r\nnot advance until the railway was made; and the railway could not be\r\nmade till the towns were taken.\r\n\r\nBoth the Korti-Metemma and the Suakin-Berber routes were therefore\r\nrejected. The resolution to exclude the latter was further strengthened\r\nby the fact that the labour of building a railway over the hills behind\r\nSuakin would have been very great.\r\n\r\nThe route via Abu Hamed was selected by the exclusion of the\r\nalternatives. But it had distinct and apparent advantages. Abu Hamed\r\nwas within striking distance of the army at Merawi. It was not a point\r\nessential to the Dervish defences, and not, therefore, likely to be\r\nso strongly garrisoned as Berber or Metemma. It might, therefore, be\r\ncaptured by a column marching along the river, and sufficiently small\r\nto be equipped with only camel transport. The deserts through which\r\nthe railway to Abu Hamed would pass contain few wells, and therefore it\r\nwould be difficult for small raiding parties to cut the line or attack\r\nthe construction gangs; and before the line got within reach of the\r\nDervish garrison at Abu Hamed, that garrison would be dislodged and the\r\nplace seized.\r\n\r\nThe plan was perfect, and the argument in its favour conclusive. It\r\nturned, however, on one point: Was the Desert Railway a possibility?\r\nWith this question the General was now confronted. He appealed to expert\r\nopinion. Eminent railway engineers in England were consulted. They\r\nreplied with unanimity that, having due regard to the circumstances, and\r\nremembering the conditions of war under which the work must be executed,\r\nit was impossible to construct such a line. Distinguished soldiers were\r\napproached on the subject. They replied that the scheme was not only\r\nimpossible, but absurd. Many other persons who were not consulted\r\nvolunteered the opinion that the whole idea was that of a lunatic, and\r\npredicted ruin and disaster to the expedition. Having received this\r\nadvice, and reflected on it duly, the Sirdar ordered the railway to be\r\nconstructed without more delay.\r\n\r\nA further question immediately arose: Should the railway to Abu Hamed\r\nstart from Korosko or from Wady Halfa? There were arguments on both\r\nsides. The adoption of the Korosko line would reduce the river stage\r\nfrom Assuan by forty-eight hours up stream. The old caravan route, by\r\nwhich General Gordon had travelled to Khartoum on his last journey, had\r\nbeen from Korosko via Murat Wells to Abu Hamed. On the other hand, many\r\nworkshops and appliances for construction were already existing at Wady\r\nHalfa. It was the northern terminus of the Dongola railway. This was an\r\nenormous advantage. Both routes were reconnoitred: that from Wady Halfa\r\nwas selected. The decision having been taken, the enterprise was at once\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Girouard, to whom everything was entrusted, was told to make\r\nthe necessary estimates. Sitting in his hut at Wady Halfa, he drew up a\r\ncomprehensive list. Nothing was forgotten. Every want was provided for;\r\nevery difficulty was foreseen; every requisite was noted. The questions\r\nto be decided were numerous and involved. How much carrying capacity was\r\nrequired? How much rolling stock? How many engines? What spare parts?\r\nHow much oil? How many lathes? How many cutters? How many punching and\r\nshearing machines? What arrangements of signals would be necessary?\r\nHow many lamps? How many points? How many trolleys? What amount of coal\r\nshould be ordered? How much water would be wanted? How should it be\r\ncarried? To what extent would its carriage affect the hauling power and\r\ninfluence all previous calculations? How much railway plant was needed?\r\nHow many miles of rail? How many thousand sleepers? Where could they be\r\nprocured at such short notice? How many fishplates were necessary?\r\nWhat tools would be required? What appliances? What machinery? How much\r\nskilled labour was wanted? How much of the class of labour available?\r\nHow were the workmen to be fed and watered? How much food would they\r\nwant? How many trains a day must be run to feed them and their escort?\r\nHow many must be run to carry plant? How did these requirements affect\r\nthe estimate for rolling stock? The answers to all these questions, and\r\nto many others with which I will not inflict the reader, were set forth\r\nby Lieutenant Girouard in a ponderous volume several inches thick; and\r\nsuch was the comprehensive accuracy of the estimate that the working\r\nparties were never delayed by the want even of a piece of brass wire.\r\n\r\nIn any circumstances the task would have been enormous. It was, however,\r\ncomplicated by five important considerations: It had to be executed with\r\nmilitary precautions. There was apparently no water along the line. The\r\nfeeding of 2,000 platelayers in a barren desert was a problem in itself.\r\nThe work had to be completed before the winter. And, finally, the money\r\nvoted was not to be outrun. The Sirdar attended to the last condition.\r\n\r\nGirouard was sent to England to buy the plant and rolling stock. Fifteen\r\nnew engines and two hundred trucks were ordered. The necessary new\r\nworkshops were commenced at Halfa. Experienced mechanics were procured\r\nto direct them. Fifteen hundred additional men were enlisted in the\r\nRailway Battalion and trained. Then the water question was dealt\r\nwith. The reconnoitring surveys had reported that though the line\r\nwas certainly 'good and easy' for 110 miles--and, according to Arab\r\naccounts, for the remaining 120 miles--no drop of water was to be found,\r\nand only two likely spots for wells were noted. Camel transport was, of\r\ncourse, out of the question. Each engine must first of all haul enough\r\nwater to carry it to Railhead and back, besides a reserve against\r\naccidents. It was evident that the quantity of water required by any\r\nlocomotive would continually increase as the work progressed and the\r\ndistance grew greater, until finally the material trains would have\r\none-third of their carrying power absorbed in transporting the water\r\nfor their own consumption. The amount of water necessary is largely\r\ndependent on the grades of the line. The 'flat desert' proved to be\r\na steady slope up to a height of 1,600 feet above Halfa, and the\r\ncalculations were further complicated. The difficulty had, however, to\r\nbe faced, and a hundred 1,500-gallon tanks were procured. These\r\nwere mounted on trucks and connected by hose; and the most striking\r\ncharacteristic of the trains of the Soudan military railway was the long\r\nsuccession of enormous boxes on wheels, on which the motive power of the\r\nengine and the lives of the passengers depended.\r\n\r\nThe first spadeful of sand of the Desert Railway was turned on the first\r\nday of 1897; but until May, when the line to Kerma was finished, no\r\ngreat efforts were made, and only forty miles of track had been laid. In\r\nthe meanwhile the men of the new Railway Battalion were being trained;\r\nthe plant was steadily accumulating; engines, rolling stock, and\r\nmaterial of all sorts had arrived from England. From the growing\r\nworkshops at Wady Halfa the continual clatter and clang of hammers and\r\nthe black smoke of manufacture rose to the African sky. The malodorous\r\nincense of civilisation was offered to the startled gods of Egypt. All\r\nthis was preparation; nor was it until the 8th of May that track-laying\r\ninto the desert was begun in earnest. The whole of the construction\r\ngangs and railroad staff were brought from Kerma to Wady Halfa, and the\r\ndaring pioneers of modern war started on their long march through the\r\nwilderness, dragging their railway behind them--safe and sure road\r\nwhich infantry, cavalry, guns, and gunboats might follow with speed and\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely within the power of words to describe the savage\r\ndesolation of the regions into which the line and its constructors\r\nplunged. A smooth ocean of bright-coloured sand spread far and wide to\r\ndistant horizons. The tropical sun beat with senseless perseverance upon\r\nthe level surface until it could scarcely be touched with a naked hand,\r\nand the filmy air glittered and shimmered as over a furnace. Here and\r\nthere huge masses of crumbling rock rose from the plain, like islands of\r\ncinders in a sea of fire. Alone in this vast expanse stood Railhead--a\r\ncanvas town of 2,500 inhabitants, complete with station, stores,\r\npost-office, telegraph-office, and canteen, and only connected with the\r\nliving world of men and ideas by two parallel iron streaks, three feet\r\nsix inches apart, growing dim and narrower in a long perspective\r\nuntil they were twisted and blurred by the mirage and vanished in the\r\nindefinite distance.\r\n\r\nEvery morning in the remote nothingness there appeared a black speck\r\ngrowing larger and clearer, until with a whistle and a welcome clatter,\r\namid the aching silence of ages, the 'material' train arrived, carrying\r\nits own water and 2,500 yards of rails, sleepers, and accessories. At\r\nnoon came another speck, developing in a similar manner into a\r\nsupply train, also carrying its own water, food and water for the\r\nhalf-battalion of the escort and the 2,000 artificers and platelayers,\r\nand the letters, newspapers, sausages, jam, whisky, soda-water,\r\nand cigarettes which enable the Briton to conquer the world without\r\ndiscomfort. And presently the empty trains would depart, reversing the\r\nprocess of their arrival, and vanishing gradually along a line which\r\nappeared at last to turn up into the air and run at a tangent into an\r\nunreal world.\r\n\r\nThe life of the strange and lonely town was characterised by a\r\nmachine-like regularity, born perhaps of the iron road from which it\r\nderived its nourishment. Daily at three o'clock in the morning the\r\n'camp-engine' started with the 'bank parties.' With the dawn the\r\n'material' train arrived, the platelaying gangs swarmed over it like\r\nclusters of flies, and were carried to the extreme limit of the track.\r\nEvery man knew his task, and knew, too, that he would return to camp\r\nwhen it was finished, and not before. Forthwith they set busily to\r\nwork without the necessity of an order. A hundred yards of material was\r\nunloaded. The sleepers were arranged in a long succession. The rails\r\nwere spiked to every alternate sleeper, and then the great 80-ton engine\r\nmoved cautiously forward along the unballasted track, like an elephant\r\ntrying a doubtful bridge. The operation was repeated continually through\r\nthe hours of the burning day. Behind the train there followed other\r\ngangs of platelayers, who completed the spiking and ballasting process;\r\nand when the sun sank beneath the sands of the western horizon, and the\r\nengine pushed the empty trucks and the weary men home to the Railhead\r\ncamp, it came back over a finished and permanent line. There was a brief\r\ninterval while the camp-fires twinkled in the waste, like the lights\r\nof a liner in mid-ocean, while the officers and men chatted over their\r\nevening meal, and then the darkness and silence of the desert was\r\nunbroken till morning brought the glare and toil of another long day.\r\n\r\nSo, week in, week out, the work went on. Every few days saw a\r\nfurther advance into the wilderness. The scene changed and remained\r\nunaltered--'another, yet the same.' As Wady Halfa became more remote and\r\nAbu Hamed grew near, an element of danger, the more appalling since\r\nit was peculiar, was added to the strange conditions under which the\r\ninhabitants of Railhead lived. What if the Dervishes should cut the line\r\nbehind them? They had three days' reserve of water. After that, unless\r\nthe obstruction were removed and traffic restored, all must wither\r\nand die in the sand, and only their bones and their cooking-pots would\r\nattest the folly of their undertaking.\r\n\r\nBy the 20th of July a hundred and thirty miles of line had been\r\nfinished, and it became too dangerous to advance further until Abu Hamed\r\nhad been cleared of the Dervish force. They were still a hundred miles\r\naway, but camels travel fast and far, and the resources of the enemy\r\nwere uncertain. It appeared that progress would be checked, but on the\r\n7th of August General Hunter, marching from Merawi along the river\r\nbank, attacked and took Abu Hamed--an operation which will be described\r\nhereafter. Work was at once resumed with renewed energy. The pace of\r\nconstruction now became remarkable. As much as 5,300 yards of track was\r\nsurveyed, embanked, and laid in a single day. On the 1st of November Abu\r\nHamed was reached, and by the banks of the Nile the men who had fought\r\ntheir way across the desert joined hands with those who had fought their\r\nway along the river.\r\n\r\nThe strain and hardship had not, however, been without effect on the\r\nconstructors. Two of the Engineer subalterns--Polwhele and Cator--out of\r\nthe eight concerned in the laying of the Dongola and the Desert railways\r\nhad died. Their places were eagerly filled by others.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the line was accelerated by nearly a month through the\r\nfortunate discovery of water. At the beginning of July a well was\r\nsunk in what was thought to be a likely place at 'No. 4 Station,'\r\nseventy-seven miles from Halfa. After five weeks' work water was found\r\nin abundance at a depth of 90 feet. A steam-pump was erected, and the\r\nwell yielded a continual supply. In October a second well was sunk at\r\n'No. 6 Station,' fifty-five miles further on, whence water was obtained\r\nin still greater quantity. These discoveries modified, though they did\r\nnot solve, the water question. They substantially increased the carrying\r\ncapacity of the line, and reduced the danger to which the construction\r\ngangs were exposed. The sinking of the wells, an enterprise at which the\r\nfriendly Arabs scoffed, was begun on the Sirdar's personal initiative;\r\nbut the chronicler must impartially observe that the success was won\r\nby luck as much as by calculation, for, since the first two wells were\r\nmade, eight others of greater depth have been bored and in no case has\r\nwater been obtained.\r\n\r\nAs the railway had been made, the telegraph-wire had, of course,\r\nfollowed it. Every consignment of rails and sleepers had been\r\naccompanied by its proportion of telegraph-poles, insulators, and wire.\r\nAnother subaltern of Engineers, Lieutenant Manifold, who managed this\r\npart of the military operations against the Arabs, had also laid a line\r\nfrom Merawi to Abu Hamed, so that immediate correspondence was effected\r\nround the entire circle of rail and river.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the Railway Battalion and its officers did not end with\r\nthe completion of the line to Abu Hamed. The Desert Railway was made. It\r\nhad now to be maintained, worked, and rapidly extended. The terminus\r\nat Halfa had become a busy town. A mud village was transformed into a\r\nminiature Crewe. The great workshops that had grown with the line\r\nwere equipped with diverse and elaborate machines. Plant of all kinds\r\npurchased in Cairo or requisitioned from England, with odds and\r\nends collected from Ishmail's scrap heaps, filled the depots with\r\nan extraordinary variety of stores. Foundries, lathes, dynamos,\r\nsteam-hammers, hydraulic presses, cupola furnaces, screw-cutting\r\nmachines, and drills had been set up and were in continual work. They\r\nneeded constant attention. Every appliance for repairing each must be\r\nprovided. To haul the tonnage necessary to supply the army and extend\r\nthe line nearly forty engines were eventually required. Purchased at\r\ndifferent times and from different countries, they included ten distinct\r\npatterns; each pattern needed a special reserve of spare parts. The\r\npermutations and combinations of the stores were multiplied. Some of the\r\nengines were old and already worn out. These broke down periodically.\r\nThe frictional parts of all were affected by the desert sand, and needed\r\nceaseless attention and repair. The workshops were busy night and day\r\nfor seven days a week.\r\n\r\nTo the complication of machinery was added the confusion of tongues.\r\nNatives of various races were employed as operatives. Foremen had been\r\nobtained from Europe. No fewer than seven separate languages were spoken\r\nin the shops. Wady Halfa became a second Babel. Yet the undertaking\r\nprospered. The Engineer officers displayed qualities of tact and temper:\r\ntheir director was cool and indefatigable. Over all the Sirdar\r\nexercised a regular control. Usually ungracious, rarely impatient,\r\nnever unreasonable, he moved among the workshops and about the line,\r\nsatisfying himself that all was proceeding with economy and despatch.\r\nThe sympathy of common labour won him the affection of the subalterns.\r\nNowhere in the Soudan was he better known than on the railroad. Nowhere\r\nwas he so ardently believed in.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to anticipate the course of events. As soon as the\r\nrailway reached Abu Hamed, General Hunter's force, which was holding\r\nthat place, dropped its slender camel communications with Merawi and\r\ndrew its supplies along the new line direct from Wady Halfa. After the\r\ncompletion of the desert line there was still left seventeen miles of\r\nmaterial for construction, and the railway was consequently at once\r\nextended to Dakhesh, sixteen miles south of Abu Hamed. Meanwhile Berber\r\nwas seized, and military considerations compelled the concentration of\r\na larger force to maintain that town. The four battalions which had\r\nremained at Merawi were floated down stream to Kerma, and, there\r\nentraining, were carried by Halfa and Abu Hamed to Dakhesh--a journey of\r\n450 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen the railway had been begun across the desert, it was believed that\r\nthe Nile was always navigable above Abu Hamed. In former campaigns it\r\nhad been reconnoitred and the waterway declared clear. But as the river\r\nfell it became evident that this was untrue. With the subsidence of the\r\nwaters cataracts began to appear, and to avoid these it became necessary\r\nfirst of all to extend the railway to Bashtinab, later on to Abadia, and\r\nfinally to the Atbara. To do this more money had to be obtained, and the\r\nusual financial difficulties presented themselves. Finally, however, the\r\nmatter was settled, and the extension began at the rate of about a mile\r\na day. The character of the country varies considerably between Abu\r\nHamed and the Atbara River. For the first sixty miles the line ran\r\nbeside the Nile, at the edge of the riparian belt. On the right was the\r\ncultivable though mostly uncultivated strip, long neglected and silted\r\nup with fine sand drifted into dunes, from which scattered, scraggy\r\ndom palms and prickly mimosa bushes grew. Between the branches of these\r\nsombre trees the river gleamed, a cool and attractive flood. On the left\r\nwas the desert, here broken by frequent rocks and dry watercourses. From\r\nBashtinab to Abadia another desert section of fifty miles was necessary\r\nto avoid some very difficult ground by the Nile bank. From Abadia to the\r\nAtbara the last stretch of the line runs across a broad alluvial expanse\r\nfrom whose surface plane-trees of mean appearance, but affording welcome\r\nshade, rise, watered by the autumn rains. The fact that the railway\r\nwas approaching regions where rain is not an almost unknown phenomenon\r\nincreased the labour of construction. To prevent the embankments from\r\nbeing washed away in the watercourses, ten bridges and sixty culverts\r\nhad to be made; and this involved the transport over the railway of more\r\nthan 1,000 tons of material in addition to the ordinary plant.\r\n\r\nBy the arrival of the reinforcements at Berber the fighting force at the\r\nfront was doubled: doubled also was the business of supply. The task of\r\nproviding the food of an army in a desert, a thousand miles from their\r\nbase, and with no apparent means of subsistence at the end of the day's\r\nmarch, is less picturesque, though not less important, than the building\r\nof railways along which that nourishment is drawn to the front. Supply\r\nand transport stand or fall together; history depends on both; and in\r\norder to explain the commissariat aspect of the River War, I must again\r\nboth repeat and anticipate the account. The Sirdar exercised a direct\r\nand personal supervision over the whole department of supply, but\r\nhis action was restricted almost entirely to the distribution of the\r\nrations. Their accumulation and regular supply were the task of Colonel\r\nRogers, and this officer, by three years of exact calculation and\r\nunfailing allowance for the unforeseen, has well deserved his high\r\nreputation as a feeder of armies.\r\n\r\nThe first military necessity of the war was, as has been described, to\r\nplace the bulk of the Egyptian army at Akasha. In ordinary circumstances\r\nthis would not have been a serious commissariat problem. The frontier\r\nreserves of food were calculated to meet such an emergency. But in 1895\r\nthe crops in Egypt had been much below the average. At the beginning of\r\n1896 there was a great scarcity of grain. When the order for the advance\r\nwas issued, the frontier grain stores were nearly exhausted. The new\r\ncrops could not be garnered until the end of April. Thus while the world\r\nregarded Egypt as a vast granary, her soldiers were obliged to purchase\r\n4,000 tons of doura and 1,000 tons of barley from India and Russia on\r\nwhich to begin the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe chief item of a soldier's diet in most armies is bread. In several\r\nof our wars the health, and consequently the efficiency, of the troops\r\nhas been impaired by bad bread or by the too frequent substitution of\r\nhard biscuit. For more than a year the army up the river ate 20 tons\r\nof flour daily, and it is easy to imagine how bitter amid ordinary\r\ncircumstances would have been the battle between the commissariat\r\nofficers, whose duty it was to insist on proper quality, and the\r\ncontractors--often, I fear, meriting the epithet 'rascally'--intent\r\nonly upon profit. But in the well-managed Egyptian Service no such\r\ndifficulties arose. The War Department had in 1892 converted one of\r\nIsmail Pasha's gun factories near Cairo into a victualling-yard.\r\nHere were set up their own mills for grinding flour, machinery for\r\nmanufacturing biscuit to the extent of 60,000 rations daily, and\r\neven for making soap. Three great advantages sprang from this wise\r\narrangement. Firstly, the good quality of the supply was assured.\r\nComplaints about bread and biscuit were practically unknown, and the\r\nsoap--since the soldier, in contrast to the mixture of rubble and grease\r\nwith which the contractors had formerly furnished him, could actually\r\nwash himself and his clothes with it--was greatly prized. Secondly, all\r\nrisk of contractors failing to deliver in time was avoided. Lastly,\r\nthe funds resulting from the economy had been utilised to form a useful\r\ncorps of 150 bakers. And thus, although the purchase of foreign grain\r\nadded to the expense, the beginning of the war found the commissariat of\r\nthe Egyptian Army in a thoroughly efficient state.\r\n\r\nVast reserves of stores were quickly accumulated at Assuan. From these\r\nnot an ounce of food was issued without the Sirdar's direct sanction. At\r\nthe subsidiary depot, formed at Wady Halfa, the same rule prevailed. The\r\nman who was responsible to no one took all the responsibility; and\r\nthe system whereby a Chief of the Staff is subjected to the continual\r\nbombardment of heads of departments was happily avoided. Sufficient\r\nsupplies having been accumulated at Akasha to allow of a forward\r\nmovement, Firket was fought. After Firket the situation became\r\ndifficult, and the problem of the supply officers was to keep the troops\r\nalive without delaying the progress of the railway with the carriage of\r\ntheir food. A small quantity of provisions was painfully dragged, with\r\nan average loss of 50 per cent from theft and water damage, up the\r\nsuccession of cataracts which obstruct the river-way from Halfa to\r\nKosheh. Camel convoys from Railhead carried the rest. But until the line\r\nreached Kosheh the resources of the transport were terribly strained,\r\nand at one time it was even necessary to send the mounted troops north\r\nto avoid actual famine. The apparent inadequacy of the means to the end\r\nreached a climax when the army moved southward from Dulgo. The marches\r\nand halts to Dongola were estimated to take ten days, which was the\r\nutmost capacity of camel and steam transport, A few boat-loads of\r\ngrain might be captured; a few handfuls of dates might be plucked; but\r\nscarcely any local supplies would be available. The sailing-boats,\r\nwhich were the only regular means of transport, were all delayed by the\r\nadverse winds. Fortune returned at the critical moment. By good luck\r\non the first day of the march the north wind began to blow, and twelve\r\ndays' supplies, over and above those moved by camel and steamer, reached\r\nDongola with the troops. With this reserve in hand, the occupation of\r\nthe province was completed, and although the army only existed from hand\r\nto mouth until the railway reached Kerma, no further serious difficulty\r\nwas experienced in supplying them.\r\n\r\nThe account of the commissariat is now complete to the end of the\r\nDongola Expedition; but it may conveniently be carried forward with\r\nthe railway construction. In the Abu Hamed phase the supplies were so\r\nregulated that a convoy travelling from Murat Wells along the caravan\r\nroute arrived the day after the fight; and thereafter communications\r\nwere opened with Merawi. The unexpected occupation of Berber, following\r\nAbu Hamed, created the most difficult situation of the war. Until the\r\nrailway was forced on to Berber a peculiarly inconvenient line of supply\r\nhad to be used; and strings of camels, scattering never less than 30\r\nper cent of their loads, meandered through the rough and thorny country\r\nbetween Merawi and Abu Hamed. This line was strengthened by other\r\nconvoys from Murat and the approaching Railhead, and a system of boats\r\nand camel portages filtered the supplies to their destination.\r\n\r\nEven when the railway had reached Dakhesh the tension was only slightly\r\nrelaxed. The necessity of supplying the large force at Berber, 108 miles\r\nfrom Railhead, still required the maintenance of a huge and complicated\r\nsystem of boat and camel transport. Of course, as the railway advanced,\r\nit absorbed stage after stage of river and portage, and the difficulties\r\ndecreased. But the reader may gain some idea of their magnitude by\r\nfollowing the progress of a box of biscuits from Cairo to Berber in the\r\nmonth of December 1897. The route was as follows: From Cairo to Nagh\r\nHamadi (340 miles) by rail; from Nagh Hamadi to Assuan (205 miles) by\r\nboat; from Assuan to Shellal (6 miles) by rail; from Shellal to Halfa\r\n(226 miles) by boat; from Halfa to Dakhesh (Railhead)--248 miles--by\r\nmilitary railway; from Dakhesh to Shereik (45 miles) by boat; from\r\nShereik by camel (13 miles) round a cataract to Bashtinab; from\r\nBashtinab by boat (25 miles) to Omsheyo; from Omsheyo round another\r\nimpracticable reach (11 miles) by camel to Geneinetti, and thence (22\r\nmiles) to Berber by boat. The road taken by this box of biscuits was\r\nfollowed by every ton of supplies required by 10,000 men in the field.\r\nThe uninterrupted working of the long and varied chain was vital to\r\nthe welfare of the army and the success of the war. It could only be\r\nmaintained if every section was adequately supplied and none were either\r\nchoked or starved. This problem had to be solved correctly every day by\r\nthe transport officers, in spite of uncertain winds that retarded the\r\nboats, of camels that grew sick or died, and of engines that repeatedly\r\nbroke down. In the face of every difficulty a regular supply was\r\nmaintained. The construction of the railway was not delayed, nor the\r\nfood of the troops reduced.\r\n\r\nThe line continued to grow rapidly, and as it grew the difficulties of\r\nsupply decreased. The weight was shifted from the backs of the camels\r\nand the bottoms of the sailing-boats to the trucks of the iron road. The\r\nstrong hands of steam were directed to the prosecution of the war,\r\nand the swiftness of the train replaced the toilsome plodding of\r\nthe caravan. The advance of the Dervishes towards Berber checked\r\nthe progress of the railway. Military precautions were imperative.\r\nConstruction was delayed by the passage of the 1st British Brigade from\r\nCairo to the front, and by the consequently increased volume of daily\r\nsupplies. By the 10th of March, however, the line was completed to\r\nBashtinab. On the 5th of May it had reached Abadia. On the 3rd of July\r\nthe whole railway from Wady Halfa to the Atbara was finished, and the\r\nsouthern terminus was established in the great entrenched camp at the\r\nconfluence of the rivers. The question of supply was then settled once\r\nand for all. In less than a week stores sufficient for three months were\r\npoured along the line, and the exhausting labours of the commissariat\r\nofficers ended. Their relief and achievement were merged in the greater\r\ntriumph of the Railway Staff. The director and his subalterns had\r\nlaboured long, and their efforts were crowned with complete success. On\r\nthe day that the first troop train steamed into the fortified camp\r\nat the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara rivers the doom of the\r\nDervishes was sealed. It had now become possible with convenience and\r\nspeed to send into the heart of the Soudan great armies independent of\r\nthe season of the year and of the resources of the country; to supply\r\nthem not only with abundant food and ammunition, but with all the varied\r\nparaphernalia of scientific war; and to support their action on land\r\nby a powerful flotilla of gunboats, which could dominate the river and\r\ncommand the banks, and could at any moment make their way past Khartoum\r\neven to Sennar, Fashoda, or Sobat. Though the battle was not yet fought,\r\nthe victory was won. The Khalifa, his capital, and his army were now\r\nwithin the Sirdar's reach. It remained only to pluck the fruit in the\r\nmost convenient hour, with the least trouble and at the smallest cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: ABU HAMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter carried the account of the war forward at express\r\nspeed. The reader, who had already on the railway reached the Atbara\r\nencampment and was prepared for the final advance on Khartoum, must\r\nallow his mind to revert to a period when the Egyptian forces are\r\ndistributed along the river in garrisons at Dongola, Debba, Korti,\r\nand Merawi; when the reorganisation of the conquered province has been\r\nbegun; and when the Desert Railway is still stretching steadily forward\r\ntowards Abu Hamed.\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Dongola created a panic in Omdurman. Great\r\nnumbers of Arabs, believing that the Khalifa's power was about to\r\ncollapse, fled from the city. All business was at a standstill. For\r\nseveral days there were no executions. Abdullah himself kept his house,\r\nand thus doubtfully concealed his vexation and alarm from his subjects.\r\nOn the fifth day, however, having recovered his own confidence, he\r\nproceeded to the mosque, and after the morning prayer ascended his small\r\nwooden pulpit and addressed the assembled worshippers. After admitting\r\nthe retreat of the Dervishes under Wad Bishara, he enlarged on\r\nthe losses the 'Turks' had sustained and described their miserable\r\ncondition. He deplored the fact that certain of the Jehadia had\r\nsurrendered, and reminded his listeners with a grim satisfaction of the\r\nhorrible tortures which it was the practice of the English and Egyptians\r\nto inflict upon their captives. He bewailed the lack of faith in God\r\nwhich had allowed even the meanest of the Ansar to abandon the Jehad\r\nagainst the infidel, and he condemned the lack of piety which disgraced\r\nthe age. But he proclaimed his confidence in the loyalty of his subjects\r\nand his enjoyment of the favour of God and the counsels of the late\r\nMahdi; and having by his oratory raised the fanatical multitude to a\r\nhigh pitch of excitement, he thus concluded his long harangue: 'It\r\nis true that our chiefs have retired from Dongola. Yet they are not\r\ndefeated. Only they that disobeyed me have perished. I instructed the\r\nfaithful to refrain from fighting and return to Metemma. It was by my\r\ncommand that they have done what they have done. For the angel of the\r\nLord and the spirit of the Mahdi have warned me in a vision that the\r\nsouls of the accursed Egyptians and of the miserable English shall leave\r\ntheir bodies between Dongola and Omdurman, at some spot which their\r\nbones shall whiten. Thus shall the infidels be conquered.' Then, drawing\r\nhis sword, he cried with a loud voice: 'Ed din mansur! The religion is\r\nvictorious! Islam shall triumph!' Whereupon the worshippers, who to the\r\nnumber of 20,000 filled the great quadrangle--although they could not\r\nall hear his voice--saw his sword flashing in the sunlight, and with\r\none accord imitated him, waving their swords and spears, and raising\r\na mighty shout of fury and defiance. When the tumult had subsided, the\r\nKhalifa announced that those who did not wish to remain faithful might\r\ngo where they liked, but that he for his part would remain, knowing that\r\nGod would vindicate the faith. Public confidence was thus restored.\r\n\r\nIn order that the divine favour might be assisted by human effort,\r\nAbdullah adopted every measure or precaution that energy or prudence\r\ncould suggest. At first he seems to have apprehended that the Sirdar's\r\narmy would advance at once upon Omdurman, following the route of the\r\nDesert Column in 1885 from Korti to Metemma. He therefore ordered Osman\r\nAzrak--in spite of his severe wound--to hold Abu Klea Wells with the\r\nsurvivors of his flag. Bishara, who had rallied and reorganised the\r\nremains of the Dongola army, was instructed to occupy Metemma, the\r\nheadquarters of the Jaalin. Messengers were despatched to the most\r\ndistant garrisons to arrange for a general concentration upon Omdurman.\r\nThe Emir Ibrahim Khalil was recalled from the Ghezira, or the land\r\nbetween the Blue and White Niles, and with his force of about 4,000\r\nJehadia and Baggara soon reached the city. Another chief, Ahmed Fedil,\r\nwho was actually on his way to Gedaref, was ordered to return to the\r\ncapital. Thither also Osman Digna repaired from Adarama. But it appears\r\nthat the Khalifa only required the advice of that wily councillor, for\r\nhe did not reduce the number of Dervishes in the small forts along the\r\nline of the Atbara--Ed Darner, Adarama, Asubri, El Fasher--and after a\r\nshort visit and a long consultation Osman Digna returned to his post at\r\nAdarama. Last of all, but not least in importance, Mahmud, who commanded\r\nthe 'Army of the West,' was ordered to leave very reduced garrisons in\r\nKordofan and Darfur, and march with his whole remaining force, which\r\nmay have numbered 10,000 fighting men, to the Nile, and so to Omdurman.\r\nMahmud, who was as daring and ambitious as he was conceited and\r\nincapable, received the summons with delight, and began forthwith to\r\ncollect his troops.\r\n\r\nThe Khalifa saw very clearly that he could not trust the riverain\r\ntribes. The Jaalin and Barabra were discontented. He knew that they\r\nwere weary of his rule and of war. In proportion as the Egyptian\r\narmy advanced, so their loyalty and the taxes they paid decreased.\r\nHe therefore abandoned all idea of making a stand at Berber. The Emir\r\nYunes--who, since he had been transferred from Dongola in 1895, had\r\nruled the district--was directed to collect all the camels, boats,\r\ngrain, and other things that might assist an invading army and send them\r\nto Metemma. The duty was most thoroughly performed. The inhabitants\r\nwere soon relieved of all their property and of most of their means\r\nof livelihood, and their naturally bitter resentment at this merciless\r\ntreatment explains to some extent the astonishing events which followed\r\nthe capture of Abu Hamed. This last place Abdullah never regarded as\r\nmore than an outpost. Its garrison was not large, and although it\r\nhad now become the most northerly Dervish position, only a\r\nslender reinforcement was added to the force under the command of\r\nMohammed-ez-Zein.\r\n\r\nThe power of the gunboats and their effect in the Dongola campaign were\r\nfully appreciated by the Arabs; and the Khalifa, in the hopes of closing\r\nthe Sixth Cataract, began to construct several forts at the northern end\r\nof the Shabluka gorge. The Bordein, one of Gordon's old steamers, plied\r\nbusily between Omdurman and Wad Hamed, transporting guns and stores; and\r\nAhmed Fedil was sent with a sufficient force to hold the works when they\r\nwere made. But the prophecy of the Mahdi exercised a powerful effect on\r\nthe Khalifa's mind, and while he neglected no detail he based his\r\nhopes on the issue of a great battle on the plains of Kerreri, when\r\nthe invaders should come to the walls of the city. With this prospect\r\ncontinually before him he drilled and organised the increasing army at\r\nOmdurman with the utmost regularity, and every day the savage soldiery\r\npractised their evolutions upon the plain they were presently to strew\r\nwith their bodies.\r\n\r\nBut after a while it became apparent that the 'Turks' were not\r\nadvancing. They tarried on the lands they had won. The steamers went no\r\nfurther than Merawi. The iron road stopped at Kerma. Why had they not\r\nfollowed up their success? Obviously because they feared the army that\r\nawaited them at Omdurman. At this the Khalifa took fresh courage, and\r\nin January 1897 he began to revolve schemes for taking the offensive and\r\nexpelling the invaders from the Dongola province. The army drilled and\r\nmanœuvred continually on the plains of Kerreri; great numbers of camels\r\nwere collected at Omdurman; large stores of dried kisru or 'Soudan\r\nbiscuit,' the food of Dervishes on expeditions, were prepared.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar did not remain in ignorance of these preparations. The\r\ntireless enterprise of the Intelligence Branch furnished the most\r\ncomplete information; and preparations were made to concentrate the\r\ntroops in Dongola on any threatened point, should the enemy advance.\r\nRegular reconnaissances were made by the cavalry both into the desert\r\ntowards Gakdul Wells and along the river. Towards the end of May it was\r\nreported that the Emir Yunes had crossed the Nile and was raiding the\r\nvillages on the left bank below Abu Hamed. In consequence the Sirdar\r\nordered a strong patrol under Captain Le Gallais, and consisting of\r\nthree squadrons of cavalry under Captain Mahon, three companies of the\r\nCamel Corps, and 100 men of the IXth Soudanese on camels, with one Maxim\r\ngun, to reconnoitre up the Nile through the Shukuk Pass and as far as\r\nSalamat.\r\n\r\nThe outward journey was unbroken by incident; but as the patrol was\r\nreturning it was attacked by an equal force of Dervishes, and a sharp\r\nlittle skirmish ensued in which one British officer--Captain Peyton--was\r\nseverely wounded, nine Egyptian troopers were killed, and three others\r\nwounded. This proof that the Dervishes were on the move enforced the\r\ngreatest vigilance in all the Dongola garrisons.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, Mahmud with his army arrived at Omdurman. The Khalifa\r\nreceived him with delight, and several imposing reviews were held\r\noutside the city. Mahmud himself was eager to march against the 'Turks.'\r\nHe had no experience of modern rifles, and felt confident that he\r\ncould easily destroy or at least roll back the invading forces. Partly\r\npersuaded by the zeal of his lieutenant, and partly by the wavering and\r\ndoubtful attitude of the Jaalin, the Khalifa determined early in June to\r\nsend the Kordofan army to occupy Metemma, and thereby either to awe the\r\ntribe into loyalty, or force them to revolt while the Egyptian troops\r\nwere still too distant to assist them. He summoned the chief of the\r\nJaalin, Abdalla-Wad-Saad, to Omdurman, and informed him that the Jaalin\r\nterritories were threatened by the Turks. In the goodness of his heart,\r\ntherefore, and because he knew that they loved the Mahdi and practised\r\nthe true religion, he was resolved to protect them from their enemies.\r\nThe chief bowed his head. The Khalifa continued that the trusty Mahmud\r\nwith his army would be sent for that purpose; Abdalla might show his\r\nloyalty in furnishing them with all supplies and accommodation. He\r\nintimated that the interview was over. But the Jaalin chief had the\r\ntemerity to protest. He assured the Khalifa of his loyalty, and of the\r\nability of his tribe to repel the enemy. He implored him not to impose\r\nthe burden of an army upon them. He exaggerated the poverty of Metemma;\r\nhe lamented the misfortunes of the times. Finally he begged forgiveness\r\nfor making his protest.\r\n\r\nThe Khalifa was infuriated. Forgetting his usual self-control and\r\nthe forms of public utterance, he broke out into a long and abusive\r\nharangue. He told the chief that he had long doubted his loyalty, that\r\nhe despised his protestations, that he was worthy of a shameful death,\r\nthat his tribe were a blot upon the face of the earth, and that he hoped\r\nMahmud would improve their manners and those of their wives.\r\n\r\nAbdalla-Wad-Saad crept from the presence, and returned in fury and\r\ndisgust to Metemma. Having collected the head men of his tribe, he\r\ninformed them of his reception and the Khalifa's intent. They did not\r\nneed to be told that the quartering upon them of Mahmud's army meant the\r\nplunder of their goods, the ruin of their homes, and the rape of their\r\nwomen. It was resolved to revolt and join the Egyptian forces. As a\r\nresult of the council the Jaalin chief wrote two letters. The first\r\nwas addressed to the Sirdar, and reached General Rundle at Merawi by\r\nmessenger on the 24th of June. It declared the Jaalin submission to the\r\nGovernment, and begged for help, if possible in men, or, failing that,\r\nin arms; but ended by saying that, help or no help, the tribe were\r\nresolved to fight the Dervishes and hold Metemma to the death. The\r\nsecond letter--a mad and fatal letter--carried defiance to the Khalifa.\r\n\r\nRundle, who was at Merawi when the Jaalin messenger found him, lost\r\nno time. A large amount of ammunition and 1,100 Remington rifles were\r\nspeedily collected and hurried on camels across the desert by the\r\nKorti-Metemma route, escorted by a strong detachment of the Camel Corps.\r\nThe Khalifa did not receive his letter until the 27th of June. But he\r\nacted with even greater promptitude. Part of Mahmud's army had already\r\nstarted for the north. Mahmud and the rest followed on the 28th. On the\r\n30th the advanced guard arrived before Metemma. The Jaalin prepared to\r\nresist desperately. Nearly the whole tribe had responded to the summons\r\nof their chief, and more than 2,500 men were collected behind the walls\r\nof the town. But in all this force there were only eighty serviceable\r\nrifles, and only fifteen rounds of ammunition each. Abdalla expected\r\nthat the Dervishes would make their heaviest attack on the south side\r\nof Metemma, and he therefore disposed his few riflemen along that front.\r\nThe defence of the rest of the town had perforce to be entrusted to the\r\nvalour of the spearmen.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 1st of July, Mahmud, with a force variously\r\nestimated at 10,000 or 12,000 men, began his assault. The first attack\r\nfell, as the chief had anticipated, on the southern face. It was\r\nrepulsed with severe loss by the Jaalin riflemen. A second attack\r\nfollowed immediately. The enemy had meanwhile surrounded the whole town,\r\nand just as the Jaalin ammunition was exhausted a strong force of the\r\nDervishes penetrated the northern face of their defences, which was held\r\nonly by spearmen. The whole of Mahmud's army poured in through the\r\ngap, and the garrison, after a stubborn resistance, were methodically\r\nexterminated. An inhuman butchery of the children and some of the women\r\nfollowed. Abdalla-Wad-Saad was among the killed.\r\n\r\nA few of the Jaalin who had escaped from the general destruction fled\r\ntowards Gakdul. Here they found the Camel Corps with their caravan of\r\nrifles and ammunition. Like another force that had advanced by this\r\nvery road to carry succour to men in desperate distress, the relief had\r\narrived too late. The remnants of the Jaalin were left in occupation of\r\nGakdul Wells. The convoy and its escort returned to Korti.\r\n\r\nBut while the attention of the Khalifa was directed to these matters, a\r\nfar more serious menace offered from another quarter. Unnoticed by the\r\nDervishes, or, if noticed, unappreciated, the railway was stretching\r\nfarther and farther into the desert. By the middle of July it had\r\nreached the 130th mile, and, as is related in the last chapter, work had\r\nto be suspended until Abu Hamed was in the hands of the Egyptian forces.\r\nThe Nile was rising fast. Very soon steamers would be able to pass the\r\nFourth Cataract. It should have been evident that the next movement in\r\nthe advance of the 'Turks' impended. The Khalifa seems, indeed, to\r\nhave understood that the rise of the river increased his peril,\r\nfor throughout July he continued to send orders to the Emir in\r\nBerber--Yunes--that he should advance into the Monassir district, harry\r\nsuch villages as existed, and obstruct the frequent reconnaissances from\r\nMerawi. Yunes, however, preferred to do otherwise, and remained on the\r\nleft bank opposite Berber until, at length, his master recalled him to\r\nOmdurman to explain his conduct. Meanwhile, determined with mathematical\r\nexactness by the rise of the Nile and progress of the railway, the\r\nmoment of the Egyptian advance arrived.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July preparations were made, as secretly as possible, to\r\ndespatch a flying column against Abu Hamed. The Dervish garrison, under\r\nMohammed-ez-Zein, was not believed to exceed 600 men, but in order that\r\nthere should be no doubt as to the result it was determined to employ a\r\nstrong force.\r\n\r\nA brigade of all arms was formed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Commanding: MAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER\r\n\r\n  Cavalry.......   One troop\r\n  Artillery  ......   No. 2 Field Battery\r\n   [This battery consisted of six Krupp guns, two Maxims, one Gardner gun,\r\n     and one Nordenfeldt--an effective medley.]\r\n\r\n  Infantry.......   MACDONALD'S BRIGADE\r\n                                       --3rd Egyptian\r\n                                       --IXth Soudanese\r\n                                       --Xth     \"\r\n                                       --XIth    \"\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir Archibald Hunter, the officer to whom the operation\r\nwas entrusted, was from many points of view the most imposing figure in\r\nthe Egyptian army. He had served through the Nile Expedition of 1884-85,\r\nwith some distinction, in the Khedive's service. Thenceforward his rise\r\nwas rapid, even for an Egyptian officer, and in ten years he passed\r\nthrough all the grades from Captain to Major-General. His promotion was\r\nnot, however, undeserved. Foremost in every action, twice wounded--once\r\nat the head of his brigade--always distinguished for valour and conduct,\r\nHunter won the admiration of his comrades and superiors. During the\r\nRiver War he became, in spite of his hard severity, the darling of the\r\nEgyptian Army. All the personal popularity which great success might\r\nhave brought to the Sirdar focussed itself on his daring, good-humoured\r\nsubordinate, and it was to Hunter that the soldiers looked whenever\r\nthere was fighting to be done. The force now placed under his command\r\nfor the attack upon Abu Hamed amounted to about 3,600 men. Until that\r\nplace was taken all other operations were delayed. The Sirdar awaited\r\nthe issue at Merawi. The railway paused in mid-desert.\r\n\r\nThe troops composing the 'flying column' concentrated at Kassingar, a\r\nsmall village a few miles above Merawi, on the right (or Abu Hamed) bank\r\nof the Nile. General Hunter began his march on the 29th of July. The\r\ntotal distance from Kassingar to Abu Hamed is 146 miles. The greatest\r\nsecrecy had been observed in the preparation of the force, but it was\r\nknown that as soon as the column actually started the news would be\r\ncarried to the enemy. Speed was therefore essential; for if the Dervish\r\ngarrison in Abu Hamed were reinforced from Berber, the flying column\r\nmight not be strong enough to take the village. On the other hand, the\r\ngreat heat and the certainty that the troops would have to fight an\r\naction at the end of the march imposed opposite considerations on\r\nthe commander. To avoid the sun, the greater part of the distance was\r\ncovered at night. Yet the advantage thus gained was to some extent\r\nneutralised by the difficulty of marching over such broken ground in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole length of the course of the Nile there is no more\r\nmiserable wilderness than the Monassir Desert. The stream of the river\r\nis broken and its channel obstructed by a great confusion of boulders,\r\nbetween and among which the water rushes in dangerous cataracts. The\r\nsandy waste approaches the very brim, and only a few palm-trees, or here\r\nand there a squalid mud hamlet, reveal the existence of life. The line\r\nof advance lay along the river; but no road relieved the labour of the\r\nmarch. Sometimes trailing across a broad stretch of white sand, in which\r\nthe soldiers sank to their ankles, and which filled their boots with\r\na rasping grit; sometimes winding over a pass or through a gorge of\r\nsharp-cut rocks, which, even in the moonlight, felt hot with the heat of\r\nthe previous day--always in a long, jerky, and interrupted procession of\r\nmen and camels, often in single file--the column toiled painfully like\r\nthe serpent to whom it was said, 'On thy belly shalt thou go, and dust\r\nshalt thou eat.'\r\n\r\nThe column started at 5.30 in the evening, and by a march of sixteen\r\nand a half miles reached Mushra-el-Obiad at about midnight. Here a\r\nconvenient watering-place, not commanded by the opposite bank, and the\r\nshade of eight or ten thorny bushes afforded the first suitable bivouac.\r\nAt 3.30 P.M. on the 30th the march was continued eight and a half miles\r\nto a spot some little distance beyond Shebabit. The pace was slow, and\r\nthe route stony and difficult. It was after dark when the halting-place\r\nwas reached. Several of the men strayed from the column, wandered in the\r\ngloom, and reached the bivouac exhausted. General Hunter had proposed to\r\npush on the next day to Hosh-el-Geref, but the fatigues of his troops in\r\nthe two night marches had already been severe, and as, after Abu Haraz,\r\nthe track twisted away from the river so that there was no water for\r\nfive miles, he resolved to halt for the day and rest. Hosh-el-Geref was\r\ntherefore not reached until the 1st of August--a day later than had been\r\nexpected; but the rest had proved of such benefit to the troops that the\r\nsubsequent acceleration of progress fully compensated for the delay. The\r\ncolumn moved on again at midnight and halted at daybreak at Salmi. In\r\nthe small hours of the next morning the march was resumed. The road\r\nby the Nile was found too difficult for the Maxim guns, which were on\r\nwheels, and these had to make a detour of twenty-eight miles into the\r\ndesert while the infantry moved ten miles along the river. In order\r\nthat the Maxims should not arrive alone at Dakfilli, General Hunter had\r\nmarched thither with the IXth Soudanese at 11 P.M. on the previous day.\r\nThe rest of the column followed a few hours later. On the 4th, by an\r\neighteen-mile march through deep sand, El Kab was reached. A single\r\nshot was fired from the opposite bank of the river as the cavalry\r\npatrol entered the village; and there was no longer any doubt that the\r\nDervishes knew of the advance of the column. Both the troops and the\r\ntransport were now moving admirably; nevertheless, their sufferings were\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nThe nights were consumed in movement. Without shade the soldiers could\r\nnot sleep by day. All ranks wearied, and the men would frequently,\r\nduring the night marches, sink down upon the ground in profound slumber,\r\nonly to be sternly aroused and hurried on. But the pace of the advance\r\ncontinued to be swift. On the 5th, the force, by a fourteen-mile march,\r\nreached Khula. Here they were joined by Sheikh Abdel-Azim with 150\r\nAbabda camel-men from Murat Wells. Up to this point three Egyptians had\r\ndied and fifty-eight men had been left behind exhausted in depots. A\r\ndouble ration of meat was issued to the whole force. The column moved\r\non during the night, and arrived at Ginnifab at 8 A.M. on the morning\r\nof the 6th. Here startling news of the enemy was received. It was known\r\nthat Mohammed-ez-Zein was determined to fight, and a trustworthy report\r\nwas now received that a large force was coming down from Berber to\r\nsupport the Abu Hamed garrison. In spite of the long marches and the\r\nfatigues of the troops, General Hunter resolved to hurry on. He had\r\nalready made up the day spent at Abu Haraz. He now decided to improve on\r\nthe prescribed itinerary, accelerate his own arrival and anticipate\r\nthat of the Dervish reinforcements. Accordingly the troops marched all\r\nthrough the night of the 6-7th with only a short halt of an hour and a\r\nhalf, so as to attack Abu Hamed at dawn. After covering sixteen miles\r\nof bad ground, the 'flying column' reached Ginnifab, 144 miles from\r\nKassingar and only two from the Dervish post, at 3.30 on the morning\r\nof the 7th of August. A halt of two hours was allowed for the troops to\r\nprepare themselves. Half the 3rd Egyptian Battalion remained as escort\r\nto the transport and reserve ammunition, and then the force moved off in\r\nthe darkness towards the enemy's position.\r\n\r\nThe village of Abu Hamed straggles along the bank of the Nile, and\r\nconsists of a central mass of mud houses, intersected by a network of\r\nwinding lanes and alleys, about 500 yards long by perhaps 100 yards\r\nwide. To the north and south are detached clusters of ruined huts,\r\nand to the south there rises a large, ragged pile of rocks. The ground\r\nslopes gradually up from the river, so that at a distance of 300 yards\r\nthe village is surrounded on three sides by a low plateau. Upon this\r\nplateau stand three stone watch-towers, which were erected by General\r\nGordon. The Dervish garrison were strongly posted in shelter trenches\r\nand loop-holed houses along the eastern face of the village. The towers\r\nwere held by their outposts.\r\n\r\nMaking a wide circuit to their left, and then swinging round to the\r\nright, so as to front facing the river, the brigade silently moved\r\ntowards the enemy's position, and at a quarter past six occupied the\r\nplateau in a crescent-shaped formation; the XIth Soudanese on the right,\r\nopposite the north-east corner of the village; the battery, escorted by\r\nthe remaining half-battalion of the 3rd Egyptians, next; then the IXth\r\nin the centre, and the Xth Soudanese on the left flank. As the troops\r\napproached the watch-towers the Dervish outposts fell back and the force\r\ncontinued to advance until the edge of the plateau was reached. From\r\nhere the whole scene was visible.\r\n\r\nThe day was just breaking, and the mist hung low and white over the\r\nsteel-grey surface of the river. The outlines of the mud houses were\r\nsharply defined on this pale background. The Dervish riflemen crouched\r\nin the shelter trench that ran round the village. Their cavalry, perhaps\r\na hundred strong, were falling in hurriedly on the sandy ground to the\r\nsouth near the ragged rocks. The curve of the hills, crowned with the\r\ndark line of the troops, completed and framed the picture. Within this\r\nsmall amphitheatre one of the minor dramas of war was now to be enacted.\r\n\r\nAt half past six the battery came into action, and after a few shells\r\nhad been fired at the loopholed houses in the left centre of the\r\nposition, a general advance was ordered. In excellent order the three\r\nSoudanese battalions, with General Hunter, Lieut.-Colonel MacDonald, and\r\nthe other British officers on horseback in front of their line, advanced\r\nslowly down the hill, opening a destructive fire on the entrenchment.\r\nThe distance was scarcely three hundred yards; but the crescent\r\nformation of the attack made the lines of advance converge, and before\r\nhalf the distance was covered the Xth were compelled to halt, lest the\r\nXIth Soudanese on the right flank should fire into them. The Dervishes\r\nremained silent until the troops were within a hundred yards, when they\r\ndischarged two tremendous volleys, which were chiefly effective upon the\r\nhalted battalion. Major Sidney, Lieutenant Fitzclarence, and a dozen\r\nmen were shot dead. More than fifty men were wounded. All the Soudanese\r\nthereupon with a loud shout rushed upon the entrenchment, stormed it,\r\nand hunted the Dervishes into the houses. In the street-fighting which\r\nfollowed, the numbers of the troops prevailed. The advance scarcely\r\npaused until the river bank was reached, and by 7.30 Abu Hamed was in\r\nthe possession of the Egyptian forces.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish horsemen, who had remained spectators near the southern crag\r\nduring the attack, fled towards Berber as soon as they saw the attack\r\nsuccessful. Scarcely any of the infantry escaped.\r\n\r\nIn this action, besides the two British officers, Major H. M. Sidney and\r\nLieutenant E. Fitzclarence, 21 native soldiers were killed; 61 native\r\nsoldiers were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe news of the capture of Abu Hamed was carried swiftly by camel and\r\nwire to all whom it might concern. The Sirdar, anticipating the result,\r\nhad already ordered the gunboats to commence the passage of the Fourth\r\nCataract. The camp at Railhead sprang to life after an unaccustomed\r\nrest, and the line began again to grow rapidly. The Dervishes who were\r\nhurrying from Berber were only twenty miles from Abu Hamed when they met\r\nthe fugitives. They immediately turned back, and retired to the foot of\r\nthe Fifth Cataract, whence after a few days' halt they continued their\r\nretreat. Their proximity to the captured village shows how little time\r\nthe column had to spare, and that General Hunter was wise to press\r\nhis marches. The Emir who commanded at Berber heard of the loss of the\r\noutpost on the 9th. He sent the messenger on to Metemma. Mahmud\r\nreplied on the 11th that he was starting at once with his whole army to\r\nreinforce Berber. Apparently, however, he did not dare to move without\r\nthe Khalifa's permission; for his letters, as late as the 20th, show\r\nthat he had not broken his camp, and was still asking the Emir for\r\ninformation as to the doings of the 'Turks.' Of a truth there was plenty\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August the gunboats El Teb and Tamai approached the Fourth\r\nCataract to ascend to the Abu Hamed-Berber reach of the river. Major\r\nDavid was in charge of the operation. Lieutenants Hood and Beatty (Royal\r\nNavy) commanded the vessels. Two hundred men of the 7th Egyptians were\r\ntowed in barges to assist in hauling the steamers in the difficult\r\nplaces. The current was, however, too strong, and it was found necessary\r\nto leave three barges, containing 160 soldiers, at the foot of the\r\nrapids. Nevertheless, as the cataract was not considered a very\r\nformidable barrier, Major David determined to make the attempt. Early on\r\nthe 5th, therefore, the Tamai tried the ascent. About 300 local Shaiggia\r\ntribesmen had been collected, and their efforts were directed--or, as\r\nthe result proved, mis-directed--by those few of the Egyptian soldiers\r\nwho had not been left behind. The steamer, with her engines working at\r\nfull speed, succeeded in mounting half the distance. But the rush of\r\nwater was then so great that her bows were swept round, and, after a\r\nnarrow escape of capsizing, she was carried swiftly down the stream.\r\n\r\nThe officers thought that this failure was due to the accidental fouling\r\nof a rope at a critical moment, and to the fact that there were not\r\nenough local tribesmen pulling at the hawsers. Four hundred more\r\nShaiggia were therefore collected from the neighbouring villages, and in\r\nthe afternoon the Teb attempted the passage. Her fortunes were far\r\nworse than those of the Tamai. Owing to the lack of co-operation and\r\ndiscipline among the local tribesmen, their utter ignorance of what was\r\nrequired of them, and the want of proper supervision, the hauling power\r\nwas again too weak. Again the bows of the steamer were swept round, and,\r\nas the hawsers held, a great rush of water poured over the bulwarks. In\r\nten seconds the Teb heeled over and turned bottom upwards. The hawsers\r\nparted under this new strain, and she was swept down stream with only\r\nher keel showing. Lieutenant Beatty and most of the crew were thrown, or\r\nglad to jump, into the foaming water of the cataract, and, being carried\r\ndown the river, were picked up below the rapids by the Tamai, which was\r\nluckily under steam. Their escape was extraordinary, for of the score\r\nwho were flung into the water only one Egyptian was drowned. Two other\r\nmen were, however, missing, and their fate seemed certain. The capsized\r\nsteamer, swirled along by the current, was jammed about a mile below the\r\ncataract between two rocks, where she became a total wreck. Anxious to\r\nsee if there was any chance of raising her, the officers proceeded in\r\nthe Tamai to the scene. The bottom of the vessel was just visible above\r\nthe surface. It was evident to all that her salvage would be a work\r\nof months. The officers were about to leave the wreck, when suddenly\r\na knocking was heard within the hull. Tools were brought, a plate was\r\nremoved, and there emerged, safe and sound from the hold in which they\r\nhad been thus terribly imprisoned, the second engineer and a stoker.\r\nWhen the rapidity with which the steamer turned upside down, with the\r\nengines working, the fires burning, and the boilers full--the darkness,\r\nwith all the floors become ceilings--the violent inrush of water--the\r\nwild career down the stream--are remembered, it will be conceded that\r\nthe experience of these men was sufficiently remarkable.\r\n\r\nSearch was now made for another passage. This was found on the 6th,\r\nnearer the right bank of the river. On the 8th the Metemma arrived with\r\n300 more men of the 7th Egyptians. Three days were spent in preparations\r\nand to allow the Nile to rise a little more. On the 13th, elaborate\r\nprecautions being observed, the Metemma passed the cataract safely, and\r\nwas tied up to the bank on the higher reach. The Tamai followed the next\r\nday. On the 19th and 20th the new gunboats Fateh, Naser, and Zafir, the\r\nmost powerful vessels on the river, accomplished the passage. Meanwhile\r\nthe Metemma and Tamai had already proceeded up stream. On the 23rd the\r\nunarmed steamer Dal made the ascent, and by the 29th the whole flotilla\r\nreached Abu Hamed safely.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the gunboats events began to move at the double.\r\nThe sudden dart upon Abu Hamed had caused the utmost consternation among\r\nthe Dervishes. Finding that Mahmud was not going to reinforce him,\r\nand fearing the treachery of the local tribes, Zeki Osman, the Emir in\r\nBerber, decided to fall back, and on the 24th he evacuated Berber and\r\nmarched south. On the 27th General Hunter at Abu Hamed heard that\r\nthe Dervish garrison had left the town. The next day he despatched\r\nAbdel-Azim, the chief of Irregulars, and Ahmed Bey Khalifa, his brother,\r\nwith forty Ababda tribesmen, to reconnoitre. These bold fellows pushed\r\non recklessly, and found the inhabitants everywhere terrified or\r\nacquiescent. Spreading extraordinary tales of the strength of the army\r\nwho were following them, they created a panic all along the river, and,\r\nin spite of a sharp fight with a Dervish patrol, reached Berber on the\r\n31st. As there was no armed force in the town, the enterprising allies\r\nrode into the streets and occupied the grain store--the only public\r\nbuilding--in the name of the Government. They then sent word back to Abu\r\nHamed of what they had done, and sat down in the town, thus audaciously\r\ncaptured, to await developments.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing news of the fall of Berber reached General Hunter on\r\nthe 2nd of September. He immediately telegraphed to Merawi. Sir Herbert\r\nKitchener was confronted with a momentous question: should Berber be\r\noccupied or not? It may at first seem that there could be little doubt\r\nabout the matter. The objective of the expedition was Omdurman. The\r\noccupation of Berber by an Egyptian garrison would settle at once the\r\ndifficulties near Suakin. The town was believed to be on the clear\r\nwaterway to the Dervish capital. The moral effect of its capture upon\r\nthe riverain tribes and throughout the Soudan would be enormous. Berber\r\nwas, in fact, the most important strategic point on the whole line\r\nof advance. This great prize and advantage was now to be had for the\r\nasking.\r\n\r\nThe opposite considerations were, however, tremendous. Abu Hamed marked\r\na definite stage in the advance. As long as Merawi and the other posts\r\nin Dongola were strongly held, the line from Abu Hamed to Debba was\r\ncapable of easy defence. Abu Hamed could soon be made impregnable to\r\nDervish attack. The forces in Dongola could be quickly concentrated on\r\nany threatened point. At this moment in the campaign it was possible\r\nto stop and wait with perfect safety. In the meantime the Khalifa would\r\nsteadily weaken and the railway might steadily grow. When the line\r\nreached the angle of the river, it would be time to continue the\r\nsystematic and cautious advance. Until then prudence and reason\r\ncounselled delay. To occupy Berber was to risk much. Mahmud, with a\r\nlarge and victorious army, lay at Metemma. Osman Digna, with 2,000 men,\r\nheld Adarama almost within striking distance. The railway still lagged\r\nin the desert. The Dongola garrisons must be weakened to provide a force\r\nfor Berber. The Dervishes had the advantage of occupying the interior of\r\nthe angle which the Nile forms at Abu Hamed. The troops in Berber\r\nwould have to draw their supplies by a long and slender line of camel\r\ncommunication, winding along all the way from Merawi, and exposed, as a\r\nglance at the map will show, throughout its whole length to attack.\r\nMore than all this: to advance to Berber must inevitably force the\r\ndevelopment of the whole war. The force in the town would certainly have\r\nits communications threatened, would probably have to fight for its\r\nvery existence. The occupation of Berber would involve sooner or later\r\na general action; not a fight like Firket, Hafir, or Abu Hamed, with\r\nthe advantage of numbers on the side of the Egyptian troops, but an even\r\nbattle. For such a struggle British troops were necessary. At this time\r\nit seemed most unlikely that they would be granted. But if Berber was\r\noccupied, the war, until the arrival of British troops, would cease to\r\nbe so largely a matter of calculation, and must pass almost entirely\r\ninto the sphere of chance. The whole situation was premature and\r\nunforeseen. The Sirdar had already won success. To halt was to halt in\r\nsafety; to go on was to go on at hazard. Most of the officers who had\r\nserved long in the Egyptian army understood the question. They waited\r\nthe decision in suspense.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar and the Consul-General unhesitatingly faced the\r\nresponsibility together. On the 3rd of September General Hunter received\r\norders to occupy Berber. He started at once with 350 men of the IXth\r\nSoudanese on board the gunboats Tamai, Zafir, Naser, and Fateh. Shortly\r\nafter daybreak on the 5th the Egyptian flag was hoisted over the town.\r\nHaving disembarked the infantry detachment, the flotilla steamed south\r\nto try to harass the retreating Emir. They succeeded; for on the next\r\nday they caught him, moving along the bank in considerable disorder,\r\nand, opening a heavy fire, soon drove the mixed crowd of fugitives,\r\nhorse and foot, away from the river into the desert. The gunboats then\r\nreturned to Berber, towing a dozen captured grain-boats. Meanwhile the\r\nSirdar had started for the front himself. Riding swiftly with a small\r\nescort across the desert from Merawi, he crossed the Nile at the Baggara\r\nCataract and reached Berber on the 10th of September. Having inspected\r\nthe immediate arrangements for defence, he withdrew to Abu Hamed, and\r\nthere busily prepared to meet the developments which he well knew might\r\nfollow at once, and must follow in the course of a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: BERBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Berber stands at a little distance from the Nile, on the\r\nright bank of a channel which is full only when the river is in flood.\r\nBetween this occasional stream and the regular waterway there runs a\r\nlong strip of rich alluvial soil, covered during the greater part of the\r\nyear with the abundant crops which result from its annual submersion and\r\nthe thick coating of Nile mud which it then receives. The situation of\r\nBerber is fixed by this fertile tract, and the houses stretch for more\r\nthan seven miles along it and the channel by which it is caused. The\r\ntown, as is usual on the Nile, is comparatively narrow, and in all its\r\nlength it is only at one point broader than three-quarters of a mile.\r\nTwo wide streets run longitudinally north and south from end to end, and\r\nfrom these many narrow twisting alleys lead to the desert or the river.\r\nThe Berber of Egyptian days lies in ruins at the southern end of the\r\nmain roads. The new town built by the Dervishes stands at the north.\r\nBoth are foul and unhealthy; and if Old Berber is the more dilapidated,\r\nNew Berber seemed to the British officers who visited it to be in a more\r\nactive state of decay. The architectural style of both was similar.\r\nThe houses were constructed by a simple method. A hole was dug in the\r\nground. The excavated mud formed the walls of the building. The roof\r\nconsisted of palm-leaves and thorn bushes. The hole became a convenient\r\ncesspool. Such was Berber, and this 'emporium of Soudan trade,' as it\r\nhas been called by enthusiasts, contained at the time of its recapture\r\nby the Egyptian forces a miserable population of 5,000 males and 7,000\r\nfemales, as destitute of property as their dwellings were of elegance.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian garrison of Berber at first consisted only of the 350 men\r\nof the IXth Soudanese, and two companies of the Camel Corps, who arrived\r\non the 16th of September, having marched across the desert from Merawi.\r\nBut the proximity of Osman Digna at Adarama made it necessary speedily\r\nto strengthen the force.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of September MacDonald's brigade, with the\r\nexception of half the 3rd Egyptians, was moved south from Abu Hamed, and\r\nby the end of the month the infantry in Berber were swollen to three and\r\na half battalions. This was further increased on the 11th of October by\r\nthe arrival of the XIIIth Soudanese and the remaining half of the 3rd\r\nEgyptians, and thereafter the place was held by five battalions (3rd,\r\nIXth, Xth, XIth, XIIIth), No. 2 Field Battery, and two companies of the\r\nCamel Corps. As all the Dervishes on the right bank of the Nile had fled\r\nto the south of the Atbara, it was found possible to establish a small\r\nadvanced post of Camel Corps and friendly Arabs in the village of\r\nDakhila, at the confluence of the rivers. From this humble beginning the\r\nAtbara fort with its great entrenchment was soon to develop.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the occupation of Berber upon the tribes around Suakin\r\nwas decisive, and the whole country between these towns became at once\r\ntranquil and loyal. Osman Digna's influence was destroyed. The friendly\r\nvillages were no longer raided. The Governor of the town became in\r\nreality, as well as in name, the Governor of the Red Sea Littoral.\r\nThe route from Suakin to Berber was opened; and a Camel Corps\r\npatrol, several small caravans of traders, and a party of war\r\ncorrespondents--who might boast that they were the first Europeans to\r\nmake the journey for thirteen years--passed safely along it.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to look to the enemy. Had the Khalifa allowed the\r\nEmir Mahmud to march north immediately after the destruction of the\r\nDervish outpost in Abu Hamed, the course of the operations would have\r\nbeen very different. Mahmud would certainly have defended Berber with\r\nhis whole army. The advance of the Expeditionary Force must have been\r\ndelayed until the Desert Railway reached the river, and probably for\r\nanother year. But, as the last chapter has described, the sudden seizure\r\nof Abu Hamed, the defection of the riverain tribes, and the appearance\r\nof the gunboats above the Fourth Cataract persuaded Abdullah that the\r\nclimax of the war approached, and that he was about to be attacked in\r\nhis capital. He accordingly devoted himself to his preparations for\r\ndefence, and forbade his lieutenant to advance north of Metemma or\r\nattempt any offensive operations. In consequence Berber fell, and its\r\nfall convinced the Khalifa that his belief was well founded. He worked\r\nwith redoubled energy. An elaborate system of forts armed with artillery\r\nwas constructed outside the great wall of Omdurman along the river-bank.\r\nThe concentration of Arab and black soldiery from Gedaref, Kordofan,\r\nand Darfur continued. Large quantities of grain, of camels and other\r\nsupplies, were requisitioned from the people of the Ghezira (the country\r\nlying between the Blue and White Niles) and stored or stabled in the\r\ncity. The discontent to which this arbitrary taxation gave rise was\r\ncured by a more arbitrary remedy. As many of the doubtful and embittered\r\ntribesmen as could be caught were collected in Omdurman, where they\r\nwere compelled to drill regularly, and found it prudent to protest\r\ntheir loyalty. The strength and tenacity of the ruler were surprisingly\r\ndisplayed. The Khalifa Sherif, who had been suspected of sympathising\r\nwith the Jaalin, was made a prisoner at large. The direst penalties\r\nattended the appearance of sedition. A close cordon around the city, and\r\nespecially towards the north, prevented much information from reaching\r\nthe Egyptian troops; and though small revolts broke out in Kordofan in\r\nconsequence of the withdrawal of Mahmud's army, the Dervish Empire as\r\na whole remained submissive, and the Khalifa was able to muster all its\r\nremaining force to meet the expected onslaught of his enemies.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week in October the Sirdar decided to send the\r\ngunboats--which now plied, though with some difficulty, up and down the\r\nFifth Cataract--to reconnoitre Metemma and discover the actual strength\r\nand position of Mahmud's army. On the 14th the Zafir, Fateh, and Naser\r\nsteamed south from Berber, under Commander Keppel, each carrying,\r\nbesides its ordinary native crew, fifty men of the IXth Soudanese and\r\ntwo British sergeants of Marine Artillery. Shortly after daybreak on the\r\n16th the flotilla approached the enemy's position. So silently had they\r\nmoved that a small Dervish outpost a few miles to the north of Shendi\r\nwas surprised still sleeping, and the negligent guards, aroused by a\r\nsplutter of firing from the Maxim guns, awoke to find three terrible\r\nmachines close upon them. The gunboats pursued their way, and,\r\ndisdaining a few shots which were fired from the ruins of Shendi,\r\narrived, at about seven o'clock, within range of Metemma. The town\r\nitself stood more than a thousand yards from the Nile, but six\r\nsubstantial mud forts, armed with artillery, lined and defended the\r\nriverside. Creeping leisurely forward along the east bank, remote from\r\nthe Dervish works, the flotilla came into action at a range of 4,000\r\nyards. The fire was at first concentrated on the two northern forts, and\r\nthe shells, striking the mud walls in rapid succession or bursting\r\nin the interior, soon enveloped them in dust and smoke. The Dervishes\r\nimmediately replied, but the inferiority of their skill and weapons was\r\nmarked, and, although their projectiles reached the flotilla, very few\r\ntook effect. One shell, however, crashed through the deck of the Zafir,\r\nmortally wounding a Soudanese soldier, and two struck the Fateh. After\r\nthe long-range bombardment had continued for about an hour the gunboats\r\nmoved forward opposite to the enemy's position, and poured a heavy\r\nand continuous fire of shrapnel and double shell into all the forts,\r\ngradually subduing their resistance. The fugitives from the batteries,\r\nand small parties of Baggara horse who galloped about on the open plain\r\nbetween the works and the town, afforded good targets to the Maxims, and\r\nmany were licked up even at extreme ranges.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the gunboats passed the forts than the Dervish fire ceased\r\nentirely, and it was discovered that their embrasures only commanded the\r\nnorthern approach. As the guns could not be pointed to the southward,\r\nthe flotilla need fear nothing from any fort that had been left behind.\r\nThe officers were congratulating themselves on the folly of their foes,\r\nwhen danger threatened from another quarter. The boats had hugged the\r\neastern bank as closely as possible during their duel with the forts.\r\nThey were scarcely a hundred yards from the shore, when suddenly a sharp\r\nfire of musketry was opened from twenty or thirty Dervish rifle-men\r\nconcealed in the mimosa scrub. The bullets pattered all over the decks,\r\nbut while many recorded narrow escapes no one was actually hit, and the\r\nMaxim guns, revolving quickly on their pivots, took a bloody vengeance\r\nfor the surprise. The flotilla then steamed slowly past the town, and,\r\nhaving thoroughly reconnoitred it, turned about and ran down stream,\r\nagain exchanging shells with the Dervish artillery. All firing ceased at\r\nhalf-past two; but six sailing-boats containing grain were captured on\r\nthe return voyage, and with these the gunboats retired in triumph to\r\na small island six miles north of Metemma, where they remained for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt being now known that bombarding the Dervishes was no less enjoyable\r\nthan exciting, it was determined to spend another day with them; and at\r\nfour o'clock the next morning the flotilla again steamed southward, so\r\nas to be in position opposite Metemma before daylight. Fire was opened\r\non both sides with the dawn, and it was at once evident that the\r\nDervishes had not been idle during the night. It appeared that on the\r\nprevious day Mahmud had expected a land attack from the direction of\r\nGakdul, and had placed part of his artillery and nearly all his army in\r\nposition to resist it. But as soon as he was convinced that the gunboats\r\nwere unsupported he moved several of the landward guns into the river\r\nforts, and even built two new works, so that on the 17th the Dervishes\r\nbrought into action eleven guns, firing from eight small round forts.\r\nThe gunboats, however, contented themselves with keeping at a range\r\nat which their superior weapons enabled them to strike without being\r\nstruck, and so, while inflicting heavy loss on their enemies, sustained\r\nno injury themselves. After four hours' methodical and remorseless\r\nbombardment Commander Keppel considered the reconnaissance complete,\r\nand gave the order to retire down stream. The Dervish gunners, elated\r\nin spite of their losses by the spectacle of the retreating vessels,\r\nredoubled their fire, and continued hurling shell after shell in\r\ndefiance down the river until their adversaries were far beyond their\r\nrange. As the gunboats floated northward their officers, looking back\r\ntowards Metemma, saw an even stranger scene than the impotent but\r\nexulting forts. During the morning a few flags and figures had been\r\ndistinguished moving about the low range of sandhills near the town;\r\nand as soon as the retirement of the flotilla began, the whole of the\r\nDervish army, at least 10,000 men, both horse and foot, and formed in\r\nan array more than a mile in length, marched triumphantly into view,\r\nsinging, shouting, and waving their banners amid a great cloud of dust.\r\nIt was their only victory.\r\n\r\nThe loss on the gunboats was limited to the single Soudanese soldier,\r\nwho died of his wounds, and a few trifling damages. The Arab slaughter\r\nis variously estimated, one account rating it at 1,000 men; but half\r\nthat number would probably be no exaggeration. The gunboats fired in\r\nthe two days' bombardment 650 shells and several thousand rounds of\r\nMaxim-gun ammunition. They then returned to Berber, reporting fully on\r\nthe enemy's position and army.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Berber had been strongly occupied by the Egyptian troops,\r\nOsman Digna realised that his position at Adarama was not only useless\r\nbut very dangerous. Mahmud had long been imperiously summoning him to\r\njoin the forces at Metemma; and although he hated the Kordofan general,\r\nand resented his superior authority, the wary and cunning Osman decided\r\nthat in this case it would be convenient to obey and make a virtue of\r\nnecessity. Accordingly about the same time that the gunboats were making\r\ntheir first reconnaissance and bombardment of Metemma, he withdrew with\r\nhis two thousand Hadendoa from Adarama, moved along the left bank of the\r\nAtbara until the tongue of desert between the rivers became sufficiently\r\nnarrow for it to be crossed in a day, and so made his way by easy stages\r\nto Shendi.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sirdar heard of the evacuation of Adarama he immediately\r\ndetermined to assure himself of the fact, to reconnoitre the unmapped\r\ncountry in that region, and to destroy any property that Osman might\r\nhave left behind him. On the 23rd of October, therefore, a flying column\r\nstarted from Berber under the command of General Hunter, and formed as\r\nfollows: XIth Soudanese (Major Jackson), two guns, one company of the\r\nCamel Corps, and Abdel-Azim and 150 irregulars. Lightly equipped, and\r\ncarrying the supplies on a train of 500 camels, the small force moved\r\nrapidly along the Nile and reached the post at the confluence on the\r\n24th, and arrived at Adarama on the 29th, after a journey of eighty-four\r\nmiles. The report that Osman Digna had returned to the Nile proved to be\r\ncorrect. His former headquarters were deserted, and although a patrol of\r\nsixty of the Camel Corps and the Arab irregulars scouted for forty miles\r\nfurther up the river, not a single Dervish was to be seen. Having thus\r\ncollected a great deal of negative information, and delaying only to\r\nburn Adarama to the ground, the column returned to Berber.\r\n\r\nIt was now November. The Nile was falling fast, and an impassable rapid\r\nbegan to appear at Um Tiur, four miles north of the confluence. The\r\nSirdar had a few days in which to make up his mind whether he would keep\r\nhis gunboats on the upper or lower reach. As in the latter case their\r\npatrolling limits would have been restricted, and they would no longer\r\nhave been able to watch the army at Metemma, he determined to leave them\r\non the enemy's side of the obstruction. This involved the formation of a\r\ndepot at Dakhila ['Atbara Fort'], where simple repairs could be executed\r\nand wood and other necessities stored. To guard this little dockyard\r\nhalf the 3rd Egyptian battalion was moved from Berber and posted in a\r\nsmall entrenchment. The other half-battalion followed in a few weeks.\r\nThe post at the confluence was gradually growing into the great camp of\r\na few months later.\r\n\r\nA regular system of gunboat patrolling was established on the upper\r\nreach, and on the 1st of November the Zafir, Naser, and Metemma, under\r\nCommander Keppel, again steamed south to reconnoitre Mahmud's position.\r\nThe next day they were joined by the Fateh, and on the 3rd the three\r\nlarger boats ran the gauntlet of the forts. A brisk artillery duel\r\nensued, but the Dervish aim was, as usual, erratic, and the vessels\r\nreceived no injury. It was observed that the position of the Dervish\r\nforce was unchanged, but that three new forts had been constructed to\r\nthe south of the town. The gunboats continued on their way and proceeded\r\nas far as Wad Habeshi. The Arab cavalry kept pace with them along the\r\nbank, ready to prevent any landing. Having seen all there was to be\r\nseen, the flotilla returned and again passed the batteries at Metemma.\r\nBut this time they were not unscathed, and a shell struck the Fateh,\r\nslightly wounding three men.\r\n\r\nNo other incident enlivened the monotony of November. The Khalifa\r\ncontinued his defensive preparations. Mahmud remained motionless at\r\nMetemma; and although he repeatedly begged to be allowed to advance\r\nagainst the force near Berber he was steadily refused, and had to\r\ncontent himself with sending raiding parties along the left bank of the\r\nNile, and collecting large stores of grain from all the villages within\r\nhis reach. Meanwhile the railway was stretching further and further to\r\nthe south, and the great strain which the sudden occupation of\r\nBerber had thrown upon the transport was to some extent relieved. The\r\ntranquillity which had followed the advance to Berber was as opportune\r\nas it was unexpected. The Sirdar, delighted that no evil consequences\r\nhad followed his daring move, and finding that he was neither attacked\r\nnor harassed in any way, journeyed to Kassala to arrange the details of\r\nits retrocession.\r\n\r\nThe convenient situation of Kassala--almost equally distant from\r\nOmdurman, Berber, Suakin, Massowa, and Rosaires--and the fertility of\r\nthe surrounding region raise it to the dignity of the most important\r\nplace in the Eastern Soudan. The soil is rich; the climate, except in\r\nthe rainy season, not unhealthy. A cool night breeze relieves the heat\r\nof the day, and the presence of abundant water at the depth of a few\r\nfeet below the surface supplies the deficiency of a river. In the year\r\n1883 the population is said to have numbered more than 60,000. The\r\nEgyptians considered the town of sufficient value to require a garrison\r\nof 3,900 soldiers. A cotton mill adequately fitted with machinery and a\r\nfactory chimney gave promise of the future development of manufacture.\r\nA regular revenue attested the existence of trade. But disasters fell\r\nin heavy succession on the Eastern Soudan and blighted the prosperity\r\nof its mud metropolis. In 1885, after a long siege and a stubborn\r\nresistance, Kassala was taken by the Dervishes. The garrison were\r\nmassacred, enslaved, or incorporated in the Mahdi's army. The town was\r\nplundered and the trade destroyed. For nearly ten years an Arab force\r\noccupied the ruins and a camp outside them. Kassala became a frontier\r\npost of the Dervish Empire. Its population perished or fled to the\r\nItalian territory. This situation might have remained unaltered until\r\nafter the battle of Omdurman if the Dervishes had been content with the\r\npossession of Kassala. But in 1893 the Emir in command of the\r\ngarrison, being anxious to distinguish himself, disobeyed the Khalifa's\r\ninstructions to remain on the defensive and attacked the Europeans at\r\nAgordat. The Arab force of about 8,000 men were confronted by 2,300\r\nItalian troops, protected by strong entrenchments, under Colonel\r\nArimondi. After a fierce but hopeless attack the Dervishes were\r\nrepulsed with a loss of 3,000 men, among whom was their rash leader. The\r\nengagement was, however, as disastrous to Italy as to the Khalifa. The\r\nfatal African policy of Signor Crispi received a decided impetus, and in\r\nthe next year, agreeably to their aspirations in Abyssinia, the Italians\r\nunder General Baratieri advanced from Agordat and captured Kassala. The\r\noccupation was provisionally recognised by Egypt without prejudice\r\nto her sovereign rights, and 900 Italian regulars and irregulars\r\nestablished themselves in a well-built fort. The severe defeat at Adowa\r\nin 1896, the disgrace of Baratieri, the destruction of his army, and\r\nthe fall of the Crispi Cabinet rudely dispelled the African ambitions of\r\nItaly. Kassala became an encumbrance. Nor was that all. The Dervishes,\r\nencouraged by the victory of the Abyssinians, invested the fort, and the\r\ngarrison were compelled to fight hard to hold what their countrymen\r\nwere anxious to abandon. In these circumstances the Italian Government\r\noffered, at a convenient opportunity, to retrocede Kassala to Egypt.\r\nThe offer was accepted, and an arrangement made. The advance of the\r\nKhedivial forces into the Dongola province relieved, as has been\r\ndescribed, the pressure of the Dervish attacks. The Arabs occupied\r\nvarious small posts along the Atbara and in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntown, and contented themselves with raiding. The Italians remained\r\nentirely on the defensive, waiting patiently for the moment when the\r\nfort could be handed over to the Egyptian troops.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar had no difficulty in coming to a satisfactory arrangement\r\nwith General Caneva, the Italian commander. The fort was to be occupied\r\nby an Egyptian force, the stores and armament to be purchased at a\r\nvaluation, and a force of Italian Arab irregulars to be transferred to\r\nthe Egyptian service. Sir H. Kitchener then returned to the Nile,\r\nwhere the situation had suddenly become acute. During November Colonel\r\nParsons, the 16th Egyptian Battalion, and a few native gunners marched\r\nfrom Suakin, and on the 20th of December arrived at Kassala. The Italian\r\nirregulars--henceforth to be known as the Arab battalion--were at once\r\ndespatched to the attack of the small Dervish posts at El Fasher and\r\nAsubri, and on the next day these places were surprised and taken with\r\nscarcely any loss. The Italian officers, although a little disgusted at\r\nthe turn of events, treated the Egyptian representatives with the\r\nmost perfect courtesy, and the formal transference of Kassala fort was\r\narranged to take place on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nAn imposing ceremonial was observed, and the scene itself was strange.\r\nThe fort was oblong in plan, with mud ramparts and parapets pierced for\r\nmusketry. Tents and stores filled the enclosure. In the middle stood\r\nthe cotton factory. Its machinery had long since been destroyed, but\r\nthe substantial building formed the central keep of the fort. The tall\r\nchimney had become a convenient look-out post. The lightning-conductor\r\nacted as a flagstaff. The ruins of the old town of Kassala lay brown\r\nand confused on the plain to the southward, and behind all rose the\r\ndark rugged spurs of the Abyssinian mountains. The flags of Egypt and\r\nof Italy were hoisted. The troops of both countries, drawn up in line,\r\nexchanged military compliments. Then the Egyptian guard marched across\r\nthe drawbridge into the fort and relieved the Italian soldiers. The\r\nbrass band of the 16th Battalion played appropriate airs. The Italian\r\nflag was lowered, and with a salute of twenty-one guns the retrocession\r\nof Kassala was complete.\r\n\r\nHere, then, for a year we leave Colonel Parsons and his small force to\r\nswelter in the mud fort, to carry on a partisan warfare with the Dervish\r\nraiders, to look longingly towards Gedaref, and to nurse the hope that\r\nwhen Omdurman has fallen their opportunity will come. The reader, like\r\nthe Sirdar, must return in a hurry to the Upper Nile.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of November the Khalifa had begun to realise that the\r\nTurks did not mean to advance any further till the next flood of the\r\nriver. He perceived that the troops remained near Berber, and that\r\nthe railway was only a little way south of Abu Hamed. The blow still\r\nimpended, but it was delayed. As soon as he had come to this conclusion,\r\nhe no longer turned a deaf ear to Mahmud's solicitations. He knew that\r\nthe falling Nile would restrict the movements of the gunboats. He knew\r\nthat there were only 2,000 men in Berber--a mere handful. He did not\r\nrealise the tremendous power of rapid concentration which the railway\r\nhad given his enemies; and he began to think of offensive operations.\r\nBut Mahmud should not go alone. The whole strength of the Dervish army\r\nshould be exerted to drive back the invaders. All the troops in\r\nOmdurman were ordered north. A great camp was again formed near Kerreri.\r\nThousands of camels were collected, and once more every preparation was\r\nmade for a general advance. At the beginning of December he sent his\r\nown secretary to Mahmud to explain the plan, and to assure him of early\r\nreinforcements and supplies. Lastly, Abdullah preached a new Jehad, and\r\nit is remarkable that, while all former exhortations had been directed\r\nagainst 'the infidel'--i.e., those who did not believe in the Mahdi--his\r\nletters and sermons on this occasion summoned the tribes to destroy not\r\nthe Egyptians but the Christians. The Khalifa had no doubts as to who\r\ninspired the movement which threatened him. There were at this time\r\nscarcely 150 Europeans in the Soudan; but they had made their presence\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar was returning from Kassala when the rumours of an intended\r\nDervish advance began to grow. Every scrap of information was\r\nassiduously collected by the Intelligence Department, but it was not\r\nuntil the 18th of December, just as he reached Wady Halfa, that the\r\nGeneral received apparently certain news that the Khalifa, Mahmud, all\r\nthe Emirs, and the whole army were about to march north. There can be\r\nno doubt that even this tardy movement of the enemy seriously threatened\r\nthe success of the operations. If the Dervishes moved swiftly, it looked\r\nas if a very critical engagement would have to be fought to avoid a\r\ndamaging retreat. Sir H. Kitchener's reply to the Khalifa's open intent\r\nwas to order a general concentration of the available Egyptian army\r\ntowards Berber, to telegraph to Lord Cromer asking for a British\r\nbrigade, and to close the Suakin-Berber route.\r\n\r\nThe gunboat depot at the confluence, with only a half-battalion escort,\r\nwas now in an extremely exposed position. The gunboats could not steam\r\nnorth, for the cataract four miles below the confluence was already\r\nimpassable. Since they must remain on the enemy's side, so must their\r\ndepot; and the depot must be held by a much stronger force. Although the\r\nSirdar felt too weak to maintain himself even on the defensive without\r\nreinforcements, he was now compelled to push still further south. On the\r\n22nd of December Lewis's brigade of four battalions and a battery were\r\nhurried along the Nile to its junction with the Atbara, and began busily\r\nentrenching themselves in a angle formed by the rivers. The Atbara fort\r\nsprang into existence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the concentration was proceeding. All the troops in Dongola,\r\nwith the exception of scanty garrisons in Merawi, Korti, and Debba,\r\nwere massed at Berber. The infantry and guns, dropping down the river\r\nin boats, entrained at Kerma, were carried back to Halfa, then hustled\r\nacross the invaluable Desert Railway, past Abu Hamed, and finally\r\ndeposited at Railhead, which then (January 1) stood at Dakhesh. The\r\nwhole journey by rail from Merawi to Dakhesh occupied four days, whereas\r\nGeneral Hunter with his flying column had taken eight--a fact which\r\nproves that, in certain circumstances which Euclid could not have\r\nforeseen, two sides of a triangle are together shorter than the third\r\nside. The Egyptian cavalry at Merawi received their orders on the 25th\r\nof December, and the British officers hurried from their Christmas\r\ndinners to prepare for their long march across the bend of the Nile to\r\nBerber. Of the eight squadrons, three were pushed on to join Lewis's\r\nforce at the position which will hereinafter be called 'the Atbara\r\nencampment,' or more familiarly 'the Atbara'; three swelled the\r\ngathering forces at Berber; and two remained for the present in the\r\nDongola province, looking anxiously out towards Gakdul Wells and\r\nMetemma.\r\n\r\nThe War Office, who had been nervous about the situation in the\r\nSoudan since the hasty occupation of Berber, and who had a very lively\r\nrecollection of the events of 1884 and 1885, lost no time in the\r\ndespatch of British troops; and the speed with which a force, so\r\nsuddenly called for, was concentrated shows the capacity for energy\r\nwhich may on occasion be developed even by our disjointed military\r\norganisation. The 1st Battalions of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, of\r\nthe Lincoln Regiment, and of the Cameron Highlanders were formed into a\r\nbrigade and moved from Cairo into the Soudan. The 1st Battalion of\r\nthe Seaforth Highlanders was brought from Malta to Egypt, and held\r\nin immediate readiness to reinforce the troops at the front. Other\r\nbattalions were sent to take the places of those moved south, so that\r\nthe Army of Occupation was not diminished.\r\n\r\nThe officer selected for the command of the British brigade was a man of\r\nhigh character and ability. General Gatacre had already led a brigade in\r\nthe Chitral expedition, and, serving under Sir Robert Low and Sir Bindon\r\nBlood had gained so good a reputation that after the storming of the\r\nMalakand Pass and the subsequent action in the plain of Khar it was\r\nthought desirable to transpose his brigade with that of General\r\nKinloch, and send Gatacre forward to Chitral. From the mountains of the\r\nNorth-West Frontier the general was ordered to Bombay, and in a stubborn\r\nstruggle with the bubonic plague, which was then at its height, he\r\nturned his attention from camps of war to camps of segregation. He left\r\nIndia, leaving behind him golden opinions, just before the outbreak of\r\nthe great Frontier rising, and was appointed to a brigade at Aldershot.\r\nThence we now find him hurried to the Soudan--a spare, middle-sized\r\nman, of great physical strength and energy, of marked capacity and\r\nunquestioned courage, but disturbed by a restless irritation, to which\r\neven the most inordinate activity afforded little relief, and which\r\noften left him the exhausted victim of his own vitality.\r\n\r\nBy the end of January a powerful force lay encamped along the river\r\nfrom Abu Hamed to the Atbara. Meanwhile the Dervishes made no forward\r\nmovement. Their army was collected at Kerreri; supplies were plentiful;\r\nall preparations had been made. Yet they tarried. The burning question\r\nof the command had arisen. A dispute that was never settled ensued. When\r\nthe whole army was regularly assembled, the Khalifa announced publicly\r\nthat he would lead the faithful in person; but at the same time he\r\narranged privately that many Emirs and notables should beg him not\r\nto expose his sacred person. After proper solicitation, therefore, he\r\nyielded to their appeals. Then he looked round for a subordinate. The\r\nKhalifa Ali-Wad-Helu presented himself. In the Soudan every advantage\r\nand honour accrues to the possessor of an army, and the rival chief\r\nsaw a chance of regaining his lost power. This consideration was\r\nnot, however, lost upon Abdullah. He accepted the offer with apparent\r\ndelight, but he professed himself unable to spare any rifles for the\r\narmy which Ali-Wad-Helu aspired to lead. 'Alas!' he cried, 'there\r\nare none. But that will make no difference to so famous a warrior.'\r\nAli-Wad-Helu, however, considered that it would make a great deal of\r\ndifference, and declined the command. Osman Sheikh-ed-Din offered to\r\nlead the army, if he might arm the riverain tribes and use them as\r\nauxiliaries to swell his force. This roused the disapproval of Yakub.\r\nSuch a policy, he declared, was fatal. The riverain tribes were\r\ntraitors--dogs--worthy only of being destroyed; and he enlarged upon\r\nthe more refined methods by which his policy might be carried out.\r\nThe squabble continued, until at last the Khalifa, despairing of any\r\nagreement, decided merely to reinforce Mahmud, and accordingly ordered\r\nthe Emir Yunes to march to Metemma with about 5,000 men. But it was then\r\ndiscovered that Mahmud hated Yunes, and would have none of him. At this\r\nthe Khalifa broke up his camp, and the Dervish army marched back for a\r\nsecond time, in vexation and disgust, to the city.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to those who were acquainted with the Dervish movements that\r\nall offensive operations on their part had been definitely abandoned.\r\nEven in the Intelligence Department it was believed that the break-up\r\nof the Kerreri camp was the end of the Khalifa's determination to move\r\nnorth. There would be a hot and uneventful summer, and with the flood\r\nNile the expedition would begin its final advance. The news which was\r\nreceived on the 15th of February came as a great and pleasant surprise.\r\nMahmud was crossing the Nile and proposed to advance on Berber without\r\nreinforcements of any kind. The Sirdar, highly satisfied at this\r\nastounding piece of good fortune, immediately began to mass his\r\nforce nearer the confluence. On the 21st the British at Abu Dis were\r\ninstructed to hold themselves in readiness. The Seaforths began their\r\njourney from Cairo, and the various battalions of the Egyptian army\r\npressed forward towards Berber and Atbara fort. On the 25th, Mahmud\r\nbeing reported as having crossed to the right bank, the general\r\nconcentration was ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: RECONNAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the story of a campaign is made up of many details which\r\ncannot be omitted, since they are essential to the truth as well as the\r\ninterest of the account, it is of paramount importance that the reader\r\nshould preserve throughout a general idea. For otherwise the marches,\r\nforays, and reconnaissance will seem disconnected and purposeless\r\naffairs, and the battle simply a greater operation undertaken in the\r\nsame haphazard fashion. To appreciate the tale it is less necessary to\r\ncontemplate the wild scenes and stirring incidents, than thoroughly\r\nto understand the logical sequence of incidents which all tend to and\r\nultimately culminate in a decisive trial of strength.\r\n\r\nThe hazards which were courted by the daring occupation of Berber\r\nhave been discussed in the last chapter. From October to December the\r\nsituation was threatening. In December it suddenly became critical. Had\r\nthe Emir Mahmud advanced with the Dervishes at Metemma even as late as\r\nthe middle of January, he might possibly have re-captured Berber. If\r\nthe great Omdurman army had taken the field, the possibility would have\r\nbecome a certainty. The young Kordofan general saw his opportunity, and\r\nbegged to be allowed to seize it. But it was not until the Khalifa had\r\nsent his own army back into the city that, being very badly informed\r\nof the numbers and disposition of the Egyptian force, he allowed the\r\nMetemma Dervishes to move.\r\n\r\nMahmud received permission to advance at the end of January. He eagerly\r\nobeyed the longed-for order. But the whole situation was now changed.\r\nThe Egyptian army was concentrated; the British brigade had arrived; the\r\nrailway had reached Geneinetti; the miserable hamlet of Dakhila, at the\r\nconfluence, had grown from a small depot to a fort, and from a fort to\r\nan entrenched camp, against which neither Dervish science nor strength\r\ncould by any possibility prevail. Perhaps Mahmud did not realise the\r\namazing power of movement that the railway had given his foes; perhaps\r\nhe still believed, with the Khalifa, that Berber was held only by 2,000\r\nEgyptians; or else--and this is the most probable--he was reckless of\r\ndanger and strong in his own conceit. At any rate, during the second\r\nweek in February he began to transport himself across the Nile, with\r\nthe plain design of an advance north. With all the procrastination of an\r\nArab he crawled leisurely forward towards the confluence of the rivers.\r\nAt El Aliab some idea of the strength of the Atbara entrenchment seems\r\nto have dawned upon him. He paused undecided. A council was held.\r\nMahmud was for a continued advance and for making a direct attack on the\r\nenemy's position. Osman Digna urged a more prudent course. Many years\r\nof hard fighting against disciplined troops had taught the wily Hadendoa\r\nslaver the power of modern rifles, and much sound tactics besides. He\r\npressed his case with jealous enthusiasm upon the commander he detested\r\nand despised. An insurmountable obstacle confronted them. Yet what\r\ncould not be overcome might be avoided. The hardy Dervishes could endure\r\nprivations which would destroy the soldiers of civilisation. Barren and\r\ninhospitable as was the desert, they might move round the army at the\r\nAtbara fort and so capture Berber after all. Once they were behind the\r\nEgyptians, these accursed ones were lost. The railway--that mysterious\r\nsource of strength--could be cut. The host that drew its life along it\r\nmust fight at a fearful disadvantage or perish miserably. Besides, he\r\nreminded Mahmud--not without reason--that they could count on help in\r\nBerber itself.\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the Emirs, called to the council, decided the Dervish\r\nleader. His confidence in himself was weakened, his hatred of Osman\r\nDigna increased. Nevertheless, following the older man's advice, he\r\nleft Aliab on the 18th of March, and struck north-east into the desert\r\ntowards the village and ford of Hudi on the Atbara river. Thence by\r\na long desert march he might reach the Nile and Berber. But while his\r\ninformation of the Sirdar's force and movements was uncertain, the\r\nBritish General was better served. What Mahmud failed to derive from\r\nspies and 'friendlies,' his adversary obtained by gunboats and cavalry.\r\nAs soon, therefore, as Sir H. Kitchener learned that the Dervishes had\r\nleft the Nile and were making a detour around his left flank, he marched\r\nup the Atbara river to Hudi. This offered Mahmud the alternative of\r\nattacking him in a strong position or of making a still longer detour.\r\nHaving determined upon caution he chose the latter, and, deflecting his\r\nmarch still more to the east, reached the Atbara at Nakheila. But from\r\nthis point the distance to Berber was far too great for him to cover. He\r\ncould not carry enough water in his skins. The wells were few, and held\r\nagainst him. Further advance was impossible. So he waited and entrenched\r\nhimself, sorely troubled, but uncertain what to do. Supplies were\r\nrunning short. His magazines at Shendi had been destroyed as soon as he\r\nhad left the Nile. The Dervishes might exist, but they did not thrive,\r\non the nuts of the dom palms. Soldiers began to desert. Osman Digna,\r\nalthough his advice had been followed, was at open enmity. His army\r\ndwindled.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time his terrible antagonist watched him as a tiger gloats\r\non a helpless and certain prey--silent, merciless, inexorable. Then the\r\nend came suddenly. As soon as the process of attrition was sufficiently\r\nfar advanced to demoralise the Dervish host, without completely\r\ndissolving them, the Sirdar and his army moved. The victim, as if\r\npetrified, was powerless to fly. The tiger crept forward two measured\r\nstrides--from Ras-el-Hudi to Abadar, from Abadar to Umdabia--crouched\r\nfor a moment, and then bounded with irresistible fury upon its prey and\r\ntore it to pieces.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief strategic account of the Atbara campaign; but the tale\r\nmust be told in full.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of January the Khalifa, having learned of the arrival of\r\nBritish troops near Abu Hamed, and baffled by the disputes about the\r\ncommand of his army, ordered Kerreri camp to be broken up, and permitted\r\nhis forces to return within the city, which he continued to fortify. A\r\nfew days later he authorised Mahmud to advance against Berber. What he\r\nhad not dared with 60,000 men he now attempted with 20,000. The course\r\nof action which had for three months offered a good hope of success\r\nhe resolved to pursue only when it led to ruin. He forbade the advance\r\nwhile it was advisable. When it was already become mad and fatal he\r\ncommanded it. And this was a man whose reputation for intelligence and\r\nmilitary skill had been bloodily demonstrated!\r\n\r\nThe gunboats ceaselessly patrolled the river, and exchanged shots with\r\nthe Dervish forts. Throughout January nothing of note had happened. The\r\nreports of spies showed the Khalifa to be at Kerreri or in Omdurman.\r\nAhmed Fedil held the Shabluka Gorge, Osman Digna was at Shendi, and his\r\npresence was proved by the construction of two new forts on that side\r\nof the river. But beyond this the Dervishes had remained passive. On the\r\n12th of February, however, it was noticed that their small outpost at\r\nKhulli had been withdrawn. This event seemed to point to a renewal of\r\nactivity. It was felt that some important movement impended. But it was\r\nnot until the 15th that its nature was apparent, and the gunboats were\r\nable to report definitely that Mahmud was crossing to the east bank of\r\nthe Nile. The flotilla exerted itself to harass the Dervishes and impede\r\nthe transportation; but although several sailing-boats and other river\r\ncraft were captured, Mahmud succeeded in moving his whole army to\r\nShendi by the 28th of February. His own headquarters were established at\r\nHosh-ben-Naga, a little village about five miles further south. A delay\r\nof more than a fortnight followed, during which the gunboats exercised\r\nthe utmost vigilance. The Suakin-Berber road was again closed for\r\ncaravans, and the Sirdar himself proceeded to Berber. On the 11th of\r\nMarch the remnants of the Jaalin tribe, having collected at Gakdul,\r\nre-occupied the now abandoned Metemma, to find its streets and houses\r\nchoked with the decaying bodies of their relations. On the 13th the\r\nEgyptian look-out station, which had been established on Shebaliya\r\nisland, was attacked by the Dervishes, and in the skirmish that ensued\r\nMajor Sitwell was wounded. On the same day the enemy were reported\r\nmoving northwards to Aliab, and it became evident that Mahmud had begun\r\nhis advance.\r\n\r\nHe started from Shendi with a force which has been estimated at 19,000\r\nsouls, but which included many women and children, and may have actually\r\nnumbered 12,000 fighting men, each and all supplied with a month's\r\nrations and about ninety rounds of ammunition. The Sirdar immediately\r\nordered the Anglo-Egyptian army, with the exception of the cavalry and\r\nLewis's Egyptian brigade--which, with three squadrons, held the fort at\r\nthe confluence--to concentrate at Kunur. Broadwood, with the remaining\r\nfive squadrons, marched thither on the 16th; and the whole cavalry\r\nforce, with the Camel Corps in support, on the three subsequent days\r\nreconnoitred twenty miles up the Nile and the Atbara.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the concentration was proceeding apace. The two Soudanese\r\nbrigades, formed into a division under command of Major-General Hunter,\r\nwith the artillery, reached Kunur on the night of the 15th. The British\r\nbrigade--the Lincolns, the Warwicks, and the Camerons--marched thither\r\nfrom Dabeika. The Seaforth Highlanders, who on the 13th were still at\r\nWady Halfa, were swiftly railed across the desert to Geneinetti. Thence\r\nthe first half-battalion were brought to Kunur in steamers. The second\r\nwing--since the need was urgent and the steamers few--were jolted across\r\nthe desert from Railhead on camels, an experience for which neither\r\ntheir training nor their clothes had prepared them. By the 16th the\r\nwhole force was concentrated at Kunur, and on the following day they\r\nwere reviewed by the Sirdar. The first three days at Kunur were days\r\nof eager expectation. Rumour was king. The Dervish army had crossed the\r\nAtbara at Hudi, and was within ten miles of the camp. Mahmud was\r\nalready making a flank march through the desert to Berber. A battle\r\nwas imminent. A collision must take place in a few hours. Officers\r\nwith field-glasses scanned the sandy horizon for the first signs of the\r\nenemy. But the skyline remained unbroken, except by the wheeling dust\r\ndevils, and gradually the excitement abated, and the British brigade\r\nbegan to regret all the useful articles they had scrupulously left\r\nbehind them at Dabeika, when they marched in a hurry and the lightest\r\npossible order to Kunur.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March the gunboats reported that the Dervishes were\r\nleaving the Nile, and Mahmud's flanking movement became apparent.\r\nThe next day the whole force at Kunur marched across the desert angle\r\nbetween the rivers to Hudi. The appearance of the army would have\r\nbeen formidable. The cavalry, the Camel Corps, and the Horse Artillery\r\ncovered the front and right flank; the infantry, with the British on the\r\nright, moved in line of brigade masses; the transport followed. All was,\r\nhowever, shrouded in a fearful dust-storm. The distance, ten miles,\r\nwas accomplished in five hours, and the army reached Hudi in time to\r\nconstruct a strong zeriba before the night. Here they were joined from\r\nAtbara fort by Lewis's brigade of Egyptians--with the exception of\r\nthe 15th Battalion, which was left as garrison--and the troops at the\r\nSirdar's disposal were thus raised to 14,000 men of all arms. This force\r\nwas organised as follows:\r\n\r\n Commander-in-Chief: THE SIRDAR\r\n\r\n  British Brigade: MAJOR-GENERAL GATACRE\r\n\r\n   1st Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment (6 companies)\r\n    \"      \"     Lincolnshire Regiment\r\n    \"      \"     Seaforth Highlanders\r\n    \"      \"     Cameron Highlanders\r\n\r\n  Egyptian Infantry Division: MAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER\r\n\r\n   1st Brigade             2nd Brigade                3rd Brigade\r\n   LIEUT.-COL.

His original intention had been to march to Hudi. But he now\r\nlearned that at Hudi he would have to fight the Sirdar's main force.\r\nNot feeling strong enough to attack them, he determined to march to\r\nNakheila. The mobility of the Arabs was now as conspicuous as their\r\ndilatory nature had formerly been. The whole Dervish army--horse, foot,\r\nand artillery, men, women, children, and animals--actually traversed in\r\na single day the forty miles of waterless desert which lie between Aliab\r\nand Nakheila, at which latter place they arrived on the night of the\r\n20th. The Sirdar's next object was to keep the enemy so far up the\r\nAtbara that they could not possibly strike at Berber or Railhead.\r\nAccordingly, at dawn on the 21st, the whole force was ordered to march\r\nto Ras-el-Hudi, five miles nearer the Dervishes' supposed halting-place.\r\nThe detour which the Arabs would have to make to march round the troops\r\nwas nearly doubled by this movement. The utter impossibility of their\r\nflank march with a stronger enemy on the radius of the circle was now\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Anglo-Egyptian force was screened by seven squadrons\r\nof cavalry and the Horse Artillery, and Colonel Broadwood was further\r\ninstructed to reconnoitre along the river and endeavour to locate the\r\nenemy. The country on either bank of the Atbara is covered with dense\r\nscrub, impassable for civilised troops. From these belts, which average\r\na quarter of a mile in depth, the dom palms rise in great numbers. All\r\nthe bush is leafy, and looks very pretty and green by contrast with the\r\nsombre vegetation of the Nile. Between the trees fly gay parrots and\r\nmany other bright birds. The river itself above Ras-el-Hudi is, during\r\nMarch and April, only a dry bed of white sand about 400 yards broad,\r\nbut dotted with deep and beautifully clear pools, in which peculiarly\r\nbrilliant fish and crocodiles, deprived of their stream, are crowded\r\ntogether. The atmosphere is more damp than by the Nile, and produces,\r\nin the terrible heat of the summer, profuse and exhausting perspiration.\r\nThe natives dislike the water of the Atbara, and declare that it does\r\nnot quench the thirst like that of the great river. It has, indeed, a\r\nslightly bitter taste, which is a strong contrast with the sweet waters\r\nof the Nile. Nevertheless the British soldiers, with characteristic\r\ncontrariness, declared their preference for it. Outside the bush the\r\nground undulated gently, but the surface was either stony and uneven or\r\nelse cracked and fissured by the annual overflow. Both these conditions\r\nmade it hard for cavalry, and still more for artillery, to move freely;\r\nand the difficulties were complicated by frequent holes and small khors\r\nfull of long grass.\r\n\r\nAmid such scenes the squadrons moved cautiously forward. Having made the\r\nground good for fifteen miles from Hudi, Colonel Broadwood halted his\r\nforce at Abadar, an old fort, and sent one squadron under Captain Le\r\nGallais seven miles further. At two o'clock this squadron returned,\r\nhaving met a few of the enemy's scouts, but no formed bodies. While\r\nthe force watered by turns at the river Captain Baring's squadron\r\nwas extended in a line of outposts about a mile and a quarter to the\r\nsouth-east. But the reconnoitring squadron had been followed homeward by\r\nseveral hundred Dervish horsemen. Creeping along through the dense bush\r\nby the bank and evading the vedettes, these suddenly fell on the picket\r\nline and drove in all the outposts. In this affair eight troopers were\r\nkilled and seven wounded. Thirteen horses were also lost, as, having rid\r\nthemselves of their riders on the broken ground, they galloped off after\r\nthe Arab mares on which the Dervishes were mostly mounted.\r\n\r\nThe news of an attack on Adarama was received on this same afternoon. It\r\nappeared that the Arabs had been repulsed by the Abyssinian irregulars\r\nraised by Colonel Parsons. Glowing details were forthcoming, but I do\r\nnot propose to recount the Homeric struggles of the 'friendlies.' Little\r\nin them is worthy of remembrance; much seeks oblivion.\r\n\r\nFor more than a week the Anglo-Egyptian force remained halted at\r\nRas-el-Hudi, waiting for privation to demoralise Mahmud's army or to\r\nexasperate him into making an attack. Every morning the cavalry rode out\r\ntowards the enemy's camp. All day long they skirmished with or watched\r\nthe Baggara horse, and at night they returned wearily to camp. Each\r\nmorning the army awoke full of the hopes of battle, waited during the\r\nlong hours, and finally retired to sleep in deep disgust and profound\r\npeace. And while the army halted, the camp began to assume a more homely\r\nappearance. The zeriba grew stronger and thicker, the glacis wider, the\r\nfield kitchens more elaborate, the pools of the Atbara more dirty.\r\nOver all the sun beat down in merciless persistence, till all white men\r\nquivered with weary suffering when in the open air, and even under the\r\ngrass huts or improvised tents the temperature always registered 115°\r\nduring the hottest hours of the day. The nights were, however, cool and\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nBut although the main part of the force found the days long and tedious,\r\nthe time which the army spent at Ras-el-Hudi was by no means uneventful.\r\nThe work of the squadrons was hard, and ceased only with the night. The\r\ncontinual patrolling told severely on men and horses; and the fact that\r\nthe Dervishes were far stronger in the mounted arm than the Sirdar's\r\narmy necessitated the utmost vigilance of the cavalry commander.\r\nEmployment was also found for the gunboats.\r\n\r\nWhen Mahmud had left the Nile he had established a sort of depot at\r\nShendi, in which the wives of the Emirs and the surplus stores had been\r\ndeposited. This treasure house was protected only by a slender garrison\r\nof 700 riflemen and twenty-five horsemen. On ordinary military grounds,\r\nand also since the event might infuriate the Arabs, it was decided\r\nto capture this place and disperse its defenders. Accordingly, on the\r\nafternoon of the 24th the 3rd Egyptian Battalion from Lewis's brigade\r\nmarched from Ras-el-Hudi to Atbara fort and relieved the 15th Egyptians\r\nthen in garrison, and a small force under Commander Keppel--consisting\r\nof the 15th Egyptians under Major Hickman, two field-guns of Peake's\r\nbattery, and 150 Jaalin irregulars--was embarked on, or in boats towed\r\nby, the three gunboats Zafir, Naser, and Fateh, and started the same\r\nnight for Shendi.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 27th the flotilla appeared off Shendi. The Dervishes had\r\nbeen apprised of its approach and prepared to offer resistance. But the\r\nforce against them was overwhelming. Under cover of the gunboats the\r\ninfantry and guns were landed. The artillery then came into action,\r\nbut after they had discharged two shells, the Arabs fled, firing their\r\nrifles with little effect. Shendi was occupied by the Egyptians. The\r\npursuit was left to the Jaalin, and in it they are said to have killed\r\n160 men--a revenge which must have been doubly sweet since it was\r\nconsummated so near to the scene of the destruction of their tribe, and\r\nwas also attended by scarcely any danger. Loot of all kinds fell to the\r\nvictors, and the gunboats were soon laden with a miscellaneous spoil.\r\nThe wives of the important Emirs made their escape to Omdurman, but\r\nupwards of 650 women and children of inferior rank were taken prisoners\r\nand transported to the Atbara, where in due course they contracted\r\nnew family ties with the Soudanese soldiery and, as far as can be\r\nascertained, lived happily ever afterwards. There were no casualties\r\namong the troops, but the Jaalin lost a few men in their pursuit. The\r\nforce then returned to the Atbara.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd of April was the last day the army spent at Ras-el-Hudi.\r\nThe period of waiting was over. The enemy's position had been duly\r\nreconnoitred. His strength was believed to be sufficiently impaired\r\nfor a successful attack to be made. The camp at Hudi was becoming very\r\ninsanitary. Moreover, the situation, satisfactory though it was, was not\r\none which the commander could view without anxiety. All the time that\r\nthe army was operating on the Atbara it drew its supplies from the fort\r\nat the confluence. Between this and the camp, convoys, protected only\r\nby a handful of Camel Corps, passed once in every four days. Only the\r\nidiotic apathy of the Dervishes allowed the communications to remain\r\nuninterrupted. Mahmud was strong in cavalry. It will be evident to\r\nanyone who looks at the map how easily a force might have moved along\r\nthe left bank to attack the convoys. Such tactics would have occurred\r\nto most savage tribes. But in their last campaigns the Dervishes thought\r\nonly of battles, and disregarded all smaller enterprises. Had they\r\nassailed the communications, the Sirdar might have been forced to build\r\na chain of forts and to guard his convoys with strong infantry escorts.\r\nThe fighting force would have been weakened, the troops have been\r\nwearied, and the result must have been delayed. The Dervishes had as yet\r\nattempted nothing. But there was no reason why they should not at any\r\nmoment become enterprising. It was time to make an end. On the 4th of\r\nApril the whole force moved to Abadar, and established themselves in a\r\nnew camp five miles nearer the enemy. The tiger was tired of watching:\r\nhe had taken his first stride towards his prey.\r\n\r\nAlthough the information as to the enemy's strength and position\r\nwas accurate and complete, the Sirdar decided to order a final\r\nreconnaissance on the 5th of April.\r\n\r\nStarting at four o'clock Broadwood cut off the sharp angle which the\r\nAtbara forms at Umdabia, and, avoiding the thick bush, soon approached\r\nthe Dervish camp. Not a sign of the enemy was seen during the march. The\r\nbush by the Atbara appeared deserted. The camp gave no sign of life;\r\nan ominous silence prevailed. The squadrons moved forward at a walk,\r\nkeeping about 1,200 yards away from the enemy's zeriba and almost\r\nparallel to it. Presently, as they did so, a large force of cavalry\r\nbecame visible in front. It was difficult to estimate their strength,\r\nbut they appeared to be superior in numbers to the reconnaissance. The\r\nDervish horsemen continued to retire towards the south-east, always\r\nreaching round the Egyptian left flank.\r\n\r\nAnd while the Egyptian force advanced, as soon as they were opposite the\r\nsouthern end of the zeriba, another considerable body of Dervish horse\r\nissued from the northern side and threatened the line of retreat. At the\r\nsame time the camp began to swarm with men, and crowds of tiny figures\r\nwere observed clambering on to the entrenchments and gun emplacements,\r\neagerly watching the development of the fight. The cavalry had by\r\nthis time approached to within 1,000 yards of the zeriba, and the Arab\r\nartillery began to fire occasional round shot and clumsily fused shells.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock, the enemy's position having been again sketched and\r\nthe approaches reconnoitred, Colonel Broadwood ordered the retirement to\r\nbegin. The Maxims and artillery were in the centre, supported by Colonel\r\nBroadwood and three squadrons. Captain Baring with three squadrons\r\nwatched the left flank, now in retirement become the right. Captains Le\r\nGallais and Persse guarded the river flank.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry retired by alternate wings in measured fashion. But the\r\nenemy pressed on impetuously, and their horsemen, soon completely\r\nenveloping the desert flank of the Egyptians, began to threaten a\r\ncharge. To meet this Colonel Broadwood sent one of his squadrons from\r\nthe centre to join those under Captain Baring, so that at about a\r\nquarter to ten the reconnoitring force was formed with four squadrons\r\ntowards the desert, two with the guns, and two towards the river. The\r\nweakness of the river flank of the troops encouraged the Dervish horse\r\nlurking in the scrub to make a bold attempt to capture the guns. The\r\nmovement was shrewd and daring, but the cavalry commander met it with\r\nadmirable skill. The springing-up of dust-clouds hardly 300 yards away\r\nwas his only warning. He immediately took command of the two squadrons\r\nunder Persse and Le Gallais, and ordered them to 'right about wheel'\r\nand charge. Thus headed by Broadwood himself, and with their British\r\nofficers several horse-lengths in front, the Egyptians broke into a\r\ngallop and encountered the Baggara line, which numbered not fewer\r\nthan 400 men but was in loose order, with firmness. They struck them\r\nobliquely and perhaps a third of the way down their line, and, breaking\r\nthrough, routed them utterly.\r\n\r\nWhile this dashing operation was carried out on the river flank the\r\nDervish cavalry, following up the retirement, also delivered an attack\r\ntowards the guns. Thereupon Captain Baring with two squadrons galloped\r\nfrom the desert flank across the front of the artillery, and, riding\r\nthrough the advancing enemy, repulsed them with loss. The charge was\r\ngood and effective, but the shock and confusion broke both squadrons,\r\nand, although successful, they came through the Dervishes and back on\r\nto the river flank in some disorder. Persse and Le Gallais, who had just\r\nrallied, at once dismounted their men and opened carbine fire on the\r\nretreating Dervishes. Their action not only checked the enemy, but\r\nprevented, by getting the troopers off their horses, any chance of their\r\nbeing involved in the disorder of the squadrons who had just charged.\r\n\r\nAlthough their horsemen were thus sharply checked, the Dervish infantry\r\ncontinued in spite of losses to advance rapidly, and for a few minutes\r\na hot musketry fire was exchanged by the Arab riflemen and the two\r\ndismounted squadrons. Captain Persse was severely wounded, and several\r\nother casualties occurred. But the whole force was drawing away from\r\nthe enemy, and by eleven o'clock it had passed through the gap to\r\nthe north-east and had shaken off all pursuit. The casualties in the\r\noperation were fortunately small. One British officer was wounded; six\r\nEgyptian troopers were killed and ten wounded; and about thirty horses\r\nwere lost or disabled.\r\n\r\nThe details of the enemy's defences were now known; his strength was\r\nestimated from trustworthy information. It was evident from the frequent\r\ndesertions that his army was disheartened, and from his inactivity that\r\nhe was scarcely hopeful of success. The moment for destroying him had\r\narrived. At daybreak on the morning of the 6th the whole army broke camp\r\nat Abadar and marched to the deserted village of Umdabia, where they\r\nbivouacked close by a convenient pool of the Atbara and seven miles\r\nnearer the Dervish camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: THE BATTLE OF THE ATBARA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1898\r\n\r\nIn the evening of Thursday, the 7th of April, the army at Umdabia\r\nparaded for the attack on Mahmud's zeriba. The camp lay in the scrub\r\nwhich grows by the banks of the Atbara, as by those of the Nile, and\r\nin order to profit by the open, level ground the four infantry brigades\r\nmoved by parallel routes into the desert, and then formed facing\r\nsouth-east in column of brigade squares, the British brigade leading.\r\nThe mounted forces, with four batteries of artillery, waited in camp\r\nuntil two o'clock the next morning, and did not break their march. The\r\ndistance from the river bank to the open plain was perhaps a mile and a\r\nhalf, and the whole infantry force had cleared the scrub by six o'clock.\r\nThe sun was setting, and the red glow, brightening the sandy hillocks,\r\nmade the western horizon indefinite, so that it was hard to tell where\r\nthe desert ended and the sky began. A few gazelle, intercepted on their\r\nway to the water by the unexpected movement of troops, trotted slowly\r\naway in the distance--white spots on the rosy-brown of the sand--and on\r\nthe great plain 12,000 infantry, conscious of their strength and eager\r\nto encounter the enemy, were beautifully arranged in four solid masses.\r\nThen the march began. The actual distance from the camp to the Dervish\r\nposition was scarcely seven miles, but the circle necessary to avoid the\r\nbushes and the gradual bends of the river added perhaps another five to\r\nthe length of the road. The pace of the advance was slow, and the troops\r\nhad not gone far when the sun sank and, with hardly an interval of\r\ntwilight, darkness enveloped everything. In the stillness of the night\r\nthe brigades moved steadily forward, and only the regular scrunching of\r\nthe hard sand betrayed the advance of an overwhelming force upon their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nNo operation of a war is more critical than a night-march. Over and\r\nover again in every country frightful disaster has overtaken the rash or\r\ndaring force that has attempted it. In the gloom the shape and aspect of\r\nthe ground are altered. Places well known by daylight appear strange and\r\nunrecognisable. The smallest obstacle impedes the column, which can only\r\ncrawl sluggishly forward with continual checks and halts. The effect\r\nof the gloom upon the nerves of the soldiers is not less than on the\r\nfeatures of the country. Each man tries to walk quietly, and hence all\r\nare listening for the slightest sound. Every eye seeks to pierce the\r\ndarkness. Every sense in the body is raised to a pitch of expectancy. In\r\nsuch hours doubts and fears come unbidden to the brain, and the marching\r\nmen wonder anxiously whether all will be well with the army, and whether\r\nthey themselves will survive the event. And if suddenly out of the black\r\nsilence there burst the jagged glare of rifles and the crash of a volley\r\nfollowed by the yell of an attacking foe, the steadiest troops may be\r\nthrown into confusion, and a panic, once afoot, stops only with the\r\ndestruction or dispersal of the whole force. Nevertheless, so paramount\r\nis the necessity of attacking at dawn, with all the day to finish the\r\nfight, that in spite of the recorded disasters and the known dangers,\r\nthe night-march is a frequent operation.\r\n\r\nFor more than two hours the force advanced, moving across smooth swells\r\nof sand broken by rocks and with occasional small bushes. Several\r\nshallow khors traversed the road, and these rocky ditches, filled with\r\na strange, sweet-scented grass, delayed the brigades until the pace\r\nwas hardly two miles an hour. The smell of the grass was noticed by\r\nthe alert senses of many, and will for ever refresh in their minds\r\nthe strong impression of the night. The breeze which had sprung up\r\nat sundown gradually freshened and raised clouds of fine sand, which\r\ndeepened the darkness with a whiter mist.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock the army halted in a previously selected space, near the\r\ndeserted village of Mutrus and about two miles from the river. Nearly\r\nhalf the distance to Mahmud's zeriba was accomplished, and barely four\r\nmiles in the direct line divided the combatants; but since it was not\r\ndesirable to arrive before the dawn, the soldiers, still formed in their\r\nsquares, lay down upon the ground. Meat and biscuits were served out to\r\nthe men. The transport animals went by relays to the pools of the\r\nAtbara bed to drink and to replenish the tanks. All water-bottles were\r\nrefilled, pickets being thrown out to cover the business. Then, after\r\nsufficient sentries had been posted, the army slept, still in array.\r\n\r\nDuring the halt the moon had risen, and when at one o'clock the advance\r\nwas resumed, the white beams revealed a wider prospect and, glinting\r\non the fixed bayonets, crowned the squares with a sinister glitter. For\r\nthree hours the army toiled onwards at the same slow and interrupted\r\ncrawl. Strict silence was now enforced, and all smoking was forbidden.\r\nThe cavalry, the Camel Corps, and the five batteries had overtaken the\r\ninfantry, so that the whole attacking force was concentrated. Meanwhile\r\nthe Dervishes slept.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the glare of fires became visible to the south,\r\nand, thus arrived before the Dervish position, the squares, with the\r\nexception of the reserve brigade, were unlocked, and the whole force,\r\nassuming formation of attack, now advanced in one long line through the\r\nscattered bush and scrub, presently to emerge upon a large plateau which\r\noverlooked Mahmud's zeriba from a distance of about 900 yards.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark, and the haze that shrouded the Dervish camp was\r\nbroken only by the glare of the watch-fires. The silence was profound.\r\nIt seemed impossible to believe that more than 25,000 men were ready to\r\njoin battle at scarcely the distance of half a mile. Yet the advance had\r\nnot been unperceived, and the Arabs knew that their terrible antagonists\r\ncrouched on the ridge waiting for the morning; For a while the suspense\r\nwas prolonged. At last, after what seemed to many an interminable\r\nperiod, the uniform blackness of the horizon was broken by the first\r\nglimmer of the dawn. Gradually the light grew stronger until, as a\r\ntheatre curtain is pulled up, the darkness rolled away, the vague\r\noutlines in the haze became definite, and the whole scene was revealed.\r\n\r\nThe British and Egyptian army lay along the low ridge in the form of\r\na great bow--the British brigade on the left, MacDonald in the centre,\r\nMaxwell curving forward on the right. The whole crest of the swell of\r\nground was crowned with a bristle of bayonets and the tiny figures of\r\nthousands of men sitting or lying down and gazing curiously before them.\r\nBehind them, in a solid square, was the transport, guarded by Lewis's\r\nbrigade. The leading squadrons of the cavalry were forming leisurely\r\ntowards the left flank. The four batteries and a rocket detachment,\r\nmoving between the infantry, ranged themselves on two convenient\r\npositions about a hundred yards in front of the line of battalions. All\r\nwas ready. Yet everything was very quiet, and in the stillness of the\r\ndawn it almost seemed that Nature held her breath.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile away, at the foot of the ridge, a long irregular black line\r\nof thorn bushes enclosed the Dervish defences. Behind this zeriba low\r\npalisades and entrenchments bent back to the scrub by the river. Odd\r\nshapeless mounds indicated the positions of the gun-emplacements, and\r\nvarious casemates could be seen in the middle of the enclosure. Without,\r\nthe bushes had been cleared away, and the smooth sand stretched in a\r\ngentle slope to where the army waited. Within were crowds of little\r\nstraw huts and scattered bushes, growing thicker to the southward. From\r\namong this rose the palm-trees, between whose stems the dry bed of the\r\nAtbara was exposed, and a single pool of water gleamed in the early\r\nsunlight. Such was Mahmud's famous zeriba, which for more than a month\r\nhad been the predominant thought in the minds of the troops. It was\r\nscarcely imposing, and at first the soldiers thought it deserted. Only\r\na dozen stray horsemen sat silently on their horses outside the\r\nentrenchment, watching their enemies, and inside a few dirty-white\r\nfigures appeared and disappeared behind the parapets. Yet, insignificant\r\nas the zeriba looked, the smoke of many fires cooking the morning\r\nmeal--never to be eaten--showed that it was occupied by men; and gay\r\nbanners of varied colour and device, flaunting along the entrenchments\r\nor within the enclosure, declared that some at least were prepared to\r\ndie in its defence.\r\n\r\nThe hush of the hour and the suspense of the army were broken by the\r\nbang of a gun. Everyone on the ridge jumped up and looked towards\r\nthe sound. A battery of Krupps a little to the right of the Cameron\r\nHighlanders had opened fire. Another gun further to the right was fired.\r\nAnother shell burst over the straw huts among the palm-trees. The two\r\nMaxim-Nordenfeldt batteries had come into action. The officers looked at\r\ntheir watches. It was a quarter-past six. The bombardment had begun.\r\n\r\nExplosion followed explosion in quick succession until all four\r\nbatteries were busily engaged. The cannonade grew loud and continuous.\r\nThe rocket detachment began to fire, and the strange projectiles hissed\r\nand screamed as they left the troughs and jerked erratically towards the\r\nzeriba. In the air above the enclosure shell after shell flashed into\r\nexistence, smote the ground with its leaden shower, and dispersed--a\r\nmere film--into the haze and smoke which still hung over the Dervish\r\nencampment. At the very first shot all the dirty-white figures\r\ndisappeared, bobbing down into their pits and shelters; but a few\r\nsolitary horsemen remained motionless for a while in the middle of the\r\nenclosure, watching the effect of the fire, as if it had no concern with\r\nthem. The British infantry stood up on tip-toe to look at the\r\nwonderful spectacle of actual war, and at first every shell was eagerly\r\nscrutinised and its probable effect discussed. But the busy gunners\r\nmultiplied the projectiles until so many were alive in the air at once\r\nthat all criticism was prevented. Gradually even the strange sight\r\nbecame monotonous. The officers shut up their glasses. The men began to\r\nsit down again. Many of them actually went to sleep. The rest were soon\r\ntired of the amazing scene, the like of which they had never looked\r\non before, and awaited impatiently further developments and 'some new\r\nthing.'\r\n\r\nAfter the bombardment had lasted about ten minutes a great cloud of dust\r\nsprang up in the zeriba, and hundreds of horsemen were seen scrambling\r\ninto their saddles and galloping through a gap in the rear face out into\r\nthe open sand to the right. To meet the possibility of an attempt to\r\nturn the left flank of the attack, the eight squadrons of cavalry and\r\ntwo Maxim guns jingled and clattered off in the direction of the danger.\r\nThe dust, which the swift passage of so many horsemen raised, shut the\r\nscene from the eyes of the infantry, but continual dust-clouds above\r\nthe scrub to the left and the noise of the Maxims seemed to indicate a\r\ncavalry fight. The Baggara horse, however, declined an unequal combat,\r\nand made no serious attempt to interfere with the attack. Twice they\r\nshowed some sort of front, and the squadrons thought they might find\r\nopportunity to charge; but a few rounds from the Maxims effectually\r\nchecked the enemy, inflicting on each occasion the loss of about twenty\r\nkilled and wounded. With the exception of one squadron detached on the\r\nright, the Egyptian cavalry force, however, remained on the left flank,\r\nand shielded the operations of the assaulting infantry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bombardment--no longer watched with curiosity--continued\r\nwith accuracy and precision. The batteries searched the interior of the\r\nzeriba, threshing out one section after another, and working the whole\r\nground regularly from front to rear. The zeriba and palisades were\r\nknocked about in many places, and at a quarter to seven a cluster of\r\nstraw huts caught fire and began to burn briskly. At a quarter-past\r\nseven the infantry were ordered to form in column for assault.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the attack for the army was simple. The long, deployed line\r\nwere to advance steadily against the entrenchments, subduing by their\r\ncontinual fire that of the enemy. They were then to tear the zeriba to\r\npieces. Covered by their musketry, the dense columns of assault which\r\nhad followed the line were to enter the defences through the gaps,\r\ndeploy to the right, and march through the enclosure, clearing it with\r\nthe bayonet and by fire.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes to eight the Sirdar ordered his bugles to sound the\r\ngeneral advance. The call was repeated by all the brigades, and the\r\nclear notes rang out above the noise of the artillery. The\r\nsuperior officers--with the exception of Hunter, Maxwell, and\r\nMacDonald--dismounted and placed themselves at the head of their\r\ncommands. The whole mass of the infantry, numbering nearly eleven\r\nthousand men, immediately began to move forward upon the zeriba. The\r\nscene as this great force crested the ridge and advanced down the slope\r\nwas magnificent and tremendous. Large solid columns of men, preceded\r\nby a long double line, with the sunlight flashing on their bayonets and\r\ndisplaying their ensigns, marched to the assault in regular and precise\r\narray. The pipes of the Highlanders, the bands of the Soudanese, and\r\nthe drums and fifes of the English regiments added a wild and thrilling\r\naccompaniment. As soon as the advance masked the batteries, the guns\r\nwere run forward with the firing line, in order effectually to support\r\nthe attack. The deployed battalions opened a ceaseless and crushing fire\r\non the entrenchment, and as the necessity of firing delayed the advance\r\nof the attacking columns, the pace did not exceed a slow march.\r\n\r\nThe Dervishes remained silent until the troops were within 300 yards.\r\nThen the smoke-puffs spurted out all along the stockades, and a sharp\r\nfusillade began, gradually and continually growing in intensity until\r\nthe assaulting troops were exposed to a furious and effective fire.\r\nFrom 250 yards up to the position losses began to occur. The whole\r\nentrenchment was rimmed with flame and smoke, amid which the active\r\nfigures of the Dervish riflemen were momentarily visible, and behind\r\nthe filmy curtain solid masses of swordsmen and spearmen appeared. The\r\nfortunate interposition of a small knoll in some degree protected\r\nthe advance of the Lincoln Regiment, but in both Highland battalions\r\nsoldiers began to drop. The whole air was full of a strange chirping\r\nwhistle. The hard pebbly sand was everywhere dashed up into dust-spurts.\r\nNumerous explosive bullets, fired by the Arabs, made queer startling\r\nreports. The roar of the rifles drowned even the noise of the artillery.\r\nAll the deployed battalions began to suffer. But they and the assaulting\r\ncolumns, regardless of the fire, bore down on the zeriba in all the\r\nmajesty of war--an avalanche of men, stern, unflinching, utterly\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards from the entrenchment and one hundred and fifty from\r\nthe thorn bushes independent firing broke out, running along the\r\nline from end to end. Shooting continually, but without any hurry or\r\nconfusion, the British and Soudanese battalions continued their slow,\r\nremorseless advance; and it was evident that, in spite of the fierce\r\nfire of the defence, which was now causing many casualties, the assault\r\nwould be successful.\r\n\r\nThe loss during the passage of the zeriba and in the assault of the\r\nentrenchments was severe. Captain Findlay and Major Urquhart, of the\r\nCameron Highlanders, were both mortally wounded in the fight at the\r\nstockades, and expired still cheering on their men. Major Napier, of\r\nthe same regiment, and Captain Baillie, of the Seaforth Highlanders,\r\nreceived the wounds, of which they subsequently died, a few yards\r\nfurther on. At all points the troops broke into the enclosure.\r\nBehind the stockade there ran a treble trench. The whole interior was\r\nhoneycombed with pits and holes. From these there now sprang thousands\r\nof Dervishes, desperately endeavouring to show a front to the attack.\r\nSecond-Lieutenant Gore, a young officer fresh from Sandburst, was shot\r\ndead between the thorn fence and the stockade. Other officers in the\r\nLincoln and the Warwickshire regiments sustained severe wounds. Many\r\nsoldiers were killed and wounded in the narrow space. These losses were\r\ngeneral throughout the assaulting brigades. In the five minutes which\r\nwere occupied in the passage of the obstruction about four hundred\r\ncasualties occurred. The attack continued.\r\n\r\nThe British brigade had struck the extremity of the north front of\r\nthe zeriba, and thus took the whole of the eastern face in enfilade,\r\nsweeping it with their terrible musketry from end to end, and strewing\r\nthe ground with corpses. Although, owing to the lines of advance having\r\nconverged, there was not room for more than half the force to deploy,\r\nthe brigades pushed on. The conduct of the attack passed to the company\r\ncommanders. All these officers kept their heads, and brought their\r\ncompanies up into the general line as the front gradually widened\r\nand gaps appeared. So the whole force--companies, battalions, even\r\nbrigades--mixed up together and formed in one dense, ragged, but\r\ntriumphant line, marched on unchecked towards the river bed, driving\r\ntheir enemies in hopeless confusion before them. Yet, although the\r\nDervishes were unable to make head against the attack, they disdained to\r\nrun. Many hundreds held their ground, firing their rifles valiantly till\r\nthe end. Others charged with spear and sword. The greater part retired\r\nin skirmishing order, jumping over the numerous pits, walking across the\r\nopen spaces, and repeatedly turning round to shoot. The XIth Soudanese\r\nencountered the most severe resistance after the defences were\r\npenetrated. As their three deployed companies pressed on through the\r\nenclosure, they were confronted by a small inner zeriba stubbornly\r\ndefended by the Emir Mahmud's personal bodyguard. These poured a sudden\r\nvolley into the centre company at close range, and so deadly was the\r\neffect that nearly all the company were shot, falling to the ground\r\nstill in their ranks, so that a British officer passing at a little\r\ndistance was provoked to inquire 'what they were doing lying down.'\r\nNotwithstanding this severe check the regiment, gallantly led by their\r\ncolonel and supported by the Xth Soudanese, rushed this last defence\r\nand slew its last defenders. Mahmud was himself captured. Having duly\r\ninspected his defences and made his dispositions, he had sheltered in a\r\nspecially constructed casemate. Thence he was now ignominiously dragged,\r\nand, on his being recognised, the intervention of a British officer\r\nalone saved him from the fury of the excited Soudanese.\r\n\r\nStill the advance continued, and it seemed to those who took part in\r\nit more like a horrible nightmare than a waking reality. Captains and\r\nsubalterns collected whatever men they could, heedless of corps or\r\nnationality, and strove to control and direct their fire. Jibba-clad\r\nfigures sprang out of the ground, fired or charged, and were destroyed\r\nat every step. And onwards over their bodies--over pits choked with dead\r\nand dying, among heaps of mangled camels and donkeys, among decapitated\r\nor eviscerated trunks, the ghastly results of the shell fire; women and\r\nlittle children killed by the bombardment or praying in wild terror\r\nfor mercy; blacks chained in their trenches, slaughtered in their\r\nchains--always onwards marched the conquerors, with bayonets running\r\nblood; clothes, hands, and faces all besmeared; the foul stench of a\r\nmonth's accumulated filth in their nostrils, and the savage whistle of\r\nrandom bullets in their ears.\r\n\r\nBut at about twenty minutes past eight the whole force, with the\r\nSeaforth Highlanders well forward on the left, arrived at the bank of\r\nthe Atbara, having marched completely through the position, and shot or\r\nbayoneted all in their path. Hundreds of Dervishes were still visible\r\nretiring across the dry bed of the river, and making for the scrub on\r\nthe opposite bank. The leading companies of the Seaforth Highlanders and\r\nLincolns, with such odd parties of Camerons as had been carried on with\r\nthe attack, opened a murderous fire on these fugitives. Since they would\r\nnot run their loss was heavy, and it was a strange sight--the last vivid\r\nimpression of the day--to watch them struggling through the deep sand,\r\nwith the dust knocked up into clouds by the bullets which struck all\r\nround them. Very few escaped, and the bodies of the killed lay thickly\r\ndotting the river-bed with heaps of dirty-white. Then at 8.25 the 'Cease\r\nfire' sounded, and the battle of the Atbara ended.\r\n\r\nForthwith the battalions began to re-form, and in every company the roll\r\nwas called. The losses had been severe. In the assault--a period not\r\nexceeding half an hour--eighteen British, sixteen native officers and\r\n525 men had been killed or wounded, the greater part during the passage\r\nof the zeriba.\r\n\r\nThe actual pursuit was abortive. Colonel Lewis, with his two battalions,\r\nfollowed a line of advance which led south of the zeriba, and just\r\nbefore reaching the river bank found and fired upon a few Dervishes\r\nretreating through the scrub. All the cavalry and the Camel Corps\r\ncrossed the Atbara and plunged into the bush on the further side. But\r\nso dense and tangled was the country that after three miles of peril\r\nand perplexity they abandoned the attempt, and the routed Arabs fled\r\nunmolested. The Baggara horse had ridden off during the action,\r\nheaded by the prudent Osman Digna--whose position in the zeriba\r\nwas conveniently suited to such a manœuvre--and under that careful\r\nleadership suffered little loss. The rest of the army was, however,\r\ndestroyed or dispersed. The fugitives fled up the Atbara river, leaving\r\nmany wounded to die in the scrub, all along their line of retreat. Of\r\nthe powerful force of 12,000 fighting men which Mahmud had gathered at\r\nMetemma, scarcely 4,000 reached Gedaret in safety. These survivors were\r\nadded to the army of Ahmed Fedil, and thus prevented from spreading\r\ntheir evil tidings among the populace at Omdurman. Osman Digna, Wad\r\nBishara, and other important Emirs whose devotion and discretion were\r\nundoubted, alone returned to the capital.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the troops were re-formed, the zeriba was evacuated and the\r\narmy drew up in line along the neighbouring ridge. It was then only nine\r\no'clock, and the air was still cool and fresh. The soldiers lit fires,\r\nmade some tea, and ate their rations of biscuits and meat. Then they\r\nlay down and waited for evening. Gradually, as the hours passed, the\r\nsun became powerful. There was no shade, and only a few thin, leafless\r\nbushes rose from the sand. The hours of a day, peculiarly hot, even for\r\nthe country and season, dragged wearily away. The sandy ridge beat back\r\nthe rays till the air above was like the breath of a furnace and the\r\npebbly ground burned. The water in the fantasses and bottles was hot\r\nand scarce. The pool of the Atbara was foul and tainted. In spite of\r\nthe devoted efforts of the few medical officers who had been allowed\r\nto accompany the force, the wounded officers and soldiers endured the\r\ngreatest miseries, and it is certain that several died of their wounds\r\nwho might in happier circumstances have been saved.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred prisoners were taken. They were mostly negroes--for the\r\nArabs refused to surrender, and fought to the last or tried to escape.\r\nThe captive blacks, who fight with equal willingness on either side,\r\nwere content to be enlisted in the Soudanese regiments; so that many\r\nof those who served the Khalifa on the Atbara helped to destroy him at\r\nOmdurman. The most notable prisoner was the Emir Mahmud--a tall, strong\r\nArab, about thirty years old. Immediately after his capture he was\r\ndragged before the Sirdar. 'Why,' inquired the General, 'have you come\r\ninto my country to burn and kill?' 'I have to obey my orders, and so\r\nhave you,' retorted the captive sullenly, yet not without a certain\r\ndignity. To other questions he returned curt or evasive answers, and\r\nvolunteered the opinion that all this slaughter would be avenged at\r\nOmdurman. He was removed in custody--a fine specimen of proud brutality,\r\nworthy perhaps of some better fate than to linger indefinitely in the\r\ngaol at Rosetta.\r\n\r\nWith the cool of the evening the army left its bed of torment on the\r\nridge and returned to Umdabia. The homeward march was a severe trial;\r\nthe troops were exhausted; the ground was broken; the guides, less\r\ncareful or less fortunate than on the previous night, lost their way.\r\nThe columns were encumbered with wounded, most of whom were already in\r\na high state of fever, and whose sufferings were painful to witness. It\r\nwas not until after midnight that the camp was reached. The infantry had\r\nbeen continuously under arms--marching, fighting, or sweltering in the\r\nsun--for thirty hours, and most of them had hardly closed their eyes\r\nfor two days. Officers and soldiers--British, Soudanese, and\r\nEgyptian--struggled into their bivouacs, and fell asleep, very weary but\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nBritish and Egyptian casualties on the Atbara included 20 officers and\r\n539 men killed or wounded. The Dervish loss was officially estimated at\r\n40 Emirs and 3,000 dervishes killed. No statistics as to their wounded\r\nare forthcoming.\r\n\r\n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nAs the battle of the Atbara had been decisive, the whole Expeditionary\r\nForce went into summer quarters. The Egyptian army was distributed\r\ninto three principal garrisons--four battalions at Atbara camp, six\r\nbattalions and the cavalry at Berber, three battalions at Abadia.\r\nThe artillery and transport were proportionately divided. The British\r\nbrigade encamped with two battalions at Darmali and two at the village\r\nof Selim, about a mile and a half distant.\r\n\r\nFor the final phase of the campaign three new gunboats had been ordered\r\nfrom England. These were now sent in sections over the Desert Railway.\r\nSpecial arrangements were made to admit of the clumsy loads passing\r\ntrains on the ordinary sidings. As usual, the contrivances of the\r\nrailway subalterns were attended with success. Sir H. Kitchener himself\r\nproceeded to Abadia to accelerate by his personal activity and ingenuity\r\nthe construction of the vessels on which so much depended. Here during\r\nthe heat of the summer he remained, nursing his gunboats, maturing\r\nhis plans, and waiting only for the rise of the river to complete the\r\ndownfall of his foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: THE GRAND ADVANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the early months of the summer the preparations for the\r\nfinal advance were steadily proceeding. A second British brigade\r\nwas ordered to the Soudan. A new battery of Howitzer artillery--the\r\n37th--firing enormous shells charged with lyddite, was despatched from\r\nEngland. Two large 40-pounder guns were sent from Cairo. Another British\r\nMaxim battery of four guns was formed in Cairo from men of the Royal\r\nIrish Fusiliers. Three new screw gunboats of the largest size and most\r\nformidable pattern had been passed over the indefatigable railway in\r\nsections, and were now launched on the clear waterway south of the\r\nAtbara encampment; and last, but not least, the 21st Lancers [The author\r\nled a troop in this regiment during the final advance to Omdurman; and\r\nit is from this standpoint that the ensuing chapters are to some extent\r\nconceived] were ordered up the Nile. Events now began to move rapidly.\r\nWithin three weeks of the arrival of the reinforcements the climax of\r\nthe war was over; within five weeks the British troops were returning\r\nhome. There was no delay at the Atbara encampment. Even before the whole\r\nof the second brigade had arrived, some of its battalions were being\r\ndespatched to Wad Hamed, the new point of concentration. This place was\r\na few miles north of Shabluka, and only fifty-eight miles from Omdurman.\r\nIt was evident, therefore, that the decisive moment of the three years'\r\nwar approached. The Staff, the British infantry, one squadron, the guns,\r\nand the stores were carried south in steamers and barges. The Egyptian\r\ndivision marched to Wad Hamed by brigades. The horses of the batteries,\r\nthe transport animals of the British division (about 1,400 in number),\r\nthe chargers of the officers, some cattle, and most of the war\r\ncorrespondents were sent along the left bank of the river escorted by\r\ntwo squadrons of the 21st Lancers and two Maxim guns.\r\n\r\nAll the thirteen squadrons of cavalry remained three days at Wad Hamed.\r\nAfter the fatigues of the march we were glad to have an opportunity of\r\nlooking about, of visiting regiments known in other circumstances, and\r\nof writing a few letters. This last was the most important, for it\r\nwas now known that after leaving Wad Hamed there would be no post or\r\ncommunication with Cairo and Europe until the action had been fought and\r\nall was over. The halt was welcome for another reason. The camp itself\r\nwas well worth looking at. It lay lengthways along the river-bank, and\r\nwas nearly two miles from end to end. The Nile secured it from attack\r\ntowards the east. On the western and southern sides were strong lines of\r\nthorn bushes, staked down and forming a zeriba; and the north face was\r\nprotected by a deep artificial watercourse which allowed the waters of\r\nthe river to make a considerable inundation. From the bank of this work\r\nthe whole camp could be seen. Far away to the southward the white tents\r\nof the British division; a little nearer rows and rows of grass huts and\r\nblanket shelters, the bivouacs of the Egyptian and Soudanese brigades;\r\nthe Sirdar's large white tent, with the red flag of Egypt flying from\r\na high staff, on a small eminence; and to the right the grove of\r\npalm-trees in which the officers of the Egyptian cavalry had established\r\nthemselves. The whole riverside was filled by a forest of masts. Crowds\r\nof gyassas, barges, and steamers were moored closely together; and while\r\nlooking at the furled sails, the tangled riggings, and the tall funnels\r\nit was easy for the spectator to imagine that this was the docks of some\r\npopulous city in a well-developed and civilised land.\r\n\r\nBut the significance of the picture grew when the mind, outstripping the\r\neye, passed beyond the long, low heights of the gorge and cataract\r\nof Shabluka and contemplated the ruins of Khartoum and the city of\r\nOmdurman. There were known to be at least 50,000 fighting men collected\r\nin their last stronghold. We might imagine the scene of excitement,\r\nrumour, and resolve in the threatened capital. The Khalifa declares that\r\nhe will destroy the impudent invaders. The Mahdi has appeared to him in\r\na dream. Countless angelic warriors will charge with those of Islam.\r\nThe 'enemies of God' will perish and their bones will whiten the broad\r\nplain. Loud is the boasting, and many are the oaths which are taken, as\r\nto what treatment the infidel dogs shall have when they are come to the\r\ncity walls. The streets swarm with men and resound with their voices.\r\nEverywhere is preparation and defiance. And yet over all hangs the dark\r\nshadow of fear. Nearer and nearer comes this great serpent of an army,\r\nmoving so slowly and with such terrible deliberation, but always moving.\r\nA week ago it was sixty miles away, now it is but fifty. Next week only\r\ntwenty miles will intervene, and then the creep of the serpent will\r\ncease, and, without argument or parley, one way or the other the end\r\nwill come.\r\n\r\nThe road to the next camp was a long one; for though Royan island,\r\nopposite to which the site had been selected, was only seven miles in\r\nthe direct line, it was necessary to march eight miles into the desert\r\nto avoid the Shabluka heights, and then to turn back to the Nile.\r\nThe infantry were therefore provided with camel transport to carry\r\nsufficient water in small iron tanks for one night; and they were\r\nthus able to bivouac half-way, and to complete the journey on the next\r\nmorning, thus making a two days' march. The mounted troops, who remained\r\nat Wad Hamed till all had gone south, were ordered to move on the 27th\r\nof August, and by a double march catch up the rest of the army.\r\n\r\nWad Hamed then ceased for the time being to exist except in name. All\r\nthe stores and transport were moved by land or water to the south\r\nof Shabluka, and an advanced base was formed upon Royan island.\r\nCommunications with the Atbara encampment and with Cairo were dropped,\r\nand the army carried with them in their boats sufficient supplies to\r\nlast until after the capture of Omdurman, when the British division\r\nwould be immediately sent back. It was calculated that the scope of this\r\noperation would not be greater than three weeks, and on the 27th the\r\narmy were equipped with twenty-one days' supplies, of which two were\r\ncarried by the troops, five by the regimental barges, and fourteen in\r\nthe army transport sailing-vessels. All surplus stores were deposited at\r\nRoyan island, where a field hospital was also formed.\r\n\r\nThe Expeditionary Force which was thus concentrated, equipped, and\r\nsupplied for the culminating moment of the River War, was organised as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n Commander-in-Chief: THE SIRDAR\r\n\r\n The British Division: MAJOR-GENERAL GATACRE Commanding\r\n\r\n  1st Brigade                         2nd Brigade\r\n  BRIGADIER-GEN.

Eager for\r\nplunder, anxious to be on the winning side, Sheikhs and Emirs from every\r\ntribe in the Military Soudan had hurried, with what following the years\r\nof war had left them, to Wad Hamed. On the 26th of August the force of\r\nirregulars numbered about 2,500 men, principally Jaalin survivors, but\r\nalso comprising bands and individuals of Bisharin; of Hadendoa from\r\nSuakin; of Shukria, the camel-breeders; of Batahin, who had suffered\r\na bloody diminution at the Khalifa's hands; of Shaiggia, Gordon's\r\nvexatious allies; and lastly some Gellilab Arabs under a reputed son of\r\nZubehr Pasha. The command of the whole motley force was given to Major\r\nStuart-Wortley, Lieutenant Wood accompanying him as Staff Officer; and\r\nthe position of these officers among the cowed and untrustworthy Arabs\r\nwas one of considerable peril.\r\n\r\nWhile the infantry divisions were marching round the heights of Shabluka\r\nto the camp opposite Royan island, the steamers and gunboats ascended\r\nthe stream and passed through the gorge, dragging up with them the whole\r\nfleet of barges and gyassas. The northern end of the narrow passage had\r\nbeen guarded by the five Dervish forts, which now stood deserted\r\nand dismantled. They were well built, and formed nearly a straight\r\nline--four on one bank and one on the other. Each fort had three\r\nembrasures, and might, when occupied, have been a formidable defence to\r\nthe cataract.\r\n\r\nThreshing up against the current, the gunboats and stern-wheelers one\r\nafter another entered the gorge. The Nile, which below is nearly a mile\r\nacross, narrows to a bare 200 yards. The pace of the stream becomes more\r\nswift. Great swirls and eddies disturb its surface. High on either\r\nside rise black, broken, and precipitous cliffs, looking like piles of\r\ngigantic stones. Through and among them the flood-river pours with a\r\nloud roaring, breaking into foam and rapids wherever the submerged rocks\r\nare near the surface. Between the barren heights and the water is a\r\nstrip of green bushes and grass. The bright verdant colour seems the\r\nmore brilliant by contrast with the muddy water and the sombre rocks.\r\nIt is a forbidding passage. A few hundred riflemen scattered Afridiwise\r\namong the tops of the hills, a few field-guns in the mud forts by the\r\nbank, and the door would be shut.\r\n\r\nThe mounted forces marched from Wad Hamed at dawn on the 27th and,\r\nstriking out into the desert, skirted the rocky hills. Besides the 21st\r\nLancers and nine squadrons of Egyptian cavalry, the column included the\r\nCamel Corps, 800 strong, and a battery of Horse Artillery; and it was\r\na fine sight to see all these horsemen and camel-men trotting swiftly\r\nacross the sand by squadrons and companies, with a great cloud of dust\r\nrising from each and drifting away to the northward.\r\n\r\nThe zeriba of the camp at Royan had been already made and much of the\r\nground cleared by the energy of the Soudanese division, which had been\r\nthe first to arrive. An advanced depot was established at Royan island\r\nwhich was covered with white hospital tents, near which there was a\r\nforest of masts and sails. The barges and boats containing the stores\r\nand kits awaited the troops, and they had only to bivouac along the\r\nriver-bank and shelter themselves as quickly as possible from the fierce\r\nheat of the sun. The dark hills of Shabluka, among and beneath which\r\nthe camp and army nestled, lay behind us now. To the south the country\r\nappeared a level plain covered with bush and only broken by occasional\r\npeaks of rock. The eternal Nile flowed swiftly by the tents and\r\nshelters, and disappeared mysteriously in the gloom of the gorge; and on\r\nthe further bank there rose a great mountain--Jebel Royan--from the top\r\nof which it was said that men might see Khartoum.\r\n\r\nThe whole army broke camp at Royan on the 28th of August at four o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, and marched to Wady el Abid six miles further south.\r\nWe now moved on a broad front, which could immediately be converted into\r\na fighting formation. This was the first time that it had been possible\r\nto see the whole force--infantry, cavalry, and guns--on the march at\r\nonce. In the clear air the amazing detail of the picture was striking.\r\nThere were six brigades of infantry, composed of twenty-four battalions;\r\nyet every battalion showed that it was made up of tiny figures, all\r\nperfectly defined on the plain. A Soudanese brigade had been sent on to\r\nhold the ground with pickets until the troops had constructed a zeriba.\r\nBut a single Dervish horseman managed to evade these and, just as\r\nthe light faded, rode up to the Warwickshire Regiment and flung his\r\nbroad-bladed spear in token of defiance. So great was the astonishment\r\nwhich this unexpected apparition created that the bold man actually made\r\ngood his escape uninjured.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th the forces remained halted opposite Um Teref, and only the\r\nEgyptian cavalry went out to reconnoitre. They searched the country for\r\neight or nine miles, and Colonel Broadwood returned in the afternoon,\r\nhaving found a convenient camping-ground, but nothing else. During the\r\nday the news of two river disasters arrived--the first to ourselves, the\r\nsecond to our foes. On the 28th the gunboat Zafir was steaming from\r\nthe Atbara to Wad Hamed, intending thereafter to ascend the Shabluka\r\nCataract. Suddenly--overtaken now, as on the eve of the advance on\r\nDongola, by misfortune--she sprang a leak, and, in spite of every effort\r\nto run her ashore, foundered by the head in deep water near Metemma.\r\nThe officers on board--among whom was Keppel, the commander of the whole\r\nflotilla--had scarcely time to leap from the wreck, and with difficulty\r\nmade their way to the shore, where they were afterwards found very cold\r\nand hungry. The Sirdar received the news at Royan. His calculations\r\nwere disturbed by the loss of a powerful vessel; but he had allowed\r\nfor accidents, and in consequence accepted the misfortune very\r\nphlegmatically. The days of struggling warfare were over, and the\r\nGeneral knew that he had a safe margin of strength.\r\n\r\nThe other catastrophe afflicted the Khalifa, and its tale was brought to\r\nthe advancing army by the Intelligence spies, who to the last--even when\r\nthe forces were closing--tried to pass between them. Not content with\r\nbuilding batteries along the banks, Abdullah, fearing the gunboats, had\r\nresolved to mine the river. An old officer of the old Egyptian army,\r\nlong a prisoner in Omdurman, was brought from his chains and ordered to\r\nconstruct mines. Two iron boilers were filled with gunpowder, and it\r\nwas arranged that these should be sunk in the Nile at convenient spots.\r\nBuried in the powder of each was a loaded pistol with a string attached\r\nto the trigger. On pulling the string the pistol, and consequently the\r\nmine, would be exploded. So the Khalifa argued; nor was he wrong. It\r\nwas resolved to lay one mine first. On the 17th of August the Dervish\r\nsteamer Ismailia moved out into the middle of the Nile, carrying one of\r\nthe boilers fully charged and equipped with pistol detonator. Arrived\r\nat the selected spot, the great cylinder of powder was dropped over\r\nthe side. Its efficiency as a destructive engine was immediately\r\ndemonstrated, for, on the string being pulled by accident, the pistol\r\ndischarged itself, the powder exploded, and the Ismailia and all on\r\nboard were blown to pieces.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the loss of life, and encouraged by the manifest power of\r\nthe contrivance, the Khalifa immediately ordered the second of the two\r\nboilers to be sunk in the stream. As the old Egyptian officer had been\r\nkilled by the explosion, the Emir in charge of the arsenal was entrusted\r\nwith the perilous business. He rose, however, to the occasion, and,\r\nhaving first taken the precaution of letting the water into the boiler\r\nso as to damp the powder, he succeeded in laying the second mine in\r\nmid-stream, to the joy and delight of Abdullah, who, not understanding\r\nthat it was now useless, overwhelmed him with praise and presents.\r\n\r\nBeguiled with such stories and diversions, the day of rest at Wady el\r\nAbid passed swiftly. Night brought beetles, bugs, and ants, and several\r\nmen were stung by scorpions--a most painful though not dangerous affair.\r\nTowards morning it began to rain, and everyone was drenched and chilled\r\nwhen the sun rose across the river from behind a great conical hill and\r\ndispersed the clouds into wisps of creamy flame. Then we mounted and set\r\nout. This day the army moved prepared for immediate action, and all\r\nthe cavalry were thrown out ten miles in front in a great screen which\r\nreached from the gunboats on the river to the Camel Corps far out in the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nWhen we had advanced a little further, there arose above the scrub the\r\ndark outlines of a rocky peak, the hill of Merreh. The whole of the 21st\r\nLancers now concentrated, and, trotting quickly forward, occupied this\r\nposition, whence a considerable tract of country was visible. We were\r\nhardly twenty-five miles from Khartoum, and of that distance at least\r\nten miles were displayed. Yet there were no enemy. Had they all fled?\r\nWould there be no opposition? Should we find Omdurman deserted or\r\nsubmissive? These were questions which occurred to everyone, and many\r\nanswered them affirmatively. Colonel Martin had meanwhile heliographed\r\nback to the Sirdar that all the ground was up to this point clear, and\r\nthat there were no Dervishes to be seen. After some delay orders were\r\nsignalled back for one squadron to remain till sunset in observation on\r\nthe hill and for the rest to return to camp.\r\n\r\nWith two troops thrown out a mile in front we waited watching on the\r\nhill. Time passed slowly, for the sun was hot. Suddenly it became\r\nevident that one of the advanced troops was signalling energetically.\r\nThe message was spelt out. The officer with the troop perceived\r\nDervishes in his front. We looked through our glasses. It was true.\r\nThere, on a white patch of sand among the bushes of the plain, were a\r\nlot of little brown spots, moving slowly across the front of the cavalry\r\noutposts towards an Egyptian squadron, which was watching far out to the\r\nwestward. There may have been seventy horsemen altogether. We could\r\nnot take our eyes off those distant specks we had travelled so far, if\r\npossible, to destroy. Presently the Dervish patrol approached our right\r\ntroop, and apparently came nearer than they imagined, for the officer\r\nwho commanded--Lieutenant Conolly--opened fire on them with carbines,\r\nand we saw them turn and ride back, but without hurrying.\r\n\r\nThe camp to which we returned was a very different place from the one we\r\nhad left in the morning. Instead of lying along the river-bank, it was\r\npitched in the thinner scrub. The bushes had on all sides been cut down,\r\nthe ground cleared, and an immense oblong zeriba was built, around\r\nwhich the six brigades were drawn up, and into which cavalry, guns, and\r\ntransport were closely packed.\r\n\r\nVery early next morning the advance was continued. The army paraded by\r\nstarlight, and with the first streak of the dawn the cavalry were again\r\nflung far out in advance. Secure behind the screen of horsemen and Camel\r\nCorps, the infantry advanced in regular array. Up to the 27th of August\r\nthe force marched by divisions; but on and after the 30th of August\r\nthe whole force commenced to march in fighting formation. The British\r\ndivision was on the left, the Egyptian army on the right. All the\r\nbrigades marched in line, or in a slight echelon. The flank brigades\r\nkept their flank battalions in column or in fours. Other British\r\nbattalions had six companies in the front line (in company column of\r\nfours) and two companies in support. The Egyptian brigades usually\r\nmarched with three battalions in the front line and one in reserve, each\r\nof the three in the front line having four companies in front and two in\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the moving army--the grand army of the Nile--as it\r\nadvanced towards its goal was especially wonderful in the clear air\r\nof the early morning; a long row of great brown masses of infantry\r\nand artillery, with a fringe of cavalry dotting the plain for miles in\r\nfront, with the Camel Corps--chocolate-coloured men on cream-coloured\r\ncamels--stretching into the desert on the right, and the white gunboats\r\nstealing silently up the river on the left, scrutinising the banks\r\nwith their guns; while far in rear the transport trailed away into the\r\nmirage, and far in front the field-glass disclosed the enemy's patrols.\r\nDay after day and hour after hour the advance was maintained. Arrived at\r\nthe camping-ground, the zeriba had to be built; and this involved a\r\nlong afternoon of fatigue. In the evening, when the dusty, tired-out\r\nsquadrons returned, the troopers attended to their horses, and so\r\nwent to sleep in peace. It was then that the dusty, tired-out infantry\r\nprovided sentries and pickets, who in a ceaseless succession paced the\r\nzeriba and guarded its occupants.\r\n\r\nThe position of the next camp was a strong one, on a high swell of open\r\nground which afforded a clear field of fire in every direction. Everyone\r\nthat night lay down to sleep with a feeling of keen expectancy. One way\r\nor the other all doubts would be settled the next day. The cavalry would\r\nride over the Kerreri Hills, if they were not occupied by the enemy,\r\nand right up to the walls of Omdurman. If the Dervishes had any army--if\r\nthere was to be any battle--we should know within a few hours. The\r\ntelegrams which were despatched that evening were the last to reach\r\nEngland before the event. During the night heavy rain fell, and all the\r\ncountry was drenched. The telegraph-wire had been laid along the ground,\r\nas there had been no time to pole it. The sand when dry is a sufficient\r\ninsulator, but when wet its non-conductivity is destroyed. Hence\r\nall communications ceased, and those at home who had husbands, sons,\r\nbrothers, or friends in the Expeditionary Force were left in an\r\nuncertainty as great as that in which we slept--and far more painful.\r\n\r\nThe long day had tired everyone. Indeed, the whole fortnight since the\r\ncavalry convoy had started from the Atbara had been a period of great\r\nexertion, and the Lancers, officers and men, were glad to eat a hasty\r\nmeal, and forget the fatigues of the day, the hardness of the ground,\r\nand the anticipations of the morrow in deep sleep. The camp was watched\r\nby the infantry, whose labours did not end with the daylight. At two\r\no'clock in the morning the clouds broke in rain and storm. Great blue\r\nflashes of lightning lit up the wide expanse of sleeping figures, of\r\ncrowded animals, and of shelters fluttering in the wind; and from\r\nthe centre of the camp it was even possible to see for an instant\r\nthe continuous line of sentries who watched throughout the night with\r\nceaseless vigilance. Nor was this all. Far away, near the Kerreri Hills,\r\nthe yellow light of a burning village shot up, unquenched by the rain,\r\nand only invisible in the brightest flashes of the lightning. There was\r\nwar to the southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British and Egyptian cavalry, supported by the Camel Corps and Horse\r\nArtillery, trotted out rapidly, and soon interposed a distance of eight\r\nmiles between them and the army. As before, the 21st Lancers were on the\r\nleft nearest the river, and the Khedivial squadrons curved backwards\r\nin a wide half-moon to protect the right flank. Meanwhile the gunboat\r\nflotilla was seen to be in motion. The white boats began to ascend the\r\nstream leisurely. Yet their array was significant. Hitherto they had\r\nmoved at long and indefinite intervals--one following perhaps a mile,\r\nor even two miles, behind the other. Now a regular distance of about\r\n300 yards was observed. The orders of the cavalry were to reconnoitre\r\nOmdurman; of the gunboats to bombard it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the squadrons of the 21st Lancers had turned the shoulder of\r\nthe steep Kerreri Hills, we saw in the distance a yellow-brown pointed\r\ndome rising above the blurred horizon. It was the Mahdi's Tomb, standing\r\nin the very heart of Omdurman. From the high ground the field-glass\r\ndisclosed rows and rows of mud houses, making a dark patch on the brown\r\nof the plain. To the left the river, steel-grey in the morning light,\r\nforked into two channels, and on the tongue of land between them the\r\ngleam of a white building showed among the trees. Before us were the\r\nruins of Khartoum and the confluence of the Blue and White Niles.\r\n\r\nA black, solitary hill rose between the Kerreri position and Omdurman.\r\nA long, low ridge running from it concealed the ground beyond. For the\r\nrest there was a wide-rolling, sandy plain of great extent, surrounded\r\non three sides by rocky hills and ridges, and patched with coarse,\r\nstarveling grass or occasional bushes. By the banks of the river which\r\nframed the picture on the left stood a straggling mud village, and\r\nthis, though we did not know it, was to be the field of Omdurman. It was\r\ndeserted. Not a living creature could be seen. And now there were many\r\nwho said once and for all that there would be no fight; for here we were\r\narrived at the very walls of Omdurman, and never an enemy to bar our\r\npath. Then, with four squadrons looking very tiny on the broad expanse\r\nof ground, we moved steadily forward, and at the same time the Egyptian\r\ncavalry and the Camel Corps entered the plain several miles further to\r\nthe west, and they too began to trot across it.\r\n\r\nIt was about three miles to the last ridge which lay between us and the\r\ncity. If there was a Dervish army, if there was to be a battle, if the\r\nKhalifa would maintain his boast and accept the arbitrament of war, much\r\nmust be visible from that ridge. We looked over. At first nothing was\r\napparent except the walls and houses of Omdurman and the sandy plain\r\nsloping up from the river to distant hills. Then four miles away on\r\nour right front emerged a long black line with white spots. It was the\r\nenemy. It seemed to us, as we looked, that there might be 3,000 men\r\nbehind a high dense zeriba of thorn-bushes. That, said the officers, was\r\nbetter than nothing. It is scarcely necessary to describe our tortuous\r\nmovements towards the Dervish position. Looking at it now from one point\r\nof view, now from another, but always edging nearer, the cavalry slowly\r\napproached, and halted in the plain about three miles away--three great\r\nserpents of men--the light-coloured one, the 21st Lancers; a much longer\r\nand a blacker one, the Egyptian squadrons; a mottled one, the Camel\r\nCorps and Horse Artillery. From this distance a clearer view was\r\npossible, and we distinguished many horsemen riding about the flanks and\r\nfront of the broad dark line which crowned the crest of the slope. A\r\nfew of these rode carelessly towards the squadrons to look at them. They\r\nwere not apparently acquainted with the long range of the Lee-Metford\r\ncarbine. Several troops were dismounted, and at 800 yards fire was\r\nmade on them. Two were shot and fell to the ground. Their companions,\r\ndismounting, examined them, picked up one, let the other lie, and\r\nresumed their ride, without acknowledging the bullets by even an\r\nincrease of pace.\r\n\r\nWhile this passed, so did the time. It was now nearly eleven o'clock.\r\nSuddenly the whole black line which seemed to be zeriba began to move.\r\nIt was made of men, not bushes. Behind it other immense masses and lines\r\nof men appeared over the crest; and while we watched, amazed by the\r\nwonder of the sight, the whole face of the slope became black with\r\nswarming savages. Four miles from end to end, and, as it seemed, in five\r\ngreat divisions, this mighty army advanced--swiftly. The whole side\r\nof the hill seemed to move. Between the masses horsemen galloped\r\ncontinually; before them many patrols dotted the plain; above them waved\r\nhundreds of banners, and the sun, glinting on many thousand hostile\r\nspear-points, spread a sparkling cloud.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the Khalifa had succeeded in concentrating at\r\nOmdurman an army of more than 60,000 men. He remembered that all the\r\nformer victories over the Egyptians had been won by the Dervishes\r\nattacking. He knew that in all the recent defeats they had stood on\r\nthe defensive. He therefore determined not to oppose the advance at the\r\nShabluka or on the march thence to Omdurman. All was to be staked on the\r\nissue of a great battle on the plains of Kerreri. The Mahdi's prophecy\r\nwas propitious. The strength of the Dervish army seemed overwhelming.\r\nWhen the 'Turks' arrived, they should be driven into the river.\r\nAccordingly the Khalifa had only watched the advance of the\r\nExpeditionary Force from Wad Hamed with a patrol of cavalry about 200\r\nstrong. On the 30th he was informed that the enemy drew near, and on the\r\n31st he assembled his bodyguard and regular army, with the exception of\r\nthe men needed for the river batteries, on the Omdurman parade ground.\r\nHe harangued the leaders; and remained encamped with his troops during\r\nthe night. The next day all the male population of the city were\r\ncompelled to join the army in the field, and only the gunners and\r\ngarrisons on the river-face remained within. In spite, however, of his\r\nutmost vigilance, nearly 6,000 men deserted during the nights of the\r\n31st of August and the 1st of September. This and the detachments in the\r\nforts reduced the force actually engaged in the battle to 52,000 men.\r\nThe host that now advanced towards the British and Egyptian cavalry was\r\nperhaps 4,000 stronger.\r\n\r\nTheir array was regular and precise, and, facing northeast, stretched\r\nfor more than four miles from flank to flank. A strong detachment of the\r\nmulazemin or guard was extended in front of the centre. Ali-Wad-Helu,\r\nwith his bright green flag, prolonged the line to the left; and his\r\n5,000 warriors, chiefly of the Degheim and Kenana tribes, soon began to\r\nreach out towards the Egyptian cavalry. The centre and main force of the\r\narmy was composed of the regular troops, formed in squares under Osman\r\nSheikh-ed-Din and Osman Azrak. This great body comprised 12,000 black\r\nriflemen and about 13,000 black and Arab spearmen. In their midst rose\r\nthe large, dark green flag which the Sheikh-ed-Din had adopted to annoy\r\nAli-Wad-Helu, of whose distinctive emblem he was inordinately jealous.\r\nThe Khalifa with his own bodyguard, about 2,000 strong, followed the\r\ncentre. In rear of all marched Yakub with the Black Flag and 13,000\r\nmen--nearly all swordsmen and spearmen, who with those extended in front\r\nof the army constituted the guard. The right wing was formed by the\r\nbrigade of the Khalifa Sherif, consisting of 2,000 Danagla tribesmen,\r\nwhose principal ensign was a broad red flag. Osman Digna, with about\r\n1,700 Hadendoa, guarded the extreme right and the flank nearest\r\nOmdurman, and his fame needed no flag. Such was the great army which now\r\nmoved swiftly towards the watching squadrons; and these, pausing on the\r\nsandy ridge, pushed out a fringe of tentative patrols, as if to assure\r\nthemselves that what they saw was real.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian cavalry had meanwhile a somewhat different view of the\r\nspectacle. Working on the right of the 21st Lancers, and keeping further\r\nfrom the river, the leading squadrons had reached the extreme western\r\nend of the Kerreri ridge at about seven o'clock. From here the Mahdi's\r\nTomb was visible, and, since the rocks of Surgham did not obstruct\r\nthe view from this point, the British officers, looking through their\r\nfield-glasses, saw what appeared to be a long column of brown spots\r\nmoving south-westwards across the wide plain which stretches away to the\r\nwest of Omdurman. The telescope, an invaluable aid to reconnaissance,\r\ndeveloped the picture. The brown objects proved to be troops of horses\r\ngrazing; and beyond, to the southward, camels and white flapping tents\r\ncould be distinguished. There were no signs that a retreat was in\r\nprogress; but from such a distance--nearly four miles--no certain\r\ninformation could be obtained, and Colonel Broadwood decided to advance\r\ncloser. He accordingly led his whole command south-westward towards\r\na round-topped hill which rose about four miles from the end of the\r\nKerreri ridge and was one of the more distant hill features bounding the\r\nplain on the western side. The Egyptian cavalry moved slowly across the\r\ndesert to this new point of observation. On their way they traversed the\r\nend of the Khor Shambat, a long depression which is the natural drainage\r\nchannel of the plains of Kerreri and Omdurman, and joins the Nile about\r\nfour miles from the city. The heavy rain of the previous night had made\r\nthe low ground swampy, and pools of water stood in the soft, wet sand.\r\nThe passage, however, presented no great difficulty, and at half-past\r\neleven the Egyptian squadrons began to climb the lower slopes of the\r\nround-topped hill. Here the whole scene burst suddenly upon them.\r\nScarcely three miles away the Dervish army was advancing with the\r\nregularity of parade. The south wind carried the martial sound of horns\r\nand drums and--far more menacing--the deep murmur of a multitude to the\r\nastonished officers. Like the 21st Lancers--three miles away to their\r\nleft, at the end of the long sandy ridge which runs westward from\r\nSurgham--the soldiers remained for a space spell-bound. But all eyes\r\nwere soon drawn from the thrilling spectacle of the Dervish advance by\r\nthe sound of guns on the river.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o'clock the gunboats had ascended the Nile, and now\r\nengaged the enemy's batteries on both banks. Throughout the day the loud\r\nreports of their guns could be heard, and, looking from our position\r\non the ridge, we could see the white vessels steaming slowly forward\r\nagainst the current, under clouds of black smoke from their furnaces and\r\namid other clouds of white smoke from the artillery. The forts, which\r\nmounted nearly fifty guns, replied vigorously; but the British aim was\r\naccurate and their fire crushing. The embrasures were smashed to bits\r\nand many of the Dervish guns dismounted. The rifle trenches which\r\nflanked the forts were swept by the Maxim guns. The heavier projectiles,\r\nstriking the mud walls of the works and houses, dashed the red dust high\r\ninto the air and scattered destruction around. Despite the tenacity and\r\ncourage of the Dervish gunners, they were driven from their defences and\r\ntook refuge among the streets of the city. The great wall of Omdurman\r\nwas breached in many places, and a large number of unfortunate\r\nnon-combatants were killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Arab irregulars, under Major Wortley, had been sharply\r\nengaged. That officer's orders were to co-operate with the flotilla by\r\ntaking in rear the forts and fortified villages on the east bank of\r\nthe river. As soon as the gunboats had silenced the lower forts, Major\r\nWortley ordered the irregulars to advance on them and on the houses. He\r\nplaced the Jaalin, who were practically the only trustworthy men in his\r\nforce, in reserve, and formed the tribes according to their capabilities\r\nand prejudices. On the order to attack being given, the whole force,\r\nsome 3,000 strong, advanced on the buildings, from which the Dervishes\r\nat once opened fire. Arrived within 500 yards they halted, and began to\r\ndischarge their rifles in the air; they also indulged in frantic\r\ndances expressive of their fury and valour, but declined to advance any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nMajor Wortley then ordered the Jaalin to attack. These--formed in a long\r\ncolumn, animated by the desire for vengeance, and being besides brave\r\nmen--moved upon the village at a slow pace, and, surrounding one house\r\nafter another, captured it and slew all its defenders; including the\r\nDervish Emir and 350 of his followers. The Jaalin themselves suffered a\r\nloss of about sixty killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe village being captured, and the enemy on the east bank killed or\r\ndispersed, the gunboats proceeded to engage the batteries higher up the\r\nriver. The howitzer battery was now landed, and at 1.30 began to bombard\r\nthe Mahdi's Tomb. This part of the proceedings was plainly visible to\r\nus, waiting and watching on the ridge, and its interest even distracted\r\nattention from the Dervish army. The dome of the tomb rose tall and\r\nprominent above the mud houses of the city. A lyddite shell burst over\r\nit--a great flash, a white ball of smoke, and, after a pause, the dull\r\nthud of the distant explosion. Another followed. At the third shot,\r\ninstead of the white smoke, there was a prodigious cloud of red dust,\r\nin which the whole tomb disappeared. When this cleared away we saw that,\r\ninstead of being pointed, it was now flat-topped. Other shells continued\r\nto strike it with like effect, some breaking holes in the dome, others\r\nsmashing off the cupolas, all enveloping it in dust.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Dervishes were coming nearer, and the steady and\r\ncontinuous advance of the great army compelled the Egyptian cavalry to\r\nmount their horses and trot off to some safer point of view. Colonel\r\nBroadwood conceived his direct line of retreat to camp threatened, and\r\nshortly after one o'clock he began a regular retirement. Eight squadrons\r\nof Egyptian cavalry and the Horse Artillery moved off first. Five\r\ncompanies of the Camel Corps, a Maxim gun section, and the ninth\r\nsquadron of cavalry followed as a rear-guard under Major Tudway. The\r\nDervish horsemen contented themselves with firing occasional shots,\r\nwhich were replied to by the Camel Corps with volleys whenever the\r\nground was suited to dismounted action. From time to time one of the\r\nmore daring Arabs would gallop after the retreating squadrons, but\r\na shot from a carbine or a threatened advance always brought the\r\nadventurous horseman to a halt. The retirement was continued without\r\nserious interference, and the boggy ground of the Khor Shambat was\r\nrecrossed in safety.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Egyptian squadrons--a darker mass under the dark hills\r\nto the westward--were seen to be in retirement, the 21st Lancers were\r\nwithdrawn slowly along the sandy ridge towards the rocks of Surgham--the\r\nposition whence we had first seen the Dervish army. The regiment wheeled\r\nabout and fell back by alternate wings, dropping two detached troops to\r\nthe rear and flanks to make the enemy's patrols keep their distance.\r\nBut when the Arab horsemen saw all the cavalry retiring they became very\r\nbold, and numerous small groups of fives and sixes began to draw\r\nnearer at a trot. Accordingly, whenever the ground was favourable, the\r\nsquadrons halted in turn for a few minutes to fire on them. In this way\r\nperhaps half-a-dozen were killed or wounded. The others, however, paid\r\nlittle attention to the bullets, and continued to pry curiously, until\r\nat last it was thought necessary to send a troop to drive them away. The\r\nscore of Lancers galloped back towards the inquisitive patrols in\r\nthe most earnest fashion. The Dervishes, although more numerous, were\r\nscattered about in small parties, and, being unable to collect,\r\nthey declined the combat. The great army, however, still advanced\r\nmajestically, pressing the cavalry back before it; and it was evident\r\nthat if the Khalifa's movement continued, in spite of it being nearly\r\none o'clock, there would be a collision between the main forces before\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the black hill of Surgham the scene was\r\nextraordinary. The great army of Dervishes was dwarfed by the size of\r\nthe landscape to mere dark smears and smudges on the brown of the plain.\r\nLooking east, another army was now visible--the British and Egyptian\r\narmy. All six brigades had passed the Kerreri Hills, and now stood drawn\r\nup in a crescent, with their backs to the Nile. The transport and the\r\nhouses of the village of Egeiga filled the enclosed space. Neither force\r\ncould see the other, though but five miles divided them. The array of\r\nthe enemy was, without doubt, both longer and deeper. Yet there seemed a\r\nsuperior strength in the solid battalions, whose lines were so straight\r\nthat they might have been drawn with a ruler.\r\n\r\nThe camp presented an animated appearance. The troops had piled arms\r\nafter the march, and had already built a slender hedge of thorn-bushes\r\naround them. Now they were eating their dinners, and in high expectation\r\nof a fight. The whole army had been ordered to stand to arms at two\r\no'clock in formation to resist the attack which it seemed the Dervishes\r\nwere about to deliver. But at a quarter to two the Dervish army halted.\r\nTheir drill was excellent, and they all stopped as by a single command.\r\nThen suddenly their riflemen discharged their rifles in the air with a\r\ngreat roar--a barbaric feu de joie. The smoke sprang up along the whole\r\nfront of their array, running from one end to the other. After this they\r\nlay down on the ground, and it became certain that the matter would not\r\nbe settled that day. We remained in our position among the sandhills\r\nof the ridge until the approach of darkness, and during the afternoon\r\nvarious petty encounters took place between our patrols and those of the\r\nenemy, resulting in a loss to them of about a dozen killed and wounded,\r\nand to us of one corporal wounded and one horse killed. Then, as the\r\nlight failed, we returned to the river to water and encamp, passing into\r\nthe zeriba through the ranks of the British division, where officers and\r\nmen, looking out steadfastly over the fading plain, asked us whether\r\nthe enemy were coming--and, if so, when. And it was with confidence and\r\nsatisfaction that we replied, and they heard, 'Probably at daylight.'\r\n\r\nWhen the gunboats had completed their bombardment, had sunk a Dervish\r\nsteamer, had silenced all the hostile batteries, and had sorely battered\r\nthe Mahdi's Tomb, they returned leisurely to the camp, and lay moored\r\nclose to the bank to lend the assistance of their guns in case of\r\nattack. As the darkness became complete they threw their powerful\r\nsearchlights over the front of the zeriba and on to the distant hills.\r\nThe wheeling beams of dazzling light swept across the desolate, yet not\r\ndeserted, plain. The Dervish army lay for the night along the eastern\r\nslope of the Shambat depression. All the 50,000 faithful warriors rested\r\nin their companies near the flags of their Emirs. The Khalifa slept in\r\nrear of the centre of his host, surrounded by his generals. Suddenly the\r\nwhole scene was lit by a pale glare. Abdullah and the chiefs sprang up.\r\nEverything around them was bathed in an awful white illumination. Far\r\naway by the river there gleamed a brilliant circle of light--the cold,\r\npitiless eye of a demon. The Khalifa put his hand on Osman Azrak's\r\nshoulder--Osman, who was to lead the frontal attack at dawn--and\r\nwhispered, 'What is this strange thing?' 'Sire,' replied Osman, 'they\r\nare looking at us.' Thereat a great fear filled all their minds. The\r\nKhalifa had a small tent, which showed conspicuously in the searchlight.\r\nHe had it hurriedly pulled down. Some of the Emirs covered their faces,\r\nlest the baleful rays should blind them. All feared that some terrible\r\nprojectile would follow in the path of the light. And then suddenly it\r\npassed on--for the sapper who worked the lens could see nothing at that\r\ndistance but the brown plain--and swept along the ranks of the sleeping\r\narmy, rousing up the startled warriors, as a wind sweeps over a field of\r\nstanding corn.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Egyptian army had not formed a quadrilateral camp, as on other\r\nnights, but had lain down to rest in the formation for attack they had\r\nassumed in the afternoon. Every fifty yards behind the thorn-bushes were\r\ndouble sentries. Every hundred yards a patrol with an officer was to be\r\nmet. Fifty yards in rear of this line lay the battalions, the men in all\r\ntheir ranks, armed and accoutred, but sprawled into every conceivable\r\nattitude which utter weariness could suggest or dictate. The enemy,\r\ntwice as strong as the Expeditionary Force, were within five miles. They\r\nhad advanced that day with confidence and determination. But it seemed\r\nimpossible to believe that they would attack by daylight across the open\r\nground. Two explanations of their advance and halt presented themselves.\r\nEither they had offered battle in a position where they could not\r\nthemselves be attacked until four o'clock in the afternoon, and hoped\r\nthat the Sirdar's army, even though victorious, would have to fight a\r\nrear-guard action in the darkness to the river; or they intended to make\r\na night attack. It was not likely that an experienced commander would\r\naccept battle at so late an hour in the day. If the Dervishes were\r\nanxious to attack, so much the worse for them. But the army would\r\nremain strictly on the defensive--at any rate, until there was plenty of\r\ndaylight. The alternative remained--a night attack.\r\n\r\nHere lay the great peril which threatened the expedition. What was to be\r\ndone with the troops during the hours of darkness? In the daytime they\r\nrecked little of their enemy. But at night, when 400 yards was the\r\nextreme range at which their fire could be opened, it was a matter of\r\ngrave doubt whether the front could be kept and the attack repelled. The\r\nconsequences of the line being penetrated in the darkness were appalling\r\nto think of. The sudden appearance of crowds of figures swarming to the\r\nattack through the gloom; the wild outburst of musketry and artillery\r\nall along the zeriba; the crowds still coming on in spite of the\r\nbullets; the fire getting uncontrolled, and then a great bunching and\r\ncrumpling of some part of the front, and mad confusion, in which a\r\nmultitude of fierce swordsmen would surge through the gap, cutting\r\nand slashing at every living thing; in which transport animals would\r\nstampede and rush wildly in all directions, upsetting every formation\r\nand destroying all attempts to restore order; in which regiments and\r\nbrigades would shift for themselves and fire savagely on all sides,\r\nslaying alike friend and foe; and out of which only a few thousand,\r\nperhaps only a few hundred, demoralised men would escape in barges and\r\nsteamers to tell the tale of ruin and defeat.\r\n\r\nThe picture--true or false--flamed before the eyes of all the leaders\r\nthat night; but, whatever their thoughts may have been, their tactics\r\nwere bold. Whatever advice was given, whatever opinions were expressed,\r\nthe responsibility was Sir Herbert Kitchener's. Upon his shoulders lay\r\nthe burden, and the decision that was taken must be attributed solely to\r\nhim. He might have formed the army into a solid mass of men and animals,\r\narranged the infantry four deep all round the perimeter, and dug as big\r\na ditch or built as high a zeriba as time allowed. He might have filled\r\nthe numerous houses with the infantry, making them join the buildings\r\nwith hasty entrenchments, and so enclose a little space in which to\r\nsqueeze cavalry, transport, and guns. Instead he formed his army in\r\na long thin curve, resting on the river and enclosing a wide area of\r\nground, about which baggage and animals were scattered in open order\r\nand luxurious accommodation. His line was but two deep; and only two\r\ncompanies per battalion and one Egyptian brigade (Collinson's) were in\r\nreserve. He thus obtained the greatest possible development of fire,\r\nand waited, prepared if necessary to stake everything on the arms of\r\nprecision, but hoping with fervour that he would not be compelled to\r\ngamble by night.\r\n\r\nThe night was, however, undisturbed; and the moonlit camp, with\r\nits anxious generals, its weary soldiers, its fearful machinery of\r\ndestruction, all strewn along the bank of the great river, remained\r\nplunged in silence, as if brooding over the chances of the morrow and\r\nthe failures of the past. And hardly four miles away another army--twice\r\nas numerous, equally confident, equally brave--were waiting impatiently\r\nfor the morning and the final settlement of the long quarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: THE BATTLE OF OMDURMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 2, 1898\r\n\r\nThe bugles all over the camp by the river began to sound at half-past\r\nfour. The cavalry trumpets and the drums and fifes of the British\r\ndivision joined the chorus, and everyone awoke amid a confusion of\r\nmerry or defiant notes. Then it grew gradually lighter, and the cavalry\r\nmounted their horses, the infantry stood to their arms, and the gunners\r\nwent to their batteries; while the sun, rising over the Nile, revealed\r\nthe wide plain, the dark rocky hills, and the waiting army. It was as\r\nif all the preliminaries were settled, the ground cleared, and nothing\r\nremained but the final act and 'the rigour of the game.'\r\n\r\nEven before it became light several squadrons of British and Egyptian\r\ncavalry were pushed swiftly forward to gain contact with the enemy and\r\nlearn his intentions. The first of these, under Captain Baring, occupied\r\nSurgham Hill, and waited in the gloom until the whereabouts of\r\nthe Dervishes should be disclosed by the dawn. It was a perilous\r\nundertaking, for he might have found them unexpectedly near. As the sun\r\nrose, the 21st Lancers trotted out of the zeriba and threw out a spray\r\nof officers' patrols. As there had been no night attack, it was expected\r\nthat the Dervish army would have retired to their original position\r\nor entered the town. It was hardly conceivable that they would advance\r\nacross the open ground to attack the zeriba by daylight. Indeed, it\r\nappeared more probable that their hearts had failed them in the night,\r\nand that they had melted away into the desert. But these anticipations\r\nwere immediately dispelled by the scene which was visible from the crest\r\nof the ridge.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter to six. The light was dim, but growing stronger every\r\nminute. There in the plain lay the enemy, their numbers unaltered,\r\ntheir confidence and intentions apparently unshaken. Their front was\r\nnow nearly five miles long, and composed of great masses of men joined\r\ntogether by thinner lines. Behind and near to the flanks were large\r\nreserves. From the ridge they looked dark blurs and streaks, relieved\r\nand diversified with an odd-looking shimmer of light from the\r\nspear-points. At about ten minutes to six it was evident that the masses\r\nwere in motion and advancing swiftly. Their Emirs galloped about and\r\nbefore their ranks. Scouts and patrols scattered themselves all over the\r\nfront. Then they began to cheer. They were still a mile away from the\r\nhill, and were concealed from the Sirdar's army by the folds of the\r\nground. The noise of the shouting was heard, albeit faintly, by the\r\ntroops down by the river. But to those watching on the hill a tremendous\r\nroar came up in waves of intense sound, like the tumult of the rising\r\nwind and sea before a storm.\r\n\r\nThe British and Egyptian forces were arranged in line, with their back\r\nto the river. The flanks were secured by the gunboats lying moored in\r\nthe stream. Before them was the rolling sandy plain, looking from the\r\nslight elevation of the ridge smooth and flat as a table. To the right\r\nrose the rocky hills of the Kerreri position, near which the Egyptian\r\ncavalry were drawn up--a dark solid mass of men and horses. On the left\r\nthe 21st Lancers, with a single squadron thrown out in advance, were\r\nhalted watching their patrols, who climbed about Surgham Hill, stretched\r\nforward beyond it, or perched, as we did, on the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe ground sloped gently up from the river; so that it seemed as if the\r\nlandward ends of the Surgham and Kerreri ridges curved in towards each\r\nother, enclosing what lay between. Beyond the long swell of sand which\r\nformed the western wall of this spacious amphitheatre the black shapes\r\nof the distant hills rose in misty confusion. The challengers were\r\nalready in the arena; their antagonists swiftly approached.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Dervishes were steadily advancing, a belief that their\r\nmusketry was inferior encouraged a nearer view, and we trotted round the\r\nsouth-west slopes of Surgham Hill until we reached the sandhills on the\r\nenemy's side, among which the regiment had waited the day before. Thence\r\nthe whole array was visible in minute detail. It seemed that every\r\nsingle man of all the thousands could be examined separately. The pace\r\nof their march was fast and steady, and it was evident that it would not\r\nbe safe to wait long among the sandhills. Yet the wonder of the scene\r\nexercised a dangerous fascination, and for a while we tarried.\r\n\r\nThe emblems of the more famous Emirs were easily distinguishable. On the\r\nextreme left the chiefs and soldiers of the bright green flag gathered\r\nunder Ali-Wad-Helu; between this and the centre the large dark green\r\nflag of Osman Sheikh-ed-Din rose above a dense mass of spearmen,\r\npreceded by long lines of warriors armed presumably with rifles; over\r\nthe centre, commanded by Yakub, the sacred Black banner of the Khalifa\r\nfloated high and remarkable; while on the right a great square of\r\nDervishes was arrayed under an extraordinary number of white flags,\r\namid which the red ensign of Sherif was almost hidden. All the pride and\r\nmight of the Dervish Empire were massed on this last great day of its\r\nexistence. Riflemen who had helped to destroy Hicks, spearmen who had\r\ncharged at Abu Klea, Emirs who saw the sack of Gondar, Baggara fresh\r\nfrom raiding the Shillooks, warriors who had besieged Khartoum--all\r\nmarched, inspired by the memories of former triumphs and embittered by\r\nthe knowledge of late defeats, to chastise the impudent and accursed\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nThe advance continued. The Dervish left began to stretch out across\r\nthe plain towards Kerreri--as I thought, to turn our right flank. Their\r\ncentre, under the Black Flag, moved directly towards Surgham. The right\r\npursued a line of advance south of that hill. This mass of men were the\r\nmost striking of all. They could not have mustered fewer than 6,000.\r\nTheir array was perfect. They displayed a great number of flags--perhaps\r\n500--which looked at the distance white, though they were really covered\r\nwith texts from the Koran, and which by their admirable alignment made\r\nthis division of the Khalifa's army look like the old representations of\r\nthe Crusaders in the Bayeux tapestry.\r\n\r\nThe attack developed. The left, nearly 20,000 strong, toiled across the\r\nplain and approached the Egyptian squadrons. The leading masses of the\r\ncentre deployed facing the zeriba and marched forthwith to the direct\r\nassault. As the whole Dervish army continued to advance, the division\r\nwith the white flags, which had until now been echeloned in rear of\r\ntheir right, moved up into the general line and began to climb the\r\nsouthern slopes of Surgham Hill. Meanwhile yet another body of the\r\nenemy, comparatively insignificant in numbers, who had been drawn up\r\nbehind the 'White Flags,' were moving slowly towards the Nile, echeloned\r\nstill further behind their right, and not far from the suburbs of\r\nOmdurman. These men had evidently been posted to prevent the Dervish\r\narmy being cut off from the city and to secure their line of retreat;\r\nand with them the 21st Lancers were destined to have a much closer\r\nacquaintance about two hours later.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish centre had come within range. But it was not the British and\r\nEgyptian army that began the battle. If there was one arm in which the\r\nArabs were beyond all comparison inferior to their adversaries, it was\r\nin guns. Yet it was with this arm that they opened their attack. In\r\nthe middle of the Dervish line now marching in frontal assault were\r\ntwo puffs of smoke. About fifty yards short of the thorn fence two red\r\nclouds of sand and dust sprang up, where the projectiles had struck. It\r\nlooked like a challenge. It was immediately answered. Great clouds\r\nof smoke appeared all along the front of the British and Soudanese\r\nbrigades. One after another four batteries opened on the enemy at a\r\nrange of about 3,000 yards. The sound of the cannonade rolled up to us\r\non the ridge, and was re-echoed by the hills. Above the heads of the\r\nmoving masses shells began to burst, dotting the air with smoke-balls\r\nand the ground with bodies. But a nearer tragedy impended. The 'White\r\nFlags' were nearly over the crest. In another minute they would become\r\nvisible to the batteries. Did they realise what would come to meet them?\r\nThey were in a dense mass, 2,800 yards from the 32nd Field Battery and\r\nthe gunboats. The ranges were known. It was a matter of machinery. The\r\nmore distant slaughter passed unnoticed, as the mind was fascinated by\r\nthe approaching horror. In a few seconds swift destruction would rush\r\non these brave men. They topped the crest and drew out into full view of\r\nthe whole army. Their white banners made them conspicuous above all. As\r\nthey saw the camp of their enemies, they discharged their rifles with a\r\ngreat roar of musketry and quickened their pace. For a moment the white\r\nflags advanced in regular order, and the whole division crossed the\r\ncrest and were exposed. Forthwith the gunboats, the 32nd British Field\r\nBattery, and other guns from the zeriba opened on them. About twenty\r\nshells struck them in the first minute. Some burst high in the air,\r\nothers exactly in their faces. Others, again, plunged into the sand and,\r\nexploding, dashed clouds of red dust, splinters, and bullets amid their\r\nranks. The white banners toppled over in all directions. Yet they rose\r\nagain immediately, as other men pressed forward to die for the Mahdi's\r\nsacred cause and in the defence of the successor of the True Prophet.\r\nIt was a terrible sight, for as yet they had not hurt us at all, and it\r\nseemed an unfair advantage to strike thus cruelly when they could not\r\nreply. Under the influence of the shells the mass of the 'White Flags'\r\ndissolved into thin lines of spearmen and skirmishers, and came on in\r\naltered formation and diminished numbers, but with unabated enthusiasm.\r\nAnd now, the whole attack being thoroughly exposed, it became the duty\r\nof the cavalry to clear the front as quickly as possible, and leave the\r\nfurther conduct of the debate to the infantry and the Maxim guns.\r\nAll the patrols trotted or cantered back to their squadrons, and the\r\nregiment retired swiftly into the zeriba, while the shells from the\r\ngunboats screamed overhead and the whole length of the position began\r\nto burst into flame and smoke. Nor was it long before the tremendous\r\nbanging of the artillery was swollen by the roar of musketry.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the shelter of the river-bank, the cavalry\r\ndismounted; we watered our horses, waited, and wondered what was\r\nhappening. And every moment the tumult grew louder and more intense,\r\nuntil even the flickering stutter of the Maxims could scarcely be heard\r\nabove the continuous din. Eighty yards away, and perhaps twenty feet\r\nabove us, the 32nd Field Battery was in action. The nimble figures of\r\nthe gunners darted about as they busied themselves in their complicated\r\nprocess of destruction. The officers, some standing on biscuit-boxes,\r\npeered through their glasses and studied the effect. Of this I had one\r\nglimpse. Eight hundred yards away a ragged line of men were coming on\r\ndesperately, struggling forward in the face of the pitiless fire--white\r\nbanners tossing and collapsing; white figures subsiding in dozens to\r\nthe ground; little white puffs from their rifles, larger white puffs\r\nspreading in a row all along their front from the bursting shrapnel.\r\n\r\nThe infantry fired steadily and stolidly, without hurry or excitement,\r\nfor the enemy were far away and the officers careful. Besides, the\r\nsoldiers were interested in the work and took great pains. But presently\r\nthe mere physical act became tedious. The tiny figures seen over the\r\nslide of the backsight seemed a little larger, but also fewer at each\r\nsuccessive volley. The rifles grew hot--so hot that they had to be\r\nchanged for those of the reserve companies. The Maxim guns exhausted\r\nall the water in their jackets, and several had to be refreshed from the\r\nwater-bottles of the Cameron Highlanders before they could go on with\r\ntheir deadly work. The empty cartridge-cases, tinkling to the ground,\r\nformed a small but growing heap beside each man. And all the time out\r\non the plain on the other side bullets were shearing through flesh,\r\nsmashing and splintering bone; blood spouted from terrible wounds;\r\nvaliant men were struggling on through a hell of whistling metal,\r\nexploding shells, and spurting dust--suffering, despairing, dying. Such\r\nwas the first phase of the battle of Omdurman.\r\n\r\nThe Khalifa's plan of attack appears to have been complex and ingenious.\r\nIt was, however, based on an extraordinary miscalculation of the power\r\nof modern weapons; with the exception of this cardinal error, it is\r\nnot necessary to criticise it. He first ordered about 15,000 men,\r\ndrawn chiefly from the army of Osman Sheikh-ed-Din and placed under the\r\ncommand of Osman Azrak, to deliver a frontal attack. He himself waited\r\nwith an equal force near Surgham Hill to watch the result. If it\r\nsucceeded, he would move forward with his bodyguard, the flower of the\r\nArab army, and complete the victory. If it failed, there was yet another\r\nchance. The Dervishes who were first launched against the zeriba,\r\nalthough very brave men, were not by any means his best or most reliable\r\ntroops. Their destruction might be a heavy loss, but it would not\r\nend the struggle. While the attack was proceeding, the valiant left,\r\nconsisting of the rest of the army of Osman Sheikh-ed-Din, might move\r\nunnoticed to the northern flank and curve round on to the front of the\r\nzeriba held by the Egyptian brigade. Ali-Wad-Helu was meanwhile to march\r\nto the Kerreri Hills, and remain out of range and, if possible, out\r\nof sight among them. Should the frontal and flank attacks be unhappily\r\nrepulsed, the 'enemies of God,' exulting in their easy victory over the\r\nfaithful, would leave their strong place and march to the capture and\r\nsack of the city. Then, while they were yet dispersed on the plain,\r\nwith no zeriba to protect them, the chosen warriors of the True Religion\r\nwould abandon all concealment, and hasten in their thousands to the\r\nutter destruction of the accursed--the Khalifa with 15,000 falling upon\r\nthem from behind Surgham; Ali-Wad-Helu and all that remained of Osman's\r\narmy assailing them from Kerreri. Attacked at once from the north and\r\nsouth, and encompassed on every side, the infidels would abandon hope\r\nand order, and Kitchener might share the fate of Hicks and Gordon. Two\r\ncircumstances, which will appear as the account proceeds, prevented\r\nthe accomplishment of this plan. The second attack was not executed\r\nsimultaneously by the two divisions of the Dervish army; and even had\r\nit been, the power of the musketry would have triumphed, and though the\r\nExpeditionary Force might have sustained heavier losses the main result\r\ncould not have been affected. The last hopes of barbarism had passed\r\nwith the shades of night.\r\n\r\nColonel Broadwood, with nine squadrons of cavalry, the Camel Corps, and\r\nthe Horse Artillery, had been ordered to check the Dervish left, and\r\nprevent it enveloping the downstream flank of the zeriba, as this was\r\nheld by the Egyptian brigade, which it was not thought desirable\r\nto expose to the full weight of an attack. With this object, as the\r\nDervishes approached, he had occupied the Kerreri ridge with the Horse\r\nbattery and the Camel Corps, holding his cavalry in reserve in rear of\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\nThe Kerreri ridge, to which reference has so frequently been made,\r\nconsists of two main features, which rise to the height of about 300\r\nfeet above the plain, are each above a mile long, and run nearly east\r\nand west, with a dip or trough about 1,000 yards wide between them.\r\nThe eastern ends of these main ridges are perhaps 1,000 yards from\r\nthe river, and in this intervening space there are several rocky\r\nunder-features and knolls. The Kerreri Hills, the spaces between them,\r\nand the smaller features are covered with rough boulders and angular\r\nstones of volcanic origin, which render the movements of horses and\r\ncamels difficult and painful.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry horses and camels were in the dip between the two ridges;\r\nand the dismounted men of the Camel Corps were deployed along the crest\r\nof the most southerly of the ridges, with their right at the desert end.\r\nNext in order to the Camel Corps, the centre of the ridge was occupied\r\nby the dismounted cavalry. The Horse Artillery were on the left. The\r\nremainder of the cavalry waited in the hollow behind the guns.\r\n\r\nThe tempestuous advance of Osman soon brought him into contact with the\r\nmounted force. His real intentions are still a matter of conjecture.\r\nWhether he had been ordered to attack the Egyptian brigade, or to drive\r\nback the cavalry, or to disappear behind the Kerreri Hills in conformity\r\nwith Ali-Wad-Helu, is impossible to pronounce. His action was, however,\r\nclear. He could not safely assail the Egyptians with a powerful cavalry\r\nforce threatening his left rear. He therefore continued his move across\r\nthe front of the zeriba. Keeping out of the range of infantry fire,\r\nbringing up his right, and marching along due north, he fell upon\r\nBroadwood. This officer, who had expected to have to deal with small\r\nbodies on the Dervish flank, found himself suddenly exposed to the\r\nattack of nearly 15,000 men, many of whom were riflemen. The Sirdar,\r\nseeing the situation from the zeriba, sent him an order to withdraw\r\nwithin the lines of infantry. Colonel Broadwood, however, preferred to\r\nretire through the Kerreri Hills to the northward, drawing Osman after\r\nhim. He replied to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe first position had soon to be abandoned. The Dervishes, advancing in\r\na north-easterly direction, attacked the Kerreri Hills obliquely. They\r\nimmediately enveloped the right flank of the mounted troops holding\r\nthem. It will be seen from the map that as soon as the Dervish riflemen\r\ngained a point west and in prolongation of the trough between the two\r\nridges, they not only turned the right flank, but also threatened the\r\nretreat of the defenders of the southerly ridge; for they were able to\r\nsweep the trough from end to end with their fire. As soon as it became\r\ncertain that the southerly ridge could not be held any longer, Colonel\r\nBroadwood retired the battery to the east end of the second or northern\r\nridge. This was scarcely accomplished when the dip was enfiladed, and\r\nthe cavalry and Camel Corps who followed lost about fifty men and many\r\nhorses and camels killed and wounded. The Camel Corps were the most\r\nunfortunate. They were soon encumbered with wounded, and it was now\r\npainfully evident that in rocky ground the Dervishes could go faster on\r\ntheir feet than the soldiers on their camels. Pressing on impetuously at\r\na pace of nearly seven miles an hour, and unchecked by a heavy artillery\r\nfire from the zeriba and a less effective fire from the Horse battery,\r\nwhich was only armed with 7-pounder Krupps of an obsolete pattern,\r\nthe Arabs rapidly diminished the distance between themselves and their\r\nenemies. In these circumstances Colonel Broadwood decided to send\r\nthe Camel Corps back to the zeriba under cover of a gunboat, which,\r\nwatchfully observing the progress of the fight, was coming down stream\r\nto assist. The distance which divided the combatants was scarcely 400\r\nyards and decreasing every minute. The cavalry were drawn up across the\r\neastern or river end of the trough. The guns of the Horse battery fired\r\nsteadily from their new position on the northern ridge. But the Camel\r\nCorps were still struggling in the broken ground, and it was clear that\r\ntheir position was one of great peril. The Dervishes already carpeted\r\nthe rocks of the southern ridge with dull yellow swarms, and, heedless\r\nof the shells which still assailed them in reverse from the zeriba,\r\ncontinued to push their attack home. On the very instant that they saw\r\nthe Camel Corps make for the river they realised that those they had\r\ndeemed their prey were trying, like a hunted animal, to run to ground\r\nwithin the lines of infantry. With that instinctive knowledge of war\r\nwhich is the heritage of savage peoples, the whole attack swung to the\r\nright, changed direction from north to east, and rushed down the trough\r\nand along the southern ridge towards the Nile, with the plain intention\r\nof cutting off the Camel Corps and driving them into the river.\r\n\r\nThe moment was critical. It appeared to the cavalry commander that the\r\nDervishes would actually succeed, and their success must involve the\r\ntotal destruction of the Camel Corps. That could not, of course, be\r\ntolerated. The whole nine squadrons of cavalry assumed a preparatory\r\nformation. The British officers believed that a terrible charge\r\nimpended. They would meet in direct collision the swarms of men who were\r\nhurrying down the trough. The diversion might enable the Camel Corps to\r\nescape. But the ground was bad; the enemy's force was overwhelming; the\r\nEgyptian troopers were prepared to obey--but that was all. There was no\r\nexalted enthusiasm such as at these moments carries sterner breeds\r\nto victory. Few would return. Nevertheless, the operation appeared\r\ninevitable. The Camel Corps were already close to the river. But\r\nthousands of Dervishes were running swiftly towards them at right\r\nangles to their line of retreat, and it was certain that if the\r\ncamelry attempted to cross this new front of the enemy they would be\r\nannihilated. Their only hope lay in maintaining themselves by their fire\r\nnear the river-bank until help could reach them, and, in order to delay\r\nand weaken the Dervish attack the cavalry would have to make a desperate\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nBut at the critical moment the gunboat arrived on the scene and began\r\nsuddenly to blaze and flame from Maxim guns, quick-firing guns, and\r\nrifles. The range was short; the effect tremendous. The terrible\r\nmachine, floating gracefully on the waters--a beautiful white\r\ndevil--wreathed itself in smoke. The river slopes of the Kerreri Hills,\r\ncrowded with the advancing thousands, sprang up into clouds of dust and\r\nsplinters of rock. The charging Dervishes sank down in tangled heaps.\r\nThe masses in rear paused, irresolute. It was too hot even for them.\r\nThe approach of another gunboat completed their discomfiture. The\r\nCamel Corps, hurrying along the shore, slipped past the fatal point of\r\ninterception, and saw safety and the zeriba before them.\r\n\r\nExasperated by their disappointment, the soldiers of Osman Sheikh-ed-Din\r\nturned again upon the cavalry, and, forgetting in their anger the mobile\r\nnature of their foe, pursued the elusive squadrons three long miles to\r\nthe north. The cavalry, intensely relieved by the escape of the Camel\r\nCorps, played with their powerful antagonist, as the banderillo teases\r\nthe bull. Colonel Broadwood thus succeeded in luring this division of\r\nthe Dervish army far away from the field of battle, where they were\r\nsorely needed. The rough ground, however, delayed the Horse battery.\r\nThey lagged, as the Camel Corps had done, and caused constant anxiety.\r\nAt length two of their guns stuck fast in a marshy spot, and as several\r\nmen and horses were shot in the attempt to extricate them Broadwood\r\nwisely ordered them to be abandoned, and they were soon engulfed in\r\nthe Dervish masses. Encouraged by this capture, the horsemen of\r\nOsman's command daringly attacked the retreating cavalry. But they were\r\neffectually checked by the charge of a squadron under Major Mahon.\r\n\r\nBoth gunboats, having watched the Camel Corps safely into the zeriba,\r\nnow returned with the current and renewed their attack upon the Arabs.\r\nOpening a heavy and accurate fire upon the river flank, they drove them\r\nwestward and away from the Nile. Through the gap thus opened Broadwood\r\nand his squadrons trotted to rejoin the main body, picking up on the way\r\nthe two guns which had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing on the northern flank, the frontal\r\nattack was in progress. The debris of the 'White Flags' joined the\r\ncentre, and the whole 14,000 pressed forward against the zeriba,\r\nspreading out by degrees and abandoning their dense formations, and\r\ngradually slowing down. At about 800 yards from the British division the\r\nadvance ceased, and they could make no headway. Opposite the Soudanese,\r\nwho were armed only with the Martini-Henry rifle, the assailants came\r\nwithin 300 yards; and one brave old man, carrying a flag, fell at 150\r\npaces from the shelter trench. But the result was conclusive all along\r\nthe line. The attack was shattered. The leader, clad in his new jibba\r\nof many colours, rode on steadfastly towards the inexorable firing line,\r\nuntil, pierced by several bullets, he fell lifeless. Such was the end of\r\nthat stubborn warrior of many fights--wicked Osman Azrak, faithful\r\nunto death. The surviving Dervishes lay down on the ground. Unable\r\nto advance, they were unwilling to retire; and their riflemen, taking\r\nadvantage of the folds of the plain, opened and maintained an unequal\r\ncombat. By eight o'clock it was evident that the whole attack had\r\nfailed. The loss of the enemy was more than 2,000 killed, and perhaps as\r\nmany wounded. To the infantry, who were busy with their rifles, it had\r\nscarcely seemed a fight. Yet all along the front bullets had whizzed\r\nover and into the ranks, and in every battalion there were casualties.\r\nCaptain Caldecott, of the Warwicks, was killed; the Camerons had two\r\nofficers, Captain Clarke and Lieutenant Nicholson, severely wounded; the\r\nGrenadiers one, Captain Bagot. Colonel F. Rhodes, as he sat on his horse\r\nnear the Maxim battery of the 1st British Brigade, was shot through\r\nthe shoulder and carried from the field just as the attack reached its\r\nclimax. There were, besides these officers, about 150 casualties among\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe attack languished. The enemy's rifle fire continued, and as soon as\r\nthe heavy firing ceased it began to be annoying. The ground, although it\r\nappeared flat and level to the eye, nevertheless contained depressions\r\nand swellings which afforded good cover to the sharpshooters, and the\r\nsolid line behind the zeriba was an easy target. The artillery now began\r\nto clear out these depressions by their shells, and in this work they\r\ndisplayed a searching power very remarkable when their flat trajectory\r\nis remembered. As the shells burst accurately above the Dervish\r\nskirmishers and spearmen who were taking refuge in the folds of the\r\nplain, they rose by hundreds and by fifties to fly. Instantly the hungry\r\nand attentive Maxims and the watchful infantry opened on them, sweeping\r\nthem all to the ground--some in death, others in terror. Again the\r\nshells followed them to their new concealment. Again they rose, fewer\r\nthan before, and ran. Again the Maxims and the rifles spluttered.\r\nAgain they fell. And so on until the front of the zeriba was clear\r\nof unwounded men for at least half a mile. A few escaped. Some,\r\nnotwithstanding the vices of which they have been accused and the perils\r\nwith which they were encompassed, gloriously carried off their injured\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nAfter the attack had been broken, and while the front of the zeriba\r\nwas being cleared of the Dervish riflemen, the 21st Lancers were again\r\ncalled upon to act. The Sirdar and his generals were all agreed on one\r\npoint. They must occupy Omdurman before the Dervish army could get back\r\nthere. They could fight as many Dervishes as cared to come in the plain;\r\namong the houses it was different. As the Khalifa had anticipated, the\r\ninfidels, exulting in their victory, were eager, though for a different\r\nreason, to seize the city. And this they were now in a position to do.\r\nThe Arabs were out in the desert. A great part of their army was even as\r\nfar away as Kerreri. The troops could move on interior lines. They were\r\nbound to reach Omdurman first. The order was therefore given to march on\r\nthe city at once. But first the Surgham ridge must be reconnoitred,\r\nand the ground between the zeriba and Omdurman cleared of the\r\nDervishes--with infantry if necessary, but with cavalry if possible,\r\nbecause that would be quicker.\r\n\r\nAs the fusillade slackened, the Lancers stood to their horses. Then\r\nGeneral Gatacre, with Captain Brooke and the rest of his Staff, came\r\ngalloping along the rear of the line of infantry and guns, and shouted\r\nfor Colonel Martin. There was a brief conversation--an outstretched arm\r\npointing at the ridge--an order, and we were all scrambling into our\r\nsaddles and straightening the ranks in high expectation. We started at\r\na trot, two or three patrols galloping out in front, towards the high\r\nground, while the regiment followed in mass--a great square block\r\nof ungainly brown figures and little horses, hung all over with\r\nwater-bottles, saddle-bags, picketing-gear, tins of bully-beef, all\r\njolting and jangling together; the polish of peace gone; soldiers\r\nwithout glitter; horsemen without grace; but still a regiment of light\r\ncavalry in active operation against the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the ridge was only half a mile away. It was found\r\nunoccupied. The rocky mass of Surgham obstructed the view and concealed\r\nthe great reserve collected around the Black Flag. But southward,\r\nbetween us and Omdurman, the whole plain was exposed. It was infested\r\nwith small parties of Dervishes, moving about, mounted and on foot,\r\nin tens and twenties. Three miles away a broad stream of fugitives, of\r\nwounded, and of deserters flowed from the Khalifa's army to the city.\r\nThe mirages blurred and distorted the picture, so that some of the\r\nrouted Arabs walked in air and some through water, and all were\r\nmisty and unreal. But the sight was sufficient to excite the fiercest\r\ninstincts of cavalry. Only the scattered parties in the plain appeared\r\nto prevent a glorious pursuit. The signalling officer was set to\r\nheliograph back to the Sirdar that the ridge was unoccupied and that\r\nseveral thousand Dervishes could be seen flying into Omdurman. Pending\r\nthe answer, we waited; and looking back northwards, across the front\r\nof the zeriba, where the first attack had been stopped, perceived\r\na greyish-white smudge, perhaps a mile long. The glass disclosed\r\ndetails--hundreds of tiny white figures heaped or scattered; dozens\r\nhopping, crawling, staggering away; a few horses standing stolidly\r\namong the corpses; a few unwounded men dragging off their comrades.\r\nThe skirmishers among the rocks of Surgham soon began to fire at the\r\nregiment, and we sheltered among the mounds of sand, while a couple of\r\ntroops replied with their carbines. Then the heliograph in the zeriba\r\nbegan to talk in flashes of light that opened and shut capriciously.\r\nThe actual order is important. 'Advance,' said the helio, 'and clear\r\nthe left flank, and use every effort to prevent the enemy re-entering\r\nOmdurman.' That was all, but it was sufficient. In the distance the\r\nenemy could be seen re-entering Omdurman in hundreds. There was no room\r\nfor doubt. They must be stopped, and incidentally these small parties in\r\nthe plain might be brushed away. We remounted; the ground looked smooth\r\nand unbroken; yet it was desirable to reconnoitre. Two patrols were\r\nsent out. The small parties of Dervishes who were scattered all over the\r\nplain and the slopes of the hill prevented anything less than a squadron\r\nmoving, except at their peril. The first patrol struck out towards\r\nOmdurman, and began to push in between the scattered Dervishes, who\r\nfired their rifles and showed great excitement. The other patrol, under\r\nLieutenant Grenfell, were sent to see what the ground looked like from\r\nfurther along the ridge and on the lower slopes of Surgham. The riflemen\r\namong the rocks turned their fire from the regiment to these nearer\r\nobjects. The five brown figures cantered over the rough ground,\r\npresenting difficult targets, but under continual fire, and disappeared\r\nround the spur. However, in two or three minutes they re-appeared, the\r\nriflemen on the hill making a regular rattle of musketry, amid which the\r\nLancers galloped safely back, followed last of all by their officer. He\r\nsaid that the plain looked as safe from the other side of the hill as\r\nfrom where we were. At this moment the other patrol returned. They, too,\r\nhad had good fortune in their adventurous ride. Their information was\r\nexact. They reported that in a shallow and apparently practicable\r\nkhor about three-quarters of a mile to the south-west, and between\r\nthe regiment and the fugitives, there was drawn up a formed body of\r\nDervishes about 1,000 strong. Colonel Martin decided on this information\r\nto advance and attack this force, which alone interposed between him and\r\nthe Arab line of retreat. Then we started.\r\n\r\nBut all this time the enemy had been busy. At the beginning of the\r\nbattle the Khalifa had posted a small force of 700 men on his extreme\r\nright, to prevent his line of retreat to Omdurman being harassed. This\r\ndetachment was composed entirely of the Hadendoa tribesmen of Osman\r\nDigna's flag, and was commanded by one of his subordinate Emirs, who\r\nselected a suitable position in the shallow khor. As soon as the 21st\r\nLancers left the zeriba the Dervish scouts on the top of Surgham carried\r\nthe news to the Khalifa. It was said that the English cavalry were\r\ncoming to cut him off from Omdurman. Abdullah thereupon determined to\r\nstrengthen his extreme right; and he immediately ordered four regiments,\r\neach 500 strong, drawn from the force around the Black Flag and under\r\nthe Emir Ibrahim Khalil, to reinforce the Hadendoa in the khor. While we\r\nwere waiting for orders on the ridge these men were hurrying southwards\r\nalong the depression, and concealed by a spur of Surgham Hill. The\r\nLancer patrol reconnoitred the khor, at the imminent risk of their\r\nlives, while it was only occupied by the original 700 Hadendoa.\r\nGalloping back, they reported that it was held by about 1,000 men.\r\nBefore they reached the regiment this number was increased to 2,700.\r\nThis, however, we had no means of knowing. The Khalifa, having\r\ndespatched his reinforcement, rode on his donkey with a scanty escort\r\nnearly half a mile from the Black Flag towards the khor, in order to\r\nwatch the event, and in consequence he was within 500 yards of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nAs the 21st Lancers left the ridge, the fire of the Arab riflemen on\r\nthe hill ceased. We advanced at a walk in mass for about 300 yards. The\r\nscattered parties of Dervishes fell back and melted away, and only one\r\nstraggling line of men in dark blue waited motionless a quarter of\r\na mile to the left front. They were scarcely a hundred strong. The\r\nregiment formed into line of squadron columns, and continued at a walk\r\nuntil within 300 yards of this small body of Dervishes. The firing\r\nbehind the ridges had stopped. There was complete silence, intensified\r\nby the recent tumult. Far beyond the thin blue row of Dervishes the\r\nfugitives were visible streaming into Omdurman. And should these few\r\ndevoted men impede a regiment? Yet it were wiser to examine their\r\nposition from the other flank before slipping a squadron at them. The\r\nheads of the squadrons wheeled slowly to the left, and the Lancers,\r\nbreaking into a trot, began to cross the Dervish front in column of\r\ntroops. Thereupon and with one accord the blue-clad men dropped on their\r\nknees, and there burst out a loud, crackling fire of musketry. It was\r\nhardly possible to miss such a target at such a range. Horses and men\r\nfell at once. The only course was plain and welcome to all. The Colonel,\r\nnearer than his regiment, already saw what lay behind the skirmishers.\r\nHe ordered, 'Right wheel into line' to be sounded. The trumpet jerked\r\nout a shrill note, heard faintly above the trampling of the horses and\r\nthe noise of the rifles. On the instant all the sixteen troops swung\r\nround and locked up into a long galloping line, and the 21st Lancers\r\nwere committed to their first charge in war.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty yards away the dark-blue men were firing madly in\r\na thin film of light-blue smoke. Their bullets struck the hard gravel\r\ninto the air, and the troopers, to shield their faces from the stinging\r\ndust, bowed their helmets forward, like the Cuirassiers at Waterloo. The\r\npace was fast and the distance short. Yet, before it was half covered,\r\nthe whole aspect of the affair changed. A deep crease in the ground--a\r\ndry watercourse, a khor--appeared where all had seemed smooth, level\r\nplain; and from it there sprang, with the suddenness of a pantomime\r\neffect and a high-pitched yell, a dense white mass of men nearly as\r\nlong as our front and about twelve deep. A score of horsemen and a dozen\r\nbright flags rose as if by magic from the earth. Eager warriors sprang\r\nforward to anticipate the shock. The rest stood firm to meet it. The\r\nLancers acknowledged the apparition only by an increase of pace. Each\r\nman wanted sufficient momentum to drive through such a solid line. The\r\nflank troops, seeing that they overlapped, curved inwards like the horns\r\nof a moon. But the whole event was a matter of seconds. The riflemen,\r\nfiring bravely to the last, were swept head over heels into the khor,\r\nand jumping down with them, at full gallop and in the closest order, the\r\nBritish squadrons struck the fierce brigade with one loud furious shout.\r\nThe collision was prodigious. Nearly thirty Lancers, men and horses, and\r\nat least two hundred Arabs were overthrown. The shock was stunning to\r\nboth sides, and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds no man heeded his\r\nenemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men,\r\nsprawling in heaps, struggled, dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted,\r\nand looked about them. Several fallen Lancers had even time to re-mount.\r\nMeanwhile the impetus of the cavalry carried them on. As a rider tears\r\nthrough a bullfinch, the officers forced their way through the press;\r\nand as an iron rake might be drawn through a heap of shingle, so the\r\nregiment followed. They shattered the Dervish array, and, their pace\r\nreduced to a walk, scrambled out of the khor on the further side,\r\nleaving a score of troopers behind them, and dragging on with the charge\r\nmore than a thousand Arabs. Then, and not till then, the killing began;\r\nand thereafter each man saw the world along his lance, under his guard,\r\nor through the back-sight of his pistol; and each had his own strange\r\ntale to tell.\r\n\r\nStubborn and unshaken infantry hardly ever meet stubborn and unshaken\r\ncavalry. Either the infantry run away and are cut down in flight, or\r\nthey keep their heads and destroy nearly all the horsemen by their\r\nmusketry. On this occasion two living walls had actually crashed\r\ntogether. The Dervishes fought manfully. They tried to hamstring the\r\nhorses, They fired their rifles, pressing the muzzles into the very\r\nbodies of their opponents. They cut reins and stirrup-leathers. They\r\nflung their throwing-spears with great dexterity. They tried every\r\ndevice of cool, determined men practised in war and familiar with\r\ncavalry; and, besides, they swung sharp, heavy swords which bit deep.\r\nThe hand-to-hand fighting on the further side of the khor lasted for\r\nperhaps one minute. Then the horses got into their stride again, the\r\npace increased, and the Lancers drew out from among their antagonists.\r\nWithin two minutes of the collision every living man was clear of the\r\nDervish mass. All who had fallen were cut at with swords till they\r\nstopped quivering, but no artistic mutilations were attempted.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards away the regiment halted, rallied, faced about, and in\r\nless than five minutes were re-formed and ready for a second charge. The\r\nmen were anxious to cut their way back through their enemies. We were\r\nalone together--the cavalry regiment and the Dervish brigade. The ridge\r\nhung like a curtain between us and the army. The general battle was\r\nforgotten, as it was unseen. This was a private quarrel. The other might\r\nhave been a massacre; but here the fight was fair, for we too fought\r\nwith sword and spear. Indeed the advantage of ground and numbers lay\r\nwith them. All prepared to settle the debate at once and for ever. But\r\nsome realisation of the cost of our wild ride began to come to those\r\nwho were responsible. Riderless horses galloped across the plain. Men,\r\nclinging to their saddles, lurched helplessly about, covered with blood\r\nfrom perhaps a dozen wounds. Horses, streaming from tremendous gashes,\r\nlimped and staggered with their riders. In 120 seconds five officers, 65\r\nmen, and 119 horses out of fewer than 400 had been killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish line, broken by the charge, began to re-form at once. They\r\nclosed up, shook themselves together, and prepared with constancy\r\nand courage for another shock. But on military considerations it was\r\ndesirable to turn them out of the khor first and thus deprive them of\r\ntheir vantage ground. The regiment again drawn up, three squadrons in\r\nline and the fourth in column, now wheeled to the right, and, galloping\r\nround the Dervish flank, dismounted and opened a heavy fire with their\r\nmagazine carbines. Under the pressure of this fire the enemy changed\r\nfront to meet the new attack, so that both sides were formed at right\r\nangles to their original lines. When the Dervish change of front was\r\ncompleted, they began to advance against the dismounted men. But the\r\nfire was accurate, and there can be little doubt that the moral effect\r\nof the charge had been very great, and that these brave enemies were no\r\nlonger unshaken. Be this as it may, the fact remains that they retreated\r\nswiftly, though in good order, towards the ridge of Surgham Hill, where\r\nthe Khalifa's Black Flag still waved, and the 21st Lancers remained in\r\npossession of the ground--and of their dead.\r\n\r\nSuch is the true and literal account of the charge; but the reader\r\nmay care to consider a few incidents. Colonel Martin, busy with the\r\ndirection of his regiment, drew neither sword nor revolver, and rode\r\nthrough the press unarmed and uninjured. Major Crole Wyndham had his\r\nhorse shot under him by a Dervish who pressed the muzzle of his rifle\r\ninto its hide before firing. From out of the middle of that savage crowd\r\nthe officer fought his way on foot and escaped in safety. Lieutenant\r\nMolyneux fell in the khor into the midst of the enemy. In the confusion\r\nhe disentangled himself from his horse, drew his revolver, and jumped\r\nout of the hollow before the Dervishes recoved from the impact of the\r\ncharge. Then they attacked him. He fired at the nearest, and at the\r\nmoment of firing was slashed across the right wrist by another. The\r\npistol fell from his nerveless hand, and, being wounded, dismounted, and\r\ndisarmed, he turned in the hopes of regaining, by following the line of\r\nthe charge, his squadron, which was just getting clear. Hard upon his\r\ntrack came the enemy, eager to make an end. Beset on all sides, and\r\nthus hotly pursued, the wounded officer perceived a single Lancer riding\r\nacross his path. He called on him for help. Whereupon the trooper,\r\nPrivate Byrne, although already severely wounded by a bullet which had\r\npenetrated his right arm, replied without a moment's hesitation and in a\r\ncheery voice, 'All right, sir!' and turning, rode at four Dervishes who\r\nwere about to kill his officer. His wound, which had partly paralysed\r\nhis arm, prevented him from grasping his sword, and at the first\r\nineffectual blow it fell from his hand, and he received another wound\r\nfrom a spear in the chest. But his solitary charge had checked the\r\npursuing Dervishes. Lieutenant Molyneux regained his squadron alive, and\r\nthe trooper, seeing that his object was attained, galloped away, reeling\r\nin his saddle. Arrived at his troop, his desperate condition was noticed\r\nand he was told to fall out. But this he refused to do, urging that he\r\nwas entitled to remain on duty and have 'another go at them.' At length\r\nhe was compelled to leave the field, fainting from loss of blood.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Nesham had an even more extraordinary escape than Molyneux.\r\nHe had scrambled out of the khor when, as his horse was nearly stopping,\r\nan Arab seized his bridle. He struck at the man with his sword, but\r\ndid not prevent him cutting his off-rein. The officer's bridle-hand,\r\nunexpectedly released, flew out, and, as it did so, a swordsman at a\r\nsingle stroke nearly severed it from his body. Then they cut at him\r\nfrom all sides. One blow sheared through his helmet and grazed his head.\r\nAnother inflicted a deep wound in his right leg. A third, intercepted\r\nby his shoulder-chains, paralysed his right arm. Two more, missing\r\nhim narrowly, cut right through the cantel of the saddle and into the\r\nhorse's back. The wounded subaltern--he was the youngest of all--reeled.\r\nA man on either side seized his legs to pull him to the ground; but\r\nthe long spurs stuck into the horse's flanks, and the maddened animal,\r\nthrowing up its head and springing forward, broke away from the crowd\r\nof foes, and carried the rider--bleeding, fainting, but still alive--to\r\nsafety among the rallying squadrons. Lieutenant Nesham's experience was\r\nthat of the men who were killed, only that he escaped to describe it.\r\n\r\nThe wounded were sent with a small escort towards the river and\r\nhospitals. An officer was despatched with the news to the Sirdar, and\r\non the instant both cannonade and fusillade broke out again behind the\r\nridge, and grew in a crashing crescendo until the whole landscape seemed\r\nto vibrate with the sound of explosions. The second phase of the battle\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nEven before the 21st Lancers had reconnoitred Surgham ridge, the Sirdar\r\nhad set his brigades in motion towards Omdurman. He was determined, even\r\nat a very great risk, to occupy the city while it was empty and before\r\nthe army in the plain could return to defend it. The advantage might be\r\ntremendous. Nevertheless the movement was premature. The Khalifa still\r\nremained undefeated west of Surgham Hill; Ali-Wad-Helu lurked behind\r\nKerreri; Osman was rapidly re-forming. There were still at least 35,000\r\nmen on the field. Nor, as the event proved, was it possible to enter\r\nOmdurman until they had been beaten.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the infantry had replenished their ammunition, they wheeled\r\nto the left in echelon of brigades, and began to march towards Surgham\r\nridge. The movements of a great force are slow. It was not desirable\r\nthat the British division, which led the echelon, should remain in the\r\nlow ground north of Surgham--where they were commanded, had no field of\r\nfire, and could see nothing--and accordingly both these brigades moved\r\nforward almost together to occupy the crest of the ridge. Thus two steps\r\nof the ladder were run into one, and Maxwell's brigade, which followed\r\nWauchope's, was 600 yards further south than it would have been had the\r\nregular echelon been observed. In the zeriba MacDonald had been next\r\nto Maxwell. But a very significant change in the order was now made.\r\nGeneral Hunter evidently conceived the rear of the echelon threatened\r\nfrom the direction of Kerreri. Had the earth swallowed all the thousands\r\nwho had moved across the plain towards the hills? At any rate, he would\r\nhave his best brigade and his most experienced general in the post of\r\npossible danger. He therefore ordered Lewis's brigade to follow Maxwell,\r\nand left MacDonald last of all, strengthening him with three batteries\r\nof artillery and eight Maxim guns. Collinson marched with the transport.\r\nMacDonald moved out westward into the desert to take his place in the\r\nechelon, and also to allow Lewis to pass him as ordered. Lewis hurried\r\non after Maxwell, and, taking his distance from him, was thus also 600\r\nyards further south than the regular echelon admitted. The step\r\nwhich had been absorbed when both British brigades moved\r\noff--advisedly--together, caused a double gap between MacDonald and the\r\nrest of the army. And this distance was further increased by the fact\r\nthat while he was moving west, to assume his place in correct echelon,\r\nthe other five brigades were drawing off to the southward. Hence\r\nMacDonald's isolation.\r\n\r\nAt 9.15 the whole army was marching south in echelon, with the rear\r\nbrigade at rather more than double distance. Collinson had already\r\nstarted with the transport, but the field hospitals still remained in\r\nthe deserted zeriba, busily packing up. The medical staff had about 150\r\nwounded on their hands. The Sirdar's orders had been that these were to\r\nbe placed on the hospital barges, and that the field hospitals were to\r\nfollow the transport. But the moving of wounded men is a painful and\r\ndelicate affair, and by a stupid and grievous mistake the three regular\r\nhospital barges, duly prepared for the reception of the wounded, had\r\nbeen towed across to the right bank. It was necessary to use three\r\nammunition barges, which, although in no way arranged for the reception\r\nof wounded, were luckily at hand. Meanwhile time was passing, and the\r\ndoctors, who worked with devoted energy, became suddenly aware that,\r\nwith the exception of a few detachments from the British division and\r\nthree Egyptian companies, there were no troops within half a mile, and\r\nnone between them and the dark Kerreri Hills. The two gunboats which\r\ncould have guarded them from the river were down stream, helping the\r\ncavalry; MacDonald with the rear brigade was out in the plain; Collinson\r\nwas hurrying along the bank with his transport. They were alone and\r\nunprotected. The army and the river together formed a huge \"V\" pointing\r\nsouth. The northern extremity--the gorge of the redan, as it were--gaped\r\nopen towards Kerreri; and from Kerreri there now began to come, like the\r\nfirst warning drops before a storm of rain, small straggling parties of\r\nDervish cavalry. The interior of the \"V\" was soon actually invaded by\r\nthese predatory patrols, and one troop of perhaps a score of Baggara\r\nhorse watered their ponies within 300 yards of the unprotected\r\nhospitals. Behind, in the distance, the banners of an army began to\r\nre-appear. The situation was alarming. The wounded were bundled on to\r\nthe barges, although, since there was no steamer to tow them, they were\r\nscarcely any safer when embarked. While some of the medical officers\r\nwere thus busied, Colonel Sloggett galloped off, and, running the\r\ngauntlet of the Baggara horsemen, hurried to claim protection for the\r\nhospitals and their helpless occupants. In the midst of this excitement\r\nand confusion the wounded from the cavalry charge began to trickle in.\r\n\r\nWhen the British division had moved out of the zeriba, a few skirmishers\r\namong the crags of Surgham Hill alone suggested the presence of an\r\nenemy. Each brigade, formed in four parallel columns of route, which\r\nclosed in until they were scarcely forty paces apart, and both at\r\ndeploying interval--the second brigade nearer the river, the first\r\nalmost in line with it and on its right--hurried on, eager to see what\r\nlay beyond the ridge. All was quiet, except for a few 'sniping' shots\r\nfrom the top of Surgham. But gradually as Maxwell's brigade--the third\r\nin the echelon--approached the hill, these shots became more numerous,\r\nuntil the summit of the peak was spotted with smoke-puffs. The British\r\ndivision moved on steadily, and, leaving these bold skirmishers to the\r\nSoudanese, soon reached the crest of the ridge. At once and for the\r\nfirst time the whole panorama of Omdurman--the brown and battered dome\r\nof the Mahdi's Tomb, the multitude of mud houses, the glittering fork of\r\nwater which marked the confluence of the rivers--burst on their vision.\r\nFor a moment they stared entranced. Then their attention was distracted;\r\nfor trotting, galloping, or halting and gazing stupidly about them,\r\nterrified and bewildered, a dozen riderless troop-horses appeared over\r\nthe further crest--for the ridge was flat-topped--coming from the plain,\r\nas yet invisible, below. It was the first news of the Lancers' charge.\r\nDetails soon followed in the shape of the wounded, who in twos and\r\nthrees began to make their way between the battalions, all covered with\r\nblood and many displaying most terrible injuries--faces cut to\r\nrags, bowels protruding, fishhook spears still stuck in their\r\nbodies--realistic pictures from the darker side of war. Thus absorbed,\r\nthe soldiers hardly noticed the growing musketry fire from the peak.\r\nBut suddenly the bang of a field-gun set all eyes looking backward. A\r\nbattery had unlimbered in the plain between the zeriba and the ridge,\r\nand was beginning to shell the summit of the hill. The report of the\r\nguns seemed to be the signal for the whole battle to reopen. From far\r\naway to the right rear there came the sound of loud and continuous\r\ninfantry firing, and immediately Gatacre halted his division.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the British had topped the crest of the ridge, before\r\nthe battery had opened from the plain, while Colonel Sloggett was still\r\nspurring across the dangerous ground between the river and the army,\r\nthe Sirdar knew that his enemy was again upon him. Looking back from\r\nthe slopes of Surgham, he saw that MacDonald, instead of continuing his\r\nmarch in echelon, had halted and deployed. The veteran brigadier\r\nhad seen the Dervish formations on the ridge to the west of Surgham,\r\nrealised that he was about to be attacked, and, resolving to anticipate\r\nthe enemy, immediately brought his three batteries into action at 1,200\r\nyards, Five minutes later the whole of the Khalifa's reserve, 15,000\r\nstrong, led by Yakub with the Black Flag, the bodyguard and 'all the\r\nglories' of the Dervish Empire, surged into view from behind the hill\r\nand advanced on the solitary brigade with the vigour of the first attack\r\nand thrice its chances of success. Thereupon Sir Herbert Kitchener\r\nordered Maxwell to change front to the right and storm Surgham Hill.\r\nHe sent Major Sandbach to tell Lewis to conform and come into\r\nline on Maxwell's right. He galloped himself to the British\r\ndivision--conveniently halted by General Gatacre on the northern crest\r\nof the ridge--and ordered Lyttelton with the 2nd Brigade to form facing\r\nwest on Maxwell's left south of Surgham, and Wauchope with the 1st\r\nBrigade to hurry back to fill the wide gap between Lewis and MacDonald.\r\nLast of all he sent an officer to Collinson and the Camel Corps with\r\norders that they should swing round to their right rear and close the\r\nopen part of the \"V\". By these movements the army, instead of facing\r\nsouth in echelon, with its left on the river and its right in the\r\ndesert, was made to face west in line, with its left in the desert and\r\nits right reaching back to the river. It had turned nearly a complete\r\nsomersault.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to these orders Lyttelton's brigade brought up their left\r\nshoulders, deployed into line, and advanced west; Maxwell's Soudanese\r\nscrambled up the Surgham rocks, and, in spite of a sharp fire, cleared\r\nthe peak with the bayonet and pressed on down the further side; Lewis\r\nbegan to come into action on Maxwell's right; MacDonald, against whom\r\nthe Khalifa's attack was at first entirely directed, remained facing\r\nsouth-west, and was soon shrouded in the smoke of his own musketry and\r\nartillery fire. The three brigades which were now moving west and\r\naway from the Nile attacked the right flank of the Dervishes assailing\r\nMacDonald, and, compelling them to form front towards the river,\r\nundoubtedly took much of the weight of the attack off the isolated\r\nbrigade. There remained the gap between Lewis and MacDonald. But\r\nWauchope's brigade--still in four parallel columns of route--had\r\nshouldered completely round to the north, and was now doubling swiftly\r\nacross the plain to fill the unguarded space. With the exception of\r\nWauchope's brigade and of Collinson's Egyptians, the whole infantry and\r\nartillery force were at once furiously engaged.\r\n\r\nThe firing became again tremendous, and the sound was even louder than\r\nduring the attack on the zeriba. As each fresh battalion was brought\r\ninto line the tumult steadily increased. The three leading brigades\r\ncontinued to advance westward in one long line looped up over Surgham\r\nHill, and with the right battalion held back in column. As the forces\r\ngradually drew nearer, the possibility of the Dervishes penetrating\r\nthe gap between Lewis and MacDonald presented itself, and the flank\r\nbattalion was wheeled into line so as to protect the right flank.\r\nThe aspect of the Dervish attack was at this moment most formidable.\r\nEnormous masses of men were hurrying towards the smoke-clouds that\r\nalmost hid MacDonald. Other masses turned to meet the attack which was\r\ndeveloping on their right. Within the angle formed by the three brigades\r\nfacing west and MacDonald facing nearly south a great army of not fewer\r\nthan 15,000 men was enclosed, like a flock of sheep in a fold, by\r\nthe thin brown lines of the British and Egyptian brigades. As the 7th\r\nEgyptians, the right battalion of Lewis's brigade and nearest the gap\r\nbetween that unit and MacDonald, deployed to protect the flank, they\r\nbecame unsteady, began to bunch and waver, and actually made several\r\nretrograde movements. There was a moment of danger; but General Hunter,\r\nwho was on the spot, himself ordered the two reserve companies of the\r\n15th Egyptians under Major Hickman to march up behind them with fixed\r\nbayonets. Their morale was thus restored and the peril averted. The\r\nadvance of the three brigades continued.\r\n\r\nYakub found himself utterly unable to withstand the attack from\r\nthe river. His own attack on MacDonald languished. The musketry was\r\nproducing terrible losses in his crowded ranks. The valiant Wad Bishara\r\nand many other less famous Emirs fell dead. Gradually he began to give\r\nground. It was evident that the civilised troops were the stronger. But\r\neven before the attack was repulsed, the Khalifa, who watched from\r\na close position, must have known that the day was lost; for when\r\nhe launched Yakub at MacDonald, it was clear that the only chance of\r\nsuccess depended on Ali-Wad-Helu and Osman Sheikh-ed-Din attacking at\r\nthe same time from Kerreri. And with bitter rage and mortification\r\nhe perceived that, although the banners were now gathering under the\r\nKerreri Hills, Ali and Osman were too late, and the attacks which\r\nshould have been simultaneous would only be consecutive. The effect\r\nof Broadwood's cavalry action upon the extreme right was now becoming\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nRegrets and fury were alike futile. The three brigades advancing drove\r\nthe Khalifa's Dervishes back into the desert. Along a mile of front an\r\nintense and destructive fire flared and crackled. The 32nd British Field\r\nBattery on the extreme left was drawn by its hardy mules at full gallop\r\ninto action. The Maxim guns pulsated feverishly. Two were even dragged\r\nby the enterprise of a subaltern to the very summit of Surgham, and from\r\nthis elevated position intervened with bloody effect. Thus the long line\r\nmoved forward in irresistible strength. In the centre, under the red\r\nEgyptian flag, careless of the bullets which that conspicuous emblem\r\ndrew, and which inflicted some loss among those around him, rode the\r\nSirdar, stern and sullen, equally unmoved by fear or enthusiasm. A mile\r\naway to the rear the gunboats, irritated that the fight was passing\r\nbeyond their reach, steamed restlessly up and down, like caged Polar\r\nbears seeking what they might devour. Before that terrible line the\r\nKhalifa's division began to break up. The whole ground was strewn with\r\ndead and wounded, among whose bodies the soldiers picked their steps\r\nwith the customary Soudan precautions. Surviving thousands struggled\r\naway towards Omdurman and swelled the broad stream of fugitives upon\r\nwhose flank the 21st Lancers already hung vengefully. Yakub and the\r\ndefenders of the Black Flag disdained to fly, and perished where they\r\nstood, beneath the holy ensign, so that when their conquerors reached\r\nthe spot the dark folds of the banner waved only over the dead.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was taking place--for events were moving at speed--the\r\n1st British Brigade were still doubling across the rear of Maxwell and\r\nLewis to fill the gap between the latter and MacDonald. As they had\r\nwheeled round, the regiments gained on each other according to their\r\nproximity to the pivot flank. The brigade assumed a formation which may\r\nbe described as an echelon of columns of route, with the Lincolns, who\r\nwere actually the pivot regiment, leading. By the time that the right of\r\nLewis's brigade was reached and the British had begun to deploy, it was\r\nevident that the Khalifa's attack was broken and that his force was in\r\nfull retreat. In the near foreground the Arab dead lay thick. Crowds of\r\nfugitives were trooping off in the distance. The Black Flag alone waved\r\ndefiantly over the corpses of its defenders. In the front of the\r\nbrigade the fight was over. But those who looked away to the right saw a\r\ndifferent spectacle. What appeared to be an entirely new army was coming\r\ndown from the Kerreri Hills. While the soldiers looked and wondered,\r\nfresh orders arrived. A mounted officer galloped up. There was a\r\nreport that terrible events were happening in the dust and smoke to\r\nthe northward. The spearmen had closed with MacDonald's brigade; were\r\ncrumpling his line from the flank; had already broken it. Such were\r\nthe rumours. The orders were more precise. The nearest regiment--the\r\nLincolnshire--was to hurry to MacDonald's threatened flank to meet the\r\nattack. The rest of the brigade was to change front half right, and\r\nremain in support. The Lincolnshires, breathless but elated, forthwith\r\nstarted off again at the double. They began to traverse the rear\r\nof MacDonald's brigade, dimly conscious of rapid movements by its\r\nbattalions, and to the sound of tremendous independent firing, which did\r\nnot, however, prevent them from hearing the venomous hiss of bullets.\r\n\r\nHad the Khalifa's attack been simultaneous with that which was now\r\ndeveloped, the position of MacDonald's brigade must have been almost\r\nhopeless. In the actual event it was one of extreme peril. The attack in\r\nhis front was weakening every minute, but the far more formidable\r\nattack on his right rear grew stronger and nearer in inverse ratio.\r\nBoth attacks must be met. The moment was critical; the danger near. All\r\ndepended on MacDonald, and that officer, who by valour and conduct in\r\nwar had won his way from the rank of a private soldier to the command of\r\na brigade, and will doubtless obtain still higher employment, was equal\r\nto the emergency.\r\n\r\nTo meet the Khalifa's attack he had arranged his force facing\r\nsouth-west, with three battalions in line and the fourth held back in\r\ncolumn of companies in rear of the right flank--an inverted L-shaped\r\nformation. As the attack from the south-west gradually weakened and\r\nthe attack from the north-west continually increased, he broke off his\r\nbattalions and batteries from the longer side of the L and transferred\r\nthem to the shorter. He timed these movements so accurately that each\r\nface of his brigade was able to exactly sustain the attacks of the\r\nenemy. As soon as the Khalifa's force began to waver he ordered the XIth\r\nSoudanese and a battery on his left to move across the angle in which\r\nthe brigade was formed, and deploy along the shorter face to meet\r\nthe impending onslaught of Ali-Wad-Helu. Perceiving this, the IXth\r\nSoudanese, who were the regiment in column on the right of the original\r\nfront, wheeled to the right from column into line without waiting for\r\norders, so that two battalions faced towards the Khalifa and two\r\ntowards the fresh attack. By this time it was clear that the Khalifa\r\nwas practically repulsed, and MacDonald ordered the Xth Soudanese and\r\nanother battery to change front and prolong the line of the IXth and\r\nXIth. He then moved the 2nd Egyptians diagonally to their right front,\r\nso as to close the gap at the angle between their line and that of the\r\nthree other battalions. These difficult manœuvres were carried out\r\nunder a heavy fire, which in twenty minutes caused over 120 casualties\r\nin the four battalions--exclusive of the losses in the artillery\r\nbatteries--and in the face of the determined attacks of an enemy who\r\noutnumbered the troops by seven to one and had only to close with them\r\nto be victorious. Amid the roar of the firing and the dust, smoke, and\r\nconfusion of the change of front, the general found time to summon\r\nthe officers of the IXth Soudanese around him, rebuked them for having\r\nwheeled into line in anticipation of his order, and requested them to\r\ndrill more steadily in brigade.\r\n\r\nThe three Soudanese battalions were now confronted with the whole fury\r\nof the Dervish attack from Kerreri. The bravery of the blacks was no\r\nless conspicuous than the wildness of their musketry. They evinced an\r\nextraordinary excitement--firing their rifles without any attempt to\r\nsight or aim, and only anxious to pull the trigger, re-load, and pull\r\nit again. In vain the British officers strove to calm their impulsive\r\nsoldiers. In vain they called upon them by name, or, taking their rifles\r\nfrom them, adjusted the sights themselves. The independent firing was\r\nutterly beyond control. Soon the ammunition began to be exhausted, and\r\nthe soldiers turned round clamouring for more cartridges, which their\r\nofficers doled out to them by twos and threes in the hopes of steadying\r\nthem. It was useless. They fired them all off and clamoured for more.\r\nMeanwhile, although suffering fearfully from the close and accurate fire\r\nof the three artillery batteries and eight Maxim guns, and to a less\r\nextent from the random firing of the Soudanese, the Dervishes drew\r\nnearer in thousands, and it seemed certain that there would be an actual\r\ncollision. The valiant blacks prepared themselves with delight to\r\nmeet the shock, notwithstanding the overwhelming numbers of the enemy.\r\nScarcely three rounds per man remained throughout the brigade. The\r\nbatteries opened a rapid fire of case-shot. Still the Dervishes\r\nadvanced, and the survivors of their first wave of assault were scarcely\r\n100 yards away. Behind them both green flags pressed forward over\r\nenormous masses of armed humanity, rolling on as they now believed to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Lincoln Regiment began to come up. As soon as the\r\nleading company cleared the right of MacDonald's brigade, they formed\r\nline, and opened an independent fire obliquely across the front of the\r\nSoudanese. Groups of Dervishes in twos and threes were then within 100\r\nyards. The great masses were within 300 yards. The independent firing\r\nlasted two minutes, during which the whole regiment deployed. Its effect\r\nwas to clear away the leading groups of Arabs. The deployment having\r\nbeen accomplished with the loss of a dozen men, including Colonel\r\nSloggett, who fell shot through the breast while attending to the\r\nwounded, section volleys were ordered. With excellent discipline the\r\nindependent firing was instantly stopped, and the battalion began with\r\nmachine-like regularity to carry out the principles of modern musketry,\r\nfor which their training had efficiently prepared them and their rifles\r\nwere admirably suited. They fired on an average sixty rounds per man,\r\nand finally repulsed the attack.\r\n\r\nThe Dervishes were weak in cavalry, and had scarcely 2,000 horsemen\r\non the field. About 400 of these, mostly the personal retainers of the\r\nvarious Emirs, were formed into an irregular regiment and attached to\r\nthe flag of Ali-Wad-Helu. Now when these horsemen perceived that there\r\nwas no more hope of victory, they arranged themselves in a solid mass\r\nand charged the left of MacDonald's brigade. The distance was about 500\r\nyards, and, wild as was the firing of the Soudanese, it was evident that\r\nthey could not possibly succeed. Nevertheless, many carrying no weapon\r\nin their hands, and all urging their horses to their utmost speed, they\r\nrode unflinchingly to certain death. All were killed and fell as they\r\nentered the zone of fire--three, twenty, fifty, two hundred, sixty,\r\nthirty, five and one out beyond them all--a brown smear across the\r\nsandy plain. A few riderless horses alone broke through the ranks of the\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the attack from Kerreri the whole Anglo-Egyptian\r\narmy advanced westward, in a line of bayonets and artillery nearly two\r\nmiles long, and drove the Dervishes before them into the desert, so that\r\nthey could by no means rally or reform. The Egyptian cavalry, who had\r\nreturned along the river, formed line on the right of the infantry in\r\nreadiness to pursue. At half-past eleven Sir H. Kitchener shut up his\r\nglasses, and, remarking that he thought the enemy had been given 'a good\r\ndusting,' gave the order for the brigades to resume their interrupted\r\nmarch on Omdurman--a movement which was possible, now that the forces\r\nin the plain were beaten. The brigadiers thereupon stopped the firing,\r\nmassed their commands in convenient formations, and turned again towards\r\nthe south and the city. The Lincolnshire Regiment remained detached as a\r\nrearguard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great Dervish army, who had advanced at sunrise in hope\r\nand courage, fled in utter rout, pursued by the Egyptian cavalry,\r\nharried by the 21st Lancers, and leaving more than 9,000 warriors dead\r\nand even greater numbers wounded behind them.\r\n\r\nThus ended the battle of Omdurman--the most signal triumph ever gained\r\nby the arms of science over barbarians. Within the space of five hours\r\nthe strongest and best-armed savage army yet arrayed against a modern\r\nEuropean Power had been destroyed and dispersed, with hardly any\r\ndifficulty, comparatively small risk, and insignificant loss to the\r\nvictors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: THE FALL OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when the Khalifa Abdullah saw that the last army that remained to\r\nhim was broken, that all his attacks had failed, and that thousands of\r\nhis bravest warriors were slain, he rode from the field of battle in\r\nhaste, and, regaining the city, proceeded like a brave and stubborn\r\nsoldier to make preparations for its defence, and, like a prudent man,\r\nto arrange for his own flight should further resistance be impossible.\r\nHe ordered his great war-drum to be beaten and the ombya to be blown,\r\nand for the last time those dismal notes boomed through the streets of\r\nOmdurman. They were not heeded. The Arabs had had enough fighting.\r\nThey recognised that all was lost. Besides, to return to the city was\r\ndifficult and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe charge of the 21st Lancers had been costly, but it was not\r\nineffective. The consequent retirement of the Dervish brigade protecting\r\nthe extreme right exposed their line of retreat. The cavalry were\r\nresolved to take full advantage of the position they had paid so much\r\nto gain, and while the second attack was at its height we were already\r\ntrotting over the plain towards the long lines of fugitives who streamed\r\nacross it. With the experience of the past hour in our minds, and with\r\nthe great numbers of the enemy in our front, it seemed to many that\r\na bloody day lay before us. But we had not gone far when individual\r\nDervishes began to walk towards the advancing squadrons, throwing down\r\ntheir weapons, holding up their hands, and imploring mercy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was apparent that the surrender of individuals was\r\naccepted, the Dervishes began to come in and lay down their arms--at\r\nfirst by twos and threes, then by dozens, and finally by scores.\r\nMeanwhile those who were still intent on flight made a wide detour to\r\navoid the cavalry, and streamed past our front at a mile's distance in\r\nuninterrupted succession. The disarming and escorting of the prisoners\r\ndelayed our advance, and many thousands of Dervishes escaped from the\r\nfield. But the position of the cavalry and the pressure they exerted\r\nshouldered the routed army out into the desert, so that retiring they\r\nmissed the city of Omdurman altogether, and, disregarding the Khalifa's\r\nsummons to defend it and the orders of their Emirs; continued their\r\nflight to the south. To harry and annoy the fugitives a few troops were\r\ndismounted with carbines, and a constant fire was made on such as did\r\nnot attempt to come in and surrender. Yet the crowds continued to run\r\nthe gauntlet, and at least 20,000 men made good their escape. Many\r\nof these were still vicious, and replied to our fire with bullets,\r\nfortunately at very long range. It would have been madness for 300\r\nLancers to gallop in among such masses, and we had to be content with\r\nthe results of the carbine fire.\r\n\r\nWhile all this had been going on, the advance of the army on Omdurman\r\nwas continuing. Nor was it long before we saw the imposing array of\r\ninfantry topping the sandhills near Surgham and flooding out into the\r\nplain which lay between them and the city. High over the centre brigade\r\nflew the Black Flag of the Khalifa, and underneath a smaller flash of\r\nred marked the position of the Headquarters Staff. The black masses of\r\nmen continued to move slowly across the open ground while we fired at\r\nthe flying Arabs, and at twelve o'clock we saw them halt near the river\r\nabout three miles from the city. Orders now reached us to join them, and\r\nas the sun was hot, the day dragged, all were tired and hungry, and the\r\nhorses needed water, we were not long in complying, and the remnants of\r\nthe Dervish army made good their retreat unmolested.\r\n\r\nWe marched back to the Nile. The whole force had halted to drink, to\r\neat, and to rest at Khor Shambat. The scene was striking. Imagine a six\r\nhundred yards stretch of the Suez Canal. Both banks are crowded with\r\nbrown- or chocolate-clad figures. The northern side is completely\r\ncovered with the swarming infantry of the British division. Thousands of\r\nanimals--the horses of the cavalry, the artillery mules, the transport\r\ncamels--fill the spaces and the foreground. Multitudes of khaki-clad men\r\nare sitting in rows on the slopes. Hundreds are standing by the brim or\r\nactually in the red muddy water. All are drinking deeply. Two or three\r\ncarcasses, lying in the shallows, show that the soldiers are thirsty\r\nrather than particular. On all sides water-bottles are being filled from\r\nthe welcome Nile, which has come into the desert to refresh the weary\r\nanimals and men.\r\n\r\nDuring the attack on MacDonald's brigade the Egyptian cavalry had\r\nwatched from their position on the southern slopes of the Kerreri Hills,\r\nready to intervene, if necessary, and support the infantry by a charge.\r\nAs soon as the Dervish onsets had ended and the whole mass had begun to\r\nretreat, Broadwood's cavalry brigade formed in two lines, of four and of\r\nfive squadrons respectively, and advanced in pursuit--first west for two\r\nmiles, and then south-west for three miles more towards the Round-topped\r\nHill. Like the 21st Lancers, they were delayed by many Dcrvishes who\r\nthrew down their arms and surrendered, and whom it was necessary to\r\nescort to the river. But as they drew nearer the mass of the routed\r\narmy, it became apparent that the spirit of the enemy was by no means\r\nbroken. Stubborn men fired continually as they lay wounded, refusing\r\nto ask for quarter--doubting, perhaps, that it would be granted. Under\r\nevery bush that gave protection from the lances of the horsemen little\r\ngroups collected to make a desperate stand. Solitary spearmen awaited\r\nunflinching the charge of a whole squadron. Men who had feigned death\r\nsprang up to fire an unexpected shot. The cavalry began to suffer\r\noccasional casualties. In proportion as they advanced the resistance of\r\nthe enemy increased. The direct pursuit had soon to be abandoned, but\r\nin the hope of intercepting some part of the retreating mob Major Le\r\nGallais, who commanded the three leading squadrons, changed direction\r\ntowards the river, and, galloping nearly parallel to Khor Shambat,\r\ncharged and cut into the tail of the enemy's disordered array. The\r\nArabs, however, stood their ground, and, firing their rifles wildly in\r\nall directions, killed and wounded a good many horses and men, so that\r\nthe squadrons were content to bring up their right still more, and\r\nfinally to ride out of the hornet swarm, into which they had plunged,\r\ntowards Surgham Hill. The pursuit was then suspended, and the Egyptian\r\ncavalry joined the rest of the army by the Nile.\r\n\r\nIt was not until four o'clock that the cavalry received orders to ride\r\nround the outside of the city and harry such as should seek to escape.\r\nThe Egyptian squadrons and the 21st Lancers started forthwith, and,\r\nkeeping about a mile from the houses of the suburbs, proceeded to make\r\nthe circle of the town. The infantry had already entered it, as was\r\nevident from a continual patter of shots and an occasional rattle of\r\nthe Maxim guns. The leading Soudanese brigade--Maxwell's--had moved\r\nfrom Khor Shambat at 2.30, formed in line of company columns and in the\r\nfollowing order:--\r\n\r\n                      ^ Direction of Advance ^\r\n   XIVth       XIIth     Maxims     8th          32nd           XIIIth\r\n Soudanese   Soudanese           Egyptians   Field Battery   Soudanese\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar, attended by his whole Staff, with the Black Flag of the\r\nKhalifa carried behind him and accompanied by the band of the XIth\r\nSoudanese, rode in front of the XIVth battalion. The regiments were soon\r\nenveloped by the numberless houses of the suburbs and divided by the\r\ntwisting streets; but the whole brigade pressed forward on a broad\r\nfront. Behind followed the rest of the army--battalion after battalion,\r\nbrigade after brigade--until all, swallowed up by the maze of mud\r\nhouses, were filling the open spaces and blocking and choking the\r\nstreets and alleys with solid masses of armed men, who marched or pushed\r\ntheir way up to the great wall.\r\n\r\nFor two miles the progress through the suburbs continued, and the\r\nGeneral, hurrying on with his Staff, soon found himself, with the band,\r\nthe Maxims, and the artillery, at the foot of the great wall. Several\r\nhundred Dervishes had gathered for its defence; but the fact that no\r\nbanquette had been made on which they could stand to fire prevented\r\ntheir resistance from being effective. A few ill-aimed shots were,\r\nhowever, fired, to which the Maxim guns replied with vigour. In a\r\nquarter of an hour the wall was cleared. The Sirdar then posted two guns\r\nof the 32nd Field Battery at its northern angle, and then, accompanied\r\nby the remaining four guns and the XIVth Soudanese, turned eastwards and\r\nrode along the foot of the wall towards the river, seeking some means\r\nof entry into the inner city. The breach made by the gunboats was found\r\ntemporarily blocked by wooden doors, but the main gate was open, and\r\nthrough this the General passed into the heart of Omdurman. Within the\r\nwall the scenes were more terrible than in the suburbs. The effects\r\nof the bombardment were evident on every side. Women and children lay\r\nfrightfully mangled in the roadway. At one place a whole family had\r\nbeen crushed by a projectile. Dead Dervishes, already in the fierce heat\r\nbeginning to decompose, dotted the ground. The houses were crammed with\r\nwounded. Hundreds of decaying carcasses of animals filled the air with\r\na sickening smell. Here, as without the wall, the anxious inhabitants\r\nrenewed their protestations of loyalty and welcome; and interpreters,\r\nriding down the narrow alleys, proclaimed the merciful conditions of the\r\nconquerors and called on the people to lay down their arms. Great\r\npiles of surrendered weapons rose in the streets, guarded by Soudanese\r\nsoldiers. Many Arabs sought clemency; but there were others who\r\ndisdained it; and the whirring of the Maxims, the crashes of the\r\nvolleys, and a continual dropping fire attested that there was fighting\r\nin all parts of the city into which the columns had penetrated. All\r\nDervishes who did not immediately surrender were shot or bayoneted, and\r\nbullets whistled at random along or across the streets. But while women\r\ncrowded round his horse, while sullen men filed carefully from houses,\r\nwhile beaten warriors cast their spears on the ground and others, still\r\nresisting, were despatched in corners, the Sirdar rode steadily onward\r\nthrough the confusion, the stench, and the danger, until he reached the\r\nMahdi's Tomb.\r\n\r\nAt the mosque two fanatics charged the Soudanese escort, and each killed\r\nor badly wounded a soldier before he was shot. The day was now far\r\nspent, and it was dusk when the prison was reached. The General was the\r\nfirst to enter that foul and gloomy den. Charles Neufeld and some thirty\r\nheavily shackled prisoners were released. Neufeld, who was placed on a\r\npony, seemed nearly mad with delight, and talked and gesticulated with\r\nqueer animation. 'Thirteen years,' he said to his rescuer, 'have I\r\nwaited for this day.' From the prison, as it was now dark, the\r\nSirdar rode to the great square in front of the mosque, in which his\r\nheadquarters were established, and where both British brigades were\r\nalready bivouacking. The rest of the army settled down along the\r\nroadways through the suburbs, and only Maxwell's brigade remained in the\r\ncity to complete the establishment of law and order--a business which\r\nwas fortunately hidden by the shades of night.\r\n\r\nWhile the Sirdar with the infantry of the army was taking possession of\r\nOmdurman, the British and Egyptian cavalry had moved round to the west\r\nof the city. There for nearly two hours we waited, listening to the\r\ndropping fusillade which could be heard within the great wall and\r\nwondering what was happening. Large numbers of Dervishes and Arabs, who,\r\nlaying aside their jibbas, had ceased to be Dervishes, appeared among\r\nthe houses at the edge of the suburbs. Several hundreds of these, with\r\ntwo or three Emirs, came out to make their submission; and we were\r\npresently so loaded with spears and swords that it was impossible to\r\ncarry them, and many interesting trophies had to be destroyed. It was\r\njust getting dark when suddenly Colonel Slatin galloped up. The Khalifa\r\nhad fled! The Egyptian cavalry were at once to pursue him. The 21st\r\nLancers must await further orders. Slatin appeared very much in earnest.\r\nHe talked with animated manner to Colonel Broadwood, questioned two of\r\nthe surrendered Emirs closely, and hurried off into the dusk, while the\r\nEgyptian squadrons, mounting, also rode away at a trot.\r\n\r\nIt was not for some hours after he had left the field of battle that\r\nAbdullah realised that his army had not obeyed his summons, but were\r\ncontinuing their retreat, and that only a few hundred Dervishes remained\r\nfor the defence of the city. He seems, if we judge from the accounts\r\nof his personal servant, an Abyssinian boy, to have faced the disasters\r\nthat had overtaken him with singular composure. He rested until two\r\no'clock, when he ate some food. Thereafter he repaired to the Tomb, and\r\nin that ruined shrine, amid the wreckage of the shell-fire, the defeated\r\nsovereign appealed to the spirit of Mohammed Ahmed to help him in his\r\nsore distress. It was the last prayer ever offered over the Mahdi's\r\ngrave. The celestial counsels seem to have been in accord with the\r\ndictates of common-sense, and at four o'clock the Khalifa, hearing that\r\nthe Sirdar was already entering the city, and that the English cavalry\r\nwere on the parade ground to the west, mounted a small donkey, and,\r\naccompanied by his principal wife, a Greek nun as a hostage, and a\r\nfew attendants, rode leisurely off towards the south. Eight miles from\r\nOmdurman a score of swift camels awaited him, and on these he\r\nsoon reached the main body of his routed army. Here he found many\r\ndisheartened friends; but the fact that, in this evil plight, he found\r\nany friends at all must be recorded in his favour and in that of his\r\nsubjects. When he arrived he had no escort--was, indeed, unarmed. The\r\nfugitives had good reason to be savage. Their leaders had led them only\r\nto their ruin. To cut the throat of this one man who was the cause of\r\nall their sufferings was as easy as they would have thought it innocent.\r\nYet none assailed him. The tyrant, the oppressor, the scourge of the\r\nSoudan, the hypocrite, the abominated Khalifa; the embodiment, as he has\r\nbeen depicted to European eyes, of all the vices; the object, as he was\r\nbelieved in England, of his people's bitter hatred, found safety and\r\nwelcome among his flying soldiers. The surviving Emirs hurried to his\r\nside. Many had gone down on the fatal plain. Osman Azrak, the valiant\r\nBishara, Yakub, and scores whose strange names have not obscured these\r\npages, but who were, nevertheless, great men of war, lay staring up at\r\nthe stars. Yet those who remained never wavered in their allegiance.\r\nAli-Wad-Helu, whose leg had been shattered by a shell splinter, was\r\nsenseless with pain; but the Sheikh-ed-Din, the astute Osman Digna,\r\nIbrahim Khalil, who withstood the charge of the 21st Lancers, and others\r\nof less note rallied to the side of the appointed successor of Mohammed\r\nAhmed, and did not, even in this extremity, abandon his cause. And so\r\nall hurried on through the gathering darkness, a confused and miserable\r\nmultitude--dejected warriors still preserving their trashy rifles, and\r\nwounded men hobbling pitifully along; camels and donkeys laden with\r\nhousehold goods; women crying, panting, dragging little children; all in\r\nthousands--nearly 30,000 altogether; with little food and less water\r\nto sustain them; the desert before them, the gunboats on the Nile, and\r\nbehind the rumours of pursuit and a broad trail of dead and dying to\r\nmark the path of flight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Egyptian cavalry had already started on their fruitless\r\nerrand. The squadrons were greatly reduced in numbers. The men carried\r\nfood to suffice till morning, the horses barely enough to last till\r\nnoon. To supplement this slender provision a steamer had been ordered up\r\nthe river to meet them the next day with fresh supplies. The road by\r\nthe Nile was choked with armed Dervishes, and to avoid these dangerous\r\nfugitives the column struck inland and marched southward towards some\r\nhills whose dark outline showed against the sky. The unknown ground was\r\ndifficult and swampy. At times the horses floundered to their girths in\r\nwet sand; at others rocky khors obstructed the march; horses and camels\r\nblundered and fell. The darkness complicated the confusion. At about ten\r\no'clock Colonel Broadwood decided to go no further till there was more\r\nlight. He therefore drew off the column towards the desert, and halted\r\non a comparatively dry spot. Some muddy pools, which were luckily\r\ndiscovered, enabled the bottles to be filled and the horses to be\r\nwatered. Then, having posted many sentries, the exhausted pursuers\r\nslept, waking from time to time to listen to the intermittent firing\r\nwhich was still audible, both from the direction of Omdurman and from\r\nthat in which the Dervish army was flying.\r\n\r\nAt 3 A.M. on the 3rd Colonel Broadwood's force moved on again. Men and\r\nhorses seemed refreshed, and by the aid of a bright moon the ground was\r\ncovered at a good pace. By seven o'clock the squadrons approached the\r\npoint on the river which had been fixed for meeting the steamer. She\r\nhad already arrived, and the sight of the funnel in the distance and the\r\nanticipation of a good meal cheered everyone, for they had scarcely had\r\nanything to eat since the night before the battle. But as the troopers\r\ndrew nearer it became evident that 300 yards of shallow water and\r\ndeep swamp intervened between them and the vessel. Closer approach was\r\nprevented. There was no means of landing the stores. In the hopes of\r\nfinding a suitable spot further up the stream the march was resumed. The\r\nsteamer kept pace along the river. The boggy ground delayed the columns,\r\nbut by two o'clock seven more miles had been covered. Only the flag at\r\nthe masthead was now visible; and an impassable morass separated the\r\nforce from the river bank. It was impossible to obtain supplies. Without\r\nfood it was out of the question to go on. Indeed, great privations must,\r\nas it was, accompany the return march. The necessity was emphasised\r\nby the reports of captured fugitives, who all told the same tale. The\r\nKhalifa had pushed on swiftly, and was trying to reorganise his army.\r\nColonel Broadwood thereupon rested his horses till the heat of the day\r\nwas over, and then began the homeward march. It was not until eleven\r\no'clock on the 4th of September that the worn-out and famished cavalry\r\nreached their camp near Omdurman.\r\n\r\nSuch was the pursuit as conducted by the regular troops. Abdel-Azim,\r\nwith 750 Arabs, persisted still further in the chase. Lightly equipped,\r\nand acquainted with the country, they reached Shegeig, nearly a hundred\r\nmiles south of Khartoum, on the 7th. Here they obtained definite\r\ninformation. The Khalifa had two days' start, plenty of food and water,\r\nand many camels. He had organised a bodyguard of 500 Jehadia, and was,\r\nbesides, surrounded by a large force of Arabs of various tribes. With\r\nthis numerous and powerful following he was travelling day and night\r\ntowards El Obeid, which town was held by an unbeaten Dervish garrison\r\nof nearly 3,000 men. On hearing these things the friendly Arabs\r\ndetermined--not unwisely--to abandon the pursuit, and came boastfully\r\nback to Omdurman.\r\n\r\nIn the battle and capture of Omdurman the losses of the Expeditionary\r\nForce included the following British officers killed: Capt. G.\r\nCaldecott, 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment; Lieut. R.G. Grenfell, 12th\r\nRoyal Lancers, attached 21st Lancers; Hon. H. Howard, correspondent of\r\nthe TIMES. In total, the British Division and Egyptian Army suffered 482\r\nmen killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish losses were, from computations made on the field and\r\ncorrected at a later date, ascertained to be 9,700 killed, and wounded\r\nvariously estimated at from 10,000 to 16,000. There were, besides, 5,000\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII: 'THE FASHODA INCIDENT'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long succession of events, of which I have attempted to give some\r\naccount, has not hitherto affected to any great extent other countries\r\nthan those which are drained by the Nile. But this chapter demands a\r\nwider view, since it must describe an incident which might easily have\r\nconvulsed Europe, and from which far-reaching consequences have arisen.\r\nIt is unlikely that the world will ever learn the details of the subtle\r\nscheme of which the Marchand Mission was a famous part. We may say with\r\ncertainty that the French Government did not intend a small expedition,\r\nat great peril to itself, to seize and hold an obscure swamp on the\r\nUpper Nile. But it is not possible to define the other arrangements.\r\nWhat part the Abyssinians were expected to play, what services had been\r\nrendered them and what inducements they were offered, what attitude\r\nwas to be adopted to the Khalifa, what use was to be made of the local\r\ntribes: all this is veiled in the mystery of intrigue. It is well known\r\nthat for several years France, at some cost to herself and at a greater\r\ncost to Italy, had courted the friendship of Abyssinia, and that the\r\nweapons by which the Italians were defeated at Adowa had been\r\nmainly supplied through French channels. A small quick-firing gun\r\nof continental manufacture and of recent make which was found in\r\nthe possession of the Khalifa seems to point to the existence or\r\ncontemplation of similar relations with the Dervishes. But how far these\r\noperations were designed to assist the Marchand Mission is known only to\r\nthose who initiated them, and to a few others who have so far kept their\r\nown counsel.\r\n\r\nThe undisputed facts are few. Towards the end of 1896 a French\r\nexpedition was despatched from the Atlantic into the heart of Africa\r\nunder the command of Major Marchand. The re-occupation of Dongola was\r\nthen practically complete, and the British Government were earnestly\r\nconsidering the desirability of a further advance. In the beginning of\r\n1897 a British expedition, under Colonel Macdonald, and comprising\r\na dozen carefully selected officers, set out from England to Uganda,\r\nlanded at Mombassa, and struck inland. The misfortunes which fell upon\r\nthis enterprise are beyond the scope of this account, and I shall not\r\ndwell upon the local jealousies and disputes which marred it. It is\r\nsufficient to observe that Colonel Macdonald was provided with Soudanese\r\ntroops who were practically in a state of mutiny and actually mutinied\r\ntwo days after he assumed command. The officers were compelled to fight\r\nfor their lives. Several were killed. A year was consumed in suppressing\r\nthe mutiny and the revolt which arose out of it. If the object of\r\nthe expedition was to reach the Upper Nile, it was soon obviously\r\nunattainable, and the Government were glad to employ the officers in\r\nmaking geographical surveys.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1898 it was clear to those who, with the fullest\r\ninformation, directed the foreign policy of Great Britain that no\r\nresults affecting the situation in the Soudan could be expected from the\r\nMacdonald Expedition. The advance to Khartoum and the reconquest of the\r\nlost provinces had been irrevocably undertaken. An Anglo-Egyptian force\r\nwas already concentrating at Berber. Lastly, the Marchand Mission\r\nwas known to be moving towards the Upper Nile, and it was a probable\r\ncontingency that it would arrive at its destination within a few months.\r\nIt was therefore evident that the line of advance of the powerful army\r\nmoving south from the Mediterranean and of the tiny expedition moving\r\neast from the Atlantic must intersect before the end of the year, and\r\nthat intersection would involve a collision between the Powers of Great\r\nBritain and France.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to any special information not hitherto given to the\r\npublic in this further matter, but the reader may consider for himself\r\nwhether the conciliatory policy which Lord Salisbury pursued towards\r\nRussia in China at this time--a policy which excited hostile criticism\r\nin England--was designed to influence the impending conflict on the\r\nUpper Nile and make it certain, or at least likely, that when Great\r\nBritain and France should be placed in direct opposition, France should\r\nfind herself alone.\r\n\r\nWith these introductory reflections we may return to the theatre of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, five days after the battle and capture of\r\nOmdurman, the Tewfikia, a small Dervish steamer--one of those formerly\r\nused by General Gordon--came drifting and paddling down the river. Her\r\nArab crew soon perceived by the Egyptian flags which were hoisted on the\r\nprincipal buildings, and by the battered condition of the Mahdi's Tomb,\r\nthat all was not well in the city; and then, drifting a little further,\r\nthey found themselves surrounded by the white gunboats of the 'Turks,'\r\nand so incontinently surrendered. The story they told their captors was\r\na strange one. They had left Omdurman a month earlier, in company with\r\nthe steamer Safia, carrying a force of 500 men, with the Khalifa's\r\norders to go up the White Nile and collect grain. For some time all had\r\nbeen well; but on approaching the old Government station of Fashoda they\r\nhad been fired on by black troops commanded by white officers under\r\na strange flag--and fired on with such effect that they had lost some\r\nforty men killed and wounded. Doubting who these formidable enemies\r\nmight be, the foraging expedition had turned back, and the Emir in\r\ncommand, having disembarked and formed a camp at a place on the east\r\nbank called Reng, had sent the Tewfikia back to ask the Khalifa for\r\ninstructions and reinforcements. The story was carried to the Sirdar and\r\nran like wildfire through the camp. Many officers made their way to the\r\nriver, where the steamer lay, to test for themselves the truth of the\r\nreport. The woodwork of the hull was marked with many newly made holes,\r\nand cutting into these with their penknives the officers extracted\r\nbullets--not the roughly cast leaden balls, the bits of telegraph wire,\r\nor old iron which savages use, but the conical nickel-covered bullets of\r\nsmall-bore rifles such as are fired by civilised forces alone. Here was\r\npositive proof. A European Power was on the Upper Nile: which? Some said\r\nit was the Belgians from the Congo; some that an Italian expedition had\r\narrived; others thought that the strangers were French; others, again,\r\nbelieved in the Foreign Office--it was a British expedition, after all.\r\nThe Arab crew were cross-examined as to the flag they had seen. Their\r\nreplies were inconclusive. It had bright colours, they declared; but\r\nwhat those colours were and what their arrangement might be they could\r\nnot tell; they were poor men, and God was very great.\r\n\r\nCuriosity found no comfort but in patience or speculation. The camp for\r\nthe most part received the news with a shrug. After their easy victory\r\nthe soldiers walked delicately. They knew that they belonged to the most\r\npowerful force that had ever penetrated the heart of Africa. If there\r\nwas to be more war, the Government had but to give the word, and the\r\nGrand Army of the Nile would do by these newcomers as they had done by\r\nthe Dervishes.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th the Sirdar started up the White Nile for Fashoda with five\r\nsteamers, the XIth and XIIIth Battalions of Soudanese, two companies of\r\nthe Cameron Highlanders, Peake's battery of artillery, and four Maxim\r\nguns. Three days later he arrived at Reng, and there found, as the crew\r\nof the Tewfikia had declared, some 500 Dervishes encamped on the\r\nbank, and the Safia steamer moored to it. These stupid fellows had\r\nthe temerity to open fire on the vessels. Whereat the Sultan, steaming\r\ntowards their dem, replied with a fierce shell fire which soon put\r\nthem to flight. The Safia, being under steam, made some attempt to\r\nescape--whither, it is impossible to say--and Commander Keppel by a\r\nwell-directed shell in her boilers blew her up, much to the disgust of\r\nthe Sirdar, who wanted to add her to his flotilla.\r\n\r\nAfter this incident the expedition continued its progress up the White\r\nNile. The sudd which was met with two days' journey south of Khartoum\r\ndid not in this part of the Nile offer any obstacle to navigation, as\r\nthe strong current of the river clears the waterway; but on either side\r\nof the channel a belt of the tangled weed, varying from twelve to\r\ntwelve hundred yards in breadth, very often prevented the steamers\r\nfrom approaching the bank to tie up. The banks themselves depressed the\r\nexplorers by their melancholy inhospitality. At times the river flowed\r\npast miles of long grey grass and swamp-land, inhabited and habitable\r\nonly by hippopotami. At times a vast expanse of dreary mud flats\r\nstretched as far as the eye could see. At others the forest, dense with\r\nan impenetrable undergrowth of thorn-bushes, approached the water, and\r\nthe active forms of monkeys and even of leopards darted among the trees.\r\nBut the country--whether forest, mud-flat, or prairie--was always damp\r\nand feverish: a wet land steaming under a burning sun and humming with\r\nmosquitoes and all kinds of insect life.\r\n\r\nOnward and southward toiled the flotilla, splashing the brown water into\r\nfoam and startling the strange creatures on the banks, until on the 18th\r\nof September they approached Fashoda. The gunboats waited, moored to the\r\nbank for some hours of the afternoon, to allow a message which had been\r\nsent by the Sirdar to the mysterious Europeans, to precede his arrival,\r\nand early in the morning of the 19th a small steel rowing-boat was\r\nobserved coming down stream to meet the expedition. It contained a\r\nSenegalese sergeant and two men, with a letter from Major Marchand\r\nannouncing the arrival of the French troops and their formal occupation\r\nof the Soudan. It, moreover, congratulated the Sirdar on his victory,\r\nand welcomed him to Fashoda in the name of France.\r\n\r\nA few miles' further progress brought the gunboats to their destination,\r\nand they made fast to the bank near the old Government buildings of\r\nthe town. Major Marchand's party consisted of eight French officers or\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and 120 black soldiers drawn from the Niger\r\ndistrict. They possessed three steel boats fitted for sail or oars, and\r\na small steam launch, the Faidherbe, which latter had, however,\r\nbeen sent south for reinforcements. They had six months' supplies of\r\nprovisions for the French officers, and about three months' rations for\r\nthe men; but they had no artillery, and were in great want of small-arm\r\nammunition. Their position was indeed precarious. The little force\r\nwas stranded, without communications of any sort, and with no means of\r\neither withstanding an attack or of making a retreat. They had fired\r\naway most of their cartridges at the Dervish foraging party, and were\r\ndaily expecting a renewed attack. Indeed, it was with consternation that\r\nthey had heard of the approach of the flotilla. The natives had carried\r\nthe news swiftly up the river that the Dervishes were coming back with\r\nfive steamers, and for three nights the French had been sleeplessly\r\nawaiting the assault of a powerful enemy.\r\n\r\nTheir joy and relief at the arrival of a European force were\r\nundisguised. The Sirdar and his officers on their part were thrilled\r\nwith admiration at the wonderful achievements of this small band of\r\nheroic men. Two years had passed since they left the Atlantic coast.\r\nFor four months they had been absolutely lost from human ken. They had\r\nfought with savages; they had struggled with fever; they had climbed\r\nmountains and pierced the most gloomy forests. Five days and five nights\r\nthey had stood up to their necks in swamp and water. A fifth of their\r\nnumber had perished; yet at last they had carried out their mission and,\r\narriving at Fashoda on the 10th of July, had planted the tricolour upon\r\nthe Upper Nile.\r\n\r\nMoved by such reflections the British officers disembarked. Major\r\nMarchand, with a guard of honour, came to meet the General. They shook\r\nhands warmly. 'I congratulate you,' said the Sirdar, 'on all you have\r\naccomplished.' 'No,' replied the Frenchman, pointing to his troops; 'it\r\nis not I, but these soldiers who have done it.' And Kitchener, telling\r\nthe story afterwards, remarked, 'Then I knew he was a gentleman.'\r\n\r\nInto the diplomatic discussions that followed, it is not necessary\r\nto plunge. The Sirdar politely ignored the French flag, and, without\r\ninterfering with the Marchand Expedition and the fort it occupied,\r\nhoisted the British and Egyptian colours with all due ceremony,\r\namid musical honours and the salutes of the gunboats. A garrison was\r\nestablished at Fashoda, consisting of the XIth Soudanese, four guns of\r\nPeake's battery, and two Maxims, the whole under the command of Colonel\r\nJackson, who was appointed military and civil commandant of the Fashoda\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock on the same afternoon the Sirdar and the gunboats\r\nresumed their journey to the south, and the next day reached the mouth\r\nof the Sobat, sixty-two miles from Fashoda. Here other flags were\r\nhoisted and another post formed with a garrison of half the XIIIth\r\nSoudanese battalion and the remaining two guns of Peake's battery. The\r\nexpedition then turned northwards, leaving two gunboats--the Sultan and\r\nthe Abu Klea--at the disposal of Colonel Jackson.\r\n\r\nI do not attempt to describe the international negotiations and\r\ndiscussions that followed the receipt of the news in Europe, but it\r\nis pleasing to remember that a great crisis found England united. The\r\ndetermination of the Government was approved by the loyalty of the\r\nOpposition, supported by the calm resolve of the people, and armed with\r\nthe efficiency of the fleet. At first indeed, while the Sirdar was\r\nstill steaming southward, wonder and suspense filled all minds; but when\r\nsuspense ended in the certainty that eight French adventurers were in\r\noccupation of Fashoda and claimed a territory twice as large as France,\r\nit gave place to a deep and bitter anger. There is no Power in Europe\r\nwhich the average Englishman regards with less animosity than France.\r\nNevertheless, on this matter all were agreed. They should go. They\r\nshould evacuate Fashoda, or else all the might, majesty, dominion, and\r\npower of everything that could by any stretch of the imagination be\r\ncalled 'British' should be employed to make them go.\r\n\r\nThose who find it difficult to account for the hot, almost petulant,\r\nflush of resolve that stirred the nation must look back over the long\r\nhistory of the Soudan drama. It had always been a duty to reconquer the\r\nabandoned territory. When it was found that this might be safely done,\r\nthe duty became a pleasure. The operations were watched with extravagant\r\nattention, and while they progressed the earnestness of the nation\r\nincreased. As the tides of barbarism were gradually driven back, the\r\nold sea-marks came one after another into view. Names of towns that\r\nwere half forgotten--or remembered only with sadness--re-appeared on\r\nthe posters, in the gazettes, and in the newspapers. We were going back.\r\n'Dongola,' 'Berber,' 'Metemma'--who had not heard of them before? Now\r\nthey were associated with triumph. Considerable armies fought on the\r\nIndian Frontier. There was war in the South and the East and the West\r\nof Africa. But England looked steadfastly towards the Nile and the\r\nexpedition that crawled forward slowly, steadily, unchecked, apparently\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nWhen the final triumph, long expected, came in all its completeness it\r\nwas hailed with a shout of exultation, and the people of Great Britain,\r\nmoved far beyond their wont, sat themselves down to give thanks to their\r\nGod, their Government, and their General. Suddenly, on the chorus of\r\ntheir rejoicing there broke a discordant note. They were confronted with\r\nthe fact that a 'friendly Power' had, unprovoked, endeavoured to rob\r\nthem of the fruits of their victories. They now realised that while\r\nthey had been devoting themselves to great military operations, in broad\r\ndaylight and the eye of the world, and prosecuting an enterprise\r\non which they had set their hearts, other operations--covert and\r\ndeceitful--had been in progress in the heart of the Dark Continent,\r\ndesigned solely for the mischievous and spiteful object of depriving\r\nthem of the produce of their labours. And they firmly set their faces\r\nagainst such behaviour.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Great Britain was determined to have Fashoda or fight;\r\nand as soon as this was made clear, the French were willing to give way.\r\nFashoda was a miserable swamp, of no particular value to them. Marchand,\r\nLord Salisbury's 'explorer in difficulties upon the Upper Nile,'\r\nwas admitted by the French Minister to be merely an 'emissary of\r\ncivilisation.' It was not worth their while to embark on the hazards and\r\nconvulsions of a mighty war for either swamp or emissary. Besides, the\r\nplot had failed. Guy Fawkes, true to his oath and his orders, had indeed\r\nreached the vault; but the other conspirators were less devoted. The\r\nAbyssinians had held aloof. The negro tribes gazed with wonder on the\r\nstrangers, but had no intention of fighting for them. The pride and\r\nbarbarism of the Khalifa rejected all overtures and disdained to\r\ndiscriminate between the various breeds of the accursed 'Turks.'\r\nFinally, the victory of Omdurman and its forerunner--the Desert\r\nRailway--had revolutionised the whole situation in the Nile valley.\r\nAfter some weeks of tension, the French Government consented to withdraw\r\ntheir expedition from the region of the Upper Nile.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were passing at Fashoda. The town, the site of which\r\nhad been carefully selected by the old Egyptian Government, is situated\r\non the left bank of the river, on a gentle slope of ground which rises\r\nabout four feet above the level of the Nile at full flood. During the\r\nrainy season, which lasts from the end of June until the end of October,\r\nthe surrounding country is one vast swamp, and Fashoda itself becomes an\r\nisland. It is not, however, without its importance; for it is the only\r\nspot on the west shore for very many miles where landing from the river\r\nis possible. All the roads--mere camel-tracks--from Lower Kordofan meet\r\nat the Government post, but are only passable in the dry season. The\r\nsoil is fertile, and, since there is a superabundance of sun and water,\r\nalmost any crop or plant can be grown. The French officers, with the\r\nadaptive thrift of their nation, had already, in spite of the ravages\r\nof the water-rats, created a good vegetable garden, from which they\r\nwere able to supplement their monotonous fare. The natives,\r\nhowever--aboriginal negroes of the Dinka and Shillook tribes--are\r\nunwilling to work, except to provide themselves with the necessaries\r\nof life; and since these are easily obtained, there is very little\r\ncultivation, and the fertility of the soil may be said to increase\r\nthe poverty of the country. At all seasons of the year the climate of\r\nFashoda is pestilential, and the malarial fever attacks every European\r\nor Egyptian, breaking down the strongest constitutions, and in many\r\ncases causing death. [The place is most unhealthy, and in March 1899\r\n(the driest season of the year) out of a garrison of 317 men only 37\r\nwere fit for duty.--Sir William Garstin's Report: EGYPT, No. 5, 1899.]\r\n\r\nOn this dismal island, far from civilisation, health, or comfort, the\r\nMarchand Mission and the Egyptian garrison lived in polite antagonism\r\nfor nearly three months. The French fort stood at the northern end.\r\nThe Egyptian camp lay outside the ruins of the town. Civilities were\r\nconstantly exchanged between the forces, and the British officers\r\nrepaid the welcome gifts of fresh vegetables by newspapers and other\r\nconveniences. The Senegalese riflemen were smart and well-conducted\r\nsoldiers, and the blacks of the Soudanese battalion soon imitated their\r\nofficers in reciprocating courtesies. A feeling of mutual respect sprang\r\nup between Colonel Jackson and Major Marchand. The dashing commandant\r\nof the XIth Soudanese, whose Egyptian medals bear no fewer than fourteen\r\nclasps, was filled with a generous admiration for the French explorer.\r\nRealising the difficulties, he appreciated the magnificence of the\r\nachievement; and as he spoke excellent French a good and almost cordial\r\nunderstanding was established, and no serious disagreement occurred.\r\nBut, notwithstanding the polite relations, the greatest vigilance was\r\nexercised by both sides, and whatever civilities were exchanged were of\r\na formal nature.\r\n\r\nThe Dinkas and Shillooks had on the first arrival of the French made\r\nsubmission, and had supplied them with provisions. They knew that white\r\nmen were said to be coming, and they did not realise that there were\r\ndifferent races among the whites. Marchand was regarded as the advance\r\nguard of the Sirdar's army. But when the negroes gradually perceived\r\nthat these bands of white men were at enmity with each other--were, in\r\nfact, of rival tribes--they immediately transferred their allegiance to\r\nthe stronger force, and, although their dread of the Egyptian flag was\r\nat first very marked, boycotted the French entirely.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of October despatches from France arrived for Marchand by\r\nsteamer; and that officer, after reading them, determined to proceed to\r\nCairo. Jackson, who was most anxious that no disagreement should arise,\r\nbegged him to give positive orders to his subordinate to maintain the\r\nstatus quo, as had been agreed. Marchand gladly consented, and departed\r\nfor Omdurman, where he visited the battlefield, and found in the heaps\r\nof slain a grim witness of the destruction from which he had been saved,\r\nand so on to Cairo, where he was moved to tears and speeches. But in his\r\nabsence Captain Germain, who succeeded to the command, diverged from\r\nhis orders, No sooner had Marchand left than Germain, anxious to win\r\ndistinction, embarked upon a most aggressive policy. He occupied the\r\nDinka country on the right bank of the river, pushed reconnoitring\r\nparties into the interior, prevented the Dinka Sheikhs from coming to\r\nmake their submission at Fashoda, and sent his boats and the Faidherbe\r\nsteam launch, which had returned from the south, beyond the northern\r\nlimits which the Sirdar had prescribed and Marchand had agreed to\r\nrecognise.\r\n\r\nColonel Jackson protested again and again. Germain sent haughty replies,\r\nand persisted in his provoking policy. At last the British officer was\r\ncompelled to declare that if any more patrols were sent into the Dinka\r\ncountry, he would not allow them to return to the French post. Whereat\r\nGermain rejoined that he would meet force with force. All tempers were\r\nworn by fever, heat, discomfort, and monotony. The situation became very\r\ndifficult, and the tact and patience of Colonel Jackson alone averted\r\na conflict which would have resounded in all parts of the world. He\r\nconfined his troops strictly to their lines, and moved as far from the\r\nFrench camp as was possible. But there was one dark day when the French\r\nofficers worked in their shirts with their faithful Senegalese to\r\nstrengthen the entrenchments, and busily prepared for a desperate\r\nstruggle. On the other side little activity was noticeable. The Egyptian\r\ngarrison, although under arms, kept out of sight, but a wisp of steam\r\nabove the funnels of the redoubtable gunboats showed that all was ready.\r\n\r\nAt length in a fortunate hour Marchand returned, reproved his\r\nsubordinate, and expressed his regrets to Colonel Jackson. Then it\r\nbecame known that the French Government had ordered the evacuation of\r\nFashoda. Some weeks were spent in making preparations for the journey,\r\nbut at length the day of departure arrived. At 8.20 on the morning\r\nof the 11th of December the French lowered their flag with salute and\r\nflourish of bugle. The British officers, who remained in their own camp\r\nand did not obtrude themselves, were distant but interested spectators.\r\nOn the flag ceasing to fly, a sous-officier rushed up to the flagstaff\r\nand hurled it to the ground, shaking his fists and tearing his hair in\r\na bitterness and vexation from which it is impossible to withhold\r\nsympathy, in view of what these men had suffered uselessly and what they\r\nhad done. The French then embarked, and at 9.30 steamed southward, the\r\nFaidherbe towing one oblong steel barge and one old steel boat, the\r\nother three boats sailing, all full of men. As the little flotilla\r\npassed the Egyptian camp a guard of honour of the XIth Soudanese\r\nsaluted them and the band struck up their national anthem. The French\r\nacknowledged the compliment by dipping their flag, and in return the\r\nBritish and Egyptian flags were also lowered. The boats then continued\r\ntheir journey until they had rounded the bend of the river, when\r\nthey came to land, and, honour being duly satisfied, Marchand and his\r\nofficers returned to breakfast with Colonel Jackson. The meeting was\r\nvery friendly. Jackson and Germain exchanged most elaborate compliments,\r\nand the commandant, in the name of the XIth Soudanese, presented the\r\nexpedition with the banner of the Emir who had attacked them, which had\r\nbeen captured at Reng. Marchand shook hands all round, and the British\r\nofficers bade their gallant opponents a final farewell.\r\n\r\nOnce again the eight Frenchmen, who had come so far and accomplished so\r\nmuch, set out upon their travels, to make a safe though tedious journey\r\nthrough Abyssinia to the coast, and thence home to the country they\r\nhad served faithfully and well, and which was not unmindful of their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nLet us settle the international aspect of the reconquest of the Soudan\r\nwhile we are in the way with it. The disputes between France and England\r\nabout the valley of the Upper Nile were terminated, as far as material\r\ncause was concerned, by an Agreement, signed in London on the 21st of\r\nMarch, 1899, by Lord Salisbury and M. Cambon. The Declaration limiting\r\nthe respective spheres of influence of the two Powers took the form of\r\nan addition to the IVth Article of the Niger Convention, concluded in\r\nthe previous year. Its practical effect is to reserve the whole drainage\r\nsystem of the Nile to England and Egypt, and to engage that France shall\r\nhave a free hand, so far as those Powers are concerned, in the rest of\r\nNorthern Africa west of the Nile Valley not yet occupied by Europeans.\r\nThis stupendous partition of half a continent by two European Powers\r\ncould scarcely be expected to excite the enthusiasm of the rest. Germany\r\nwas, however, soothed by the promise of the observance of the 'Open\r\nDoor' policy upon the Upper Nile. Italy, protesting meekly, followed\r\nGermany. Russia had no interests in this quarter. France and England\r\nwere agreed. The rest were not consulted: and the Declaration may thus\r\nbe said to have been recognised by the world in general.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps early to attempt to pronounce with which of the\r\ncontracting Powers the advantage lies. France has acquired at a single\r\nstroke, without any serious military operations, the recognition\r\nof rights which may enable her ultimately to annex a vast African\r\nterritory. At present what she has gained may be described as a\r\nrecognised 'sphere of aspiration.' The future may convert this into\r\na sphere of influence, and the distant future may witness the entire\r\nsubjugation of the whole region. There are many difficulties to\r\nbe overcome. The powerful influence of the Senussi has yet to be\r\noverthrown. The independent kingdom of Wadai must be conquered. Many\r\nsmaller potentates will resist desperately. Altogether France has enough\r\nto occupy her in Central Africa for some time to come: and even when\r\nthe long task is finished, the conquered regions are not likely to be\r\nof great value. They include the desert of the Great Sahara and wide\r\nexpanses of equally profitless scrub or marsh. Only one important river,\r\nthe Shari, flows through them, and never reaches the sea: and even Lake\r\nChad, into which the Shari flows, appears to be leaking through some\r\nsubterranean exit, and is rapidly changing from a lake into an immense\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and Egypt, upon the other hand, have secured a territory\r\nwhich, though smaller, is nevertheless of enormous extent, more fertile,\r\ncomparatively easy of access, practically conquered, and containing the\r\nwaterway of the Nile. France will be able to paint a great deal of\r\nthe map of Africa blue, and the aspect of the continent upon paper may\r\nplease the patriotic eye; but it is already possible to predict that\r\nbefore she can develop her property--can convert aspiration into\r\ninfluence, and influence into occupation--she will have to work harder,\r\npay more, and wait longer for a return than will the more modest\r\nowners of the Nile Valley. And even when that return is obtained, it is\r\nunlikely that it will be of so much value.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to discuss the settlement made between the conquerors of\r\nthe Soudan. Great Britain and Egypt had moved hand in hand up the great\r\nriver, sharing, though unequally, the cost of the war in men and money.\r\nThe prize belonged to both. The direct annexation of the Soudan by Great\r\nBritain would have been an injustice to Egypt. Moreover, the claim of\r\nthe conquerors to Fashoda and other territories rested solely on the\r\nformer rights of Egypt. On the other hand, if the Soudan became\r\nEgyptian again, it must wear the fetters of that imprisoned country. The\r\nCapitulations would apply to the Upper Nile regions, as to the Delta.\r\nMixed Tribunals, Ottoman Suzerainty, and other vexatious burdens would\r\nbe added to the difficulties of Soudan administration. To free the new\r\ncountry from the curse of internationalism was a paramount object. The\r\nSoudan Agreement by Great Britain and Egypt, published on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1899, achieves this. Like most of the best work done in Egypt by\r\nthe British Agency, the Agreement was slipped through without attracting\r\nmuch notice. Under its authority a State has been created in the Nile\r\nValley which is neither British nor Ottoman, nor anything else so far\r\nknown to the law of Europe. International jurists are confronted with an\r\nentirely new political status. A diplomatic 'Fourth Dimension' has\r\nbeen discovered. Great Britain and Egypt rule the country together.\r\nThe allied conquerors have become the joint-possessors. 'What does this\r\nSoudan Agreement mean?' the Austrian Consul-General asked Lord Cromer;\r\nand the British Agent, whom twenty-two years' acquaintance with Egyptian\r\naffairs bad accustomed to anomalies, replied, 'It means simply this';\r\nand handed him the inexplicable document, under which the conquered\r\ncountry may some day march to Peace and Plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: ON THE BLUE NILE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Khalifa and the strength of his army were for\r\never broken on the 2nd of September, and the battle of Omdurman is the\r\nnatural climax of this tale of war. To those who fought, and still more\r\nto those who fell, in the subsequent actions the climax came somewhat\r\nlater. After the victory the public interest was no longer centred in\r\nthe Soudan. The last British battalion had been carried north of Assuan;\r\nthe last Press correspondent had hurried back to Cairo or London. But\r\nthe military operations were by no means over.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had been defeated. It remained to reconquer the territory. The\r\nDervishes of the provincial garrisons still preserved their allegiance\r\nto the Khalifa. Several strong Arab forces kept the field. Distant\r\nKordofan and even more distant Darfur were as yet quite unaffected by\r\nthe great battle at the confluence of the Niles. There were rumours of\r\nEuropeans in the Far South.\r\n\r\nThe unquestioned command of the waterways which the Sirdar enjoyed\r\nenabled the greater part of the Egyptian Soudan to be at once formally\r\nre-occupied. All towns or stations on the main rivers and their\r\ntributaries were at the mercy of the gunboats. It was only necessary to\r\nsend troops to occupy them and to hoist the British and Egyptian flags.\r\nTwo expeditions were forthwith sent up the White and Blue Niles to\r\nestablish garrisons, and as far as possible to subdue the country. The\r\nfirst, under the personal command of the Sirdar, left Omdurman on the\r\n8th of September, and steamed up the White Nile towards Fashoda. The\r\nevents which followed that momentous journey have already been related.\r\nThe second expedition consisted of the gunboats Sheikh and Hafir,\r\ntogether with two companies and the brass band of the Xth Soudanese\r\nand a Maxim battery, all under the command of General Hunter. Leaving\r\nOmdurman on the 19th of September, they started up the Blue Nile to Abu\r\nHaraz. The rest of the Xth Battalion followed as soon as other steamers\r\nwere set free from the business of taking the British division to the\r\nAtbara and bringing supplies to Omdurman. The progress of the expedition\r\nup the river resembled a triumphal procession. The people of the\r\nriparian villages assembled on the banks, and, partly from satisfaction\r\nat being relieved from the oppression of the Khalifa and the scourge\r\nof war, partly from fear, and partly from wonder, gave vent to loud and\r\nlong-continued cheers. As the gunboats advanced the inhabitants escorted\r\nthem along the bank, the men dancing and waving their swords, and the\r\nwomen uttering shrill cries of welcome. The reception of the expedition\r\nwhen places of importance were passed, and the crowd amounted to several\r\nthousands, is described as very stirring, and, we are told, such was the\r\nenthusiasm of the natives that they even broke up their houses to supply\r\nthe gunboats with wood for fuel. Whether this be true or not I cannot\r\ntell, but it is in any case certain that the vessels were duly supplied,\r\nand that the expedition in its progress was well received by the negroid\r\ntribes, who had long resented the tyranny of the Arabs.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of September a considerable part of the army of Osman Digna,\r\nwhich had not been present at the battle of Omdurman, was found encamped\r\non the Ghezira, a few miles north of Rufaa. The Sheikhs and Emirs, on\r\nbeing summoned by General Hunter, surrendered, and a force of about\r\n2,000 men laid down their arms. Musa Digna, a nephew of Osman and the\r\ncommander of his forces, was put in irons and held prisoner. The rest,\r\nwho were mostly from the Suakin district, were given a safe-conduct, and\r\ntold to return to their homes--an order they lost no time in obeying.\r\n\r\nThe next day the general arrived at Wad Medina, where the Dervish\r\ngarrison--1,000 strong--had already surrendered to the gunboat Sheikh.\r\nThese men, who were regular Dervishes, were transported in sailing-boats\r\nto Omdurman; and augmented the number of prisoners of war already\r\ncollected. On the 29th of September General Hunter reached Rosaires, 400\r\nmiles south of Khartoum, and the extreme limit of steam navigation on\r\nthe Blue Nile. By the 3rd of October he had established garrisons of\r\nthe Xth Soudanese in Rosaires, at Karkoj, at Sennar (the old seat of the\r\nGovernment of the province), and at Wad Medina. Having also arranged for\r\ngunboat patrolling, he returned to Omdurman.\r\n\r\nBut there was one Dervish force which had no intention of surrendering\r\nto the invaders, and whose dispersal was not accomplished until three\r\nfierce and critical actions had been fought. Ahmed Fedil, a zealous and\r\ndevoted adherent of the Khalifa, had been sent, after the defeat on\r\nthe Atbara, to collect all the Dervishes who could be spared from the\r\nGedaref and Gallabat provinces, and bring them to join the growing army\r\nat Omdurman. The Emir had faithfully discharged his duty, and he was\r\nhurrying to his master's assistance with a strong and well disciplined\r\nforce of no fewer than 8,000 men when, while yet sixty miles from the\r\ncity, he received the news of 'the stricken field.' He immediately\r\nhalted, and sought to hide the disaster from his soldiers by announcing\r\nthat the Khalifa had been victorious and no longer needed their\r\nassistance. He even explained the appearance of gunboats upon the river\r\nby saying that these had run past the batteries at Omdurman and that the\r\nothers were destroyed. The truth was not, however, long concealed; for\r\na few days later two emissaries despatched by Slatin arrived at the\r\nDervish camp and announced the destruction of the Omdurman army, the\r\nflight of the Khalifa, and the fall of the city. The messengers were\r\nauthorised to offer Ahmed terms; but that implacable Dervish flew into\r\na rage, and, having shot one, sent the other, covered with insults and\r\nstripes, to tell the 'Turks' that he would fight to the bitter end. He\r\nthen struck his camp, and marched back along the east bank of the Blue\r\nNile, with the intention of crossing the river near its confluence\r\nwith the Rahad, and so joining the Khalifa in Kordofan. His Dervishes,\r\nhowever, did not view this project with satisfaction. Their families\r\nand women had been left with large stores of grain and ammunition\r\nin Gedaref, under a strong garrison of 3,000 men. They urged their\r\ncommander to return and collect these possessions. Ahmed at first\r\nrefused, but when on arriving at the place of passage he found himself\r\nconfronted with a gunboat, he resolved to make a virtue of necessity and\r\nset out leisurely for Gedaref.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September Colonel Parsons, in command of the forces at\r\nKassala, heard through the Italian Governor of Eritrea of the victory\r\nat Omdurman. The next day official news arrived from England, and in\r\nconformity with previous instructions he set out on the 7th for Gedaref.\r\nIt was known that Ahmed Fedil had marched towards Omdurman. It was\r\nbelieved that Gedaref was only weakly held, and the opportunity of\r\ncutting the most powerful remaining Dervish army from its base was\r\ntoo precious to be neglected. But the venture was desperate. The whole\r\navailable strength of the Kassala garrison was mustered. With these\r\n1,350 motley soldiers, untried, little disciplined, worn with waiting\r\nand wasted by disease, without cavalry, artillery, or machine guns,\r\nand with only seven British officers, including the doctor, Gedaref was\r\ntaken, and, having been taken, was held.\r\n\r\nAfter two long marches Colonel Parsons and his force arrived at El\r\nFasher, on the right bank of the Atbara. Their advance, which had\r\nhitherto led them through a waterless desert, was now checked by a\r\nraging torrent. The river was in full flood, and a channel of deep\r\nwater, broader than the Thames below London Bridge and racing along\r\nat seven miles an hour, formed a serious obstacle. Since there were no\r\nboats the soldiers began forthwith to construct rafts from barrels that\r\nhad been brought for the purpose. As soon as the first of these was\r\ncompleted, it was sent on a trial trip. The result was not encouraging.\r\nThe raft supported ten men, occupied five hours in the passage, was\r\ncarried ten miles down stream, and came back for its second journey\r\non the afternoon of the next day. It was evident that this means of\r\ntransport was out of the question. The only chance of success--indeed,\r\nof safety--lay in the force reaching and taking Gedaref before the\r\nreturn of Ahmed Fedil. All depended upon speed; yet here was a hopeless\r\ndelay. After prolonged discussion it was resolved to act on the\r\nsuggestion of an Egyptian officer and endeavour to build boats. The work\r\nproved easier than was anticipated. The elastic wood of the mimosa scrub\r\nsupplied the frames; some tarpaulins--fortunately available--formed\r\nthe outer covering. The Egyptian soldiers, who delighted in the work,\r\nsucceeded in making daily from such materials one boat capable of\r\ncarrying two tons; and in these ingenious contrivances the whole force\r\ncrossed to the further bank. The camels, mules, and horses of the\r\ntransport--their heads supported with inflated water-skins tied under\r\ntheir jowls--were made to swim across the river by the local Shukrieh\r\nArabs. Such was the skill of these tribesmen that only one camel and one\r\nmule were drowned during the operation. The passage was completed on the\r\n16th, and the next day the advance was resumed along the west bank of\r\nthe Atbara. At midday on the 18th Mugatta was reached, and at dawn on\r\nthe 20th the little force--having filled their water-skins, tightened\r\ntheir belts, and invoked the assistance of the various gods they\r\nworshipped--started off, and marched all day in single file through the\r\nthick bush which lies between the Atbara and Gedaref. The column retired\r\nto rest peacefully during the night of the 21st, although within twelve\r\nmiles of Gedaref. But at midnight startling news arrived. A deserter\r\nfrom the Dervishes made his way into the camp and informed Colonel\r\nParsons that the Emir Saadalla awaited him with 3,500 men two miles\r\nbefore the town. The situation was grave. A retreat through the broken\r\ncountry and thick bush in the face of a powerful and triumphant enemy\r\nseemed impossible. There was no alternative but to attack.\r\n\r\nVery early on the morning of the 22nd--the same day on which General\r\nHunter on the Blue Nile was compelling Musa Digna and his followers to\r\nsurrender--Colonel Parsons and the Kassala column set forth to march\r\ninto Gedaref and to fight whatever force it might contain. For the first\r\ntwo hours the road lay through doura plantations and high grass which\r\nrose above the heads even of men mounted on camels; but as the town was\r\napproached, the doura ceased, and the troops emerged from the jungle on\r\nto an undulating moorland with occasional patches of rushes and withered\r\ngrass. At half-past seven, and about three miles from Gedaref, the\r\nenemy's scouts were encountered. A few shots were fired. The soldiers\r\npressed their march, and at eight o'clock had reached a small knoll,\r\nfrom the top of which an extensive view was obtainable. The column\r\nhalted, and Colonel Parsons and his officers ascended the eminence to\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\nA most menacing spectacle confronted them. Scarcely a mile away a strong\r\nforce of Dervishes was rapidly advancing to meet the invaders. Four\r\nlines of white figures rising out of the grass showed by their length\r\nthe number, and by their regularity the discipline, of the enemy. The\r\nofficers computed the strength of their antagonists at not fewer than\r\n4,000. Subsequent investigation has shown that the Emir Saadalla marched\r\nout of Gedaref with 1,700 riflemen, 1,600 spearmen, and 300 horse.\r\n\r\nThe swiftness of the Dervish advance and the short space that intervened\r\nbetween the forces made it evident that a collision would take place\r\nwithin half an hour. The valley was rocky, and overgrown with grass and\r\nreeds; but to the right of the track there rose a high saddleback hill,\r\nthe surface of which looked more open, and which appeared to command\r\nthe approaches from Gedaref. The troops knew nothing of the country;\r\nthe Dervishes understood it thoroughly. The high ground gave at least\r\nadvantage of view. Colonel Parsons resolved to occupy it. Time was\r\nhowever, very scanty.\r\n\r\nThe order was given, and the column began to double across the valley\r\ntowards the saddleback. The Dervishes, perceiving the nature of the\r\nmovement, hurried their advance in the hope of catching the troops on\r\nthe move and perhaps of even seizing the hill itself. But they were too\r\nlate. Colonel Parsons and his force reached the saddleback safely, and\r\nwith a few minutes to spare climbed up and advanced along it in column\r\nin the direction of Gedaref--the Arab battalion leading, the 16th\r\nEgyptians next, and last of all the irregulars.\r\n\r\nThe Dervishes, seeing that the troops had already reached the hill and\r\nwere moving along it towards the town, swung to their left and advanced\r\nto the attack. Thereupon at half-past eight the column wheeled into line\r\nto meet them, and standing in the long grass, which even on the summit\r\nof the hill was nearly breast-high, opened a heavy and destructive fire.\r\nThe enemy, although suffering severe loss, continued to struggle bravely\r\nonward, replying vigorously to the musketry of the soldiers. At nine\r\no'clock, while the frontal attack was still undecided, Colonel Parsons\r\nbecame aware that a strong force of Dervishes had moved round the left\r\nrear and were about to attack the hospital and transport. He at once\r\nsent to warn Captain Fleming, R.A.M.C., who combined the duties of\r\nmedical officer and commander of the baggage column, of the impending\r\nassault, and directed him to close up the camels and meet it. The Arab\r\nSheikhs, who in the absence of officers were acting as orderlies, had\r\nscarcely brought the news to Fleming, when the Dervish attack developed.\r\nThe enemy, some 300 strong, rushed with great determination upon the\r\nbaggage, and the escort of 120 Arab irregulars at once broke and fled.\r\nThe situation became desperate; but Ruthven with thirty-four Supply\r\nDepartment camel-men hastened to meet the exultant enemy and protect the\r\nbaggage column, and the transport was stubbornly defended. In spite of\r\nall their efforts the rear of the baggage column was broken and cut up.\r\nThe survivors escaped along the saddleback. The British officers, with\r\ntheir small following, fell back towards their main body, hotly pressed\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Captain Ruthven observed one of his native officers,\r\nlying wounded on the ground, about to fall into the hands of the\r\nDervishes and perish miserably. He immediately went back and, being a\r\nman of great physical strength, carried the body off in his arms. The\r\nenemy were, however, so close that he was three times compelled to set\r\nhis burden down and defend himself with his revolver. Meanwhile the\r\nretirement towards the main body continued and accelerated.\r\n\r\nColonel Parsons and his force were now between two fires. The frontal\r\nattack was within 200 yards. The rear attack, flushed with success,\r\nwere hurrying impetuously forward. The defeat and consequent total\r\ndestruction of the Kassala column appeared certain. But in the nick of\r\ntime the Dervish frontal attack, which had been suffering heavily from\r\nthe fire of the troops, wavered; and when the Arab battalion and the\r\n16th Egyptians advanced upon them to complete their discomfiture, they\r\nbroke and fled. Colonel Parsons at once endeavoured to meet the rear\r\nattack. The Arab battalion, whose valour was more admirable than their\r\ndiscipline, continued to pursue the beaten enemy down the hill; but\r\nthe 16th Egyptians, on being called upon by their commanding officer,\r\nCaptain McKerrell, faced steadily about and turned to encounter the\r\nfresh attack.\r\n\r\nThe heavy fire of the regular battalion checked the Dervish advance, and\r\nCaptain Fleming, the rest of the dismounted camel-men, and Ruthven\r\nstill carrying his native officer, found safety in their ranks. [For\r\nhis gallantry on this occasion Captain Ruthven has since received the\r\nVictoria Cross.] A short fierce musketry combat followed at a range of\r\nless than a hundred yards, at the end of which the assailants of the\r\nbaggage convoy were completely repulsed. The action was now practically\r\nover and success was won. The Arab battalion, and those of the\r\nirregulars that had rallied, advanced and drove the enemy before them\r\ntowards Gedaref, until at ten o'clock, both their front and rear attacks\r\nhaving failed, the Dervishes abandoned all resistance and a general rout\r\nensued. No cavalry or artillery being available, further pursuit was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe town of Gedaref surrendered at noon. The Dervish Emir, Nur Angara,\r\nwho with 200 black riflemen and two brass guns had been left in command\r\nof the garrison, made haste to submit. The remainder of the Dervishes,\r\ncontinuing their flight under the Emir Saadalla, hurried to tell the\r\ntale of defeat to Ahmed Fedil.\r\n\r\nThe casualties suffered by the Kassala column in the action were severe\r\nin proportion to their numbers and the duration of the fight. The\r\nseven British officers escaped untouched; but of the 1,400 soldiers and\r\nirregulars engaged, 51 were killed and 80 wounded--a total of 131. The\r\nDervishes left 500 dead on the field, including four Emirs of rank.\r\n\r\nThe victory had been won, the enemy were routed, and the town was\r\ntaken: it had now to be defended. Colonel Parsons took possession of\r\nthe principal buildings, and began immediately to put them in a state of\r\ndefence. This was fortunately an easy matter. The position was good and\r\nadaptable. It consisted of three large enclosures, capable of holding\r\nthe entire force, situated in echelon, so as to protect each other by\r\ntheir fire, and with strong brick walls six feet high. All were at once\r\nset to work to clear the approaches, to level the mud houses without,\r\nand to build ramparts or banquettes within the walls. The three\r\nenclosures thus became three forts, and in the principal work the two\r\ncaptured brass guns were mounted, in small bastions thrown out from the\r\nnorth and west corners. While the infantry were thus engaged, Ruthven\r\nand his camel-men made daily reconnaissances of the surrounding country,\r\nand eagerly looked for the first appearance of Ahmed Fedil.\r\n\r\nBy great good fortune a convoy of ammunition from Mugatta reached\r\nGedaref on the afternoon of the 27th. At dawn the next day Ruthven\r\nreported that the advance guard of Ahmed Fedil was approaching the town.\r\nThe attack began at half-past eight. The Dervishes, who fought with\r\ntheir customary gallantry, simultaneously assaulted the north, south,\r\nand west faces of the defences. Creeping forward through the high\r\ndoura, they were able to get within 300 yards of the enclosures. But the\r\nintervening space had been carefully cleared of cover, and was swept by\r\nthe musketry of the defenders. All attempts to cross this ground--even\r\nthe most determined rushes--proved vain. While some made hopeless\r\ncharges towards the walls, others crowded into a few straw shelters\r\nand mud huts which the troops had not found opportunity to remove, and\r\nthence maintained a ragged fire. After an hour's heavy fusillade the\r\nattack weakened, and presently ceased altogether. At ten o'clock,\r\nhowever, strong reinforcements having come up, the Dervishes made a\r\nsecond attempt. They were again repulsed, and at a quarter to eleven,\r\nafter losing more than 500 men in killed and wounded, Ahmed Fedil\r\nadmitted his defeat and retired to a clump of palm-trees two miles to\r\nthe west of the town. The casualties among the defenders were five men\r\nkilled, one British officer (Captain Dwyer) and thirteen men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Dervishes remained for two days in the palm grove, and their leader\r\nrepeatedly endeavoured to induce them to renew the attack. But although\r\nthey closely surrounded the enclosures, and maintained a dropping fire,\r\nthey refused to knock their heads against brick walls a third time;\r\nand on the 1st of October Ahmed Fedil was forced to retire to a more\r\nconvenient camp eight miles to the southward. Here for the next three\r\nweeks he remained, savage and sulky; and the Kassala column were content\r\nto keep to their defences. A few convoys from Mugatta made their way\r\ninto the forts under the cover of darkness, but for all practical\r\npurposes the blockade of the garrison was complete. Their losses in\r\naction had reduced their strength. They were not abundantly supplied\r\nwith ammunition. The smell of the putrefying corpses which lay around\r\nthe walls and in the doura crop, together with the unhealthy climate and\r\nthe filth of the town, was a fertile source of disease. A painful and\r\nracking fever afflicted all ranks, and at one time as many as 270 of the\r\n400 regular soldiers were prostrated. The recurring night alarms added\r\nto the fatigues of the troops and the anxieties of the seven officers.\r\nThe situation was indeed so unsatisfactory that Colonel Parsons was\r\ncompelled to ask for assistance.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Rundle, who in the Sirdar's absence held the chief\r\ncommand, immediately organised a relief expedition. The IXth, XIIth, and\r\nhalf of the XIIIth Soudanese, with three companies of the Camel Corps,\r\nunder Colonel Collinson, were at once sent from Omdurman to the mouth of\r\nthe Rahad river. The infantry were conveyed in steamers; the Camel Corps\r\nmarched along the bank, completing the whole distance of 130 miles in\r\nfifty-six hours. The Blue Nile garrisons, with the exception of the post\r\nat Rosaires, were also concentrated. By the 8th of October the whole\r\nforce was collected at Abu Haraz. Five hundred camels, which had marched\r\nfrom Omdurman, and every available local beast of burden joined the\r\ntransport of the column. On the 9th the XIIth Soudanese started up the\r\nRahad river for Ain el Owega. From this point the road leaves the river\r\nand strikes across the desert to Gedaref, a distance of 100 miles; and\r\nin the whole distance water is only found at the wells of El Kau. Owing\r\nto this scarcity of water it was necessary to carry a supply with the\r\ntroops. The transport being insufficient to provide for the whole force,\r\nthe march had to be made in two columns. The Camel Corps and the XIIth\r\nSoudanese, about 1,200 strong, set forth under Colonel Collinson from\r\nAin el Owega on the 17th, and reached Gedaref safely on the 22nd. Warned\r\nof their arrival, Ahmed Fedil, having made a feeble night attack which\r\nwas repulsed by the garrison with a loss to themselves of two Soudanese\r\nwounded, realised that he had now no chance of recapturing the town.\r\nPreparations were indeed made to attack him; but on the 23rd of October,\r\nwhen a reconnaissance was made in the direction of his camp, the Dervish\r\nforce was seen moving off in a southerly direction, their retreat\r\ncovered by a strong rearguard, which was intended to perform the double\r\nduty of protecting the retirement and preventing desertion.\r\n\r\nThe operations conducted by Colonel Parsons thus ended in complete\r\nsuccess. Great difficulties were overcome, great perils were\r\nencountered, great results were obtained. But while we applaud the skill\r\nof the commander and the devotion of his subordinates, it is impossible\r\nnot to criticise the rash and over-confident policy which sent such a\r\nweak and ill-equipped force on so hazardous an enterprise. The action of\r\nGedaref, as has been shown, was, through no fault of the officers or\r\nmen of the expedition, within an ace of being a disaster. But there were\r\nother critical occasions when only the extraordinary good fortune which\r\nattended the force saved it from destruction. First, the column was not\r\ndiscovered until it reached Mugatta; secondly, it was not attacked in\r\nthe thick bush; thirdly, the Dervishes gave battle in the open instead\r\nof remaining within their walls, whence the troops could not have driven\r\nthem without artillery; and, fourthly, the reserve ammunition arrived\r\nbefore the attack of Ahmed Fedil.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat before Gedaref, Ahmed Fedil reverted to his intention\r\nof joining the Khalifa in Kordofan, and he withdrew southwards towards\r\nthe Dinder river with a following that still numbered more than 5,000.\r\nTo pass the Nile in the face of the gunboats appeared impossible. He did\r\nnot, however, believe that steamers could navigate the higher reaches\r\nof the rivers, and in the hopes of finding a safe crossing-place he\r\ndirected his march so as to strike the Blue Nile south of Karkoj. Moving\r\nleisurely, and with frequent delays to pillage the inhabitants, he\r\narrived on the Dinder, twenty-five miles to the east of Karkoj, on the\r\n7th of November. Here he halted to reconnoitre. He had trusted in the\r\nKarkoj-Rosaires reach being too shallow for the gunboats; but he found\r\ntwo powerful vessels already patrolling it. Again frustrated, he turned\r\nsouthwards, meaning to cross above the Rosaires Cataract, which was\r\nwithout doubt impassable to steamers.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of October Colonel Lewis, with two companies of the Camel\r\nCorps and three squadrons of cavalry, started from Omdurman with\r\nthe object of marching through the centre of the Ghezira and of\r\nre-establishing the Egyptian authority. His progress was in every way\r\nsuccessful. The inhabitants were submissive, and resigned themselves\r\nwith scarcely a regret to orderly government. Very little lawlessness\r\nhad followed the defeat of the Khalifa, and whatever plundering there\r\nhad been was chiefly the work of the disbanded irregulars who had fought\r\nat Omdurman under Major Wortley's command on the east bank of the Nile.\r\nIn every village Sheikhs were appointed in the name of the Khedive,\r\nand the officers of the cavalry column concerned themselves with many\r\ndifficult disputes about land, crops, and women--all of which they\r\nsettled to their satisfaction. Marching through Awamra, Haloosen, and\r\nMesalamia, Colonel Lewis reached Karkoj on the 7th of November, almost\r\nat the same time that Ahmed Fedil arrived on the Dinder.\r\n\r\nFor the next six weeks the movements of the two forces resembled a game\r\nof hide-and-seek. Ahmed Fedil, concealed in the dense forest and jungle\r\nof the east bank, raided the surrounding villages and worked his way\r\ngradually towards the Rosaires Cataract. Colonel Lewis, perplexed by\r\nfalse and vague information, remained halted at Karkoj, despatched vain\r\nreconnaissances in the hopes of obtaining reliable news, revolved deep\r\nschemes to cut off the raiding parties, or patrolled the river in the\r\ngunboats. And meanwhile sickness fell upon his force. The malarial\r\nfever, which is everywhere prevalent on the Blue Nile in the autumn,\r\nwas now at its height. More than 30 per cent of every garrison and every\r\npost were affected. The company holding Rosaires were stricken to a man,\r\nand only the two British officers remained fit for duty. The cavalry\r\nforce which had marched through the Ghezira suffered the most severely.\r\nOne after another every British officer was stricken down and lay\r\nburning but helpless beneath the palm-leaf shelters or tottered on to\r\nthe friendly steamers that bore the worst cases north. Of the 460 men\r\nwho composed the force, ten had died and 420 were reported unfit for\r\nduty within a month of their arrival at Karkoj.\r\n\r\nDuring the end of November the Sheikh Bakr, who had deserted the\r\nDervishes after their retreat from Gedaref, arrived at Karkoj with 350\r\nirregulars. He claimed to have defeated his former chief many times, and\r\nproduced a sack of heads as evidence of his success. His loyalty being\r\nthus placed beyond doubt, he was sent to keep contact with the Dervishes\r\nand encouraged to the greatest efforts by the permission to appropriate\r\nwhatever spoils of war he could capture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ahmed Fedil was working his way slowly southward along a deep\r\nkhor which runs almost parallel to the Blue Nile and is perhaps\r\ntwenty miles from it. As soon as the position of the Dervish Emir\r\nwas definitely known, Colonel Lewis moved his force, which had been\r\nstrengthened by detachments of the Xth Soudanese, from Karkoj to\r\nRosaires. Here he remained for several days, with but little hope of\r\nobstructing the enemy's passage of the river. On the 20th of\r\nDecember, however, full--though, as was afterwards found, not very\r\naccurate--information was received. It was reported that on the 18th\r\nAhmed Fedil had reached the village of Dakhila, about twenty miles south\r\nof the Rosaires post; that he himself had immediately crossed with his\r\nadvanced guard, and was busily passing the women and children across the\r\nriver on rafts.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, therefore, Colonel Lewis hurried the Sheikh Bakr up the\r\nwest bank to cut off their flocks and harass the Dervishes who had\r\nalready crossed the river. The irregulars accordingly departed; and\r\nthe next day news was brought that the Dervish force was almost equally\r\ndivided by the Blue Nile, half being on one bank and half on the other.\r\nAt midday on the 24th the gunboats Melik and Dal arrived from Omdurman\r\nwith a detachment of 200 more men of the Xth Soudanese under Major\r\nFergusson, and thirty men of the IXth Soudanese under Captain Sir Henry\r\nHill. With this addition the force at Colonel Lewis's disposal consisted\r\nof half the Xth Soudanese, a small detachment of the IXth Soudanese, two\r\nMaxim guns, and a doctor. Besides the regular troops, there were also\r\nthe band of irregulars under the Sheikh Bakr, numbering 380 men, 100 men\r\nunder the Sheikh of Rosaires, and a few other unclassified scallywags.\r\n\r\nColonel Lewis determined to attack what part of Ahmed Fedil's force\r\nstill remained on the east bank of the river, and on Christmas Day, at\r\nfive o'clock in the afternoon, he marched with every man he could muster\r\nin the direction of Dakhila.\r\n\r\nMoving in single file along a track which led through a dense forest of\r\nthorny trees, the column reached Adu Zogholi, a village thought to be\r\nhalf, but really not one-third, of the way to Dakhila, at eleven o'clock\r\non Christmas night. Here they bivouacked until 3 A.M. on the 26th, when\r\nthe march was resumed in the same straggling order through the same\r\ntangled scrub. Daylight found them still several miles from the Dervish\r\nposition, and it was not until eight o'clock that the enemy's outposts\r\nwere discovered. After a few shots the Arab picket fell back, and the\r\nadvance guard, hurrying after them, emerged from the forest upon the\r\nopen ground of the river bank, broken only by palms and patches of high\r\ngrass. Into this space the whole column gradually debouched. Before them\r\nthe Blue Nile, shining in the early sunlight like a silver band, flowed\r\nswiftly; and beyond its nearest waters rose a long, bare, gravel island\r\ncrowned with clumps of sandhills, to the shelter of which several\r\nhundred Dervishes, surprised by the sudden arrival of the troops,\r\nwere scampering. Beyond the island, on the tall tree-clad cliff of the\r\nfurther bank, other minute figures moved and bustled. The discordant\r\nsound of horns and drums floating across the waters, and the unfurling\r\nof many bright flags, proclaimed the presence and the intention of the\r\nhostile force.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish position was well chosen and of great defensive strength. A\r\nlittle to the north of Dakhila the Blue Nile bifurcates--one rapid but\r\nshallow stream flowing fairly straight under the east bank; another very\r\ndeep stream running in a wide curve under the west bank, cutting into\r\nit so that it is precipitous. These two branches of the river enclose\r\nan island a mile and a quarter long by 1,400 yards wide, and on this\r\nisland, surrounded by a natural moat of swiftly flowing water, was the\r\nDervish dem. The western side of the island rose into a line of low\r\nsandhills covered with scrub and grass, with a steep reverse slope\r\ntowards the foreshore of the river-bank; and here, in this excellent\r\ncover, what eventually proved to be three-quarters of the force of Ahmed\r\nFedil were drawn up. Backed against the deep arm of the river they\r\nhad no choice, nor indeed any other wish, but to fight. Before them\r\nstretched a bare slope of heavy shingle, 1,000 yards wide, over\r\nwhich their enemies must advance to the attack, Behind them the high\r\nprecipitous west bank of the river, which rose in some places to a\r\nheight of fifty feet, was lined with the 300 riflemen who had already\r\ncrossed; and from this secure position Ahmed Fedil and four of his Emirs\r\nwere able to watch, assist, and direct the defence of the island. The\r\nforce on the island was under the sole command of the Emir Saadalla, of\r\nGedaref repute; but, besides his own followers, most of the men of the\r\nfour other Emirs were concentrated there.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was uninviting. Colonel Lewis discovered that he had\r\nabsurdly under-rated the strength and discipline of the Dervish force.\r\nIt had been continually reported that the defeats at Gedaref had\r\ndemoralised them, and that their numbers did not exceed 2,000 men.\r\nMoreover, he had marched to the attack in the belief that they were\r\nequally divided on both sides of the river. Retreat was, however,\r\nimpossible. Strong as was the position of the enemy, formidable as was\r\ntheir strength, the direct assault was actually safer than a retirement\r\nthrough the nineteen miles of gloomy forest which lay between the\r\nadventurous column and Rosaires. The British officer immediately\r\ndetermined to engage. At nine o'clock the two Maxims, which represented\r\nthe artillery of the little force, came into action in good positions,\r\nwhile the Xth Soudanese and most of the irregulars lined the east bank.\r\nMusketry and Maxim fire was now opened at long range. The Dervishes\r\nreplied, and as the smoke of their rifles gradually revealed their\r\nposition and their numbers, it soon became evident that no long-range\r\nfire could dislodge them; and Colonel Lewis resolved, in spite of the\r\ngreat disparity of force and disadvantage of ground, to attack them with\r\nthe bayonet. Some time was spent in finding fords across the interposing\r\narm of the river, and it was not until past ten o'clock that Bakr's\r\nmen crossed on to the island, and, supported by a company of the Xth\r\nSoudanese, advanced towards the enemy's right and took up a position at\r\nabout 800 yards from their line, to cover the rest of the passage.\r\n\r\nColonel Lewis now determined to turn the enemy's left from the north,\r\nattack them in flank, and roll them into the deep part of the river.\r\nWith the Xth Soudanese, under Colonel Nason and Major Fergusson, he\r\nmarched northwards along the river's edge, sheltering as far as possible\r\nunder the curve of the bank from the fire, which now began to cause\r\ncasualties. Having reached the position from which it was determined\r\nto deliver the attack, the battalion deployed into line, and, changing\r\nfront half left, advanced obliquely by alternate companies across the\r\nbare shingle towards the sandhills. As they advanced, a galling fire was\r\nopened upon the left flank by two hundred Dervishes admirably placed on\r\na knoll. Major Fergusson was detached with one company to dislodge them.\r\nThe remaining four companies continued the attack.\r\n\r\nThe Dervish musketry now became intense. The whole front of the island\r\nposition was lined with smoke, and behind it, from the high cliff of\r\nthe west bank, a long half-circle of riflemen directed a second tier\r\nof converging bullets upon the 400 charging men. The shingle jumped and\r\nstirred in all directions as it was struck. A hideous whistling filled\r\nthe air. The Soudanese began to drop on all sides, 'just like the\r\nDervishes at Omdurman,' and the ground was soon dotted with the bodies\r\nof the killed and wounded. 'We did not,' said an officer, 'dare to\r\nlook back.' But undaunted by fire and cross-fire, the heroic black\r\nsoldiers--demons who would not be denied--pressed forward without the\r\nslightest check or hesitation, and, increasing their pace to a swift run\r\nin their eagerness to close with the enemy, reached the first sandhills\r\nand found cover beneath them. A quarter of the battalion had already\r\nfallen, and lay strewn on the shingle.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of their advance had exhausted the Soudanese, and Lewis\r\nordered Nason to halt under cover of the sandhills for a few minutes,\r\nso that the soldiers might get their breath before the final effort.\r\nThereupon the Dervishes, seeing that the troops were no longer\r\nadvancing, and believing that the attack was repulsed, resolved to\r\nclinch the matter. Ahmed Fedil from the west bank sounded the charge on\r\ndrum and bugle, and with loud shouts of triumph and enthusiasm the whole\r\nforce on the island rose from among the upper sandhills, and, waving\r\ntheir banners, advanced impetuously in counter-attack. But the Xth\r\nSoudanese, panting yet unconquerable, responded to the call of their\r\ntwo white officers, and, crowning the little dunes behind which they had\r\nsheltered, met the exultant enemy with a withering fire and a responding\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nThe range was short and the fire effective. The astonished Arabs wavered\r\nand broke; and then the soldiers, nobly led, swept forward in a\r\nlong scattered line and drove the enemy from one sandy ridge to\r\nanother--drove them across the rolling and uneven ground, every fold of\r\nwhich contained Dervishes--drove them steadily back over the sandhills,\r\nuntil all who were not killed or wounded were penned at the extreme\r\nsouthern end of the island, with the deep unfordable arm of the river\r\nbehind them and the fierce black soldiers, roused to fury by their\r\nlosses, in front.\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh Bakr, with his men and the rest of the irregulars, joined the\r\nvictorious Soudanese, and from the cover of the sandhills, now in the\r\nhands of the troops, a terrible fire was opened upon the Dervishes\r\ncrowded together on the bare and narrow promontory and on the foreshore.\r\nSome tried to swim across the rushing river to their friends on the west\r\nbank. Many were drowned--among them Saadalla, who sank horse and man\r\nbeneath the flood. Others took refuge from the fire by standing up\r\nto their necks in the stream. The greater part, however, escaped to a\r\nsmaller island a little further up the river. But the cover was bad,\r\nthe deep water prevented further flight, and, after being exposed for\r\nan hour and a half to the musketry of two companies, the survivors--300\r\nstrong--surrendered.\r\n\r\nBy 11.30 the whole island was in the possession of the troops. It was,\r\nhowever, still swept and commanded by the fire from the west bank. The\r\ncompany which had been detached to subdue the Dervish riflemen were\r\nthemselves pinned behind their scanty cover. Major Fergusson was\r\nseverely wounded and a third of his men were hit. To withdraw this\r\ncompany and the wounded was a matter of great difficulty; and it was\r\nnecessary to carry the Maxims across the river and bring them into\r\naction at 400 yards. Firing ceased at last at three o'clock, and the\r\nvictors were left to measure their losses and their achievement.\r\n\r\nThere was neither time nor opportunity to count the enemy's dead, but\r\nit is certain that at least 500 Arabs were killed on the island. Two\r\nthousand one hundred and twenty-seven fighting men and several hundred\r\nwomen and children surrendered. Five hundred and seventy-six rifles,\r\nlarge quantities of ammunition, and a huge pile of spears and swords\r\nwere captured. Ahmed Fedil, indeed, escaped with a numerous following\r\nacross the Ghezira, but so disheartened were the Dervishes by this\r\ncrushing defeat that the whole force surrendered to the gunboat Metemma\r\nat Reng, on the White Nile, on the 22nd of January, and their leader was\r\ncontent to fly with scarcely a dozen followers to join the Khalifa.\r\n\r\nThe casualties among the troops in the action amounted to 41 killed and\r\n145 wounded, including Major Fergusson; and the Xth Soudanese, on whom\r\nthe brunt of the fighting fell, suffered a loss of 25 non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men killed, 1 British officer, 6 native officers, and 117\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men wounded, out of a total strength of\r\n511. The rest of the loss was among the irregulars, 495 of whom took\r\npart in the engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX: THE END OF THE KHALIFA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the operations described in the last chapter, the whole of the\r\nregions bordering on the Niles were cleared of hostile forces, dotted\r\nwith military posts, and brought back to Egyptian authority. The\r\nKhalifa, however, still remained in Kordofan. After he had made good\r\nhis escape from the battlefield of Omdurman, Abdullah had hurried in the\r\ndirection of El Obeid, moving by the wells of Shat and Zeregia, which\r\nat that season of the year were full of water after the rains. At Abu\r\nSherai, having shaken off the pursuit of the friendlies, he halted,\r\nencamped, and busily set to work to reorganise his shattered forces. How\r\nfar he succeeded in this will presently be apparent. In the beginning\r\nof November the general drying-up of the country turned the wells at\r\nAbu Sherai into pools of mud, and the Khalifa moved westward to Aigaila.\r\nHere he was joined by the Emir El Khatem with the El Obeid garrison.\r\nThis chief and his followers had never been engaged with the 'Turks,'\r\nand were consequently fresh and valiant. Their arrival greatly\r\nencouraged the force which the Khalifa had rallied. A large dem was\r\nformed at Aigaila, and here, since the water was plentiful during\r\nDecember, Abdullah abode quietly, sending his raiding parties far afield\r\nto collect grain and other supplies.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Sirdar, who had returned from England, received the news\r\nof the success at Rosaires he determined to make an attempt to capture\r\nthe Khalifa; and on the 29th of December sent for Colonel Kitchener,\r\nto whom as the senior available officer he had decided to entrust this\r\nhonourable enterprise. The colonel was directed to take a small\r\nmixed force into Kordofan and to reconnoitre the enemy's position. If\r\npossible, he was to attack and capture Abdullah, whose followers were\r\nbelieved not to exceed 1,000 ill-armed men. The 'Kordofan Field Force,'\r\nas its officers called it, was formed as follows:\r\n\r\n Commanding: COLONEL KITCHENER\r\n\r\n  Assistant Adjutant-General: LIEUT.-COLONEL MITFORD\r\n\r\n  Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General: MAJOR WILLIAMS\r\n\r\n   Troops:\r\n\r\n    Two squadrons Egyptian Cavalry\r\n    2nd Egyptians\r\n    XIVth Soudanese\r\n    Two galloping Maxims\r\n    Two mule guns\r\n    One company Camel Corps.\r\n\r\nCamel transport was drawn from the Atbara and from the Blue Nile. The\r\ntroops were conveyed by steamer to Duem, and concentrated there during\r\nthe first week in 1899. The camels were collected at Kawa, and, although\r\nseveral of the convoys had to march as much as 400 miles, the whole\r\nnumber had arrived by the 10th of January.\r\n\r\nThe prime difficulty of the operation was the want of water. The\r\nKhalifa's position was nearly 125 miles from the river. The intervening\r\ncountry is, in the wet season, dotted with shallow lakes, but by January\r\nthese are reduced to mud puddles and only occasional pools remain.\r\nAll the water needed by the men, horses, and mules of the column must\r\ntherefore be carried. The camels must go thirsty until one of the\r\nrare pools--the likely places for which were known to the native\r\nguides--might be found. Now, the capacity of a camel for endurance\r\nwithout drinking is famous; but it has its limits. If he start\r\nhaving filled himself with water, he can march for five days without\r\nrefreshment. If he then have another long drink, he can continue for\r\nfive days more. But this strains his power to the extreme; he suffers\r\nacutely during the journey, and probably dies at its end. In war,\r\nhowever, the miseries of animals cannot be considered; their capacity\r\nfor work alone concerns the commander. It was thought that, partly by\r\nthe water carried in skins, partly by the drying-up pools, and partly by\r\nthe camel's power of endurance, it might be just possible for a force of\r\nabout 1,200 men to strike out 125 miles into the desert, to have\r\nthree days to do their business in, and to come back to the Nile. This\r\noperation, which has been called the Shirkela Reconnaissance, occupied\r\nthe Kordofan Field Force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the route from Kohi was considered encouraging. At Gedid\r\nthe old wells promised sufficient water to refill the skins, and within\r\nseven miles of the wells were two large pools at which the camels could\r\nbe watered. The column, therefore, prepared for the journey. Nothing was\r\nneglected which could increase the water carried or diminish the number\r\nof drinkers. Only twelve cavalry were taken. The horses of the Maxim\r\nguns and the mules of the battery were reduced to the lowest possible\r\nnumber. Every person, animal, or thing not vitally necessary was\r\nremorselessly excluded. In order to lighten the loads and make room for\r\nmore water, even the ammunition was limited to 100 rounds per rifle.\r\nThe daily consumption of water was restricted to one pint for men, six\r\ngallons for horses, and five for mules. To lessen the thirst caused by\r\nthe heat Colonel Kitchener decided to march by night. An advanced depot\r\nwas formed at Gedid and food for two days accumulated there. Besides\r\nthis, each unit carried ten, and the column transport seven, days'\r\nrations. Thus the force were supplied with food up till the 9th of\r\nFebruary, and their radius of action, except as restricted by water, was\r\nnineteen days. This was further extended five days by the arrangement\r\nof a convoy which was to set out on the 30th of January to meet them as\r\nthey returned.\r\n\r\nThe column--numbering 1,604 officers and men and 1,624 camels and other\r\nbeasts of burden--started from Kohi at 3 P.M. on the 23rd of January,\r\nhaving sent on a small advanced party to the wells of Gedid twelve hours\r\nbefore. The country through which their route lay was of barren and\r\nmiserable aspect. They had embarked on a sandy ocean with waves of\r\nthorny scrub and withered grass. From the occasional rocky ridges,\r\nwhich allowed a more extended view, this sterile jungle could be seen\r\nstretching indefinitely on all sides. Ten miles from the river all\r\nvestiges of animal life disappeared. The land was a desert; not the open\r\ndesert of the Northern Soudan, but one vast unprofitable thicket, whose\r\ninterlacing thorn bushes, unable to yield the slightest nourishment to\r\nliving creatures, could yet obstruct their path.\r\n\r\nThrough this the straggling column, headed in the daylight by the red\r\nEgyptian flag and at night by a lantern on a pole, wound its weary way,\r\nthe advanced guard cutting a path with axes and marking the track\r\nwith strips of calico, the rearguard driving on the laggard camels\r\nand picking up the numerous loads which were cast. Three long marches\r\nbrought them on the 25th to Gedid. The first detachment had already\r\narrived and had opened up the wells. None gave much water; all emitted\r\na foul stench, and one was occupied by a poisonous serpent eight feet\r\nlong--the sole inhabitant. The camels were sent to drink at the pool\r\nseven miles away, and it was hoped that some of the water-skins could\r\nbe refilled; but, after all, the green slime was thought unfit for human\r\nconsumption, and they had to come back empty.\r\n\r\nThe march was resumed on the 26th. The trees were now larger; the\r\nscrub became a forest; the sandy soil changed to a dark red colour; but\r\notherwise the character of the country was unaltered. The column rested\r\nat Abu Rokba. A few starving inhabitants who occupied the huts pointed\r\nout the grave of the Khalifa's father and the little straw house in\r\nwhich Abdullah was wont to pray during his visits. Lately, they said, he\r\nhad retired from Aigaila to Shirkela, but even from this latter place he\r\nhad made frequent pilgrimages.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the next march, which was made by day, the guides, whose\r\nmemories had been refreshed by flogging, discovered a large pool of good\r\nwater, and all drank deeply in thankful joy. A small but strong zeriba\r\nwas built near this precious pool, and the reserve food and a few sick\r\nmen were left with a small garrison under an Egyptian officer. The\r\ncolumn resumed their journey. On the 29th they reached Aigaila, and\r\nhere, with feelings of astonishment scarcely less than Robinson Crusoe\r\nexperienced at seeing the footprint in the sand, they came upon the\r\nKhalifa's abandoned camp. A wide space had been cleared of bush, and\r\nthe trees, stripped of their smaller branches, presented an uncanny\r\nappearance. Beyond stood the encampment--a great multitude of yellow\r\nspear-grass dwellings, perfectly clean, neatly arranged in streets and\r\nsquares, and stretching for miles. The aspect of this strange deserted\r\ntown, rising, silent as a cemetery, out of the awful scrub, chilled\r\neveryone who saw it. Its size might indeed concern their leader. At\r\nthe very lowest computation it had contained 20,000 people. How many of\r\nthese were fighting men? Certainly not fewer than 8,000 or 9,000. Yet\r\nthe expedition had been sent on the assumption that there were scarcely\r\n1,000 warriors with the Khalifa!\r\n\r\nObserving every precaution of war, the column crawled forward, and the\r\ncavalry and Camel Corps, who covered the advance, soon came in contact\r\nwith the enemy's scouts. Shots were exchanged and the Arabs retreated.\r\nThe column halted three miles to the east of this position, and, forming\r\na strong zeriba, passed the night in expectation of an attack. Nothing,\r\nhowever, happened, and at dawn Mitford was sent out with some mounted\r\n'friendlies' to reconnoitre. At ten o'clock he returned, and his report\r\nconfirmed the conclusions which had been drawn from the size of the\r\nAigaila camp. Creeping forward to a good point of view, the officer had\r\nseen the Dervish flags lining the crest of the hill. From their number,\r\nthe breadth of front covered, and the numerous figures of men moving\r\nabout them, he estimated not fewer than 2,000 Arab riflemen in the\r\nfront line. How many more were in reserve it was impossible to say.\r\nThe position was, moreover, of great strength, being surrounded by deep\r\nravines and pools of water.\r\n\r\nThe news was startling. The small force were 125 miles from their base;\r\nbehind them lay an almost waterless country, and in front was a powerful\r\nenemy. An informal council of war was held. The Sirdar had distinctly\r\nordered that, whatever happened, there was to be no waiting; the troops\r\nwere either to attack or retire. Colonel Kitchener decided to retire.\r\nThe decision having been taken, the next step was to get beyond the\r\nenemy's reach as quickly as possible, and the force began their retreat\r\non the same night. The homeward march was not less long and trying than\r\nthe advance, and neither hopes of distinction nor glamour of excitement\r\ncheered the weary soldiers. As they toiled gloomily back towards the\r\nNile, the horror of the accursed land grew upon all. Hideous spectacles\r\nof human misery were added to the desolation of the hot, thorny scrub\r\nand stinking pools of mud. The starving inhabitants had been lured from\r\ntheir holes and corners by the outward passage of the troops, and hoped\r\nto snatch some food from the field of battle. Disappointed, they\r\nnow approached the camps at night in twos and threes, making piteous\r\nentreaties for any kind of nourishment. Their appeals were perforce\r\nunregarded; not an ounce of spare food remained.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the journey the camels, terribly strained by their\r\nprivation of water, began to die, and it was evident that the force\r\nwould have no time to spare. One young camel, though not apparently\r\nexhausted, refused to proceed, and even when a fire was lighted round\r\nhim remained stubborn and motionless; so that, after being terribly\r\nscorched, he had to be shot. Others fell and died all along the route.\r\nTheir deaths brought some relief to the starving inhabitants. For as\r\neach animal was left behind, the officers, looking back, might see first\r\none, then another furtive figure emerge from the bush and pounce on\r\nthe body like a vulture; and in many cases before life was extinct the\r\nfamished natives were devouring the flesh.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February the column reached Kohi, and the Kordofan Field\r\nForce, having overcome many difficulties and suffered many hardships,\r\nwas broken up, unsuccessful through no fault of its commander, its\r\nofficers, or its men.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year no further operations were undertaken against the\r\nKhalifa, and he remained all through the spring and summer of 1899\r\nsupreme in Kordofan, reorganising his adherents and plundering the\r\ncountry--a chronic danger to the new Government, a curse to the local\r\ninhabitants, and a most serious element of unrest. The barren and almost\r\nwaterless regions into which he had withdrawn presented very difficult\r\nobstacles to any military expedition, and although powerful forces\r\nwere still concentrated at Khartoum, the dry season and the uncertain\r\nwhereabouts of the enemy prevented action. But towards the end of August\r\ntrustworthy information was received by the Intelligence Department,\r\nthrough the agency of friendly tribesmen, that the Khalifa, with all\r\nhis army, was encamped at Jebel Gedir--that same mountain in Southern\r\nKordofan to which nearly twenty years before he and the Mahdi had\r\nretreated after the flight from Abba Island. Here among old memories\r\nwhich his presence revived he became at once a centre of fanaticism.\r\nNight after night he slept upon the Mahdi's stone; and day after\r\nday tales of his dreams were carried by secret emissaries not only\r\nthroughout the Western Soudan, but into the Ghezira and even to\r\nKhartoum. And now, his position being definite and his action highly\r\ndangerous, it was decided to move against him.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of October the first Soudanese battalion was despatched in\r\nsteamers from Khartoum, and by the 19th a force of some 7,000 men, well\r\nequipped with camel transport, was concentrated at Kaka, a village on\r\nthe White Nile not far north of Fashoda. The distance from here to\r\nJebel Gedir was about eighty miles, and as for the first fifty no water\r\nexisted; the whole supply had to be carried in tanks. Sir Reginald\r\nWingate, who was in command of the infantry, reached Fungor, thirty\r\nmiles from the enemy's position, with the two leading battalions (IXth\r\nand Xth Soudanese) on the 23rd of October, only to find news that the\r\nKhalifa had left his camp at Jebel Gedir on the 18th and had receded\r\nindefinitely into the desert. The cast having failed, and further\r\nprogress involving a multiplication of difficulties, Lord Kitchener,\r\nwho was at Kaka, stopped the operations, and the whole of the\r\ntroops returned to Khartoum, which they reached in much vexation and\r\ndisappointment on the 1st of November.\r\n\r\nIt was at first universally believed that the Khalifa's intention was\r\nto retire to an almost inaccessible distance--to El Obeid or Southern\r\nDarfur--and the officers of the Egyptian army passed an unhappy\r\nfortnight reading the Ladysmith telegrams and accusing their evil\r\nfortune which kept them so far from the scene of action. But soon\r\nstrange rumours began to run about the bazaars of Omdurman of buried\r\nweapons and whispers of revolt. For a few days a vague feeling of unrest\r\npervaded the native city, and then suddenly on the 12th of November came\r\nprecise and surprising news. The Khalifa was not retreating to the south\r\nor to the west, but advancing northward with Omdurman, not El Obeid, as\r\nhis object. Emboldened by the spectacle of two successive expeditions\r\nretreating abortive, and by, who shall say what wild exaggerated tales\r\nof disasters to the Turks far beyond the limits of the Soudan, Abdullah\r\nhad resolved to stake all that yet remained to him in one last desperate\r\nattempt to recapture his former capital; and so, upon the 12th of\r\nNovember, his advanced guard, under the Emir Ahmed Fedil, struck the\r\nNile opposite Abba Island, and audaciously fired volleys of musketry at\r\nthe gunboat Sultan which was patrolling the river.\r\n\r\nThe name of Abba Island may perhaps carry the reader back to the very\r\nbeginning of this story. Here, eighteen years before, the Mahdi had\r\nlived and prayed after his quarrel with the haughty Sheikh; here\r\nAbdullah had joined him; here the flag of the revolt had been set up,\r\nand the first defeat had been inflicted upon the Egyptian troops; and\r\nhere, too, still dwelt--dwells, indeed, to this day--one of those same\r\nbrothers who had pursued through all the vicissitudes and convulsions\r\nwhich had shaken the Soudan his humble industry of building wooden\r\nboats. It is surely a curious instance of the occasional symmetry of\r\nhistory that final destruction should have befallen the last remains of\r\nthe Mahdist movement so close to the scene of its origin!\r\n\r\nThe news which had reached Khartoum set all wheels in motion. The IXth\r\nand XIIIth Soudanese Battalions were mobilised on the 13th of November\r\nand despatched at once to Abba Island under Colonel Lewis. Kitchener\r\nhurried south from Cairo, and arrived in Khartoum on the 18th. A field\r\nforce of some 2,300 troops--one troop of cavalry, the 2nd Field\r\nBattery, the 1st Maxim Battery, the Camel Corps, IXth Soudanese, XIIIth\r\nSoudanese, and one company 2nd Egyptians--was immediately formed, and\r\nthe command entrusted to Sir Reginald Wingate. There were besides some\r\n900 Arab riflemen and a few irregular mounted scouts. On the 20th\r\nthese troops were concentrated at Fashi Shoya, whence Colonel Lewis had\r\nobliged Ahmed Fedil to withdraw, and at 3.30 on the afternoon of the\r\n21st the expedition started in a south-westerly direction upon the track\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe troops bivouacked some ten miles south-west of Fashi Shoya, and\r\nthen marched in bright moonlight to Nefisa, encountering only a Dervish\r\npatrol of about ten men. At Nefisa was found the evacuated camp of Ahmed\r\nFedil, containing a quantity of grain which he had collected from the\r\nriverain district, and, what was of more value, a sick but intelligent\r\nDervish who stated that the Emir had just moved to Abu Aadel, five miles\r\nfurther on. This information was soon confirmed by Mahmud Hussein,\r\nan Egyptian officer, who with an irregular patrol advanced boldly in\r\nreconnaissance. The infantry needed a short rest to eat a little food,\r\nand Sir Reginald Wingate ordered Colonel Mahon to press on immediately\r\nwith the whole of the mounted troops and engage the enemy, so as to\r\nprevent him retreating before an action could be forced.\r\n\r\nAccordingly cavalry, Camel Corps, Maxims, and irregulars--whose\r\nfleetness of foot enabled them, though not mounted, to keep pace with\r\nthe rest--set off at their best pace: and after them at 9.15 hurried the\r\ninfantry, refreshed by a drink at the water tanks and a hasty meal.\r\nAs they advanced the scrub became denser, and all were in broken and\r\nobstructed ground when, at about ten o'clock, the sound of Maxim firing\r\nand the patter of musketry proclaimed that Mahon had come into contact.\r\nThe firing soon became more rapid, and as the infantry approached it was\r\nevident that the mounted troops were briskly engaged. The position which\r\nthey occupied was a low ridge which rose a little above the level of the\r\nplain and was comparatively bare of scrub; from this it was possible\r\nat a distance of 800 yards to overlook the Dervish encampment huddled\r\naround the water pools. It was immediately evident that the infantry and\r\nthe battery were arriving none too soon. The Dervishes, who had hitherto\r\ncontented themselves with maintaining a ragged and desultory fire from\r\nthe scrub, now sallied forth into the open and delivered a most bold and\r\ndetermined charge upon the guns. The intervening space was little\r\nmore than 200 yards, and for a moment the attack looked as if it might\r\nsucceed. But upon the instant the IXth and XIIIth Soudanese, who had\r\nbeen doubled steadily for upwards of two miles, came into line,\r\nfilling the gap between Mahon's guns and dismounted Camel Corps and the\r\nirregular riflemen; and so the converging fire of the whole force was\r\nbrought to bear upon the enemy--now completely beaten and demoralised.\r\nTwo Dervishes, brothers, bound together hand and foot, perished in\r\nvaliant comradeship ninety-five paces from the line of guns. Many were\r\nslain, and the remainder fled. The whole Egyptian line now advanced upon\r\nthe encampment hard upon the tracks of the retreating enemy, who were\r\nseen emerging from the scrub on to a grassy plain more than a mile away,\r\nacross which and further for a distance of five miles they were pursued\r\nby the cavalry and the Camel Corps. Three hundred and twenty corpses\r\nwere counted, and at least an equal number must have been wounded. Ahmed\r\nFedil and one or two of his principal Emirs escaped to the southward\r\nand to the Khalifa. The Egyptian loss amounted to five men wounded. The\r\ntroops bivouacked in square formation, at about four o'clock, near the\r\nscene of action.\r\n\r\nA question of considerable difficulty and some anxiety now arose. It was\r\nlearned from the prisoners that the Khalifa, with about 5,000 fighting\r\nmen, was moving northwards towards the wells of Gedid, of which we\r\nhave already heard in the Shirkela reconnaissance, and which were some\r\ntwenty-five miles from the scene of the fight. The troops were already\r\nfatigued by their severe exertions. The water pool was so foul that even\r\nthe thirsty camels refused to drink of it, and moreover scarcely any\r\nwater remained in the tanks. It was therefore of vital importance to\r\nreach the wells of Gedid. But supposing exhausted troops famishing for\r\nwater reached them only to be confronted by a powerful Dervish force\r\nalready in possession! Sir Reginald Wingate decided, however, to face\r\nthe risk, and at a few minutes before midnight the column set out again\r\non its road. The ground was broken; the night was sultry: and as the\r\nhours passed by the sufferings of the infantry began to be most acute.\r\nMany piteous appeals were made for water. All had perforce to be refused\r\nby the commander, who dared not diminish by a mouthful his slender store\r\nuntil he knew the true situation at Gedid. In these circumstances the\r\ninfantry, in spite of their admirable patience, became very restive.\r\nMany men fell exhausted to the ground; and it was with a feeling of\r\nimmense relief that at nine o'clock on the morning of the 24th news\r\nwas received from the cavalry that the wells had been occupied by them\r\nwithout opposition. All the water in the tanks was at once distributed,\r\nand thus refreshed the infantry struggled on and settled down at midday\r\naround a fine pool of comparatively pure water.\r\n\r\nAt Gedid, as at Nefisa, a single Dervish, and this time a sullen fellow,\r\nwas captured, and from him it was learned that the Khalifa's army\r\nwas encamped seven miles to the south-east. It was now clear that his\r\nposition was strategically most unfavourable. His route to the north\r\nwas barred; his retreat to the south lay through waterless and densely\r\nwooded districts; and as the seizure of the grain supplies which had\r\nresulted from Fedil's foraging excursions rendered his advance or\r\nretirement a matter of difficulty, it seemed probable he would stand.\r\nWingate, therefore, decided to attack him at dawn. Leaving the transport\r\nunder guard by the water with instructions to follow at four o'clock,\r\nthe troops moved off at midnight, screened in front at a distance of\r\nhalf a mile by the cavalry and their flanks protected by the Camel\r\nCorps. The road was in places so thickly wooded that a path had to be\r\ncut by the infantry pioneers and the artillery. At three o'clock, when\r\nabout three miles from the enemy's position, the force was deployed into\r\nfighting formation. The irregular riflemen covered the front; behind\r\nthem the XIIIth and IXth Soudanese; and behind these, again, the Maxims\r\nand the artillery were disposed. Cautiously and silently the advance was\r\nresumed, and now in the distance the beating of war drums and the long\r\nbooming note of the Khalifa's horn broke on the stillness, proclaiming\r\nthat the enemy were not unprepared. At a few minutes before four o'clock\r\nanother low ridge, also comparatively bare of scrub, was reached and\r\noccupied as a position. The cavalry were now withdrawn from the front,\r\na few infantry picquets were thrown out, and the rest of the force lay\r\ndown in the long grass of the little ridge and waited for daylight.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour the sky to the eastward began to grow paler with the\r\npromise of the morning and in the indistinct light the picquets could\r\nbe seen creeping gradually in; while behind them along the line of the\r\ntrees faint white figures, barely distinguishable, began to accumulate.\r\nSir Reginald Wingate, fearing lest a sudden rush should be made\r\nupon him, now ordered the whole force to stand up and open fire; and\r\nforthwith, in sudden contrast to the silence and obscurity, a loud\r\ncrackling fusillade began. It was immediately answered. The enemy's\r\nfire flickered along a wide half-circle and developed continually\r\nwith greater vigour opposite the Egyptian left, which was consequently\r\nreinforced. As the light improved, large bodies of shouting Dervishes\r\nwere seen advancing; but the fire was too hot, and their Emirs were\r\nunable to lead them far beyond the edge of the wood. So soon as this was\r\nperceived Wingate ordered a general advance; and the whole force, moving\r\nat a rapid pace down the gentle slope, drove the enemy through the trees\r\ninto the camp about a mile and a half away. Here, huddled together under\r\ntheir straw shelters, 6,000 women and children were collected, all of\r\nwhom, with many unwounded combatants, made signals of surrender and\r\nappeals for mercy. The 'cease fire' was sounded at half-past six.\r\nThen, and not till then, was it discovered how severe the loss of the\r\nDervishes had been. It seemed to the officers that, short as was the\r\nrange, the effect of rifle fire under such unsatisfactory conditions of\r\nlight could not have been very great. But the bodies thickly scattered\r\nin the scrub were convincing evidences. In one space not much more\r\nthan a score of yards square lay all the most famous Emirs of the\r\nonce far-reaching Dervish domination. The Khalifa Abdullah, pierced by\r\nseveral balls, was stretched dead on his sheepskin; on his right\r\nlay Ali-Wad-Helu, on his left Ahmed Fedil. Before them was a line of\r\nlifeless bodyguards; behind them a score of less important chiefs; and\r\nbehind these, again, a litter of killed and wounded horses. Such was the\r\ngrim spectacle which in the first light of the morning met the eyes\r\nof the British officers, to some of whom it meant the conclusion of\r\na perilous task prolonged over many years. And while they looked in\r\nastonishment not unmingled with awe, there scrambled unhurt from under\r\na heap of bodies the little Emir Yunes, of Dongola, who added the few\r\nlinks necessary to complete the chain.\r\n\r\nAt Omdurman Abdullah had remained mounted behind the hill of Surgham,\r\nbut in this his last fight he had set himself in the forefront of the\r\nbattle. Almost at the first discharge, his son Osman, the Sheikh-ed-Din,\r\nwas wounded, and as he was carried away he urged the Khalifa to save\r\nhimself by flight; but the latter, with a dramatic dignity sometimes\r\ndenied to more civilised warriors, refused. Dismounting from his\r\nhorse, and ordering his Emirs to imitate him, he seated himself on his\r\nsheepskin and there determined to await the worst of fortune. And so it\r\ncame to pass that in this last scene in the struggle with Mahdism the\r\nstage was cleared of all its striking characters, and Osman Digna alone\r\npurchased by flight a brief ignoble liberty, soon to be followed by a\r\nlong ignoble servitude.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine Emirs, 3,000 fighting men, 6,000 women and children\r\nsurrendered themselves prisoners. The Egyptian losses were three killed\r\nand twenty-three wounded.\r\n\r\n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nThe long story now approaches its conclusion. The River War is over. In\r\nits varied course, which extended over fourteen years and involved\r\nthe untimely destruction of perhaps 300,000 lives, many extremes and\r\ncontrasts have been displayed. There have been battles which were\r\nmassacres, and others that were mere parades. There have been occasions\r\nof shocking cowardice and surprising heroism, of plans conceived in\r\nhaste and emergency, of schemes laid with slow deliberation, of wild\r\nextravagance and cruel waste, of economies scarcely less barbarous, of\r\nwisdom and incompetence. But the result is at length achieved, and the\r\nflags of England and Egypt wave unchallenged over the valley of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nAt what cost were such advantages obtained? The reader must judge for\r\nhimself of the loss in men; yet while he deplores the deaths of brave\r\nofficers and soldiers, and no less the appalling destruction of the\r\nvaliant Arabs, he should remember that such slaughter is inseparable\r\nfrom war, and that, if the war be justified, the loss of life cannot\r\nbe accused. But I write of the cost in money, and the economy of the\r\ncampaigns cannot be better displayed than by the table below:\r\n\r\n Railway: £E 1,181,372\r\n Telegraph: £E 21,825\r\n Gunboats: £E 154,934\r\n Military Expenditure: £E 996,223\r\n   TOTAL EXPENDITURES: £E 2,354,354 (£E1 = £1 0s.6d.)\r\n\r\nFor something less than two and a half millions sterling active military\r\noperations were carried on for nearly three years, involving the\r\nemployment--far from its base--of an army of 25,000 disciplined troops,\r\nincluding an expensive British contingent of 8,000 men, and ending\r\nin the utter defeat of an enemy whose armed forces numbered at the\r\nbeginning of the war upwards of 80,000 soldiers, and the reconquest and\r\nre-occupation of a territory measuring sixteen hundred miles from north\r\nto south and twelve hundred from east to west [Lieut.-Colonel Stewart's\r\nReport: Egypt, No.11, 1883], which at one time supported at least twenty\r\nmillions of inhabitants. But this is not all. Of the total £E2,354,354\r\nonly £E996,223 can be accounted as military expenditure. For the\r\nremaining £E1,358,131 Egypt possesses 500 miles of railway, 900 miles of\r\ntelegraph, and a flotilla of steamers. The railway will not, indeed, pay\r\na great return upon the capital invested, but it will immediately pay\r\nsomething, and may ultimately pay much. The telegraph is as necessary as\r\nthe railway to the development of the country; it costs far less, and,\r\nwhen the Egyptian system is connected with the South African, it will\r\nbe a sure source of revenue. Lastly, there are the gunboats. The reader\r\ncannot have any doubts as to the value of these vessels during the\r\nwar. Never was money better spent on military plant. Now that the\r\nriver operations are over the gunboats discharge the duties of ordinary\r\nsteamers; and although they are, of course, expensive machines for goods\r\nand passenger traffic, they are by no means inefficient. The movement of\r\nthe troops, their extra pay, the supplies at the end of a long line of\r\ncommunications, the ammunition, the loss by wear and tear of uniforms\r\nand accoutrements, the correspondence, the rewards, all cost together\r\nless than a million sterling; and for that million Egypt has recovered\r\nthe Soudan.\r\n\r\nThe whole £E2,354,354 had, however, to be paid during the campaigns.\r\nTowards this sum Great Britain advanced, as has been related, £800,000\r\nas a loan; and this was subsequently converted into a gift. The cost to\r\nthe British taxpayer of the recovery and part acquisition of the Soudan,\r\nof the military prestige, and of the indulgence of the sentiment known\r\nas 'the avenging of Gordon' has therefore been £800,000; and it may\r\nbe stated in all seriousness that English history does not record\r\nany instance of so great a national satisfaction being more cheaply\r\nobtained. The rest of the money has been provided by Egypt; and this\r\nstrange country, seeming to resemble the camel, on which so much of her\r\nwealth depends, has, in default of the usual sources of supply, drawn\r\nupon some fifth stomach for nourishment, and, to the perplexity even of\r\nthose best acquainted with her amazing financial constitution, has stood\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\n'The extraordinary expenditure in connection with the Soudan campaign,'\r\nwrote Mr. J.L. Gorst, the Financial Adviser to the Khedive in his Note\r\nof December 20, 1898 [Note by the Financial Adviser on the Budget of\r\n1899: EGYPT, No. 3, 1899], 'has been charged to the Special Reserve\r\nFund. At the present moment this fund shows a deficit of £E336,000, and\r\nthere are outstanding charges on account of the expedition amounting to\r\n£E330,000, making a total deficit of £E666,000.'\r\n\r\n'On the other hand, the fund will be increased, when the accounts of the\r\nyear are made up, by a sum of £E382,000, being the balance of the share\r\nof the Government in the surplus of 1898, after deduction of the excess\r\nadministrative expenditure in that year, and by a sum of £E90,000, being\r\npart of the proceeds of the sale of the Khedivial postal steamers. The\r\nnet deficit will, therefore, be £E194,000; and if the year 1899 is as\r\nprosperous as the present year, it may be hoped that the deficit will\r\ndisappear when the accounts of 1899 are closed.'\r\n\r\nA great, though perhaps academic, issue remains: Was the war justified\r\nby wisdom and by right?\r\n\r\nIf the reader will look at a map of the Nile system, he cannot fail to\r\nbe struck by its resemblance to a palm-tree. At the top the green and\r\nfertile area of the Delta spreads like the graceful leaves and foliage.\r\nThe stem is perhaps a little twisted, for the Nile makes a vast bend\r\nin flowing through the desert. South of Khartoum the likeness is again\r\nperfect, and the roots of the tree begin to stretch deeply into the\r\nSoudan. I can imagine no better illustration of the intimate and\r\nsympathetic connection between Egypt and the southern provinces. The\r\nwater--the life of the Delta--is drawn from the Soudan, and passes along\r\nthe channel of the Nile, as the sap passes up the stem of the tree, to\r\nproduce a fine crop of fruit above. The benefit to Egypt is obvious;\r\nbut Egypt does not benefit alone. The advantages of the connection\r\nare mutual; for if the Soudan is thus naturally and geographically an\r\nintegral part of Egypt, Egypt is no less essential to the development\r\nof the Soudan. Of what use would the roots and the rich soil be, if\r\nthe stem were severed, by which alone their vital essence may find\r\nexpression in the upper air?\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a plain and honest reason for the River War. To unite\r\nterritories that could not indefinitely have continued divided; to\r\ncombine peoples whose future welfare is inseparably intermingled; to\r\ncollect energies which, concentrated, may promote a common interest; to\r\njoin together what could not improve apart--these are the objects which,\r\nhistory will pronounce, have justified the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to Great Britain is no less clear to those who believe\r\nthat our connection with Egypt, as with India, is in itself a source of\r\nstrength. The grasp of England upon Egypt has been strengthened twofold\r\nby the events of the war. The joint action and ownership of the two\r\ncountries in the basin of the Upper Nile form an additional bond between\r\nthem. The command of the vital river is an irresistible weapon. The\r\ninfluence of France over the native mind in Egypt has been completely\r\ndestroyed by the result of the Fashoda negotiations; and although she\r\nstill retains the legal power to meddle in and obstruct all financial\r\narrangements, that power, unsupported by real influence, is like a\r\nbody whence the soul has fled, which may, indeed, be an offensive\r\nencumbrance, but must ultimately decompose and crumble into dust.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from any connection with Egypt, Britain has gained a vast\r\nterritory which, although it would be easy to exaggerate its value,\r\nis nevertheless coveted by every Great Power in Europe. The policy\r\nof acquiring large waterways, which has been pursued deliberately or\r\nunconsciously by British statesmen for three centuries, has been carried\r\none step further; and in the valley of the Nile England may develop\r\na trade which, passing up and down the river and its complement the\r\nrailway, shall exchange the manufactures of the Temperate Zone for the\r\nproducts of the Tropic of Cancer, and may use the north wind to drive\r\ncivilisation and prosperity to the south and the stream of the Nile to\r\nbear wealth and commerce to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXT OF THE SOUDAN AGREEMENT OF THE 19TH OF JANUARY, 1899, AND OF THE\r\nDECLARATION OF THE 21ST OF MARCH, 1899\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT AND THE\r\nGOVERNMENT OF HIS HIGHNESS THE KHEDIVE OF EGYPT, RELATIVE TO THE FUTURE\r\nADMINISTRATION OF THE SOUDAN\r\n\r\nWHEREAS certain provinces in the Soudan which were in rebellion against\r\nthe authority of His Highness the Khedive have now been reconquered\r\nby the joint military and financial efforts of Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment and the Government of His Highness the Khedive; AND whereas\r\nit has become necessary to decide upon a system for the administration\r\nof and for the making of laws for the said reconquered provinces, under\r\nwhich due allowance may be made for the backward and unsettled condition\r\nof large portions thereof, and for the varying requirements of different\r\nlocalities; AND whereas it is desired to give effect to the claims\r\nwhich have accrued to Her Britannic Majesty's Government, by right of\r\nconquest, to share in the present settlement and future working and\r\ndevelopment of the said system of administration and legislation; AND\r\nwhereas it is conceived that for many purposes Wady Halfa and Suakin\r\nmay be most effectively administered in conjunction with the reconquered\r\nprovinces to which they are respectively adjacent: NOW, it is hereby\r\nagreed and declared by and between the Undersigned, duly authorised for\r\nthat purpose, as follows:- ART. I.\r\n\r\nThe word 'Soudan' in this Agreement means all the territories South of\r\nthe 22nd parallel of latitude, which: 1. Have never been evacuated by\r\nEgyptian troops since the year 1882; or 2. Which having before the\r\nlate rebellion in the Soudan been administered by the Government of\r\nHis Highness the Khedive, were temporarily lost to Egypt, and have been\r\nreconquered by Her Majesty's Government and the Egyptian Government,\r\nacting in concert; or 3. Which may hereafter be reconquered by the two\r\nGovernments acting in concert.\r\n\r\nART. II.\r\n\r\nThe British and Egyptian flags shall be used together, both on land and\r\nwater, throughout the Soudan, except in the town of Suakin, in which\r\nlocality the Egyptian flag alone shall be used.\r\n\r\nART. III.\r\n\r\nThe supreme military and civil command in the Soudan shall be vested in\r\none officer, termed the 'Governor-General of the Soudan.' He shall be\r\nappointed by Khedivial Decree on the recommendation of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government, and shall be removed only by Khedivial Decree,\r\nwith the consent of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nART. IV.\r\n\r\nLaws, as also Orders and Regulations with the full force of law, for the\r\ngood government of the Soudan, and for regulating the holding, disposal,\r\nand devolution of property of every kind therein situate, may from\r\ntime to time be made, altered, or abrogated by Proclamation of the\r\nGovernor-General. Such Laws, Orders, and Regulations may apply to the\r\nwhole or any named part of the Soudan, and may, either explicitly or by\r\nnecessary implication, alter or abrogate any existing Law or Regulation.\r\nAll such Proclamations shall be forthwith notified to Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's Agent and Consul-General in Cairo, and to the President of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of His Highness the Khedive.\r\n\r\nART. V.\r\n\r\nNo Egyptian Law, Decree, Ministerial Arrete, or other enactment\r\nhereafter to be made or promulgated shall apply to the Soudan or\r\nany part thereof, save in so far as the same shall be applied by\r\nProclamation of the Governor-General in manner hereinbefore provided.\r\n\r\nART. VI.\r\n\r\nIn the definition by Proclamation of the conditions under which\r\nEuropeans, of whatever nationality, shall be at liberty to trade with or\r\nreside in the Soudan, or to hold property within its limits, no special\r\nprivileges shall be accorded to the subjects of any one or more Power.\r\n\r\nART. VII.\r\n\r\nImport duties on entering the Soudan shall not be payable on goods\r\ncoming from Egyptian territory. Such duties may, however, be levied on\r\ngoods coming from elsewhere than Egyptian territory; but in the case of\r\ngoods entering the Soudan at Suakin, or any other port on the Red Sea\r\nLittoral, they shall not exceed the corresponding duties for the time\r\nbeing leviable on goods entering Egypt from abroad. Duties may be levied\r\non goods leaving the Soudan, at such rates as may from time to time be\r\nprescribed by Proclamation.\r\n\r\nART. VIII.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals shall not extend, nor be\r\nrecognised for any purpose whatsoever, in any part of the Soudan, except\r\nin the town of Suakin.\r\n\r\nART.IX.\r\n\r\nUntil, and save so far as it shall be otherwise determined by\r\nProclamation, the Soudan, with the exception of the town of Suakin,\r\nshall be and remain under martial law.\r\n\r\nART. X.\r\n\r\nNo Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents shall be accredited in\r\nrespect of nor allowed to reside in the Soudan, without the previous\r\nconsent of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nART. XI.\r\n\r\nThe importation of slaves into the Soudan, as also their exportation, is\r\nabsolutely prohibited. Provision shall be made by Proclamation for the\r\nenforcement of this Regulation.\r\n\r\nART. XII.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed between the two Governments that special attention shall be\r\npaid to the enforcement of the Brussels Act of the 2nd of July, 1890,\r\nin respect to the import, sale, and manufacture of fire-arms and their\r\nmunitions, and distilled or spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Done in Cairo, the 19th of January, 1899.\r\n\r\n                             Signed: BOURTROS GHALI-CROMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION RELATIVE TO THE BRITISH AND FRENCH SPHERES OF INFLUENCE IN\r\nCENTRAL AFRICA\r\n\r\n            (Signed at London, March 21st, 1899)\r\n\r\nTHE Undersigned, duly authorised by their Governments, have signed the\r\nfollowing declaration:--The IVth Article of the Convention of the 14th\r\nof June, 1898, shall be completed by the following provisions, which\r\nshall be considered as forming an integral part of it: 1. Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government engages not to acquire either territory or\r\npolitical influence to the west of the line of frontier defined in the\r\nfollowing paragraph, and the Government of the French Republic engages\r\nnot to acquire either territory or political influence to the east of\r\nthe same line. 2. The line of frontier shall start from the point where\r\nthe boundary between the Congo Free State and French territory meets the\r\nwater-parting between the watershed of the Nile and that of the Congo\r\nand its affluents. It shall follow in principle that water-parting up\r\nto its intersection with the 11th parallel of north latitude. From this\r\npoint it shall be drawn as far as the 15th parallel in such manner as\r\nto separate, in principle, the Kingdom of Wadai from what constituted in\r\n1882 the Province of Darfur; but it shall in no case be so drawn as to\r\npass to the west beyond the 21st degree of longitude east of Greenwich\r\n(18° 40' east of Paris), or to the east beyond the 23rd degree\r\nof longitude east of Greenwich (20° 40' east of Paris). 3. It is\r\nunderstood, in principle, that to the north of the 15th parallel the\r\nFrench zone shall be limited to the north-east and east by a line which\r\nshall start from the point of intersection of the Tropic of Cancer with\r\nthe 16th degree of longitude east of Greenwich (18° 40' east of Paris),\r\nshall run thence to the south-east until it meets the 24th degree of\r\nlongitude east of Greenwich (21° 40' east of Paris), and shall then\r\nfollow the 24th degree until it meets, to the north of the 15th parallel\r\nof latitude, the frontier of Darfur as it shall eventually be fixed. 4.\r\nThe two Governments engage to appoint Commissioners who shall be\r\ncharged to delimit on the spot a frontier-line in accordance with the\r\nindications given in paragraph 2 of this Declaration. The result of\r\ntheir work shall be submitted for the approbation of their respective\r\nGovernments. It is agreed that the provisions of Article IX of the\r\nConvention of the 14th of June, 1898, shall apply equally to the\r\nterritories situated to the south of the 14° 20' parallel of north\r\nlatitude, and to the north of the 5th parallel of north latitude,\r\nbetween the 14° 20' meridian of longitude east of Greenwich (12th degree\r\neast of Paris) and the course of the Upper Nile.\r\n\r\n             Done at London, the 21st of March, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     (L.S.)
