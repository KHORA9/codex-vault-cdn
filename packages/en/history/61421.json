It is improbable that a book was\r\nprinted at Oxford so early as 1468; and the bibliographers are on various\r\ngrounds agreed that an x has been omitted. If so, Oxford must be content\r\nto date the beginning of its Press from the year 1478; while Westminster,\r\nits only English precursor, produced its first book from Caxton’s press\r\nin 1477.\r\n\r\nThe first printer was Theodoric Rood, who came to England from Cologne,\r\nand looked after the Press until about 1485; soon after which date the\r\nfirst Press came to an end. The second Press lasted from 1517 until\r\n1520, and was near Merton College. Some twenty-three books are known to\r\nhave issued from these Presses; they are for the most part classical or\r\ntheological works in Latin. There is no doubt that this early Press was\r\nreally the University Press; for many of the books have the imprint _in\r\nAlma Universitate Oxoniae_ or the like, some bear the University Arms,\r\nand some are issued with the express privilege of the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Device used on the back of the title of _Sphæra Civitatis_\r\nOxford 1588]\r\n\r\nAfter 1520 there is a gap in the history, which begins again in 1585.\r\nThe Chancellor of that time was Queen Elizabeth’s favourite, the Earl\r\nof Leicester, who in the first issue of the new Press is celebrated\r\nas its founder. Convocation in 1584 had appointed a committee _De\r\nLibris imprimendis_, and in 1586 the University lent £100 to an Oxford\r\nbookseller, Joseph Barnes, to carry on a press. In the next year an\r\nordinance of the Star Chamber allowed one press at Oxford, and one\r\napprentice in addition to the master printer. Barnes managed the Press\r\nuntil 1617, and printed many books now prized by collectors, among them\r\nthe first book printed at Oxford in Greek (the Chrysostom of 1586), the\r\nfirst book with Hebrew type (1596), Richard de Bury’s _Philobiblon_, and\r\nCaptain John Smith’s _Map of Virginia_.\r\n\r\nFOUR FOUNDERS OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archbishop Laud]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. John Fell]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF THE OLD CONGREGATION HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe first printing-house owned by the University; used for storing\r\nOriental type and printing-furniture, 1652.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Upper part of the first page of the Oxford (now London)\r\nGazette, 1665. The oldest newspaper still existing in England]\r\n\r\nThe first notable promoter of the Oxford Press was Archbishop Laud,\r\nwhose statutes contemplate the appointment of an _Architypographus_,\r\nand who secured for the University in 1632 Letters Patent authorizing\r\nthree printers (each with two presses and two apprentices), and in\r\n1636 a Royal Charter entitling the University to print ‘all manner\r\nof books’. The privilege of printing the Bible was not exercised at\r\nthis date; but in 1636 Almanacks were produced, and this seems to have\r\nalarmed the Stationers’ Company, who then enjoyed a virtual monopoly of\r\nBibles, Grammars, and Almanacks; for we find that in 1637 the University\r\nsurrendered the privilege to the Stationers for an annual payment of\r\n£200, twice the amount of Joseph Barnes’s working capital. The most\r\nfamous books belonging to what may be called the Laudian period were\r\nfive editions of Burton’s _Anatomy of Melancholy_ and one of Bacon’s\r\n_Advancement of Learning_ in English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OXFORD UNIVERSITY ARMS\r\n\r\nSome ancient examples used by the Oxford University Press]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _The History of Lapland_ by John Shefferus, 1674, the\r\nfirst anthropological book published by the Press]\r\n\r\nThe work of the Press during the Civil War is of interest to historians\r\nand bibliographers on account of the great number of Royalist Pamphlets\r\nand Proclamations issued while the Court of Charles I was at Oxford; a\r\nnumber swollen in appearance by those printed in London with counterfeit\r\nOxford imprints. But this period is not important in the history of the\r\nLearned Press; and after 1649 it suffered a partial eclipse which did\r\nnot pass until the Restoration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From W. Maundrell’s _Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem_,\r\nOxford, 1703, engraved by M. Burghers]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Press in the latter part of the seventeenth century\r\nwill always be connected with the name of the second of its great\r\npatrons, Dr. John Fell, Dean of Christ Church and Bishop of Oxford. Fell\r\nmade the great collection of type-punches and matrices from which the\r\nbeautiful types known by his name are still cast at Oxford; he promoted\r\nthe setting up of a paper mill at Wolvercote, where Oxford paper is\r\nstill made; he conducted the long, and ultimately successful, struggle\r\nwith the Stationers and the King’s Printers, from which the history of\r\nOxford Bibles and Prayer Books begins (1675). In 1671 he and three others\r\ntook over the management of the Press, paying the University £200 a\r\nyear and spending themselves a large sum upon its development. Lastly,\r\nit seems that he suggested to Archbishop Sheldon the provision, due to\r\nhis munificence, of the new and spacious printing house and _Theatre_\r\nwhich still bears his name. The Press was installed there in 1669, and\r\nbegan to issue the long series of books which bear the imprint _Oxoniae\r\ne Theatro Sheldoniano_, or in the vulgar tongue _Oxford at the Theater_.\r\nThese imprints, indeed, were still used, at times, long after the Press\r\nhad been moved from the Sheldonian to its next home in the Clarendon\r\nBuilding. Many learned folios were printed at this time, including\r\npioneer work by Oxford students of Oriental languages; the book best\r\nremembered to-day is no doubt Anthony Wood’s _Historia et Antiquitates\r\nUniversitatis Oxoniensis_ published in 1674.\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs also the first exercise of the privilege to print\r\nBibles and Prayer Books, which was recognized, as we have seen, at least\r\nas early as 1637, when the Stationers’ Company paid the University to\r\nrefrain from printing Bibles. This agreement lasted until 1642, and, by\r\nrenewal at intervals, until 1672, when it was at length denounced; and in\r\n1675 a quarto English Bible was printed _at the Theater_, and a beginning\r\nmade of what has become an extensive and highly technical process of\r\nmanufacture and distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century the Press acquired, with a new\r\nhabitation, a name still in very general use. The University was granted\r\nthe perpetual copyright of Clarendon’s _History of the Rebellion_ (a\r\npossession in which it was confirmed by the Copyright Act of 1911); and\r\nthe _Clarendon Building_ was built chiefly from the profits accruing from\r\nthe sales of that book. Many editions were printed in folio at various\r\ndates; and the Press Catalogue still offers the fine edition of 1849,\r\nwith the notes of Bishop Warburton, in seven volumes octavo, and that of\r\nthe _Life_ in two volumes, 1857; the whole comprising over 5,000 pages\r\nand sold for £4 10_s._ Still cheaper is the one-volume edition of 1843,\r\nin 1,366 pages royal octavo, the price of which is 21_s._ More recently\r\nthe demands of piety have been still further satisfied by the issue of\r\na new edition based on fresh collations made from the manuscript by the\r\nlate Dr. Macray. Though the Clarendon Building long since ceased to be\r\na printing house, one of its rooms is still _The Delegates’ Room_; and\r\nthere the Delegates of the Press hold their stated meetings.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the Bible Press grew in strength with the\r\nco-operation of London booksellers and finally with the establishment\r\n(in 1770, if not earlier) of its own Bible Warehouse in Paternoster\r\nRow. The Learned Press, on the other hand, though some important books\r\nwere produced, suffered from the general apathy which then pervaded the\r\nUniversity. Sir William Blackstone, having been appointed a Delegate,\r\nfound that his colleagues did not meet, or met only to do nothing;\r\nand addressed to the Vice-Chancellor a vigorous pamphlet, in which he\r\ndescribed the Press as ‘languishing in a lazy obscurity, and barely\r\nreminding us of its existence, by now and then slowly bringing forth a\r\nProgram, a Sermon printed by request, or at best a Bodleian Catalogue’.\r\nThe great lawyer’s polemic gradually battered down the ramparts of\r\nignorant negligence, and the Press began to revive under the new statute\r\nwhich he promoted. Dr. Johnson in 1767 was able to assure his sovereign\r\nthat the authorities at Oxford ‘had put their press under better\r\nregulation, and were at that time printing _Polybius_’.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Three University Presses]\r\n\r\nThe Clarendon Building is not large, and the Press very soon outgrowing\r\nit was partly housed in various adjacent buildings, until in 1826-30\r\nthe present Press in Walton Street was erected. It is remarkable that\r\nthough the building is more like a college than a factory—it is of the\r\nquadrangular plan regular in Oxford—and was built when printing was\r\nstill mainly a handicraft, it has been found possible to adapt its solid\r\nfabric and spacious rooms to modern processes with very little structural\r\nalteration. Extensive additions, however, have been and are even now\r\nbeing made.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the nineteenth century are too various to detail; but\r\na few outstanding facts claim mention. The Bible business continued to\r\nprosper, and gained immensely in variety by the introduction of Oxford\r\nIndia paper and by the publication, in conjunction with Cambridge, of the\r\nRevised Version of the Old and New Testaments. Earlier in the century\r\nthere was a period of great activity in the production of editions of the\r\nClassics, in which Gaisford played a great part and to which many foreign\r\nscholars like Wyttenbach and Dindorf gave their support. Later, in the\r\nSecretaryships of Kitchin (for many years afterwards Dean of Durham) and\r\nof Bartholomew Price, new ground was broken with the famous _Clarendon\r\nPress Series_ of school books by such scholars as Aldis Wright, whose\r\neditions of Shakespeare have long served as a quarry for successive\r\neditors. The _New English Dictionary_ began to be published in 1884.\r\nMeanwhile the manufacturing powers of the Press at Oxford and the selling\r\npowers of the publishing house in London were very widely extended by the\r\nenergies of Mr. Horace Hart and Mr. Henry Frowde, and the foundations\r\nwere laid of the great and multifarious enterprises which belong to the\r\nhistory of the last twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUADRANGLE OF THE UNIVERSITY PRESS AT OXFORD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fire-place in the Delegates’ Room Clarendon Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grinling Gibbons Fire-place in one of the London Offices]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Press in the first two decades of the present century\r\nis due to the co-operation of a large number of individuals: of the\r\nmembers of the University who have acted as Delegates; of their officers,\r\nmanagers, and employees; and of the authors of Oxford books. In so far,\r\nhowever, as this period of its history can be identified with the name of\r\none man, it will be remembered as that in which the late CHARLES CANNAN\r\nserved the Delegates as Secretary. The Delegates at his death placed\r\non record their judgement that he had made an inestimable contribution\r\nto the prosperity and usefulness of the Press. The _Times Literary\r\nSupplement_, in reviewing the last edition of the _Oxford University\r\nRoll of Service_, gave some account of the services performed by the\r\nUniversity in the war. One paragraph dealt with the work of the Press:—\r\n\r\n‘Probably no European Press did more to propagate historical and ethical\r\ntruth about the war. The death of its Secretary, Charles Cannan, a year\r\nago, has left an inconsolable regret among all those more fortunate\r\nOxford men, old and young, who had the honour to be acquainted with\r\none of the finest characters and most piercing intelligences of our\r\ntime. He was a very great man, and is alive to-day in the spirit of the\r\ninstitution which he enriched with his personality and his life.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _The Press at Oxford_\r\n\r\nThe main building of the Oxford Press, erected 1826-30, consists of\r\nthree sides of a quadrangle. The two main wings, each of three floors,\r\nare still known as the _Learned Side_ and the _Bible Side_, though their\r\nappropriation to Bibles and secular books has long since ceased in\r\nfact. On the Learned Side are the hand composing rooms, both the book\r\ndepartment and the jobbing department, where some readers and compositors\r\nare employed in setting up the official papers of the University,\r\nexamination papers, and other miscellaneous work, and the more difficult\r\nand complicated books produced for the Delegates or other publishers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of type in the Press is estimated at over one million\r\npounds of metal, and includes some 550 different founts of type in\r\nsome 150 different characters, ranging from the hieroglyphic and the\r\nprehistoric ‘Minoan’ (cast to record Sir Arthur Evans’s discoveries), to\r\nthe phonetic scripts of Sweet and Passy; and including Sanskrit, Greek,\r\nRoman, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Amharic, Coptic, Armenian,\r\nChinese, Tibetan, Burmese, Sinhalese, Tamil, Gothic, Cyrillic. Here,\r\ntoo, are the famous Fell types acquired by the University about 1667.\r\nThese are virtually the same as the founts from which were printed the\r\nfirst edition of _The Faerie Queene_ and the First Folio Shakespeare;\r\nand their beauty makes them still the envy of printers all the world\r\nover. Here compositors are still daily engaged in setting the Oxford\r\nDictionary (with its twenty-one different sizes or characters of type),\r\nwhich has been slowly growing since 1882. One compositor has a record of\r\nthirty-eight years’ continuous work on the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn part of the same wing is the _Delegates’ Warehouse_. Here, and in a\r\nnumber of annexes, including the old _Delegates’ School_ built about\r\n1840, repose the oldest and most durable of the Delegates’ publications.\r\nThey are stored for the most part in lofty stacks of unfolded sheets,\r\nlike the piers of a Norman crypt. From these vaults was drawn into the\r\nupper air, in 1907, the last copy of Wilkins’s _Coptic New Testament_,\r\npublished in 1716, the paper hardly discoloured and the impression still\r\nblack and brilliant. It is estimated that these warehouses contain some\r\nthree and a half million copies of about four thousand five hundred\r\ndistinct books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Oak Frames in one of the Composing Rooms]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Upper Composing Room]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monotype Casters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ink-making]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Machine Room]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Perfecting Machine with Self-feeder]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Bindery (now a Warehouse)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Warehouses]\r\n\r\nOf the _Bible Side_ the ground floor is now the press room or _Machine\r\nRoom_, which, with its more recent extensions, holds about fifty\r\nmachines, from the last survivor of the old flat-impression double\r\nPlatens to the most modern American double-cylinder ‘perfecting’ presses\r\nwith their automatic ‘feeders’. All kinds of printing are done here,\r\nfrom the small numbers of an oriental book or a Prayer Book in black and\r\nred to the largest impression of a Bible printed in sheets containing\r\n320 pages each. The long experience of printing Bibles on thin paper and\r\nespecially on Oxford India paper has given the Oxford machine-minder an\r\nunrivalled dexterity in the nice adjustment required to produce a fine\r\nclean effect on paper which will not stand a heavy impression.\r\n\r\nAs the sheets come from machine they are sent to the _Bindery_. This\r\nwas until recently on the floor above the machine room, but has lately\r\nbeen transferred to a larger and more convenient building erected in the\r\nold garden behind the Press. The Oxford Bindery deals with most of the\r\nClarendon Press books in cloth bindings, and prides itself upon the fine\r\nfinish of the cases and gilding of such beautiful books as the _Oxford\r\nBook of English Verse_, as well as on being able to turn out artistic and\r\nattractive cloth and paper bindings for books sold at the lowest prices.\r\nIt still deals with a part only of the books printed under the same roof;\r\nbut a large expansion is looked for in the near future.\r\n\r\nBetween the two wings, and across the quadrangle, are two houses once\r\noccupied by the late Horace Hart and by Dr. Henry Bradley, now the senior\r\nof the three editors of the Oxford Dictionary. The houses became some\r\nyears ago unfit for habitation from the encroachment of machinery; but\r\none of them was a welcome refuge during the years of war to the staff of\r\nthe Oxford Local Examinations, who on the 5th of August 1914 were turned\r\nout of their office at an hour’s notice to make room for a Base Hospital.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the houses are the fire-proof _Plate Room_, where some 750\r\ntons of metal are stored, the _Stereotype and Electrotype Foundry_,\r\nand the _Monotype Rooms_, a department which has lately added to its\r\nequipment and bids fair to pass the ancient composing rooms in output.\r\nOther departments in and about the old building are the _Photographic\r\nRoom_, famous for its collotype printing, the _Type Foundry_, where Fell\r\ntype is still cast from the old matrices, and the _Ink Factory_.\r\n\r\nThe front of the building on Walton Street consists chiefly of packing\r\nrooms, where books are dispatched by rail or road to the City of London\r\nand elsewhere, and of offices—those of the Printer to the University on\r\nthe ground floor and those of the Secretary to the Delegates above. Here\r\nare reference libraries of books printed or published by the Press, and\r\nrecords ranging from the oldest Delegates’ minute-book of the seventeenth\r\ncentury to modern type-written correspondence arranged on the ‘vertical’\r\nsystem of filing.\r\n\r\nAs the visitor enters the main gate the first object which catches his\r\neye is a plain stone monument on the lawn. There are inscribed the names\r\nof the forty-four men of the Oxford Press who gave their lives in the\r\nWar. Beyond the memorial is the quadrangle, made beautiful by grass and\r\nold trees; and from upper windows it is still possible to look over the\r\nflats of the Thames Valley and see the sun set behind Wytham Woods.\r\n\r\nCorporate feeling has always been strong among the workers at the\r\nPress, and though the Delegates and their officers have done what they\r\ncould to promote it, it is essentially a natural growth. Many of the\r\nwork-people come of families which have been connected with the Press for\r\ngenerations; and they are proud not only of the old traditions of fine\r\nand honest work, but also of the usefulness and scholarly excellence of\r\nthe books on which their labour is spent. The Press is, in all its parts,\r\nconscious at once of its unity and of its relation to the University of\r\nwhich it is an integral part.\r\n\r\nTHE NAGEL BUILDING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Bindery]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Crypt]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WAR MEMORIAL]\r\n\r\nThis spirit is well shown by the history of the Press Volunteer Fire\r\nBrigade, constituted in 1885. The Brigade now numbers thirty-two officers\r\nand men, who by regular drills and competitions have made themselves\r\nefficient firemen, and able to assist the Oxford City Brigade in case\r\nof need. The Press possesses also a branch of the St. John Ambulance\r\nBrigade, and first aid can be given at once if any accident happens.\r\n\r\nVarious Provident and Benevolent Societies exist at the Press, and the\r\nprinciple of co-operation by the employer was recognized for many years\r\nbefore the passing of the National Health Insurance Act. The Hospitals\r\nFund makes substantial yearly contributions to the Radcliffe Infirmary\r\nand the Oxford Eye Hospital, and in view of the pressing needs of these\r\ninstitutions the subscription to the Fund has recently been doubled.\r\n\r\nThe common life naturally finds expression in the organization of\r\nrecreation of all kinds. There is a Dramatic Society, the records of\r\nwhich go back to 1860; an Instrumental Society, dating from 1852; a Vocal\r\nSociety, a Minstrel Society, a Piscatorial Society; Athletic, Cricket,\r\nFootball, and Bowls Clubs, now amalgamated; and, not the least useful nor\r\nthe least entertaining, the Gardening Association, formed during the war\r\nto meet the demand for more potatoes. Such of the men of the Press as\r\nwere obliged to content themselves with the defence of the home front,\r\nresponded with enthusiasm in their own gardens and allotments; and the\r\nFood Production Exhibition which crowned their efforts in the summer of\r\n1918 became an annual event. In peace, as in war, there is need for all\r\nthe food we can produce; and the Gardening Association has very wisely\r\nnot relaxed its efforts.\r\n\r\nThe Clarendon Press Institute in Walton Street, close to the Press\r\nitself, provides accommodation for lectures, debates, and dramatic and\r\nother entertainments, as well as a library, a reading room, and rooms for\r\nindoor games. The building was given by the Delegates, who contribute to\r\nits maintenance, but its management is completely democratic. The members\r\nappoint their own executive and are responsible for their own finances.\r\n\r\nThe Council have since 1919 issued a quarterly illustrated Magazine,\r\nprinted ‘in the house’. The _Clarendonian_ publishes valuable and\r\nentertaining records of the professional interests and social activities\r\nof the employees of the Press, as well as affording some outlet for\r\nliterary aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Press in the War_\r\n\r\nThe Press made to the prosecution of the War both a direct and an\r\nindirect contribution. In August 1914 about 575 adult males were employed\r\nat Oxford; of these sixty-three, being members of the Territorial Force,\r\nwere mobilized at the outbreak of war; and of the remainder some 293\r\nenlisted in 1914 or later. Considering the number of those who from age\r\nor other causes were unfit for service, the proportion of voluntary\r\nenlistment was high. The London Office and Wolvercote Mill also gave\r\ntheir quota to the service of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThose who were obliged to remain behind were not idle. The Oxford\r\nhistorians at once engaged in the controversy upon the responsibility for\r\nthe War; and in September 1914 the Press published _Why We are at War:\r\nGreat Britain’s Case_, a series of essays closely and dispassionately\r\nreasoned, and illustrated by official documents including the German\r\nWhite Book, reproduced exactly from the English translation published in\r\nBerlin for neutral consumption and vitiated by clumsy variations from\r\nthe German original. _Why We are at War_ rapidly went through twelve\r\nimpressions, and at the instance of Government was translated into six\r\nlanguages. The profits were handed over to the Belgian Relief Fund. At\r\nthe same time was initiated, under the editorship of Mr. H. W. C. Davis,\r\nthe series of Oxford Pamphlets on war topics, of which in a short time\r\nmore than half a million copies were sold all over the world. Later, when\r\nthe public appetite for pamphlets slackened, and the world had leisure\r\nfor closer study, the series of _Histories of the Belligerents_ was\r\nfounded, which is noticed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n‘The Clarendon Press,’ writes Sir Walter Raleigh in his Introduction to\r\nthe _Oxford University Roll of Service_, ‘though deprived of the services\r\nof virtually all its men of military age, was active in the production of\r\nbooks and pamphlets, most of them written by Oxford men, setting forth\r\nthe causes and issues of the War—a mine of information, and an armoury of\r\napologetics.’\r\n\r\nNot the least of the services rendered by the Press was the printing\r\ndone for the Naval Intelligence Department of the Admiralty directed by\r\nAdmiral Sir Reginald Hall. Both secrecy and speed were essential to the\r\nusefulness of this work, and to secure them the Printer to the University\r\nmade special arrangements involving a severe strain upon himself and\r\nthose to whom the work was entrusted. Admiral Hall, when unveiling the\r\nPress War Memorial in October 1920, declared that the work done was\r\nunique in kind, and that without the help of the Press the operations of\r\nhis Department could not have been carried out with success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOLVERCOTE PAPER MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rag Sorting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rag Cutting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rag Boiling]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rag Breaking]\r\n\r\nAs the War dragged on, the numbers employed at the Press steadily\r\ndeclined; the demands of Government as steadily increased; the shortage\r\nof materials of all kinds became more and more acute. None the less\r\nthe Bible Press met an unprecedented demand for the New Testament by\r\nsupplying within three years four and a half million of copies for use\r\nin the field. The Learned Press, too, continued to produce, though\r\nthe volume of production became less and less. The machinery of the\r\nDictionary, though its movement was retarded, never came to a standstill.\r\nThe scientific journals continued to appear, and not a few learned books\r\nwere published. A greater number, however, were placed in the Delegates’\r\nsafes, in expectation of the increased facilities which the end of the\r\nWar has hardly brought. The manufacturing powers of the Press, indeed,\r\nhave virtually reached their pre-war level; but the ever-rising cost of\r\nlabour and materials has made it as yet impossible to restore to its old\r\nvolume the output of books which could at no time have been remunerative.\r\nIt may be added that the Delegates, like other publishers, have had to\r\nconsider that the purchasing power of the public on which they rely has\r\nnot kept pace with the rise in costs. The price of books has of course\r\nrisen very greatly; but the ratio of increase has been substantially\r\nlower than that of commodities in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Wolvercote Paper Mill_\r\n\r\nThe first mention of paper-making in or near Oxford is a story of one\r\nEdwards, who about 1670 planned to erect a mill at Wolvercote and was\r\nencouraged by Fell. In 1718 Hearne the antiquary wrote that ‘some of the\r\nbest paper in England is made at Wolvercote Mill’. It was bought by the\r\nPress in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe Mill stands on a branch of the Thames, on the edge of the quiet\r\nvillage of Wolvercote, and near the ruins of Godstow Nunnery. The\r\nwater-wheel has long ceased to play more than a very minor part in the\r\ndriving of the mill, which now has two modern paper-making machines, 72\r\nand 80 inches wide respectively. The power used is partly steam, but a\r\nlarge part of the plant has quite recently been electrified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beater Room]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Machine Room]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paper Sorting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paper Stock Warehouse]\r\n\r\nMost varieties of high-class printing paper are made at Wolvercote,\r\nwhich besides feeding the Press does a considerable trade with other\r\nprinters. The paper made for the Oxford Dictionary and some other books\r\nis of the finest rag and is probably as durable as the best hand-made\r\npaper of former times. But the Mill is best known for its ‘Bible’ papers,\r\nexceptionally thin, tough, and opaque, with a fine printing surface.\r\nPaper of this kind reaches its acme in the famous Oxford India Paper, the\r\ninvention of which made revolutionary changes in the printing of Bibles.\r\nA great many Oxford books are now printed in two editions, an ordinary\r\nand an India paper. If the saving of space is an important consideration,\r\nthe convenience of the thinner editions of such books as the _Concise\r\nOxford Dictionary_, the _Concise Dictionary of National Biography_, or\r\nthe _Oxford Survey of the British Empire_ is obvious; and many people\r\nlike to read the Poets and the Classics in thin and light volumes. The\r\n_Oxford Homer_ will go into a pocket, though it has 1,374 pages; and\r\nthe India paper _Shakespeare_ and _Oxford Book of English Verse_ are\r\ndelightfully easy to carry and handle.\r\n\r\nThe Controller of the Mill is Mr. Douglas Clapperton (a name well known\r\nin the paper trade), who succeeded Mr. Joseph Castle in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The Press in London_\r\n\r\nThe association of the Oxford Press with London booksellers—the\r\npublishers of former days—goes back to early times. Apart from the\r\nnegative agreement with the Stationers’ Company, _not_ to print Bibles\r\nand Almanacks, we find, at the end of the seventeenth century, Oxford\r\nBibles bearing the imprint of various London booksellers. In 1776 Dr.\r\nJohnson wrote to the Master of University College a letter, printed\r\nby Boswell, in which he sets forth with knowledge and perspicacity\r\nthe philosophy of bookselling; the moral of the discourse is that the\r\nUniversity must offer more attractive discounts to the book trade—a\r\ndoctrine which has been adopted in modern times, though in 1776 it\r\nperhaps fell upon deaf ears.\r\n\r\nNot later than 1770 a Bible Warehouse was established in Paternoster\r\nRow. But it was not until a century later that the Press undertook\r\nthe distribution in London of its secular books. In 1884 these books,\r\nformerly sold by Messrs. Macmillan, were taken over by the Manager of\r\nthe Bible Warehouse, Mr. Henry Frowde, who thus became sole publisher to\r\nthe University; an office which he continued to hold with great skill,\r\ndevotion, and success until on his retirement in 1913 he was succeeded by\r\nMr. Humphrey Milford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMEN CORNER LONDON]\r\n\r\nTo-day the activities of the Press in or near Amen Corner, London, E.C.\r\n4, are multifarious. From his bound stocks Mr. Milford is ready at short\r\nnotice to supply to the booksellers or booksellers’ agents any Clarendon\r\nPress book, any Bible or Prayer Book, any of the books published by\r\nhimself as publisher to the University, such as Oxford Poets, World’s\r\nClassics, Oxford Elementary Books, or by himself and Messrs. Hodder and\r\nStoughton—the Oxford Medical Publications—or for the numerous learned\r\nbodies and American Universities for whom he is agent whether in the\r\nUnited Kingdom or universally.\r\n\r\nIn the premises at Amen Corner alone it is estimated that upwards of\r\nthree quarters of a million books are at any one time in stock. Packing\r\nand distribution is carried on in the basement and also at Falcon Square,\r\nwhere the large export department operates. Mr. Milford also maintains at\r\nOld Street a ‘quire’ department from which books in sheets are given out\r\nto his own or other binderies, and in Aldersgate Street a bindery from\r\nwhich many of the finest Bibles and other leather books are turned out.\r\n\r\nThe offices at Amen Corner are the centre of the selling activities\r\nof the Press; from them is directed the policy of the branches of the\r\nbusiness at home and abroad. An institution so far-flung naturally causes\r\nsome confusion in the public mind. Inquiries from India have sometimes\r\nbeen addressed to New York, and Mr. Horace Hart treasured an envelope\r\naddressed to _The Controller of the Universe_. In general, however, it\r\nis now widely understood that inquiries for books should be addressed\r\n(by booksellers, or by the public, if the usual trade channels fail)\r\nto _Oxford University Press_ in London or at the nearest Branch (New\r\nYork, Toronto, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Shanghai,\r\nCopenhagen); questions about printing to _Controller, Clarendon Press,\r\nOxford_, and proposals for publication either to the nearest Branch or\r\ndirect to the _Secretary, Clarendon Press, Oxford_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _The Administration of the Press_\r\n\r\nAll the activities of the Press may be described as a function of the\r\ncorporation known as the _Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars_ of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, acting through the Delegates of the Press. The\r\nconstitution of this Delegacy is in some respects peculiar. So long ago\r\nas 1757 the statute promoted by Sir William Blackstone for the better\r\nmanagement of the Press established the principles of continuity and of\r\nexpert knowledge by the constitution of _Perpetual Delegates_; and these\r\nprinciples have been maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Delegacy is now composed of the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors for\r\nthe time being _ex officio_, and (normally) of ten others, of whom\r\nfive are Perpetual. Delegates are appointed for a term of years by the\r\nVice-Chancellor and Proctors, by whom they may be re-elected; but when a\r\nvacancy occurs among the perpetual Delegates, the Delegates as a whole\r\nare enjoined by statute to ‘subrogate’ one of the junior Delegates\r\nto be perpetual, _ad supplendum perpetuo numerum quinque Perpetuorum\r\nDelegatorum_.\r\n\r\nThe roll of the Delegates contains the names of many famous scholars.\r\nAmong those of recent times may be mentioned William Stubbs, Ingram\r\nBywater, Frederick York Powell. Within the last few years the Press has\r\nsustained very heavy losses in the death of some of the most experienced\r\nof its Delegates. William Sanday, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity,\r\ntook an active part in the many works of profound learning upon New\r\nTestament criticism, by which Oxford has maintained its fame for the\r\nprosecution of Biblical learning. Henry Tresawna Gerrans, Fellow of\r\nWorcester College, was active in financial administration and in the\r\norganization of educational publications. David Henry Nagel, Fellow\r\nof Trinity College, gave invaluable advice on scientific books and on\r\ntechnical processes of manufacture. He was chiefly responsible for the\r\nplan of the new Bindery, recently completed, which bears his name. The\r\nservices of Sir William Osler, Regius Professor of Medicine, and of\r\nCharles Cannan, of Trinity College, for over twenty years Secretary to\r\nthe Delegates, are noticed elsewhere in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the board on 1 December 1921 was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Chancellor (Dr. L. R. Farnell, Rector of Exeter College) and\r\nthe Proctors; T. B. Strong, Bishop of Ripon and formerly Dean of Christ\r\nChurch (_extra numerum_, by Decree of Convocation); C. R. L. Fletcher,\r\nMagdalen College; P. E. Matheson, Fellow of New College; D. G. Hogarth,\r\nFellow of Magdalen College and Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum; N.\r\nWhatley, Fellow of Hertford College; Sir Walter Raleigh, Fellow of Merton\r\nCollege and Professor of English Literature—all perpetual Delegates: H.\r\nJ. White, Dean of Christ Church; Sir Archibald Garrod, Student of Christ\r\nChurch and Regius Professor of Medicine; Cyril Bailey, Fellow of Balliol\r\nCollege; H. E. D. Blakiston, President of Trinity; and N. V. Sidgwick,\r\nFellow of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe principal officers are: _in Oxford_, R. W. Chapman, Oriel College,\r\n_Secretary_; J. de M. Johnson, Exeter College, _Assistant Secretary_; F.\r\nJ. Hall, _Printer to the University_; _in London_, Humphrey Milford, New\r\nCollege, _Publisher to the University_; _in New York_, W. W. McIntosh,\r\nVice-President of the American Branch; _in Toronto_, S. B. Gundy, Manager\r\nof the Canadian Branch; _in Bombay_, G. F. J. Cumberlege, Worcester\r\nCollege, Manager of the Indian Branch; _in Melbourne_, E. R. Bartholomew,\r\nManager of the Australian Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Finances of the Press_\r\n\r\nFor some two centuries from the time of Fell the Press was partly\r\ncontrolled by private partners; since the last of these was bought out\r\nby the efforts of Bartholomew Price, the University has been completely\r\nmaster of all its printing and publishing business. The Press to-day has\r\nno shareholders or debenture-holders, and subserves no private interest.\r\nOn the other hand it possesses virtually no endowment. The whole of its\r\ngreat business has been gradually built up by the thrifty utilization\r\nof profits made by the sale of its books or in a minor degree from work\r\ndone for outside customers. The maintenance of the Learned Press, with\r\nits output of scholarly and educational books, many of which are in\r\ntheir nature unremunerative, depends and has always depended upon the\r\nprofitable management of the publications of the Press as a whole. In the\r\nlast century the revenue devoted to learning was supplied mainly from the\r\nsale of Bibles and Prayer Books; but changing conditions led the managers\r\nof the Press to the conclusion that if the promotion of education and\r\nresearch were to keep pace with the growing volume and range of the\r\ndemand, it would be necessary to expand the general activities of the\r\nbusiness in many directions.\r\n\r\nIn prudent pursuance of a far-sighted policy, the overseas Branches\r\nof the Press were established to increase the sale of Oxford books;\r\nnew departments of the publishing business were created, such as the\r\nvery extensive series of cheap editions of the English Classics, and,\r\nmore recently, the Oxford Elementary Books and the Oxford Medical\r\nPublications; and in the course of years the publications of the Learned\r\nPress itself have gradually become more popular in character and\r\naddressed to a wider audience. In the event, the Press to-day possesses a\r\nbusiness of such magnitude and variety as will, it may be hoped, enable\r\nit to surmount the formidable obstacles which the increased cost of\r\nmanufacture opposes to the production of all works of learning.\r\n\r\nThe demands made upon the Press for the organization and publication\r\nof research are now at least as great as ever. It has again and again\r\nbeen pointed out by the friends of research, that organization and\r\nencouragement are idle unless the publication of valuable results is\r\nguaranteed; and in the past scholars in this country, and not in this\r\ncountry only, have looked to the Presses of Oxford and Cambridge to do\r\nthe work which in Germany was carried out by Academies subsidized by\r\nGovernment for this purpose. But the fulfilment of such expectations is\r\nfar more onerous than formerly. The tenth and last volume of the great\r\nEnglish Dictionary, now more than half printed, will when it is complete\r\nhave cost at least £50,000. The revised edition of Liddell and Scott’s\r\nGreek Lexicon, upon which the Delegates embarked some years before the\r\nwar, is now estimated to cost £20,000. These are enterprises in the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of which the honour of the University is concerned;\r\nand they will be concluded; but the date of completion, and therefore the\r\ninitiation of other projects of learning, have inevitably been retarded\r\nby the events of the last seven years.\r\n\r\nThe endowment of research is a difficult subject, and nobody is more\r\nconscious than are the Delegates of the Press, that results of lasting\r\nvalue are not achieved by the mere expenditure of money. Yet they cannot\r\nbut be aware that by the possession of the machinery and traditions of\r\nsuch works as the English Dictionary, and by their intimate association\r\nwith experts in many fields, they are in a position to promote research\r\nand co-operative enterprise in the most effective and economical way.\r\nThe support given to the Press in the past, whether by individuals\r\nor by other institutions devoted to learning, has been trifling in\r\nconsideration of the work which it has produced. The need of such support\r\nis now far more urgent; and the record of the Press is proof that\r\nfinancial support would be turned to good account.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Oxford Imprints_\r\n\r\nThe imprints used by the Press as printers and as publishers are\r\nvarious, and their import is not always understood. _Oxford at the\r\nClarendon Press_ is historically and strictly a printer’s imprint, and\r\nit is confined to books printed at Oxford; but it has come to mean\r\nmore than this, and to be appropriated to such books as are not only\r\nprinted at Oxford, but are also published _auctoritate Universitatis_,\r\ntheir contents as well as their form being certified by the University,\r\nacting through the Delegates of the Press. A book with this imprint may\r\nin general be assumed to be published at the expense of the Delegates;\r\nbut the ‘Clarendon Press imprint’ has come to be so prized as carrying\r\nthe Oxford ‘hall-mark’ that its use has occasionally been solicited and\r\naccorded for works of learning produced under the patronage of government\r\nor of learned societies within the Empire and the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Press publishes also, in the ordinary course of business, large\r\nnumbers of books for which the Delegates assume a less particular\r\nresponsibility; these are issued with the London imprint of the Publisher\r\nto the University (_Oxford University Press: London, Humphrey Milford_)\r\nor those of its branches abroad (_Oxford University Press American\r\nBranch_, _Oxford University Press Indian Branch_ and so on), or on behalf\r\nof the numerous universities, learned societies, or private publishers\r\nfor whom the University Press publishes either universally or in certain\r\nparts of the world. Among the bodies for whom the Press acts as publisher\r\nare the British Museum, the British Academy, the Early English Text\r\nSociety, the Chaucer Society, and the Philological Society; the Egypt\r\nExploration Society, Society of Antiquaries, the Pali Text Society,\r\nthe Church Music Society, and the Royal Society of Literature; the\r\nUniversities of St. Andrews, Bombay, and Madras; the University Presses\r\nof Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton; the Carnegie Endowment for\r\nInternational Peace, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the American\r\nHistorical Association, and the American Scandinavian Foundation. _The\r\nOxford Medical Publications_ and some other books are issued with the\r\njoint imprint of Henry Frowde (Mr. Humphrey Milford’s predecessor as\r\nPublisher to the University) and Hodder and Stoughton. The Press is\r\npublisher in Australia to many English houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _Catalogues and Advertisement_\r\n\r\nUntil recent years the Press has relied on its trade catalogues and\r\nspecial lists, and on the skilled assistance of the bookseller, to\r\nmake known to the public the great number and variety of its issues of\r\nthe Bible, the New Testament, Prayer Books, Hymn Books, and kindred\r\nworks, as well as of its general publications—reprints, medical books,\r\nelementary books and so on; while the Clarendon Press Catalogue of\r\nlearned and educational books was a relatively modest affair of under\r\n200 pages. The need of a single general catalogue for the information of\r\nlibrarians and book-lovers had long been felt, but pressure of business\r\ndelayed its preparation until the late Mr. Charles Cannan addressed\r\nhimself to the task, and with the devoted co-operation of his daughters\r\n(who had replaced the members of the office staff gone forth to war)\r\nand the advice of many scholars, produced in 1916 the first edition of\r\nthe _General Catalogue_, comprising over 500 pages of close print and\r\nincluding under one comprehensive classification all the secular books\r\nsold by the Press, wheresoever printed, and whether published by the\r\nUniversity on its own account or on behalf of other University Presses\r\nor learned bodies; together with a representative list of Bibles, &c.\r\n(useful to the inquirer though not intended as any substitute for the\r\nelaborate trade catalogues or for the indispensable guidance of the\r\nexpert bookseller), and a very full alphabetical index.\r\n\r\nThe General Catalogue has in the second edition been brought up to\r\nJanuary 1920, and a third edition is in preparation. Supplements are also\r\nfrom time to time issued comprehending the books published since the\r\ncurrent edition of the Catalogue. The Supplement now current comprises\r\nall books published in 1920.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of specialists the Catalogue is also issued in\r\nsections—History, Literature, the Classics, Natural Science, Cheap\r\nReprints—and special lists have recently been made of books on such\r\nsubjects as the British Empire, International Law and Politics, India,\r\nModern Philosophy. Schoolmasters and University teachers are asked\r\nto apply for the _Select Educational Catalogue_ issued at frequent\r\nintervals, which by omission of the larger and more elaborate books\r\nallows of illustrative information for which there is no room in the\r\ngeneral catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe General Catalogue has been computed to contain over 8,000 distinct\r\nbooks or editions of books. These vary from such works as the _New\r\nEnglish Dictionary_ and the _Dictionary of National Biography_, with\r\ntheir 15,000 and 30,000 pages, to the smallest and cheapest pamphlets and\r\nschool-books. The total may be guessed to comprise something like two and\r\na half millions of printed pages of which no two are identical.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the Catalogue has secured a wide and increasing recognition\r\nof the comprehensive character of Oxford publications. ‘There are\r\npublishers and publishers, but there is only one Oxford University\r\nPress’, exclaims a writer in the _Athenaeum_; and many reviewers have\r\nnoted with sympathetic admiration the value of the Catalogue, not as a\r\nmere price list but as a work of reference and as a book to read. Though\r\nit necessarily requires revision as new publications accrue, it is hoped\r\nthat the Catalogue will not be treated as ‘throw-away literature’. It is\r\na well-printed and solidly bound book, and the cost of supplying free\r\ncopies to book-buyers all over the world is not inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe Press produces two periodicals descriptive of its publications:\r\nthe official _Bulletin_ distributed to booksellers, librarians, and\r\nother professional buyers, and the unofficial _Periodical_ addressed\r\nto amateurs. Number 1 of the _Bulletin_ (4 April 1912) consisted of a\r\nsingle page; but the desire for more information was widely expressed,\r\nand a recent number contains in eight pages a classified list of books\r\npublished during four weeks, with bibliographical and other particulars,\r\na statement of the various catalogues obtainable on application, extracts\r\nfrom reviews, and a list of books which have gone out of print since\r\nthe current issue of the catalogue. This list is designed to protect\r\nbooksellers and the public against the assumption, too frequently made,\r\nthat any and every book is ‘out of print’ which cannot be produced at\r\na moment’s notice. The public are asked not to believe too easily that\r\nbooks are unobtainable. A provincial bookseller (in a University town)\r\nrecently declared himself ‘unable to trace’ an Oxford book, published in\r\n1920, reviewed at length by the leading literary papers, and advertised\r\nnearly every other week in the _Times Literary Supplement_. Many books\r\nno doubt (though not many Oxford books) have been and still are out\r\nof print; and in the absence of an up-to-date index of current books,\r\nthe difficulties of the bookseller have been great. Now, however, when\r\nthe 1920 edition of the trade _Reference Catalogue_ is available, with\r\nits single alphabetical index (of 1,075 pages in double column), the\r\nascertainment of the facts is not difficult except in so far as the\r\ncatalogues indexed have themselves become obsolete. All information about\r\nOxford books that is _not_ in the 1920 _Reference Catalogue_ may be found\r\nin the _Supplement_ of Books published in 1920, or in the cumulative list\r\nof _Price Changes_, or in the _Bulletin_; all of which every bookseller\r\nhas, or may have for the asking.\r\n\r\nWith the _Bulletin_ is issued from time to time a supplement calling the\r\nattention of librarians and others to Oxford books in some special field.\r\nThe circulation of the _Bulletin_ is about 2,000.\r\n\r\nThe _Periodical_ is a ‘house magazine’, perhaps the first of its kind. It\r\nwas first published in December 1896, and now appears five times a year.\r\nIts contents include extracts, of sufficient length to be readable, from\r\nnew Oxford books, specimen illustrations, quotations from reviews and\r\nother newspaper comment on the productions of the Press, obituaries and\r\nother honorific notices of authors (on appointment, decoration, or the\r\nlike), and a certain amount of quasi-literary gossip; for even authors\r\nhave their foibles. The original editor, who has compiled every number\r\nfor a quarter of a century, is still at his post, and the popularity of\r\nthe little paper increases. The demand comes from all over the world—the\r\nUnited States takes nearly half the total and the number of copies\r\ndistributed gratis of each issue now exceeds ten thousand.\r\n\r\nOxford Bibles and Prayer Books can be inspected in mass at many\r\nbooksellers’, as well as in the Depository at 116 High Street, Oxford,\r\nand in the showrooms at Amen Corner, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and in\r\nthe Branches overseas. Lack of space has everywhere made it impossible\r\nto exhibit the far greater number of Clarendon Press and other secular\r\nbooks on the same scale, but the books may be seen on application at any\r\nof the Press offices, and the popular series, gift books, &c., are always\r\ndisplayed. It is hoped before long to increase the space available for\r\nthis purpose in the Oxford Depository, and to exhibit there all Clarendon\r\nPress books, arranged by subjects as in the Catalogue, so that members of\r\nthe University and visitors may be able to inspect at one time and place\r\nall the books offered in any subject that may concern them. It is hoped\r\nto find room for separate exhibits of school-books, maps, and ‘juvenile’\r\nbooks, so that the busy schoolmaster, with half an hour to spare in\r\nOxford, may make a rapid survey of the contents of the Educational\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. _The Press and its Authors_\r\n\r\nThe Index to the General Catalogue contains the names of some three\r\nthousand living authors and editors. With almost all of these the Press\r\ndeals direct, and not through agents, and their friendly co-operation is\r\nof immense service to the Delegates and their officers both in planning\r\nbooks and in securing for them the widest publicity.\r\n\r\nMany of the books accepted by the Press are such as in the ordinary way\r\nof business would not secure a publisher except under subvention from the\r\nauthor or some favourer of learning; and of these the remuneration (or\r\nat least the direct remuneration; for the publication of solid books,\r\nlike the knowledge of Greek in former times, ‘not infrequently leads to\r\npositions of emolument’) is recognized as being nominal, and necessarily\r\ninadequate to the labour and skill lavished upon the work. But for books\r\ncommanding a remunerative sale, if they are of a suitable kind, the Press\r\nis prepared to pay the full market value; and it is believed that not\r\nmany of its authors are dissatisfied with the bargains they have made.\r\n\r\n‘It is an immense advantage to an author to be printed by a famous\r\nPress’, is the opinion of a veteran of letters, whose name appears in\r\nmany publishers’ catalogues. It is the aim of the Oxford Press to place\r\nat its authors’ service its capacity for accurate and beautiful printing\r\nand binding, the goodwill attached to the University imprint, and the\r\nselling power enjoyed by its very large organization in the United\r\nKingdom and throughout the world. Publication by the Press gives to\r\nan author the further security that his book will not be remaindered,\r\npulped, or allowed to go out of print on the mere ground that it does not\r\nenjoy a rapid sale.\r\n\r\nIt is still sometimes said that ‘the Press does not advertise’. It\r\nis believed that Oxford books, in an exceptional degree, advertise\r\nthemselves and each other—‘the Oxford book’, says an American\r\nadvertisement, ‘is half sold already’; but the magnitude and variety\r\nof its business enable the Press to maintain an elaborate organization\r\nof ‘publicity’, which directs its efforts both to the booksellers and\r\nto the public at large. It relies largely upon the distribution, in\r\nmany thousands of copies annually, of its catalogues and bulletins, on\r\nthe direct dispatch of prospectuses to a large yet carefully selected\r\nconstituency of buyers in various fields, and on the incalculable factor\r\nof public and private discussion. The value of judicious newspaper\r\nadvertisement is not overlooked, as readers of the _Times Literary\r\nSupplement_ well know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. _Bibles and Prayer Books_\r\n\r\nSome account has already been given of the exercise by the University\r\nof its privilege of printing ‘the King’s books’ in early times. The\r\nmodern history of the printing and publishing of the Bible and the\r\nBook of Common Prayer is a large subject. The University of Oxford,\r\nlike the other privileged printers, has appreciated the obligations\r\nattached to the privilege as well as the opportunities which it affords.\r\nEvery attention has been paid to accuracy and excellence of printing\r\nand binding, to the provision of editions suited to every purpose and\r\nevery eyesight, and to the efficient and economical distribution of\r\nthe books all over the world at low prices. In all these respects a\r\nstandard has been reached which is unknown in any other kind of printing\r\nand publishing, and which is only made possible by long experience,\r\ncontinuous production, and intensive specialization. The modern Bible\r\nis so convenient to read and to handle that its bulk is not always\r\nrealized; it is actually more than four times as long as _David\r\nCopperfield_. A reference Bible is, also, a highly complicated piece\r\nof printing. Accuracy is secured by the employment of highly-skilled\r\ncompositors and readers—a new Bible is ‘read’ from beginning to end many\r\ntimes—and by the use of the best material processes; for all Bibles are\r\nprinted from copper plates on the most modern machines, and the sheets\r\nare carefully scrutinized as they come from the press. The Oxford Press\r\noffers a guinea for the discovery of a misprint; but very few guineas\r\nhave been earned.\r\n\r\nThe bulk and weight of Bibles are kept down by the use of very thin and\r\nopaque paper, specially made at the Press Mill at Wolvercote. The use of\r\nsuch paper, and especially of the Oxford India paper, the combination in\r\nwhich of thinness with opacity has never been equalled, may be said to\r\nhave revolutionized the printing of Bibles, by making possible the use of\r\nlarge clear type in a book of moderate size and weight.\r\n\r\nOf the Prayer Book as of the Bible a large number of editions is offered\r\nto suit all fashions and purposes, and this in spite of the serious risks\r\narising from the liability to change of the ‘royal’ prayers. A demise of\r\nthe Crown, or the marriage of a Prince of Wales, makes it necessary to\r\nprint a large number of cancel sheets, which have to be substituted for\r\nthe old sheets in all copies held in stock or in the hands of booksellers.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago there were nineteen Oxford Bibles and twenty-one\r\neditions of the Book of Common Prayer. There are now more than a hundred\r\nof each. The Revised Version of the Bible, the copyright of which belongs\r\nto the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge jointly, is also published in\r\na large variety of editions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _Clarendon Press Books_\r\n\r\nBy Clarendon Press Books are meant the learned, educational, and other\r\n‘Standard’ works produced under the close supervision of the Delegates\r\nand their Oxford Secretariate, and printed at Oxford. These books have a\r\nlong history, and the Catalogue contains very many titles which have been\r\ncontinuously on sale for nearly a century. The Coptic New Testament of\r\nWilkins, published in 1716, is believed to have been continuously on sale\r\nat the original price of 12_s._ 6_d._ until the last copy was sold in\r\n1907, only a few years short of the second century. The current edition\r\nof the General Catalogue mentions as ‘the oldest Oxford book still on\r\nsale’ another edition of the Coptic New Testament by Woide, published in\r\n1799 and now sold for two guineas; but it has since been noticed that an\r\ninjustice had been done, and that pride of place should have been given\r\nto the Gothic Gospel, a magnificently printed quarto published in 1750,\r\nof which some dozen copies (at 30_s._) still remain.\r\n\r\nThese are extreme examples; they are, however, the result not of oblivion\r\nor of indifference, but of a policy which has long been and is still\r\nbeing pursued. The Press produces many works of learning which are so\r\nsecurely based that it is known that the demand, however small, will\r\npersist as long as there are copies unsold; and it is the practice of the\r\nPress to print from type large editions of such books. Clarendon Press\r\nbooks are neither wasted nor sold as remainders, and when a book goes\r\nout of print, some natural tears are shed.\r\n\r\nThis is one end of the scale; at the other are books commanding a large\r\nand rapid sale, books like the _Oxford Book of English Verse_ or the\r\n_Concise Oxford Dictionary_ and _livres de circonstance_ like _Why We are\r\nat War_, which was published in September 1914 and in a few months went\r\nthrough twelve impressions and was translated into six foreign languages.\r\nBooks of this kind are produced in mass, as cheaply as is consistent\r\nwith a high standard of workmanship, and are sold all over the world in\r\ncompetition with rival publications and by the employment of appropriate\r\nmethods of advertisement.\r\n\r\nBetween these two classes lies a great mass of miscellaneous books, too\r\ngeneral in character to admit of description here. They are in many\r\nlanguages, ancient and modern, of the East and of the West; of all\r\nfields of knowledge, divine, human, and natural; and of all stages of\r\nhistory from the Stone Age to the Great War. It follows necessarily that\r\nClarendon Press books appeal to widely different publics and call for the\r\napplication of various instruments of distribution and publicity. All,\r\nhowever, benefit by the widely diffused appreciation of the standards\r\nof scholarship and of literary form which the Press has set itself to\r\nuphold. The public expects much of any Oxford book, and the satisfaction\r\nof that expectation is often onerous; but the necessary effort is\r\njustified by the results—‘the Oxford book is half sold already’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS ABROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _The Press in India_\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Press in India are of relatively recent date.\r\nUntil 1912, when a branch was opened in Bombay, Oxford books had been\r\naccessible only to those who were determined to procure them. The\r\nexistence of a distributing centre made it possible to reach more\r\ndirectly the educational and the general public. But it early became\r\napparent to the Manager—Mr. E. V. Rieu of Balliol College—that the\r\neducational needs of India could only to a small extent be met by direct\r\nimportation; that it was necessary to adapt existing books to the special\r\nrequirements of the country, and to create new books similar in kind.\r\nIn the course of a few years many such books were produced, at first\r\nchiefly in England, but later to an increasing degree in India itself. By\r\n1918 at least a dozen native presses were engaged in printing and binding\r\nfor the Branch. These books range from ‘simplified classics’ to editions\r\nof Shakespeare’s plays, from school geographies to handbooks for students\r\nof medicine and law. At the same time the sale of more advanced Oxford\r\nbooks was largely increased. A brief description is given elsewhere of\r\nthe books produced at Oxford upon the history and art of India as well as\r\nupon its classical literature and its religions. Books like Mr. Vincent\r\nSmith’s _Early History of India_ and his _Fine Art in India_ command a\r\nwide sale among the educated natives of India.\r\n\r\nAnother field of enterprise is in vernacular education. Here the\r\nopportunities are vast, but the difficulties are great, for in most\r\nprovinces many languages are spoken, and no one press is adequately\r\nequipped with the numerous founts of type required to deal with the\r\nvernaculars of India as a whole. The Branch was therefore fortunate in\r\nbeing, in 1916, invited by the Government of the Central Provinces to\r\nproduce a series of Readers—in Hindi and Marathi—for use in schools\r\nthroughout the province. At that time no paper could be imported from\r\nEngland, and the staff of the Branch was depleted by war. Nevertheless,\r\nwithin a year over half a million volumes had been written, printed, and\r\nillustrated, and were ready for distribution over a country nearly twice\r\nas large as England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Branch in placing the issues of the War before\r\nIndian readers in a true light attracted in 1918 the attention of\r\nGovernment; and the Branch was engaged by the Central Publicity Bureau to\r\nproduce an illustrated War Magazine and a mass of pamphlets in English\r\nand the vernacular tongues.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these preoccupations the Branch has been able to emulate\r\nthe activities of the Press at home by co-operating with learned bodies\r\nin India to produce books of scientific value. Notable among its\r\npublications in this kind are the historical treatises of Mr. Rawlinson,\r\nMr. Kincaid, Mr. Mookerji, and other writers, and the economic studies\r\npublished on behalf of the Universities of Bombay and Madras.\r\n\r\nMention may also be made here of the _Classics of Indian History_ which\r\nare being issued by the Press. In reviewing the latest volume of the\r\nseries—Meadows Taylor’s _Story of My Life_—The Times Literary Supplement\r\nsays: ‘It is one of those books from which history hereafter will be\r\nwritten. The great books—in one sense or other—like Colonel Mark Wilks’s\r\n_Historical Sketches of Southern India_, Grant Duff’s _History of the\r\nMahrattas_, Tod’s _Rajasthan_, Broughton’s _Letters from a Mahratta\r\nCamp_, must be supplemented not only by the native records, which are\r\nmore and more becoming accessible, but by the personal narratives of\r\nEnglishmen who lived in out-of-the-way places and entered into the\r\nlives of the rural inhabitants of India. Beside Colonel Sleeman’s\r\n_Reminiscences_ must be put the autobiography of Meadows Taylor, a\r\nmuch superior book.’ Of the books mentioned by _The Times_, Sleeman’s\r\nand Tod’s have already been issued, uniform with Meadows Taylor’s,\r\nDubois’s _Hindu Manners_, Bernier’s _Travels_, Mrs. Meer Hassan Ali’s\r\n_Mussulmanns_, and Cunningham’s _Sikhs_; editions of Grant Duff and\r\nBroughton are in preparation.\r\n\r\nMr. Rieu, when in 1919 reasons of health compelled him to retire, had in\r\na few years proved himself a real pioneer. He had immensely increased\r\nthe volume of business done by the Branch, and had opened up new and\r\npromising fields. His successor, Major G. F. J. Cumberlege, D.S.O.,\r\nof Worcester College, who was accompanied by Mr. N. L. Carrington, of\r\nChrist Church, took over a successful and growing business. The original\r\npremises in Bombay had already been outgrown, and new offices opened in\r\nElphinstone Circle. The increase of staff has made it possible to open\r\na new branch in Calcutta—a sub-branch in Madras already existed—and it\r\nis confidently hoped that in the near future the business done in Oxford\r\nbooks, and adaptations of them, will be increased in volume, and that the\r\nservice rendered by Oxford to the Indian Empire will be further enhanced\r\nby the activities of its Press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOMBAY BRANCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TORONTO BRANCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Press in Canada_\r\n\r\nThe Oxford University Press Canadian Branch was founded in 1904 at 25\r\nRichmond Street West, Toronto. The manager was Mr. S. B. Gundy, who still\r\npresides at the same address; but the building was destroyed by fire in\r\n1905 and completely reconstructed.\r\n\r\nAlthough Canada has still a relatively small population, scattered\r\nover an immense area, the volume of business done by the Branch is\r\nsubstantial, and it continues to grow. The sale of Oxford Bibles,\r\nClarendon Press books, Medical and Elementary books is supplemented by\r\nthe sale of books published in Canada and the United States, for which\r\nMr. Gundy acts as agent. Thus the Branch sells all the publications of\r\nthe great American house of Doubleday, Page and Company; and through this\r\nconnexion it has recently become the sole publisher in Canada of the\r\nworks of Mr. Rudyard Kipling.\r\n\r\nAmong the more notable Canadian enterprises of the Press are the Church\r\nof England Hymn Book (the _Book of Common Praise_), published in\r\n1909, the large stocks of which caused Mr. Gundy ‘to overflow into a\r\nneighbouring barber shop’, and the new edition of the Presbyterian _Book\r\nof Praise_, produced in defiance of submarines and other obstacles in\r\n1917. The editor, the Rev. Alexander Macmillan, carried the manuscript\r\nacross the Atlantic in small packets sewn into his clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Press in Australasia_\r\n\r\nThis part of the business was first developed by visits regularly\r\nmade from London by Mr. E. R. Bartholomew, who in 1908 became manager\r\nof the Branch then established at Cathedral Buildings, Melbourne.\r\nAustralia is not only many thousands of miles from the great centres of\r\nbook-production, but is itself a land of great distances, as yet but\r\nsparsely populated; and this creates difficulties for both publishers and\r\nbooksellers. It is remarkable how far these obstacles have been overcome;\r\nand if regard is paid to the number and character of the population,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand no less, have a right to be proud of the\r\nquantity and quality of the books they buy.\r\n\r\nThe Branch has paid attention to the special needs of Australian\r\neducation, and in co-operation with the universities and schools has\r\nproduced a number of successful text-books.\r\n\r\nIt acts as agent for some of the leading British publishers, including\r\nthe houses of Murray, Heinemann, Black, Chapman and Hall, and Mowbray;\r\nand for the large publishing business of Messrs. Angus and Robertson of\r\nSydney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MELBOURNE BRANCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARKHAM’S BUILDINGS, CAPE TOWN\r\n\r\nin which the South African Branch is situated]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The Press in South Africa_\r\n\r\nThe South African Office of the Press is at Markham’s Buildings, Adderley\r\nStreet, Cape Town. Mr. C. R. Mellor, the present Representative, was\r\nappointed to that post in March 1915. From his office at Cape Town Mr.\r\nMellor visits the principal booksellers, not only in the Cape Province,\r\nbut in the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Natal.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _The Press in China_\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Agency of the Press is at C 445 Honan Road, Shanghai, of\r\nwhich Mr. T. Leslie is the present Representative. The first agent in\r\nChina for the Press was the Christian Literature Society of Shanghai, the\r\nagency being started in 1913. Mr. Leslie, who had been manager of that\r\nSociety, took over the Press agency in 1917. Stocks of all Oxford books\r\nlikely to be in demand in China are held in Shanghai.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Press in Scandinavia_\r\n\r\nFor many years before the war a traveller from Amen Corner visited the\r\nContinent annually, but business in Scandinavia developed so rapidly\r\nafter the Armistice that it was found desirable to open a Branch, and\r\npremises were accordingly secured in Copenhagen, Mr. H. Bohun Beet, the\r\nContinental traveller of the Press, being appointed manager. The Branch\r\nwas opened in August 1920, at St. Kongensgade 40 H, close to the King’s\r\nPalace. The Branch represents also Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton and the\r\nMedici Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _The Press in the United States_\r\n\r\nThe sale of Oxford books in the United States began long before the\r\nfoundation of the _American Branch_. It is recorded that ‘the growth of\r\nthe business was hindered by the Civil War, but after the restoration\r\nof peace it grew rapidly’; and that a landmark in its progress was the\r\npublication of editions of the American Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Oxford University Press American Branch, an\r\ninstitution which has made the name of Oxford familiar throughout the\r\nUnion, was due to the foresight and enterprise of Mr. Henry Frowde.\r\nActing on his advice the Delegates of the Press authorized the formation\r\nof a Corporation in the State of New York, and the Branch in 1896 opened\r\npremises at 91 Fifth Avenue, under the management of the late Mr. John\r\nArmstrong. In the following year Mr. Armstrong added to the Bibles and\r\nother books, previously sold by Messrs. Nelson, the Clarendon Press\r\npublications, previously sold by the Macmillan Company. The business\r\ngrew rapidly in Mr. Armstrong’s hands, and in 1908 moved ‘up town’ to\r\nthe premises it now occupies at 35 West 32nd Street. Mr. Armstrong died\r\nin 1915, and was succeeded by Mr. W. W. McIntosh, one of the original\r\nmembers of the staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRTY-SECOND STREET, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThe New York Branch is situated in the Central Building on the right]\r\n\r\nSHOW ROOMS AT THE NEW YORK BRANCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bible Show Room]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clarendon Press Show Room]\r\n\r\nThe main function of the Branch has always been that of keeping the\r\nAmerican public acquainted with Oxford books, both sacred and secular,\r\nand of supplying the books without avoidable delay. To this end it\r\nhas been necessary to hold large stocks in New York, and to maintain\r\nan expert staff which is in touch with the book-stores and with the\r\nuniversities, the schools, and the book-buying public at large. The\r\nBranch has its own catalogues and its own advertisements, and it has been\r\nable to make Oxford Bibles and Clarendon Press books known and valued\r\nthroughout the United States. The Branch, however, is not merely an\r\nimporter; it has long recognized that many Oxford products are capable\r\nof useful adaptation to special American requirements, and that such\r\nadaptation is consistent with the preservation of what Americans have\r\nthemselves called ‘the Oxford stamp’. This aspect of the activities of\r\nthe Press in America is shown by the large number of Bibles which are\r\nmanufactured (‘made’ is the American idiom) in the United States—among\r\nthese the now famous _Scofield_ Reference Bible is conspicuous—and also\r\nby books written—or at least rewritten—for American requirements. The\r\nBranch, in co-operation with American scholars, has produced valuable\r\nseries of text-books for schools and universities—the _Oxford English\r\nSeries_, the _Oxford French Series_, and the _Oxford German Series_.\r\nEven more important, perhaps, are adaptations of Oxford books of tried\r\nmerit. Thus the _Oxford Loose-Leaf Surgery_ derives from a (British)\r\nOxford original (one of the _Oxford Medical Publications_), but has\r\nimportant differences in substance as well as in its novel form. This\r\nvery successful work is now being followed by the _Oxford Loose-Leaf\r\nMedicine_, edited by Dr. Henry Christian and Sir James Mackenzie with\r\nthe help of leading physicians on both sides of the Atlantic. To promote\r\nco-operation of this kind in medical science was a great part of the\r\nlife-work of William Osler, who, as Regius Professor at Oxford, and a\r\nleading promoter of the Oxford Medical Publications, may be described as\r\nthe founder of the medical activities of the Oxford Press as they are now\r\ncarried on in Oxford, in London, in New York, and in Toronto.\r\n\r\nAnother work of adaptation, now in progress, illustrates further the\r\npossibilities of Anglo-American co-operation. The _Concise Oxford\r\nDictionary_ of current English, adapted from the great Oxford Dictionary,\r\nhas been and is very widely used throughout the British Empire and by\r\nstudents of English in foreign countries. But its spelling, and certain\r\nother features, were found to disqualify the book for general use in the\r\nUnited States; and a special American edition is now in preparation, the\r\nadapter of which is Mr. G. Van Santvoord, of Oriel College, Oxford, and\r\nYale University.\r\n\r\nThe Press is publisher, on both sides of the Atlantic, to the Carnegie\r\nEndowment for International Peace, many of whose books have been printed\r\nat Oxford. Special mention may be made of the first volumes, printed\r\nat the Press and recently published, of the British Section of the\r\ngreat _Economic and Social History of the World War_ undertaken by the\r\nEndowment. These volumes are by Professors Keith and Bowley and Mr. J. A.\r\nSalter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOXFORD BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Oxford Series_\r\n\r\nAt one time Oxford books were produced almost always at the instance\r\nof an author; and many Oxford books are still so produced. A scholar\r\nhaving devoted, it may be, many years of his life to a subject which\r\nhe has made his own, applies to the University Press for publication\r\nof his researches; and such a claim is often admitted as irresistible.\r\nIn modern times, however, the need for organization by the publisher\r\nhas become increasingly apparent. Many books which if published in\r\nisolation would reach only a small public are found capable of a wider\r\nusefulness when issued as part of a larger plan; and thus the initiative\r\nin publishing passes more and more into the hands of the professional\r\ncommanding the advice of a body of experts. School-books, reprints of\r\nthe Classics, text-books of the applied sciences, and books of the nature\r\nof Dictionaries and Encyclopaedias are now almost always conducted in\r\nthis way by co-operative enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe number of such homogeneous series promoted by the Press during the\r\nlast twenty years is large, even if all school-books are excluded. The\r\n_Oxford English Dictionary_ (which is of earlier origin) bulks so large\r\nin the public eye as somewhat to obscure all humbler enterprises; but\r\nit does not stand alone. In English literature the Press has built up\r\nin a quarter of a century a whole library of uniform series, all of\r\nrespectable dimensions. The _Oxford English Texts_ are library editions\r\nof famous authors edited after exhaustive examination of the materials,\r\nin print and in manuscript, and handsomely printed from type; the _Tudor\r\nand Stuart Library_ consists of first editions and exact reprints of\r\nfamous books of that period, printed in the types of the period on\r\npaper calculated to last for many centuries more; these books are now\r\nfinding their way into the second-hand catalogues and the collections\r\nof connoisseurs; the _Oxford Library of Prose and Poetry_ is a series\r\nof little books for fanciers, offering especially the classics of the\r\nRomantic Revival in a form approximating to that of the originals; the\r\n_Oxford Poets_ claim to be the last word for accuracy of text, condensed\r\nyet fine printing, and the lowest price compatible with these qualities;\r\nthe _Oxford Standard Authors_ offer the same texts as the Oxford Poets,\r\ntogether with many prose classics, in a cheaper form; the average volume\r\ncontaining nearly 600 pages of close yet legible print. Finally, the\r\n_World’s Classics_ furnish a collection of over two hundred of the most\r\nfamous English books in a very handy form, still maintained in print\r\nas far as possible in spite of the costs of production, which make it\r\nincreasingly difficult to keep any but the most popular books on sale in\r\na cheap series.\r\n\r\nNone of these series has been created by the simple expedient of taking\r\nan existing edition and sending it to the printer—a plan too commonly\r\nfollowed, as is well known to every one who has ever investigated the\r\ntext of a well-known author, and has found that each edition contains\r\nalmost all the errors of its predecessors and adds fresh errors of its\r\nown. The Oxford texts are the result of the laborious co-operation\r\nof editor, publisher, and printer, involving the choice of the most\r\nauthoritative original—very often the collation of a number of printed\r\noriginals and sometimes of manuscripts as well—expert attention to\r\nthe problems both editorial and typographical of which the successful\r\nsolution produces a well-designed book, and finally scrupulous diligence\r\nin the elimination of error. The substantial accuracy of Oxford texts is\r\nwidely recognized, and is known to be due to the united vigilance of the\r\neditors, the publishers (themselves scholars and sometimes editors), and\r\nthe printers. It is less well known how complex and difficult are the\r\nproblems which the modern editor has to solve. The scientific editing\r\nof English texts is indeed a relatively recent growth, and depends upon\r\nthe application of principles which in the field of Greek and Latin\r\ntextual criticism have been elaborated in the course of centuries. It\r\nis thus no accident that the work done in English editing in the last\r\nfive-and-twenty years has been largely in the hands of scholars trained\r\nin the Oxford school of _Literae Humaniores_, and has synchronized with\r\nthe production of the _Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis_.\r\n\r\nThis series, now popularly known as the _Oxford Classical Texts_, is the\r\nonly large series of critical texts of Greek and Latin authors produced\r\nin recent times outside Germany and able to hold its own in competition\r\nwith its great German rivals. The texts, which now fill nearly eighty\r\nvolumes and include the most important writers of the ‘classical’\r\nperiods of Greek and Roman literature, have been based upon much fresh\r\nexamination of the manuscript originals. Some of the editors, indeed,\r\nhave devoted years to this kind of investigation; the labours of Mr.\r\nAllen on the manuscripts of Homer and of Professor Clark and Sir William\r\nPeterson on those of Cicero have secured for their authors a permanent\r\nplace in the long history of classical scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the series is to give the best text which the examination\r\nof the manuscripts in their relation to each other affords, and to\r\nprovide in a brief _apparatus criticus_ sufficient information to show\r\nthe evidence on which the editor has based his decision. Conjectural\r\nemendations are mentioned in the notes when they are considered\r\nplausible, but are not admitted to the text except where they reach\r\na high degree of probability. This principle, which is mainly due to\r\nthe authority of the late Ingram Bywater, has commended itself in the\r\ncourse of years even to those who were at first disposed to think it too\r\naustere, and has greatly enhanced the permanent value of the series,\r\nwhich before the war was finding its way into Germany itself. A famous\r\nGerman publisher went so far indeed as to address to Oxford (on the eve\r\nof the war) a letter of remonstrance on the price of the series, which\r\nwas described as too low for its value.\r\n\r\nThe _Oxford Library of Translations_ consists mainly of prose versions\r\nof Greek and Latin authors. These have not been made to order or in\r\naccordance with any single principle of translation, but have been\r\nproduced at the instance of scholars unable to deny themselves the\r\nsatisfaction of translating a favourite author. This, which is perhaps\r\nthe best guarantee of excellence, accounts for the miscellaneous\r\nconstitution of the series, which has been enlarged by degrees as a happy\r\nconjunction of author and translator chanced to present itself, and from\r\nthe same cause admits some interesting authors seldom or never included\r\nin series of translations made upon a less elastic plan.\r\n\r\nAnother series of translations is the great collection of the _Sacred\r\nBooks of the East_, which was begun many years ago by the late Max Müller\r\nand reached its fiftieth and concluding volume in 1910. The value of\r\nthese translations to Orientalists is shown by the steady sale, which\r\nafter forty years is still increasing, and by the high prices asked for\r\nthe few volumes which are now unfortunately out of print.\r\n\r\nHistory, and the subjects akin thereto, afford less scope for homogeneous\r\nseries than does the editing of ancient and modern classical literature;\r\nand it has been the policy of the Press rather to secure monographs of\r\nunique authority in special fields than to compile works of encyclopaedic\r\ninformation. A few examples will serve to illustrate the range and\r\nimportance of the Oxford books produced in this way which have become\r\nclassics in their subject: in the History of Antiquity, Sir Arthur\r\nEvans’s _Scripta Minoa_, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson’s _Palaeography_,\r\nVincent Smith’s _Early History of India_; in the Fine Arts, Barclay\r\nHead’s _Historia Numorum_, Vincent Smith’s _Fine Art in India_, Dalton’s\r\n_Byzantine Art_; in Constitutional History and Law, Anson’s _Law and\r\nCustom of the Constitution_ and _Law of Contract_, Sir Courtenay\r\nIlbert’s _Government of India_, Lord Bryce’s _Studies in History and\r\nJurisprudence_, Hall’s _International Law_, Prof. Keith’s _Responsible\r\nGovernment_, Sir Erskine Holland’s _Jurisprudence_; in British History,\r\nStubbs’s _Constitutional History of England_, Freeman’s _Norman\r\nConquest_, Sir Paul Vinogradoff’s _Villainage in England_ and _English\r\nSociety in the Eleventh Century_, Sir Charles Oman’s _Peninsular War_; in\r\nEuropean History, Finlay’s _Greece_, Hodgkin’s _Italy and Her Invaders_;\r\nin Geography, Prof. Beazley’s _Dawn of Modern Geography_ and Mr. R. L.\r\nPoole’s great _Historical Atlas_.\r\n\r\nBooks of this kind best represent the type at which Oxford has aimed\r\nin the historical and human sciences, and it is to the promotion of\r\nsuch works that the resources of the Press have in this field been most\r\nadvantageously applied. When, however, the progress of a subject and\r\nthe enthusiasm of an editor have combined to suggest another way, the\r\nopportunity has been taken of organizing research upon a common plan.\r\nNotable results of such combined endeavour are the _Oxford Survey of the\r\nBritish Empire_ and the _Historical Geography of the Dominions_ promoted\r\nby the late Prof. Herbertson and by Sir Charles Lucas of the Colonial\r\nOffice respectively. The former work, containing in six volumes a general\r\nand a particular survey of the geographical, economic, and administrative\r\naspects of the Empire and its constituent parts, was completed within a\r\nshort time and published within a few weeks of the outbreak of the war.\r\nIn an important sense therefore it cannot become out of date, since it\r\naffords a conspectus of conditions as they existed at the culmination\r\nof the former age, to which it will always be necessary to refer as a\r\nstandard of comparison. The other series, which is in seven volumes\r\n(comprising twice as many separate parts), has had a longer and more\r\nchequered history, the march of events since the early years of the\r\ncentury, when publication began, having made necessary frequent revision\r\nand reconstitution. The work is still in progress, and India has recently\r\nbeen added to its scope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA more recent collection arose out of the demand during the war for a\r\ncompendious survey of the history of the belligerent powers. To satisfy\r\nthe demand was one of the pieces of war work undertaken by the Press,\r\nand the evident usefulness of the volumes having survived the war has\r\nled to the establishment of a series on a permanent and wider plan,\r\nincluding Histories of the Nations and treatises of similar scope on\r\nleading questions of International politics. The series now covers\r\nFrance, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, the Balkans, Serbia, Russia, Prussia,\r\nChina, and Japan, with books on the Eastern Question, Diplomacy,\r\nNineteenth-Century Treaties, and other topics. Many of the volumes have\r\nbeen frequently reprinted, and additions are in preparation.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting of Oxford books written by a number of\r\ncontributors on a uniform plan is _Shakespeare’s England, an Account\r\nof the Life and Manners of his Age_, published in two volumes in the\r\ncentenary year 1916. The book contains an Ode by the Poet Laureate, a\r\nlong essay on the Age of Elizabeth by Sir Walter Raleigh, and some forty\r\nspecial articles by the first authorities.\r\n\r\nAnother co-operative enterprise is the _Oxford History of Music_, which\r\nin six volumes surveys the whole subject from the beginning to the time\r\nof Wagner; it is not a collection of biographies, but a history of music\r\nas such—of origins, tendencies, and evolution. The authors include the\r\nlate H. E. Wooldridge, the late Sir Hubert Parry, and Sir Henry Hadow,\r\nwhose enlightened enthusiasm has done so much for the study of music in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Oxford Books on the Empire_\r\n\r\nOxford is proud to consider itself as _par excellence_ the Imperial\r\nUniversity. The administration of the Empire owes much to Oxford men, as\r\nthe University in its turn owes much to her sons from overseas. Imperial\r\nsubjects are an important and growing branch of study at Oxford; and\r\nthe Press, true to its tradition of building upon the foundations of\r\nexperience, has in time put together an imposing collection as well of\r\nthe classics of colonization and administration as of new and original\r\ntreatises by scholars versed in its theory and practice. These books\r\nbeing very diverse have not been confined within the limits of a series\r\nuniform in size or appearance; but they have a real unity, and deserve\r\nit is believed to be acquired as a whole by every library with any\r\npretensions to an imperial character. Among the most important volumes\r\nmay be enumerated Wakefield’s _View of the Art of Colonization_, first\r\npublished in 1849, Lord Durham’s _Report on British North America_,\r\nCornewall Lewis’s _Government of Dependencies_; and (among modern\r\ntreatises) Prof. Keith’s _Responsible Government_ (in its present form\r\npublished as recently as 1912, yet already an established classic), and\r\nthe same author’s _Imperial Unity_, Prof Egerton’s _Federations and\r\nUnions_, Sir Courtenay Ilbert’s _Government of India_.\r\n\r\nThe Press is so strong in books on _India_ that it has seemed well to\r\nissue a special catalogue bringing together a mass of books which in the\r\nGeneral Catalogue are listed under a variety of subject-headings. These\r\ninclude a large and important section published by the Press under the\r\npatronage of the Secretary of State—notably the _Imperial Gazetteer of\r\nIndia_ in twenty-six volumes, the noble series of documents on the early\r\nhistory of ‘John Company’ compiled at the India Office, and the sumptuous\r\npublication of Sir Aurel Stein’s discoveries in Turkestan; but they\r\ninclude also a whole library of books produced by the Press at its sole\r\ncharges and dealing with the history of India from the Empire of Asoka to\r\nthe formulation of Dyarchy, with the geography, politics, and economics\r\nof modern India, and with the religion and literature, the fine art, and\r\nthe music of Hindostan. The production by the Press in India itself of\r\nvernacular and other educational books has recently made great progress.\r\n(See also p. 65 for some notice of the series of _Classics of Indian\r\nHistory_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Oxford Standard_\r\n\r\nThe standard of scholarship, accuracy, and literary excellence which\r\nthe Delegates maintain in the books published under their authority\r\nis believed to be as high as that attempted by any other publisher\r\nin the world. Its maintenance imposes upon the Delegates much labour\r\nand expense; but the effort is repaid in the reputation which Oxford\r\nbooks enjoy in the public estimation. The supervision exercised by the\r\nDelegates, both personally and through their advisers, is not limited to\r\nthe initial judgement passed upon a book offered to them for publication;\r\nit extends through the whole process of revision in manuscript and\r\nin proof. When a book is favourably considered, an expert’s detailed\r\nreport is very often laid before the author, who is asked to consider\r\nthe suggestions made and to confer with the Delegates’ advisers; and\r\nthis process of scrutiny is frequently far-reaching, the criticism being\r\ninvited at one stage or another of a number of specialists in various\r\nfields. In this way many, perhaps most, of the books produced by the\r\nPress have received substantial improvement; and not a few have undergone\r\nsomething like transformation. To these benefits abundant testimony is\r\nborne in the prefaces of authors; more, perhaps, reposes in the archives\r\nin Walton Street.\r\n\r\nThe technical services rendered to scholarship by the Clarendon Press\r\nproof-readers are likewise commemorated in many a preface. The late\r\nMr. J. C. Pembrey, who in 1847 read Wilson’s _Sanskrit Grammar_, and\r\nin 1916 read Prof. Macdonell’s _Vedic Grammar_ for press, was well\r\nknown to three generations of Oriental scholars; the late Mr. W. F. R.\r\nShilleto did much to secure accuracy and uniformity in the series of\r\n_Oxford Classical Texts_; and Mr. George Ostler has left the marks of\r\nhis vigilance upon many editions of the English classics. Long training\r\nin a severe school develops unusual powers; and authors are sometimes\r\nstartled by instances of what seems beyond natural acumen. An author who\r\nhad misquoted _Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis_ in the usual\r\nform, was naturally astonished when the reader inquired in the margin\r\n‘Should it not be _et nos_?’, which is of course unmetrical. The reader\r\nwas right, nevertheless; but the source of his information remained\r\nobscure. In fields less recondite than this the authority of the readers\r\nis generally recognized; many editors have confessed that in the matter\r\nof Greek accents they should not think of disputing it.\r\n\r\nThe attention thus paid to the claims of scholarship and accuracy brings\r\ndoubtless unmixed benefits to learning and education. To the Press as\r\na business concern the blessing is less unequivocal. The Delegates’\r\nresources are not without limits; and they are sometimes embarrassed by\r\nthe ambitions of learned authors from all parts of the world, to whom\r\nnothing but the imprint of the Clarendon Press seems an adequate reward.\r\nThey are obliged to pick and choose, and sometimes to decline a proposal\r\nwhich would attract them if it had fewer rivals. Another imputation is\r\nless deserved. A distinguished American who had been invited to dine in\r\nan Oxford College confessed afterwards that as he entered the room his\r\nknees knocked at the thought that ‘all these Fellows talked Latin’;\r\nand the public is sometimes frightened away from an Oxford book by the\r\napprehension that it will be found full of Greek quotations. There is in\r\nfact no necessary connexion between accuracy and pedantry; and even Dons\r\nare often men of the world, well acquainted with the limitations of the\r\naverage intelligence. No one need be afraid that an Oxford book on any\r\nordinary subject will be any more abstruse than another book, though its\r\nfacts will perhaps be better authenticated and its arguments more closely\r\nreasoned. The booksellers know this; and in reply to a customer’s inquiry\r\n‘Is this a good book?’ have been heard to reply ‘Why it’s an Oxford book’.\r\n\r\nAnother fallacy which dies hard is that Oxford books are dear. This\r\nis perhaps no more than a hasty inference from the fact that Oxford\r\nproduces an exceptionally large proportion of books which from their\r\nnature cannot be cheap. No one would expect to buy Liddell and Scott’s\r\nGreek Lexicon, or the _Index Kewensis_, for a few shillings; but these\r\nbooks and many like them are really inexpensive, if regard is paid to\r\nthe number of words they contain. The Oxford Dictionary itself is sold\r\nat an almost nominal price. Many of the books, however, which appeal to\r\na narrow public are properly priced higher than if they could be sold in\r\nlarge numbers; for the price of a book depends mainly upon two things—the\r\nnumber of words it contains and the number of people who will buy it.\r\nThe art of publishing lies in nothing so much as in estimating whether a\r\nbook is more likely to sell say, 750 copies at 15_s._ or 5,000 at 5_s._\r\nThe policy of the Press has always been elastic in this respect; and very\r\nmany of its books are among the cheapest in their kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Specimen of work done by M.

R. L. Fletcher and Rudyard Kipling, 1911]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _Illustrated Books_\r\n\r\nThe publication by the Press of beautifully illustrated books is mainly\r\na development of comparatively recent years, and it has been furthered\r\nby the progress of collotype printing at Oxford. The catalogue now\r\nincludes a large number of sumptuous monographs on artistic subjects.\r\nIn its facsimiles of manuscripts and rare printed books, published on\r\nits own account or for the British Museum, the Press has done much to\r\nmake accessible to scholars the treasures of the great collections.\r\nWell-known examples are the magnificent collotype reproduction of the\r\nNew Testament part of the _Codex Sinaiticus_ (from negatives made at St.\r\nPetersburg under the old régime; negatives were fortunately made of the\r\nOld Testament part as well, and the reproduction of the whole of this\r\nmost famous of all manuscripts will before long be completed); and the\r\ncomplete collotype reproduction of the Shakespearian corpus, consisting\r\nof the Folio of 1623, which went out of print on publication in 1912, and\r\nthe _Poems and Pericles_ from the first editions, still on sale.\r\n\r\nThe Press has also published very numerous reproductions of works of\r\nart of all kinds, partly by way of illustrated catalogues of special\r\ncollections or _genres_ (such as the three folio volumes of Oxford\r\nDrawings by the old masters, the numerous coin catalogues, and the cheap\r\ncollection of British Historical Portraits in half-tone); partly in\r\nthe form of profusely illustrated monographs, which moreover are all\r\nscientific works by experts and not mere collections of pretty pictures\r\nwith illustrative letterpress.\r\n\r\nThese works are of great importance to students and collectors, and a\r\nselect list is appended: Head’s _Historia Numorum_, Gardner’s _Ancient\r\nCoinage_, Beazley’s and other books on Greek Vases, Hill’s _Renaissance\r\nMedals_, Dalton’s _Byzantine Art_, Maunde Thompson’s _Palaeography_,\r\nMurray’s _History of Chess_, ffoulkes’s _Armour and Weapons_, Rivoira’s\r\n_Moslem Architecture_, Vincent Smith’s _Fine Art in India_, Sir Aurel\r\nStein’s _Khotan_ and _Serindia_ and other special works on Eastern Art,\r\nthe important series of monographs on English Church Art written or\r\nedited by the late Francis Bond, with his comprehensive _Introduction to\r\nEnglish Church Architecture_ in two volumes, and many more too numerous\r\nto cite, particularly the great wealth of British Museum catalogues.\r\nA very welcome recent accession to the catalogue is supplied by the\r\nsumptuous monographs on Italian Masters produced by the Harvard and\r\nPrinceton University Presses.\r\n\r\nThe use of illustration is, however, by no means confined to facsimiles\r\nand works on the arts. The modern productions of the Press have made an\r\nincreasing use of illustration both as an embellishment and as a medium\r\nof information. School-books in particular are now lavishly illustrated\r\nwith portraits, maps, diagrams, and other reproductions, often either of\r\nmodern photographs or of old cuts and engravings carefully chosen, so\r\nthat the actual men and things of former times may be faithfully mirrored.\r\n\r\nThe Press prints for the British Museum and other London collections,\r\nas well as for the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, very large numbers of\r\npostcards in collotype, by means of which a knowledge of our national art\r\ntreasures is being widely spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Official Publications_\r\n\r\nThe Press prints for the official purposes of the University the\r\n_University Gazette_ (recording the official Acts and Agenda of the\r\nUniversity), the annual _Calendar_ (primarily a list of the members\r\nof the University), the _Statuta Universitatis_ and the _Examination\r\nStatutes_ (both published every year), and a number of smaller\r\npamphlets &c. giving special information. The numerous and far-reaching\r\nchanges, made necessary by the war and the fruits of the war, have\r\nhitherto precluded the republication of the useful and popular _Oxford\r\nUniversity Handbook_, last published in 1915. Meanwhile, the pamphlet\r\nof General_ Information_ (on admission, residence, scholarships, and\r\nsome examinations) will be found valuable by those, at home and abroad,\r\nwho wish to form a general conception of the opportunities afforded to\r\nstudents and the requirements which they must fulfil.\r\n\r\nThere are many other official books, both utilitarian and antiquarian.\r\nEmployers and others have often occasion to inquire what places a member\r\nof the University obtained in the class-lists. The information, not\r\nalways available elsewhere, is given, from the beginning to 1900, in\r\nthe _Historical Register of the University_, and for the years 1901-20,\r\nin the _Supplement_ to that work recently published. Benefactors and\r\nothers interested in University Finance are directed to the _Abstract of\r\nthe Accounts of the University and Colleges_ published annually. Other\r\npublications of local usefulness include the _Oxford University Pocket\r\nDiary_ for the academical year, and the terminal list of all _Resident\r\nMembers of the University_ (with addresses, telephone numbers, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe University twice during the war printed its _Roll of Service_, and in\r\n1920 published the third and definitive edition: it contains the names,\r\nfourteen thousand five hundred and sixty-one in number, of those members\r\nof the University who served in the Military and Naval forces of the\r\nCrown. The names of those who gave their lives, two thousand four hundred\r\nand seventy-four in number, are distinguished by heavy type.\r\n\r\n_The Oxford University Almanack_ has been printed annually since 1674,\r\nand of the illustrations since 1716 the Press possesses the original\r\nplates. By far the greater number are still on sale. Many of the recent\r\nplates are of great interest and beauty; those for 1906-10, and that\r\nfor 1918, are collotypes from drawings made for the Almanack by Mr.\r\nMuirhead Bone; most of the later issues are chromo-collotypes reproducing\r\nwater-colour drawings, preserved at Oxford, by J. M. W. Turner and other\r\nartists of his time.\r\n\r\nThe historical books dealing with Oxford and published by the Press\r\ninclude Mr. Madan’s _Oxford Books_, ‘1468’-1650, a work much esteemed by\r\nbibliographers; Mr. Shadwell’s _Enactments in Parliament_ (concerning\r\nOxford, Cambridge, Winchester, Eton, and Westminster); Mrs. Poole’s\r\nthree volumes (one is out of print) of illustrated catalogues of Oxford\r\nPortraits (all these published for, or in co-operation with, the Oxford\r\nHistorical Society); and, in a lighter vein, Mr. Lamborn’s popular\r\n_Story of Architecture in Oxford Stone_ and handy guides, written by\r\nexperts, to the Bodleian, other Oxford Libraries, the Ashmolean Museum,\r\nthe University Museum (of Natural Science), and the picturesque Degree\r\nCeremony (by the Warden of Wadham). The Press offers also a _History of\r\nOxford Rowing_, and the collected _Orationes_ of the late Public Orator,\r\nDr. W. W. Merry, perhaps the only man of modern times who could make a\r\nLatin speech intelligible to an audience of undergraduates and ladies.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon’s work on _University Reform_ published in 1909 is still on\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Oxford English Dictionary_\r\n\r\nThe work described on its title-page as _A New English Dictionary\r\non Historical Principles,_ and long known familiarly as _N.E.D._ or\r\n_Murray’s Dictionary_, but now generally as the _Oxford Dictionary_,\r\nhas a continuous history of more than half a century. It was in 1857\r\nthat Dean Trench (afterwards Archbishop Trench) laid the foundation\r\nof the work by calling the attention of the Philological Society to\r\nthe inadequacy of all existing English Dictionaries. He pointed out\r\nthat thousands of words which had become obsolete, but remained in the\r\nnational literature, had either escaped the diligence of lexicographers\r\nor had been excluded by the limitations of their plan; and in especial\r\nthat no dictionary gave any account of the _history_ of words and their\r\nsenses; in none was it ascertained when a word was first used, when (if\r\nobsolete) it had last been used, and how its senses had been developed.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Philological Society threw themselves eagerly into\r\nthe plan proposed for supplying these deficiencies, and an army of\r\nvolunteers set about the systematic examination of the whole body of\r\nEnglish literature. At length a dictionary was projected (in place of the\r\nsupplement first suggested, which it was realized would be much larger\r\nthan the works it was designed to supplement), and Mr. Herbert Coleridge\r\nwas appointed editor. Fresh volunteers were enlisted, and the work made\r\nprogress. But it could hardly have taken shape without the tireless\r\nindustry and indomitable courage of the next editor, Dr. Furnivall, who\r\nsaw, but did not shrink from, the immense preparatory labours yet to\r\nbe faced. Furnivall realized that an English Dictionary could not be\r\nmade until the roots of the language could be examined in the mass of\r\nour early literature, which was then hardly known; and to provide this\r\nessential he founded in 1864 the _Early English Text Society_—the long\r\nlist of whose publications, still growing, may be read in the Clarendon\r\nPress Catalogue.\r\n\r\nBut even the enthusiasm of a Furnivall did not avail to prevent a growing\r\nsense of despondency, when the work seemed to lengthen out indefinitely\r\nwith no promise of performance. No private publisher could be found to\r\nundertake a work so vast. It was decided to invite the co-operation of\r\nthe Clarendon Press. The Philological Society and Dr. James Murray, who\r\nhad thrown himself into the work with an energy equal to Furnivall’s own,\r\nand was by acclamation designated as editor, entered into negotiations\r\nwith the Delegates of the Press, and an agreement was signed.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that the magnitude of human undertakings is seldom\r\nperceived by those who engage upon them. Coleridge had intimated that it\r\nwould be time to begin the Dictionary when a hundred thousand quotations\r\nhad been pigeon-holed. The efforts of Furnivall and Murray brought the\r\ntotal to three and a half million quotations, selected by thirteen\r\nhundred readers from the works of five thousand authors. The work of\r\naccumulation has gone on for forty years since, and to-day the Dictionary\r\ncontains about one and three-quarter million _printed_ quotations,\r\nselected from a greatly larger number. Dr. Murray himself agreed with\r\nthe Delegates for a work of between 6,000 and 7,000 pages. The total will\r\nexceed 15,000. He expected to complete the book in ten years with a small\r\nstaff. To-day, thirty-five years after printing began, the work, to which\r\nMurray himself contributed more than 7,000 pages, is being carried on by\r\nthree editors with twelve assistants; and the end is not yet.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to value too highly the services of voluntary helpers\r\nfrom the beginning to the present day. The completeness and accuracy of\r\nthe work, which is probably without a rival in any country or in any age,\r\ncould not have been secured except by editors of the greatest learning\r\nand ability and by the training of a lifetime; but these qualities\r\nwould not have availed if the work had not been founded upon inductive\r\ninvestigations of a range never before attempted. For the wealth of the\r\nmaterials made available our gratitude is due to readers not only in the\r\nUnited Kingdom but in all parts of the world, and notably in the United\r\nStates of America, where the Dictionary is regarded with affectionate\r\nadmiration as the common achievement of the English-speaking people.\r\n\r\nValuable, however, as the work of these voluntary helpers has been,\r\nan even larger debt of gratitude is due to the faithful labours of\r\nthe editorial staff of assistants, some of whom can trace back their\r\nterm of service to the earliest years of the undertaking. To their\r\nacumen, vigilance, and zeal have been and are due in large measure\r\nthe completeness of the evidence and the correctness of detail in the\r\npresentation of words and their meanings.\r\n\r\nDr. Murray with his staff moved to Oxford in 1885, and there the work\r\nhas been continuously carried on, partly in the _Scriptorium_ attached\r\nto Dr. Murray’s house, partly (and in recent years wholly) in the _Old\r\nAshmolean Building_, next door to the old Sheldonian Press and within\r\na stone’s throw of the Bodleian. Here, as a section of the alphabet\r\ncomes to be treated, the material is sifted, extracts from it are put\r\nin order, fresh investigations, often laborious, are undertaken to\r\nsettle etymologies and doubtful points in the history of a word; copy\r\nis prepared for the printer, and references are checked. The complete\r\npreparation of the material involves researches of the most varied\r\nnature, some of which lead the editors even beyond the confines of our\r\nown language to novel and important discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Dictionary, in the form which it finally assumed, is\r\nthus stated in the preface to Volume I:—‘The aim of this dictionary is\r\nto furnish an adequate account of the meaning, origin, and history of\r\nEnglish words now in general use, or known to have been in use at any\r\ntime during the last seven hundred years. It endeavours (1) to show, with\r\nregard to each individual word, when, how, in what shape, and with what\r\nsignification, it became English; what development of form and meaning it\r\nhas since received; which of its uses have, in the course of time, become\r\nobsolete, and which still survive; what new uses have since arisen, by\r\nwhat processes, and when: (2) to illustrate these facts by a series of\r\nquotations ranging from the first known occurrence of the word to the\r\nlatest, or down to the present day; the word being thus made to exhibit\r\nits own history and meaning: and (3) to treat the etymology of each word\r\nstrictly on the basis of historical fact, and in accordance with the\r\nmethods and results of modern philological science.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF THE OLD ASHMOLEAN]\r\n\r\nAs the history of many English words begins with the Anglo-Saxon period,\r\nand the ‘first known occurrence’ may be as early as the seventh century,\r\nthe period actually covered by hundreds of the articles in the Dictionary\r\nis one of ten, eleven, or twelve centuries.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the aim of the Dictionary has been accomplished\r\nis not yet so widely known as it ought to be. Many discussions as to\r\nthe origin, history, and meaning of words are carried on in newspapers\r\nand periodicals which could be decided at once by a reference to the\r\nDictionary. Inquirers spend much of their own and others’ time, and in\r\nthe end write to one of the editors, in quest of information which has\r\nfor years been available in the published volumes. Nor is it solely the\r\nstudent of language who can profit by the use of the Dictionary, although\r\nin this respect it is of unique value both for English and Continental\r\nphilologists. Every scholar and scientist is likely to find in it some\r\nfresh light upon his own subject, for many special points in the history\r\nand terminology of the various sciences have for the first time been\r\nelucidated in its pages.\r\n\r\nThe reputation, however, of the Dictionary is now so widely spread that\r\nit would be superfluous to call witnesses to its unique qualities and its\r\nprofound usefulness. In the legislature and in the law courts, as well as\r\nin the library and the market place, its ruling on the meanings and use\r\nof words is accepted as final. Nor is the range of the work limited in\r\nthis respect to the usage of the United Kingdom; it embraces all forms of\r\nthe language sanctioned as standard by literary use, wherever English is\r\nspoken and written.\r\n\r\nFor these and other reasons no proper comparison can be made with any\r\nother English dictionary; but the magnitude of the result may none the\r\nless be gauged by means of these. Taking one of the ten volumes as a\r\nbasis of comparison, the seventh, comprising words beginning with O and\r\nP, has nearly 49,000 words (of which over 5,000 are obsolete and nearly\r\n2,000 are naturalized aliens). No other English dictionary has more than\r\n27,000 words beginning with O and P. When comparison is made of the\r\nnumber of illustrative quotations, the difference is overwhelming; Vol.\r\nVII has 175,000 quotations, and no other dictionary has much more than\r\n20,000 for the same sections of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nIf it is thought that, great as the work is, it has taken an inordinate\r\ntime to produce, comfort may be taken from the fate of comparable\r\nenterprises abroad. The great _Deutsches Wörterbuch_ started by the\r\nbrothers Grimm in 1838 began to be printed as long ago as 1851, and thus\r\nhad a start of over thirty years; but though it is only some two-thirds\r\nof the scale of the Oxford book, there still after sixty-seven years\r\nremains about a sixth to do. The Dutch _Woordenboek_ is less advanced,\r\nand the dictionary of the Swedish Academy has not passed the letter D.\r\n\r\nThe state of the work to-day is that of the ten volumes nine are\r\npublished, and of the tenth (Ti-Z) substantial parts are complete, namely\r\nTi-Ty, and V, X Y Z, and the first sections of U and W. The end, however,\r\nis not so near as might be thought; U is a large section, and W is in\r\nmany respects the most difficult letter in the alphabet, consisting as\r\nit does almost entirely of words of Teutonic origin, and therefore of\r\nobscure etymology and complicated history. A lexicographer makes light\r\nwork of _parallelepiped_ and _supralapsarian_; it is when he comes to\r\nwords like _wealth_ and _work_, _war_ and _waste_, _wild_ and _wilful_,\r\nthat his powers of discovery and of discrimination are seriously taxed.\r\n\r\nSir James Murray (he was knighted in 1908) died 26 July 1915. His\r\nambition to see the completion of the work on his eightieth birthday in\r\n1917 was not fulfilled, and even if he had lived to devote to it his\r\namazing powers of application, could not have been fulfilled. He lived,\r\nhowever, to see the end of his life-work in sight, and more than that of\r\nany other man his name will be associated with the long and efficient\r\nworking of the great engine of research. The volumes produced by him have\r\ncharacteristic excellences which cannot be exactly matched, though they\r\nmay be rivalled by merits of another kind.\r\n\r\nThe work is now carried on by three editors, working independently on\r\ndifferent sections of the alphabet. Dr. Henry Bradley, whose period\r\nof work on the Dictionary now rivals Murray’s in point of time, is by\r\ncommon consent the greatest of living English philologists. He has\r\nbeen an editor since 1888. Professor W. A. Craigie, who has been an\r\neditor since 1901, and Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon\r\nsince 1916, brings to the work of the Dictionary a rare combination of\r\nqualifications. He is especially eminent as a Scandinavian scholar.\r\nMr. C. T. Onions, appointed an editor in 1913, has been on the staff\r\nsince 1895. He is also known to scholars as the author of the _Oxford\r\nShakespeare Glossary_ and for his editorial part in _Shakespeare’s\r\nEngland_.\r\n\r\nThe London Goldsmiths’ Company contributed £5,000 towards the cost of\r\nthe sixth volume of the Dictionary, the title-page of which records\r\ntheir generous support. Apart from this the whole of the editorial and\r\nmanufacturing cost of the work has been borne by the Delegates of the\r\nPress, who have defrayed from their general revenues a heavy annual\r\noutlay for many years. This has necessarily risen since the war, and it\r\nis fortunate that so large a part of the work had been completed under\r\nconditions less onerous than now obtain.\r\n\r\nThe price of the Dictionary has been kept very low, the sections being\r\npublished at the rate of 2_s._ 6_d._ for sixty-four pages or less than\r\na halfpenny per page containing on an average over 300 lines of type\r\nand nearly 3,000 words. Few books have ever been sold at so low a rate.\r\nThe prices of volumes and half volumes stoutly bound in leather have\r\nnecessarily been advanced in recent years to meet the enhanced cost\r\nof manufacturing; but the price of the Dictionary is still no more\r\nthan nominal, if regard is paid to the outlay precedent to the actual\r\nmanufacture of the books. Sections in paper wrappers, issued after 1920,\r\nwill be priced at the rate of 5_s._ for sixty-four pages; but it is not\r\nproposed to raise the price of the bulk of the work in this form.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ in 1897 described the Dictionary as ‘the greatest\r\neffort which any University, it may be any printing press, has taken in\r\nhand since the invention of printing.... It will be not the least of the\r\nglories of the University of Oxford to have completed this gigantic task’.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon in his _Letter to the University_ of 1909 wrote: ‘In the\r\nstaff of the English Dictionary alone the Press contributes to the\r\nUniversity what is probably the largest single engine of Research working\r\nanywhere at the present time.’\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Dictionary of National Biography_\r\n\r\nThis, the largest of all national collections of biography, owes its\r\nexistence to the enterprise and munificence of the late GEORGE SMITH,\r\nwho founded it in 1882. The work was produced by the co-operation of\r\na large number of scholars acting under the direction of the late Sir\r\nLESLIE STEPHEN, with whom was afterwards associated Mr. SIDNEY LEE; and\r\nthe latter half of the work was produced under Sir SIDNEY LEE’s sole\r\neditorship.\r\n\r\nIt was produced in sixty-three quarterly volumes, 1885-1900, the\r\narrangement being alphabetical; and the lives of those who died too\r\nlate to be admitted in their alphabetical place were included by the\r\nissue of three supplementary volumes, which brought the work down to\r\nthe death of Queen Victoria and just past the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The sixty-six volumes were later reissued, with corrections, on\r\nthinner paper, three volumes being converted into one; and this edition\r\nin twenty-two volumes constitutes the main dictionary from the earliest\r\ntimes to the close of the Victorian era, in the form now on sale. It\r\ncontains, in rather more than 30,000 pages, some 30,000 lives, each\r\nequipped with a select bibliography. The roll of contributors includes\r\nmany famous names; conspicuous among the articles are those of Sir Leslie\r\nStephen himself, which are models of form and substance, and those of the\r\npresent Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, Dr. C. H. Firth,\r\nwhose Life of Cromwell is an acknowledged classic.\r\n\r\nContinuing the work of the founder, Mrs. George Smith undertook a\r\nSupplement covering the years 1901-1911, which was produced by Sir Sidney\r\nLee in 1912-13. This, as the first of a series of twentieth-century\r\nvolumes, inaugurated what may be regarded as a second and distinct work.\r\n\r\nFurther, in 1903 was published in one volume an _Index and Epitome_ to\r\nthe Dictionary, giving within 1,500 pages 30,000 succinct biographies.\r\nThe value of this compendium, to the very large non-professional public\r\nto whom the main work in twenty-two bulky volumes is not readily\r\naccessible, need not be emphasized. It has been thought proper, however,\r\nto lay stress upon its usefulness as an independent work of reference,\r\nwhich may fairly be expected to take its place, upon thousands of\r\nshelves, along with other compendious dictionaries and encyclopaedias;\r\nthe Index and Epitome, therefore, along with the Index and Epitome to the\r\nSupplement of 1901-11, bound with it, is now issued under the short title\r\nof _Concise Dictionary of National Biography_.\r\n\r\nThe Dictionary of National Biography, with the responsibility for\r\nits maintenance, was offered to the University of Oxford in 1917 and\r\ngratefully accepted. Work is now in progress on a further decennial\r\nsupplement covering the years 1912-21. This supplement will be edited by\r\nMr. H. W. Carless Davis of Balliol and Mr. J. R. H. Weaver of Trinity.\r\nThe Supplement of 1901-11, the _Concise Dictionary_, and many volumes of\r\nthe main work, have recently been reprinted from plates; and the sale of\r\nthe work shows an improvement when compared with the years preceding the\r\nwar. Whether it will in the future be found practicable to attempt the\r\nsystematic revision of the main work must still remain in doubt. The\r\nmanufacturing expense of a new edition would be very heavy, and could be\r\njustified only by searching investigations, leading to a very substantial\r\ngain in accuracy, which must occupy years and involve a further heavy\r\nexpenditure. The total outlay required has been estimated at £100,000,\r\nand this perhaps could not be defrayed without the munificence of a\r\nsecond founder. It may, however, be hoped that such a work will not\r\nat last languish for lack of funds. Meanwhile, under the direction of\r\nMr. H. W. CARLESS DAVIS, the Delegates’ adviser upon the Dictionary,\r\npreliminary work is being steadily carried on. Subject-indexes have been\r\nprepared; a bibliography is in hand of the biographical literature which\r\nhas accumulated since the publication of the Dictionary; and various\r\nspecial investigations are being made into periods for which the work is\r\nespecially in need of revision. When it is remembered that a whole army\r\nof scholars was continually at work upon the material of the _New English\r\nDictionary_ for more than a quarter of a century before the first page\r\nwas sent to press, it will be seen that the material of the _Dictionary\r\nof National Biography_ may have to be newly surveyed with something of\r\nthe same elaboration, if that Dictionary is ever to be rebuilt from its\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _The Oxford Medical Publications_\r\n\r\nIn the year 1907 a Joint Committee was formed between the Oxford\r\nUniversity Press and Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton, under the Directorship\r\nof Mr. Humphrey Sumner Milford and Sir Ernest Hodder Williams, which had\r\nfor its object the production of Medical, Surgical, and Scientific books,\r\nunder the general title of the ‘Oxford Medical Publications’.\r\n\r\nThe Committee were peculiarly fortunate in having the invaluable advice\r\nand assistance, in the choice of Authors and Subjects, of the late Sir\r\nWilliam Osler, Regius Professor of Medicine in the University of Oxford,\r\nand a Delegate of the Press.\r\n\r\nThe key-note of the Oxford Medical Publications has always been the\r\npractical character of the treatment. The popular Medical Manuals,\r\nMonographs, and the ‘General Practitioner Series’ have now a world-wide\r\nreputation, and include a large number of standard works, such as\r\n_Diseases of the Heart_, and _Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment in\r\nHeart Affections_ by Sir James Mackenzie, _A System of Operative Surgery_\r\nby F. F. Burghard, C.B., _Common Disorders and Diseases of Childhood_\r\nby G. F. Still, _Practical Obstetrics_ by Professor E. Hastings Tweedy,\r\n_Guide to Gynaecology in General Practice_ by Comyns Berkeley and Victor\r\nBonney, _The Practitioner’s Encyclopaedia of Medical Treatment_, _The\r\nPractitioner’s Encyclopaedia of Medicine and Surgery_.\r\n\r\nBy the acquisition in 1908 of Mr. Young J. Pentland’s business, leading\r\nText-books by the most eminent Scottish authors were incorporated,\r\nincluding such well-known books as Cunningham’s _Text-book of Anatomy_\r\nand _Manual of Practical Anatomy_, Muir and Ritchie’s _Manual of\r\nBacteriology_, Thomson and Miles’s _Manual of Surgery_, Waring’s _Manual\r\nof Operative Surgery_, Thomson’s _Outlines of Zoology_.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford Medical Publications were awarded the Grand Prix at the\r\nseventeenth International Congress of Medicine held in London in 1913.\r\nThis award was bestowed for the general excellence of the Students’ books\r\nproduced in the Series, and for the production of new and original work\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the Committee sustained a great loss in the death of their\r\nEditor, James Keogh Murphy. A further heavy loss was sustained at the end\r\nof 1919 by the death of Sir William Osler, whose advice and assistance\r\nhad always been of inestimable value. After the death of Mr. Murphy,\r\nthe Editorship was temporarily undertaken by Lieut.-Colonel Sir D’Arcy\r\nPower, who was responsible for several important additions to the Series,\r\nincluding the well-known _Oxford War Primers of Medicine and Surgery_.\r\nTowards the close of hostilities Captain Robert McNair Wilson, M.B.,\r\nCh.B., late Assistant to Sir James Mackenzie under the Medical Research\r\nCommittee, became Editor, and under his direction further important\r\nadditions have been made, including _Menders of the Maimed_ by Professor\r\nArthur Keith, _Studies in Neurology_ by Henry Head, _Operative Treatment\r\nof Chronic Intestinal Stasis_ by Sir W. Arbuthnot Lane, _Diagnosis and\r\nTreatment of Venereal Diseases in General Practice_ by Brevet-Colonel\r\nL. W. Harrison, D.S.O., _Plastic Surgery of the Face_ by Major H.\r\nD. Gillies, C.B.E., R.A.M.C., _War Neuroses and Shell Shock_ by Sir\r\nFrederick Mott, K.B.E., _Trench Fever_ by Lieut.-Colonel W. Byam, O.B.E.,\r\n_Clinical Ophthalmology for the General Practitioner_ by A. Maitland\r\nRamsay, and _Tropical Ophthalmology_ by Lieut.-Colonel R. H. Elliot,\r\nI.M.S. The present Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, Sir Archibald\r\nGarrod, is a Delegate of the Press and an Oxford author.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford Catalogue now devotes many pages to the medical list, and the\r\nAmerican Branch, by the publication of the encyclopaedic ‘loose-leaf’\r\n_Oxford Surgery_, has produced an important and valuable adaptation of a\r\nBritish original. In the _Quarterly Journal of Medicine_ the University\r\npossesses one of the most valuable scientific journals in the world;\r\nand in the other medical publications it administers what is at once a\r\nvaluable property and a powerful instrument of education. Oxford medical\r\nbooks are known wherever English is spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. _Oxford Books for Boys and Girls_\r\n\r\nThe more recent activities of the Press include a notable enterprise,\r\nstarted by Mr. Henry Frowde jointly with Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton,\r\nbut now carried on by Mr. Milford alone. This was the foundation in 1907\r\nof a new department for the issue of educational works for elementary\r\nschools, and of ‘gift-books’, useful and recreative literature, for\r\nyoung people of all ages. The Oxford Reading Books, which headed the\r\nlist, set a new literary standard for books of the class; and the series\r\nestablished itself not only in this country but in parts of the Empire so\r\nremote and so diverse as Australia and Burma. It was followed by further\r\nseries of reading books, and of books on history, geography, arithmetic,\r\nnature study, and other subjects of the elementary curriculum. The part\r\ntaken by the Press in the educational system of the English-speaking\r\nworld may now be said to comprehend the whole scholastic field from the\r\ninfant school upwards.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the school publications, the J. Department, as it is\r\nknown for convenience, has issued from Falcon Square a great variety\r\nof books for the leisure hours of boys and girls. These include\r\nfinely illustrated editions of classics, such as _Robinson Crusoe_,\r\nGrimm’s _Tales_, Kingsley’s _Water Babies_, _Alice in Wonderland_;\r\nbooks on nature, science, industry, imperial history; miscellanies\r\nboth instructive and entertaining; stories for boys, girls, and young\r\nchildren; and for the very youngest, picture books of all kinds.\r\n\r\nAll these publications are edited with care, and both on the literary and\r\non the artistic side a high level of excellence is aimed at. Some two\r\nmillion copies of the books are distributed during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Part of the first lines of the Great Charter of the\r\n  University granted by Charles I on March 3, 1635/6,\r\n  in which the printing privileges, first granted on\r\n  Nov. 12, 1632, were finally confirmed and settled.
