I. The National Institute, at present divided into three\r\nclasses, shall henceforth consist of four; namely:\r\n\r\n  _First Class_--Class of physical and mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Second Class_--Class of the French language and literature.\r\n\r\n  _Third Class_--Class of history and ancient literature.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth Class_--Class of fine arts.\r\n\r\nThe present members of the Institute and associated foreigners shall\r\nbe divided into these four classes. A commission of five members of\r\nthe Institute, appointed by the First Consul, shall present to him\r\nthe plan of this division, which shall be submitted to the\r\napprobation of the government.\r\n\r\nII. The first class, shall be formed of the ten sections, which at\r\npresent compose the first class of the Institute, of a new section of\r\ngeography and navigation, and of eight foreign associates.\r\n\r\nThese sections shall be composed and distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n  MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geometry                             six members.\r\n  Mechanics                            six   ditto.\r\n  Astronomy                            six   ditto.\r\n  Geography and Navigation             three ditto.\r\n  General Physics                      six   ditto.\r\n\r\n  PHYSICAL SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n  Chemistry                            six   ditto.\r\n  Mineralogy                           six   ditto.\r\n  Botany                               six   ditto.\r\n  Rural Economy and the Veterinary Art six   ditto.\r\n  Anatomy and Zoology                  six   ditto.\r\n  Medicine and Surgery                 six   ditto.\r\n\r\nThe first class shall name, with the approbation of the Chief Consul,\r\ntwo perpetual secretaries; the one for the mathematical sciences; the\r\nother, for the physical. The perpetual secretaries shall be members\r\nof the class, but shall make no part of any section.\r\n\r\nThe first class may elect six of its members from among the other\r\nclasses of the Institute. It may name a hundred correspondents, taken\r\nfrom among the learned men of the nation, and those of foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIII.

It shall\r\nparticularly endeavour to enrich French literature with the works of\r\nGreek, Latin, and Oriental authors, which have not yet been\r\ntranslated.\r\n\r\nIt shall employ itself in the continuation of diplomatic collections.\r\n\r\nWith the approbation of the First Consul, it shall name from its own\r\nmembers a perpetual secretary, who shall make one of the forty\r\nmembers of whom the class is composed.\r\n\r\nIt may elect nine of its members from among those of the classes of\r\nthe Institute.\r\n\r\nIt may name sixty national or foreign correspondents.\r\n\r\nV.

They shall drop that of correspondents, when they take up\r\ntheir constant residence in Paris.\r\n\r\nVIII.

Every year, each class shall distribute prizes, the number and\r\nvalue of which shall be regulated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe first class, a prize of 3000 francs.\r\n\r\nThe second and third classes, each a prize of 1500 francs.\r\n\r\nAnd the fourth class, great prizes of painting, sculpture,\r\narchitecture, and musical composition.

The Minister of the Interior is charged with the execution of\r\nthe present decree, which shall be inserted in the Bulletin of the\r\nLaws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Referred to in Letter XLV, Vol. II of this work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nOn ushering into the world a literary production, custom has\r\nestablished that its parent should give some account of his\r\noffspring. Indeed, this becomes the more necessary at the present\r\nmoment, as the short-lived peace, which gave birth to the following\r\nsheets, had already ceased before they were entirely printed; and the\r\nwar in which England and France are now engaged, is of a nature\r\ncalculated not only to rouse all the energy and ancient spirit of my\r\ncountrymen, but also to revive their prejudices, and inflame their\r\npassions, in a degree proportionate to the enemy's boastful and\r\nprovoking menace.\r\n\r\nI therefore premise that those who may be tempted to take up this\r\npublication, merely with a view of seeking aliment for their enmity,\r\nwill, in more respects than one, probably find themselves\r\ndisappointed. The two nations were not rivals in arms, but in the\r\narts and sciences, at the time these letters were written, and\r\ncommitted to the press; consequently, they have no relation whatever\r\nto the present contest. Nevertheless, as they refer to subjects which\r\nmanifest the indefatigable activity of the French in the\r\naccomplishment of any grand object, such parts may, perhaps, furnish\r\nhints that may not be altogether unimportant at this momentous\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThe plan most generally adhered to throughout this work, being\r\ndetailed in LETTER V, a repetition of it here would be superfluous;\r\nand the principal matters to which the work itself relates, are\r\nspecified in the title. I now come to the point.\r\n\r\nA long residence in France, and particularly in the capital, having\r\nafforded me an opportunity of becoming tolerably well acquainted with\r\nits state before the revolution, my curiosity was strongly excited to\r\nascertain the changes which that political phenomenon might have\r\neffected. I accordingly availed myself of the earliest dawn of peace\r\nto cross the water, and visit Paris. Since I had left that city in\r\n1789-90, a powerful monarchy, established on a possession of fourteen\r\ncenturies, and on that sort of national prosperity which seemed to\r\nchallenge the approbation of future ages, had been destroyed by the\r\nforce of opinion which, like, a subterraneous fire, consumed its very\r\nfoundations, and plunged the nation into a sea of troubles, in which\r\nit was, for several years, tossed about, amid the wreck of its\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nThis is a phenomenon of which antiquity affords no parallel; and it\r\nhas produced a rapid succession of events so extraordinary as almost\r\nto exceed belief.\r\n\r\nIt is not the crimes to which it has given birth that will be thought\r\nimprobable: the history of revolutions, as well ancient as modern,\r\nfurnishes but too many examples of them; and few have been committed,\r\nthe traces of which are not to be found in the countries where the\r\nimagination of the multitude has been exalted by strong and new\r\nideas, respecting Liberty and Equality. But what posterity will find\r\ndifficult to believe, is the agitation of men's minds, and the\r\neffervescence of the passions, carried to such a pitch, as to stamp\r\nthe French revolution with a character bordering on the marvellous\r\n--Yes; posterity will have reason to be astonished at the facility\r\nwith which the human mind can be modified and made to pass from one\r\nextreme to another; at the suddenness, in short, with which the ideas\r\nand manners of the French were changed; so powerful, on the one hand,\r\nis the ascendency of certain imaginations; and, on the other, so\r\ngreat is the weakness of the vulgar!\r\n\r\nIt is in the recollection of most persons, that the agitation of the\r\npublic mind in France was such, for a while, that, after having\r\noverthrown the monarchy and its supports; rendered private property\r\ninsecure; and destroyed individual freedom; it threatened to invade\r\nforeign countries, at the same time pushing before it Liberty, that\r\nfirst blessing of man, when it is founded on laws, and the most\r\ndangerous of chimeras, when it is without rule or restraint.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the causes which excited this general commotion,\r\nexisted before the assembly of the States-General in 1789. It is\r\ntherefore important to take a mental view of the moral and political\r\nsituation of France at that period, and to follow, in imagination at\r\nleast, the chain of ideas, passions, and errors, which, having\r\ndissolved the ties of society, and worn out the springs of\r\ngovernment, led the nation by gigantic strides into the most complete\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nWithout enumerating the different authorities which successively\r\nruled in France after the fall of the throne, it appears no less\r\nessential to remind the reader that, in this general disorganization,\r\nthe inhabitants themselves, though breathing the same air, scarcely\r\nknew that they belonged to the same nation. The altars overthrown;\r\nall the ancient institutions annihilated; new festivals and\r\nceremonies introduced; factious demagogues honoured with an\r\napotheosis; their busts exposed to public veneration; men and cities\r\nchanging names; a portion of the people infected with atheism, and\r\ndisguised in the livery of guilt and folly; all this, and more,\r\nexercised the reflection of the well-disposed in a manner the most\r\npainful. In a word, though France was peopled with the same\r\nindividuals, it seemed inhabited by a new nation, entirely different\r\nfrom the old one in its government, its creed, its principles, its\r\nmanners, and even its customs.\r\n\r\nWar itself assumed a new face. Every thing relating to it became\r\nextraordinary: the number of the combatants, the manner of recruiting\r\nthe armies, and the means of providing supplies for them; the\r\nmanufacture of powder, cannon, and muskets; the ardour, impetuosity,\r\nand forced marches of the troops; their extortions, their successes,\r\nand their reverses; the choice of the generals, and the superior\r\ntalents of some of them, together with the springs, by which these\r\nenormous bodies of armed men were moved and directed, were equally\r\nnew and astonishing.\r\n\r\nHistory tells us that in poor countries, where nothing inflames\r\ncupidity and ambition, the love alone of the public good causes\r\nchanges to be tried in the government; and that those changes derange\r\nnot the ordinary course of society; whereas, among rich nations,\r\ncorrupted by luxury, revolutions are always effected through secret\r\nmotives of jealousy and interest; because there are great places to\r\nbe usurped, and great fortunes to be invaded. In France, the\r\nrevolution covered the country with ruins, tears, and blood, because\r\nmeans were not to be found to moderate in the people that\r\n_revolutionary spirit_ which parches, in the bud, the promised fruits\r\nof liberty, when its violence is not repressed.\r\n\r\nFew persons were capable of keeping pace with the rapid progress of\r\nthe revolution. Those who remained behind were considered as guilty\r\nof desertion. The authors of the first constitution were accused of\r\nbeing _royalists_; the old partisans of republicanism were punished\r\nas _moderates_; the land-owners, as _aristocrates_; the monied men,\r\nas _corrupters_; the bankers and financiers, as _blood-suckers_; the\r\nshop-keepers, as _promoters of famine_; and the newsmongers, as\r\n_alarmists_. The factious themselves, in short, were alternately\r\nproscribed, as soon as they ceased to belong to the ruling faction.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, society became a prey to the most baneful\r\npassions. Mistrust entered every heart; friendship had no attraction;\r\nrelationship, no tie; and men's minds, hardened by the habit of\r\nmisfortune, or overwhelmed by fear, no longer opened to pity.\r\n\r\nTerror compressed every imagination; and the revolutionary\r\ngovernment, exercising it to its fullest extent, struck off a\r\nprodigious number of heads, filled the prisons with victims, and\r\ncontinued to corrupt the morals of the nation by staining it with\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nBut all things have an end. The tyrants fell; the dungeons were\r\nthrown open; numberless victims emerged from them; and France seemed\r\nto recover new life; but still bewildered by the _revolutionary\r\nspirit_, wasted by the concealed poison of anarchy, exhausted by her\r\ninnumerable sacrifices, and almost paralyzed by her own convulsions,\r\nshe made but impotent efforts for the enjoyment of liberty and\r\njustice. Taxes became more burdensome; commerce was annihilated;\r\nindustry, without aliment; paper-money, without value; and specie,\r\nwithout circulation. However, while the French nation was degraded at\r\nhome by this series of evils, it was respected abroad through the\r\nrare merit of some of its generals, the splendour of its victories,\r\nand the bravery of its soldiers.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, there was formed in the public mind that\r\nmoral resistance which destroys not governments by violence, but\r\nundermines them. The intestine commotions were increasing; the\r\nconquests of the French were invaded; their enemies were already on\r\ntheir frontiers; and the division which had broken out between the\r\nDirectory and the Legislative Body, again threatened France with a\r\ntotal dissolution, when a man of extraordinary character and talents\r\nhad the boldness to seize the reins of authority, and stop the\r\nfurther progress of the revolution.[1] Taking at the full the tide\r\nwhich leads on to fortune, he at once changed the face of affairs,\r\nnot only within the limits of the Republic, but throughout Europe.\r\nYet, after all their triumphs, the French have the mortification to\r\nhave failed in gaining that for which they first took up arms, and\r\nfor which they have maintained so long and so obstinate a struggle.\r\n\r\nWhen a strong mound has been broken down, the waters whose amassed\r\nvolume it opposed, rush forward, and, in their impetuous course,\r\nspread afar terror and devastation. On visiting the scene where this\r\nhas occurred, we naturally cast our eyes in every direction, to\r\ndiscover the mischief which they have occasioned by their irruption;\r\nso, then, on reaching the grand theatre of the French revolution, did\r\nI look about for the traces of the havock it had left behind; but,\r\nlike a river which had regained its level, and flowed again in its\r\nnatural bed, this political torrent had subsided, and its ravages\r\nwere repaired in a manner the most surprising.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the particular request of an estimable friend, I have\r\nendeavoured to draw the contrast which, in 1789-90 and 1801-2, Paris\r\npresented to the eye of an impartial observer. In this arduous\r\nattempt I have not the vanity to flatter myself that I have been\r\nsuccessful, though I have not hesitated to lay under contribution\r\nevery authority likely to promote my object. The state of the French\r\ncapital, before the revolution, I have delineated from the notes I\r\nhad myself collected on the spot, and for which purpose I was, at\r\nthat time, under the necessity of consulting almost as many books as\r\nDon Quixote read on knight-errantry; but the authors from whom I have\r\nchiefly borrowed, are St. FOIX, MERCIER, DULAURE, PUJOULX, and BIOT.\r\n\r\nMy invariable aim has been to relate, _sine ira nec studio_, such\r\nfacts and circumstances as have come to my knowledge, and to render\r\nto every one that justice which I should claim for myself. After a\r\nrevolution which has trenched on so many opposite interests, the\r\nreader cannot be surprised, if information, derived from such a\r\nvariety of sources, should sometimes seem to bear the character of\r\nparty-spirit. Should this appear _on the face of the record_, I can\r\nonly say that I have avoided entering into politics, in order that no\r\nbias of that sort might lead me to discolour or distort the truths I\r\nhave had occasion to state; and I have totally rejected those\r\ncommunications which, from their tone of bitterness, personality, and\r\nvirulence, might be incompatible with the general tenour of an\r\nimpartial production.\r\n\r\nTill the joint approbation of some competent judges, who visited the\r\nFrench capital after having perused, in manuscript, several of these\r\nletters, had stamped on them a comparative degree of value, no one\r\ncould think more lightly of them than the author. Urged repeatedly to\r\nproduce them to the public, I have yielded with reluctance, and in\r\nthe fullest confidence that, notwithstanding the recent change of\r\ncircumstances, a liberal construction will be put on my sentiments\r\nand motives. I have taken care that my account of the national\r\nestablishments in France should be perfectly correct; and, in fact, I\r\nhave been favoured with the principal information it contains by\r\ntheir respective directors. In regard to the other topics on which I\r\nhave touched, I have not failed to consult the best authorities, even\r\nin matters, which, however trifling in themselves, acquire a relative\r\nimportance, from being illustrative of some of the many-coloured\r\neffects of a revolution, which has humbled the pride of many,\r\nderanged the calculations of all, disappointed the hopes of not a\r\nfew, and deceived those even by whom it had been engendered and\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nYet, whatever pains I have taken to be strictly impartial, it cannot\r\nbe denied that, in publishing a work of this description at a time\r\nwhen the self-love of most men is mortified, and their resentment\r\nawakened, I run no small risk of displeasing all parties, because I\r\nattach myself to none, but find them all more or less deserving of\r\ncensure. Without descending either to flattery or calumny, I speak\r\nboth well and ill of the French, because I copy nature, and neither\r\ndraw an imaginary portrait, nor write a systematic narrative. If I\r\nhave occasionally given vent to my indignation in glancing at the\r\nexcesses of the revolution, I have not withheld my tribute of\r\napplause from those institutions, which, being calculated to benefit\r\nmankind by the gratuitous diffusion of knowledge, would reflect\r\nhonour on any nation. In other respects, I have not been unmindful of\r\nthat excellent precept of TACITUS, in which he observes that \"The\r\nprincipal duty of the historian is to rescue from oblivion virtuous\r\nactions, and to make bad men dread infamy and posterity for what they\r\nhave said and done.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn stating facts, it is frequently necessary to support them by a\r\nrelation of particular circumstances, which may corroborate them in\r\nan unquestionable manner. Feeling this truth, I have some times\r\nintroduced myself on my canvass, merely to shew that I am not an\r\nideal traveller. I mean one of those pleasant fellows who travel post\r\nin their elbow-chair, sail round the world on a map suspended to one\r\nside of their room, cross the seas with a pocket-compass lying on\r\ntheir table, experience a shipwreck by their fireside, make their\r\nescape when it scorches their shins, and land on a desert island in\r\ntheir _robe de chambre_ and slippers.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, here and there mentioned names, time, and place,\r\nto prove that, _bonâ fide_, I went to Paris immediately after the\r\nratification of the preliminary treaty. To banish uniformity in my\r\ndescription of that metropolis, I have, as much as possible, varied\r\nmy subjects. Fashions, sciences, absurdities, anecdotes, education,\r\nfêtes, useful arts, places of amusement, music, learned and\r\nscientific institutions, inventions, public buildings, industry,\r\nagriculture, &c. &c. &c. being all jumbled together in my brain, I\r\nhave thence drawn them, like tickets from a lottery; and it will not,\r\nI trust, be deemed presumptuous in me to indulge a hope that, in\r\nproportion to the blanks, there will be found no inadequate number of\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the immense advantages which France is likely to\r\nderive from her Schools for Public Services, and other establishments\r\nof striking utility, such as the _Dépôt de la Guerre_ and the _Dépôt\r\nde la Marine_, in order that the British government may be prompted\r\nto form institutions, which, if not exactly similar, may at least\r\nanswer the same purpose. Instead of copying the French in objects of\r\nfickleness and frivolity, why not borrow from them what is really\r\ndeserving of imitation?\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to observe, by way of stimulating the ambition of\r\nBritish genius, that, in France, the arts and sciences are now making\r\na rapid and simultaneous progress; first, because the revolution has\r\nmade them popular in that country; and, secondly, because they are\r\ndaily connected by new ties, which, in a great measure, render them\r\ninseparable. Facts are there recurred to, less with a view to draw\r\nfrom them immediate applications than to develop the truths resulting\r\nfrom them. The first step is from these facts to their most simple\r\nconsequences, which are little more than bare assertions. From these\r\nthe _savans_ proceed to others more minute, till, at length, by\r\nimperceptible degrees, they arrive at the most abstracted\r\ngeneralities. With them, method is an induction incessantly verified\r\nby experiment. Whence, it gives to human intelligence, not wings\r\nwhich lead it astray, but reins which guide it. United by this common\r\nphilosophy, the sciences and arts in France advance together; and the\r\nprogress made by one of them serves to promote that of the rest.\r\nThere, the men who profess them, considering that their knowledge\r\nbelongs not to themselves alone, not to their country only, but to\r\nall mankind, are continually striving to increase the mass of public\r\nknowledge. This they regard as a real duty, which they are proud to\r\ndischarge; thus treading in the steps of the most memorable men of\r\npast ages.\r\n\r\nThen, while the more unlearned and unskilled among us are emulating\r\nthe patriotic enthusiasm of the French in volunteering, as they did,\r\nto resist invasion, let our men of science and genius exert\r\nthemselves not to be surpassed by the industrious _savans_ and\r\nartists of that nation; but let them act on the principle inculcated\r\nby the following sublime idea of our illustrious countryman, the\r\nfounder of modern philosophy. \"It may not be amiss,\" says BACON, \"to\r\npoint out three different kinds, and, as it were, degrees of\r\nambition. The first, that of those who desire to enhance, in their\r\nown country, the power they arrogate to themselves: this kind of\r\nambition is both vulgar and degenerate. The second, that of those who\r\nendeavour to extend the power and domination of their country, over\r\nthe whole of the human race: in this kind there is certainly a\r\ngreater dignity, though; at the same time, no less a share of\r\ncupidity. But should any one strive to restore and extend the power\r\nand domination of mankind over the universality of things,\r\nunquestionably such an ambition, (if it can be so denominated) would\r\nbe more reasonable and dignified than the others. Now, the empire of\r\nman, over things, has its foundation exclusively in the arts and\r\nsciences; for it is only by an obedience to her laws, that Nature can\r\nbe commanded.\"[3]\r\n\r\nLONDON, June 10, 1803.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of two things, we are left to believe one. BONAPARTE\r\neither was or was not invited to put himself at the head of the\r\ngovernment of France. It is not probable that the Directory should\r\nsend for him from Egypt, in order to say to him: \"we are fools and\r\ndrivelers, unfit to conduct the affairs of the nation; so turn us out\r\nof office, and seat yourself in our place.\" Nevertheless, they might\r\nhave hoped to preserve their tottering authority through his support.\r\nBe this as it may, there it something so singular in the good fortune\r\nwhich has attended BONAPARTE from the period of his quitting\r\nAlexandria, that, were it not known for truth, it might well be taken\r\nfor fiction. Sailing from the road of Aboukir on the 24th of August,\r\n1799, he eludes the vigilance of the English cruisers, and lands at\r\nFrejus in France on the 14th of October following, the forty-seventh\r\nday after his departure from Egypt. On his arrival in Paris, so far\r\nfrom giving an account of his conduct to the Directory, he turns his\r\nback on them; accepts the proposition made to him, from another\r\nquarter, to effect a change in the government; on the 9th of\r\nNovember, carries it into execution; and, profiting by the _popularis\r\naura_, fixes himself at the head of the State, at the same time\r\nkicking down the ladder by which he climbed to power. To achieve all\r\nthis with such promptitude and energy, most assuredly required a mind\r\nof no common texture; nor can any one deny that ambition would have\r\ndone but little towards its accomplishment, had it not been seconded\r\nby extraordinary firmness.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _\"Præcipuum munus annalium reor, ne virtutes sileantur,\r\nutque praxis dictis factisque ex posteritate et infamiâ metus sit.\"_]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"_Præterca non abs refuerit, tria hominum ambitionis\r\ngenera et quasi gradus distinguere. Primum eorum qui propriam\r\npotentiam in patria sua amplificare cupiunt; quod genus vulgare est\r\net degener. Secundum eorum, qui patriæ potentiam et imperium inter\r\nhumanum genus amplificare nituntur; illud plus certe habet\r\ndignitatis, cupiditatis haud minus. Quod si quis humani generis\r\nipsius potentiam et imperium in rerum univertitatem instaurare et\r\namplificare conetur ea procul dubio ambitio (si modo ita cocanda sit)\r\nreliquls et sanior est et augustior.

London, printed 1803.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF PARIS, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\n_Calais, October 16, 1801._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nHad you not made it a particular request that I would give you the\r\nearliest account of my debarkation in France, I should, probably, not\r\nhave been tempted to write to you till I reached Paris. I well know\r\nthe great stress which you lay on first impressions; but what little\r\nI have now to communicate will poorly gratify your expectation.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of this letter, you will perceive that, since we parted\r\nyesterday, I have not been dilatory in my motions. No sooner had a\r\nmessenger from the Alien-Office brought me the promised passport, or\r\nrather his Majesty's licence, permitting me to embark for France,\r\nthan I proceeded on my journey.\r\n\r\nIn nine hours I reached Dover, and, being authorized by a proper\r\nintroduction, immediately applied to Mr. Mantell, the agent for\r\nprisoners of war, cartels, &c. for a passage across the water. An\r\nEnglish flag of truce was then in the harbour, waiting only for\r\ngovernment dispatches; and I found that, if I could get my baggage\r\nvisited in time, I might avail myself of the opportunity of crossing\r\nthe sea in this vessel. On having recourse to the collector of the\r\ncustoms, I succeeded in my wish: the dispatches arriving shortly\r\nafter, mid my baggage being already shipped, I stepped off the quay\r\ninto the Nancy, on board of which I was the only passenger. A\r\npropitious breeze sprang up at the moment, and, in less than three\r\nhours, wafted me to Calais pier.\r\n\r\nBy the person who carried the dispatches to Citizen Mengaud, the\r\ncommissary for this department (_Pas de Calais_), I sent a card with\r\nmy name and rank, requesting permission to land and deliver to him a\r\nletter from M. Otto. This step was indispensable: the vessel which\r\nbrought me was, I find, the first British flag of truce that has been\r\nsuffered to enter the harbour, with the exception of the Prince of\r\nWales packet, now waiting here for the return of a king's messenger\r\nfrom Paris; and her captain even has not yet been permitted to go on\r\nshore. It therefore appears that I shall be the first Englishman, not\r\nin an official character, who has set foot on French ground since the\r\nratification of the preliminary treaty.\r\n\r\nThe pier was presently crowded with people gazing at our vessel, as\r\nif she presented a spectacle perfectly novel: but, except the\r\ntri-coloured cockade in the hats of the military, I could not observe\r\nthe smallest difference in their general appearance. Instead of crops\r\nand round wigs, which I expected to see in universal vogue, here were\r\nfull as many powdered heads and long queues as before the revolution.\r\nFrenchmen, in general, will, I am persuaded, ever be Frenchmen in\r\ntheir dress, which, in my opinion, can never be _revolutionized_,\r\neither by precept or example. The _citoyens_, as far as I am yet able\r\nto judge, most certainly have not fattened by warfare more than JOHN\r\nBULL: their visages are as sallow and as thin as formerly, though\r\ntheir persons are not quite so meagre as they are pourtrayed by\r\nHogarth.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of peace, however, seemed to have produced an\r\nexhilarating effect on all ranks; satisfaction appeared on every\r\ncountenance. According to custom, a host of inkeepers' domestics\r\nboarded the vessel, each vaunting the superiority of his master's\r\naccommodations. My old landlord Ducrocq presenting himself to\r\ncongratulate me on my arrival, soon freed me from their\r\nimportunities, and I, of course, decided in favour of the _Lion\r\nd'Argent_.\r\n\r\nPart of the _Boulogne_ flotilla was lying in the harbour.\r\nIndependently of the decks of the gunboats being full of soldiers,\r\nwith very few sailors intermixed, playing at different games of\r\nchance, not a plank, not a log, or piece of timber, was there on the\r\nquay but was also covered with similar parties. This then accounts\r\nfor that rage for gambling, which has carried to such desperate\r\nlengths those among them whom the fate of war has lodged in our\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nMy attention was soon diverted from this scene, by a polite answer\r\nfrom the commissary, inviting me to his house. I instantly\r\ndisembarked to wait on him; my letter containing nothing more than an\r\nintroduction, accompanied by a request that I might be furnished with\r\na passport to enable me to proceed to Paris without delay, Citizen\r\nMengaud dispatched a proper person to attend me to the town-hall,\r\nwhere the passports are made out, and signed by the mayor; though\r\nthey are not delivered till they have also received the commissary's\r\nsignature. However, to lose no time, while one of the clerks was\r\ndrawing my picture, or, in other words, taking down a minute\r\ndescription of my person, I sent my keys to the custom-house, in\r\norder that my baggage might be examined.\r\n\r\nBy what conveyance I was to proceed to Paris was the next point to be\r\nsettled; and this has brought me to the _Lion d'Argent_.\r\n\r\nAmong other vehicles, Ducrocq has, in his _remise_, an\r\napparently-good _cabriolet de voyage_, belonging to one of his Paris\r\ncorrespondents; but, on account of the wretched state of the roads,\r\nhe begs me to allow him time to send for his coachmaker, to examine\r\nit scrupulously, that I may not be detained by the way, from any\r\naccident happening to the carriage.\r\n\r\nI was just on the point of concluding my letter, when a French naval\r\nofficer, who was on the pier when I landed, introduced himself to me,\r\nto know whether I would do him the favour to accommodate him with a\r\nplace in the cabriolet under examination. I liked my new friend's\r\nappearance and manner too well not to accede to his proposal.\r\n\r\nThe carriage is reported to be in good condition. I shall therefore\r\nsend my servant on before as a courier, instead of taking him with me\r\nas an inside passenger. As we shall travel night and day, and the\r\npost-horses will be in readiness at every stage, we may, I am told,\r\nexpect to reach Paris in about forty-two hours. Adieu; my next will\r\nbe from the _great_ city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 19, 1801._\r\n\r\nHere I am safe arrived; that is, without any broken bones; though my\r\narms, knees, and head are finely pummelled by the jolting of the\r\ncarriage. Well might Ducrocq say that the roads were bad! In several\r\nplaces, they are not passable without danger--Indeed, the government\r\nis so fully aware of this, that an inspector has been dispatched to\r\ndirect immediate repairs to be made against the arrival of the\r\nEnglish ambassador; and, in some _communes_, the people are at work\r\nby torch-light. With this exception, my journey was exceedingly\r\npleasant. At ten o'clock the first night, we reached _Montreuil_,\r\nwhere we supped; the next day we breakfasted at _Abbeville_, dined at\r\n_Amiens_, and supped that evening at _Clermont_.\r\n\r\nThe road between _Calais_ and _Paris_ is too well known to interest\r\nby description. Most of the abbeys and monasteries, which present\r\nthemselves to the eye of the traveller, have either been converted\r\ninto hospitals or manufactories. Few there are, I believe, who will\r\ndeny that this change is for the better. A receptacle for the relief\r\nof suffering indigence conveys a consolatory idea to the mind of the\r\nfriend of human nature; while the lover of industry cannot but\r\napprove of an establishment which, while it enriches a State, affords\r\nemploy to the needy and diligent. This, unquestionably, is no bad\r\nappropriation of these buildings, which, when inhabited by monks,\r\nwere, for the most part, no more than an asylum of sloth, hypocrisy,\r\npride, and ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine, which contributed not a little to display the\r\ncountry to greater advantage; but the improvements recently made in\r\nagriculture are too striking to escape the notice of the most\r\ninattentive observer. The open plains and rising grounds of\r\n_ci-devant Picardy_ which, from ten to fifteen years ago, I have\r\nfrequently seen, in this season, mostly lying fallow, and presenting\r\nthe aspect of one wide, neglected waste, are now all well cultivated,\r\nand chiefly laid down in corn; and the corn, in general, seems to\r\nhave been sown with more than common attention.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-traveller, who was a _lieutenant de vaisseau_, belonging to\r\n_Latouche Tréville's_ flotilla, proved a very agreeable companion,\r\nand extremely well-informed. This officer positively denied the\r\ncircumstance of any of their gun-boats being moored with chains\r\nduring our last attack. While he did ample justice to the bravery of\r\nour people, he censured the manner in which it had been exerted. The\r\ndivisions of boats arriving separately, he said, could not afford to\r\neach other necessary support, and were thus exposed to certain\r\ndiscomfiture. I made the best defence I possibly could; but truth\r\nbears down all before it.\r\n\r\nThe loss on the side of the French, my fellow-traveller declared, was\r\nno more than seven men killed and forty-five wounded. Such of the\r\nlatter as were in a condition to undergo the fatigue of the ceremony,\r\nwere carried in triumphal procession through the streets of\r\n_Boulogne_, where, after being harangued by the mayor, they were\r\nrewarded with civic crowns from the hands of their fair\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nEarly the second morning after our departure from _Calais_, we\r\nreached the town of _St. Denis_, which, at one time since the\r\nrevolution, changed its name for that of _Françiade_. I never pass\r\nthrough this place without calling to mind the persecution which poor\r\nAbélard suffered from Adam, the abbot, for having dared to say, that\r\nthe body of _St. Denis_, first bishop of Paris, in 240, which had\r\nbeen preserved in this abbey among the relics, was not that of the\r\nareopagite, who died in 95. The ridiculous stories, imposed on the\r\ncredulity of the zealous catholics, respecting this wonderful saint,\r\nhave been exhibited in their proper light by Voltaire, as you may see\r\nby consulting the _Questions sur l'Encyclopédie_, at the article\r\n_Denis_.\r\n\r\nIt is in every person's recollection that, in consequence of the\r\nNational Convention having decreed the abolition of royalty in\r\nFrance, it was proposed to annihilate every vestige of it throughout\r\nthe country. But, probably, you are not aware of the thorough sweep\r\nthat was made among the sepultures in this abbey of _St. Denis_.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the kings, queens, princes, princesses, and celebrated\r\npersonages, who had been interred here for nearly fifteen hundred\r\nyears, were taken up, and literally reduced to ashes. Not a wreck was\r\nleft behind to make a relic.\r\n\r\nThe remains of TURENNE alone were respected. All the other bodies,\r\ntogether with the entrails or hearts, enclosed in separate urns, were\r\nthrown into large pits, lined with a coat of quick lime: they were\r\nthen covered with the same substance; and the pits were afterwards\r\nfilled up with earth. Most of them, as may be supposed, were in a\r\nstate of complete putrescency; of some, the bones only remained,\r\nthough a few were in good preservation.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the consort of Charles I. Henrietta Maria of France,\r\ndaughter of Henry IV, who died in 1669, aged 60, and of their\r\ndaughter Henrietta Stuart, first wife of Monsieur, only brother to\r\nLewis XIV, who died in 1670, aged 26, both interred in the vault of\r\nthe Bourbons, were consumed in the general destruction.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this decree was begun at _St. Denis_ on Saturday the\r\n12th of October 1793, and completed on the 25th of the same month, in\r\npresence of the municipality and several other persons.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November following, all the treasure of _St. Denis_,\r\n(shrines, relics, &c.) was removed: the whole was put into large\r\nwooden chests, together with all the rich ornaments of the church,\r\nconsisting of chalices, pyxes, cups, copes, &c. The same day these\r\nvaluable articles were sent off, in great state, in waggons,\r\ndecorated for the purpose, to the National Convention.\r\n\r\nWe left _St. Denis_ after a hasty breakfast; and, on reaching Paris,\r\nI determined to drive to the residence of a man whom I had never\r\nseen; but from whom I had little doubt of a welcome reception. I\r\naccordingly alighted in the _Rue neuve St. Roch_, where I found\r\nB----a, who perfectly answered the character given me of him by\r\nM. S----i.\r\n\r\nYou already know that, through the interest of my friend, Captain\r\nO----y, I was so fortunate as to procure the exchange of B----a's\r\nonly son, a deserving youth, who had been taken prisoner at sea, and\r\nlanguished two years in confinement in Portchester-Castle.\r\n\r\nBefore I could introduce myself, one of young B----a's sisters\r\nproclaimed my name, as if by inspiration; and I was instantly greeted\r\nwith the cordial embraces of the whole family. This scene made me at\r\nonce forget the fatigues of my journey; and, though I had not been in\r\nbed for three successive nights, the agreeable sensations excited in\r\nmy mind, by the unaffected expression of gratitude, banished every\r\ninclination to sleep. If honest B----a and his family felt themselves\r\nobliged to me, I felt myself doubly and trebly obliged to Captain\r\nO----y; for, to his kind exertion, was I indebted for the secret\r\nenjoyment arising from the performance of a disinterested action.\r\n\r\nS----i was no sooner informed of my arrival, than he hastened to obey\r\nthe invitation to meet me at dinner, and, by his presence, enlivened\r\nthe family party. After spending a most agreeable day, I retired to a\r\ntemporary lodging, which B----a had procured me in the neighbourhood.\r\nI shall remain in it no longer than till I can suit myself with\r\napartments in a private house, where I can be more retired, or at\r\nleast subject to less noise, than in a public hotel.\r\n\r\nOf the fifty-eight hours which I employed in performing my journey\r\nhither from London, forty-four were spent on my way between Calais\r\nand Paris; a distance that I have often travelled with ease in\r\nthirty-six, when the roads were in tolerable repair. Considerable\r\ndelay too is at present occasioned by the erection of _barrières_, or\r\nturnpike-bars, which did not exist before the revolution. At this\r\nday, they are established throughout all the departments, and are an\r\ninsuperable impediment to expedition; for, at night, the\r\ntoll-gatherers are fast asleep, and the bars being secured, you are\r\nobliged to wait patiently till these good citizens choose to rise\r\nfrom their pillow.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance this inconvenience, you are not now plagued, as\r\nformerly, by custom-house officers on the frontiers of _every_\r\ndepartment. My baggage being once searched at _Calais_, experienced\r\nno other visit; but, at the upper town of _Boulogne_, a sight of my\r\ntravelling passport was required; by mistake in the dark, I gave the\r\n_commis_ a scrawl, put into my hands by Ducrocq, containing an\r\naccount of the best inns on the road. Would you believe that this\r\ninadvertency detained us a considerable time, so extremely\r\ninquisitive are they, at the present moment, respecting all papers?\r\nAt _Calais_, the custom-house officers even examined every piece of\r\npaper used in the packing of my baggage. This scrutiny is not\r\nparticularly adopted towards Englishmen; but must, I understand, be\r\nundergone by travellers of every country, on entering the territory\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\n_P. S._ Lord Cornwallis is expected with impatience; and, at _St.\r\nDenis_, an escort of dragoons of the 19th demi-brigade is in waiting\r\nto attend him into Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 21, 1801._\r\n\r\nOn approaching this capital, my curiosity was excited in the highest\r\ndegree; and, as the carriage passed rapidly along from the\r\n_Barrière_, through the _Porte St. Denis_, to the _Rue neuve St.\r\nRoch_, my eyes wandered in all directions, anxiously seeking every\r\nshade of distinction between _monarchical_ and _republican_ Paris.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracted my attention, on entering the\r\n_faubourg_, was the vast number of inscriptions placed, during the\r\nrevolution, on many of the principal houses; but more especially on\r\npublic buildings of every description. They are painted in large,\r\nconspicuous letters; and the following is the most general style in\r\nwhich they have been originally worded:\r\n\r\n  \"RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE, UNE ET INDIVISIBLE.\"\r\n  \"LIBERTÉ, ÉGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ, OU LA MORT.\"\r\n\r\nSince the exit of the French Nero, the last three words \"_ou la\r\nmort_\" have been obliterated, but in few places are so completely\r\neffaced as not to be still legible. In front of all the public\r\noffices and national establishments, the tri-coloured flag is\r\ntriumphantly displayed; and almost every person you meet wears in his\r\nhat the national cockade.\r\n\r\nThe tumult which, ten or twelve years ago, rendered the streets of\r\nParis so noisy, so dirty, and at the same time so dangerous, is now\r\nmost sensibly diminished. Boileau's picture of them is no longer\r\njust. No longer are seen those scenes of confusion occasioned by the\r\nfrequent stoppages of coaches and carts, and the contentions of the\r\nvociferating drivers. You may now pass the longest and most crowded\r\nthoroughfares, either on foot or otherwise, without obstacle or\r\ninconvenience. The contrast is striking.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from what I have observed, I should presume that there is\r\nnot, at the present day, one tenth part of the number of carriages\r\nwhich were in use here in 1780-90. Except on the domestics of foreign\r\nambassadors and foreigners, I have as yet noticed nothing like a\r\nlivery; and, in lieu of armorial bearings, every carriage, without\r\ndistinction, has a number painted on the pannel. However, if private\r\nequipages are scarce, thence ensues more than one advantage; the\r\npublic are indemnified by an increased number of good hackney\r\ncoaches, chariots, and cabriolets; and, besides, as I have just\r\nhinted, pedestrians are not only far less exposed to being\r\nbespattered, but also to having their limbs fractured.\r\n\r\nFormerly, a _seigneur de la cour_ conceived himself justified in\r\nsuffering his coachman to drive at a mischievous rate; and in narrow,\r\ncrowded streets, where there is no foot-pavement, it was extremely\r\ndifficult for persons walking to escape the wheels of a great number\r\nof carriages rattling along in this shameful manner. But he who\r\nguided the chariot of a _ministre d'état_, considered it as a\r\nnecessary and distinctive mark of his master's pre-eminence to\r\n_brûler le pavé_. This is so strictly true, that, before the\r\nrevolution, I have here witnessed repeated accidents of the most\r\nserious nature, resulting from the exercise of this sort of\r\nministerial privilege: on one occasion particularly, I myself\r\nnarrowly escaped unhurt, when a decent, elderly woman was thrown\r\ndown, close by my feet, and had both her thighs broken through the\r\nunfeeling wantonness of the coachman of the Baron de Breteuil, at\r\nthat time minister for the department of Paris.\r\n\r\nOwing to the salutary regulations of the police, the recurrence of\r\nthese accidents is now, in a great measure, prevented; and, as the\r\nempirics say in their hand-bills: \"_Prevention is better than cure._\"\r\n\r\nBut for these differences, a person who had not seen Paris for some\r\nyears, might, unless he were to direct his visits to particular\r\nquarters, cross it from one extremity to the other, without remarking\r\nany change to inform his mind, that here had been a revolution, or\r\nrather that, for the last ten years, this city had been almost one\r\ncontinual scene of revolutions.\r\n\r\nBossnet, once preaching before Lewis XIV, exclaimed: \"Kings die, and\r\nso do kingdoms!\" Could that great preacher rise from his grave into\r\nthe pulpit, and behold France without a king, and that kingdom, not\r\ncrumbled away, but enlarged, almost with the rapid accumulation of a\r\nsnow-ball, into an enormous mass of territory, under the title of\r\nFrench Republic, what would he not have to say in a sermon? _Rien de\r\nnouveau sous le ciel_, though an old proverb, would not now suit as a\r\nmaxim. This, in fact, seems the age of wonders. The league of\r\nmonarchs has ended by producing republics; while a republic has\r\nraised a dukedom into a monarchy, and, by its vast preponderance,\r\ncompletely overturned the balance of power.\r\n\r\nNot knowing when I may have an opportunity of sending this letter, I\r\nshall defer to close it for the present, as I may possibly lengthen\r\nit. But you must not expect much order in my narrations. I throw my\r\nthoughts on paper just as they happen to present themselves, without\r\nany studied arrangement.\r\n\r\n_October 21, in continuation_.\r\n\r\nWhen we have been for some time in the habit of corresponding with\r\nstrangers, we are apt to draw such inferences from their language and\r\nstyle, as furnish us with the means of sketching an ideal portrait of\r\ntheir person. This was the case with myself.\r\n\r\nThrough the concurrence of the two governments, I had, as you know,\r\nparticipated, in common with others, in the indulgence of being\r\npermitted to correspond, occasionally, on subjects of literature with\r\nseveral of the _savans_ and literati of France. Indeed, the principal\r\nmotive of my journey to Paris was to improve that sort of\r\nacquaintance, by personal intercourse, so as to render it more\r\ninteresting to both parties. In my imagination, I had drawn a\r\nfull-length picture of most of my literary correspondents. I was now\r\nanxious to see the originals, and compare the resemblance.\r\n\r\nYesterday, having first paid my respects to Mr. M----y, the successor\r\nto Captain C----s, as commissary for the maintenance and exchange of\r\nBritish prisoners of war, and at present _Chargé d'affaires_ from our\r\ncourt to the French Republic, I called on M. F----u, formerly\r\nminister of the naval department, and at present counsellor of state,\r\nand member of the National Institute, as well as of the board of\r\nlongitude. I then visited M. O----r, and afterwards M.\r\nL------re, also members of the Institute, and both well known to our\r\nproficients in natural history, by the works which each has published\r\nin the different branches of that interesting science.\r\n\r\nIn one only of my ideal portraits had I been very wide of the\r\nlikeness. However, without pretending to be a Lavater, I may affirm\r\nthat I should not have risked falling into a mistake like that\r\ncommitted, on a somewhat similar occasion, by Voltaire.\r\n\r\nThis colossus of French literature, having been for a long time in\r\ncorrespondence with the great Frederic, became particularly anxious\r\nto see that monarch. On his arrival in a village where the\r\nhead-quarters of the Prussian army were then established, Voltaire\r\ninquired for the king's lodging: thither he paced with redoubled\r\nspeed; and, being directed to the upper part of the house, he hastily\r\ncrossed a large garret; he then found himself in a second, and was\r\njust on the point of entering the third, when, on turning round, he\r\nperceived in one of the comers of the room, a soldier, not overclean\r\nin appearance, lying on a sorry bedstead. He went up and said to him\r\nwith eagerness: \"Where's the king?\"--\"I am Frederic,\" replied the\r\nsoldier; and, sure enough, it was the monarch himself.\r\n\r\nI am now settled in my new apartments, which are situated in the most\r\ncentrical part of Paris. When you visit this capital, I would by all\r\nmeans, recommend to you, should you intend to remain here a few\r\nweeks, to get into private lodgings.\r\n\r\nI know of no article here so much augmented in price, within the last\r\nten years, as the apartments in all the hotels. After looking at\r\nseveral of them in the _Rue de la Loi_, accompanied by a French\r\nfriend, who was so obliging as to take on himself all the trouble of\r\ninquiry, while I remained a silent bystander, I had the curiosity to\r\ngo to the _Hôtel d'Angleterre_, in the _Rue des Filles St. Thomas_,\r\nhot far from the _ci-devant Palais Royal_. The same apartments on the\r\nfirst floor of this hotel which I occupied in 1789, happened to be\r\nvacant. At that time I paid for them twelve louis d'or a month; the\r\nfurniture was then new; it is now much the worse for nearly eleven\r\nyears' wear; and the present landlord asked twenty-five louis a\r\nmonth, and even refused twenty-two, if taken for three months\r\ncertain. The fact is, that all the landlords of ready-furnished\r\nhotels in Paris seem to be buoyed up with an idea that, on the peace,\r\nthe English and foreigners of other nations will flock hither in such\r\nnumbers as to enable them to reap a certain and plentiful harvest.\r\nNot but all lodgings are considerably increased in price, which is\r\nascribed to the increase of taxes.\r\n\r\nTo find private lodgings, you have only to cast your eye on the daily\r\nadvertiser of Paris, called _Les Petites Affiches_. There I read a\r\ndescription of my present quarters, which are newly fitted up in\r\nevery particular, and, I assure you, with no small degree of tasteful\r\nfancy. My landlady, who is a milliner, and, for aught I know, a very\r\nfashionable one, left not the smallest convenience to my conjecture,\r\nbut explained the particular use of every hole and corner in the most\r\nsignificant manner, not even excepting the _boudoir_.\r\n\r\nThis would be a most excellent situation for any one whose principal\r\nobject was to practise speaking French; for, on the right hand of the\r\n_porte-cochère_ or gateway, (which, by the bye, is here reckoned an\r\nindispensable appendage to a proper lodging), is the _magazin des\r\nmodes_, where my landlady presides over twenty damsels, many of whom,\r\nthough assiduously occupied in making caps and bonnets, would, I am\r\npersuaded, find repartee for the most witty gallant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 23, 1801._\r\n\r\nSince my arrival, I have been so much engaged in paying and receiving\r\nvisits, that I really have not yet been able to take even a hasty\r\nview of any of the grand sights introduced here since the revolution,\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday I dined with M. S----i, whose new 8vo edition of Buffon\r\nproceeds, I find, with becoming spirit. It is quite a journey to his\r\nresidence; for he lives in one of the most retired quarters of Paris,\r\nHowever, I had no reason to repine at the distance, as the party was\r\nexceedingly cheerful. Naturalists and literati were not wanting.\r\n\r\nEgypt was a subject that engrossed much of the conversation: it was\r\nmentioned as a matter of regret that, during the dominion of the\r\nFrench in that country, curiosity had not prompted the Institute,\r\nestablished at Cairo, to open one of the pyramids, with a view of\r\nascertaining the object of the erection of those vast masses. At the\r\ndesert, we had luscious grapes as large as damsons, in bunches of\r\nfrom three to five pounds in weight. They were of the species of the\r\nfamous _chasselas de Fontainebleau_, which are said to have sprung\r\nfrom a stock of vine-plants, imported by Francis I. from the island\r\nof Cyprus. These did not come from that town, but grew against the\r\nnaked wall in S----i's garden. From this you may form a judgment of\r\nthe climate of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe persons with whom I have had any correspondence, respecting\r\nliterature, vie with each other in shewing me every mark of cordial\r\nhospitality; and those to whom I have been introduced, are by no\r\nmeans backward in friendly attention. All the lovers of science here\r\nseem to rejoice that the communication, which has been so long\r\ninterrupted between the two countries, promises to be shortly\r\nre-opened.\r\n\r\nAfter dining yesterday with Mr. M----y, the British minister, in\r\ncompany with Mr. D----n, the member for Ilchester, we all three went\r\nto an exhibition almost facing Mr. M----y's residence  in the _Rue\r\nSt. Dominique_. This was the third time of its being open to the\r\npublic. As it is of a novel kind, some account of it may not be\r\nuninteresting. In French, it is denominated\r\n\r\n  THERMOLAMPES,\r\n  _or stoves which afford heat and light on an economical plan_.\r\n\r\nThe author of this invention, for which a patent has been obtained,\r\nis M. LEBON, an engineer of bridges and highways. The place of\r\nexhibition was the ground floor of one of the large hotels in the\r\n_Faubourg St. Germain_, on which was a suite of rooms, extremely\r\nfavourable for displaying the effect of this new method of lighting\r\nand warming apartments.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of fire or candle, on the chimney stood a large crystal\r\nglobe, in which appeared a bright and clear flame diffusing a very\r\nagreeable heat; and on different pieces of furniture were placed\r\ncandlesticks with metal candles, from the top of each of which issued\r\na steady light, like that of a lamp burning with spirits of wine.\r\nThese different receptacles were supplied with inflammable gas by\r\nmeans of tubes communicating with an apparatus underneath. By this\r\ncontrivance, in short, all the apartments were warmed very\r\ncomfortably, and illuminated in a brilliant manner.\r\n\r\nOn consulting M. LEBON, he communicated to me the following\r\nobservations: \"You may have remarked,\" said he, \"in sitting before a\r\nfire, that wood sometimes burns without flame, but with much smoke,\r\nand then you experience little heat, sometimes with flame, but with\r\nlittle smoke, and then you find much warmth. You may have remarked\r\ntoo, that ill-made charcoal emits smoke; it is, on that account,\r\nsusceptible of flaming again; and the characteristic difference\r\nbetween wood and charcoal is, that the latter has lost, together with\r\nits smoke, the principle and aliment of flame, without which you\r\nobtain but little heat. Experience next informs us, that this portion\r\nof smoke, the aliment of flame, is not an oily vapour condensable by\r\ncooling, but a gas, a permanent air, which may be washed, purified,\r\nconducted, distributed, and afterwards turned into flame at any\r\ndistance from the hearth.\r\n\r\n\"It is almost needless,\" continued he, \"to point out the formation of\r\nverdigrise, white lead, and a quantity of other operations, in which\r\nacetous acid is employed. I shall only remark that it is this\r\npyroligneous acid which penetrates smoked meat and fish, that it has\r\nan effect on leather which it hardens, and that _thermolampes_ are\r\nlikely to render tanning-mills unnecessary, by furnishing the tan\r\nwithout further trouble. But to return to the aëriform principle.\r\n\r\n\"This aliment of flame is deprived of those humid vapours, so\r\nperceptible and so disagreeable to the organs of sight and smell.\r\nPurified to a perfect transparency, it floats in the state of cold\r\nair, and suffers itself to be directed by the smallest and most\r\nfragil pipes. Chimnies of an inch square, made in the thickness of\r\nthe plaster of ceilings or walls, tubes even of gummed silk would\r\nanswer this purpose. The end alone of the tube, which, by bringing\r\nthe inflammable gas into contact with the atmospheric air, allows it\r\nto catch fire, and on which the flame reposes, ought to be of metal.\r\n\r\n\"By a distribution so easy to be established, a single stove may\r\nsupply the place of all the chimnies of a house. Every where\r\ninflammable air is ready to diffuse immediately heat and light of the\r\nmost glowing or most mild nature, simultaneously or separately,\r\naccording to your wishes. In the twinkling of an eye, you may conduct\r\nthe flame from one room to another; an advantage equally convenient\r\nand economical, and which can never be obtained with our common\r\nstoves and chimnies. No sparks, no charcoal, no soot, to trouble you;\r\nno ashes, no wood, to soil your apartments. By night, as well as by\r\nday, you can have a fire in your room, without a servant being\r\nobliged to look after it. Nothing in the _thermolampes_, not even the\r\nsmallest portion of inflammable air, can escape combustion; while in\r\nour chimnies, torrents evaporate, and even carry off with them the\r\ngreater part of the heat produced.\r\n\r\n\"The advantage of being able to purify and proportion, in some\r\nmeasure, the principles of the gas which feeds the flame is,\" said M.\r\nLEBON, \"set forth in the clearest manner. But this flame is so\r\nsubjected to our caprice, that even to tranquilize the imagination,\r\nit suffers itself to be confined in a crystal globe, which is never\r\ntarnished, and thus presents a filter pervious to light and heat. A\r\npart of the tube that conducts the inflammable air, carries off, out\r\nof doors, the produce of this combustion, which, nevertheless,\r\naccording to the experiments of modern chymists, can scarcely be any\r\nthing more than an aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\n\"Who cannot but be fond of having recourse to a flame so subservient?\r\nIt will dress your victuals, which, as well as your cooks, will not\r\nbe exposed to the vapour of charcoal; it will warm again those dishes\r\non your table; dry your linen; heat your oven, and the water for your\r\nbaths or your washing, with every economical advantage that can be\r\nwished. No moist or black vapours; no ashes, no breaze, to make a\r\ndirt, or oppose the communication of heat; no useless loss of\r\ncaloric; you may, by shutting an opening, which is no longer\r\nnecessary for placing the wood in your oven, compress and coerce the\r\ntorrents of heat that were escaping from it.\r\n\r\n\"It may easily be conceived, that an inflammable principle so docile\r\nand so active may be made to yield the most magnificent\r\nilluminations. Streams of fire finely drawn out, the duration,\r\ncolour, and form of which may be varied at pleasure, the motion of\r\nsuns and turning-columns, must produce an effect no less agreeable\r\nthan brilliant.\" Indeed, this effect was exhibited on the garden\r\nfaçade of M. LEBON'S residence.\r\n\r\n\"Wood,\" concluded he, \"yields in condensable vapours two thirds of\r\nits weight; those vapours may therefore be employed to produce the\r\neffects of our steam-engines, and it is needless to borrow this\r\nsuccour from foreign water.\"\r\n\r\n_P. S._. On the 1st of last Vendémiaire, (23rd of September), the\r\ngovernment presented to the Chief Consul a sword, whose hilt was\r\nadorned with fourteen diamonds, the largest of which, called the\r\n_Regent_, from its having been purchased by the Duke of Orleans, when\r\nRegent, weighs 184 carats. This is the celebrated _Pitt_ diamond, of\r\nwhich we have heard so much: but its weight is exceeded by that of\r\nthe diamond purchased by the late empress of Russia, which weighs 194\r\ncarats; not to speak of the more famous diamond, in possession of the\r\nGreat Mogul, which is said to weigh 280 carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 24, 1801._\r\n\r\nLast night I received yours of the 20th ult. and as Mr. M----y\r\npurposes to send off a dispatch this morning, and will do me the\r\nfavour to forward this, with my former letters, I hasten to write you\r\na few lines.\r\n\r\nI scarcely need assure you, my dear friend, that I will, with\r\npleasure, communicate to you my remarks on this great city and its\r\ninhabitants, and describe to you, as far as I am able, the principal\r\ncuriosities which it contains, particularizing, as you desire, those\r\nrecently placed here by the chance of war; and giving you a succinct,\r\nhistorical account of the most remarkable national establishments and\r\npublic buildings. But to pass in review the present state of the\r\n_arts, sciences, literature, manners, &c. &c._ in this capital, and\r\ncontrast it with that which existed before the revolution, is a task\r\nindeed; and far more, I fear, than it will be in my power to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you will be content to gather my observations as they\r\noccur; to listen to my reflections, while the impression of the\r\ndifferent scenes which produced them, is still warm in my mind; in\r\nshort, to take a faithful sketch, in lieu of a finished picture, I\r\nwill do the best I can for your satisfaction.\r\n\r\nRelying on your indulgence, you shall know the life I lead: I will,\r\nas it were, take you by the arm, and, wherever I go, you shall be my\r\ncompanion. Perhaps, by pursuing this plan, you will not, at the\r\nexpiration of three or four months, think your time unprofitably\r\nspent. Aided by the experience acquired by having occasionally\r\nresided here, for several months together, before the revolution, it\r\nwill be my endeavour to make you as well acquainted with Paris, as I\r\nshall then hope to be myself. For this purpose, I will lay under\r\ncontribution every authority, both written and oral, worthy of being\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 26, 1801._\r\n\r\nFrom particular passages in your letter, I clearly perceive your\r\nanxiety to be introduced among those valuable antiques which now\r\nadorn the banks of the Seine. On that account, I determined to\r\npostpone all other matters, and pay my first visit to the CENTRAL\r\nMUSEUM OF THE ARTS, established in the\r\n\r\nLOUVRE.\r\n\r\nBut, before, we enter the interior of this building, it may not be\r\namiss to give you some account of its construction, and describe to\r\nyou its exterior beauties.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this palace, as well as the etymology of its name, is\r\nlost in the darkness of time. It is certain, however, that it\r\nexisted, under the appellation of _Louvre_, in the reign of Philip\r\nAugustus, who surrounded it with ditches and towers, and made it a\r\nfortress. The great tower of the _Louvre_, celebrated in history, was\r\ninsulated, and built in the middle of the court. All the great\r\nfeudatories of the crown derived their tenure from this tower, and\r\ncame hither to swear allegiance and pay homage. \"It was,\" says St.\r\nFoix, \"a prison previously prepared for them, if they violated their\r\noaths.\"[1] Three Counts of Flanders were confined in it at different\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe _Louvre_, far from being cheerful from its construction, received\r\nalso from this enormous tower a melancholy and terrifying aspect\r\nwhich rendered it unworthy of being a royal residence. Charles V.\r\nendeavoured to enliven and embellish this gloomy abode, and made it\r\ntolerably commodious for those times. Several foreign monarchs\r\nsuccessively lodged in it; such as Manuel, emperor of Constantinople;\r\nSigismund, emperor of Germany; and the emperor Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\nThis large tower of the _Louvre_, which had, at different periods,\r\nserved as a palace to the kings of France, as a prison to the great\r\nlords, and as a treasury to the state, was at length taken down in\r\n1528.\r\n\r\nThe _Tower of the Library_ was famous, among several others, because\r\nit contained that of Charles V. the most considerable one of the\r\ntime, and in which the number of volumes amounted to nine hundred.\r\n\r\nOLD LOUVRE\r\n\r\nThe part of this palace which, at the present day, is called the _Old\r\nLouvre_, was begun under Francis I. from the plan of PIERRE LESCOT,\r\nabbot of Clugny; and the sculpture was executed by JEAN GOUGEON,\r\nwhose minute correctness is particularly remarkable in the festoons\r\nof the frieze of the second order, and in the devices emblematic of\r\nthe amours of Henry II. This edifice, though finished, was not\r\ninhabited during the reign of that king, but it was by his son\r\nCharles IX.\r\n\r\nUnder him, the _Louvre_ became the bloody theatre of treacheries and\r\nmassacres which time will never efface from the memory of mankind,\r\nand which, till the merciless reign of Robespierre, were unexampled\r\nin the history of this country. I mean the horrors of St.\r\nBartholemew's day.\r\n\r\nWhile the alarmed citizens were swimming across the river to escape\r\nfrom death, Charles IX. from a window of this palace, was firing at\r\nthem with his arquebuse. During that period of the revolution, when\r\nall means were employed to excite and strengthen the enmity of the\r\npeople against their kings, this act of atrocity was called to their\r\nmind by an inscription placed under the very window, which looks on\r\nthe _Quai du Louvre_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this instance of Charles's barbarity is fully corroborated by\r\nhistorians. \"When it was day-light,\" says Brantome, \"the king peeped\r\nout of his chamber-window, and seeing some people in the _Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain_ moving about and running away, he took a large arquebuse\r\nwhich he had ready at hand, and, calling out incessantly: _Kill,\r\nkill!_ fired a great many shots at them, but in vain; for the piece\r\ndid not carry so far.\"--This prince, according to Masson, piqued\r\nhimself on his dexterity in cutting off at a single blow the head of\r\nthe asses and pigs which he met with on his way. Lansac, one of his\r\nfavourites, having found him one day with his sword drawn and ready\r\nto strike his mule, asked him seriously: \"What quarrel has then\r\nhappened between His Most Christian Majesty and my mule?\" Murad Bey\r\nfar surpassed this blood-thirsty monarch in address and strength. The\r\nformer, we are told by travellers in Egypt, has been known, when\r\nriding past an ox, to cut off its head with one stroke of his\r\nscimitar.\r\n\r\nThe capital was dyed with the blood of Charles's murdered subjects.\r\nInto this very _Louvre_, into the chamber of Marguerite de Valois,\r\nthe king's sister, and even to her bed, in which she was then lying,\r\ndid the fanatics pursue the officers belonging to the court itself,\r\nas is circumstantially related by that princess in her Memoirs.\r\n\r\nLet us draw the curtain on these scenes of horror, and pass rapidly\r\nfrom this period of fanaticism and cruelty, when the _Louvre_ was\r\nstained by so many crimes to times more happy, when this palace\r\nbecame the quiet cradle of the arts and sciences, the school for\r\ntalents, the _arena_ for genius, and the asylum of artists and\r\nliterati.\r\n\r\nThe centre pavilion over the principal gate of the _Old Louvre_, was\r\nerected under the reign of Lewis XIII. from the designs of LE\r\nMERCIER, as well as the angle of the left part of the building,\r\nparallel to that built by Henry II. The eight gigantic cariatides\r\nwhich are there seen, were sculptured by SARRASIN.\r\n\r\nThe façade towards the _Jardin de l'Infante_, (as it is called), that\r\ntowards the _Place du Louvre_, and that over the little gate, towards\r\nthe river, which were constructed under the reigns of Charles IX. and\r\nHenry III. in the midst of the civil wars of the League, partake of\r\nthe taste of the time, in regard to the multiplicity of the\r\nornaments; but the interior announces, by the majesty of its\r\ndecorations, the refined taste of Lewis XIV.\r\n\r\nNEW LOUVRE.\r\n\r\nThe part of the _Louvre_, which, with the two sides of the old\r\nbuilding, forms the perfect square, three hundred and seventy-eight\r\nfeet[2] in extent, called the _New Louvre_, consists in two double\r\nfaçades, which are still unfinished. LE VEAU, and after him D'ORBAY,\r\nwere the architects under whose direction this augmentation was made\r\nby order of Lewis XIV.\r\n\r\nThat king at first resolved to continue the _Louvre_ on the plan\r\nbegun by Francis I.: for some time he caused it to be pursued, but\r\nhaving conceived a more grand and magnificent design, he ordered the\r\nfoundation of the superb edifice now standing, to be laid on the 17th\r\nof October 1665, under the administration of COLBERT.\r\n\r\nThrough a natural prejudice, Lewis XIV. thought that he could find no\r\nwhere but in Italy an artist sufficiently skilful to execute his\r\nprojects of magnificence. He sent for the Cavaliere BERNINI from\r\nRome. This artist, whose reputation was established, was received in\r\nFrance with all the pomp due to princes of the blood. The king\r\nordered that, in the towns through which he might pass, he should be\r\ncomplimented and receive presents from the corporations, &c.\r\n\r\nBERNINI was loaded with wealth and honours: notwithstanding the\r\nprepossession of the court in favour of this Italian architect,\r\nnotwithstanding his talents, he did not succeed in his enterprise.\r\nAfter having forwarded the foundation of this edifice, he made a\r\npretext of the impossibility of spending the winter in a climate\r\ncolder than that of Italy. \"He was promised,\" says St. Foix, \"three\r\nthousand louis a year if he would stay; but,\" he said, \"he would\r\npositively go and die in his _own_ country.\" On the eve of his\r\ndeparture, the king sent him three thousand louis, with the grant of\r\na pension of five hundred. He received the whole with great coolness.\r\n\r\nSeveral celebrated architects now entered the lists to complete this\r\ngrand undertaking.--MANSARD presented his plans, with which COLBERT\r\nwas extremely pleased: the king also approved of them, and absolutely\r\ninsisted on their being executed without any alteration. MANSARD\r\nreplied that he would rather renounce the glory of building this\r\nedifice than the liberty of correcting himself, and changing his\r\ndesign when he thought he could improve it. Among the competitors was\r\nCLAUDE PERRAULT, that physician so defamed by Boileau, the poet. His\r\nplans were preferred, and merited the preference. Many pleasantries\r\nwere circulated at the expense of the new medical architect; and\r\nPERRAULT replied to those sarcasms by producing the beautiful\r\ncolonnade of the _Louvre_, the master-piece of French architecture,\r\nand the admiration of all Europe.\r\n\r\nThe façade of this colonnade, which is of the Corinthian order; is\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five feet in length: it is divided into two\r\nperistyles and three avant-corps. The principal gate is in the centre\r\navant-corps, which is decorated with eight double columns, crowned by\r\na pediment, whose raking cornices are composed of two stones only,\r\neach fifty-four feet in length by eight in breadth, though no more\r\nthan eighteen inches in thickness. They were taken from the quarries\r\nof Meudon, and formed but one single block, which was sawed into two.\r\nThe other two avant-corps are ornamented by six pilasters, and two\r\ncolumns of the same order, and disposed in the same manner. On the\r\ntop, in lieu of a ridged roof, is a terrace, bordered by a stone\r\nbalustrade, the pedestals of which are intended to bear trophies\r\nintermixed with vases.\r\n\r\nPERRAULT'S enemies disputed with him the invention of this\r\nmaster-piece. They maintained that it belonged to LE VEAU, the\r\narchitect; but, since the discovery of the original manuscript and\r\ndrawings of PERRAULT, there no longer remains a doubt respecting\r\nthe real author of this beautiful production.\r\n\r\nIn front of this magnificent colonnade, a multitude of salesmen erect\r\ntheir stalls, and there display quantities of old clothes, rags, &c.\r\nThis contrast, as Mercier justly remarks, still speaks to the eye of\r\nthe attentive observer. It is the image of all the rest, grandeur and\r\nbeggary, side by side.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not on the _outside_ of these walls only, that beggary\r\nhas been so nearly allied to grandeur. At least we have a solitary\r\ninstance of this truth of a very sinking nature.\r\n\r\nCardinal de Retz tells us, that going one morning to the _Louvre_ to\r\nsee the Queen of England, he found her in the chamber of her\r\ndaughter, aftenwards Dutchess of Orleans, and that she said to him:\r\n\"You see, I come to keep Henriette company: the poor girl could not\r\nleave her bed to-day, for want of fuel.\"--It is true, he adds, that,\r\nfor six months past Cardinal Mazarin had not paid her pension; the\r\ntradesmen, would no longer give her credit, and she had not a piece\r\nof wood to warm her.\r\n\r\nLike St. Paul's in London, the façade of the _Louvre_ cannot be seen\r\nto the best advantage, on account of the proximity of the surrounding\r\nbuildings; and, like many other great undertakings too, will,\r\nprobably, never be completed, but remain a monument of the fickleness\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nLewis XIV, after having for a long time made the _Louvre_ his\r\nresidence; abandoned it for _Versailles_: \"Sire,\" said Dufreny once\r\nto that prince, \"I never look at the _New Louvre_, without\r\nexclaiming, superb monument of the magnificence of our greatest\r\nkings, you would have been finished, had you been given to one of the\r\nbegging orders of friars!\" From that period, the _Louvre_ was wholly\r\nconsecrated to the sittings of different academies, and to the\r\naccommodation of several men of science and artists, to whom free\r\napartments were allotted.\r\n\r\nI much regret having, for this year at least, lost a sight here,\r\nwhich I should have viewed with no inconsiderable degree of\r\nattention. This is the\r\n\r\nPUBLIC EXHIBITION OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF FRENCH INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nUnder the directorial government, this exhibition was opened in the\r\n_Champ de Mars_; but it now takes place, annually, in the square of\r\nthe _Louvre_, during the five complementary days of the republican\r\ncalendar; namely, from the 18th to the 22d of September, both\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition not only includes manufactures of every sort, but also\r\nevery new discovery, invention, and improvement. For the purpose of\r\ndisplaying these objects to advantage, temporary buildings are\r\nerected along the four interior walls of this square, each of which\r\nare subdivided into twenty-five porticoes; so that the whole square\r\nof the _Louvre_, during that period, represents a fair with a hundred\r\nbooths. The resemblance, I am told, is rendered still more perfect by\r\nthe prodigious crowd; persons of all ranks being indiscriminately\r\nadmitted to view these productions. Precautions, however, are taken\r\nto prevent the indiscreet part of the public from rushing into the\r\nporticoes, and sentinels are posted at certain intervals to preserve\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThis, undoubtedly, is a very laudable institution, and extremely well\r\ncalculated to excite emulation in the national manufactures,\r\nspecimens of which being sent from all the principal manufacturing\r\ntowns, the hundred porticoes may be said to comprise an epitome of\r\nthe present state of all the flourishing manufactures of France.\r\nIndeed, none but new inventions and articles of finished workmanship,\r\nthe fabrication of which is known, are suffered to make part of the\r\nexhibition. Even these are not admitted till after a previous\r\nexamination, and on the certificate of a private jury of five\r\nmembers, appointed for that purpose by the prefect of each\r\ndepartment. A new jury, composed of fifteen members, nominated by the\r\nMinister of the Interior, again examine the different articles\r\nadmitted; and agreeably to their decision, the government award\r\npremiums and medals to those persons who have made the greatest\r\nimprovement in any particular fabric or branch of industry, or\r\nproduced any new discovery or invention. The successful candidates\r\nare presented to the Chief Consul by the Minister of the Interior,\r\nand have the honour of dining with him at his public monthly dinner.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I can learn concerning this interesting exhibition, it\r\nappears, that, though the useful arts, in general, cannot at present\r\nbe put in competition here with those of a similar description among\r\nus, the object of the French government is to keep up a spirit of\r\nrivalship, and encourage, by every possible means, the improvement of\r\nthose manufactures in which England is acknowledged to surpass other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nI am reminded that it is time to prepare for going out to dinner. I\r\nmust therefore not leave this letter, like the _Louvre_, unfinished.\r\nFortunately, my good friend, the prevailing fashion here is to dine\r\nvery late, which leaves me a long morning; but for this, I know not\r\nwhen I should have an opportunity of writing long letters. Restrain\r\nthen your impatience, and I promise that you shall very shortly be\r\nushered into the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES,\r\n\r\n  \"Where the smooth chisel all its force has shewn,\r\n  And soften'd into flesh the rugged stone.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Essais historiques sur Paris_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It may be necessary to observe that, throughout these\r\nletters, we always speak of French feet. The English foot is to the\r\nFrench as 12 to 12.789, or as 4 to 4.263.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 28, 1801._\r\n\r\nHaving, in my last letter, described to you the outside of the\r\n_Louvre_, (with the exception of the Great Gallery, of which I shall\r\nspeak more at length in another place), I shall now proceed to give\r\nyou an account of some of the principal national establishments\r\ncontained within its walls.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the _Louvre_ was, as I have said, the seat of\r\ndifferent academies, such as the _French Academy_, the _Academy of\r\nSciences_, the _Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres_, the\r\n_Academy of Painting and Sculpture_, and the _Academy of\r\nArchitecture_. All these are replaced by the _National Institute of\r\nArts and Sciences_, of which, however, I shall postpone further\r\nmention till I conduct you to one of its public sittings.\r\n\r\nAt the period to which I revert, there existed in the _Louvre_ a\r\nhall, called the _Salle des Antiques_, where, besides, some original\r\nstatues by French artists, were assembled models in plaster of the\r\nmost celebrated master-pieces of sculpture in Italy, together with a\r\nsmall number of antiques. In another apartment, forming part of those\r\nassigned to the Academy of Painting, and called the _Galérie\r\nd'Apollon_, were seen several pictures, chiefly of the French school;\r\nand it was intended that the Great Gallery should be formed into a\r\nMuseum, containing a collection of the finest pictures and statues at\r\nthe disposal of the crown.\r\n\r\nThis plan, which had partly been carried into execution under the old\r\n_régime_, is now completed, but in a manner infinitely more\r\nmagnificent than could possibly have been effected without the\r\nadvantages of conquest. The _Great Gallery_ and _Saloon_ of the\r\n_Louvre_ are solely appropriated to the exhibition of pictures of the\r\nold masters of the Italian, Flemish, and French schools; and the\r\n_Gallery of Apollo_ to that of their drawings; while a suite of lofty\r\napartments has been purposely fitted up in this palace for the\r\nreception of original antiques, in lieu of those copies of them\r\nbefore-mentioned. In other rooms, adjoining to the Great Gallery, are\r\nexhibited, as formerly, that is during one month every year, the\r\nproductions of living painters, sculptors, architects, and\r\ndraughtsmen.\r\n\r\nThese different exhibitions are placed under the superintendance of a\r\nboard of management, or an administration, (as the French term it),\r\ncomposed of a number of antiquaries, artists, and men of science,\r\ninferior to none in Europe in skill, judgment, taste, or erudition.\r\nThe whole of this grand establishment bears the general title of\r\n\r\nCENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS.\r\n\r\nThe treasures of painting and sculpture which the French nation have\r\nacquired by the success of their arms, or by express conditions in\r\ntreaties of alliance or neutrality, are so immense as to enable them,\r\nnot only to render this CENTRAL MUSEUM the grandest collection of\r\nmaster-pieces in the world, but also to establish fifteen\r\ndepartmental Museums in fifteen of the principal towns of France.\r\nThis measure, evidently intended to favour the progress of the fine\r\narts, will case Paris of a great number of the pictures, statues, &c.\r\namassed here from different parts of France, Germany, Belgium,\r\nHolland, Italy, Piedmont, Savoy, and the States of. Venice.\r\n\r\nIf you cast your eye on the annexed _Plan of Paris_, and suppose\r\nyourself near the exterior south-west angle of the _Louvre_, or, as\r\nit is more emphatically styled, the NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND\r\nSCIENCES, you will be in the right-hand corner of the _Place du Vieux\r\nLouvre_, in which quarter is the present entrance to the CENTRAL\r\nMUSEUM OF THE ARTS. Here, after passing through a court, you enter a\r\nvestibule, on the left of which is the Hall of the Administration of\r\nthe Museum. On the ground-floor, facing the door of this vestibule,\r\nis the entrance to the\r\n\r\nGALLERY OF ANTIQUES.\r\n\r\nIn this gallery, which was, for the first time, opened to the public\r\non the 18th of Brumaire, year ix. of the French republic, (9th of\r\nNovember 1800), are now distributed no less than one hundred and\r\nforty-six statues, busts, and bas-reliefs. It consists of several\r\nhandsome apartments, bearing appropriate denominations, according to\r\nthe principal subjects which each contains. Six only are at present\r\ncompletely arranged for public inspection: but many others are in a\r\nstate of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the statues here exhibited, are the fruit of the\r\nconquests of the army of Italy. Conformably to the treaty of\r\nTolentino, they were selected at Rome, from the Capitol and the\r\nVatican, by BARTHÉLEMY, BERTHOLET, MOITTE, MONGE, THOUIN, and TINET,\r\nwho were appointed, by the French government, commissioners for the\r\nresearch of objects appertaining to the Arts and Sciences.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule, for the moderate price of fifteen _sous_, is sold a\r\ncatalogue, which is not merely a barren index, but a perspicuous and\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the different objects that strike the eye\r\nof the admiring spectator as he traverses the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. It\r\nis by no means my intention to transcribe this catalogue, or to\r\nmention every statue; but, assisted by the valuable observations with\r\nwhich I was favoured by the learned antiquary, VISCONTI, long\r\ndistinguished for his profound knowledge of the fine arts, I shall\r\ndescribe the most remarkable only, and such as would fix the\r\nattention of the connoisseur.\r\n\r\nOn entering the gallery, you might, perhaps, be tempted to stop in\r\nthe first hall; but we will visit them all in regular succession, and\r\nproceed to that which is now the furthest on the left hand. The\r\nceiling of this apartment, painted by ROMANELLI, represents the four\r\nseasons; whence it is called the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE SEASONS.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, among other antiques, here are placed the statues of\r\nthe rustic divinities, and those relating to the Seasons. Of the\r\nwhole, I shall distinguish the following:\r\n\r\n  N° 210. DIANA.\r\n\r\nDiana, habited as a huntress, in a short tunic without sleeves, is\r\nholding her bow in one hand; while, with the other, she is drawing an\r\narrow from her quiver, which is suspended at her shoulder. Her legs\r\nare bare, and her feet are adorned with rich sandals. The goddess,\r\nwith a look expressive of indignation, appears to be defending the\r\nfabulous hind from the pursuit of Hercules, who, in obedience to the\r\noracle of Apollo, was pursuing it, in order to carry it alive to\r\nEurystheus; a task imposed on him by the latter as one of his twelve\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nTo say that, in the opinion of the first-rate connoisseurs, this\r\nstatue might serve as a companion to the _Apollo of Belvedere_, is\r\nsufficient to convey an idea of its perfection; and, in fact, it is\r\nreckoned the finest representation of Diana in existence. It is of\r\nParian marble, and, according to historians, has been in France ever\r\nsince the reign of Henry IV. It was the most perfect of the antiques\r\nwhich adorned the Gallery of Versailles. The parts wanting have been\r\nrecently restored with such skill as to claim particular admiration.\r\n\r\n  214. ROME.\r\n\r\nIn this bust, the city of Rome is personified as an Amazon. The\r\nhelmet of the female warrior is adorned with a representation of the\r\nshe-wolf, suckling the children of Mars.\r\n\r\nThis antique, of Parian marble, is of a perfect Greek style, and in\r\nadmirable preservation. It formerly belonged to the Gallery of\r\nRichelieu-Castle.\r\n\r\n  51. ADOLESCENS SPINAM AVELLENS.\r\n\r\nThis bronze figure represents a young man seated, who seems employed\r\nin extracting a thorn from his left foot.\r\n\r\nIt is a production of the flourishing period of the art, but,\r\naccording to appearance, anterior to the reign of Alexander the\r\nGreat. It partakes a little of the meagre style of the old Greek\r\nschool; but, at the same time, is finished with astonishing truth,\r\nand exhibits a graceful simplicity of expression. In what place it\r\nwas originally discovered is not known. It was taken from the\r\nCapitol, where it was seen in the _Palazzo dei Conservatori_.\r\n\r\n  50. A FAUN, _in a resting posture_.\r\n\r\nThis young faun, with no other covering than a deer's skin thrown\r\nover his shoulders, is standing with his legs crossed, and leaning on\r\nthe trunk of a tree, as if resting himself.\r\n\r\nThe grace and finished execution that reign throughout this figure,\r\nas well as the immense number of copies still existing of it, and all\r\nantiques, occasion it to be considered as the copy of the Faun in\r\nbronze, (or Satyr as it is termed by the Greeks), of Praxiteles. That\r\nstatue was so celebrated, that the epithet of [Greek: perizoætos], or\r\nthe famous, became its distinctive appellation throughout Greece.\r\n\r\nThis Faun is of Pentelic marble: it was found in 1701, near _Civita\r\nLavinia_, and placed in the Capitol by Benedict XIV.\r\n\r\n  59. ARIADNE, _known by the name of_ CLEOPATRA.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful figure, Ariadne is represented asleep on a rock in\r\nthe Isle of Naxos, abandoned by the faithless Theseus, and at the\r\nmoment when Bacchus became enamoured of her, as described by several\r\nancient poets.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how the expression of sleep could be mistaken for\r\nthat of death, and cause this figure to be called _Cleopatra_. The\r\nserpent on the upper part of the left arm is evidently a bracelet, of\r\nthat figure which the Greek women called [Greek: opidion], or the\r\nlittle serpent.\r\n\r\nFor three successive centuries, this statue of Parian marble\r\nconstituted one of the principal ornaments of the Belvedere of the\r\nVatican, where it was placed by Julius II.\r\n\r\n  190. AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\nThis head of Augustus, adorned with the civic crown of oak leaves, is\r\none of the fine portraits of that emperor. It is executed in Parian\r\nmarble, and comes from Verona, where it was admired in the\r\n_Bevilacqua_ cabinet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn quitting the HALL OF THE SEASONS, we return to that through which\r\nwe first passed to reach it. This apartment, from being ornamented\r\nwith the statues of ZENO, TRAJAN, DEMOSTHENES, and PHOCION, is\r\ndenominated the\r\n\r\nHALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN.\r\n\r\nIt is decorated with eight antique granite pillars brought from\r\n_Aix-la-Chapelle_, where they stood in the nave of the church, which\r\ncontained the tomb of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nAmong the antiques placed in it, I shall particularize\r\n\r\n  N° 75. MENANDER.\r\n\r\nThis figure represents the poet, honoured by the Greeks with the\r\ntitle of _Prince of the New Comedy_, sitting on a hemi-cycle, or\r\nsemicircular seat, and resting after his literary labours. He is clad\r\nin the Grecian tunic and _pallium_.\r\n\r\n  76. POSIDIPPUS.\r\n\r\nThe dress of Posidippus, who was reckoned among the Greeks one of the\r\nbest authors of what was called the _New Comedy_, is nearly that of\r\nMenander, the poet. Like him, he is represented sitting on a\r\nhemi-cycle.\r\n\r\nThese two statues, which are companions, are admirable for the noble\r\nsimplicity of their execution. They are both of Pentelic marble, and\r\nwere found in the XVIth century at Rome, in the gardens of the\r\nconvent of _San Lorenzo_, on Mount Viminal. After making part of the\r\nbaths of Olympius, they were placed by Sixtus V. at _Negroni_, whence\r\nthey were removed to the Vatican by Pius VI.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nContinuing our examination, after leaving the HALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS\r\nMEN, we next come to the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE ROMANS.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of this hall is ornamented with subjects taken from the\r\nRoman history, painted by ROMANELLI; and in it are chiefly assembled\r\nsuch works of sculpture as have a relation to that people.\r\n\r\nAmong several busts and statues, representing ADRIAN, PUBLIUS\r\nCORNELIUS SCIPIO, MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, CICERO,\r\n&c. I shall point out to your notice,\r\n\r\n  209. _The_ TORSO _of_ BELVEDERE.\r\n\r\nThis admirable remnant of a figure seated, though the head, arms, and\r\nlegs are wanting, represents the apotheosis of Hercules. The lion's\r\nskin spread on the rock, and the enormous size of the limbs, leave no\r\ndoubt as to the subject of the statue. Notwithstanding the muscles\r\nare strongly marked, the veins in the body of the hero are\r\nsuppressed, whence antiquaries have inferred, that the intention of\r\nthe author was to indicate the very moment of his deification.\r\nAccording to this idea, our countryman FLAXMAN has immortalized\r\nhimself by restoring a copy of the _Torso_, and placing Hebe on the\r\nleft of Hercules, in the act of presenting to him the cup of\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nOn the rock, where the figure is seated, is the following Greek\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: APOLLONIOS]\r\n  [Greek: NESTOROS]\r\n  [Greek: ATÆNAIOS]\r\n  [Greek: EPOIEI.]\r\n\r\nBy which we are informed, that it is the production of APOLLONIUS,\r\n_the Athenian, the son of Nestor_, who, probably, flourished in the\r\ntime of Pompey the Great.\r\n\r\nThis valuable antique is of Pentelic marble, and sculptured in a most\r\nmasterly style. It was found at Rome, near Pompey's theatre, now\r\n_Campo di Fiore_. Julius II. placed it in the garden of the Vatican,\r\nwhere it was long the object of the studies of MICHAEL ANGELO,\r\nRAPHAEL, &c. those illustrious geniuses, to whom we are indebted for\r\nthe improvement of the fine arts. Among artists, it has always been\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of the _Torso of Belvedere_.\r\n\r\n  94. _A wounded warrior, commonly called the_ GLADIATOR MORIENS.\r\n\r\nThis figure, represents a barbarian soldier, dying on the field of\r\nbattle, without surrendering. It is remarkable for truth of\r\nimitation, of a choice nature, though not sublime, (because the\r\nsubject would not admit of it,) and for nobleness of expression,\r\nwhich is evident without affectation.\r\n\r\nThis statue formerly belonged to the _Villa-Ludovisi_, whence it was\r\nremoved to the Museum of the Capitol by Clement XII. It is from the\r\nchisel of AGASIAS, a sculptor of Ephesus, who lived 450 years before\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\n  82. CERES.\r\n\r\nThis charming figure is rather that of a Muse than of the goddess of\r\nagriculture. It is admirable for the _ideal_ beauty of the drapery.\r\nShe is clad in a tunic; over this is thrown a mantle, the execution\r\nof which is so perfect, that, through it, are perceived the knots of\r\nthe strings which fasten the tunic below the bosom.\r\n\r\nIt formerly belonged to the _Villa-Mattei_, on Mount Esquiline; but\r\nwas taken from the Museum of the Vatican, where it had been placed by\r\nClement XIV.\r\n\r\n  80. _A Roman orator, called_ GERMANICUS.\r\n\r\nHitherto this admirable figure of a Roman orator, with the attributes\r\nof Mercury, the god of eloquence, has passed for that of Germanicus,\r\nthough it is manifestly too old for him. Here we have another model\r\nof beautiful elegance of form, though not of an _ideal_ sublimity.\r\n\r\nOn the shell of a tortoise, at tide foot of the statue, is inscribed\r\nin beautiful Greek characters:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: KLEOMENÆS]\r\n  [Greek: KLEOMENOYS]\r\n  [Greek: ATÆNIOSE]\r\n  [Greek: POIÆSEN.]\r\n\r\nWhence we learn that it is the production of CLEOMENES, an Athenian\r\nartist, mentioned by Pliny, and who flourished towards the end of the\r\nRoman republic, about 500 years before Christ. This statue was taken\r\nfrom the Gallery of Versailles, where it had been placed in the reign\r\nof Lewis XIV. It formerly belonged to the garden of Sixtus V. at\r\n_Villa-Montalto_, in Rome.\r\n\r\n  97. ANTINOÜS, _called the_ ANTINOÜS OF THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nIn this monument, Adrian's favourite is represented as having\r\nscarcely attained the age of puberty. He is naked, and his attitude\r\nhas some affinity to that of Mercury. However, his countenance seems\r\nto be impressed with that cast of melancholy, by which all his\r\nportraits are distinguished: Hence has been applied to him that verse\r\nof Virgil on Marcellus;\r\n\r\n  _\"Sed frons læta parum, et dejecto lumina vultu\"_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful figure, of Carrara marble, is sculptured in a masterly\r\nmanner. It comes from the Museum of the Capitol, and previously\r\nbelonged to the collection of Cardinal Alessandro Albani. The\r\nfore-arm and left leg are modern.\r\n\r\n  200. ANTINOÜS.\r\n\r\nIn this colossal bust of the Bithynian youth, are some peculiarities\r\nwhich call to mind the images of the Egyptian god _Harpocrates_. It\r\nis finely executed in hard Greek marble, and comes from the Museum of\r\nthe Vatican. As recently as the year 1790, it was dug from the ruins\r\nof the _Villa-Fede_ at Tivoli.\r\n\r\nBut enough for to-day--to-morrow I will resume my pen, and we will\r\ncomplete our survey of the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 29, 1801._\r\n\r\nIf the culture of the arts, by promoting industry and increasing\r\ncommerce, improves civilization, and refines manners, what modern\r\npeople can boast of such advantages as are now enjoyed by the French\r\nnation? While the sciences keep pace with the arts, good taste bids\r\nfair to spread, in time, from the capital throughout the country, and\r\nto become universal among them. In antiquity, Athens attests the\r\ntruth of this proposition, by rising, through the same means, above\r\nall the cities of Greece; and, in modern times, have we not seen in\r\nFlorence, become opulent, the darkness of ignorance vanish, like a\r\nfog, before the bright rays of knowledge, diffused by the flourishing\r\nprogress of the arts and sciences?\r\n\r\nWhen I closed my letter yesterday, we had just terminated our\r\nexamination of the HALL OF THE ROMANS. On the same line with it, the\r\nnext apartment we reach, taking its name from the celebrated group\r\nhere placed, is styled the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE LAOCOON.\r\n\r\nHere are to be admired four pillars of _verde antico_, a species of\r\ngreen marble, obtained by the ancients, from the environs of\r\nThessalonica. They were taken from the church of _Montmorency_, where\r\nthey decorated the tomb of Anne, the constable of that name. The\r\nfirst three apartments are floored with inlaid oak; but this is paved\r\nwith beautiful marble.\r\n\r\nOf the _chefs d'oeuvre_ exhibited in this hall, every person of taste\r\ncannot but feel particular gratification in examining the\r\nundermentioned;\r\n\r\n  N° 108. LAOCOON.\r\n\r\nThe pathetic story which forms the subject of this admirable group is\r\nknown to every classic reader. It is considered as one of the most\r\nperfect works that ever came from the chisel; being at once a\r\nmaster-piece of composition, design, and feeling. Any sort of\r\ncommentary could but weaken the impression which it makes on the\r\nbeholder.\r\n\r\nIt was found in 1506, under the pontificate of Julius II, at Rome, on\r\nMount Esquiline, in the ruins of the palace of Titus. The three\r\nRhodian artists, AGESANDER, POLYDORUS, and ATHENOPORUS, mentioned by\r\nPliny, as the sculptors of this _chef d'oeuvre_ flourished during the\r\ntime of the Emperors, in the first century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe group is composed of five blocks, but joined in so skilful a\r\nmanner, that Pliny thought them of one single piece. The right arm of\r\nthe father and two arms of the children are wanting.\r\n\r\n  111. AMAZON.\r\n\r\nThis uncommonly beautiful figure of Parian marble represents a woman,\r\nwhose feminine features and form seem to have contracted the\r\nimpression of the masculine habits of warfare. Clad in a very fine\r\ntunic, which, leaving the left breast exposed, is tucked up on the\r\nhips, she is in the act of bending a large bow. No attitude could be\r\nbetter calculated for exhibiting to advantage the finely-modelled\r\nperson of this heroine.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries, this statue was at the _Villa-Mattei_, on Mount\r\nCoelius at Rome, whence it was removed to the Museum of the Vatican\r\nby Clement XIV.\r\n\r\n  118. MELEAGER.\r\n\r\nThe son of OEneus, king of Calydon, with nothing but a _chlamis_\r\nfastened on his shoulders, and winding round his left arm, is here\r\nrepresented resting himself, after having killed the formidable wild\r\nboar, which was ravaging his dominions; at his side is the head of\r\nthe animal, and near him sits his faithful dog.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this group is sublime, and yet it is of a different\r\ncast, from either that of the _Apollo of Belvedere_, or that of the\r\n_Mercury_, called Antinoüs, of which we shall presently have occasion\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\nThis group is of Greek marble of a cinereous colour: there are two\r\ndifferent traditions respecting the place where it was found; but the\r\npreference is given to that of Aldroandi, who affirms that it was\r\ndiscovered in a vineyard bordering on the Tiber. It belonged to\r\nFusconi, physician to Paul III, and was for a long time in the\r\n_Pighini_ palace at Rome, whence Clement XIV had it conveyed to the\r\nVatican.\r\n\r\n  103 and 104. _Two busts, called_ TRAGEDY and COMEDY.\r\n\r\nThese colossal heads of Bacchantes adorned the entrance of the\r\ntheatre of the _Villa-Adriana_ at Tivoli. Though the execution of\r\nthem is highly finished, it is no detriment to the grandeur of the\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nThe one is of Pentelic marble; and the other, of Parian. Having been\r\npurchased of Count Fede by Pius VI, they were placed in the Museum of\r\nthe Vatican.\r\n\r\n  105. ANTINOÜS.\r\n\r\nThis bust is particularly deserving of attention, on account of its\r\nbeauty, its excellent preservation, and perfect resemblance to the\r\nmedals which remain of Adrian's favourite.\r\n\r\nIt is of Parian marble of the finest quality, and had been in France\r\nlong before the revolution.\r\n\r\n  112. ARIADNE, _called_ (in the catalogue) BACCHUS.\r\n\r\nSome sculptors have determined to call this beautiful head that of\r\nBACCHUS; while the celebrated VISCONTI, and other distinguished\r\nantiquaries, persist in preserving to it its ancient name of ARIADNE,\r\nby which it was known in the Museum of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nWhichever it may be, it is of Pentelic marble, and unquestionably one\r\nof the most sublime productions of the chisel, in point of _ideal_\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the HALL OF THE LAOCOON, we pass into the apartment, which, from\r\nthe famous statue, here erected, and embellished in the most splendid\r\nmanner, takes the appellation of the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE APOLLO.\r\n\r\nThis hall is ornamented with four pillars of red oriental granite of\r\nthe finest quality: those which decorate the niche of the Apollo were\r\ntaken from the church that contained the tomb of Charlemagne at\r\n_Aix-la-Chapelle_. The floor is paved with different species of\r\nscarce and valuable marble, in large compartments, and, in its\r\ncentre, is placed a large octagonal table of the same substance.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the dimensions of this apartment, which is\r\nconsiderably larger than any of the others, a greater number of\r\nantiques are here placed, of which the following are the most\r\npre-eminent.\r\n\r\n  N° 145. APOLLO PYTHIUS, _commonly called the_ APOLLO OF BELVEDERE.\r\n\r\nThe name alone of this _chef d'oeuvre_ might be said to contain its\r\neulogium. But as you may, probably, expect from me some remarks on\r\nit, I shall candidly acknowledge that I can do no better than\r\ncommunicate to you the able and interesting description given of it\r\nby the Administration of the Museum, of which the following is a fair\r\nabridgment.\r\n\r\n\"Apollo has just discharged the mortal arrow which has struck the\r\nserpent Python, while ravaging Delphi. In his left hand is held his\r\nformidable bow; his right has but an instant quitted it: all his\r\nmembers still preserve the impression given them by this action.\r\nIndignation is seated on his lips; but in his looks is the assurance\r\nof success. His hair, slightly curled, floats in long ringlets round\r\nhis neck, or is gracefully turned up on the crown of his head, which\r\nis encircled by the _strophium_, or fillet, characteristic of kings\r\nand gods. His quiver is suspended by a belt to the right shoulder:\r\nhis feet are adorned with rich sandals. His _chlamis_ fastened on the\r\nshoulder, and tucked up only on the left arm, is thrown back, as if\r\nto display the majesty of his divine form to greater advantage.\r\n\r\n\"An eternal youth is spread over all his beautiful figure, a sublime\r\nmixture of nobleness and agility, of vigour and elegance, and which\r\nholds a happy medium between the delicate form of Bacchus, and the\r\nmore manly one of Mercury.\"\r\n\r\nThis inimitable master-piece is of Carrara marble, and, consequently,\r\nwas executed by some Greek artist who lived in the time of the\r\nRomans; but the name of its author is entirely unknown. The fore-arm\r\nand the left hand, which were wanting, were restored by GIOVANNI\r\nANGELO DE MONTORSOLI, a sculptor, who was a pupil of Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century, it was discovered at _Capo\r\nd'Anzo_, twelve leagues from Rome, on the sea-shore, near the ruins\r\nof the ancient _Antium_. Julius II, when cardinal, purchased this\r\nstatue, and placed it in his palace; but shortly after, having\r\narrived at the pontificate, he had it conveyed to the Belvedere of\r\nthe Vatican, where, for three centuries, it was the admiration of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of Brumaire, year IX, (7th of November, 1801) BONAPARTE,\r\nas First Consul, celebrated, in great pomp, the inauguration of the\r\nApollo; on which occasion he placed between the plinth of the statue,\r\nand its pedestal, a brass tablet bearing a suitable inscription.\r\n\r\nThe Apollo stands facing the entrance-door of the apartment, in an\r\nelevated recess, decorated, as I have before observed, with beautiful\r\ngranite pillars. The flight of steps, leading to this recess, is\r\npaved with the rarest marble, inlaid with squares of curious antique\r\nmosaic, and on them are placed two Egyptian sphynxes of red oriental\r\ngranite, taken from the Museum of the Vatican.\r\n\r\n  142. VENUS OF THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nThis figure of Parian marble represents the goddess of beauty issuing\r\nfrom the bath. Her charms are not concealed by any veil or garment.\r\nShe is slightly turning her head to the left, as if to smile on the\r\nGraces, who are supposed to be preparing to attire her.\r\n\r\nIn point of execution, this is allowed to be the most beautiful of\r\nall the statues of Venus which we have remaining. The _Venus of\r\nMedicis_ surpasses it in sublimity of form, approaching nearer to\r\n_ideal_ beauty.\r\n\r\nBupalus, a sculptor of the Isle of Scio, is said to have produced\r\nthis master-piece. He lived 600 years before Christ, so that it has\r\nnow been in existence upwards of two thousand four hundred years. It\r\nwas found about the middle of the eighteenth century, near\r\n_San-Vitale_, at Rome. Benedict XIV having purchased it of the\r\n_Stati_ family, placed it in the Capitol.\r\n\r\n  125. MERCURY, _commonly called the_ ANTINOÜS OF BELVEDERE.\r\n\r\nThis statue, also of the finest Parian marble, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful that can be imagined. More robust in form than either that\r\nof the _Apollo_ or of the _Meleager_, it loses nothing by being\r\ncontemplated after the former. In short, the harmony which reigns\r\nbetween its parts is such, that the celebrated POUSSIN, in preference\r\nto every other, always took from it the _proportions of the human\r\nfigure_.\r\n\r\nIt was found at Rome, on Mount Esquiline, under the pontificate of\r\nPaul III, who placed it in the Belvedere of the Vatican, near the\r\nApollo and the Laocoon.\r\n\r\n  151. _The Egyptian_ ANTINOÜS.\r\n\r\nIn this statue, Antinoüs is represented as a divinity of Egypt. He is\r\nstanding in the usual attitude of the Egyptian gods, and is naked,\r\nwith the exception of his head and wrist, which are covered with a\r\nspecies of drapery in imitation of the sacred garments.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful figure is wrought with superior excellence. It is of\r\nwhite marble, which leads to a conjecture that it might have been\r\nintended to represent Orus, the god of light, it having been the\r\ncustom of the Egyptians to represent all their other divinities in\r\ncoloured marble. It was discovered in 1738, at Tivoli, in the\r\n_Villa-Adriana_, and taken from the Museum of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the great number of figures of Antinoüs, sculptured by\r\norder of Adrian to perpetuate the memory of that favourite, the\r\nemperor's gratitude for him must have been unbounded. Under the form\r\nof different divinities, or at different periods of life, there are\r\nat present in the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES no less than five portraits of\r\nhim, besides three statues and two busts. Three other statues of\r\nAntinoüs, together with a bust, and an excellent bass-relief, in\r\nwhich he is represented, yet remain to be placed.\r\n\r\n  156. BACCHUS.\r\n\r\nThe god of wine is here represented standing, and entirely naked. He\r\nis leaning carelessly with his left arm on the trunk of an elm, round\r\nwhich winds a grape-vine.\r\n\r\nThis statue, of the marble called at Rome _Greco duro_, is reckoned\r\none of the finest extant of the mirth-inspiring deity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving surveyed every object deserving of notice in the HALL OF THE\r\nAPOLLO, we proceed, on the right hand, towards its extremity, and\r\nreach the last apartment of the gallery, which, from being\r\nconsecrated to the tuneful Nine, is called the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE MUSES.\r\n\r\nIt is paved with curious marble, and independently of the Muses, and\r\ntheir leader, Apollo, here are also assembled the antique portraits\r\nof poets and philosophers who have rendered themselves famous by\r\ncultivating them. Among these we may perceive HOMER and VIRGIL; but\r\nthe most remarkable specimen of the art is\r\n\r\n  N° 177. EURIPIDES.\r\n\r\nIn this hermes we have a capital representation of the features of\r\nthe rival of Sophocles. The countenance is at once noble, serious,\r\nand expressive. It bears the stamp of the genius of that celebrated\r\ntragic poet, which was naturally sublime and profound, though\r\ninclined to the pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis hermes is executed in Pentelic marble, and was taken from the\r\nacademy of _Mantua_.\r\n\r\nSince the revival of the arts, the lovers of antiquity have made\r\nrepeated attempts to form a collection of antique statues of the\r\nMuses; but none was ever so complete as that assembled in the Museum\r\nof the Vatican by Pius VI, and which the chance of war has now\r\ntransferred to the banks of the Seine. Here the bard may offer up to\r\nthem a solemn invocation, and compose his lay, as it were, under\r\ntheir very eyes.\r\n\r\nThe statues of CLIO, THALIA, TERPSICHORE, ERATO, POLYHYMNIA, and\r\nCALLIOPE, together with the APOLLO MUSAGETES, were discovered in\r\n1774, at _Tivoli_, among the ruins of the villa of Cassius. To\r\ncomplete the number, Pius VI obtained the EUTERPE and the URANIA from\r\nthe _Lancellotti_ palace at _Veletri_. They are supposed to be\r\nantique copies of the statues of the Nine Muses by Philiscus, which,\r\naccording to Pliny, graced the portico of Octavia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe air of grandeur that reigns in the general arrangement of the\r\ngallery is very striking: and the tasteful and judicious distribution\r\nof this matchless assemblage of antiques does great honour to the\r\nCouncil of the CENTRAL MUSEUM. Among the riches which Rome possessed,\r\nthe French commissioners also, by their choice selection, have\r\nmanifested the depth of their knowledge, and the justness of their\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nThe alterations and embellishments made in the different apartments\r\nof the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES have been executed under the immediate\r\ndirection of their author, M. RAYMOND, member of the National\r\nInstitute, and architect to the NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.\r\nIn winter, the apartments are kept warm by means of flues, which\r\ndiffuse a genial vapour. Here, without the expense of a single\r\n_liard_, the young draughtsman may form his taste by studying the\r\ntrue antique models of Grecian sculpture; the more experienced artist\r\nmay consult them as he finds occasion in the composition of his\r\nsubjects; while the connoisseur, the amateur, or the simple observer\r\nmay spend many an agreeable hour in contemplating these master-pieces\r\nwhich, for centuries, have inspired universal admiration.\r\n\r\nThese are the materials on which Genius ought to work, and without\r\nwhich the most promising talent may be greatly misapplied, if not\r\nentirely lost. It was by studying closely these correct models, that\r\nthe great MICHAEL ANGELO, the, sublime RAPHAEL, and other eminent\r\nmasters, acquired that idea of excellence which is the result of the\r\naccumulated experience of successive ages. Here, in one visit, the\r\nstudent may imbibe those principles to ascertain which many artists\r\nhave consumed the best part of their days; and penetrated by their\r\neffect, he is spared the laborious investigation by which they came\r\nto be known and established. It is unnecessary to expatiate on the\r\nadvantages which the fine arts may expect to derive from such a\r\nrepository of antiques in a capital so centrical as Paris. The\r\ncontemplation of them cannot fail to fire the genius of any artist of\r\ntaste, and prompt his efforts towards the attainment of that grand\r\nstyle, which, disdaining the minute accidental particularities of\r\nindividual objects, improves partial representation by the general\r\nand invariable ideas of nature.\r\n\r\nA vast collection of antiquities of every description is still\r\nexpected from Italy, among which are the _Venus of Medicis_ and the\r\n_Pallas of Veletri_, a finely-preserved statue, classed by artists\r\namong those of the first rank, dug up at _Veletri_ in 1799, in\r\nconsequence of the researches made there by order of the French\r\ncommissioners. Upwards of five hundred cases were lying on the banks\r\nof the Tiber, at Rome, ready to be sent off to France, when the\r\nNeapolitans entered that city. They carried them all away: but by the\r\nlast article of the treaty of peace with the king of Naples, the\r\nwhole of them are to be restored to the French Republic. For the\r\npurpose of verifying their condition, and taking measures for their\r\nconveyance to Paris, two commissioners have been dispatched to Italy:\r\none is the son of CHAPTAL, Minister of the Interior, and the other is\r\nDUFOURNY, the architect. On the arrival of these cases, even after\r\nthe fifteen departmental Museums have been supplied, it is asserted\r\nthat there will yet remain in the French capital, antiquities in\r\nsufficient number to form a museum almost from Paris to Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS is open to the public in general on\r\nthe 8th, 9th, and 10th of each decade;[1] the other days are\r\nappropriated to the study of young pupils; but a foreigner has only\r\nto produce his _permis de séjour_ to gain admission _gratis_ every\r\nday from the hour of ten o'clock to four. To the credit of the\r\nnation, I must observe that this exception in favour of foreigners\r\nexcites no jealousy whatever.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than a justice due to the liberality of the French\r\nrepublican government to add, that they set a noble example which is\r\nworthy of being followed, not only in England, but in every other\r\ncountry, where the arts and sciences are honoured, or the general\r\ninterests of mankind held in estimation. From persons visiting any\r\nnational establishment, whether museum, library, cabinet, or garden,\r\nin this capital, no sort of fee or perquisite is now expected, or\r\nallowed to be taken. Although it was not a public day when I paid my\r\nfirst visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM, no sooner did I shew my _permis de\r\nséjour_, than the doors were thrown open; and from M. VISCONTI, and\r\nother members of the Council, who happened to be present, I\r\nexperienced the most polite and obliging attention. As an Englishman,\r\nI confess that I felt a degree of shame on reflecting to what pitiful\r\nexaction a foreigner would be subject, who might casually visit any\r\npublic object of curiosity in our metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By a subsequent regulation, Saturday and Sunday are the\r\ndays on which the CENTRAL MUSEUM is open to public inspection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 31, 1801._\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question, I shall begin by informing you that I\r\nhave not set eyes on the _petit caporal_, as some affect to style the\r\nChief Consul. He spends much of his time, I am told, at _Malmaison_,\r\nhis country-seat; and seldom appears in public, except in his box at\r\nthe Opera, or at the French theatre; but at the grand monthly parade,\r\nI shall be certain to behold him, on the 15th of the present month of\r\nBrumaire, according to the republican calendar, which day answers to\r\nthe 6th of November. I have therefore to check my impatience for a\r\nweek longer.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I have not yet seen BONAPARTE himself, I have at least\r\nseen a person who has seen him, and will take care that I shall have\r\nan opportunity of seeing him too: this person is no less than a\r\ngeneral--who accompanied him in his expedition to Egypt--who was\r\namong the chosen few that returned with him from that country--who\r\nthere surveyed the mouths of the Nile--who served under him in the\r\nfamous campaign of Syria; and who at this day is one of the first\r\nmilitary engineers in Europe. In a word, it is General A----y, of the\r\nartillery, at present Director of that scientific establishment,\r\ncalled the DÉPÔT DE LA GUERRE. He invited me the day before yesterday\r\nto breakfast, with a view of meeting some of his friends whom he had\r\npurposely assembled.\r\n\r\nI am not fond of breakfasting from home; _mais il faut vivre à Rome\r\ncomme à Rome_. Between ten and eleven o'clock I reached the _Dépôt_,\r\nwhich is situated in the _Rue de l'Université_, _Faubourg St,\r\nGermain_, at the _ci-devant Hôtel d'Harcourt_, formerly belonging to\r\nthe duke of that name. Passing through the gate-way, I was proceeding\r\nboldly to the principal entrance of the hotel, when a sentinel\r\nstopped me short by charging his bayonet. \"Citizen,\" said he\r\nfiercely, at the same time pointing to the lodge on the right, \"you\r\nmust speak to the porter.\" I accordingly obeyed the mandate. \"What's\r\nyour business, citizen?\" inquired the porter gruffly.--\"My business,\r\ncitizen,\" replied I, \"is only to breakfast with the general.\"--\"Be so\r\ngood, citizen,\" rejoined he in a milder tone, \"as to take the trouble\r\nto ascend the grand stair-case, and ring the bell on the\r\nfirst-floor.\"\r\n\r\nBeing introduced into the general's apartments, I there found eight\r\nor ten persons of very intelligent aspect, seated at a round table,\r\nloaded with all sorts of good things, but, in my mind, better\r\ncalculated for dinner than breakfast. Among a great variety of\r\ndelicacies, were beef-steaks, or, as they are here termed, _bif-ticks\r\nà l'Anglaise_. Oysters too were not forgotten: indeed, they compose\r\nan essential part of a French breakfast; and the ladies seem\r\nparticularly partial to them, I suppose, because they are esteemed\r\nstrengthening to a delicate constitution.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more pleasant than this party. Most of the guests\r\nwere distinguished literati, or military men of no ordinary stamp.\r\nOne of the latter, a _chef de brigade_ of engineers, near whom I\r\nconsidered myself fortunate in being placed, spoke to me in the\r\nhighest terms of Mr. SPENCER SMITH, Sir Sidney's brother, to whose\r\ninterference at _Constantinople_, he was indebted for his release\r\nfrom a Turkish prison.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the continual clatter of knives and forks, and the\r\noccasional gingle of glasses, the conversation, which suffered no\r\ninterruption, was to me extremely interesting: I never heard any men\r\nexpress opinions more liberal on every subject that was started. It\r\nwas particularly gratifying to my feelings, as an Englishman, to hear\r\na set of French gentlemen, some of whom had participated in the sort\r\nof disgrace attached to the raising of the siege of _St. Jean\r\nd'Acre_, generously bestow just encomiums on my brother-officer, to\r\nwhose heroism they owed their failure. Addison, I think, says,\r\nsomewhere in the Spectator, that national prejudice is a laudable\r\npartiality; but, however laudable it may be to indulge such a\r\npartiality, it ought not to render us blind to the merit of\r\nindividuals of a rival nation.\r\n\r\nGeneral A----y, being one of those whose talents have been found too\r\nuseful to the State to be suffered to remain in inaction, was obliged\r\nto attend at the _Conseil des Mines_ soon after twelve o'clock, when\r\nthe party separated. Just as I was taking leave, he did me the favour\r\nto put into my hand a copy of his _Histoire du Canal du Midi_, of\r\nwhich I shall say more when I have had leisure to peruse it.\r\n\r\nI do not know that a man in good health, who takes regular exercise,\r\nis the worse for breakfasting on a beef-steak, in the long-exploded\r\nstyle of Queen Bess; but I am no advocate for all the accessories of\r\na French _déjeûner à la fourchette_. The strong Mocha coffee which I\r\nswallowed, could not check the more powerful effect of the Madeira\r\nand _crème de rose_. I therefore determined on taking a long walk,\r\nwhich, when saddle-horses are not to be procured, I have always found\r\nthe best remedy for the kind of restlessness created by such a\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nI accordingly directed my steps across the _Pont & Place de la\r\nConcorde_, traversed the street of the same name; and, following the\r\n_Boulevard_ for a certain distance, struck off to the left, that is,\r\ntowards the north, in order to gain the summit of\r\n\r\nMONTMARTRE.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, there stood on this hill a temple dedicated to\r\nMars, whence the name _Mons Martis_, of which has been made\r\n_Montmartre_. At the foot of it, was the _Campus Martius_, or _Champ\r\nde Mars_, where the French kings of the first race caused their\r\nthrone to be erected every year on the first of May. They came hither\r\nin a car, decorated with green boughs and flowers, and drawn by four\r\noxen. Such, indeed, was the town-equipage of king DAGOBERT.\r\n\r\n  \"Quatre boeufs attelés, d'un pas tranquil et lent,\r\n  Promenaient dans Paris le monarque indolent.\"\r\n\r\nHaving seated themselves on the throne, they gave a public audience\r\nto the people, at the same time giving and receiving presents, which\r\nwere called _estrennes_. Hence annual presents were afterwards termed\r\n_étrennes_, and this gave rise to the custom of making them.\r\n\r\nOn this hill too fell the head of [Greek: Dionusios] or _St. Denis_;\r\nand in latter times, this was the spot chosen by the Marshal DE\r\nBROGLIE, who commanded the thirty-five thousand troops by which the\r\nFrench capital was surrounded in May 1789, for checking the spirit of\r\nthe turbulent Parisians, by battering their houses' about their ears,\r\nand burying them under the ruins.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of _Montmartre_, is a circular terrace, in the centre\r\nof which stands a windmill, and not far from it, are several others.\r\nRound its brow are several _maisonettes_, or little country boxes,\r\nand also some public gardens with bowers, where lovers often regale\r\ntheir mistresses. Hence you command a full view of the city of Paris.\r\nYou behold roof rising above roof; and the churches towering above\r\nthe houses have, at this distance, somewhat the appearance of lofty\r\nchimnies. You look down on the capital as far as the Seine, by which\r\nit is intersected: beyond that river, the surface of the land rises\r\nagain in the form of an amphitheatre. On all sides, the prospect is\r\nbounded by eminences of various degrees of elevation, over which, as\r\nwell as over the plains, and along the banks of the river, are\r\nscattered villas, windmills, country-seats, hamlets, villages, and\r\ncoppices; but, from want of enclosures, the circumjacent country has\r\nnot that rich and variegated aspect which delights the eye in our\r\nEnglish rural scenery. This was always one of my favourite walks\r\nduring my residence in Paris before the revolution; and I doubt not,\r\nwhen you visit the French capital, that you will have the curiosity\r\nto scale the heights of _Montmartre_.\r\n\r\nAs to the theatres, concerning which you interrogate me, I shall\r\ndefer entering into any particular detail of them, till I have made\r\nmyself fully acquainted with the attractions of each: this mode of\r\nproceeding will not occasion any material delay, as I generally visit\r\none of them every evening, but always endeavour to go to that house\r\nwhere the _best_ performers are to be seen, in their _best_\r\ncharacters, and in the _best_ pieces. I mention this, in order that\r\nyou may not think me inattentive to your request, by having hitherto\r\nomitted to point out to you the difference between the theatrical\r\namusements here under the monarchy, and those of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe _thèâtre des arts_ or grand French opera, the _opera buffa_ or\r\nItalian comic opera, the _théâtre Feydeau_ or French comic opera, and\r\nthe _théâtre Français_, chiefly engage my attention. Yesterday\r\nevening I went to the last-mentioned theatre purposely to see\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT, who played in both pieces. The first was _Les\r\nFemmes Savantes_, a comedy, in which Molière, wishing to aim a blow\r\nat female pedantry, has, perhaps, checked, in some French women, a\r\ndesire for improvement; the second was _La fausse Agnès_, a laughable\r\nafterpiece. Notwithstanding the enormous _embonpoint_ which this\r\ncelebrated comic actress has acquired since I saw her last on the\r\nParisian stage upwards of ten years ago, she acquitted herself with\r\nher accustomed excellence. I happened to sit next to a very warm\r\nadmirer of her superior talents, who told me that, bulky as she was\r\nbecome, he had been highly gratified in seeing her perform at _Rouen_\r\nnot long since, in her favourite character of _Roxalane_, in _Les\r\nTrois Sultanes_. \"She was much applauded, no doubt.\" observed I.\r\n--\"Not at all,\" replied he, \"for the crowd was so great, that in no\r\npart of the house was it possible for a man to use his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 2, 1801._\r\n\r\nOn reaching Paris, every person, whether Jew or Gentile, foreigner or\r\nnot, coming from any department of the republic, except that of _La\r\nSeine_, in which the capital is situated, is now bound to make his\r\nappearance at the _Préfecture de Police_.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer, accompanied by two housekeepers, first repairs to the\r\nPolice-office of the _arrondissement_, or district, in which he has\r\ntaken up his residence, where he delivers his travelling passport; in\r\nlieu of which he receives a sort of certificate, and then he shews\r\nhimself at the _Préfecture de Police_, or General Police-office, at\r\npresent established in the _Cité_.\r\n\r\nHere, his name and quality, together with a minute description of his\r\nperson and his place of abode, are inserted in a register kept for\r\nthat purpose, to which he puts his signature; and a printed paper,\r\ncommonly called a _permis de séjour_, is given to him, containing a\r\nduplicate of all these matters, filled up in the blanks, which he\r\nalso signs himself. It is intended that he should always carry this\r\npaper about him, in order that he may produce it when called on, or,\r\nin case of necessity, for verifying his person, on any particular\r\noccasion, such as passing by a guard-house on foot after eleven\r\no'clock at night, or being unexpectedly involved in any affray. In a\r\nword, it answers to a stranger the same end as a _carte de sureté_,\r\nor ticket of safety, does to an inhabitant of Paris.\r\n\r\nI accordingly went through this indispensable ceremony in due form on\r\nmy arrival here; but, having neglected to read a _nota bene_ in the\r\nmargin of the _permis de séjour_, I had not been ten hours in my new\r\napartments before I received a visit from an Inspector of Police of\r\nthe _arrondissement_, who, very civilly reminding me of the omission,\r\ntold me that I need not give myself the trouble of going to the\r\nCentral Police-office, as he would report my removal. However, being\r\ndetermined to be strictly _en règle_, I went thither myself to cause\r\nmy new residence to be inserted in the paper.\r\n\r\nI should not have dwelt on the circumstance, were it not to shew you\r\nthe precision observed in the administration of the police of this\r\ngreat city.\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_, every master of a ready-furnished hotel was\r\nobliged to keep a register, in which he inserted the name and quality\r\nof his lodgers for the inspection of the police-officers whenever\r\nthey came: this regulation is not only strictly adhered to at\r\npresent; but every person in Paris, who receives a stranger under his\r\nroof as an inmate, is bound, under penalty of a fine, to report him\r\nto the police, which is most vigilantly administered by Citizen\r\nFOUCHÉ.\r\n\r\nLast night, not being in time to find good places at the _Théâtre des\r\nArts_, or Grand French Opera, I went to the _Théâtre Louvois_, which\r\nis within a few paces of it, in hopes of being more successful. I\r\nshall not at present attempt to describe the house, as, from my\r\narriving late, I was too ill accommodated to be able to view it to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was well seated for seeing the performance. It consisted\r\nof three _petites pièces_: namely, _Une heure d'absence_, _La petite\r\nville_, and _Le café d'une petite ville_. The first was entertaining;\r\nbut the second much more so; and though the third cannot claim the\r\nmerit of being well put together, I shall say a few words of it, as\r\nit is a production _in honour of peace_, and on that score alone,\r\nwould, at this juncture, deserve notice.\r\n\r\nAfter a few scenes somewhat languid, interspersed with common-place,\r\nand speeches of no great humour, a _dénouement_, by no means\r\ninteresting, promised not to compensate the audience for their\r\npatience. But the author of the _Café d'une petite ville_, having\r\neased himself of this burden, revealed his motive, and took them on\r\ntheir weak side, by making a strong appeal to French enthusiasm. This\r\ncord being adroitly struck, his warmth became communicative, and\r\nanimating the actors, good humor did the rest. The accessories were\r\ninfinitely more interesting than the main subject. An allemande,\r\ngracefully danced by two damsels and a hero, in the character of a\r\nFrench hussar, returned home from the fatigues of war and battle, was\r\nmuch applauded; and a Gascoon poet, who declares that, for once in\r\nhis life, he is resolved to speak truth, was loudly encored in the\r\nfollowing couplets, adapted to the well-known air of _\"Gai, le coeur\r\nà la danse.\"_\r\n\r\n  \"Celui qui nous donne la paix,\r\n  Comme il fit bien la guerre!\r\n  Sur lui déjà force conplets....\r\n  Mai il en reste à faire:\r\n  Au diable nous nous donnions,\r\n  Il revient, nous respirons....\r\n  Il fait changer la danse;\r\n\r\n  Par lui chez nous plus de discord;\r\n  Il regle la cadence,\r\n  Et nous voilà d'accord.\"\r\n\r\nTrue it is, that BONAPARTE, as principal ballet-master, has changed\r\nthe dance of the whole nation; he regulates their step to the measure\r\nof his own music, and _discord_ is mute at the moment: but the\r\nquestion is, whether the French are bona-fide _d'accord_, (as the\r\nGascoon affirms,) that is, perfectly reconciled to the new tune and\r\nfigure? Let us, however, keep out of this maze; were we to enter it,\r\nwe might remain bewildered there, perhaps, till old Father Time came\r\nto extricate us.\r\n\r\nThe morning is inviting: suppose we take a turn in the _Tuileries_,\r\nnot with a view of surveying this garden, but merely to breathe the\r\nfresh air, and examine the\r\n\r\nPALAIS DU GOUVERNEMENT.\r\n\r\nSince the Chief Consul has made it his town-residence, this is the\r\nnew denomination given to the _Palais des Tuileries_, thus called,\r\nbecause a tile-kiln formerly stood on the site where it is erected.\r\nAt that time, this part of Paris was not comprised within its walls,\r\nnothing was to be seen here, in the vicinity of the tile-kiln, but a\r\nfew coppices and scattered habitations.\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medicis, wishing to enlarge the capital on this side,\r\nvisited the spot, and liking the situation, directed PHILIBERT DE\r\nL'ORME and JEAN BULLAN, two celebrated French architects, to present\r\nher with a plan, from which the construction of this palace was begun\r\nin May 1564. At first, it consisted only of the large square pavilion\r\nin the centre of the two piles of building, which have each a terrace\r\ntowards the garden, and of the two pavilions by which they are\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nHenry IV enlarged the original building, and, in 1600, began the\r\ngrand gallery which joins it to the _Louvre_, from the plan of DU\r\nCERCEAU. Lewis XIII made some alterations in the palace; and in 1664,\r\nexactly a century from the date of its construction being begun,\r\nLewis XIV directed LOUIS DE VEAU to finish it, by making the\r\nadditions and embellishments which have brought it to its present\r\nstate. These deviations from the first plan have destroyed the\r\nproportions required by the strict rules of art; but this defect\r\nwould, probably, be overlooked by those who are not connoisseurs, as\r\nthe architecture, though variously blended, presents, at first sight,\r\nan _ensemble_ which is magnificent and striking.\r\n\r\nThe whole front of the palace of the _Tuileries_ consists of five\r\npavilions, connected by four piles of building, standing on the same\r\nline, and extending for the space of one thousand and eleven feet.\r\nThe first order of the three middle piles is Ionic, with encircled\r\ncolumns. The two adjoining pavilions are also ornamented with Ionic\r\npillars; but fluted, and embellished with foliage, from the third of\r\ntheir height to the summit. The second order of these two pavilions\r\nis Corinthian. The two piles of building, which come next, as well as\r\nthe two pavilions of the wings, are of a Composite order with fluted\r\npillars. From a tall iron spindle, placed on the pinnacle of each of\r\nthe three principal pavilions is now seen floating a horizontal\r\ntri-coloured streamer. Till the improvements made by Lewis XIV, the\r\nlarge centre pavilion had been decorated with the Ionic and Corinthian\r\norders only, to these was added the Composite.\r\n\r\nOn the façade towards the _Place du Carrousel_, the pillars of all\r\nthese orders are of brown and red marble. Here may be observed the\r\nmarks of several cannon-balls, beneath each of which is inscribed, in\r\nblack, 10 AOÛT.\r\n\r\nThis tenth of August 1792, a day ever memorable in the history of\r\nFrance, has furnished many an able writer with the subject of an\r\nepisode; but, I believe, few of them were, any more than myself,\r\nactors in that dreadful scene. While I was intently remarking the\r\nparticular impression of a shot which struck the edge of one of the\r\ncasements of the first floor of the palace, my _valet de place_ came\r\nup to know at which door I would have the carriage remain in waiting.\r\n\r\nOn turning round, I fancied I beheld the man who \"drew Priam's\r\ncurtain in the dead of night.\" That messenger, I am sure, could not\r\nhave presented a visage more pale, more spiritless than my Helvetian.\r\nRecollecting that he had served in the Swiss guards, I was the less\r\nat a loss to account for his extreme agitation. \"In what part of the\r\n_château_ were you, Jean,\" said I, \"when these balls were aimed at\r\nthe windows?\"----\"There was my post,\" replied he, recovering himself,\r\nand pointing to one of the centre casements.--\"Is it true,\" continued\r\nI, \"that, by way of feigning a reconciliation, you threw down\r\ncartridges by handfuls to the Marseillese below, and called out;\r\n_vive la nation?\"_----\"It is but too true,\" answered Jean; \"we then\r\navailed ourselves of the moment when they advanced under the\r\npersuasion that they were to become our friends, and opened on them a\r\ntremendous fire, by which we covered the place with dead and dying.\r\nBut we became victims of our own treachery: for our ammunition being,\r\nby this _ruse de guerre_, the sooner expended, we presently had no\r\nresource left but the bayonet, by which we could not prevent the mob\r\nfrom closing on us.\"--\"And how did you contrive to escape,\" said I?\r\n--\"Having thrown away my Swiss uniform,\" replied he, \"in the general\r\nconfusion, I fortunately possessed myself of the coat of a national\r\nvolunteer, which he had taken off on account of the hot weather. This\r\ngarment, bespattered with blood, I instantly put on, as well as his\r\nhat with a tri-coloured cockade.\"--\"This disguise saved your life,\"\r\ninterrupted I.--\"Yes, indeed;\" rejoined he. \"Having got down to the\r\nvestibule, I could not find a passage into the garden; and, to\r\nprevent suspicion, I at once mixed with the mob on the place where we\r\nare now standing.\"--\"How did you get off at last,\" said I?--\"I was\r\nobliged,\" answered he, \"to shout and swear with the _poissardes_,\r\nwhile the heads of many of my comrades were thrown out of the\r\nwindows.\"--\"The _poissardes_,\" added I, \"set no bounds to their\r\ncruelty?\"--\"No,\" replied he, \"I expected every moment to feel its\r\neffects; my disguise alone favoured my escape: on the dead bodies of\r\nmy countrymen they practised every species of mutilation.\" Here Jean\r\ndrew a picture of a nature too horrid to be committed to paper. My\r\npen could not trace it.----In a word, nothing could exceed the\r\nferocity of the infuriate populace; and the sacking of the palace of\r\nthe Trojan king presents but a faint image of what passed here on the\r\nday which overset the throne of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nAccording to a calculation, founded as well on the reports of the\r\npolice as on the returns of the military corps, it appears that the\r\nnumber of men killed in the attack of the palace of the _Tuileries_\r\non the 10th of August 1792, amounted in the whole to very near six\r\nthousand, of whom eight hundred and fifty-two were on the side of the\r\nbesieged, and three thousand seven hundred and forty on the side of\r\nthe besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this palace is not distinguished by any particular\r\nstyle of architecture, the kings who have resided here having made\r\nsuch frequent alterations, that the distribution throughout is very\r\ndifferent from that which was at first intended. Here it was that\r\nCatherine de Medicis shut herself up with the Guises, the Gondis, and\r\nBirague, the chancellor, in order to plan the horrible massacre of\r\nthat portion of the French nation whose religious tenets trenched on\r\npapal power, and whose spirit of independence alarmed regal jealousy.\r\n\r\nAmong the series of entertainments, given on the marriage of the king\r\nof Navarre with Marguerite de Valois, was introduced a ballet, in\r\nwhich the papists, commanded by Charles IX and his brothers, defended\r\nparadise against the huguenots, who, with Navarre at their head, were\r\nall repulsed and driven into hell. Although this pantomime, solely\r\ninvented by Catherine, was evidently meant as a prelude to the\r\ndreadful proscription which awaited the protestants, they had no\r\nsuspicion of it; and four days after, was consummated the massacre,\r\nwhere that monster to whom nature had given the form of a woman,\r\nfeasted her eyes on the mangled corpses of thousands of bleeding\r\nvictims!\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Pope informed of the horrors of St. Bartholemew's\r\nday; by the receipt of Admiral de Coligny's head which Catherine\r\nembalmed and sent to him, than he ordered a solemn procession, by way\r\nof returning thanks to heaven for the _happy event_. The account of\r\nthis procession so exasperated a gentlemen of Anjou, a protestant of\r\nthe name of Bressaut de la Rouvraye, that he swore he would make\r\neunuchs of all the monks who should fall into his hands; and he\r\nrendered himself famous by keeping his word, and wearing the trophies\r\nof his victory.\r\n\r\nThe _Louvre_ and the palace of the _Tuileries_ were alternately the\r\nresidence of the kings of France, till Lewis XIV built that of\r\nVersailles, after which it was deserted till the minority of Lewis\r\nXV, who, when a little boy, was visited here by Peter the Great, but,\r\nin 1722, the court quitted Paris altogether for Versailles, where it\r\ncontinued fixed till the 5th of October 1789.\r\n\r\nDuring this long interval, the palace was left under the direction of\r\na governor, and inhabited only by himself, and persons of various\r\nranks dependent on the bounty of the crown. When Lewis XVI and his\r\nfamily were brought hither at that period, the two wings alone were\r\nin proper order; the remainder consisted of spacious apartments\r\nappointed for the king's reception when he came occasionally to\r\nParis, and ornamented with stately, old-fashioned furniture, which\r\nhad not been deranged for years. The first night of their arrival,\r\nthey slept in temporary beds, and on the king being solicited the\r\nnext day to choose his apartments, he replied: \"Let everyone shift\r\nfor himself; for my part, I am very well where I am.\" But this fit of\r\nill-humor being over, the king and queen visited every part of the\r\npalace, assigning particular rooms to each person of their suite, and\r\ngiving directions for sundry repairs and alterations.\r\n\r\nVersailles was unfurnished, and the vast quantity of furniture\r\ncollected in that palace, during three successive reigns, was\r\ntransported to the _Tuileries_ for their majesties' accommodation.\r\nThe king chose for himself three rooms on the ground-floor, on the\r\nside of the gallery to the right as you enter the vestibule from the\r\ngarden; on the entresol, he established his geographical study; and\r\non the first floor, his bed-chamber: the apartments of the queen and\r\nroyal family were adjoining to those of the king; and the attendants\r\nwere distributed over the palace to the number of between six and\r\nseven hundred persons.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the furniture, &c. in the palace of the\r\n_Tuileries_ was sold in the spring of 1793. The sale lasted six\r\nmonths, and, had it not been stopped, would have continued six months\r\nlonger. Some of the king's dress-suits which had cost twelve hundred\r\nlouis fetched no more than five. By the inventory taken immediately\r\nafter the 10th of August 1792, and laid before the Legislative\r\nAssembly, it appears that the moveables of every description\r\ncontained in this palace were valued at 12,540,158 livres (_circa_\r\n£522,560 sterling,) in which was included the amount of the thefts,\r\ncommitted on that day, estimated at 1,000,000 livres, and that of the\r\ndilapidations, at the like sum, making together about £84,000\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nWhen Catherine de Medicis inhabited the palace of the _Tuileries_, it\r\nwas connected to the _Louvre_ by a garden, in the middle of which was\r\na large pond, always well stocked with fish for the supply of the\r\nroyal table. Lewis XIV transformed this garden into a spacious square\r\nor _place_, where in the year 1662, he gave to the queen dowager and\r\nhis royal consort a magnificent fête, at which, were assembled\r\nprinces, lords, and knights, with their ladies, from every part of\r\nEurope. Hence the square was named\r\n\r\nPLACE DU CARROUSEL.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the revolution, the palace of the _Tuileries_, on this\r\nside, was defended by a wall, pierced by three gates opening into as\r\nmany courts, separated by little buildings, which, in part, served\r\nfor lodging a few troops and their horses. All these buildings are\r\ntaken down; the _Place du Carrousel_ is considerably enlarged by the\r\ndemolition of various circumjacent edifices; and the wall is replaced\r\nby a handsome iron railing, fixed on a parapet about four feet high.\r\nIn this railing are three gates, the centre one of which is\r\nsurmounted by cocks, holding in their beak a civic crown over the\r\nletters R. F. the initials of the words _République Française_. On\r\neach side of it are small lodges, built of stone; and at the entrance\r\nare constantly posted two _vedettes_, belonging to the\r\nhorse-grenadiers of the consular guard.\r\n\r\nOn the piers of the other two gates are placed the four famous horses\r\nof gilt bronze, brought from St. Mark's place at Venice, whither they\r\nhad been carried after the capture of Byzantium. These productions\r\nare generally ascribed to the celebrated Lysippus, who flourished in\r\nthe reign of Alexander the Great, about 325 years before the\r\nchristian era; though this opinion is questioned by some distguished\r\nantiquaries and artists. Whoever may be the sculptor, their destiny\r\nis of a nature to fix attention, as their removal has always been the\r\nconsequence of a political revolution. After, the conquest of Greece\r\nby the Romans, they were transported from Corinth to Rome, for the\r\npurpose of adorning the triumphal arch of Septimius Severus. Hence\r\nthey were removed to Byzantium, when that city became the seat of the\r\neastern empire. From Byzantium, they were conveyed to Venice, and\r\nfrom Venice they have at last reached Paris.\r\n\r\nAs on the plain of Pharsalia the fate of Rome was decided by Cæsar's\r\ntriumph over Pompey, so on the _Place du Carrousel_ the fate of\r\nFrance by the triumph of the Convention over Robespierre and his\r\nsatellites. Here, Henriot, one of his most devoted creatures, whom he\r\nhad raised to the situation of commandant general of the Parisian\r\nguard, after having been carried prisoner before the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety, then sitting in the palace of the _Tuileries_, was\r\nreleased by Coffinhal, the President of the Revolutionary Tribunal,\r\nwho suddenly made his appearance at the head of a large body of horse\r\nand foot, supported by four pieces of cannon served by gunners the\r\nmost devoted to Robespierre.\r\n\r\nIt was half past seven o'clock in the evening, where Coffinhal,\r\ndecorated with his municipal scarf, presented himself before the\r\nCommittee: all the members thought themselves lost, and their fright\r\ncommunicating to the very bosom of the Convention, there spread\r\nconfusion and terror. But Coffinhal's presence of mind was not equal\r\nto his courage: he availed himself only in part of his advantage.\r\nAfter having, without the slightest resistance, disarmed the guards\r\nattached to the Convention, he loosened the fettered hands of Henriot\r\nand his aides-de-camp, and conducted them straight to the _Maison\r\nCommune_.\r\n\r\nIt is an incontestable fact that had either Coffinhal or Henriot\r\nimitated the conduct of Cromwell in regard to the Levellers, and\r\nmarched at the head of their troops into the hall of the Convention,\r\nhe might have carried all before him, and Robespierre's tyranny would\r\nhave been henceforth established on a basis not to be shaken.\r\n\r\nBut, when Henriot soon after appeared on the _Place du Carrousel_,\r\nwith his staff and a number of followers, he in vain endeavoured by\r\nharanguing the people to stir them up to act against the Convention;\r\nhis voice was drowned in tumultuous clamours, and he was deserted by\r\nhis hitherto-faithful gunners. The Convention had had time to recover\r\nfrom their panic, and to enlighten the Sections. Henriot was outlawed\r\nby that assembly, and, totally disconcerted by this news, he fled for\r\nrefuge to the _Maison Commune_, where Robespierre and all his\r\naccomplices were soon surrounded, and fell into the hands of those\r\nwhom but an instant before, they had proscribed as conspirators\r\ndeserving of the most exemplary punishment.\r\n\r\nHenriot, confused and terrified, sought his safety in flight, and was\r\nstealing along one of the galleries of the _Maison Commune_ when he\r\nmet Coffinhal, who was also flying. At the sight of Henriot, who on\r\ncoming from the Committee, had pledged his life on the success of his\r\nmeasures, Coffinhal was unable to check his rage. \"Coward!\" said he\r\nto him, \"to this then has led your certain means of defence!\r\nScoundrel! you shall not escape the death you are endeavouring to\r\navoid!\" Saying these words, he seized Henriot by the middle, and\r\nthrew him out of a window of the second story of the _Maison\r\nCommune_. Henriot falling on the roof of a building in a narrow\r\nstreet adjoining, was not killed; but he had scarcely recovered\r\nhimself before he was recognized by some soldiers in quest of him: he\r\nthen crawled into a sewer, close to the spot where he had fallen;\r\nwhen a soldier thrusting his bayonet into the sewer, put out one of\r\nhis eyes, and forced him to surrender.\r\n\r\nThus, the destiny of France, as is seen, hung by the thread of the\r\nmoment. It will be recollected that Henriot had the arsenal at his\r\ndisposal; he commanded the Parisian guard, and six thousand men\r\nencamped on the _Plaine des Sablons_, close to the capital: in a\r\nword, all the springs of the public force were in his hands. Had he\r\nseized the critical minute, and attacked the Convention at the\r\ninstant of his release, the scene of the 10th of August would have\r\nbeen renewed, and the _Place du Carrousel_ again stained with the\r\nblood of thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 5, 1801._\r\n\r\nI rise much later to-day than usual, in consequence of not having\r\ngone to bed till near seven o'clock this morning. Happening to call\r\nyesterday on a French lady of my acquaintance, I perceived some\r\npreparations which announced that she expected company. She did not\r\nleave me long in suspense, but invited me to her party for that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThis good lady, who is no longer in the flower of her age, was still\r\nin bed, though it was four o'clock when I paid my visit. On\r\nexpressing my fears that she was indisposed, she assured me of the\r\ncontrary, at the same time adding that she seldom rose till five in\r\nthe afternoon, on account of her being under the necessity of keeping\r\nlate hours. I was so struck by the expression, that I did not\r\nhesitate to ask her what was the _necessity_ which compelled her to\r\nmake a practice of turning day into night? She very courteously gave\r\nme a complete solution of this enigma, of which the following is the\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\"During the reign of terror,\" said she, \"several of us _ci-devant\r\nnoblesse_ lost our nearest relatives, and with them our property,\r\nwhich was either confiscated, or put under sequestration, so that we\r\nwere absolutely threatened by famine. When the prisoners were\r\nmassacred in September 1792, I left nothing unattempted to save the\r\nlife of my uncle and grandfather, who were both in confinement in the\r\n_Abbaye_. All my efforts were unavailing. My interference served only\r\nto exasperate their murderers and contributed, I fear, to accelerate\r\ntheir death, which it was my misfortune to witness. Their inhuman\r\nbutchers, from whom I had patiently borne every species of insult,\r\nwent so far as to present to me, on the end of a pike, a human heart,\r\nwhich had the appearance of having been broiled on the embers,\r\nassuring me that, as it was the heart of my uncle, I might eat it\r\nwith safety.\"--Here an ejaculation, involuntarily escaping me,\r\ninterrupted her for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" continued she, \"I was so overwhelmed by a conflict of\r\nrage, despair, and grief, that I scarcely retained the use of my\r\nsenses. The excess of my horror deprived me of utterance.--What\r\nlittle I was able to save from the wreck of my fortune, not affording\r\nme sufficient means of subsistence, I was, however reluctantly, at\r\nlength compelled to adopt a plan of life, by which I saw other women,\r\nin my forlorn situation, support a decent appearance. I therefore\r\nhired suitable apartments, and twice in each decade, I receive\r\ncompany. On one of these two nights I give a ball and supper, and on\r\nthe other, under the name of _société_, I have cards only.\r\n\r\n\"Having a numerous circle of female acquaintance,\" concluded she, \"my\r\nballs are generally well attended: those who are not fond of dancing,\r\nplay at the _bouillotte_; and the card-money defrays the expenses of\r\nthe entertainment, leaving me a handsome profit. In short, these six\r\nparties, during the month, enable me to pay my rent, and produce me a\r\ntolerable pittance.\"\r\n\r\nThis meloncholy recital affected me so much, that, on its being\r\nterminated, I was unable to speak; but I have reason to think that a\r\nfavourable construction was put on my silence. A volume, of the size\r\nof a family bible, would not be sufficient to display half the\r\ncontrasts engendered by the revolution. Many a _Marquise_ has been\r\nobliged to turn sempstress, in order to gain a livelihood; but my\r\nfriend the _Comtesse_ had much ready wit, though no talents of that\r\ndescription. Having soothed her mind by venting a few imprecations\r\nagainst the murderers of her departed relatives, she informed me that\r\nher company began to assemble between the hours of eleven and twelve,\r\nand begged that I would not fail to come to her\r\n\r\nPRIVATE BALL.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o'clock, I accordingly went thither, as I had promised,\r\nwhen I found the rooms perfectly crowded. Among a number of very\r\nagreeable ladies, several were to be distinguished for the elegance\r\nof their figure, though there were no more than three remarkable for\r\nbeauty. These terrestrial divinities would not only have embarrassed\r\nthe Grand Signior for a preference, but even have distracted the\r\nchoice of the Idalian shepherd himself. The dancing was already begun\r\nto an excellent band of music, led by Citizen JULIEN, a mulatto,\r\nesteemed the first player of country-dances in Paris. Of the dancers,\r\nsome of the women really astonished me by the ease and gracefulness\r\nof their movements: steps, which are known to be the most difficult,\r\nseemed to cost them not the smallest exertion. Famous as they have\r\never been for dancing, they seem now, in Cibber's words, \"to outdo\r\ntheir usual outdoings.\"\r\n\r\nIn former times, an extraordinary degree of curiosity was excited by\r\nany female who excelled in this pleasing accomplishment. I remember\r\nto have read that Don Juan of Austria, governor of the Low Countries,\r\nset out post from Brussels, and came to Paris _incog._ on purpose to\r\nsee Marguerite de Valois dance at a dress-ball, this princess being\r\nreckoned, at that time, the best dancer in Europe. What then would be\r\nthe admiration of such an _amateur_, could he now behold the\r\nperfection attained here by some of the beauties of the present day?\r\n\r\nThe men, doubtless, determined to vie with the women, seemed to pride\r\nthemselves more on agility than grace, and, by attempting whatever\r\nrequired extraordinary effort, reminded me of _figurans_ on the\r\nstage, so much have the Parisian youth adopted a truly theatrical\r\nstyle of dancing.\r\n\r\nThe French country-dances (or cotilions, as we term them in England)\r\nand waltzes, which are as much in vogue here as in Germany, were\r\nregularly interchanged. However, the Parisians, in my opinion, cannot\r\ncome up to the Germans in this, their native dance. I should have\r\nwished to have had Lavater by my side, and heard his opinion of the\r\ncharacters of the different female waltzers. It is a very curious and\r\ninteresting spectacle to see one woman assume a languishing air,\r\nanother a vacant smile, a third an aspect of stoical indifference;\r\nwhile a fourth seems lost in a voluptuous trance, a fifth captivates\r\nby an amiable modesty, a sixth affects the cold insensibility of a\r\nstatue, and so on in ever-varying succession, though all turning to\r\nthe animating changes of the same lively waltz. In short I observed\r\nthat, in this species of dance, the eyes and feet of almost every\r\nwoman appeared to be constantly at variance.\r\n\r\nWithout assuming the part of a moralist, I cannot help thinking that\r\nWerter was not altogether in the wrong when he swore, that, were it\r\nto cost him his life, no woman on whom he had set his affections,\r\nshould ever waltz with any one but himself. I am not singular in this\r\nopinion; for I recollect to have met with the same ideas in a book\r\nwritten by M. JACOBI, I think, a German author.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the waltz, \"We either ought,\" says he, \"not to boast so\r\nmuch of the propriety of our manners, or else not suffer that our\r\nwives and daughters, in a complete delirium, softly pressed in the\r\narms of men, bosom to bosom, should thus be hurried away by the sound\r\nof intoxicating music. In this _whirligig_ dance, every one seems to\r\nforget the rules of decorum; and though an innocent, young creature,\r\nexposed in this manner, were to remain pure and spotless, can she,\r\nwithout horror, reflect that she becomes, the sport of the\r\nimagination of the licentious youths to whom she so abandons herself?\r\nIt were to be wished,\" adds he, \"that our damsels (I mean those who\r\npreserve any vestige of bashfulness), might, concealed in a private\r\ncorner, hear sometimes the conversation of those very men to whom\r\nthey yield themselves with so little reserve and caution.\"\r\n\r\nTo the best of my recollection, these are the sentiments of M.\r\nJACOBI, expressed twelve or fourteen years ago; yet I do not find\r\nthat the waltz is discontinued, or even less practised, in Germany,\r\nthan it was at the time when his work first appeared. This dance,\r\nlike every other French fashion, has now found its way into England,\r\nand is introduced between the acts, by way of interlude I presume, at\r\nsome of our grand private balls and assemblies. But, however I may be\r\namused by the waltzing of the Parisian belles, I feel too much regard\r\nfor my fair country-women to wish to see them adopt a dance, which,\r\nby throwing them off their guard, lays them completely open to the\r\nshafts of ridicule and malice.\r\n\r\nLeaving this point to be settled by the worthy part of our British\r\nmatrons, let us return to the Parisian ball, from which I have been\r\nled into a little digression.\r\n\r\nThe dancing continued in this manner, that is, French country-dances\r\nand waltzes alternately, till four o'clock, when soup was brought\r\nround to all the company. This was dispatched _sans façon_, as fast\r\nas it could be procured. It was a prelude to the cold supper, which\r\nwas presently served in another spacious apartment. No sooner were\r\nthe folding-doors of an adjoining room thrown open, than I observed\r\nthat, large as it was, it could not possibly afford accommodation to\r\nmore than half of the number present. I therefore remained in the\r\nback-ground, naturally supposing that places would first be provided\r\nfor all the women. Not so, my friend; several men seated themselves,\r\nand, in the twinkling of an eye, deranged the economy of the whole\r\ntable; while the female bystanders were necessitated to seek seats at\r\nsome temporary tables placed in the ballroom. Here too were they in\r\nluck if they obtained a few fragments from the grand board; for, such\r\ndetermined voracity was there exhibited, that so many vultures or\r\ncormorants could not have been more expeditious in clearing the\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an enormous salmon, which would have done honour to the\r\nTweed or the Severn, graced the middle of the principal table. In\r\nless than five minutes after the company were seated, I turned round,\r\nand missing the fish, inquired whether it had proved tainted. No: but\r\nit is all devoured, was the reply of a young man, who, pointing to\r\nthe bone, offered me a pear and a piece of bread, which he shrewdly\r\nobserved was all that I might probably get to recruit my strength at\r\nthis entertainment. I took the hint, and, with the addition of a\r\nglass of common wine, at once made my supper.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour, the tables being removed, the ball was resumed, and\r\napparently with renewed spirit. The card-room had never been\r\ndeserted. _Mind the main chance_ is a wholesome maxim, which the good\r\nlady of the house seemed not to have forgotten. Assisted by a sort of\r\n_croupier_, she did the honours of the _bouillotte_ with that\r\nadmirable sang-froid which you and I have often witnessed in some of\r\nour hostesses of fashion; and, had she not communicated to me the\r\nsecret, I should have been the last to suspect, while she appeared so\r\nindifferent, that she, like those ladies, had so great an interest in\r\nthe card-party being continued till morning.\r\n\r\nAs an old acquaintance, she took an opportunity of saying to, me,\r\nwith joy in her eyes: \"_Le jeu va bien_;\" but, at the same time,\r\nexpressed her regret that the supper was such a scramble. While we\r\nwere in conversation, I inquired the name and character of the most\r\nstriking women in the room, and found that, though a few of them\r\nmight be reckoned substantial in fortune, as well as in reputation,\r\nthe female part of the company was chiefly composed of ladies who,\r\nlike herself, had suffered by the revolution; several were divorced\r\nfrom their husbands, but as incompatibility of temper was the general\r\nplea for such a disunion, that alone could not operate as a blemish.\r\n\r\nTo judge of the political predilection of these belles from their\r\nexterior, a stranger would, nine times out of ten, be led into a\r\npalpable error. He might naturally conclude them to be attached to a\r\nrepublican system, since they have, in general, adopted the Athenian\r\nform of attire as their model; though they have not, in the smallest\r\ndegree, adopted the simple manners of that people. Their arms are\r\nbare almost to the very shoulder; their bosom is, in a great measure,\r\nuncovered; their ankles are encircled by narrow ribbands in imitation\r\nof the fastenings of sandals; and their hair, turned up close behind,\r\nis confined on the crown of the head in a large knot, as we see it in\r\nthe antique busts of Grecian beauties.\r\n\r\nThe rest of their dress is more calculated to display, than to veil\r\nthe contours of their person. It was thus explained to me by my\r\nfriend, the _ci-devant Comtesse_, who at the same time assured  me\r\nthat young French women, clad in this airy manner, brave all the\r\nrigour of winter. \"A simple piece of linen, slightly laced before,\"\r\nsaid she, \"while it leaves the waist uncompressed, answers the\r\npurpose of a corset. If they put on a robe, which is not open in\r\nfront, they dispense with petticoats altogether; their cambric\r\n_chemise_ having the semblance of one, from its skirt being trimmed\r\nwith lace. When attired for a ball, those who dance, as you may\r\nobserve, commonly put on a tunic, and then a petticoat becomes a\r\nmatter of necessity, rather than of choice. Pockets being deemed an\r\nincumbrance, they wear none: what money they carry, is contained in a\r\nlittle morocco leather purse; this is concealed in the centre of the\r\nbosom, whose form, in our well-shaped women, being that of the\r\nMedicean Venus, the receptacle occasionally serves for a little gold\r\nwatch, or some other trinket, which is suspended to the neck by a\r\ncollar of hair, decorated with various ornaments. When they dance,\r\nthe fan is introduced within the zone or girdle; and the handkerchief\r\nis kept in the pocket of some sedulous swain, to whom the fair one\r\nhas recourse when she has occasion for it. Some of the elderly\r\nladies, like myself,\" added she, \"carry these appendages in a sort of\r\nwork-bag, denominated a _ridicule_. Not long since, this was the\r\nuniversal fashion first adopted as a substitute for pockets; but, at\r\npresent, it is totally laid aside by the younger classes.\"\r\n\r\nThe men at this ball, were, for the most part, of the military class,\r\nthinly interspersed with returned emigrants. Some of the generals and\r\ncolonels were in their hussar dress-uniform, which is not only\r\nexceedingly becoming to a well-formed man, but also extremely\r\nsplendid and costly. All the seams of the jacket and pantaloons of\r\nthe generals are covered with rich and tasteful embroidery, as well\r\nas their sabre-tash, and those of the colonels with gold or silver\r\nlace: a few even wore boots of red morocco leather.\r\n\r\nMost of the Gallic youths, having served in the armies, either a few\r\nyears ago under the requisition, or more recently under the\r\nconscription, have acquired a martial air, which is very discernible,\r\nin spite of their _habit bourgeois_. The brown coat cannot disguise\r\nthe soldier. I have met with several young merchants of the first\r\nrespectability in Paris, who had served, some two, others four years\r\nin the ranks, and constantly refused every sort of advancement. Not\r\nwishing to remain in the army, and relinquish the mercantile\r\nprofession in which they had been educated, they cheerfully passed\r\nthrough their military servitude as privates, and, in that station,\r\nlike true soldiers, gallantly fought their country's battles.\r\n\r\nThe hour of six being arrived, I was assailed, on all sides, by\r\napplications to set down this or that lady, as the morning was very\r\nrainy, and, independently of the long rank of hackney-coaches, which\r\nhad been drawn up at the door, every vehicle that could be procured,\r\nhad long been in requisition. The mistress of the house had informed\r\ntwo of her particular female friends that I had a carriage in\r\nwaiting; and as I could accommodate only a certain number at a time,\r\nafter having consented to take those ladies home first; I conceived\r\nmyself at liberty, on my return, to select the rest of my convoy. To\r\nrelieve beauty in distress was one of the first laws of ancient\r\nchivalry; and no knight ever accomplished that vow with greater\r\nardour than I did on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 7, 1801._\r\n\r\nMy impatience is at length gratified. I have seen BONAPARTE.\r\nYesterday, the 6th, as I mentioned in a former letter, was the day of\r\nthe grand parade, which now takes place on the fifteenth only of\r\nevery month of the Republican Calendar. The spot where this military\r\nspectacle is exhibited, is the court-yard of the palace of the\r\n_Tuileries_, which, as I have before observed, is enclosed by a low\r\nparapet wall, surmounted by a handsome iron railing.\r\n\r\nFrom the kind attention of friend, I had the option of being admitted\r\ninto the palace, or introduced into the hotel of Cn. MARET, the\r\nSecretary of State, which adjoins to the palace, and standing at\r\nright angles with it, commands a full view of the court where the\r\ntroops are assembled. In the former place, I was told, I should not,\r\non account of the crowd, have an opportunity to see the parade,\r\nunless I took my station at a window two or three hours before it\r\nbegan; while from the latter, I should enjoy the sight without any\r\nannoyance or interruption.\r\n\r\nConsidering that an interval of a month, by producing a material\r\nchange in the weather, might render the parade far less brilliant and\r\nattractive, and also that such an offer might not occur a second\r\ntime, I made no hesitation in preferring Cn. MARET'S hotel.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by my introducer, I repaired thither about half past\r\neleven o'clock, and certainly I had every reason to congratulate\r\nmyself on my election. I was ushered into a handsome room on the\r\nfirst-floor, where I found the windows partly occupied by some lovely\r\nwomen. Having paid my devoirs to the ladies, I entered into\r\nconversation with an officer of rank of my acquaintance, who had\r\nintroduced me to them; and from him I gathered the following\r\nparticulars respecting the\r\n\r\nGRAND MONTHLY PARADE.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of every month, the First Consul in person reviews\r\nall the troops of the consular guard, as well as those quartered in\r\nParis, as a garrison, or those which may happen to be passing through\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nThe consular guard is composed of two battalions of foot-grenadiers,\r\ntwo battalions of light infantry, a regiment of horse-grenadiers, a\r\nregiment of mounted chasseurs or guides, and two companies of flying\r\nartillery. All this force may comprise between six and seven thousand\r\nmen; but it is in contemplation to increase it by a squadron of\r\nMamalûks, intermixed with Greeks and Syrians, mounted on Arabian\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nThis guard exclusively does duty at the palace of the _Tuileries_,\r\nand at _Malmaison_, BONAPARTE's country-seat: it also forms the\r\nmilitary escort of the Consuls. At present it is commanded by General\r\nLASNES; but, according to rumour, another arrangement is on the point\r\nof being made. The consular guard is soon to have no other chief than\r\nthe First Consul, and under him are to command, alternately, four\r\ngenerals; namely, one of infantry, one of cavalry, one of artillery,\r\nand one of engineers; the selection is said to have fallen on the\r\nfollowing officers, BESSIÈRES, DAVOUST, SOULT, and SONGIS.\r\n\r\nThe garrison (as it is termed) of Paris is not constantly of the same\r\nstrength. At this moment it consists of three demi-brigades of the\r\nline, a demi-brigade of light infantry, a regiment of dragoons, two\r\ndemi-brigades of veterans, the horse _gendarmerie_, and a new corps\r\nof choice _gendarmerie_, comprising both horse and foot, and\r\ncommanded by the _Chef de brigade_ SAVABY, aide-de-camp to the First\r\nConsul. This garrison may amount to about 15,000 effective men.\r\n\r\nThe consular guard and all these different corps, equipped in their\r\nbest manner, repair to the parade, and, deducting the troops on duty,\r\nthe number of men assembled there may, in general be from twelve to\r\nfifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nBy a late regulation, no one, during the time of the parade, can\r\nremain within the railing of the court, either on foot or horseback,\r\nexcept the field and staff officers on duty; but persons enter the\r\napartments of the _Tuileries_, by means of tickets, which are\r\ndistributed to a certain number by the governor of the palace.\r\n\r\nWhile my obliging friend was communicating to me the above\r\ninformation, the troops continued marching into the court below, till\r\nit was so crowded that, at first sight, it appeared impracticable for\r\nthem to move, much less to manoeuvre. The morning was extremely fine;\r\nthe sun shone in full splendour, and the gold and silver lace and\r\nembroidery on the uniforms of the officers and on the trappings of\r\ntheir chargers, together with their naked sabres, glittered with\r\nuncommon lustre. The concourse of people without the iron railing was\r\nimmense: in short, every spot or building, even to the walls and\r\nrafters of houses under demolition, whence a transient view of the\r\nparade could be obtained, was thronged with spectators.\r\n\r\nBy twelve o'clock, all the troops were drawn up in excellent order,\r\nand, as you may suppose, presented a grand _coup d'oeil._ I never\r\nbeheld a finer set of men than the grenadiers of the consular guard;\r\nbut owing, perhaps, to my being accustomed to see our troops with\r\nshort skirts, I thought that the extreme length of their coats\r\ndetracted from their military air. The horses mostly of Norman breed,\r\ncould not be compared to our English steeds, either for make or\r\nfigure; but, sorry and rough as is their general appearance, they\r\nare, I am informed, capable of bearing much fatigue, and resisting\r\nsuch privations as would soon render our more sleek cavalry unfit for\r\nservice. That they are active, and surefooted, I can vouch; for, in\r\nall their sudden wheelings and evolutions in this confined space, not\r\none of them stumbled. They formed, indeed, a striking contrast to the\r\nbeautiful white charger that was led about in waiting for the Chief\r\nConsul.\r\n\r\nThe band of the consular guard, which is both numerous and select,\r\ncontinued playing martial airs, till the colours having been brought\r\ndown from the palace, under the escort of an officer and a small\r\ndetachment, the drums beat _aux champs_, and the troops presented\r\narms, when they were carried to their respective stations. Shortly\r\nafter, the impatient steed, just mentioned, was conducted to the foot\r\nof the steps of the grand vestibule of the palace. I kept my eye\r\nstedfastly fixed on that spot; and such was the agility displayed by\r\nBONAPARTE in mounting his horse, that, to borrow the words of\r\nShakspeare, he seemed to\r\n\r\n  \"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,\r\n  And vaulted with such ease into his seat,\r\n  As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds\r\n  To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,\r\n  And witch the world with noble horsemanship.\"\r\n\r\nOff he went at a hand canter, preceded by his aides-de-camp, and\r\nattended, on his right, by General LASNES and followed by other\r\nsuperior officers, particularly the general commanding the garrison\r\nof Paris, and him at the head of the district.\r\n\r\nBONAPARTE was habited in the consular dress, scarlet velvet\r\nembroidered with gold, and wore a plain cocked hat with the national\r\ncockade. As I purpose to obtain a nearer view of him, by placing\r\nmyself in the apartments of the palace on the next parade day, I\r\nshall say nothing of his person till that opportunity offers, but\r\nconfine myself to the military show in question.\r\n\r\nHaving rid rapidly along the several lines of infantry and cavalry,\r\nand saluted the colours as he passed, BONAPARTE (attended by all his\r\nretinue, including a favourite Mamalûk whom he brought from Egypt),\r\ntook a central position, when the different corps successively filed\r\noff before him with most extraordinary briskness; the corps composing\r\nthe consular guard preceded those of the garrison and all the others:\r\non inquiry, however, I find, that this order is not always observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no less extraordinary than true, that the news of the\r\nestablishment of this grand parade produced on the mind of the late\r\nemperor of Russia the first impression in favour of the Chief Consul.\r\nNo sooner did Paul I. hear of the circumstance, than he exclaimed:\r\n\"BONAPARTE is, however, a great man.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the day was so favourable, the parade was soon over, as\r\nthere was no distribution of arms of honour, such as muskets,\r\npistols, swords, battle-axes, &c. which the First Consul presents\r\nwith his own hand to those officers and soldiers who have\r\ndistinguished themselves by deeds of valour or other meritorious\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe whole ceremony did not occupy more than half an hour, when\r\nBONAPARTE alighted at the place where he had taken horse, and\r\nreturned to his audience-room in the palace, for the purpose of\r\nholding his levee. I shall embrace a future opportunity to speak of\r\nthe interior etiquette observed on this occasion in the apartments,\r\nand close this letter with an assurance that you shall have an early\r\naccount of the approaching _fête_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 8, 1801._\r\n\r\nGreat preparations for the _fête_ of to-morrow have, for several\r\ndays, employed considerable numbers of people: it therefore becomes\r\nnecessary that I should no longer delay to give you an idea of the\r\nprincipal scene of action. For that purpose, we must direct our steps\r\nto the\r\n\r\nJARDIN DES TUILERIES.\r\n\r\nThis garden, which is the most magnificent in Paris, was laid out by\r\nthe celebrated LE NOTRE in the reign of Lewis XIV. It covers a space\r\nof three hundred and sixty toises[1] long by one hundred and\r\nsixty-eight broad. To the north and south, it is bordered, throughout\r\nits length, by two terraces, one on each side, which, with admirable\r\nart, conceal the irregularity of the ground, and join at the farther\r\nend in the form of a horse-shoe. To the east, it is limited by the\r\npalace of the _Tuileries_; and to the west, by the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_.\r\n\r\nFrom the vestibule of the palace, the perspective produces a most\r\nstriking effect: the eye first wanders for a moment over the\r\nextensive parterre, which is divided into compartments, planted with\r\nshrubs and flowers, and decorated with basins, _jets-d'eau_, vases,\r\nand statues in marble and bronze; it then penetrates through a\r\nvenerable grove which forms a beautiful vista; and, following the\r\nsame line, it afterwards discovers a fine road, bordered with trees,\r\nleading by a gentle ascent to _Pont de Neuilly_, through the\r\n_Barrière de Chaillot_, where the prospect closes.\r\n\r\nThe portico of the palace has been recently decorated with several\r\nstatues. On each side of the principal door is a lion in marble.\r\n\r\nThe following is the order in which the copies of antique statues,\r\nlately placed in this garden, are at present disposed.\r\n\r\nOn the terrace towards the river, are: 1. Venus _Anadyomene_. 2. An\r\nApollo of Belvedere. 3. The group of Laocoon. 4. Diana, called by\r\nantiquaries, _Succincta_. 5. Hercules carrying Ajax.\r\n\r\nIn front of the palace: 1. A dying gladiator. 2. A fighting\r\ngladiator. 3. The flayer of Marsyas. 4. VENUS, styled _à la\r\ncoquille_, crouched and issuing from the bath. N. B. All these\r\nfigures are in bronze.\r\n\r\nIn the alley in front of the parterre, in coming from the terrace\r\nnext the river: 1. Flora Farnese. 2. Castor and Pollux. 3. Bacchus\r\ninstructing young Hercules. 4. Diana.\r\n\r\nOn the grass-plot, towards the _manège_ or riding-house, Hippomenes\r\nand Atalanta. At the further end is an Apollo, in front of the\r\nhorse-shoe walk, decorated with a sphynx at each extremity.\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding gras-plot towards the river, Apollo and Daphne;\r\nand at the further end, a Venus _Callypyga_, or (according to the\r\nFrench term) _aux belles fesses_.\r\n\r\nIn the compartment by the horse-chesnut trees, towards the\r\nriding-house, the Centaur. On the opposite side, the Wrestlers.\r\nFarther on, though on the same side, an Antinoüs.\r\n\r\nIn the niche, under the steps in the middle of the terrace towards\r\nthe river, a Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nIn the alley of orange-trees, near the _Place de la Concorde_,\r\nMeleager; and on the terrace, next to the riding-house, Hercules\r\nFarnese.\r\n\r\nIn the niche to the right, in front of the octagonal basin, a Faun\r\ncarrying a kid. In the one to the left, Mercury Farnese.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these copies after the antique, the garden is\r\ndecorated with several other modern statues, by COYZEVOX, REGNAUDIN,\r\nCOSTOU, LE GROS, LE PAUTRE, &c. which attest the degree of perfection\r\nthat had been attained, in the course of the last century, by French\r\nsculptors. For a historical account of them, I refer you to a work,\r\nwhich I shall send you by the first opportunity, written by the\r\nlearned MILLIN.\r\n\r\nHere, in summer, the wide-spreading foliage of the lofty\r\nhorse-chesnut trees afford a most agreeable shade; the air is\r\ncooled by the continual play of the _jets-d'eau_; while upwards of\r\ntwo hundred orange-trees, which are then set out, impregnate it with\r\na delightful perfume. The garden is now kept in much better order\r\nthan it was under the monarchy. The flower-beds are carefully\r\ncultivated; the walks are well gravelled, rolled, and occasionally\r\nwatered; in a word, proper attention is paid to the convenience\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding these attractions, as long as it was necessary\r\nfor every person entering this garden to exhibit to the sentinels the\r\nnational cockade, several fair royalists chose to relinquish its\r\ncharming walks, shaded by trees of a hundred years' growth, rather\r\nthan comply with the republican mandate. Those anti-revolutionary\r\n_élégantes_ resorted to other promenades; but, since the accession of\r\nthe consular government, the wearing of this doubtful emblem of\r\npatriotism has been dispensed with, and the garden of the _Tuileries_\r\nis said to be now as much frequented in the fine season as at any\r\nperiod of the old _régime_.\r\n\r\nThe most constant visiters are the _quidnuncs_, who, according to the\r\ndifference of the seasons, occupy alternately three walks; the\r\n_Terrasse des Feuillans_ in winter; that which is immediately\r\nunderneath in spring; and the centre or grand alley during the summer\r\nor autumn.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, this garden was not open to the populace,\r\nexcept on the festival of St. Lewis, and the eve preceding, when\r\nthere was always a public concert, given under a temporary\r\namphitheatre erected against the west façade of the palace: at\r\npresent no person whatever is refused admittance.\r\n\r\nThere are six entrances, at each of which sentinels are regularly\r\nmounted from the grenadiers of the consular guard; and, independently\r\nof the grand guard-room over the vestibule of the palace, there is\r\none at the end of the garden which opens on the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_, and another on the _Terrasse des Feuillans_.\r\n\r\nBut what is infinitely more interesting, on this terrace, is a new\r\nand elegant building, somewhat resembling a _casino_, which at once\r\nunites every accommodation that can be wished for in a coffee-house,\r\na tavern, or a confectioner's. Here you may breakfast _à l'Anglaise_\r\nor _à la fourchette_, that is in the most substantial manner, in the\r\nFrench fashion, read the papers, dine, or sup sumptuously in any\r\nstyle you choose, or drink coffee and liqueurs, or merely eat ices.\r\nWhile thus engaged, you enjoy a full view of the company passing and\r\nrepassing, and what adds beyond measure to the beauty of the scene,\r\nis the presence of the ladies, who not unfrequently come hither with\r\ntheir admirers to indulge in a _téte-à-téte_, or make larger parties\r\nto dine or sup at these fashionable rendezvous of good cheer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the scandalous chronicle, Véry, the master of the house,\r\nis indebted to the charms of his wife for the occupation of this\r\ntasteful edifice, which had been erected by the government on a spot\r\nof ground that was national property, and, of course, at its\r\ndisposal. Several candidates were desirous to be tenants of a\r\nbuilding at once so elegant and so centrical. Véry himself had been\r\nunsuccessful, though he had offered a _pot de vin_ (that is the\r\nParisian term for _good-will_) of five hundred louis, and six\r\nthousand francs a year rent. His handsome wife even began to\r\napprehend that her mission would be attended with no better fortune.\r\nShe presented herself, however, to the then Minister of the Interior,\r\nwho, unrelenting as he had hitherto been to all the competitors, did\r\nnot happen to be a Scipio. On the contrary, he is said to have been\r\nso struck by the person of the fair supplicant, that he at once\r\ndeclared his readiness to accede to her request, on condition that\r\nshe would favour him with her company to supper, and not forget to\r\nput her night-cap in her pocket. _Relata refero_.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, I assure you that Madame Véry, without being a\r\nperfect beauty, is what the French call a _beau corps de femme_, or,\r\nin plain English, a very desirable woman, and such as few ministers\r\nof L'n. B--------te's years would choose to dismiss unsatisfied. This\r\nis not the age of continence, and I am persuaded that any man who\r\nsees and converses with the amiable Madame Véry, if he do not envy\r\nthe Minister the nocturnal sacrifice, will, on contemplating the\r\nelegance of her arrangements, at least allow that this spot of ground\r\nhas not been disposed of to disadvantage.\r\n\r\nEvery step we take, in this quarter of Paris, calls to mind some\r\nremarkable circumstance of the history of the revolution. As the\r\nclassic reader, in visiting _Troas_, would endeavour to trace the\r\nsite of those interesting scenes described in the sublime numbers of\r\nthe prince of poets; so the calm observer, in perambulating this\r\ngarden, cannot but reflect on the great political events of which it\r\nhas been the theatre. In front of the west façade of the palace, the\r\nunfortunate Lewis XVI, reviewed the Swiss, and some of the national\r\nguards, very early in the morning of the 10th of August 1792. On the\r\nright, close to the _Terrasse des Feuillans_, still stands the\r\n_manège_ or riding-house, where the National Assembly at that time\r\nheld their sittings, and whither the king, with his family, was\r\nconducted by ROEDERER, the deputy. That building, after having since\r\nserved for various purposes, is at present shut up, and will,\r\nprobably, be taken down, in consequence of projected improvements in\r\nthis quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the west end of the garden, was the famous _Pont\r\ntournant_, by which, on the 11th of July 1789, the Prince de Lambesc\r\nentered it at the head of his regiment of cavalry, and, by\r\nmaltreating some peaceable saunterers, gave the Parisians a specimen\r\nof what they were to expect from the disposition of the court. This\r\ninconsiderate _galopade_, as the French term it, was the first signal\r\nof the general insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe _Pont tournant_ is destroyed, and the ditch filled up. Leaving\r\nthe garden of the _Tuileries_ by this issue, we enter the\r\n\r\nPLACE DE LA CONCORDE.\r\n\r\nThis is the new name given to the _Place de Louis XV_. After the\r\nabolition of royalty in France, it was called the _Place de la\r\nRévolution_. When the reign of terror ceased, by the fall of\r\nRobespierre, it obtained its present appellation, which forms a\r\nstrong contrast to the number of victims that have here been\r\nsacrificed to the demon of faction.\r\n\r\nThis square, which is seven hundred and eighty feet in length by six\r\nhundred and thirty in breadth, was planned after the treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and finished in 1763. It forms a parallelogram\r\nwith its angles cut off, which are surrounded by ditches, guarded by\r\nbalustrades, breast high. To repair from the _Tuileries_ to the\r\n_Champs Elysées_, you cross it in a straight line from east to west,\r\nand from north to south, to proceed from the _Rue de la Concorde\r\n(ci-devant Rue Royale)_ to the _Pont de la Concorde (ci-devant\r\nPont de Louis XVI.)_\r\n\r\nNear the intersection of these roads stood the equestrian statue in\r\nbronze of Lewis XV, which caught the eye in a direct line with the\r\ncentre of the grand alley of the garden of the _Tuileries_. It has\r\nsince been replaced by a statue of Liberty. This colossal figure was\r\nremoved a few days ago, and, by all accounts, will not be re-erected.\r\n\r\nThe north part of this square, the only one that is occupied by\r\nbuildings, presents, on each side of the _Rue de la Concorde_, two\r\nedifices, each two hundred and forty-eight feet in front, decorated\r\nwith insulated columns of the Corinthian order, to the number of\r\ntwelve, and terminated by two pavilions, with six columns, crowned by\r\na pediment. On the ground-floor of these edifices, one of which, that\r\nnext the _Tuileries_, was formerly the _Garde-Meuble de la Couronne_,\r\nare arcades that form a gallery, in like manner as the colonnade\r\nabove, the cornice of which is surmounted by a balustrade. I have\r\nbeen thus particular in describing this façade, in order to enable\r\nyou to judge of the charming effect which it must produce, when\r\nilluminated with thousands of lamps on the occasion of the grand\r\n_fête_ in honour of peace, which takes place to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt was in the right hand corner of this square, as you come out of\r\nthe garden of the _Tuileries_ by the centre issue, that the terrible\r\nguillotine was erected. From the window of a friend's room, where I\r\nam now writing, I behold the very spot which has so often been\r\ndrenched with the mixed blood of princes, poets, legislators,\r\nphilosophers, and plebeians. On that spot too fell the head of one of\r\nthe most powerful monarchs in Europe.\r\n\r\nI have heard much regret expressed respecting this execution; I have\r\nwitnessed much lamentation excited by it both in England and France;\r\nbut I question whether any of those loyal subjects, who deserted\r\ntheir king when they saw him in danger, will ever manifest the\r\nsincere affection, the poignant sensibility of DOMINIQUE SARRÈDE.\r\n\r\nTo follow Henry IV to the battle of Ivry in 1533, SARRÈDE had his\r\nwounded leg cut off, in order that he might be enabled to sit on\r\nhorseback. This was not all. His attachment to his royal master was\r\nso great, that, in passing through the _Rue de la Ferronnerie_ two\r\ndays after the  assassination of that prince, and surveying the fatal\r\nplace where it had been committed, he was so overcome by grief, that\r\nhe fell almost dead on the spot, and actually expired the next\r\nmorning. I question, I say, whether any one of those emigrants, who\r\nmade so officious a display of their zeal, when they knew it to be\r\nunavailing, will ever moisten with a single tear the small space of\r\nearth stained with the blood of their unfortunate monarch.\r\n\r\nSince I have been in Paris, I have met with a person of great\r\nrespectability, totally unconnected with politics, who was present at\r\nseveral of those executions: at first he attended them from\r\ncuriosity, which soon degenerated into habit, and at last became an\r\noccupation. He successively beheld the death of Charlotte Corday,\r\nMadame Roland, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Madame Elizabeth,\r\nPhilippe Egalité, Madame du Barry, Danton, Robespierre, Couthon, St.\r\nJust, Henriot, Fouquier-Tinville, _cum mullis aliis_, too numerous to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nAmong other particulars, this person informed me that Lewis XVI\r\nstruggled much, by which the fatal instrument cut through the back of\r\nhis head, and severed his jaw: the queen was more resigned; on the\r\nscaffold, she even apologized to Samson, the executioner in chief,\r\nfor treading accidentally on his toe. Madame Roland met her fate with\r\nthe calm heroism of a Roman matron. Charlotte Corday died with a\r\nserene and dignified countenance; one of the executioners having\r\nseized her head when it fell, and given it several slaps, this base\r\nact of cowardice raised a general murmur among the people.\r\n\r\nAs to Robespierre, no sooner had he ascended the scaffold, amid the\r\nvociferous acclamations of the joyful multitude, than the executioner\r\ntore off the dirty bandage in which his wounded head was enveloped\r\nand which partlv concealed his pale and ferocious visage. This made\r\nthe wretch roar like a wild beast. His under jaw then falling from\r\nthe upper, and streams of blood gushing from the wound, gave him the\r\nmost ghastly appearance that can be imagined. When the national\r\nrazor, as the guillotine was called by his partisans, severed\r\nRobespierre's head from his body; and the executioner, taking it by\r\nthe hair, held it up to the view of the spectators, the plaudits\r\nlasted for twenty minutes. Couthon, St. Just, and Henriot, his\r\nheralds of murder, who were placed in the same cart with himself,\r\nnext paid the debt of their crimes. They were much disfigured, and\r\nthe last had lost an eye. Twenty-two persons were guillotined at the\r\nsame time with Robespierre, all of them his satellites. The next day,\r\nseventy members of the commune, and the day following twelve others,\r\nshared the fate of their atrocious leader, who, not many hours\r\nbefore, was styled the virtuous and incorruptible patriot.\r\n\r\nYou may, probably, imagine that, whatever dispatch might be employed,\r\nthe execution of seventy persons, would demand a rather considerable\r\nportion of time, an hour and a half, or two hours, for instance. But,\r\nhow wide of the mark! Samson, the executioner of Paris, worked the\r\nguillotine with such astonishing quickness, that, including the\r\npreparatives of the punishment, he has been known to cut off no less\r\nthan forty-five heads, the one after the other, in the short space of\r\nfifteen minutes; consequently, at this expeditious rate of three\r\nheads in one minute it required no more than twenty-three minutes and\r\ntwenty seconds to decapitate seventy persons.\r\n\r\nGuillotin, the physician, who invented or rather improved this\r\nmachine, which is called after his name with a feminine termination,\r\nis said to have been a man of humanity; and, on that principle alone,\r\nhe recommended the use of it, from the idea of saving from painful\r\nsensations criminals condemned to die. Seeing the abuse made of it,\r\nfrom the facility which it afforded of dispatching several persons in\r\na few minutes, he took the circumstance so much to heart that grief\r\nspeedily shortened his existence.\r\n\r\nAccording to Robespierre, however, the axe of the guillotine did not\r\ndo sufficient execution. One of his satellites announced to him the\r\ninvention of an instrument which struck off nine heads at once: the\r\ndiscovery pleased him, and he caused several trials of this new\r\nmachine to be made at _Bicêtre_. It did not answer; but human nature\r\ngained nothing by its failure. Instead of half a dozen victims a day,\r\nRobespierre wished to have daily fifty or sixty, or more; and he was\r\nbut too well obeyed. Not only had he his own private lists of\r\nproscription; but all his creatures, from the president of the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal down to the under-jailers, had similar lists;\r\nand the _almanac royal_, or French court calendar, was converted into\r\none by himself.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the streets through which the unfortunate\r\nsufferers were carried, wearied at length by the daily sight of so\r\nmelancholy a spectacle, ventured to utter complaints. Robespierre, no\r\nless suspicious than cruel, was alarmed, and, dreading an\r\ninsurrection, removed the scene of slaughter. The scaffold was\r\nerected on the _Place de la Bastille_: but the inhabitants of this\r\nquarter also murmured, and the guillotine was transferred to the\r\n_Barrière St. Antoine_.\r\n\r\nHad not this modern Nero been cut off in the midst of his cruelties,\r\nit is impossible to say where he would have stopped. Being one day\r\nasked the question, he coolly answered: \"The generation which has\r\nwitnessed the old _règime_, will always regret it. Every individual\r\nwho was more than fifteen in 1789, must be put to death: this is the\r\nonly way to consolidate the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same in the departments as in Paris. Every where blood ran\r\nin streams. In all the principal towns the guillotine was rendered\r\npermanent, in order, as Robespierre expressed himself, to _regenerate\r\nthe nation_. If this sanguinary monster did not intend to \"wade\r\nthrough slaughter to a throne,\" it is certain at least that he \"shut\r\nthe gates of mercy on mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBut what cannot fail to excite your astonishment and that of every\r\nthinking person, is, that, in the midst of these executions, in the\r\nmidst of these convulsions of the state, in the midst of these\r\nstruggles for power, in the midst of these outcries against the\r\ndespots of the day, in the midst of famine even, not artificial, but\r\nreal; in short, in the midst of an accumulation of horrors almost\r\nunexampled, the fiddle and tambourin never ceased. Galas, concerts,\r\nand balls were given daily in incredible numbers; and no less than\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty theatres, besides several, other places of\r\npublic entertainment, were constantly open, and almost as constantly\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am this moment informed of the arrival of Lord Cornwallis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The ratio between the English fathom and the French\r\ntoise, as determined between the first astronomers of both countries,\r\nis as 72 to 76.734.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 10, 1801._\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 8th, there was a representation _gratis_ at all\r\nthe theatres, it being the eve of the great day, of the occurrences\r\nof which I shall now, agreeably to my promise, endeavour to give you\r\na narrative. I mean the\r\n\r\n  NATIONAL FÉTE,\r\n  IN HONOUR OF PEACE,\r\n  _Celebrated on the 18th of Brumaire, year X_,\r\n  _the anniversary of_ BONAPARTE'S\r\n  _accession to the consulate_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prayers which the Parisians had addressed to the\r\nsun for the preceding twenty-four hours,\r\n\r\n  \"----_Nocte pluit totà, redeunt spectacula mane_,\"\r\n\r\nit rained all night, and was still raining yesterday morning, when\r\nthe day was ushered in by discharges of artillery from the saluting\r\nbattery at the _Hôtel des Invalides_. This did not disturb me; I\r\nslept soundly till, about eight o'clock, a tintamarre of trumpets,\r\nkettle-drums, &c. almost directly under my window, roused me from my\r\npeaceful slumber. For fear of losing the sight, I immediately\r\npresented myself at the casement, just as I rose, in my shirt and\r\nnight-cap. The officers of the police, headed by the Prefect, and\r\nescorted by a party of dragoons, came to the _Place des Victoires_,\r\nas the third station, to give publicity, by word of mouth, to the\r\nProclamation of the Consuls, of which I inclose you a printed copy.\r\nThe civil officers were habited in their dresses of parade, and\r\ndecorated with tricoloured sashes; the heads of their steeds, which,\r\nby the bye, were not of a fiery, mettlesome race, being adorned in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony being over, I returned not to bed, but sat down to a\r\nsubstantial breakfast, which I considered necessary for preparing my\r\nstrength for the great fatigues of so busy a day. Presently the\r\nstreets were crowded with people moving towards the river-side,\r\nthough small, but heavy rain continued falling all the forenoon. I\r\ntherefore remained at home, knowing that there was nothing yet to be\r\nseen for which it was worth while to expose myself to a good wetting.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock the sun appeared, as if to satisfy the eager desire of\r\nthe Parisians; the mist ceased, and the weather assumed a promising\r\naspect. In a moment the crowd in the streets was augmented by a\r\nnumber of persons who had till now kept within doors, in readiness to\r\ngo out, like the Jews keeping Easter, _cincti renibus & comedentes\r\nfestinantur_. I also sallied forth, but alone, having previously\r\nrefused every invitation from my friends and acquaintance to place\r\nmyself at any window, or join any party, conceiving that the best\r\nmode to follow the bent of my humour was to go unaccompanied, and,\r\nnot confining myself to any particular spot or person, stroll about\r\nwherever the most interesting objects presented themselves.\r\n\r\nWith this view, I directed my steps towards the _Tuileries_, which,\r\nin spite of the immense crowd, I reached without the smallest\r\ninconvenience. The appearance of carriages of every kind had been\r\nstrictly prohibited, with the exception of those belonging to the\r\nBritish ambassador; a compliment well intended, no doubt, and very\r\ngratifying when the streets were so extremely dirty.\r\n\r\nFor some time I amused myself with surveying the different\r\ncountenances of the groups within immediate reach of my observation,\r\nand which to me was by no means the least diverting part of the\r\nscene; but on few of them could I discover any other impression than\r\nthat of curiosity: I then took my station in the garden of the\r\n_Tuileries_, on the terrace next the river. Hence was a view of the\r\n_Temple of Commerce_ rising above the water, on that part of the\r\nSeine comprised between the _Pont National_ and the _Pont Neuf_. The\r\nquays on each side were full of people; and the windows, as well as\r\nthe roofs of all the neighbouring houses, were crowded beyond\r\nconception. In the newspapers, the sum of 500 francs, or £20\r\nsterling, was asked for the hire of a single window of a house in\r\nthat quarter.\r\n\r\nPreviously to my arrival, a flotilla of boats, decked with streamers\r\nand flags of different colours, had ascended the river from\r\n_Chaillot_ to this temple, and were executing divers evolutions\r\naround it, for the entertainment of the Parisians, who quite drowned\r\nthe music by their more noisy acclamations.\r\n\r\nAbout half after three, the First Consul appeared at one of the\r\nwindows of the apartments of the Third Consul, LEBRUN, which, being\r\nsituated in the _Pavillon de Flore_, as it is called, at the south\r\nend of the palace of the _Tuileries_, command a complete view of the\r\nriver. He and LEBRUN were both dressed in their consular uniform.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, a balloon, previously prepared at this floating\r\n_Temple of Commerce_, and adorned with the flags of different\r\nnations, ascended thence with majestic slowness, and presently took\r\nan almost horizontal direction to the south-west. In the car attached\r\nto it were Garnerin, the celebrated aëronaut, his wife, and two other\r\npersons, who kept waving their tricoloured flags, but were soon under\r\nthe necessity of putting them away for a moment, and getting rid of\r\nsome of their ballast, in order to clear the steeples and other lofty\r\nobjects which appeared to lie in their route. The balloon, thus\r\nlightened, rose above the grosser part of the atmosphere, but with\r\nsuch little velocity as to afford the most gratifying spectacle to an\r\nimmense number of spectators.\r\n\r\nWhile following it with my eyes, I began to draw comparisons in my\r\nmind, and reflect on the rapid improvement made in these machines,\r\nsince I had seen Blanchard and his friend, Dr. Jefferies, leave Dover\r\nCliff in January 1785. They landed safely within a short distance of\r\nCalais, as every one knows: yet few persons then conceived it\r\npossible, or at least probable, that balloons could ever be applied\r\nto any useful purpose, still less to the art of war. We find,\r\nhowever, that at the battle of Fleurus, where the Austrians were\r\ndefeated, Jourdan, the French General, was not a little indebted for\r\nhis victory to the intelligence given him of the enemy's dispositions\r\nby his aëronautic reconnoitring-party.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious Franklin seems to have had a presentiment of the future\r\nutility of this invention. On the first experiments being made of it,\r\nsome one asked him: \"Of what use are balloons?\"--\"Of what use is a\r\nnew-born child!\" was the philosopher's answer.\r\n\r\nGarnerin and his fellow-travellers being now at such a distance as\r\nnot to interest an observer unprovided with a telespope, I thought it\r\nmost prudent to gratify that ever-returning desire, which, according\r\nto Dr. Johnson, excites once a day a serious idea in the mind even of\r\nthe most thoughtless. I accordingly retired to my own apartments,\r\nwhere I had taken care that dinner should be provided for myself and\r\na friend, who, assenting to the propriety of allowing every man the\r\nindulgence of his own caprice, had, like me, been taking a stroll\r\nalone among the innumerable multitude of Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, my friend and I sat chatting over our dessert, in order\r\nthat we might not arrive too soon at the scene of action. At six,\r\nhowever, we rose from table, and separated. I immediately proceeded\r\nto the _Tuileries_, which I entered by the centre gate of the _Place\r\ndu Carrousel_. The whole facade of the palace, from the base of the\r\nlowest pillars up to the very turrets of the pavilions, comprising\r\nthe entablatures, &c. was decorated with thousands of _lampions_,\r\nwhence issued a steady, glaring light. By way of parenthesis, I must\r\ninform you that these _lampions_ are nothing more than little\r\ncircular earthen pans, somewhat resembling those which are used in\r\nEngland as receptacles for small flower-pots. They are not filled\r\nwith oil, but with a substance prepared from the offals of oxen and\r\nin which a thick wick is previously placed. Although the body of\r\nlight proceeding from _lampions_ of this description braves the\r\nweather, yet the smoke which they produce, is no inconsiderable\r\ndrawback on the effect of their splendour.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the brilliancy of the _coup d'oeil_ from the\r\nvestibule of the palace of the _Tuileries_. The grand alley, as well\r\nas the end of the parterre on each side and the edges of the basins,\r\nwas illuminated in a style equally tasteful and splendid. The\r\nframe-work on which the lamps were disposed by millions, represented\r\nlofty arcades of elegant proportion, with their several pillars,\r\ncornices, and other suitable ornaments. The eye, astonished, though\r\nnot dazzled, penetrated through the garden, and, directed by this\r\navenue of light, embraced a view of the temporary obelisk erected\r\non the ridge of the gradual ascent, where stands the _Barrière de\r\nChaillot_; the road on each side of the _Champs Elysées_ presenting\r\nan illuminated perspective, whose vanishing point was the obelisk\r\nbefore-mentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter loitering a short time to contemplate the west façade of the\r\npalace, which, excelling that of the east in the richness of its\r\narchitecture, also excelled it in the splendour of its illuminations,\r\nI advanced along the centre or grand alley to the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_. Here, rose three _Temples_ of correct design and beautiful\r\nsymmetry, the most spacious of which, placed in the centre, was\r\ndedicated to _Peace_, that on the right hand to the _Arts_, and that\r\non the left to _Industry_.\r\n\r\nIn front of these temples, was erected an extensive platform, about\r\nfive feet above the level of the ground, on which was exhibited a\r\npantomime, representing, as I was informed, the horrors of war\r\nsucceeded by the blessings of peace. Though I arrived in time to have\r\nseen at least a part of it, I saw nothing, except the back of the\r\nspectators immediately before me, and others, mounted on chairs and\r\nbenches, some of whom seemed to consider themselves fortunate if they\r\nrecovered their legs, when they came now and then to the ground, by\r\nlosing their equilibrium. These little accidents diverted me for the\r\nmoment; but a misadventure of a truly-comic nature afforded me more\r\nentertainment than any pantomime I ever beheld, and amply consoled me\r\nfor being thus confined to the back-ground.\r\n\r\nA lusty young Frenchman, who, from his head-dress _à la Titus_, I\r\nshall distinguish by that name, escorting a lady whom, on account of\r\nher beautiful hair, I shall style _Berenice_, stood on one of the\r\nhindmost benches. The belle, habited in a tunic _à la Grecque_, with\r\na species of sandals which displayed the elegant form of her leg, was\r\nunfortunately not of a stature sufficiently commanding to see over\r\nthe heads of the other spectators. It was to no purpose that the\r\ngentleman called out \"_à bas les chapeaux!_\" When the hats were off,\r\nthe lady still saw no better. What will not gallantry suggest to a\r\nman of fashionable education? Our considerate youth perceived, at no\r\ngreat distance, some persons standing on a plank supported by a\r\ncouple of casks. Confiding the fair _Berenice_ to my care, he\r\nvanished: but, almost in an, instant, he reappeared, followed by two\r\nmen, bearing an empty hogshead, which, it seems, he procured from the\r\ntavern at the west entrance of the _Tuileries_. To place the cask\r\nnear the feet of the lady, pay for it, and fix her on it, was the\r\nbusiness of a moment. Here then she was, like a statue on its\r\npedestal, enjoying the double gratification of seeing and being seen.\r\nBut, for enjoyment to be complete, we must share it with those we\r\nlove. On examining the space where she stood, the lady saw there was\r\nroom for two, and accordingly invited the gentleman to place himself\r\nbeside her. In vain he resisted her entreaties; in vain he feared to\r\nincommode her. She commanded; he could do no less than obey. Stepping\r\nup on the bench, he thence nimbly sprang to the cask; but, O! fatal\r\ncatastrophe! while, by the light of the neighbouring clusters of\r\nlamps, every one around was admiring the mutual attention of this\r\nsympathizing pair, in went the head of the hogshead.\r\n\r\nOur till-then-envied couple fell suddenly up to the middle of the leg\r\nin the wine-lees left in the cask, by which they were bespattered up\r\nto their very eyes. Nor was this all: being too eager to extricate\r\nthemselves, they overset the cask, and came to the ground, rolling in\r\nit and its offensive contents. It would be no easy matter to picture\r\nthe ludicrous situation of Citizen _Titus_ and Madame _Berenice_.\r\nThis being the only mischief resulting from their fall, a universal\r\nburst of laughter seized the surrounding spectators, in which I took\r\nso considerable a share, that I could not immediately afford my\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 11, 1801._\r\n\r\nWhat fortunate people are the Parisians! Yesterday evening so thick a\r\nfog came on, all at once, that it was almost impossible to discern\r\nthe lamps in the streets, even when they were directly over-head. Had\r\nthe fog occurred twenty-four hours earlier, the effect of the\r\nilluminations would have been entirely lost; and the blind would have\r\nhad the advantage over the clear-sighted. This assertion experience\r\nhas proved: for, some years ago, when there was, for several\r\nsuccessive days, a duration of such fogs in Paris, it was found\r\nnecessary, by persons who had business to transact out of doors, to\r\nhire the blind men belonging to the hospital of the _Quinze-Vingts_,\r\nto lead them about the streets. These guides, who were well\r\nacquainted with the topography of the capital, were paid by the hour,\r\nand sometimes, in the course of the day, each of them cleared five\r\nlouis.\r\n\r\nLast night, persons in carriages, were compelled to alight, and grope\r\ntheir way home as they could: in this manner, after first carefully\r\nascertaining where I was, and keeping quite close to the wall, I\r\nreached my lodgings in safety, in spite of numberless interrogations\r\nput to me by people who had, or pretended to have, lost themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I was interrupted in my account of the _fète_, we were, if I\r\nmistake not, on the _Place de la Concorde_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many loads of small gravel scattered here, with a\r\nview of keeping the place clean, the quantity of mud collected in the\r\nspace of a few hours was really astonishing. _N'importe_ was the\r\nword. No fine lady, by whatever motive she was attracted hither,\r\nregretted at the moment being up to her ankles in dirt, or having the\r\nskirt of her dress bemired. All was busy curiosity, governed by\r\npeaceable order.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I never experienced the smallest uncomfortable squeeze,\r\nexcept, indeed, at the conclusion of the pantomime, when the\r\nimpatient crowd rushed forward, and, regardless of the fixed bayonets\r\nof the guards in possession of the platform, carried it by storm.\r\nImpelled by the torrent, I fortunately happened to be nearly in front\r\nof the steps, and, in a few seconds, I found, myself safely landed on\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nThe guard now receiving a seasonable reinforcement, order was\r\npresently restored without bloodshed; and, though several persons\r\nwere under the necessity of making a retrograde movement, on my\r\ndeclaring that I was an Englishman, I was suffered to retain my\r\nelevated position, till the musicians composing the orchestras,\r\nappropriated to each of the three temples, had taken their stations.\r\nAdmittance then became general, and the temples were presently so\r\ncrowded that the dancers had much difficulty to find room to perform\r\nthe figures.\r\n\r\nGood-humour and decorum, however, prevailed to such a degree that,\r\nduring the number, of hours I mixed in the crowd, I witnessed not the\r\nsmallest disturbance.\r\n\r\nBetween nine and ten o'clock, I went to the _Pont de la Concorde_ to\r\nview the fireworks played off from the _Temple of Commerce_ on the\r\nriver; but these were, as I understand, of a description far inferior\r\nto those exhibited at the last National Fête of the 14th of July, the\r\nanniversary of the taking of the Bastille.\r\n\r\nThis inferiority is attributed to the precaution dictated, by the\r\nhigher authorities, to the authors of the fireworks to limit their\r\ningenuity; as, on the former occasion, some accidents occurred of a\r\nrather serious nature. The spectators, in general, appeared to me to\r\nbe disappointed by the mediocrity of the present exhibition.\r\n\r\nI was compensated for the disappointment by the effect of the\r\nillumination of the quays, which, being faced with stone, form a\r\nlofty rampart on each embankment of the river. These were decorated\r\nwith several tiers of lamps from the top of the parapet to the\r\nwater's edge; the parapets and cornices of the bridges, together with\r\nthe circumference of the arches, were likewise illuminated, as well\r\nas the gallery of the _Louvre_, and the stately buildings adjoining\r\nthe quays.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the Legislative Body, which faces the south end of the\r\n_Pont de la Concorde_, formed a striking object, being adorned, in a\r\nmagnificent style, with variegated lamps and transparencies. No less\r\nsplendid, and in some respects more so, from the extent that it\r\npresented, was the façade of the _ci-devant Garde-Meuble_, and the\r\ncorresponding buildings, which form the north side of the _Place de\r\nla Concorde_, whither I now returned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the latter was beautiful, as you may judge from the\r\ndescription which I have already given you of this façade, in one of\r\nmy preceding letters. Let it suffice then to say, that, from the base\r\nof the lower pillars to the upper cornice, it was covered with lamps\r\nso arranged as to exhibit, in the most brilliant manner, the style\r\nand richness of its architecture.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, having now been attracted in various directions, became\r\nmore penetrable; and, in regaining the platform on the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_, I had a full view of the turrets, battlements, &c. erected\r\nbehind the three temples, in which the skilful machinist had so\r\ncombined his plan, by introducing into it a sight of the famous\r\nhorses brought from _Marly_, and now occupying the entrance of the\r\n_Champs Elysées_, that these beautiful marble representations of that\r\nnoble animal seemed placed here on purpose to embellish his scenery.\r\n\r\nFinding myself chilled by standing so many hours exposed to the\r\ndampness of a November night, I returned to the warmer atmosphere of\r\nthe temples, in order to take a farewell view of the dancers. The\r\nscene was truly picturesque, the male part of the groups being\r\nchiefly composed of journeymen of various trades, and the females\r\nconsisting of a ludicrous medley of all classes; but it required no\r\nextraordinary penetration to perceive, that, with the exception of a\r\nfew particular attachments, the military bore the bell, and, all\r\nthings considered, this was no more than justice. Independently of\r\nbeing the best dancers, after gaining the laurels of victory in the\r\nhard-fought field, who can deny that they deserved the prize of\r\nbeauty?\r\n\r\nThe dancing was kept up with the never-flagging vivacity peculiar to\r\nthis nation, and, as I conclude, so continued till a very late hour\r\nin the morning. At half past eleven I withdrew, with a friend whom I\r\nchanced to meet, to Véry's, the famous _restaurateur's_ in the\r\n_Tuileries_, where we supped. On comparing notes, I found that I had\r\nbeen more fortunate than he, in beholding to advantage all the sights\r\nof the day: though it was meant to be a day of jubilee, yet it was\r\nfar from being productive of that mirth or gaiety which I expected.\r\nThe excessive dearness of a few articles of the first necessity may,\r\nprobably, be one cause of this gloom among the people. Bread, the\r\nstaff of life, (as it may be justly termed in France, where a much\r\ngreater proportion is, in general, consumed than in any other\r\ncountry,) is now at the enormous price of eighteen _sous_ (nine-pence\r\nsterling) for the loaf of four pounds. Besides, the Parisians have\r\ngone through so much during the revolution, that I apprehend they\r\nare, to a certain degree, become callous to the spontaneous\r\nsensations of joy and pleasure. Be the cause what it may, I am\r\npositively assured that the people expressed not so much hilarity at\r\nthis fête as at the last, I mean that of the 14th of July.\r\n\r\nIn my way home, I remarked that few houses were illuminated, except\r\nthose of the rich in the streets which are great thorough-fares.\r\nPeople here, in general, I suppose, consider themselves dispensed\r\nfrom lighting up their private residence from the consideration that\r\nthey collectively contribute to the public illumination, the expenses\r\nof which are defrayed by the government out of the national coffers.\r\n\r\nSeveral songs have been composed and published in commemoration of\r\nthis joyful event. Among those that have fallen under my notice, I\r\nhave selected the following, of which our friend M---s, with his\r\nusual facility and taste, will, I dare say, furnish you an imitation.\r\n\r\n  CHANT D'ALLÉGRESSE,\r\n\r\n  _Pour la paix._\r\n\r\n  Air: _de la Marche Triomphante_.\r\n\r\n  _\"Reviens pour consoler la terre,\r\n    Aimable Paix, descends des cieux,\r\n  Depuis assez long-tems la guerre\r\n    Afflige un peuple généreux,\r\n  Ah! quell' aurore pure & calme\r\n    S'offre à nos regards satisfaits!\r\n  Nous obtenons la double paline\r\n    De la victoire & de la paix._   bis.\r\n\r\n  _\"Disparaissez tristes images,\r\n    D'un tems malheureux qui n'est plus,\r\n  Nous réparerons nos dommages\r\n    Par la sagesse & les vertus.\r\n  Que la paix enfin nous rallie!\r\n    Plus d'ingrats ni de mécontens,\r\n  O triomphe de la patrie!\r\n    Plus de Français indifférens._   bis.\r\n\r\n  _\"Revenez phalanges guerrières,\r\n    Héros vengeurs de mon pays,\r\n  Au sein d'une épouse, d'un père,\r\n    De vos parens, de vos amis,\r\n  Revenez dans votre patrie\r\n    Après tant d'effrayans hazards,\r\n  Trouver ce qui charme la vie,\r\n     L'amitié, l'amour, et les arts._   bis.\r\n\r\n  _\"Oh! vous qui, sous des catacombes,\r\n    Etes couchés au champ d'honneur,\r\n  Nos yeux sont fixés sur vos tombes,\r\n    En chantant l'hymne du vainqueur,\r\n  Nous transmettrons votre mémoire\r\n    Jusqu' aux siécles à venir,\r\n  Avec le burin de l'histoire,\r\n    Et les larmes du souvenir.\"_   bis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SONG OF JOY,\r\n\r\n  _In honor of peace._\r\n  Imitated from the French.\r\n\r\n  To the same tune: _de la Marche Triomphante._\r\n\r\n  Come, lovely Peace, from heav'n descending,\r\n    Thy presence earth at length shall grace;\r\n  Those terrible afflictions ending,\r\n    That long have griev'd a gen'rous race:\r\n  We see Aurora rise refulgent;\r\n    Serene she comes to bless our sight;\r\n  While Fortune to our hopes indulgent,\r\n    Bids victory and peace unite.\r\n\r\n  Be gone, ye dark imaginations,\r\n    Remembrances of horrors past:\r\n  Virtue's and Wisdom's reparations\r\n    Shall soon be made, and ever last.\r\n  Now peace to happiness invites us;\r\n    The bliss of peace is understood:\r\n  With love fraternal peace delights us,\r\n    Our private ease, and country's good.\r\n\r\n  Re-enter, sons of war, your houses;\r\n    Heroic deeds for peace resign:\r\n  Embrace your parents and your spouses,\r\n    And all to whom your hearts incline:\r\n  Behold your countrymen invite you,\r\n    With open, arms, with open hearts;\r\n  Here find whatever can delight you;\r\n    Here friendship, love, and lib'ral arts.\r\n\r\n  Departed heroes, crown'd with glory,\r\n    While you are laid in Honour's bed,\r\n  Sad o'er your tombs we'll sing the story,\r\n    How Gallia's warriors fought and bled:\r\n  And, proud to shew to future ages\r\n    The claims to patriot valour due,\r\n  We'll vaunt, in our historic pages,\r\n    The debt immense we owe to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 13, 1801._\r\n\r\nEnriched, as this capital now is, with the spoils of Greece and\r\nItaly, it may literally be termed the repository of the greatest\r\ncuriosities existing. In the CENTRAL MUSEUM are collected all the\r\nprodigies of the fine arts, and, day after day, you may enjoy the\r\nsight of these wonders.\r\n\r\nI know not whether you are satisfied with the abridged account I gave\r\nyou of the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES; but, on the presumption that you did\r\nnot expect from me a description of every work of sculpture contained\r\nin it, I called your attention to the most pre-eminent only; and I\r\nshall now pursue the same plan, respecting the master-pieces of\r\npainting exhibited in the great\r\n\r\nGALLERY OF THE LOUVRE\r\n\r\nThis gallery, which is thirteen hundred and sixty-five feet in length\r\nby thirty in breadth, runs north and south all along the quays of the\r\nriver Seine, and joins the _Louvre_ to the palace of the _Tuileries_.\r\nIt was begun by Charles IX, carried as far as the first wicket by\r\nHenry IV, to the second by Lewis XIII, and terminated by Lewis XIV.\r\nOne half, beginning from a narrow strip of ground, called the _Jardin\r\nde l'Infante_, is decorated externally with large pilasters of the\r\nComposite order, which run from top to bottom, and with pediments\r\nalternately triangular and elliptical, the tympanums of which, both\r\non the side of the _Louvre_, and towards the river, are charged with\r\nemblems of the Arts and Sciences. The other part is ornamented with\r\ncoupled pilasters, charged with vermiculated rustics, and other\r\nembellishments of highly-finished workmanship.\r\n\r\nIn the inside of this gallery are disposed the _chefs d'oeuvre_ of\r\nall the great masters of the Italian, Flemish, and French schools.\r\nThe pictures, particularly the historical ones, are hung according to\r\nthe chronological order of the painters' birth, in different\r\ncompartments, the number of which, at the present period, amounts to\r\nfifty-seven; and the productions of each school and of each master\r\nare as much as possible assembled; a method which affords the\r\nadvantage of easily comparing one school to another, one master to\r\nanother, and a master to himself. If the chronology of past ages be\r\nconsidered as a book from which instruction is to be imbibed, the\r\npropriety of such a classification requires no eulogium. From the\r\npictures being arranged chronologically, the GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE\r\nbecomes a sort of dictionary, in which may be traced every degree of\r\nimprovement or decline that the art of painting has successively\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the great GALLERY OF PAINTINGS is precisely the same\r\nas that to the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. After ascending a noble stone\r\nstair-case, and turning to the left, you reach the\r\n\r\nSALOON OF THE LOUVRE.\r\n\r\nThis apartment, which serves as a sort of antichamber to the great\r\nGallery, is, at the present moment, appropriated to the annual\r\nmonthly exhibition of the productions of living painters, sculptors,\r\narchitects, engravers, and draughtsmen. Of these modern works, I\r\nshall, perhaps, speak on a future occasion. But, in the course of a\r\nfew days, they will give place to several master-pieces of the\r\nItalian School, some of which were under indispensable repair, when\r\nthe others were arranged in the great Gallery.\r\n\r\nIt would be no easy task to express the various sentiments which take\r\npossession of the mind of the lover of the arts, when, for the first\r\ntime, he enters this splendid repository. By frequent visits,\r\nhowever, the imagination becomes somewhat less distracted, and the\r\njudgment, by degrees, begins to collect itself. Although I am not,\r\nlike you, conversant in the Fine Arts, would you tax me with\r\narrogance, were I to presume to pass an opinion on some of the\r\npictures comprised in this matchless collection?\r\n\r\nPainting being a representation of nature, every spectator, according\r\nto the justness of his ideas, may form an opinion how far the\r\nrepresentation is happily pourtrayed, and in beholding it, experience\r\na proportionate degree of pleasure: but how different the sensations\r\nof him who, combining all the requisites of a connoisseur,\r\ncontemplates the composition of a masterly genius! In tracing the\r\nmerits of such a production, his admiration gradually becomes\r\ninflamed, as his eye strays from beauty to beauty.\r\n\r\nIn painting or sculpture, beauty, as you well know, is either\r\nnatural, or generally admitted: the latter depends on the perfection\r\nof the performance, on certain rules established, and principles\r\nsettled. This is what is termed _ideal_ beauty, which is frequently\r\nnot within the reach of the vulgar; and the merit of which may be\r\nlost on him who has not learned to know and appreciate it. Thus, one\r\nof the finest pictures, ever conceived and executed by man, might\r\nnot, perhaps, make an impression on many spectators. Natural beauty,\r\non the contrary, is a true imitation of nature: its effect is\r\nstriking and general, so that it stands not in need of being pointed\r\nout, but is felt and admired by all.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this truth, be assured that I should never, of my own\r\naccord, have ventured to pronounce on the various degrees of merit of\r\nso many _chefs d'oeuvre_, which all at once solicit attention. This\r\nwould require a depth of knowledge, a superiority of judgment, a\r\nnicety of discrimination, a fund of taste, a maturity of experience,\r\nto none of which have I any pretension. The greatest masters, who\r\nhave excelled in a particular branch, have sometimes given to the\r\nworld indifferent productions; while artists of moderate abilities\r\nhave sometimes produced master-pieces far above their general\r\nstandard. In a picture, which may, on the whole, merit the\r\nappellation of a _chef d'oeuvre_, are sometimes to be found beauties\r\nwhich render it superior, negligences which border on the\r\nindifferent, and defects which constitute the bad. Genius has its\r\nflights and deviations; talent, its successes, attempts, and faults;\r\nand mediocrity even, its flashes and chances.\r\n\r\nWhatever some persons may affect, a true knowledge of the art of\r\npainting is by no means an easy acquirement; it is not a natural\r\ngift, but demands much reading and study. Many there are, no doubt,\r\nwho may be able to descant speciously enough, perhaps, on the\r\nperfections and defects of a picture; but, on that account alone,\r\nthey are not to be regarded as real judges of its intrinsic merit.\r\n\r\nKnow then, that, in selecting the most remarkable productions among\r\nthe vast number exhibited in the CENTRAL MUSEUM, I have had the good\r\nfortune to be directed by the same first-rate connoisseur who was so\r\nobliging as to fix my choice in the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. I mean M.\r\nVISCONTI.\r\n\r\nNot confining myself either to alphabetical or chronological order, I\r\nshall proceed to point out to you such pictures of each school as\r\nclaim particular notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nN. B. _Those pictures to which no number is prefixed, are not yet\r\npublicly exhibited_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAFFAELLO.\r\n\r\n  N° 55. (Saloon.) _The Virgin and Child, &c._ commonly known by the\r\nname of the _Madonna di Foligno_.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the master-pieces of RAPHAEL for vigour of colouring,\r\nand for the beauty of the heads and of the child. It is in his second\r\nmanner; although his third is more perfect, seldom are the pictures\r\nof this last period entirely executed by himself. This picture was\r\noriginally painted on pannel, and was in such a lamentable state of\r\ndecay, that doubts arose whether it could safely be conveyed from\r\nItaly. It has been recently transferred to canvass, and now appears\r\nas fresh and as vivid, as if, instead of a lapse of three centuries,\r\nthree years only had passed since it was painted. Never was an\r\noperation of the like nature performed in so masterly a manner. The\r\nprocess was attended by a Committee of the National Institute,\r\nappointed at the particular request of the Administration of the\r\nMuseum. The _Madonna di Foligno_ is to be engraved from a drawing\r\ntaken by that able draughtsman DU TERTRE.\r\n\r\n  N° ( ) _The Holy Family_.\r\n\r\nThis valuable picture of RAPHAEL'S third manner is one of the most\r\nperfect that ever came from his pencil. It belonged to the old\r\ncollection of the crown, and is engraved by EDELINCK. Although\r\nsuperior to the _Madonna di Foligno_ as to style and composition, it\r\nis inferior in the representation of the child, and in vigour of\r\ncolouring.\r\n\r\n  N° ( ) _The Transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor._\r\n\r\nThis is the last production of RAPHAEL, and his most admirable _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ as to composition and grace of the contours in all its\r\nfigures. It is not yet exhibited, but will be shortly. This picture\r\nis in perfect preservation, and requires only to be cleaned from a\r\ncoat of dust and smoke which has been accumulating on it for three\r\ncenturies, during which it graced the great altar of St. Peter's\r\nchurch at Rome.\r\n\r\nAmong the portraits by RAPHAEL, the most surprising are:\r\n\r\nN° 58. (Saloon.) _Baltazzare Castiglione_, a celebrated writer in\r\nItalian and Latin.\r\n\r\n  N° ( ) _Leo X._\r\n\r\nEvery thing that RAPHAEL'S pencil has produced is in the first order.\r\nThat master has something greatly superior in his manner: he really\r\nappears as a god among painters. Addison seems to have been impressed\r\nwith the truth of this sentiment, when he thus expresses himself:\r\n\r\n  \"Fain would I RAPHAEL'S godlike art rehearse,\r\n  And shew th' immortal labours in my verse,\r\n  When from the mingled strength of shade and light,\r\n  A new creation rises, to my sight:\r\n  Such heav'nly figures from his pencil flow,\r\n  So warm with life his blended colours glow,\r\n  From theme to theme with secret pleasure lost,\r\n  Amidst the soft variety I'm lost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONARDO DA VINCI.\r\n\r\nThere are several pictures by this master in the present exhibition;\r\nbut you may look here in vain for the portrait of _La Gioconda_,\r\nwhich he employed four years in painting, and in which he has\r\nimitated nature so closely, that, as a well-known author has\r\nobserved, \"the eyes have all the lustre of life, the hairs of the eye\r\nbrows and lids seem real, and even the pores of the skin are\r\nperceptible.\"\r\n\r\nThis celebrated picture is now removed to the palace of the\r\n_Tuileries_; but the following one, which remains, is an admirable\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n  N° ( ) _Portrait of Charles VIII._\r\n\r\n\r\nFRA BARTOLOMEO.\r\n\r\n  N° 28. (Saloon.) _St. Mark the Evangelist_.\r\n\r\n  N° 29. (Saloon.) _The Saviour of the world_.\r\n\r\nThese two pictures, which were in the _Pitti_ palace at Florence,\r\ngive the idea of the most noble simplicity, and of no common taste in\r\nthe distribution of the lights and shades.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIULIO ROMANO.\r\n\r\n  N° 35. (Saloon.) _The Circumcision_.\r\n\r\nThis picture belonged to the old collection of the crown. The figures\r\nin it are about a foot and a half in height. It is a real _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_, and has all the grace of the antique bas-reliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIZIANO.\r\n\r\n  N° 69. (Saloon.) _The Martyrdom of St. Peter_.\r\n\r\nThis large picture, which presents a grand composition in colossal\r\nfigures, with a country of extraordinary beauty in the back-ground,\r\nis considered as the _chef d'oeuvre_ of TITIAN. It was painted on\r\npannel; but, having undergone the same operation as the _Madonna di\r\nFoligno_, is now placed on canvass, and is in such a state as to\r\nclaim the admiration of succeeding ages.\r\n\r\n  N° 74. (Saloon.) _The Portraits of Titian and his mistress._\r\n\r\n     70. (Saloon.) _Portrait of the Marquis del Guasto with some\r\nladies_.\r\n\r\nBoth these pictures belonged to the old collection of the crown, and\r\nare to be admired for grace and beauty.\r\n\r\n  N° 940. (Gallery.) _Christ crowned with thorns_.\r\n\r\n     941. (Gallery.) _Christ carried to the grave_.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful vigour of colouring in these two capital\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThe preceding are the most admirable of the productions which are at\r\npresent exhibited of this inimitable master, the first of painters\r\nfor truth of colouring.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORREGGIO.\r\n\r\n  N° 753. (Gallery.) _The Virgin, the infant Jesus, Mary Magdalen,\r\nand St. Jerome._\r\n\r\nThis picture, commonly distinguished by the appellation of the _St.\r\nJerome_ of CORREGGIO, is undoubtedly his _chef d'oeuvre_. In the year\r\n1749, the king of Portugal is said to have offered for it a sum equal\r\nin value to £18,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n  N° 756. (Gallery.) _The Marriage of St. Catherine_.\r\n\r\n     757. (Gallery.) _Christ taken down from the cross_.\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned picture has just been engraved in an excellent\r\nmanner by an Italian artist, M. ROSA-SPINA.\r\n\r\nThe grace of his pencil and his _chiaro oscuro_ place CORREGGIO in\r\nthe first class of painters, where he ranks the third after RAPHAEL\r\nand TITIAN. He is inferior to them in design and composition; however\r\nthe scarceness of his pictures frequently gives them a superior\r\nvalue. Poor CORREGGIO! It grieves one to recollect that he lost his\r\nlife, in consequence of the fatigue of staggering home under a load\r\nof _copper_ coin, which avaricious monks had given him for pictures\r\nnow become so valuable that they are not to be purchased for their\r\nweight, even in _gold_.\r\n\r\nNo collection is so rich in pictures of CORREGGIO as that of the\r\nCENTRAL MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAOLO VERONESE.\r\n\r\n  N° 44. (Saloon.) _The Wedding at Cana_.\r\n\r\n     45. (Saloon.) _The Repast at the house of Levi_.\r\n\r\n     51. (Saloon.) _The Pilgrims of Emmaüs_.\r\n\r\nThese are astonishing compositions for their vast extent, the number\r\nand beauty of the figures and portraits, and the variety and truth of\r\nthe colouring. Nothing in painting can be richer.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA DEL SARTO.\r\n\r\n  N° 4. (Saloon.) _Christ taken down from the cross_.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA SQUAZZELLI (his pupil.)\r\n\r\n  N° (    ) _Christ laid in the tomb_.\r\n\r\nThis capital picture is not in the catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIORGIONE DEL CASTEL-FRANCO.\r\n\r\n  N° 32. (Saloon.) _A Concert containing three portraits_.\r\n\r\nThis master-piece is worthy of TITIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUERCINO.\r\n\r\n  N° 33 (Saloon.) _St. Petronilla_.\r\n\r\nThis large picture was executed for St. Peter's church in the\r\nVatican, where it was replaced by a copy in Mosaic, on being removed\r\nto the pontificate palace of Monte Cavallo, at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the great Gallery are exhibited no less than twenty-three pictures\r\nby GUERCINO: but to speak the truth, though, in looking at some of\r\nhis productions, he appears an extremely agreeable painter, as soon\r\nas you see a number of them, you can no longer bear him. This is what\r\nhappens to _mannerists_. The dark shades at first astonish you,\r\nafterwards they disgust you.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA SACCHI.\r\n\r\n  N° 65. (Saloon.) _St. Remuald_.\r\n\r\nThis picture was always one of the most esteemed of those in the\r\nchurches at Rome. It was the altar-piece of the church of St. Remuald\r\nin that city.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANO.\r\n\r\n  N° 676. (Gallery.) _Fire._\r\n\r\n     677. _Air._\r\n\r\n     678. _Water._\r\n\r\n     679. _Earth._\r\n\r\nIn the Gallery are twenty-nine pictures of this master, and all of\r\nthem graceful; but the preceding four, representing the elements,\r\nwhich were taken from the royal Cabinet of Turin, are the most\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROCCIO.\r\n\r\n  N° 686. (Gallery.) _The Virgin, St Anthony, and St. Lucia._\r\n\r\n     688. _St. Michaelina._\r\n\r\nThese are the best pictures of BAROCCIO already exhibited. His\r\ncolouring is enchanting. It is entirely transparent and seems as if\r\nimpregnated with light: however, his forms, and every thing else,\r\nbespeak the _mannerist_.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNIBALE CARRACCI.\r\n\r\n  N° 721. (Gallery.) _Christ dead on the knees of the Virgin._\r\n\r\n     723. _The Resurrection of Christ._\r\n\r\n     728. _The Nativity of Christ._\r\n\r\n     730. _Christ laid in the tomb._\r\n\r\nOf the CARRACCI, ANNIBALE is the most perfect. He is also remarkable\r\nfor the different manners which he has displayed in his works. They\r\nappear to be by two or three different painters. Of more than twenty\r\nin the Gallery, the above are the best of his productions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL ANGELO DA CARAVAGGIO.\r\n\r\n  N° 744. (Gallery.) _Christ laid in the tomb._\r\n\r\nThis wonderful picture, which was brought from Rome, is, for vigour\r\nof execution and truth of colouring, superior to all the others by\r\nthe same master. Every one of his works bears the stamp of a great\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMENICHINO.\r\n\r\n  N° 763. (Gallery.) _The Communion of St. Jerome._\r\n\r\nThis picture, the master-piece of DOMENICHICO, comes from the great\r\naltar of the church of _San Geronimo della Carità_, at Rome. It will\r\nappear incredible that for a work of such importance, which cost him\r\nso much time, study, and labour, he received no more than the sum of\r\nabout £10 sterling.\r\n\r\n  N° 769. (Gallery.) _St. Cecilia_.\r\n\r\nThis capital performance is now removed to the drawing-room of the\r\nFirst Consul, in the palace of the _Tuileries_.\r\n\r\nAfter RAPHAEL, DOMENICHINO is one of the most perfect masters; and\r\nhis _St. Jerome_, together with RAPHAEL'S Transfiguration, are\r\nreckoned among the most famous _chefs d'oeuvre_ of the art of\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUIDO.\r\n\r\n  N° 797. (Gallery.) _The Crucifixion of St. Peter_.\r\n\r\n     800. _Fortune_.\r\n\r\nThese are the finest of the twenty pictures by that master, now\r\nexhibited in the CENTRAL MUSEUM. They both came from Rome; the\r\nformer, from the Vatican; the latter, from the Capitol.\r\n\r\nGUIDO is a noble and graceful painter; but, in general, he betrays a\r\ncertain negligence in the execution of several parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUINI.\r\n\r\n  N° 860. (Gallery.) _The Holy Family_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this picture, LUINI has fallen little short of his master,\r\nLEONARDO DA VINCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA SOLARIO.\r\n\r\n  N° 896. (Gallery.) _The Daughter of Herodias receiving the head of\r\nSt. John_.\r\n\r\nSOLARIO is another worthy pupil of LEONARDO. This very capital\r\npicture belonged to the collection of the crown, and was purchased by\r\nLewis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERUNO DEL VAGA.\r\n\r\n  N° 928. (Gallery.) _The Muses challenged by the Piërides_.\r\n\r\nAn excellent picture from Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTASSARE PERUZZI.\r\n\r\n  N° 929.

It is not yet\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIETRO DA CORTONA.\r\n\r\n  N° 52. (Saloon.) _The Birth of the Virgin_.\r\n\r\n     53. _Remus and Romulus_.\r\n\r\nThese are the finest pictures in the collection by this master.\r\n\r\nWe have now noticed the best productions of the Italian School: in\r\nour next visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM, I shall point out the most\r\ndistinguished pictures of the French and Flemish Schools.\r\n\r\nP. S. Lord Cornwallis is sumptuously entertained here, all the\r\nministers giving him a grand dinner, each in rotation. After having\r\nviewed the curiosities of Paris, he will, in about a fortnight,\r\nproceed to the congress at Amiens. On his Lordship's arrival, I\r\nthought it my duty to leave my name at his hotel, and was most\r\nagreeably surprised to meet with a very old acquaintance in his\r\nmilitary Secretary, Lieut. Col. L--------s. For any of the\r\nambassador's further proceedings, I refer you to the English\r\nnewspapers, which seem to anticipate all his movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 15, 1801._\r\n\r\nThe more frequently I visit the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, the more\r\nam I inclined to think that such a vast number of pictures, suspended\r\ntogether, lessen each other's effect. This is the first idea which\r\nnow presents itself to me, whenever I enter the\r\n\r\nGALLERY OF THE LOUVRE.\r\n\r\nWere this collection rendered apparently less numerous by being\r\nsubdivided into different apartments, the eye would certainly be less\r\ndazzled than it is, at present, by an assemblage of so many various\r\nobjects, which, though arranged as judiciously as possible, somehow\r\nconvey to the mind an image of confusion. The consequence is that\r\nattention flags, and no single picture is seen to advantage, because\r\nso many are seen together.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the lover of the arts becomes more familiarized with\r\nthe choicest productions of the pencil, he perceives that there are\r\nfew pictures, if any, really faultless. In some, he finds beauties,\r\nwhich are general, or forming, as it were, a whole, and producing a\r\ngeneral effect; in others, he meets with particular or detached\r\nbeauties, whose effect is partial: assembled, they constitute the\r\nbeautiful: insulated, they have a merit which the amateur\r\nappreciates, and the artist ought to study. General or congregated\r\nbeauties always arise from genius and talent: particular or detached\r\nbeauties belong to study, to labour, that is, to the _nulla die sine\r\nlineâ_ and sometimes solely to chance, as is exemplified in the old\r\nstory of Protogenes, the celebrated Rhodian painter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo discover some of these beauties, requires no extraordinary\r\ndiscernment; a person of common observation might decide whether the\r\nfroth at the mouth of an animal, panting for breath, was naturally\r\nrepresented: but a spectator, possessing a cultivated and refined\r\ntaste, minutely surveys every part of a picture, examines the\r\ngrandeur of the composition, the elevation of the ideas, the\r\nnobleness of the expression, the truth and correctness of the design,\r\nthe grace scattered over the different objects, the imitation of\r\nnature in the colouring, and the masterly strokes of the pencil.\r\n\r\nOur last visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM terminated with the Italian\r\nSchool; let us now continue our examination, beginning with the\r\n\r\nFRENCH SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE BRUN.\r\n\r\n  N° 17. _(Gallery) The Defeat of Porus._\r\n\r\n     18. _The Family of Darius at the feet of Alexander._\r\n\r\n     19. _The Entrance of Alexander into Babylon.\r\n         The Passage of the Granicus._\r\n\r\n     14. _Jesus asleep, or Silence._\r\n\r\n     16. _The Crucifix surrounded by angels._\r\n\r\nThe compositions of LE BRUN are grand and rich; his costume\r\nwell-chosen, and tolerably scientific; the tone of his pictures\r\nwell-suited to the subject. But, in this master, we must not look\r\nfor purity and correctness of drawing, in an eminent degree. He much\r\nresembles PIETRO DA CORTONA. LE BRUN, however, has a taste more in\r\nthe style of RAPHAEL and the antique, though it is a distant\r\nimitation. The colouring of PIETRO DA CORTONA is far more agreeable\r\nand more captivating.\r\n\r\nAmong the small pictures by LE BRUN, N°s. 14 and 16 deserve to be\r\ndistinguished; but his _chefs d'oeuvre_ are the achievements of\r\nAlexander. When the plates from these historical paintings, engraved\r\nby AUDRAN, reached Rome, it is related that the Italians, astonished,\r\nexclaimed: \"_Povero Raffaello! non sei più il primo_.\" But, when they\r\nafterwards saw the originals, they restored, to RAPHAEL his former\r\npre-eminence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAUDE LORRAIN.\r\n\r\n  N° 43. (Gallery.) _View of a sea-port at sun-set_.\r\n\r\n     45. _A Sea-piece on a fine morning_.\r\n\r\n     46. _A Landscape enlivened by the setting sun_.\r\n\r\nThe superior merit of CLAUDE in landscape-painting is too well known\r\nto need any eulogium, The three preceding are the finest of his\r\npictures in this collection. However, at Rome, and in England, there\r\nare some more perfect than those in the CENTRAL MUSEUM. One of his\r\n_chefs d'oeuvre_, formerly at Rome, is now at Naples, in the Gallery\r\nof Prince Colonna.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUVENET.\r\n\r\n  N° 54. (Gallery.) _Christ taken down from the cross._\r\n\r\nThe above is the most remarkable picture here by this master.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIGNARD.\r\n\r\n  N° 57. (Gallery.) _The Virgin_, called _La Vièrge à\r\n    la grappe_, because she is taking from a basket of\r\n    fruit a bunch of grapes to present to her son.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOLAS POUSSIN.\r\n\r\n  N° 70. (Gallery.) _The Fall of the manna in the desert._\r\n\r\n     75. _Rebecca and Eleazar._\r\n\r\n     77. _The Judgment of Solomon._\r\n\r\n     78. _The blind Men of Jericho._\r\n\r\n     82. _Winter or the Deluge._\r\n\r\nIn this collection, the above are the finest historical paintings of\r\nPOUSSIN; and of his landscapes, the following deserve to be admired.\r\n\r\n  N° 76. (Gallery.) _Diogenes throwing away his porringer._\r\n\r\n     83. _The Death of Eurydice._\r\n\r\nPOUSSIN is the greatest painter of the French school. His\r\ncompositions bear much resemblance to those of RAPHAEL, and to the\r\nantique: though they have not the same _naïveté_ and truth. His\r\nback-grounds are incomparable; his landscapes, in point of\r\ncomposition, superior even to those of CLAUDE. His large altar-pieces\r\nare the least beautiful of his productions. His feeble colouring\r\ncannot support proportions of the natural size: in these pictures,\r\nthe charms of the background are also wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE SUEUR.\r\n\r\n  N° 98. (Gallery.) _St. Paul preaching at Ephesus._\r\n\r\nThis is the _chef d'oeuvre_ of LE SUEUR, who is to be admired for the\r\nsimplicity of his pencil, as well as for the beauty of his\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENTINO.\r\n\r\n  N° 111. (Gallery.) _The Martyrdom of St. Processa and St.\r\nMartinian._\r\n\r\n     112. _Cæsar's Tribute._\r\n\r\nThese are the finest productions of this master, who was a worthy\r\nrival of CARAVAGGIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERNET.\r\n\r\n  N° 121. (Gallery.) _A Sea-port at sun-set_.\r\n\r\nThis painter's style is generally correct and agreeable. In the above\r\npicture he rivals CLAUDE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the school which, of all others, is best known in\r\nEngland. This exempts me from making any observations on the\r\ncomparative merits of the masters who compose it. I shall therefore\r\nconfine myself to a bare mention of the best of their performances,\r\nat present exhibited in the CENTRAL MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEMISH SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBENS.\r\n\r\n  N° 485. (Gallery.) _St. Francis, dying, receives the sacrament._\r\n\r\n     503. _Christ taken down from the cross_, a celebrated picture\r\nfrom the cathedral of Antwerp.\r\n\r\n     507. _Nicholas Rochox, a burgomaster of the city of Antwerp, and\r\na friend of_ RUBENS.\r\n\r\n     509. _The Crucifixion of St. Peter_.\r\n\r\n     513. _St. Roch interceding for the people attacked by the\r\nplague._\r\n\r\n     526. _The Village-Festival_.\r\n\r\nIn this repository, the above are the most remarkable productions of\r\nRUBENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANDYCK.\r\n\r\n  N° 255. (Gallery.) _The Mother of pity._\r\n\r\n     264. _The portraits of Charles I, elector palatine, and his\r\nbrother, prince Robert._\r\n\r\n     265. _A full-length portrait of a man holding his daughter by\r\nthe hand._\r\n\r\n     266. _A full-length portrait of a lady with her son._\r\n\r\nThese are superior to the other pictures by VANDYCK in this\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n  N° 216. (Gallery.) _The Nuns._\r\n\r\nThe history of this piece is interesting. The eldest daughter of\r\nCHAMPAGNE was a nun in the convent of _Port-Royal_ at Paris. Being\r\nreduced to extremity by a fever of fourteen months' duration, and\r\ngiven over by her physicians, she falls to prayers with another nun,\r\nand recovers her health.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAYER.\r\n\r\n  N° 227.

Six years ago, I understand, the\r\nsubject was agitated, and dropped again, on consideration of the\r\nstate of the country in general, and particularly the finances. It is\r\nnow revived; and I was told the other day, that a plan of\r\nconstruction had absolutely been adopted. This, no doubt, is more\r\neasy than to find the sums of money necessary for carrying on so\r\nexpensive an undertaking.\r\n\r\nIf the fact were true, it is of a nature to produce a great sensation\r\nin modern art, since it is affirmed that the object of this work is\r\nto give a vast display to every article appropriated to general\r\ninstruction; for, according to report, it is intended that these\r\nunited buildings, should, in addition to the National Library,\r\ncontain the collections of statues, pictures, &c. &c. still remaining\r\nat the disposal of the government. I would not undertake to vouch for\r\nthe precise nature of the object proposed; but it cannot be denied\r\nthat, in this project, there is a boldness well calculated to flatter\r\nthe ambition of the Chief Consul.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it more probable that nothing, in this respect, will\r\nbe positively determined in the present state of affairs. The\r\nexpedition to St. Domingo will cost an immense sum, not to speak of\r\nthe restoration of the French navy, which must occasion great and\r\nimmediate calls for money. Whence I conclude that the erection of the\r\nnew Gallery, like that of the National Column, will be much talked\r\nof, but remain among other projects in embryo, and the discussion be\r\nadjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nLeaving the _Great Gallery_, we return to the _Saloon_ of the\r\n_Louvre_, which, being an intermediate apartment, serves as a point\r\nof communication between it and the\r\n\r\nGALLERY OF APOLLO.\r\n\r\nThe old gallery of this name, first called _La petite galérie du\r\nLouvre_, was constructed under the reign of Henry IV, and, from its\r\norigin, ornamented with paintings. This gallery having been consumed\r\nby fire in 1661, owing to the negligence of a workman employed in\r\npreparing a theatre for a grand ballet, in which the king was to\r\ndance with all his court, Lewis XIV immediately ordered it to be\r\nrebuilt and magnificently decorated.\r\n\r\nLE BRUN, who then directed works of this description in France,\r\nfurnished the designs of all the paintings, sculpture, and ornaments,\r\nwhich are partly executed. He divided the vault of the roof into\r\neleven principal compartments; in that which is in the centre, he\r\nintended to represent _Apollo_ in his car, with all the attributes\r\npeculiar to the Sun, which was the king's device. The _Seasons_ were\r\nto have occupied the four nearest compartments; in the others, were\r\nto have been _Evening_ and _Morning_, _Night_ and _Day-break_, the\r\n_Waking of the Waters_, and that of the _Earth at Sun-rise_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his fame, this vast project of LE BRUN was never\r\ncompleted. Lewis XIV, captivated by Versailles, soon turned all his\r\nthoughts towards the embellishment of that palace. The works of the\r\nGALLERY OF APOLLO were entirely abandoned, and, of all this grand\r\ncomposition, LE BRUN was enabled to execute no more than the\r\nfollowing subjects:\r\n\r\n1. _Evening_, represented by Morpheus, lying on a bed of poppies, and\r\nburied in a profound sleep.\r\n\r\n2. _Night_ succeeding to day, and lighted by the silvery disk of the\r\nMoon, which, under the figure of Diana, appears in a car drawn by\r\nhinds.\r\n\r\n3. _The Waking of the Waters_. Neptune and Amphitrite on a car drawn\r\nby sea-horses, and accompanied by Tritons, Nereïds, and other\r\ndivinities of the waters, seem to be paying homage to the rising sun,\r\nwhose first rays dispel the Winds and Tempests, figured by a group to\r\nthe left; while, to the right, Polyphemus, seated on a rock, is\r\ncalling with his loud instrument to his Galatea.\r\n\r\nThe other compartments, which LE BRUN could not paint, on account of\r\nthe cessation of the works, remained a long time vacant, and would\r\nhave been so at this day, had not the _ci-devant_ Academy of\r\nPainting, to whom the king, in 1764, granted the use of the GALLERY\r\nOF APOLLO, resolved that, in future, the historical painters who\r\nmight be admitted members, should be bound to paint for their\r\nreception one of the subjects which were still wanting for the\r\ncompletion of the ceiling. In this manner, five of the compartments,\r\nwhich remained to be filled, were successively decorated, namely:\r\n\r\n1. _Summer_, by DURAMEAU.\r\n\r\n2. _Autumn_, by TARAVAL.\r\n\r\n3. _Spring_, by CALLET.\r\n\r\n4. _Winter_, by LAGRENÉE the younger,\r\n\r\n5. _Morning_, or day-break, by RENOU.\r\n\r\nThe GALLERY OF APOLLO now making part of the CENTRAL MUSEUM, it would\r\nbe worthy of the government to cause its ceiling to be completed, by\r\nhaving the three vacant compartments painted by skillful French\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nUnder the compartments, and immediately above the cornice, are twelve\r\nmedallions, which were to represent the _twelve months of the year_,\r\ncharacterized by the different occupations peculiar to them: eight\r\nonly are executed, and these are the months of summer, autumn, and\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe rich borders in gilt stucco, which serve as frames to all these\r\npaintings, the caryatides which support them, as well as the groups\r\nof Muses, Rivers, and Children, that are distributed over the great\r\ncornice, are worthy of remark. Not only were the most celebrated\r\nsculptors then in France, GASPAR and BALTHAZAR MARSY, REGNAUDIN, and\r\nGIRARDON, chosen to execute them; but their emulation was also\r\nexcited by a premium of three hundred louis, which was promised to\r\nhim who should excel. GIRARDON obtained it by the execution of the\r\nfollowing pieces of sculpture:\r\n\r\n1. The figure representing a river which is under the _Waking of the\r\nWaters_; at the south extremity of the gallery.\r\n\r\n2. The two trophies of arms which are near that river.\r\n\r\n3. The caryatides that support one of the octagonal compartments\r\ntowards the quay, at the foot of which are seen two children; the one\r\narmed with a sickle, the other leaning on a lion.\r\n\r\n4. The group of caryatides that supports the great compartment where\r\n_Summer_ is represented, and below which is a child holding a\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n5. The two grouped figures of Tragedy and Comedy, which rest on the\r\ngreat cornice.\r\n\r\nIn the GALLERY OF APOLLO will be exhibited in succession, about\r\ntwelve thousand original drawings of the Italian, Flemish, and French\r\nschools, the greater part of which formerly belonged to the crown.\r\nThis valuable collection had been successively enriched by the choice\r\nof those of JABAK, LANQUE, MONTARSIS, LE BRUN, CROZAT, MARIETTE, &c.\r\nyet never rendered public. Private and partial admission to it had,\r\nindeed, been granted; but artists and amateurs, in general, were\r\nprecluded from so rich a source of study. By inconceivable neglect,\r\nit seemed almost to have escaped the attention of the old government,\r\nhaving been for a hundred years shut up in a confined place, instead\r\nof being exhibited to public view.\r\n\r\nThe variety of the forms and dimensions of these drawings having\r\nopposed the more preferable mode of arranging them by schools, and in\r\nchronological order, the most capital drawings of each master have\r\nbeen selected (for, in so extensive a collection, it could not be\r\nsupposed that they were all equally interesting); and these even are\r\nsufficiently numerous to furnish several successive exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe present exhibition consists of upwards of two hundred drawings by\r\nthe most distinguished masters of the Italian school, about one\r\nhundred by those of the Flemish, and as many, or rather more, by\r\nthose of the French. They are placed in glazed frames, so contrived\r\nas to admit of the subjects being changed at pleasure. Among the\r\ndrawings by RAPHAEL, is the great cartoon of the Athenian School, a\r\nvaluable fragment which served for the execution of the grand\r\n_fresco_ painting in the Vatican, the largest and finest of all his\r\nproductions. It was brought from the Ambrosian library at Milan, and\r\nis one of the most instructive works extant for a study.\r\n\r\nBesides the drawings, is a frame containing a series of portraits of\r\nillustrious personages who made a figure in the reign of Lewis XIV.\r\nThey are miniatures in enamel, painted chiefly by the celebrated\r\nPETITOT of Geneva.\r\n\r\nHere are also to be seen some busts and antique vases. The most\r\nremarkable of the latter is one of Parian marble, about twenty-one\r\ninches in height by twelve in diameter. It is of an oval form; the\r\nhandles, cut out of the solid stone, are ornamented with four swans'\r\nheads, and the neck with branches of ivy. On the swell is a\r\nbas-relief, sculptured in the old Greek style, and in the centre\r\nis an altar on which these words may be decyphered.\r\n\r\n  [Greek: SOSIBIOS ATÆNAIOS EPOIEI.]\r\n  _Sosibios of Athens fecit._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful vase[2] is placed on a table of violet African\r\nbreccia, remarkable for its size, being twelve feet in length, three\r\nfeet ten inches in breadth, and upwards of three inches in thickness.\r\n\r\nIt might, at first, be supposed that the indiscriminate admission of\r\npersons of all ranks to a Museum, which presents so many attractive\r\nobjects, would create confusion, and occasion breaches of decorum.\r\nBut this is by no means the case. _Savoyards_, _poissardes_, and the\r\nwhole motley assemblage of the lower classes of both sexes in Paris,\r\nbehave themselves with as much propriety as the more refined\r\nvisiters; though their remarks, perhaps, may be expressed in language\r\nless polished. In conspicuous places of the various apartments,\r\nboards are affixed, on which is inscribed the following significant\r\nappeal to the uncultivated mind, \"_Citoyens, ne touchez à rien; mais\r\nrespectez la Propriété Nationale_.\" Proper persons are stationed here\r\nand there to caution such as, through thoughtlessness or ignorance,\r\nmight not attend to the admonition.\r\n\r\nOn the days appropriated to the accommodation of students, great\r\nnumbers are to be seen in different parts of the Museum, some mounted\r\non little stages, others standing or sitting, all sedulously employed\r\nin copying the favourite object of their studies. Indeed, the epithet\r\nCENTRAL has been applied to this establishment, in order to designate\r\na MUSEUM, which is to contain the choicest productions of art, and,\r\nof course, become the _centre_ of study. Here, nothing has been\r\nneglected that could render such an institution useful, either in a\r\npolitical light, or in regard to public instruction. Its magnificence\r\nand splendour speak to every eye, and are calculated to attract the\r\nattention of foreigners from the four quarters of the globe; while,\r\nas a source of improvement, it presents to students the finest models\r\nthat the arts and sciences could assemble. In a philosophical point\r\nof view, such a Museum may be compared to a torch, whose light will\r\nnot only dispel the remnant of that bad taste which, for a century,\r\nhas predominated in the arts dependent on design, but also serve to\r\nguide the future progress of the rising generation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the great _Gallery_ of the _Louvre_ are suspended\r\nabout nine hundred and fifty pictures; which, with ninety in the\r\n_Saloon_, extend the number of the present exhibition to one thousand\r\nand forty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Whatever may be the beauty of this vase, two others are\r\nto be seen in Paris, which surpass it, according to the opinion of\r\none of the most celebrated antiquaries of the age, M. VISCONTI. They\r\nare now in the possession of M. AUBRI, doctor of Physic, residing at\r\nN°. 272, _Rue St. Thomas du Louvre_, but they formerly graced the\r\ncabinet of the _Villa-Albani_ at Rome. In this apartment, Cardinal\r\nAlessandro had assembled some of the most valuable ornaments of\r\nantiquity. Here were to be seen the Apollo _Sauroctonos_ in bronze,\r\nthe Diana in alabaster, and the _unique_ bas-relief of the apothesis\r\nof Hercules. By the side of such rare objects of art, these vases\r\nattracted no less attention. To describe them as they deserve, would\r\nlead me too far; they need only to be seen to be admired. Although\r\ntheir form is antique, the execution of them is modern, and ascribed\r\nto the celebrated sculptor, SILVIO DA VELETRI, who lived in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. Indeed, M. VISCONTI affirms\r\nthat antiquity affords not their equal; assigning as a reason that\r\nporphyry was introduced into Rome at a period when the fine arts were\r\ntending to their decline. Notwithstanding the hardness of the\r\nsubstance, they are executed with such taste and perfection, that the\r\nporphyry is reduced to the thinness of china.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 17, 1801._\r\n\r\nThe _Louvre_, the _Tuileries_, together with the _National Fête_ in\r\nhonour of Peace, and a crowd of interesting objects, have so\r\nengrossed our attention, that we seem to have overlooked the\r\n_ci-devant Palais Royal_. Let us then examine that noted edifice,\r\nwhich now bears the name of\r\n\r\nPALAIS DU TRIBUNAT.\r\n\r\nIn 1629, Cardinal Richelieu began the construction of this palace.\r\nWhen finished, in 1636, he called it the _Palais Cardinal_, a\r\ndenomination which was much criticized, as being unworthy of the\r\nfounder of the French Academy.\r\n\r\nLike the politic Wolsey, who gave Hampton-Court to Henry VIII, the\r\ncrafty Richelieu, in 1639, thought proper to make a present of this\r\npalace to Lewis XIII. After the death of that king, Anne of Austria,\r\nqueen of France and regent of the kingdom, quitted the _Louvre_ to\r\ninhabit the _Palais Cardinal_, with her sons Lewis XIV and the Duke\r\nof Anjou.\r\n\r\nThe first inscription was then removed, and this palace was called\r\n_le Palais Royal_, a name which it preserved till the revolution,\r\nwhen, after the new title assumed by its then owner, it was\r\ndenominated _la Maison Égalité_, till, under the consular government,\r\nsince the Tribunate have here established their sittings, it has\r\nobtained its present appellation of _Palais du Tribunat_.\r\n\r\nIn the sequel, Lewis XIV granted to Monsieur, his only brother,\r\nmarried to Henrietta Stuart, daughter of Charles I, the enjoyment of\r\nthe _Palais Royal_, and afterwards vested the property of it in his\r\ngrandson, the Duke of Chartres.\r\n\r\nThat prince, become Duke of Orleans, and regent of France, during the\r\nminority of Lewis XV, resided in this palace, and (to use Voltaire's\r\nexpression) hence gave the signal of voluptuousness to the whole\r\nkingdom. Here too, he ruled it with principles the most daring;\r\nholding men, in general, in great contempt, and conceiving them to be\r\nall as insidious, as servile, and as covetous as those by whom he was\r\nsurrounded. With the superiority of his character, he made a sport of\r\ngoverning this mass of individuals, as if the task was unworthy of\r\nhis genius. The fact is illustrated by the following anecdote.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of his regency, the debts of the State were\r\nimmense, and the finances exhausted: such great evils required\r\nextraordinary remedies; he wished to persuade the people that\r\npaper-money was better than specie. Thousands became the dupes\r\nof their avarice, and too soon awoke from their dream only to curse\r\nthe authors of a project which ended in their total ruin. It is almost\r\nneedless to mention that I here allude to the Mississippi bubble.\r\n\r\nIn circumstances so critical, the Parliament of Paris thought it\r\ntheir duty to make remonstrances. They accordingly sent deputies to\r\nthe regent, who was persuaded that they wished to stir up the\r\nParisians against him. After having listened to their harangue with\r\nmuch phelgm, he gave them his answer in four words: \"Go and be\r\nd----n'd.\" The deputy, who had addressed him, nothing disconcerted,\r\ninstantly replied: \"Sir, it is the custom of the Parliament to enter\r\nin their registers the answers which they receive from the throne:\r\nshall they insert this?\"\r\n\r\nThe principles of the regent's administration, which succeeded those\r\nof Lewis XIV, form in history, a very striking shade. The French\r\nnation, which, plastic as wax, yields to every impression, was\r\nnew-modelled in a single instant. As a rotten speck, by spreading,\r\ncontaminates the finest fruit, so was the _Palais Royal_ the corrupt\r\nspot, whence the contagion of debauchery was propagated, even to the\r\nremotest parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis period, infinitely curious and interesting, paved the way to the\r\npresent manners. If the basis of morality be at this day overthrown\r\nin France, the regency of Philip of Orleans, by completing what the\r\ndissolute court of Lewis XIV had begun, has occasioned that rapid\r\nchange, whose influence was felt long before the revolution, and\r\nwill, in all probability, last for ages. At least, I think that such\r\na conclusion is exemplified by what has occurred in England since the\r\nprofligate reign of Charles II, the effects of whose example have\r\nnever been done away.\r\n\r\nDifferent circumstances have produced considerable alterations in\r\nthis palace, so that, at the present day, its numerous buildings\r\npreserve of the first architect, LE MERCIER, no more than a small\r\npart of the second court.\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance of the _Palais du Tribunat_ is from the _Rue\r\nSt. Honoré_. The façade, on this side, which was constructed in 1763,\r\nconsists of two pavilions, ornamented by Doric and Ionic pillars, and\r\nconnected by a lofty stone-wall, perforated with arches, to three\r\ngrand gates, by which you enter the first court. Here, two elegant\r\nwings present themselves, decorated with pilasters, also of the Doric\r\nand Ionic orders, which are likewise employed for the pillars of the\r\navant-corps in the centre. This avant-corps is pierced with three\r\narches, which serve as a passage into the second court, and\r\ncorrespond with the three gates before-mentioned.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the vestibule, between the two courts, where large\r\nDoric pillars rise, though partly concealed by a number of little\r\nshops and stalls, you see, on the right, the handsome elliptical\r\nstair-case, which leads to the apartments. It branches off into two\r\ndivisions at the third step, and is lighted by a lofty dome. The\r\nbalustrade of polished iron is beautiful, and is said to have cost\r\nthirty-two workmen two years' labour. Before the revolution,\r\nstrangers repaired hither to admire the cabinet of gems and engraved\r\nstones, the cabinet of natural history, the collection of models of\r\narts, trades, and manufactures, and the famous collection of\r\npictures, belonging to the _last_ duke of Orleans, and chiefly\r\nassembled, at a vast expense, by his grandfather, the regent.\r\n\r\nThis second court is larger than the first; but it still remains in\r\nan incomplete state. The right-hand wing only is finished, and is\r\nmerely a continuation of that which we have seen in the other court.\r\nOn the left hand, is the site of the new hall intended for the\r\nsittings of the Tribunate. Workmen are now employed in its\r\nconstruction; heaps of stones and mortar are lying about, and, the\r\nbuilding seems to proceed with tolerable expedition. Here, in the\r\nback-ground, is a crowd of little stalls for the sale of various\r\narticles, such as prints, plays, fruit, and pastry. In front stand\r\nsuch carriages as remain in waiting for those who may have been set\r\ndown at this end of the palace. Proceeding onward, you pass through\r\ntwo parallel wooden galleries, lined on each side with shops, and\r\nenter the formerly-enchanting regions of the\r\n\r\nJARDIN DU PALAIS DU TRIBUNAT.\r\n\r\nThe old garden of the _Palais Royal_, long famous for its shady\r\nwalks, and for being the most fashionable public promenade in Paris,\r\nhad, from its centrical situation, gradually attracted to its\r\nvicinity a considerable number of speculators, who there opened\r\nready-furnished hotels, coffee-houses, and shops of various\r\ndescriptions. The success of these different establishments awakened\r\nthe cupidity of its wealthy proprietor, then Duke, of Chartres, who,\r\nconceiving that the ground might be made to yield a capital\r\naugmentation to his income, fixed on a plan for enclosing it by a\r\nmagnificent range of buildings.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the clamours of the Parisian public, who, from long\r\nhabit, considered that they had a sort of prescriptive right to this\r\nfavourite promenade, the axe was laid to the celebrated _arbre de\r\nCracovie_ and other venerable trees, and their stately heads were\r\nsoon levelled to the ground. Every one murmured as if these trees had\r\nbeen his own private property, and cut down against his will and\r\npleasure. This will not appear extraordinary, when it is considered\r\nthat, under their wide-spreading branches, which afforded a shelter\r\nimpervious to the sun and rain, politicians by day, adjusted the\r\nbalance of power, and arbiters of taste discussed the fashions of the\r\nmoment; while, by night, they presented a canopy, beneath which were\r\noften arranged the clandestine bargains of opera-girls and other\r\nvotaries of Venus.\r\n\r\nAfter venting their spleen in vague conjectures, witty epigrams, and\r\nlampoons, the Parisians were silent. They presently found that they\r\nwere, in general, not likely to be losers by this devastation. In\r\n1782, the execution of the new plan was begun: in less than three\r\nyears, the present inclosure was nearly completed, and the modern\r\ngarden thrown open to the public, uniting to the advantages of the\r\nancient one, a thousand others more refined and concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe form of this garden is a parallelogram, whose length is seven\r\nhundred and two feet by three hundred in breadth, taken at its\r\ngreatest dimensions. It is bordered, on three of its sides, by new,\r\nuniform buildings, of light and elegant architecture. Rising to an\r\nelevation of forty-two feet, these buildings present two regular\r\nstories, exclusively of the _mansarde_, or attic story, decorated by\r\nfestoons, bas-reliefs, and large Composite fluted pillars, bearing an\r\nentablature in whose frieze windows are pierced. Throughout its\r\nextent, the whole edifice is crowned by a balustrade, on the\r\npedestals of which vases are placed at equal distances.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the garden stood a most singular building, partly\r\nsubterraneous, called a _Cirque_. This circus, which was first opened\r\nin 1789, with concerts, balls, &c. was also appropriated to more\r\nuseful objects, and, in 1792, a _Lyceum of Arts_ was here\r\nestablished; but in 1797, it was consumed by fire, and its site is\r\nnow occupied by a grass-plot. On the two long sides of the garden are\r\nplanted three rows of horse-chesnut trees, not yet of sufficient\r\ngrowth to afford any shade; and what is new, is a few shrubs and\r\nflowers in inclosed compartments. The walks are of gravel, and kept\r\nin good order.\r\n\r\nOn the ground-floor, a covered gallery runs entirely round the\r\ngarden. The shops, &c. on this floor, as well as the apartments of\r\nthe _entresol_ above them, receive light by one hundred and eighty\r\nporticoes, which are open towards the garden, and used to have each a\r\nglass lantern, with reflectors, suspended in the middle of their\r\narch. In lieu of these, some of a less brilliant description are now\r\ndistributed on a more economical plan under the piazzas; but, at the\r\nclose of day, the rivalship of the shopkeepers, in displaying their\r\nvarious commodities, creates a blaze of light which would strike a\r\nstranger as the effect of an illumination.\r\n\r\nThe fourth side of the garden towards the _Rue St. Honoré_ is still\r\noccupied by a double gallery, constructed, as I have already\r\nmentioned, of wood, which has subsisted nearly in its present state\r\never since I first visited Paris in 1784. It was to have been\r\nreplaced by a colonnade for the inclosure of the two courts. This\r\ncolonnade was to have consisted of six rows of Doric pillars,\r\nsupporting a spacious picture-gallery, (intended for the whole of the\r\nOrleans collection), which was to have constituted the fourth façade\r\nto the garden, and have formed a covered walk, communicating with the\r\ngalleries of the other three sides.\r\n\r\nThese galleries, whose whole circumference measures upwards of a\r\nthird of a mile, afford to the public, even in bad weather, a walk\r\nequally agreeable and convenient, embellished, on the one side, by\r\nthe aspect of the garden, and, on the other, by the studied display\r\nof every thing that taste and fashion can invent to captivate the\r\nattention of passengers.\r\n\r\nNo place in Paris, however, exhibits such a contrast to its former\r\nattractions as this once-fashionable rendezvous. The change of its\r\nname from _Palais Royal_ to _Maison Égalité_ conveys not to the\r\nimagination a dissimilitude more glaring than is observable between\r\nthe present frequenters of this favourite promenade, and those who\r\nwere in the habit of flocking hither before the revolution.\r\n\r\nAt that period, the scene was enlivened by the most brilliant and\r\nmost captivating company in the capital, both in point of exterior\r\nand manners. At this day, the medal is exactly reversed. In lieu of\r\nwell-dressed or well-behaved persons of both sexes, this garden,\r\nincluding its purlieus, presents, morning and evening, nothing but\r\nhordes of stock-jobbers, money-brokers, gamblers, and adventurers of\r\nevery description. The females who frequent it, correspond nearly to\r\nthe character of the men; they are, for the greater part, of the most\r\ndebauched and abandoned class: for a Laïs of _bon ton_ seldom\r\nventures to shew herself among this medley of miscreants.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd, may be occasionally remarked a few strangers attracted\r\nby curiosity, and other individuals of respectable appearance called\r\nhither on business, as well as some inoffensive newsmongers,\r\nresorting to the coffee-houses to read the papers. But, in general,\r\nthe great majority, of the company, now seen here, is of a cast so\r\nextremely low, that no decent woman, whether married or single,\r\nthinks of appearing in a place where she would run a risk of being\r\nput out of countenance in passing alone, even in the daytime. In the\r\nevening, the company is of a still worse complexion; and the\r\nconcourse becomes so great under the piazzas, particularly when the\r\ninclemency of the weather drives people out of the garden, that it is\r\nsometimes difficult to cross through the motley assemblage. At the\r\nconclusion of the performances in the neighbouring theatres, there is\r\na vast accession of the inferior order of nymphs of the Cyprian\r\ncorps; and then, amorous conversation and dalliance reach the summit\r\nof licentious freedom.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the political commotions which have, at different\r\ntimes, convulsed Paris, took their rise in the _ci-devant Palais\r\nRoyal_, or it has, in some shape, been their theatre. In this palace\r\ntoo originated the dreadful reverse of fortune which the queen\r\nexperienced; and, indeed, when the cart in which her majesty was\r\ncarried to the scaffold, passed before the gates of this edifice, she\r\nwas unable to repress a sign of indignation.\r\n\r\nAll writers who have spoken of the inveterate hatred, which existed\r\nbetween the queen and M. d'Orléans, have ascribed it to despised\r\nlove, whose pangs, as Shakspeare tells, us, are not patiently\r\nendured. Some insist that the duke, enamoured of the charms of the\r\nqueen, hazarded a declaration, which her majesty not only received\r\nwith disdain, but threatened to inform the king of in case of a\r\nrenewal of his addresses. Others affirm that the queen, at one time,\r\nshewed that the duke was not indifferent to her, and that, on a hint\r\nbeing given to him to that effect, he replied: \"Every one may be\r\nambitious to please the queen, except myself. Our interests are too\r\nopposite for Love ever to unite them.\" On this foundation is built\r\nthe origin of the animosity which, in the end, brought both these\r\ngreat personages to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the motive which gave rise to it, certain it\r\nis that they never omitted any opportunity of persecuting each other.\r\nThe queen had no difficulty in pourtraying the duke as a man addicted\r\nto the most profligate excesses, and in alienating from him the mind\r\nof the king: he, on his side, found it as easy, by means of\r\nsurreptitious publications, to represent her as a woman given to\r\nillicit enjoyments; so that, long before the revolution, the\r\ncharacter both of the queen and the duke were well known to the\r\npublic; and their example tended not a little to increase the general\r\ndissoluteness of morals. The debaucheries of the one served as a\r\nmodel to all the young rakes of fashion; while the levity of the\r\nother, was imitated by what were termed the _amiable_ women of the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nAfter his exile in 1788, the hatred of M. d'Orléans towards the queen\r\nroused that ambition which he inherited from his ancestors. In\r\nwatching her private conduct, in order to expose her criminal\r\nweaknesses, he discovered a certain political project, which gave\r\nbirth to the idea of his forming a plan of a widely-different nature.\r\nHitherto he had given himself little trouble about State affairs;\r\nbut, in conjunction with his confidential friends, he now began to\r\ncalculate the means of profiting by the distress of his country.\r\n\r\nThe first shocks of the revolution had so electrified the greater\r\npart of the Parisians, that, in regard to the Duke of Orleans, they\r\nimperceptibly passed from profound contempt to blind infatuation. His\r\npalace became the rendezvous of all the malcontents of the court, and\r\nhis garden the place of assembly of all the demagogues. His exile\r\nappeared a public calamity, and his recall was celebrated as a\r\ntriumph. Had he possessed a vigour of intellect, and a daring equal\r\nto the situation of leader of a party, there is little doubt that he\r\nmight have succeeded in his plan, and been declared regent. His\r\nimmense income, amounting to upwards of three hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling, was employed to gain partisans, and secure the attachment\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of the Bastille, it is admitted that his party was\r\nsufficiently powerful to effect a revolution in his favour; but his\r\npusillanimity prevailed over his ambition. The active vigilance of\r\nthe queen thwarting his projects, he resolved to get rid of her; and\r\nin that intention was the irruption of the populace directed to\r\nVersailles. This fact seems proved: for, on some one complaining\r\nbefore him in 1792, that the revolution proceeded too slowly. \"It\r\nwould have been terminated long ago,\" replied he, \"had the queen been\r\nsacrificed on the 5th of October 1789.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months before the fall of the throne, M. d'Orléans still reckoned\r\nto be able to attain his wishes; but he soon found himself\r\negregiously mistaken. The factions, after mutually accusing each\r\nother of having him for their chief, ended by deserting him; and,\r\nafter the death of the king, he became a stranger to repose, and, for\r\nthe second time, an object of contempt. The necessity of keeping up\r\nthe exaltation of the people, had exhausted his fortune, great as it\r\nwas; and want of money daily detached different agents from his\r\nparty. His plate, his pictures, his furniture, his books, his\r\ntrinkets, his gems, all went to purchase the favour, and at length\r\nthe protection, of the Maratists. Not having it in his power to\r\nsatisfy their cupidity, he opened loans on all sides, and granted\r\nillusory mortgages. Having nothing more left to dispose of, he was\r\nreduced, as a last resource, to sell his body-linen. In this very\r\nbargain was he engaged, when he was apprehended and sent to\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nAlthough acquitted by the criminal tribunal, before which he was\r\ntried in the south of France, he was still detained there in prison.\r\nAt first, he had shed tears, and given himself up to despair, but now\r\nhope once more revived his spirits, and he availed himself of the\r\nindulgence granted him, by giving way to his old habits of\r\ndebauchery. On being brought to Paris after six months' confinement,\r\nhe flattered himself that he should experience the same lenity in the\r\ncapital. The jailer of the _Conciergerie,_ not knowing whether M.\r\nd'Orléans would leave that prison to ascend the throne or the\r\nscaffold, treated him with particular respect; and he himself was\r\nimpressed with the idea that he would soon resume an ascendency in\r\npublic affairs. But, on his second trial, he was unanimously declared\r\nguilty of conspiring against the unity and indivisibility of the\r\nRepublic, and condemned to die, though no proof whatever of his guilt\r\nwas produced to the jury. One interrogatory put to him is deserving\r\nof notice. It was this: \"Did you not one day say to a deputy: _What\r\nwill you ask of me when I am king?_ And did not the deputy reply: _I\r\nwill ask you for a pistol to blow out your brains?_\"\r\n\r\nEvery one who was present at the condemnation of M. d'Orléans, and\r\nsaw him led to the guillotine affirms that if he never shewed courage\r\nbefore, he did at least on that day. On hearing the sentence, he\r\ncalled out: \"Let it be executed directly.\" From the revolutionary\r\ntribunal he was conducted straight to the scaffold, where,\r\nnotwithstanding the reproaches and imprecations which accompanied him\r\nall the way, he met his fate with unshaken firmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 18, 1801._\r\n\r\nBut if the _ci-devant Palais Royal_ has been the mine of political\r\nexplosions, so it still continues to be the epitome of all the trades\r\nin Paris. Under the arcades, on the ground-floor, here are, as\r\nformerly, shops of jewellers, haberdashers, artificial florists,\r\nmilliners, perfumers, print-sellers, engravers, tailors, shoemakers,\r\nhatters, furriers, glovers, confectioners, provision-merchants,\r\nwoollen-drapers, mercers, cutlers, toymen, money-changers, and\r\nbooksellers, together with several coffee-houses, and\r\nlottery-offices, all in miscellaneous succession.\r\n\r\nAmong this enumeration, the jewellers' shops are the most attractive\r\nin point of splendour. The name of the proprietor is displayed in\r\nlarge letters of artificial diamonds, in a conspicuous compartment\r\nfacing the door. This is a sort of signature, whose brilliancy\r\neclipses all other names, and really dazzles the eyes of the\r\nspectators. But at the same time it draws the attention both of the\r\nlearned and the illiterate: I will venture to affirm that the name of\r\none of these jewellers is more frequently spelt and pronounced than\r\nthat of any great man recorded in history, either ancient or modern.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the price of the commodities exposed for sale in the\r\n_Palais du Tribunat_, it is much the same as in _Bond Street_, you\r\npay one third at least for the idea of fashion annexed to the name of\r\nthe place where you make the purchase, though the quality of the\r\narticle may be nowise superior to what you might procure elsewhere.\r\nAs in Bond Street too, the rents in this building are high, on which\r\naccount the shopkeepers are, in some measure, obliged to charge\r\nhigher than those in other parts of the town. Not but I must do them\r\nthe justice to acknowledge that they make no scruple to avail\r\nthemselves of every prejudice formerly entertained in favour of this\r\ngrand emporium, in regard to taste, novelty, &c. by a still further\r\nincrease of their prices. No small advantage to the shopkeepers\r\nestablished here is the chance custom, arising from such a variety of\r\ntrades being collected together so conveniently, all within the same\r\ninclosure. A person resorting hither to procure one thing, is sure to\r\nbe reminded of some other want, which, had not the article presented\r\nitself to his eye, would probably have escaped his recollection; and,\r\nindeed, such is the thirst of gain, that several tradesmen keep a\r\nsmall shop under these piazzas, independently of a large warehouse in\r\nanother quarter of Paris.\r\n\r\nPamphlets and other ephemeral productions usually make their first\r\nappearance in the _Palais du Tribunat_; and strangers may rely on\r\nbeing plagued by a set of fellows who here hawk about prohibited\r\npublications, of the most immoral tendency, embellished with\r\ncorrespondent engravings; such as _Justine, ou les malheurs de la\r\nvertu, Les quarante manières, &c._ They seldom, I am told, carry the\r\npublication about them, for fear of being unexpectedly apprehended,\r\nbut keep it at some secret repository hard by, whence they fetch it\r\nin an instant. It is curious to see with what adroitness these\r\nvagrants elude the vigilance of the police, I had scarcely set my\r\nfoot in this building before a Jew-looking fellow, coming close to\r\nme, whispered in my ear: \"_Monsieur veut-il la vie polissonne de\r\nMadame--------?_\" Madame who do you think? You will stare when I tell\r\nyou to fill up the blank with the name of her who is now become the\r\nfirst female personage in France? I turned round with astonishment;\r\nbut the ambulating book-vender had vanished, in consequence, as I\r\nconclude, of being observed by some _mouchard._ Thus, what little\r\nvirtue may remain in the mind of youth is contaminated by precept, as\r\nwell as example; and the rising generation is in a fair way of being\r\neven more corrupted than that which has preceded it.\r\n\r\n  \"_Ætas parentum, pejor avis, tulit\r\n    Nos nequiores, mox daturos\r\n      Progeniem vitiosiorem._\"\r\n\r\nBesides the shops, are some auction-rooms, where you may find any\r\narticle of wearing apparel or household furniture, from a lady's wig\r\n_à la Caraculla_ to a bed _à la Grecque:_ here are as many puffers as\r\nin a mock auction in London; and should you be tempted to bid, by the\r\napparent cheapness of the object put up for sale, it is fifty to one\r\nthat you soon repent of your bargain. Not so with the _magazins de\r\nconfiance à prix fixé_, where are displayed a variety of articles,\r\nmarked at a fixed price, from which there is no abatement.\r\n\r\nThese establishments are extremely convenient, not only to ingenious\r\nmechanics, who have invented or improved a particular production of\r\nart, of which they wish to dispose, but also to purchasers. You walk\r\nin, and if any article strikes your fancy, you examine it at your\r\nease; you consider the materials, the workmanship, and lastly the\r\nprice, without being hurried by a loquacious shopkeeper into a\r\npurchase which you may shortly regret. A commission of from five to\r\none half per cent, in graduated proportions, according to the value\r\nof the article, is charged to the seller, for warehouse-room and all\r\nother expenses.\r\n\r\nSuch is the arrangement of the ground-floor; the apartments on the\r\nfirst floor are at present occupied by _restaurateurs_, exhibitions\r\nof various kinds, billiard-tables, and _académies de jeu_, or public\r\ngaming-tables, where all the passions are let loose, and all the\r\ntorments of hell assembled.\r\n\r\nThe second story is let out in lodgings, furnished or unfurnished, to\r\npersons of different descriptions, particularly to the priestesses of\r\nVenus. The rooms above, termed _mansardes_, in the French\r\narchitectural dialect, are mostly inhabited by old batchelors, who\r\nprefer economy to show; or by artists, who subsist by the employment\r\nof their talents. These chambers are spacious, and though the\r\nceilings are low, they receive a more uninterrupted circulation of\r\nfresh air, than the less exalted regions.\r\n\r\nOver the _mansardes_, in the very roof, are nests of little rooms, or\r\ncock-lofts, resembling, I am told, the cells of a beehive. Journeymen\r\nshopkeepers, domestics, and distressed females are said to be the\r\nprincipal occupiers of these aërial abodes.\r\n\r\nI had nearly forgot to mention a species of apartment little known in\r\nEngland: I mean the _entresol_, which is what we should denominate a\r\nlow story, (though here not so considered), immediately above the\r\nground-floor, and directly under the first-floor. In this building,\r\nsome of the _entresols_ are inhabited by the shopkeepers below; some,\r\nby women of no equivocal calling, who throw out their lures to the\r\nidle youths sauntering under the arcades; and others again are now\r\nbecome _maisons de pret_, where pawnbrokers exercise their usurious\r\ndealings.\r\n\r\nIn the _Palais du Tribunat_, as you may remark, not an inch of space\r\nis lost; every hole and corner being turned to account: here and\r\nthere, the cellars even: are converted into scenes of gaiety and\r\ndiversion, where the master of the house entertains his customers\r\nwith a succession of vocal and instrumental music, while they are\r\ntaking such refreshments as he furnishes.\r\n\r\nThis speculation, which has, by all accounts, proved extremely\r\nprofitable, was introduced in the early part of the revolution. Since\r\nthat period, other speculations, engendered by the luxury of the\r\ntimes, have been set on foot within the precincts of this palace. Of\r\ntwo of these, now in full vigour and exercise, I must say a few\r\nwords, as they are of a nature somewhat curious.\r\n\r\nThe one is a _cabinet de décrotteur_, where the art of blacking shoes\r\nis carried to a pitch of perfection hitherto unknown in this country.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, it was common, in Paris, to see counsellors,\r\nabbés, and military officers, as well as _petits-maîtres_ of every\r\ndenomination, full dressed, that is, with their hat under their arm,\r\ntheir sword by their side, and their hair in a bag, standing in the\r\nopen street, with one leg cocked up on a stool, while a rough\r\nSavoyard or Auvergnat hastily cleaned their shoes with a coarse\r\nmixture of lamp-black and rancid oil. At the present day, the\r\n_décrotteurs_ or shoe-blacks still exercise their profession on the\r\n_Pont Neuf_ and in other quarters; but, as a refinement of the art,\r\nthere is also opened, at each of the principal entrances of the\r\n_Palais du Tribunat_, a _cabinet de décrotteur_, or small apartment,\r\nwhere you are invited to take a chair, and presented with the daily\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nThe artist, with due care and expedition, first removes the dirt from\r\nyour shoes or boots with a sponge occasionally moistened in water,\r\nand by means of several pencils, of different sizes, not unlike those\r\nof a limner, he then covers them with a jetty varnish, rivaling even\r\njapan in lustre. This operation he performs with a gravity and\r\nconsequence that can scarcely fail to excite laughter. Yet, according\r\nto the trite proverb, it is not the customer who ought to indulge in\r\nmirth, but the _artist_. Although his price is much dearer than that\r\ndemanded by the other professors of this art, his cabinet is seldom\r\nempty from morning to night; and, by a simple calculation, his pencil\r\nis found to produce more than that of some good painters of the\r\nmodern French school.\r\n\r\nAt the first view of the matter, it should appear that the other\r\nspeculation might have been hit on by any man with a nose to his\r\nface; but, on more mature consideration, one is induced to think that\r\nits author was a person of some learning, and well read in ancient\r\nhistory. He, no doubt, took the hint from VESPASIAN. As that emperor\r\nblushed not to make the urine of the citizens of Rome a source of\r\nrevenue, so the learned projector in question rightly judged that, in\r\na place of such resort as the _Palais du Tribunat_, he might, without\r\nshame or reproach, levy a small tax on the Parisians, by providing\r\nfor their convenience in a way somewhat analogous. His penetration is\r\nnot unhandsomely rewarded; for he derives an income of 12,000 francs,\r\nor £500 sterling, from his _cabinets d'aisance_.\r\n\r\nSince political causes first occasioned the shuting up of the old\r\n_Théâtre Français_ in the _Faubourg St. Germain_, now reduced to a\r\nshell by fire, Melpomene and Thalia have taken up their abode in the\r\nsouth-west angle of the _Palais du Tribunat_, and in its north-west\r\ncorner is another theatre, on a smaller scale, where Momus holds his\r\ncourt; so that be you seriously, sentimentally, or humorously\r\ndisposed, you may, without quitting the shelter of the piazzas,\r\nsatisfy your inclination. Tragedy, Comedy, and Farce all lie before\r\nyou within the purlieus of this extraordinary edifice.\r\n\r\nTo sum up all the conveniences of the _Palais du Tribunat_, suffice\r\nit to say, that almost every want, natural or artificial, almost\r\nevery appetite, gross or refined, might be gratified without passing\r\nits limits; for, while the extravagant voluptuary is indulging in all\r\nthe splendour of Asiatic luxury, the parsimonious sensualist need not\r\ndepart unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the middle of Paris, the _Palais du Tribunat_ has been\r\naptly compared to a sink of vice, whose contagious effects would\r\nthreaten society with the greatest evils, were not the scandalous\r\nscenes of the capital here concentrated into one focus. It has also\r\nbeen mentioned, by the same writer, Mercier, as particularly worthy\r\nof remark, that, since this building is become a grand theatre, where\r\ncupidity, gluttony, and licentiousness shew themselves under every\r\nform and excess, several other quarters of Paris are, in a manner,\r\npurified by the accumulation of vices which flourish in its centre.\r\n\r\nWhether or not this assertion be strictly correct, I will not pretend\r\nto determine: but, certain it is that the _Palais du Tribunat_ is a\r\nvortex of dissipation where many a youth is ingulfed. The natural\r\nmanner in which this may happen I shall endeavour briefly to explain,\r\nby way of conclusion to this letter.\r\n\r\nA young Frenchman, a perfect stranger in Paris, arrives there from\r\nthe country, and, wishing to equip himself in the fashion, hastens to\r\nthe _Palais du Tribunat_, where he finds wearing apparel of every\r\ndescription on the _ground-floor_: prompted by a keen appetite, he\r\ndines at a _restaurateur's_ on the _first-floor_: after dinner, urged\r\nby mere curiosity, perhaps, if not decoyed by some sharper on the\r\nlook-out for novices, he visits a public gaming-table on the same\r\nstory. Fortune not smiling on him, he retires; but, at that very\r\nmoment, he meets, on the landing-place, a captivating damsel, who,\r\nlike Virgil's Galatea, flies to be pursued; and the inexperienced\r\nyouth, after ascending another flight of stairs, is, on the\r\n_second-floor_, ushered into a brothel. Cloyed or disgusted there,\r\nhe is again induced to try the humour of the fickle goddess, and\r\nrepairs once more to the gaming-table, till, having lost all his\r\nmoney, he is under the necessity of descending to the _entresol_\r\nto pawn his watch, before he can even procure a lodging in a\r\n_garret_ above.\r\n\r\nWhat other city in Europe can boast of such an assemblage of\r\naccommodation? Here, under the same roof, a man is, in the space of a\r\nfew minutes, as perfectly equipped from top to toe, as if he had all\r\nthe first tradesmen in London at his command; and shortly after,\r\nwithout setting his foot into the street, he is as completely\r\nstripped, as if he had fallen into the hands of a gang of robbers.\r\n\r\nTo cleanse this Augæan stable, would, no doubt, be a Herculean\r\nlabour. For that purpose, Merlin (of Douay), when Minister of the\r\npolice, proposed to the Directory to convert the whole of the\r\nbuildings of the _ci-devant Palais Royal_ into barracks. This was\r\ncertainly striking at the root of the evil; but, probably, so bold a\r\nproject was rejected, lest its execution, in those critical times,\r\nshould excite the profligate Parisians to insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 20, 1801._\r\n\r\nOne of the private entertainments here in great vogue, and which is\r\nunderstood to mark a certain pre-eminence in the _savoir-vivre_ of\r\nthe present day, is a nocturnal repast distinguished by the\r\ninsignificant denomination of a\r\n\r\nTHÉ.\r\n\r\nA stranger might, in all probability, be led to suppose that he was\r\ninvited to a tea-drinking party, when he receives a note couched in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n_\"Madame R------ prie Monsieur B--------- de lui faire l'honneur de\r\nvenir au thé quelle doit donner le 5 de ce mois.\"_\r\n\r\nConsidering in that light a similar invitation which I received, I\r\nwas just on the point of sending an apology, when I was informed that\r\na _thé_ was nothing more or less than a sort of rout, followed by\r\nsubstantial refreshments, and generally commencing after the\r\nevening's performance was ended at the principal theatres.\r\n\r\nOn coming out of the opera-house then the other night, I repaired to\r\nthe lady's residence in question, and arriving there about twelve\r\no'clock, found that I had stumbled on the proper hour. As usual,\r\nthere were cards, but for those only disposed to play; for, as this\r\nlady happened not to be under the necessity of recurring to the\r\n_bouillotte_ as a financial resource, she gave herself little or no\r\nconcern about the card-tables. Being herself a very agreeable,\r\nsprightly woman, she had invited a number of persons of both sexes of\r\nher own character, so that the conversation was kept up with infinite\r\nvivacity till past one o'clock, when tea and coffee were introduced.\r\nThese were immediately followed by jellies, sandwiches, pâtés, and a\r\nvariety of savoury viands, in the style of a cold supper, together\r\nwith different sorts of wines and liqueurs. In the opinion of some of\r\nthe Parisian sybarites, however, no _thé_ can be complete without the\r\naddition of an article, which is here conceived to be a perfect\r\nimitation of fashionable English cheer. This is hot punch.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to refuse the cheerful and engaging _dame du\r\nlogis_ to taste her _ponche_, and, in compliment to me as an\r\nEnglishman, she presented me with a glass containing at least a\r\ntreble allowance. Not being overfond of punch, I would willingly have\r\nrelinquished the honour of drinking her health in so large a portion,\r\napprehending that this beverage might, in quality, resemble that of\r\nthe same name which I had tasted here a few evenings ago in one of\r\nthe principal coffeehouses. The latter, in fact, was a composition of\r\nnew rum, which reminded me of the trash of that kind distilled in New\r\nEngland, acidulated with rotten lemons, sweetened with capillaire,\r\nand increased by a _quantum sufficit_ of warm water. My hostess's\r\npunch, on the contrary, was made of the best ingredients, agreeably\r\nto the true standard; in a word, it was proper lady's punch, that is,\r\nhot, sweet, sour, and strong. It was distributed in tea-pots, of\r\nbeautiful porcelaine, which, independently of keeping it longer warm,\r\nwere extremely convenient for pouring it out without spilling. Thus\r\nconcluded the entertainment.\r\n\r\nAbout half past two o'clock the party broke up, and I returned home,\r\nsincerely regretting the change in the mode of life of the Parisians.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the fashionable hour of dinner in Paris was\r\nthree o'clock, or at latest four: public places then began early; the\r\ncurtain at the grand French opera drew up at a quarter past five. At\r\nthe present day, the workman dines at two; the tradesman, at three;\r\nthe clerk in a public office, at four; the rich upstart, the\r\nmoney-broker, the stock-jobber, the contractor, at five; the banker,\r\nthe legislator, the counsellor of state, at six; and the ministers,\r\nin general, at seven, nay not unfrequently at eight.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when the performance at the opera, and the other principal\r\ntheatres, was ended at nine o'clock, or a quarter past, people of\r\nfashion supped at ten or half after; and a man who went much into\r\npublic, and kept good company, might retire peaceably to rest by\r\nmidnight. In three-fourths of the houses in Paris, there is now no\r\nsuch meal as supper, except on the occasion of a ball, when it is\r\ngenerally a mere scramble. This, I presume, is one reason why\r\nsubstantial breakfasts are so much in fashion.\r\n\r\n\"_Déjeûners froids et chauds_,\" is an inscription which now generally\r\nfigures on the exterior of a Parisian coffeehouse, beside that of\r\n\"_Thé à l'Anglaise, Café à la crême, Limonade, &c_.\" Solids are here\r\nthe taste of the times. Two ladies, who very gallantly invited\r\nthemselves to breakfast at my apartments the other morning, were\r\nready to turn the house out of the window, when they found that I\r\npresented to them nothing more than tea, coffee, and chocolate. I was\r\ninstantly obliged to provide cold fowl, ham, oysters, white wine, &c.\r\nI marvel not at the strength and vigour of these French belles. In\r\nappetite, they would cope with an English ploughman, who had just\r\nturned up an acre of wholesome land on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nNow, though a _thé_ may be considered as a substitute for a supper,\r\nit cannot, in point of agreeableness, be compared to a _petit\r\nsouper_. If a man must sup, and I am no advocate for regular suppers,\r\nthese were the suppers to my fancy. A select number of persons, well\r\nassorted, assembled at ten o'clock, after the opera was concluded,\r\nand spent a couple of hours in a rational manner. Sometimes a _petit\r\nsouper_ consisted of a simple _tête-à-tête_, sometimes of a _partie\r\nquarrée_, or the number was varied at pleasure. But still, in a\r\n_petit souper_, not only much gaiety commonly prevailed, but also a\r\ncertain _épanchement de coeur_, which animated the conversation to\r\nsuch a degree as to render a party of this description the _acme_ of\r\nsocial intercourse, \"the feast of reason and the flow of soul.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_, not a man was there in office, from the\r\n_ministre d'état_ to the _commis_, who did not think of making\r\nhimself amends for the fatigues of the morning by a _petit souper_:\r\nthese _petits soupers_, however, were, in latter times, carried to an\r\nexcessive pitch of luxurious extravagance. But for refinements\r\nattempted in luxury, though, I confess, of a somewhat dissolute\r\nnature, our countryman eclipsed all the French _bons vivans_ in\r\noriginality of conception.\r\n\r\nBeing in possession of an ample fortune, and willing to enjoy it\r\naccording to his fancy, he purchased in Paris a magnificent house,\r\nbut constructed on a small scale, where every thing that the most\r\nrefined luxury could suggest was assembled. The following is the\r\naccount given by one of his friends, who had been an eye-witness to\r\nhis manner of living.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. B---- had made it a rule to gratify his five senses to the\r\nhighest degree of enjoyment of which they were susceptible. An\r\nexquisite table, perfumed apartments, the charms of music and\r\npainting; in a word, every thing most enchanting that nature,\r\nassisted by art, could produce, successively flattered his sight, his\r\ntaste, his smell, his hearing, and his feeling.\r\n\r\n\"In a superb saloon, whither he conducted me,\" says this gentleman,\r\n\"were six young beauties, dressed in an extraordinary manner, whose\r\npersons, at first sight, did not appear unknown to me: it struck me\r\nthat I had seen their faces more than once, and I was accordingly\r\ngoing to address them, when Mr. B----, smiling at my mistake,\r\nexplained to me the cause of it.\" \"I have, in my amours,\" said he, \"a\r\nparticular fancy. The choicest beauty of Circassia would have ho\r\nmerit in my eyes, did she not resemble the portrait of some woman,\r\ncelebrated in past ages: and while lovers set great value on a\r\nminiature which faithfully exhibits the features of their mistress, I\r\nesteem mine only in proportion to their resemblance to ancient\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n\"Conformably to this idea,\" continued Mr. B----, \"I have caused the\r\nintendant of my pleasures to travel all over Europe, with select\r\nportraits, or engravings, copied from the originals. He has succeeded\r\nin his researches, as you see, since you have conceived that you\r\nrecognized these ladies on whom you have never before set your eyes;\r\nbut whose likenesses you may, undoubtedly, have met with. Their dress\r\nmust have contributed to your mistake: they all wear the attire of\r\nthe personage they represent; for I wish their whole person to be\r\npicturesque. By these means, I have travelled back several centuries,\r\nand am in possession of beauties whom time had placed at a great\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supper was served up. Mr. B---- seated himself between Mary, queen\r\nof Scots, and Anne Bullein. I placed myself opposite to him,\"\r\nconcludes the gentleman, \"having beside me Ninon de l'Enclos, and\r\nGabrielle d'Estrées. We also had the company of the fair Rosamond and\r\nNell Gwynn; but at the head of the table was a vacant elbow-chair,\r\nsurmounted by a canopy, and destined for Cleopatra, who was coming\r\nfrom Egypt, and of whose arrival Mr. B---- was in hourly\r\nexpectation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 21, 1801._\r\n\r\nOften as we have heard of the extraordinary number of places of\r\npublic entertainment in Paris, few, if any, persons in England have\r\nan idea of its being so considerable as it is, even at the present\r\nmoment. But, in 1799, at the very time when we were told over and\r\nover again in Parliament, that France was unable to raise the\r\nnecessary supplies for carrying on the war, and would, as a matter of\r\ncourse, be compelled not only to relinquish her further projects of\r\naggrandisement, but to return to her ancient territorial limits; at\r\nthat critical period, there existed in Paris, and its environs, no\r\nless than seventy\r\n\r\nPUBLIC PLACES OF VARIOUS DESCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_, nothing like this number was ever known. Such\r\nan almost incredible variety of amusements is really a phenomenon, in\r\nthe midst of a war, unexampled in its consumption of blood and\r\ntreasure, It proves that, whatever may have been the public distress,\r\nthere was at least a great _show_ of private opulence. Indeed I have\r\nbeen informed that, at the period alluded to, a spirit of\r\nindifference, prodigality, and dissipation, seemed to pervade every\r\nclass of society. Whether placed at the bottom or the top of\r\nFortune's wheel, a thirst of gain and want of economy were alike\r\nconspicuous among all ranks of people. Those who strained every nerve\r\nto obtain riches, squandered them with equal profusion.\r\n\r\nNo human beings on earth can be more fond of diversion than the\r\nParisians. Like the Romans of old, they are content if they have but\r\n_panem et circenses_, which a Frenchman would render by _spectacles\r\net de quoi manger_. However divided its inhabitants may be on\r\npolitical subjects, on the score of amusement at least the Republic\r\nis one and indivisible. In times of the greatest scarcity, many a\r\nperson went dinnerless to the theatre, eating whatever scrap he could\r\nprocure, and consoling himself by the idea of being amused for the\r\nevening, and at the same time saving at home the expense of fire and\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nThe following list of public places, which I have transcribed for\r\nyour satisfaction, was communicated to me by a person of veracity;\r\nand, as far as it goes, its correctness has been confirmed by my own\r\nobservation. Although it falls short of the number existing here two\r\nyears ago, it will enable you to judge of the ardour still prevalent\r\namong the Parisians, for \"running at the ring of pleasure.\" Few of\r\nthese places are shut up, except for the winter; and new ones succeed\r\nalmost daily to those which are finally closed. However, for the sake\r\nof perspicuity, I shall annex the letter S to such as are intended\r\nchiefly for summer amusement.\r\n\r\n1. _Théâtre des Arts, Rue de la Loi_.\r\n\r\n2. _------- Français, Rue de la Loi._\r\n\r\n3. _------- Feydeau, Rue Feydeau._\r\n\r\n4. _------- Louvois, Rue de Louvois._\r\n\r\n5. _------- Favart,_ now _Opéra Buffa._\r\n\r\n6. _------- de la Porte St. Martin._\r\n\r\n7. _------- de la Société Olympique_ (late _Opéra Buffa.)_\r\n\r\n8. _------- du Vaudeville, Rue de Chartres._\r\n\r\n9. _------- Montansier, Palais du Tribunat._\r\n\r\n10. _------- de l'Ambigu Comique, Boulevard du Temple._\r\n\r\n11. _------- de la Gaiété, Boulevard du Temple._\r\n\r\n12. _------- des Jeunes Artistes, Boulevard St. Martin._\r\n\r\n13. _------- des Jeunes Elèves, Rue de Thionville._\r\n\r\n14. _------- des Délassemens Comiques, Boulevard du Temple._\r\n\r\n15. _------- sans Prétension, Boulevard du Temple._\r\n\r\n16. _------- du Marais, Rue Culture Ste.

These were _l'Opéra les Français_, and _les\r\nItaliens_, which, with six inferior ones, called _petits spectacles_,\r\nbrought the whole of the theatres to ten in number. The subaltern\r\nhouses were incessantly checked in their career by the privileges\r\ngranted to the _Comédie Française_, which company alone enjoyed the\r\nright to play first-rate productions: it also possessed that of\r\ncensorship, and sometimes exercised it in the most despotic manner.\r\nAuthors, ever in dispute with the comedians, who dictated the law to\r\nthem, solicited, but in vain, the opening of a second French theatre.\r\nThe revolution took place, and the unlimited number of theatres was\r\npresently decreed. A great many new ones were opened; but the\r\nattraction of novelty dispersing the amateurs, the number of\r\nspectators did not always equal the expectation of the managers; and\r\nthe profits, divided among so many competitors, ceased to be\r\nsufficiently productive for the support of every establishment of\r\nthis description. The consequence was, that several of them were soon\r\nreduced to a state of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThree theatres of the first and second rank have been destroyed by\r\nfire within these two years, yet upwards of twenty are at present\r\nopen, almost every night, exclusively of several associations of\r\nself-denominated _artistes-amateurs._\r\n\r\nAmidst this false glare of dramatic wealth, theatres of the first\r\nrank have imperceptibly declined, and at last fallen. It comes not\r\nwithin my province or intention to seek the causes of this in the\r\ndefects of their management; but the fact is notorious. The _Théâtres\r\nFavart_ and _Feydeau_, at each of which French comic operas were\r\nchiefly represented, have at length been obliged to unite the\r\nstrength of their talents, and the disgrace which they have\r\nexperienced, has not affected any of those inferior playhouses where\r\nsubaltern performers establish their success on an assemblage of\r\nscenes more coarse, and language more unpolished.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the government appear to have taken this\r\ndecline of the principal theatres into serious consideration. It is,\r\nI understand, alike to be apprehended, that they may concern\r\nthemselves too little or too much in their welfare. Hitherto the\r\npersons charged with the difficult task of upholding the falling\r\ntheatres of the first rank, have had the good sense to confine their\r\nmeasures to conciliation; but, of late, it has been rumoured that the\r\nstage is to be subjected to its former restrictions. The benefit\r\nresulting to the art itself and to the public, from a rivalship of\r\ntheatres, is once more called in question: and some people even go so\r\nfar as to assert that, with the exception of a few abuses, the\r\ndirection of the _Gentils-hommes de la chambre_ was extremely good:\r\nthence it should seem that the only difficulty is to find these lords\r\nof the bed-chamber, if there be any still in being, in order to\r\nrestore to them their dramatic sceptre.[1]\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the liberty introduced by the revolution has been, in many\r\nrespects, abused, and in too many, perhaps, relative to places of\r\npublic amusement. But must it, on that account, be entirely lost to\r\nthe stage, and falling into a contrary excess, must recourse be had\r\nto arbitrary measures, which might also be abused by those to whose\r\nexecution they were intrusted? The unlimited number of theatres may\r\nbe a proper subject for the interference of the government: but as to\r\nthe liberty of the theatres, included in the number that may be fixed\r\non to represent pieces of every description, such only excepted as\r\nmay be hurtful to morals, seems to be a salutary and incontestable\r\nprinciple. This it is that, by disengaging the French comic opera\r\nfrom the narrow sphere to which it was confined, has, in a great\r\nmeasure, effected a musical revolution, at which all persons of taste\r\nmust rejoice, by introducing on that stage the harmonic riches of\r\n\r\nItaly. This too it is that has produced, on theatres of the second\r\nand third rank, pieces which are neither deficient in regularity,\r\nconnexion, representation, nor decoration. The effect of such a\r\nprinciple was long wanted here before the revolution, when the\r\nindependent spirit of dramatic authors was fettered by the\r\nprocrastinations of a set of privileged comedians, who discouraged\r\nthem by ungracious refusals, or disgusted them by unjust preferences.\r\nHence, the old adage in France that, when an author had composed a\r\ngood piece, he had performed but half his task; this was true, as the\r\nmore difficult half, namely, the getting it read and represented,\r\nstill remained to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs for the multiplicity of playhouses, it certainly belongs to the\r\ngovernment to limit their number, not by privileges which might be\r\ngranted through favour, or obtained, perhaps, for money. The taste of\r\nthe public for theatrical diversions being known, the population\r\nshould first be considered, as it is that which furnishes both money\r\nand spectators. It would be easy to ascertain the proportion between\r\nthe population of the capital and the number of theatres which it\r\nought to comprise. Public places should be free as to the species of\r\namusement, but limited in their number, so as not to exceed the\r\nproportion which the population can bear. The houses would then be\r\nconstantly well attended, and the proprietors, actors, authors, and\r\nall those concerned in their success, secure against the consequences\r\nof failure, and the true interest of the art be likewise promoted. In\r\na word, neither absolute independence, nor exclusive privilege should\r\nprevail; but a middle course be adopted, in order to fix the fate of\r\nthose great scenic establishments, which, by forming so essential a\r\npart of public diversion, have a proportionate influence on the\r\nmorals of the nation.\r\n\r\nI have been led, by degrees, into these observations, not only from a\r\nreview of the decline of some of the principal playhouses here, but\r\nalso from a conviction that their general principle is applicable to\r\nevery other capital in Europe. What, for example, can be more absurd\r\nthan, in the dog-days, when room and air are particularly requisite,\r\nthat the lovers of dramatic amusement in the British metropolis are\r\nto be crammed into a little theatre in the Haymarket, and stewed year\r\nafter year, as in a sweating-room at a bagnio, because half a century\r\nago an exclusive privilege was inconsiderately granted?\r\n\r\nThe playhouses here, in general, have been well attended this winter,\r\nparticularly the principal ones; but, in Paris, every rank has not\r\nexactly its theatre as at a ball. From the _spectacles_ on the\r\n_Boulevards_ to those of the first and second rank, there is a\r\nmixture of company. Formerly, the lower classes confined themselves\r\nsolely to the former; at present, they visit the latter. An increase\r\nof wages has enabled the workman to gratify his inclination for the\r\nindulgence of a species of luxury; and, by a sort of instinct, he now\r\nand then takes a peep at those scenes of which he before entertained,\r\nfrom hearsay, but an imperfect idea.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to see a new or favourite piece, you must not neglect to\r\nsecure a seat in proper time; for, on such occasions, the house is\r\nfull long before the rising of the curtain. As to taking places in\r\nthe manner we do in England, there is no such arrangement to be made,\r\nexcept, indeed, you choose to take a whole box, which is expensive.\r\nIn that case you pay for it at the time you engage it, and it is kept\r\nlocked the whole evening, or till you and your party, make your\r\nappearance.[2]\r\n\r\nAt all the _spectacles_ in Paris, you are literally kept on the\r\noutside of the house till you have received a ticket, in exchange for\r\nyour money, through an aperture in the exterior wall. Within a few\r\npaces of the door of the principal theatres are two receiver's\r\noffices, which are no sooner open, than candidates for admission\r\nbegin to form long ranks, extending from the portico into the very\r\nstreet, and advance to them two abreast in regular succession. A\r\nsteady sentinel, posted at the aperture, repeats your wishes to the\r\nreceiver, and in a mild, conciliating manner, facilitates their\r\naccomplishment. Other sentinels are stationed for the preservation of\r\norder, under the immediate eye of the officer, who sees that every\r\none takes his turn to obtain tickets: however, it is not uncommon,\r\nfor forestallers to procure a certain number of them, especially at\r\nthe representation of a new or favourite piece, and offer them\r\nprivately at a usurious price which many persons are glad to pay\r\nrather than fall into the rear of the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe method I always take to avoid this unpleasant necessity, I will\r\nrecommend to you as a very simple one, which may, perhaps, prevent\r\nyou from many a theatrical disappointment. Having previously informed\r\nmyself what _spectacle_ is best worth seeing, while I am at dinner I\r\nsend my _valet de place_, or if I cannot conveniently spare him, I\r\ndesire him to dispatch a _commissionnaire_ for the number of tickets\r\nwanted, so that when I arrive at the theatre, I have only to walk in,\r\nand place myself to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is very wisely imagined not to establish the receiver's offices in\r\nthe inside of the house, as in our theatres. By this plan, however\r\ngreat may be the crowd, the entrance is always unobstructed, and\r\nthose violent struggles and pressures, which among us have cost the\r\nlives of many, are effectually prevented. You will observe that no\r\nhalf-price is taken at any theatre in Paris; but in different parts\r\nof the house, there are offices, called _bureaux de supplément_,\r\nwhere, if you want to pass from one part of it to another, you\r\nexchange your counter-mark on paying the difference.\r\n\r\nNothing can be better regulated than the present police, both\r\ninterior and exterior, of the theatres in Paris. The eye is not\r\nshocked, as was formerly the case, by the presence of black-whiskered\r\ngrenadiers, occupying different parts of the house, and, by the\r\ninflexible sternness of their countenance, awing the spectators into\r\na suppression of their feelings. No fusileer, with a fixed bayonet\r\nand piece loaded with ball, now dictates to the auditors of the pit\r\nthat such a seat must hold so many persons, though several among them\r\nmight, probably, be as broad-bottomed as Dutchmen. If you find\r\nyourself incommoded by heat or pressure, you are at liberty to\r\ndeclare it without fear of giving offence. The criticism of a man of\r\ntaste is no longer silenced by the arbitrary control of a military\r\ndespot, who, for an exclamation or gesture, not exactly coinciding\r\nwith his own prepossessions, pointed him out to his myrmidons, and\r\ntransferred him at once to prison. You may now laugh with Molèire, or\r\nweep with Racine, without having your mirth or sensibility thus\r\nunseasonably checked in its expansion.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this despotism has been denied; but facts are\r\nstubborn things, and I will relate to you an instance in which I saw\r\nit most wantonly exercised. Some years ago I was present at the\r\n_Théâtre Français_, when, in one of Corneille's pieces, Mademoiselle\r\nRaucourt, the tragic actress, was particularly negligent in the\r\ndelivery of a passage, which, to do justice to the author, required\r\nthe nicest discrimination. An amateur in the _parterre_ reproved her,\r\nin a very gentle manner, for a wrong emphasis. Being at this time a\r\nfavourite of the queen, she was, it seems, superior to admonition,\r\nand persisted in her misplaced shrieks, till it became evident that\r\nshe set the audience at defiance: other persons then joined the\r\nformer in expressing their disapprobation. Instantly the _major_\r\nsingled out the leading critic: two grenadiers forced their way to\r\nthe place where he was seated, and conveyed him to prison for having\r\nhad the audacity to reprove an actress in favour at court. From such\r\nimproper exercise of authority, the following verse had become a\r\nproverb:\r\n\r\n  _\"II est bien des sifflets, mais nous avons la garde.\"_\r\n\r\nMany there are, I know, who approved of this manner of bridling the\r\nfickle Parisians, on the ground that they were so used to the curb\r\nthat they could no longer dispense with it. A guard on the outside of\r\na theatre is unquestionably necessary, and proper for the\r\npreservation of order; but that the public should not be at liberty\r\nto approve or condemn such a passage, or such an actor, is at once to\r\nstifle the expression of that general opinion which alone can produce\r\ngood performers. The interior police of the theatre being at present\r\nalmost entirely in the hands of the public themselves, it is, on that\r\naccount, more justly observed and duly respected.\r\n\r\nConsidering the natural impetuosity of their character, one is\r\nsurprised at the patient tranquillity with which the French range\r\nthemselves in their places. Seldom do they interrupt the performance\r\nby loud conversation, but exchange their thoughts in a whisper. When\r\none sees them applaud with rapture a tender scene, which breathes\r\nsentiments of humanity or compassion, speaks home to every feeling\r\nheart, and inspires the most agreeable sensations, one is tempted to\r\nquestion whether the Parisians of the present day belong to the\r\nidentical race that could, at one time, display the ferocity of\r\ntigers, and, at another, the tameness of lambs, while their nearest\r\nrelations and best friends were daily bleeding on the scaffold?\r\n\r\nBy the existing regulations, many of which are worthy of being\r\nadopted in London, no theatre can be opened in Paris without the\r\npermission of the police, who depute proper persons to ascertain that\r\nthe house is solidly built, the passages and outlets unincumbered and\r\ncommodious, and that it is provided with reservoirs of water, and an\r\nadequate number of fire-engines.\r\n\r\nEvery public place that may be open, is to be shut up immediately,\r\nif, for one single day, the proprietors neglect to keep the\r\nreservoirs full of water, the engines in proper order, and the\r\nfiremen ready.\r\n\r\nNo persons can be admitted behind the scenes, except those employed\r\nin the service of the theatre. Nor is the number of tickets\r\ndistributed to exceed that of the persons the house can conveniently\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nNo coachman, under any pretext whatever, can quit the reins of his\r\nhorses, while the persons he has driven, are getting out of or into\r\ntheir carriage. Indeed, the necessity of his doing so is obviated by\r\nporters stationed at the door of the theatres, and appointed by the\r\npolice. They are distinguished by a brass plate, on which their\r\npermission and the name of the theatre are engraved.\r\n\r\nAt all the theatres in Paris, there is an exterior guard, which is at\r\nthe disposal of the _civil_ officer, stationed there for the\r\npreservation of order. This guard cannot enter the inside of the\r\ntheatre but in case of the safety of the public being exposed, and at\r\nthe express requisition of the said officer, who can never introduce\r\nthe armed force into the house, till after he has, in a loud voice,\r\napprized the audience of his intention.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen is bound to obey, _provisionally_, the officer of\r\npolice. In consequence, every person invited by the officer of\r\npolice, or summoned by him, to quit the house, is immediately to\r\nrepair to the police-office of the theatre, in order to give such\r\nexplanations as may be required of him. The said officer may either\r\ntransfer him to the competent tribunal, or set him at liberty,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nProper places are appointed for carriages to wait at. When the play\r\nis ended, no carriage in waiting can move till the first crowd coming\r\nout of the house has disappeared. The commanding officer of the guard\r\non duty decides the moment when carriages may be called.\r\n\r\nNo carriage can move quicker than a foot-pace, and but on a single\r\nrank, till it has got clear of the streets in the vicinity of the\r\ntheatre. Nor can it arrive thither but by the streets appointed for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo hours before the rising of the curtain, sentinels are placed in\r\nsufficient number to facilitate the execution of these orders, and to\r\nprevent any obstruction in the different avenues of the theatre.\r\n\r\nIndeed, obstruction is now seldom seen; I have more than once had the\r\ncuriosity to count, and cause to be counted, all the _private_\r\ncarriages in waiting at the grand French opera, on a night when the\r\nboxes were filled with the most fashionable company. Neither I nor my\r\n_valet de place_ could ever reckon more than from forty to fifty;\r\nwhereas, formerly, it was not uncommon to see here between two and\r\nthree hundred; and the noise of so many equipages rattling through\r\nthe streets, from each of the principal theatres, sufficiently\r\nindicated that the performance was ended.\r\n\r\nBy the number of advertisements in the _petites affiches_ or daily\r\nadvertiser of Paris, offering a reward for articles lost, no doubt\r\ncan exist of there being a vast number of pickpockets in this gay\r\ncapital; and a stranger must naturally draw such an inference from\r\nobserving where the pockets are placed in men's clothes: in the coat,\r\nit is in the inside of the facing, parallel to the breast: in the\r\nwaistcoat, it is also in the inside, but lower down, so that when a\r\nFrenchman wants to take out his money, he must go through the\r\nceremony of unbuttoning first his surtout, if he wears one in winter,\r\nthen his coat, and lastly his waistcoat. In this respect, the ladies\r\nhave the advantage; for, as I have already mentioned, they wear no\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: During the old _régime_, the theatres were under the\r\ncontrol of the _Gentils-hommes de la chambre_, but at the\r\nestablishment of the directorial government, they were placed in the\r\npower of the Minister of the Interior, in whose department they have\r\nsince continued. Of late, however, it is asserted, that they are each\r\nto be under the direction of a Prefect of the Palace.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Independently of the boxes reserved for the officers of\r\nthe staff of the city of Paris, and those at the head of the police,\r\nwho have individually free admission to all the _spectacles_ on\r\nproducing their ivory ticket, there is also a box at each theatre\r\nappropriated to the Minister of Public Instruction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 23, 1801._\r\n\r\nYesterday being the day appointed for the opening of the session of\r\nthe Legislative Body, I was invited by a member to accompany him\r\nthither, in order to witness their proceedings. No one can be\r\nadmitted without a ticket; and by the last constitution it is\r\ndecreed, that not more than two hundred strangers are to be present\r\nat the sittings. The gallery allotted for the accommodation of the\r\npublic, is small, even in proportion to that number, and, in general,\r\nextremely crowded. My friend, aware of this circumstance, did me the\r\nfavour to introduce me into the body of the hall, where I was seated\r\nvery conveniently, both for seeing and hearing, near the _tribune_,\r\nto the left of the President.\r\n\r\nThis hall was built for the Council of Five Hundred, on the site of\r\nthe grand apartments of the _Palais Bourbon_. Since the accession of\r\nthe consular government, it has been appropriated to the sittings of\r\nthe Legislative Body, on which account the palace has taken their\r\nname, and over the principal entrance is inscribed, in embossed\r\ncharacters of gilt bronze:\r\n\r\nPALAIS DU CORPS LÉGISLATIF.\r\n\r\nThe palace stands on the south bank of the Seine, facing the _Pont de\r\nla Concorde_. It was begun, in 1722, for Louise-Françoise de Bourbon,\r\na legitimated daughter of Lewis XIV. GIRARDINI, an Italian architect,\r\nplanned the original building, the construction of which was\r\nafterwards superintended by LASSURANCE and GABRIEL. The Prince de\r\nCondé having acquired it by purchase, he caused it to be considerably\r\naugmented and embellished, at different times, under the direction of\r\nBARRAU, CARPENTIER and BÉLISARD.\r\n\r\nHad the _Pont de la Concorde_ subsisted previously to the erection of\r\nthe _Palais Bourbon_, the principal entrance would, probably, have\r\nbeen placed towards the river; but it faces the north, and is\r\npreceded by a paltry square, now called _Place du Corps Législatif_.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of a peristyle, of the Corinthian order, is the grand\r\ngateway, crowned by a sort of triumphal arch, which is connected, by\r\na double colonnade, to two handsome pavilions. The lateral buildings\r\nof the outer court, which is two hundred and eighty feet in length,\r\nare decorated with the same order, and a second court of two hundred\r\nand forty feet, includes part of the original palace, which is\r\nconstructed in the Italian style.\r\n\r\nThe principal entrances to the right and left lead to two halls; the\r\none dedicated to _Peace_; the other, to _Victory_. On the one side,\r\nis a communication to the apartments of the old palace; on the other,\r\nare two spacious rooms. The room to the left, inscribed to _Liberty_,\r\nis intended for petitioners, &c.; that to the right, inscribed to\r\n_Equality_, is appropriated to conferences. Between the halls of\r\nLiberty and Equality, is the hall of the sittings of the Legislative\r\nBody.\r\n\r\nThe form of this hall is semicircular; the benches, rising gradually\r\none above the other, as in a Roman amphitheatre, are provided with\r\nbacks, and well adapted both for ease and convenience. They are\r\nintersected by passages, which afford to the members the facility of\r\nreaching or quitting their places, without disturbance or confusion.\r\nEvery seat is distinguished by a number, so that a deputy can never\r\nbe at a loss to find his place. In the centre, is an elevated\r\nrostrum, with a seat for the President, directly under which is the\r\n_tribune_, also elevated, for the orator addressing the assembly. The\r\ntribune is decorated by a bas-relief, in white marble, representing\r\nFrance writing her constitution, and Fame proclaiming it. The table\r\nfor the four secretaries is placed facing the tribune, beneath which\r\nthe _huissiers_ take their station. The desk and seat of the\r\nPresident, formed of solid mahogany, are ornamented with _or moulu_.\r\nThe folding doors, which open into the hall, to the right and left of\r\nthe President's chair, are also of solid mahogany, embellished in the\r\nsame manner. Their frames are of white marble, richly sculptured.\r\nIndependently of these doors, there are others, serving as a\r\ncommunication to the upper-seats, by means of two elegant stone\r\nstair-cases.\r\n\r\nIn six niches, three on each side of the tribune, are so many statues\r\nof Greek and Roman legislators. On the right, are Lycurgus, Solon,\r\nand Demosthenes: on the left, Brutus, Cato, and Cicero. The inside of\r\nthe hall is in stucco, and the upper part is decorated by a colonnade\r\nof the Ionic order. The light proceeds from a cupola, glazed in the\r\ncentre, and the remainder of which is divided into small\r\ncompartments, each ornamented by an emblematical figure. The floor is\r\npaved with marble, also in compartments, embellished with allegorical\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\nHaving made you acquainted with the hall of the sittings, I think it\r\nmay not be uninteresting to give you an account of the forms observed\r\nin opening the session.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, with my friend, at the Palace of the Legislative\r\nBody, most of the members were already assembled in the apartments of\r\ntheir library. At noon, they thence repaired to the hall, preceded by\r\nthe _huissiers_, messengers of state, and secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the session was announced by the report of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe oldest member, in point of years, took the President's chair,\r\nprovisionally.\r\n\r\nThe four youngest members of the assembly were called to the table to\r\ndischarge the office of secretaries, also provisionally.\r\n\r\nThe provisional President then declared, that the members of the\r\nLegislative Body were assembled by virtue of Article XXXIII of the\r\nconstitution, for the session of the year X; that, being\r\nprovisionally organized, the sitting was opened; and that their names\r\nwere going to be called over, for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\nnumber of members present, and for forming definitive arrangements,\r\nby the nomination of a president and four secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe names were then called over alphabetically, and, after they were\r\nall gone through, they were recalled.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony being terminated, four committees, each composed of\r\nfour members, whose names were drawn by lot by the President,\r\nproceeded, in presence of the assembly, to scrutinize the ballot.\r\n\r\nIt thence resulted, that the number of members present was two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight;\r\n\r\nThat Citizen DUPUIS was elected President by a majority of votes;\r\n\r\nThat Citizens DUBOSC, BORD, ESTAQUE, and CLAVIER were individually\r\nelected, by a similar majority, to officiate as secretaries.\r\n\r\nIn consequence. Citizen DUPUIS was proclaimed President, and took the\r\nchair. He then moved the following resolution, which was agreed to:\r\n\r\n\"The Legislative Body declares, that it is definitely constituted,\r\nand decrees that the present declaration shall be carried to the\r\nConservative Senate, to the Tribunate, and to the Consuls of the\r\nRepublic, by a messenger of State.\"\r\n\r\nThe President next addressed the assembly in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Citizens Legislators,\r\n\r\n\"After twelve years of a painful and glorious struggle against all\r\nEurope, in order to insure the triumph of the liberty of man and that\r\nof nations, the moment is at length arrived when Peace is on the\r\npoint of crowning the efforts of the French people, and securing the\r\nRepublic on a foundation never to be shaken. For this peace, which\r\nwill unite by the bonds of friendship two great nations, already\r\nconnected by esteem, we are indebted to the valour and wisdom of the\r\nheroic pacificator, to the wise administration of the government, to\r\nthe bravery of our invincible armies, to the good understanding\r\nsubsisting between all the constituted authorities, and, above all,\r\nto that spirit of moderation which has known how to fix limits to\r\nvictory itself. The name of peace, so dear to the friend of human\r\nnature, ought to impose silence on all malignant passions, cordially\r\nunite all the children of the same country, and be the signal of\r\nhappiness to the present generation, as well as to our posterity.\r\n\r\n\"How gratifying is it to us, Citizens Legislators, after having\r\npassed through the storms of a long revolution, to have at length\r\nbrought safely into port the sacred bark of the Republic, and to\r\nbegin this session by the proclamation of peace to the world, as\r\nthose who preceded us opened theirs by the proclamation of the Rights\r\nof Man and that of the Republic! To crown this great work, nothing\r\nmore remains for us but to make those laws so long expected, which\r\nare to complete social organization, and regulate the interests of\r\ncitizens. This code, already prepared by men of consummate prudence,\r\nwill, I hope, be soon submitted to your examination and sanction; and\r\nthe present session will be the most glorious epoch of our Republic:\r\nfor there is nothing more glorious to man than to insure the\r\nhappiness of his fellow-creatures, and scatter beforehand the first\r\nseeds of the liberty of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"_L'impression! L'impression!_\" was the cry that instantly proceeded\r\nfrom bench to bench on the close of this speech, which was delivered\r\nin a manner that did honour to the President's feelings. But, though\r\nyou have it, as it were, at second-hand, and cannot be struck by\r\nCitizen DUPUIS' manner, I hope you will deem the matter sufficiently\r\ninteresting to justify its insertion in this letter.\r\n\r\nThree orators, deputed by the government, were next announced, and\r\nintroduced in form. They were habited in their dress of Counsellors\r\nof State, that is, a scarlet coat, richly embroidered in shaded silks\r\nof the same colour, over which they wore a tricoloured silk sash.\r\n\r\nOne of them, having ascended the tribune, and obtained leave to\r\nspeak, read an extract from the registers of the Council of State,\r\ndated the 24th of Brumaire, purporting that the First Consul had\r\nnominated the Counsellors of State, REGNIER, BÉRENGER, and DUMAS to\r\nrepair to the present sitting. Citizen REGNIER then addressed the\r\nassembly in the name of the government. He read his speech from a\r\npaper which he held in his hand. It began by announcing the signature\r\nof the preliminaries of peace with England, and informed the\r\nLegislative Body that measures had been taken by the government for\r\nregulating the various branches of the interior administration and of\r\nits intention to submit to them the civil code. It was replete with\r\nlanguage of a conciliating nature, and concluded with a wish that the\r\nmost unalterable harmony might subsist between the first authorities\r\nof the State, and strengthen in the mind of the people the confidence\r\nwhich they already testified.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenour of this speech, I think it may be inferred that the\r\ngovernment is apprehensive of a difference of opinion respecting the\r\ncivil code; not so much in this place, for, by the constitution, the\r\nlips of the deputies are sealed, but in the Tribunate, where a warm\r\ndiscussion may be expected.\r\n\r\nThe President made a short and apt reply to the orators of the\r\ngovernment, who then retired with the same ceremony with which they\r\nhad entered. Both these speeches were ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Senate addressed to the Legislative Body, by a\r\nmessage read by the President, the different acts emanated from its\r\nauthority since the last session. Ordered to be inserted in the\r\nJournals. A few letters were also read by the President from\r\ndifferent members, excusing themselves for non-attendance on account\r\nof indisposition. Several authors having addressed a copy of their\r\nworks to the Legislative Body, these presents were accepted, and\r\nordered to be placed in their library.\r\n\r\nThe administrative commission of the Legislative Body announced that\r\nthe ambassador of the Cisalpine Republic had sent a present of three\r\nhundred medals, struck on occasion of the peace and of the _forum\r\nBonaparte_, which medals were distributed to the members.\r\n\r\nThe assembly the broke up, the next sitting being appointed for the\r\nfollowing day at noon.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis and suite sat in the box allotted to Foreign\r\nMinisters, facing the President, as did the Marquis de Lucchesini,\r\nthe Prussian ambassador, and some others. A small box is likewise\r\nappropriated to reporters, who take down the proceedings. The members\r\nwere all habited in their appointed dress, which consists of a dark\r\nblue coat embroidered with gold, blue pantaloons and white waistcoat,\r\nalso embroidered, a tricoloured silk sash, worn above the coat, and\r\nornamented with a rich gold fringe. They wore a plain cocked hat,\r\nwith the national cockade, and short boots. This meeting of\r\nlegislators, all in the same dress, undoubtedly presents a more\r\nimposing spectacle than such a variegated assemblage as is sometimes\r\nto be seen in our House of Commons.\r\n\r\nBy the present constitution, you will see that no new law can be\r\npromulgated, unless decreed by the Legislative Body.\r\n\r\nThe votes in this assembly being taken by ballot, and the laws being\r\nenacted without any discussion, on the part of its members, on the\r\nplans debated before it by the orators of the Tribunate and of the\r\ngovernment, it necessarily follows that the sittings present far less\r\ninterest to strangers, than would result from an animated delivery of\r\nthe opinion of a few leading orators.\r\n\r\nBefore I take leave of this palace, I must introduce you into the\r\nsuite of rooms formerly distinguished by the appellation of _petits\r\nappartemens du Palais Bourbon_, and which, before the revolution,\r\nconstituted one of the curiosities of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of these, BÉLISARD assembled all the charms of\r\nmodern elegance. The vestibule, coloured in French gray, contains, in\r\nthe intervals between the doors, figures of Bacchantes, and, in the\r\nceiling, wreaths of roses and other ornaments painted in imitation of\r\nrelief. The eating-room, which comes next, is decorated so as to\r\nrepresent a verdant bower, the paintings are under mirrors, and\r\ntin-plate, cut out in the Chinese manner, seems to shew light\r\nthrough the foliage. In two niches, made in the arbour-work, in the\r\nform of porticoes, which Cupids are crowning with garlands, are\r\nplaced two statues from the antique, the one representing Venus\r\n_pudica_, and the other, Venus _callypyga_, or _aux belles fesses_:\r\nmirrors, placed in the niches, reflect beauties which the eye could\r\nnot discover.\r\n\r\nThe drawing room, another enchanting place, is of a circular form,\r\nsurrounded with Ionic pillars. In the intercolumniations, are arches\r\nlined with mirrors, and ornamented with the most tasteful hangings.\r\nUnder each arch is a sopha. The ceiling represents caryatides\r\nsupporting a circular gallery, between which are different subjects,\r\nsuch as the Toilet of Venus, the Departure of Adonis, &c. Every thing\r\nhere is gallant and rich; but mark the secret wonder. You pull a\r\nstring; the ceiling rises like a cloud, and exhibits to view an\r\nextensive sky, with which it becomes confounded. The music of an\r\ninvisible orchestra, placed above the ceiling, used to be heard\r\nthrough the opening, and produced a charming effect, when\r\nentertainments were given in these apartments.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. You pull another string; and, by means of concealed\r\nmachinery, the aperture of the three casements suddenly becomes\r\noccupied by pannels of mirrors, so that you may here instantly turn\r\nday into night. The bed-chamber, the _boudoir_, the study, &c., are\r\nall decorated in a style equally elegant and tasteful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 25, 1801._\r\n\r\nOf all the public edifices in this capital, I know of none whose\r\ninterior astonishes so much, at first sight, and so justly claims\r\nadmiration, especially from those who have a knowledge of\r\narchitecture or mechanics, as the\r\n\r\nHALLE AU BLÉ.\r\n\r\nThis building is destined for the reception of corn and flour: it was\r\nbegun in 1762, on the site of the ancient _Hôtel de Soissons_, which\r\nwas purchased by the city of Paris. In the space of three years, the\r\nhall and the circumjacent houses were finished, under the direction\r\nof the architect, CAMUS DE MEZIÈRE.\r\n\r\nThe circular form of this hall, the solidity of its construction, its\r\ninsulated position, together with the noble simplicity of its\r\ndecoration, perfectly accord with the intention and character of the\r\nobject proposed. Twenty-five arches, all of equal size, serve each as\r\nan entrance. On the ground-floor are pillars of the Tuscan order,\r\nsupporting vast granaries, the communication to which is by two\r\nstair-cases of well-executed design.\r\n\r\nThe court is covered by a cupola of one hundred and twenty feet in\r\ndiameter, forming a perfect semicircle, whose centre, taken on a\r\nlevel with the cornice, is forty-four feet from the ground. The dome\r\nof the Pantheon at Rome, which is the largest known, exceeds that of\r\nthe _Halle au Blé_ by thirteen feet only. This cupola is entirely\r\ncomposed of deal boards, a foot in breadth, an inch in thickness, and\r\nabout four feet in length. It is divided into twenty-five lateral\r\nopenings, which give as many rays of light diverging from the\r\ncentre-opening, whose diameter is twenty-four feet. These openings\r\nare all glazed, and the wood-work of the dome is covered with sheets\r\nof tinned copper.\r\n\r\nPHILIBERT DE L'ORME, architect to Henry II, was the original author\r\nof this new method of covering domes, though he never carried it into\r\nexecution. As a homage for the discovery, MOLINOS and LEGRAND, the\r\narchitects of the cupola, have there placed a medallion with his\r\nportrait. It is said that this experiment was deemed so hazardous,\r\nthat the builder could find no person bold enough to strike away the\r\nshores, and was under the necessity of performing that task in\r\nperson. To him it was not a fearful one; but the workmen,\r\nunacquainted with the principles of this manner of roofing buildings,\r\nwere astonished at the stability of the dome, when the shores were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nNo place in Paris could well be more convenient for giving a banquet\r\nthan the _Halle au Blé_; twelve or fourteen hundred persons might\r\nhere be accommodated at table; and little expense would be required\r\nfor decoration, as nothing can be more elegant than the cupola\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSeveral periodical publications give a statement, more or less exact,\r\nof the quantity of flour lodged in this spacious repository, which is\r\nfilled and emptied regularly every four or five days. But these\r\nstatements present not the real consumption of Paris, since several\r\nbakers draw their supply directly from the farmers of the environs;\r\nand, besides, a great quantity of loaves are brought into the capital\r\nfrom some villages, famous for making bread, whose inhabitants come\r\nand retail them to the Parisians.\r\n\r\nThe annual consumption of bread-corn in this capital has, on an\r\naverage, been computed at twenty-four millions of bushels. But it is\r\nnot the consumption only that it is useful to know: the most material\r\npoint to be ascertained, is the method of providing effectually for\r\nit; so that, from a succession of unfavourable harvests, or any other\r\ncause, the regular supplies may not experience even a momentary\r\ninterruption. When it is considered that Paris contains eight or nine\r\nhundred thousand of the human race, it is evident that this branch of\r\nadministration requires all the vigilance of the government.\r\n\r\nBread is now reckoned enormously dear, nineteen _sous_ for the loaf\r\nof four pounds; but, during the winter of 1794, the Parisians felt\r\nall the horrors of a real famine. Among other articles of the first\r\nnecessity, bread was then so scarce, that long ranks of people were\r\nformed at the doors of the bakers' shops, each waiting in turn to\r\nreceive a scanty portion of two ounces.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of flour here is considerably increased by the\r\nimmense number of dogs, cats, monkies, parrots, and other birds, kept\r\nby persons of every class, and fed chiefly on bread and biscuit.\r\n\r\nNo poor devil that has not in his miserable lodging a dog to keep him\r\ncompany: not being able to find a friend among his own species, he\r\nseeks one in the brute creation. A pauper of this description, who\r\nshared his daily bread with his faithful companion, being urged to\r\npart with an animal that cost him so much to maintain: \"Part with\r\nhim!\" rejoined he; \"who then shall I get to love me?\"\r\n\r\nNear the _Halle au Blé_, stands a large fluted pillar of the Doric\r\norder, which formerly belonged to the _Hôtel de Soissons_, and served\r\nas an observatory to Catherine de Medicis. In the inside, is a\r\nwinding stair-case, leading to the top, whither that diabolical woman\r\nused frequently to ascend, accompanied by astrologers, and there\r\nperform several mysterious ceremonies, in order to discover futurity\r\nin the stars. She wore on her stomach a skin of parchment, strewn\r\nwith figures, letters, and characters of different colours; which\r\nskin she was persuaded had the virtue of insuring her from any\r\nattempt against her person.\r\n\r\nMuch about that period, 1572, there were reckoned, in Paris alone, no\r\nless than thirty thousand astrologers. At the present day, the\r\nambulating magicians frequent the _Old Boulevards_, and there tell\r\nfortunes for three or four _sous_; while those persons that value\r\nscience according to the price set on it, disdaining these two-penny\r\nconjurers, repair to fortune-tellers of a superior class, who take\r\nfrom three to six francs, and more, when the opportunity offers. The\r\nTROPHONIUS of Paris is Citizen Martin, who lives at N° 1773 _Rue\r\nd'Anjou_: the PHEMONOË is Madame Villeneuve, _Rue de l'Antechrist_.\r\n\r\nFormerly, none but courtesans here drew the cards; now, almost every\r\nfemale, without exception, has recourse to them. Many a fine lady\r\neven conceives herself to be sufficiently mistress of the art to tell\r\nher own fortune; and some think they are so skilled in reading\r\nfuturity in the cards, that they dare not venture to draw them for\r\nthemselves, for fear of discovering some untoward event.\r\n\r\nThis rage of astrology and fortune-telling is a disease which\r\npeculiarly affects weak intellects, ruled by ignorance, or afflicted\r\nby adversity. In the future, such persons seek a mitigation of the\r\npresent; and the illusive enjoyments of the mind make them almost\r\nforget the real sufferings of the body. According to Pope,\r\n\r\n  \"Hope springs eternal in the human breast,\r\n  Man never _is_, but always _to be_ blest.\"\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the above pillar, the only one of the sort in Paris,\r\nis erected a handsome fountain, which furnishes water from the Seine.\r\nAt two-thirds of its height is a dial of a singular kind, which marks\r\nthe precise hour at every period of the day, and in all seasons. It\r\nis the invention of Father Pingré, who was a regular canon of St.\r\nGeneviève, and member of the _ci-devant_ Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nWhile we are in this quarter, let us avail ourselves of the moment;\r\nand, proceeding from the _Halle au Blé_ along the _Rue Oblin_,\r\nexamine the\r\n\r\nCHURCH OF SAINT EUSTACHE.\r\n\r\nThis church, which is one of the most spacious in Paris, is situated\r\nat the north extremity of the _Rue des Prouvaires_, facing the _Rue\r\ndu Jour_. It was begun in 1532, but not finished till the year 1642.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the richness of its architecture, it presents not an\r\nappearance uniformly handsome, on account of the ill-combined mixture\r\nof the Greek and Gothic styles: besides, the pillars are so numerous\r\nin it, that it is necessary to be placed in the nave to view it to\r\nthe best advantage.\r\n\r\nThe new portal of _St. Eustache_, which was constructed in 1754, is\r\nformed of two orders, the Doric and the Ionic, the one above the\r\nother. At each extremity of this portal, rise two insulated towers,\r\nreceding from all the projection of the inferior order, and decorated\r\nby Corinthian columns with pilasters, on an attic serving as a socle.\r\nThese two towers were to have been crowned by a balustrade; one alone\r\nhas been finished.\r\n\r\nSeveral celebrated personages have been interred in this church.\r\nAmong them, I shall particularize one only; but that one will long\r\nlive in the memory of every convivial British seaman. Who has not\r\nheard the lay which records the defeat of Tourville? Yes--\r\n\r\n  He who \"on the main triumphant rode\r\n  To meet the gallant Russel in combat o'er the deep;\"\r\n  Who \"led his noble troops of heroes bold\r\n  To sink the English admiral and his fleet.\"\r\n\r\nThough considered by his countrymen, as one of the most eminent\r\nseamen that France ever produced, and enjoying at the time of his\r\ndeath the dignity of Marshal, together with that of Vice-admiral of\r\nthe kingdom, Tourville never had an epitaph. He died on the 28th of\r\nMay 1701, aged 59.\r\n\r\nSome of the monuments which existed here have been transferred to the\r\nMuseum in the _Rue des Petits Augustins_, where may be seen the\r\nsarcophagus of Colbert, Minister to Lewis XIV, and the medallion of\r\nCureau de la Chambre, physician to that king, and also his\r\nphysiognomist, whom he is said to have constantly consulted in the\r\nselection of his ministers. Among the papers of that physician there\r\nstill exists, in an unpublished correspondence with Lewis XIV, this\r\ncurious memorandum: \"Should I die before his majesty, he would run a\r\ngreat risk of making, in future, many a bad choice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enter one of these sanctuaries without reflecting\r\non the rapid progress of irreligion among a people who, six months\r\nbefore, were, on their knees, adoring the effigies which, at that\r\nperiod, they were eager to mutilate and destroy. Iron crows and\r\nsledge-hammers were almost in a state of requisition. In the\r\nbeginning, it was a contest who should first aim a blow at the nose\r\nof the Virgin Mary, or break the leg of her son. In one day,\r\ncontracts were entered into with masons for defacing images which for\r\ncenturies, had been partly concealed under the dusty webs of\r\ngenerations of spiders.\r\n\r\nAs for the statues within reach of swords and pikes, it was a\r\ncontinual scene of amusement to the licentious to knock off the ear\r\nof one angel, and scratch the face of another. Not an epitaph was\r\nleft to retrace the patriotic deeds of an upright statesman, or the\r\nmore brilliant exploits of a heroic warrior; not a memento, to record\r\nconjugal affection, filial piety, or grateful friendship. The\r\niconoclasts proceeded not with the impetuous fury of fanatics, but\r\nwith the extravagant foolery of atheistical buffoons.\r\n\r\nAll the gold and silver ornaments disappeared: a great part of them\r\nwere dissolved in the crucibles of the mint, after having been\r\npresented as a homage to the Convention, some of whose members danced\r\nthe _carmagnole_ with those who presented them at their bar, loaded\r\non the back of mules and asses, bedecked with all the emblems of\r\ncatholic worship; while several of the rubies, emeralds, &c. which\r\nhad formerly decorated the glory, beaming round the head of a Christ,\r\nwere afterwards seen glittering on the finger of the revolutionary\r\ncommittee-men.\r\n\r\nChaumette, an attorney, was the man who proclaimed atheism, and his\r\nexample had many imitators. It seemed the wish of that impious being\r\nto exile God himself from nature. He it was who imagined those\r\norgies, termed the festivals of reason. One of the most remarkable of\r\nthese festivals was celebrated in this very church of _St. Eustache_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mademoiselle Maillard, the singing heroine of the French\r\nopera, figured more than once as the goddess of reason, that divinity\r\nwas generally personified by some shameless female, who, if not a\r\nnotorious prostitute, was frequently little better. Her throne\r\noccupied the place of the altar; her supporters were chiefly drunken\r\nsoldiers, smoking their pipe; and before her, were a set of\r\nhalf-naked vagabonds, singing and dancing the _carmagnole_.\r\n\r\n\"In this church,\" says an eye-witness, \"the interior of the choir\r\nrepresented a landscape, decorated with cottages and clumps of trees.\r\nIn the distance were mysterious bowers, to which narrow paths led,\r\nthrough declivities formed of masses of artificial rock.\r\n\r\n\"The inside of the church presented the spectacle of a large\r\npublic-house. Round the choir were arranged tables, loaded with\r\nbottles, sausages, pies, pâtés, and other viands. On the altars of\r\nthe lateral chapels, sacrifices were made to luxury and gluttony;\r\nand the consecrated stones bore the disgusting marks of beastly\r\nintemperance.\r\n\r\n\"Guests crowded in at all doors: whoever came partook of this\r\nfestival: children thrust their hands into the dishes, and helped\r\nthemselves out of the bottles, as a sign of liberty; while the speedy\r\nconsequences of this freedom became a matter of amusement to grown\r\npersons in a similar state of ebriety. What a deplorable picture of\r\nthe people, who blindly obeyed the will of a few factious leaders!\r\n\r\n\"In other churches, balls were given; and, by way of shutting the\r\ndoor in the face of modesty, these were continued during the night,\r\nin order that, amidst the confusion of nocturnal revelry, those\r\ndesires which had been kindled during the day, might be freely\r\ngratified under the veil of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"The processions which accompanied these orgies, were no less\r\nattended with every species of atheistical frenzy. After feasting\r\ntheir eyes with the sacrifice of human victims, the Jacobin faction,\r\nor their satellites, followed the car of their impure goddess: next\r\ncame, in another car, a moving orchestra, composed of blind\r\nmusicians, a too faithful image of that Reason which was the object\r\nof their adoration.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of France, at that period, proves that religion being\r\ndetached from social order, there remained a frightful void, Which\r\nnothing could have filled up but its subsequent restoration. Without\r\nreligion, men become enemies to each other, criminals by principle,\r\nand bold violators of the laws; force is the only curb that can\r\nrestrain them. The inevitable consequence is, that anarchy and rapine\r\ndesolate the face of the earth, and reduce it to a heap of misfortune\r\nand ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 27, 1801._\r\n\r\nWhen we travel back in idea for the last ten years, and pass in\r\nreview the internal commotions which have distracted France during\r\nthat period, and the external struggle she has had to maintain for\r\nthe security of her independence, we cannot refuse our admiration to\r\nthe constancy which the French have manifested in forming\r\ninstitutions for the diffusion of knowledge, and repositories of\r\nobjects tending to the advancement of the arts and sciences. In this\r\nrespect, if we except the blood-thirsty reign of Robespierre, no\r\nclash of political interests, no change in the form or administration\r\nof the government, has relaxed their ardour, or slackened their\r\nperseverance. Whatever set of men have been in power, the arts and\r\nsciences have experienced almost uninterrupted protection.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the French themselves, the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES, in\r\nthe CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, may claim pre-eminence over every\r\nother repository of sculpture; but many persons may, probably, feel a\r\nsatisfaction more pure and unadulterated in viewing the\r\n\r\nMUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\nHere, neither do insignia of triumph call to mind the afflicting\r\nscenes of war, nor do emblems of conquest strike the eye of the\r\ntravelled visiter, and damp his enjoyment by blending with it bitter\r\nrecollections. Vandalism is the only enemy from whose attacks the\r\nmonuments, here assembled, have been rescued.\r\n\r\nThis Museum, which has, in fact, been formed out of the wrecks of the\r\nrevolutionary storm, merits particular attention. Although it was not\r\nopen to the public, for the first time, till the 15th of Fructidor,\r\nyear III (2nd of September 1795), its origin may be dated from 1790,\r\nwhen the Constituent Assembly, having decreed the possessions of the\r\nClergy to be national property, charged the _Committee of Alienation_\r\nto exert their vigilance for the preservation of all the monuments of\r\nthe arts, spread throughout the wide extent of the ecclesiastical\r\ndomains.\r\n\r\nThe philanthropic LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, (the last Duke of the family), as\r\nPresident of that committee, fixed on a number of artists and\r\nliterati to select such monuments as the committee were anxious to\r\npreserve. The municipality of Paris, being specially entrusted, by\r\nthe National Assembly, with the execution of this decree, also\r\nnominated several literati and artists of acknowledged merit to\r\nco-operate with the former in their researches and labours. Of this\r\nassociation was formed a commission, called _Commission des\r\nMonumens_. From that epoch, proper places were sought for the\r\nreception of the treasures which it was wished to save from\r\ndestruction. The _Committee of Alienation_ appointed the _ci-devant_\r\nmonastery of the _Petits Augustins_ for the monuments of sculpture\r\nand pictures, and those of the _Capucins, Grands Jesuites,_ and\r\n_Cordeliers_, for the books and manuscripts.\r\n\r\nBy these means, the monuments in the suppressed convents and churches\r\nwere, by degrees, collected in this monastery, which is situated in\r\nthe _Rue des Petits Augustins_, so named after that order of monks,\r\nwhose church here was founded, in 1613, by Marguerite de Valois,\r\nfirst wife of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nAt the same period, ALEXANDRE LENOIR was appointed, by the\r\nConstituent Assembly, director of this establishment. As I shall have\r\nfrequent occasion to mention the name of that estimable artist, I\r\nshall here content myself with observing, that the choice did honour\r\nto their judgment.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, under pretext of destroying every emblem of\r\nfeudality, the most celebrated master-pieces were consigned to ruin;\r\nbut the commission before-mentioned opportunely published\r\ninstructions respecting the means of preserving the valuable articles\r\nwhich they purposed to assemble.\r\n\r\nThe National Convention also gave indisputable proof of its regard\r\nfor the arts, by issuing several decrees in their favour. Its\r\n_Committee of Public Instruction_ created a commission, composed of\r\ndistinguished literati and artists of every class, for the purpose of\r\nkeeping a watchful eye over the preservation of the monuments of the\r\narts. The considerable number of memoirs, reports, and addresses,\r\ndiffused through the departments by this learned and scientific\r\nassociation, enlightened the people, and arrested the arm of those\r\nmodern Vandals who took a pleasure in mutilating the most admired\r\nstatues, tearing or defacing the most valuable pictures, and melting\r\ncasts of bronze of the most exquisite beauty.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous reports to which these acts of blind ignorance\r\ngave birth, three published by GRÉGOIRE, ex-bishop of Blois, claim\r\nparticular distinction no less on account of the taste and zeal which\r\nthey exhibit for the advancement of literature and the fine arts,\r\nthan for the invective with which they abound against the madness of\r\nirreligious barbarism. This last stroke, aptly applied, was the means\r\nof recovering many articles of value, and of preserving the monuments\r\nstill remaining in the provinces.\r\n\r\nIn these eventful times, LENOIR, the Conservator of the rising\r\nmuseum, collected, through his own indefatigable exertions, a\r\nconsiderable number of mausolea, statues, bas-reliefs, and busts of\r\nevery age and description. No sooner did a moment of tranquillity\r\nappear to be reestablished in this country, than he proposed to the\r\ngovernment to place all these monuments in historical and\r\nchronological order, by classing them, according to the age in which\r\nthey had been executed, in particular halls or apartments, and giving\r\nto each of these apartments the precise character peculiar to each\r\ncentury. This plan which, in its aggregate, united the history of the\r\nart and that of France, by means of her monuments, met with general\r\napprobation, and was accordingly adopted by the members of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThus, throughout this Museum, the architectural decorations of the\r\ndifferent apartments are of the age to which the monuments of\r\nSculpture, contained in each, belongs; and the light penetrates\r\nthrough windows of stained glass, from the designs of RAPHAEL,\r\nPRIMATICCIO, ALBERT DURER, LE SUEUR, &c., the production of the\r\nparticular century corresponding to that of the sculpture.\r\n\r\nCome then, let us visit this Museum, and endeavour to discriminate\r\nthe objects which may be most interesting both to the artist and\r\nhistorian. We first enter the\r\n\r\nANTI-CHAMBER.\r\n\r\nThis apartment presents itself to our inquisitive looks, as a Hall of\r\nIntroduction, which may not be unaptly compared to the preface of a\r\ngrand work. Here we behold a crowd of monuments, arranged\r\nmethodically, so as to prepare our eyes for tracing the different\r\nages through which we have to travel.\r\n\r\nWe first remark those altars, worn by the hand of Time, on which the\r\ntrading Gauls of the ancient _Lutetia_, now Paris, sacrificed to the\r\ngods in the time of Tiberius. Jupiter, Mars, Vulcan, Mercury, Venus,\r\nPan, Castor and Pollux, and the religious ceremonies here sculptured,\r\nare sufficient to attest that the Parisians were then idolaters, and\r\nfollowed the religion of the Romans, to whom they were become\r\ntributary. The Inscriptions on each of these monuments, which are\r\nfive in number, leave no doubt as to their authenticity, and the\r\nepoch of their erection.\r\n\r\nThese altars, five in number, are charged with bas-reliefs, and the\r\nfirst of them is inscribed with the following words in Latin.\r\n\r\n  TIB. CAESARE.\r\n  AVG. IOVI OPTVMO\r\n  MAXSVMO (_aram_) M.\r\n  NAVTAE. PARISIACI\r\n  PUBLICE POSIERVNT.\r\n\r\n_Tiberius Cæsar, having accepted or taken the name of Augustus, the\r\nnavigators (Nautæ) belonging to the city of Paris, publicly\r\nconsecrated this altar to Jupiter the most great and most good._\r\n\r\nIn 1711, these monuments were dug up from the choir of the cathedral\r\nof _Notre-Dame_, out of the foundations of the ancient church of\r\nParis, constructed by Childebert, on the ruins of a temple, formerly\r\ndedicated to Isis, which he caused to be demolished. Near them we see\r\nthe great goddess of the Germans figure under the name of Nehalennia,\r\nin honour of whom that people had erected a great number of\r\nmonuments, some of which were discovered in the year 1646, when the\r\nsea retired from the island of Walcheren.\r\n\r\nCapitals, charged with bas-reliefs, taken from a subterraneous\r\nbasilic, built by Pepin, have likewise been collected, and follow\r\nthose which I have just mentioned. Next comes the tomb of CLOVIS,\r\nwhich exhibits that prince lying at length; he is humbling himself\r\nbefore the Almighty, and seems to be asking him forgiveness for his\r\ncrimes. We likewise see those of CHILDEBERT and of the cruel\r\nCHILPERIC. The intaglio, relieved by inlaid pieces of Mosaic, of\r\nqueen FREDEGOND, has escaped the accidents of twelve centuries. Just\r\nHeaven! what powers have disappeared from the face of the earth since\r\nthat period! And to what reflections does not this image, still\r\nexisting of that impious woman, give birth in the mind of the\r\nphilosopher! CHARLEMAGNE, who was buried at Aix-la-Chapelle, seated\r\non a throne of gold, appears here, in a haughty attitude, with his\r\nsword in his hand, still to be giving laws to the world!\r\n\r\nAs might naturally be supposed, most of these figures have suffered\r\nmuch by the rude attacks of Time; but in spite of his indelible\r\nimpression, the unpolished hand of the sculptor is still\r\ndistinguishable, and betrays the degraded state of the arts during\r\nthe darkness of the middle ages. Let us pass into the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nHere we shall remark arches in the Gothic style, supported by thick\r\npillars, according to the architecture of that period. Ornaments, in\r\nthe form of _culs-de-lampe_, terminate the centre of the arches,\r\nwhich are painted in azure-blue, and charged with stars. When temples\r\nwere begun to be sheltered or covered, nations painted the inside of\r\nthe roof in this manner, in order to keep in view the image of the\r\ncelestial canopy to which they directed all their affections, and to\r\npreserve the memory of the ancient custom of offering up sacrifices\r\nto the divinity in the open air.\r\n\r\nHere the statue of LEWIS IX, surnamed the Saint, is placed near that\r\nof PHILIP, one of his sons, and of CHARLES, his brother, king of\r\nSicily, branded in history, by having, through his oppression, driven\r\nhis subjects into revolt, and caused the massacre of the French in\r\nthat island in 1277; a massacre well known by the name of the\r\n_Sicilian vespers_.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was the fashion, in those days, for kings themselves\r\nto be bearers at funerals. We are told by St. Foix, that the body of\r\nLEWIS, another son of the Saint, who died in 1662, aged 26, and whose\r\ncenotaph is here, was first carried to St. Denis, and thence to the\r\nabbey of Royaumont, where it was interred. \"The greatest lords of the\r\nkingdom,\" says he, \"alternately bore the coffin on their shoulders,\r\nand Henry III; king of England, carried it himself for a considerable\r\ntime, as feudatory of the crown.\"\r\n\r\nPHILIP III, too, above-mentioned, having brought to Paris the remains\r\nof his father from Tunis in Africa, carried them barefooted, on his\r\nshoulders, to St. Denis. Wherever he rested by the way, towers were\r\nerected in commemoration of this act of filial piety; but these have\r\nbeen destroyed since the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe casements of this hall, in the form of ogives, are ornamented\r\nwith stained glass of the first epoch of the invention of that art.\r\nWe now come to the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThis hall shews us the light, yet splendid architecture of the Arabs,\r\nintroduced into France in consequence of the Crusades. Here are the\r\nstatues of the kings that successively appeared in this age down to\r\nking JOHN, who was taken prisoner by Edward, the black prince, at the\r\nbattle of Poietiers. They are clad after the manner of their time,\r\nand lying at length on a stylobate, strewn with flower-de-luces.\r\nTwenty-two knights, each mounted on lions, armed cap-à-pié,\r\nrepresented of the natural size, and coloured, fill ogive niches\r\nornamented with Mosaic designs, relieved with gold, red, and blue.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of CHARLES V, surnamed the _Wise_, and of the worthy\r\nconstable, DU GUESCLIN, together with that of SANCERRE, his faithful\r\nfriend, rise in the middle of this apartment; which presents to the\r\neye all the magnificence of a Turkish mosque. After having quitted\r\nit, what a striking contrast do we not remark on entering the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY!\r\n\r\nColumns, arabesque ceilings charged with gilding, light pieces of\r\nsculpture applied on blue and violet grounds, imitating cameo, china,\r\nor enamel; every thing excites astonishment, and concurs in calling\r\nto mind the first epoch of the regeneration of the arts in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of the amateur are enlivened in this brilliant apartment:\r\nthey prepare him for the gratification which he is going to\r\nexperience at the sight of the beautiful monuments produced by the\r\nage, so renowned of Francis I. There, architecture predominates over\r\nsculpture; here, sculpture over architecture.\r\n\r\nThe genius of RAPHAEL paved the way to this impulse of regeneration:\r\nhe had recently produced the decorations of the Vatican; and the\r\nadmirable effect of these master-pieces of art, kindled an enthusiasm\r\nin the mind of the artists, who travelled. On their return to France,\r\nthey endeavoured to imitate them: in this attempt, JEAN JUSTE, a\r\nsculptor sent to Rome, at the expense of the Cardinal D'AMBOISE, was\r\nthe most succcessful.\r\n\r\nFirst, we behold the mausoleum of LOUIS D'ORLÉANS, victim of the\r\nfaction of the Duke of Burgundy, and that of his brother CHARLES, the\r\npoet. Near them is that of VALENTINE DE MILAN, the inconsolable wife\r\nof the former, who died through grief the year after she lost her\r\nhusband. As an emblem of her affliction, she took for her device a\r\nwatering-pot stooped, whence drops kept trickling in the form of\r\ntears. Let it not be imagined, however, that it was on account of his\r\nconstancy that this affectionate woman thus bewailed him till she\r\nfell a victim to her sorrow.\r\n\r\nLOUIS D'ORLÉANS was a great seducer of ladies of the court, and of\r\nthe highest rank too, says Brantome. Indeed, historians concur in\r\nstating that to a brilliant understanding, he joined the most\r\ncaptivating person. We accordingly find that the Dutchess of Burgundy\r\nand several others were by no means cruel to him; and he had been\r\nsupping tête-à-tête with Queen Isabeau de Bavière, when, in returning\r\nhome, he was assassinated on the twenty-third of November 1407. His\r\namorous intrigues at last proved fatal to the English, as you will\r\nlearn from the following story, related by the same author.\r\n\r\nOne morning, M. d'Orléans having in bed with him a woman of quality,\r\nwhose husband came to pay him an early visit, he concealed the lady's\r\nhead, while he exhibited the rest of her person to the contemplation\r\nof the unsuspecting intruder, at the same time forbidding him, as he\r\nvalued his life, to remove the sheet from her face. Now, the cream of\r\nthe jest was, that, on the following night, the good soul of a\r\nhusband, as he lay beside his dear, boasted to her that the Duke of\r\nOrleans had shewn him the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen:\r\nbut that for her face he could not tell what to say of it, as it was\r\nconcealed under the sheet. \"From this little intrigue,\" adds\r\nBrantome, \"sprang that brave and valiant bastard of Orleans, Count\r\nDunois, the pillar of France, and the scourge of the English.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see the statues of CHARLES VI, and of JANE of Burgundy. The\r\nformer being struck by a _coup de soleil_, became deranged in his\r\nintellects and imbecile, after having displayed great genius; he is\r\nrepresented with a pack of cards in his hand to denote that they were\r\nfirst invented for that prince's diversion. The latter was Dutchess\r\nof BEAUFORT, wife to the Duke, who commanded the English army against\r\nCharles VII, and as brother to our Henry IV, was appointed regent of\r\nFrance, during the minority of his nephew, Henry V.\r\n\r\nNext come those of RÉNÉE D'ORLÉANS, grand-daughter of the intrepid\r\nDunois; and of PHILIPPE DE COMMINES, celebrated by his memoirs of the\r\ntyrant, LEWIS XI, whose statue faces that of CHARLES VII, his father.\r\n\r\nThe image of JOAN OF ARC, whom that king had the baseness to suffer\r\nto perish, after she had maintained him on the throne, also figures\r\nin this hall with that of ISABEAU DE BAVIÈRE. The shameful death of\r\nthe Maid of Orleans, who, as every one knows, was, at the instigation\r\nof the English, condemned as a witch, and burnt alive at Rouen on the\r\n30th of May 1430, must inspire with indignation every honest\r\nEnglishman who reflects on this event, which will ever be a blot in\r\nthe page of our history. Isabeau affords a striking example of the\r\ninfluence of a queen's morals on the affections of the people. On her\r\nfirst arrival in Paris, she was crowned by angels, and received from\r\nthe burghers the most magnificent and costly presents. At her death,\r\nshe was so detested by the nation, that in order to convey her body\r\nprivately to St. Denis, it was embarked in a little skiff at\r\n_Port-Landri_, with directions to the waterman to deliver it to the\r\nabbot.\r\n\r\nThe superb tomb of LEWIS XII, placed in the middle of this apartment,\r\ndisplays great magnificence; and his statue, lying at length, which\r\nrepresents him in a state of death, recalls to mind that moment so\r\ngrievous to the French people, who exclaimed, in following his\r\nfuneral procession to St. Denis, \"Our good king Lewis XII is dead,\r\nand we have lost our father.\"\r\n\r\nThe historian delights to record a noble trait of that prince's\r\ncharacter. Lewis XII had been taken prisoner at the battle of St.\r\nAubin by Louis de la Trimouille, who, fearing the resentment of the\r\nnew king, and wishing to excuse himself for his conduct, received\r\nthis magnanimous reply: \"It is not for the king of France to revenge\r\nthe quarrels of the duke of Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nThe statue of PIERRE DE NAVARRE, son of Charles the _Bad_, seems\r\nplaced here to form in the mind of the spectator a contrast between\r\nhis father and Lewis XII. The tragical end of Charles is of a nature\r\nto fix attention, and affords an excellent subject for a pencil like\r\nthat of Fuseli.\r\n\r\nCharles the _Bad_, having fallen into such a state of decay that he\r\ncould not make use of his limbs, consulted his physician, who ordered\r\nhim to be wrapped up from head to foot, in a linen cloth impregnated\r\nwith brandy, so that he might be inclosed in it to the very neck as\r\nin a sack. It was night when this remedy was administered. One of the\r\nfemale attendants of the palace, charged to sew up the cloth that\r\ncontained the patient, having come to the neck, the fixed point where\r\nshe was to finish her seam, made a knot according to custom; but as\r\nthere was still remaining an end of thread, instead of cutting it as\r\nusual with scissars, she had recourse to the candle, which\r\nimmediately set fire to the whole cloth. Being terrified, she ran\r\naway, and abandoned the king, who was thus burnt alive in his own\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture for the moralist is this assemblage of persons,\r\ncelebrated either for their errors, crimes, talents, or virtues!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 28, 1801_.\r\n\r\nConceiving how interested you (who are not only a connoisseur, but an\r\nF.A.S.) must feel in contemplating the only repository in the world,\r\nI believe, which contains such a chronological history of the art of\r\nsculpture, I lose no time in conducting you to complete our survey of\r\nthe MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS in the _Rue des Petits Augustins_.\r\n\r\nHaving examined those of the fifteenth century, during our former\r\nvisit, we are at length arrived at the age of the Fine Arts in\r\nFrance, and now enter the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n  \"But see! each muse in LEO'S golden days,\r\n  Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays;\r\n  Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,\r\n  Shakes off the dust, and rears his reverend head;\r\n  Then Sculpture and her sister arts revive,\r\n  Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live.\"\r\n\r\nThese beautiful lines of Pope immediately occur to the mind, on\r\nconsidering that, in Italy, the Great LEO, by the encouragement which\r\nhe gave to men of talents, had considerably increased the number of\r\nmaster-pieces; when the taste for the Fine Arts, after their previous\r\nrevival by the Medici, having spread throughout that country, began\r\nto dawn in France about the end of the fifteenth century. By\r\nprogressive steps, the efforts made by the French artists to emulate\r\ntheir masters, attained, towards the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\na perfection which has since fixed the attention of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn entering this hall, which is consecrated to that period, the\r\namateur finds his genius inflamed. What a deep impression does not\r\nthe perfection of the numerous monuments which it has produced make\r\non his imagination! First, he admires the beautiful tomb erected to\r\nthe memory of FRANCIS I, the restorer of literature and the arts;\r\nwho, by inviting to his court LEONARDO DA VINCI and PRIMATICCIO, and\r\nestablishing schools and manufactories, consolidated the great work\r\nof their regeneration.\r\n\r\n\"Curse the monks!\" exclaimed I, on surveying this magnificent\r\nmonument, constructed in 1550, from the designs of the celebrated\r\nPHILIBERT DE L'ORME. \"Who cannot but regret,\" continued I to myself,\r\n\"that so gallant a knight as Francis I. should fall a victim to that\r\nbaneful disease which strikes at the very sources of generation? Who\r\ncannot but feel indignant that so generous a prince, whose first\r\nmaxim was, that _true magnanimity consisted in the forgiveness of\r\ninjuries, and pusillanimity in the prosecution of revenge_, should\r\nowe his death to the diabolical machinations of a filthy friar?\" Yet,\r\nso it was; the circumstances are as follows:\r\n\r\nFrancis I. was smitten by the charms of the wife of one Lunel, a\r\ndealer in iron. A Spanish chaplain, belonging to the army of the\r\nEmperor Charles V, passing through Paris in order to repair to\r\nFlayers, threw himself in this man's way, and worked on his mind till\r\nhe had made him a complete fanatic: \"Your king,\" said the friar,\r\n\"protects Lutheranism in Germany, and will soon introduce it into\r\nFrance. Be revenged on him and your wife, by serving religion.\r\nCommunicate to him that disease for which no certain remedy is yet\r\nknown.\"--\"And how am I to give it to him?\" replied Lunel; \"neither I\r\nnor my wife have it.\"--\"But I have,\" rejoined the monk: \"I hold up my\r\nhand and swear it. Introduce me only for one half-hour by night, into\r\nyour place, by the side of your faithless fair, and I will answer for\r\nthe rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest having prevailed on Lunel to consent to his scheme, went\r\nto a place where he was sure to catch the infection, and, by means of\r\nLunel's wife, he communicated it to the king. Being previously in\r\npossession of a secret remedy, the monk cured himself in a short\r\ntime; the poor woman died at the expiration of a month; and Francis\r\nI, after having languished for three or four years, at length, in\r\n1547, sunk under the weight of a disorder then generally considered\r\nas incurable.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the VALOIS, erected in honour of that family, by\r\nCatherine de Medicis, soon after the death of Henry II, is one of the\r\nmasterpieces of GERMAIN PILON. In the execution of this beautiful\r\nmonument, that famous artist has found means to combine the\r\ncorrectness of style of Michael Angelo with the grace of Primaticcio.\r\nTo the countenance of HENRY and CATHERINE, who are represented in a\r\nstate of death, lying as on a bed, he has imparted an expression of\r\nsensibility truly affecting.\r\n\r\nNext comes the tomb of DIANE DE POITIERS, that celebrated beauty, who\r\ndisplayed equal judgment in the management of State affairs and in\r\nthe delicacy of her attachments; who at the age of 40, captivated\r\nking Henry II, when only 18; and, who, though near 60 at the death of\r\nthat prince, had never ceased to preserve the same empire over his\r\nheart. At the age of fourteen, she was married to Louis de Brézé,\r\ngrand seneschal of Normandy, and died in April 1506, aged 66.\r\n\r\nBrantome, who saw her not long before her death, when she had just\r\nrecovered from the confinement of a broken leg, and had experienced\r\ntroubles sufficient to lessen her charms, thus expresses himself:\r\n\"Six months ago, when I met her, she was still so beautiful that I\r\nknow not any heart of adamant which would not have been moved at the\r\nsight of her.\"--To give you a perfect idea of her person, take this\r\nlaconic description, which is not one of fancy, but collected from\r\nthe best historians.\r\n\r\nHer jet black hair formed a striking contrast to her lily complexion.\r\nOn her cheeks faintly blushed the budding rose. Her teeth vied with\r\nivory itself in whiteness: in a word, her form was as elegant as her\r\ndeportment was graceful.\r\n\r\nBy way of lesson to the belles of the present day, let them be told\r\nthat DIANE DE POITIERS was never ill, nor affected indisposition. In\r\nthe severity of the winter, she daily washed her face with\r\nspring-water, and never had recourse to cosmetics.----\"What pity,\"\r\nsays Brantome, \"that earth should cover so beautiful a woman!\"\r\n\r\nNo man, indeed, who sympathizes with the foibles of human nature, can\r\ncontemplate the tomb of DIANE DE POITIERS, and reflect on her\r\nnumerous virtues and attractions, without adopting the sentiments of\r\nBrantome, and feeling his breast glow with admiration.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary woman afforded the most signal protection to\r\nliterati and men of genius, and was, in fact, no less distinguished\r\nfor the qualities of her heart than for the beauty of her person.\r\n\"She was extremely good-humoured, charitable, and humane,\" continues\r\nBrantome \"The people of France ought to pray to God that the female\r\nfavourite of every chief magistrate of their country may resemble\r\nthis amiable frail one.\"\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the elevation of her sentiments, I shall conclude by\r\nquoting to you the spirited reply DIANE made to Henry II, who, by\r\ndint of royal authority, wished to legitimate a daughter he had by\r\nher: \"I am of a birth,\" said she, \"to have had lawful children by\r\nyou. I have been your mistress, because I loved you. I will never\r\nsuffer a decree to declare me your concubine.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful group of the modest Graces, and that representing\r\nDiana, accompanied by her dogs Procion and Syrius, sculptured by Jean\r\nGougeon, to serve as the decoration of a fountain in the park of\r\nDIANE DE POITIERS at Anet, attracts the attention of the connoisseur.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of GOUGEON, composed of his own works, and erected to the\r\nmemory of that great artist, through gratitude, is, undoubtedly, a\r\nhomage which he justly deserved. This French Phidias was a Calvinist,\r\nand one of the numerous victims of St. Bartholomew's day, being shot\r\non his scaffold, as he was at work on the _Louvre_, the 24th of\r\nAugust 1572. Here too we behold the statues of BIRAGUE and of the\r\nGONDI, those atrocious wretches who, together with Catherine de\r\nMedicis, plotted that infamous massacre; while CHARLES IX, no less\r\ncriminal, here exhibits on his features the stings of a guilty\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThe man that has a taste for learning, gladly turns his eye from this\r\nhorde of miscreants, to fix it on the statue of CLAUDE-CATHERINE DE\r\nCLERMONT-TONNERRE, who was so conversant in the dead languages as to\r\nbear away the palm from Birague and Chiveray, in a speech which she\r\ncomposed and spoke in Latin, at twenty-four hours' notice, in answer\r\nto the ambassadors who tendered the crown of Poland to Charles IX.\r\n\r\nIf the friend of the arts examine the beautiful portico erected by\r\nPhilibert de l'Orme, on the banks of the Eure, for Diane de Poitiers,\r\ncomposed of the three orders of architecture, placed the one above\r\nthe other, and forming altogether an elevation of sixty feet, he will\r\nbe amazed to learn that this superb monument constructed at Anet,\r\ntwenty leagues distant from Paris, was removed thence, and\r\nre-established in this Museum, by the indefatigable conservator,\r\nLENOIR.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the apartment containing the master-pieces brought to\r\nlight by Francis I, the next we reach is the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nWhat a crowd of celebrated men contained in the temple consecrated to\r\nvirtue, courage, and talents!\r\n\r\nThere, I behold TURENNE, CONDÉ, MONTAUSIER, COLBERT, MOLIÈRE,\r\nCORNEILLE, LA FONTAINE, RACINE, FÉNÉLON, and BOILEAU. The great LEWIS\r\nXIV, placed in the middle of this hall, seems to become still greater\r\nnear those immortal geniuses.\r\n\r\nFarther on, we see the statue of the implacable RICHELIEU,\r\nrepresented expiring in the arms of Religion, while Science is\r\nweeping at his feet. Ye Gods! what a prostitution of talent! This is\r\nthe master-piece of GIRARDON; but, in point of execution, many\r\nconnoisseurs prefer the mausoleum of the crafty MAZARIN, whom\r\nCOYZEVOX has pourtrayed in a supplicating posture.\r\n\r\nLEWIS XIII, surnamed the _Just_, less great than his illustrious\r\nsubject, DE THOU, casts down his eyes in the presence of his\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nThe mausolea of LE BRUN, LULLI, and JÉROME BIGNON, the honour, the\r\nlove, and the example of his age, terminate the series of monuments\r\nof that epoch, still more remarkable for its literati than its\r\nartists. We at last come to the\r\n\r\nHALL OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nHere we admire the statues of MONTESQUIEU, FONTENELLE, VOLTAIRE,\r\nROUSSEAU, HELVÉTIUS, CRÉBILLON, PIRON, &c. &c. The tombs of the\r\nlearned MAUPERTUIS and CAYLUS, and also that of Marshal D'HARCOURT,\r\ngive a perfect idea of the state of degradation into which the art of\r\ndesign had fallen at the beginning of this century; but the new\r\nproductions which decorate the extremity of this spacious hall are\r\nsufficient to prove to what degree the absolute will of a great\r\ngenius can influence the progress of the arts, as well as of the\r\nsciences. VIEN and DAVID appeared, and the art was regenerated.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we find a statue, as large as life, representing Christ\r\nleaning on a pillar, executed  by MICHAEL ANGELO STODTZ. I notice\r\nthis statue merely to observe, that the original, from which it is\r\ntaken, is to be seen at Rome, in the _Chiesa della Minerva_ where it\r\nis held in such extraordinary veneration, that the great toe-nail of\r\nthe right foot having been entirely worn away by the repeated kisses\r\nof the faithful, one of silver had been substituted. At length this\r\nsecond nail having been likewise worn away, a third was placed, of\r\ncopper, which is already somewhat worn. It was sculptured by MICHAEL\r\nANGELO BUONAROTI.\r\n\r\nWe experience an emotion of regret at the aspect of the handsome\r\nmonument by MICHALLON, on learning that it was erected to the memory\r\nof young DROUAIS, a skilful and amiable artist, stopped by death, in\r\n1788, during his brilliant career, at the early age of 24. He has\r\nleft behind him three historical pictures, which are so many\r\nmaster-pieces.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful statue of the youthful Cyparissus, by CHAUDET, the most\r\neminent French sculptor, reminds us of the full and elegant form of\r\nthe fine Greek Bacchus, which decorates the peristyle of the\r\nantichamber or Hall of Introduction.\r\n\r\nThus the amateur and the student will find, in this Museum, an\r\nuninterrupted chronology of monuments, both antique and modern,\r\nbeginning by those of ancient Greece, whose date goes back to two\r\nthousand five hundred years before our era, to examine those of the\r\nRomans, of the Lower Empire, of the Gauls, and thence pass to the\r\nfirst epoch of the French monarchy, and at length follow all the\r\ngradations through which the art has passed from its cradle to its\r\ndecrepitude. The whole of this grand establishment is terminated by a\r\nspacious garden, which is converted into an\r\n\r\nELYSIUM.\r\n\r\nThere, on a verdant lawn, amid firs, cypresses, poplars, and weeping\r\nwillows, repose the ashes of the illustrious poets, MOLIÈRE, LA\r\nFONTAINE, BOILEAU, &c.; of the learned DESCARTES, MABILLON,\r\nMONTFAUCON, &c., inclosed in sarcophagi; there, they still receive\r\nthe homage which mankind owe to talents and virtue.\r\n\r\nBut hold! mark the sepulchre of the learned and tender HÉLOÏSE. Her\r\nremains, though formerly conjoined to those of her lover, were\r\nsubsequently separated, and after a lapse of three hundred years,\r\nthey are now reassembled.\r\n\r\n  Here one kind grave unites their hapless name,\r\n  And grafts her love immortal on his fame.\r\n\r\nWith a smile seated on her lips, HÉLOÏSE seems to be sighing for the\r\nobject of her glowing affection: while the unfortunate ABÉLARD,\r\ncoldly reclined, is still commenting on the Trinity. The _Paraclete_,\r\nhaving been sold and demolished, LENOIR, with all the sensibility of\r\nan admirer of genius, withdrew the bones of ABÉLARD and HÉLOÏSE from\r\nthat monastery, and placed them here in a sepulchral chapel, partly\r\nconstructed from the remains of their ancient habitation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS. When completed, for some\r\nvaluable specimens of the arts slill remain to be added, it will be\r\none of the most interesting establishments in Paris, and perhaps in\r\nEurope, especially if considered in regard to the improvement of\r\nmodern sculpture, and, I may add, architecture. No building can be\r\nbetter adapted than a monastery for an establishment of this nature.\r\nThe solemn gloom of cloisters suits the temper of the mind, when we\r\nreflect on the mortality incident to a succession of ages, and the\r\nmelancholy which it inspires, is in perfect unison with our feelings,\r\nwhen we contemplate the sepulchral monuments that recall to our\r\nmemory the actions of the illustrious departed.\r\n\r\nThis Museum is very extensive, the three courts and large garden,\r\nwhich at present compose the whole of its premises, occupying a space\r\nof three thousand seven hundred and sixty-two toises. LENOIR,\r\nhowever, has recently presented to the First Consul a plan for\r\nenlarging it, without any additional expense of building, by adding\r\nto it the neighbouring _Hôtel de Bouillon_. He proposes that there\r\nshould be a new entrance by the quay, exhibiting a spacious court,\r\ndecorated with statues, erected in regular order; and that the\r\napartments on the ground-floor should be appropriated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To a collection of portraits of all the celebrated men of France.\r\n\r\n2. To a chronological series of armour of all ages.\r\n\r\n3. To a complete collection of French medals.\r\n\r\n4. To a library, solely formed of the books necessary for obtaining a\r\nknowledge of the monuments contained in this Museum.\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the mutilated state in which most of these monuments\r\nwere found at the first formation of this interesting establishment,\r\nand view the perfection in which they now appear; when I remark the\r\ntaste and judgment displayed in the distribution and interior\r\narrangement of the different apartments of this rich museum; when I\r\nlearn, from the printed documents on the subject, the strict economy\r\nwhich has been observed in the acquisition or restoration of a great\r\nnumber of monuments, the more valuable as they illustrate the history\r\nof the arts; I confess that I find myself at a loss which most to\r\nadmire in the Conservator, his courage, zeal, perseverance, or\r\ndiscrimination. Indeed, nothing but an assemblage of those qualities\r\ncould have overcome the difficulties and obstacles which he has\r\nsurmounted.\r\n\r\nI shall add that LENOIR'S obliging disposition and amenity of manners\r\nequally entitle him to the gratitude and esteem of the connoisseur,\r\nthe student, or the inquisitive stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 1, 1801_.\r\n\r\nI was highly gratified the other day on finding myself in company\r\nwith some of those men whom (to borrow Lord Thurlow's expression, in\r\nspeaking of Warren Hastings,) I have known only as I know Alexander,\r\nby the greatness of their exploits; men whose names will be\r\ntransmitted to posterity, and shine with distinguished lustre in the\r\nmilitary annals of France.\r\n\r\nGeneral A----y had already invited me to dine with him, in order to\r\nmeet General B----r; but, on the day fixed, the latter, as minister\r\nfor the war department, being under the necessity of entertaining\r\nLord Cornwallis, the party was postponed till the 8th of Frimaire,\r\n(20th of November), when, in addition to General B----r, General\r\nA----y had assembled at his table several men of note. Among others,\r\nwere General M----rd, who commanded the right wing of the army of\r\nNaples under Macdonald, in which he distinguished himself as a brave\r\nsoldier; and D----ttes, physician in chief to the army of the East.\r\nThis officer of health, as medical men are here denominated, is\r\nlately returned from Egypt, where his skill and attention to his\r\nprofessional duties gained him universal admiration.\r\n\r\nIn society so agreeable, time passed away rapidly till General B----r\r\narrived. It was late, that is about seven o'clock, though the\r\ninvitation expressed five precisely, as the hour of dinner. But, in\r\nParis, a minister is always supposed to be detained on official\r\nbusiness of a nature paramount to every other consideraton. On my\r\nbeing introduced to General B----r, he immediately entered into\r\nconversation with me concerning Lord Cornwallis, whom he had known in\r\nthe American war, having served in the staff of Rochambeau at the\r\nsiege of Yorktown. As far back as that period B----r signalized\r\nhimself by his skill in military science. It was impossible to\r\ncontemplate these distinguished officers without calling to mind how\r\ngreatly their country was indebted to the exertion of their talents\r\non various important occasions. These recollections led me to admire\r\nthat wisdom which had placed them in stations for which they had\r\nproved themselves so eminently qualified. In England, places are\r\ngenerally sought for men; in France, men are sought for places.\r\n\r\nAt seven, dinner was announced, and an excellent one it was, both in\r\nquality and quantity. _Presto_ was the word, and all the guests\r\nseemed habituated to expedition. The difference between the duration\r\nof such a repast at this day, and what it was before the revolution,\r\nshews how constantly men become the slaves of fashion. Had BONAPARTE\r\nresembled Lucullus in being addicted to the pleasures of the festive\r\nboard, I make no doubt that it would have been the height of _ton_ to\r\nsit quietly two or three hours after dinner. But the Chief Consul is\r\nsaid to be temperate, almost to abstemiousness; he rises from table\r\nin less than half an hour; and that mode is now almost universal in\r\nParis, especially among the great men in office. Two elegant courses\r\nand a desert were presently dispatched; the whole time employed in\r\neating I know not how many good dishes, and drinking a variety of\r\nchoice wines, not exceeding thirty-five minutes. At the end of the\r\nrepast, coffee was presented to the company in an adjoining room,\r\nafter which the opera of _Tarare_ was the attraction of the evening.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned to you that General A----y had put into my\r\nhand _L'Histoire du Canal du Midi_, written by himself. From a\r\nperusal of this interesting work, it appears that one of his\r\nancestors[1] was the first who conceived the idea of that canal,\r\nwhich was not only planned by him, but entirely completed under his\r\nimmediate direction. Having communicated his plan to Riquet, the\r\nlatter submited it to Colbert, and, on its being approved by Lewis\r\nXIV, became _contractor_ for all the works of that celebrated\r\nundertaking, which he did not live to see finished. Riquet, however,\r\nnot content with having derived from the undertaking every advantage\r\nof honour and emolument, greedily snatched from the original\r\nprojector the meed of fame, so dearly earned by the unremitting\r\nlabour of thirty successive years. These facts are set forth in the\r\nclearest light in the above-mentioned work, in which I was carefully\r\nexamining General A----y's plans for the improvement of this famous\r\ncanal, when I was most agreeably interrupted.\r\n\r\nI had expressed to the General a wish to know the nature of the\r\nestablishment of which he is the director, at the same time apprizing\r\nhim that this wish did not extend to any thing that could not with\r\npropriety be made public. He obligingly promised that I should be\r\ngratified, and this morning I received ftom him a very friendly\r\nletter, accompanied by the following account of the\r\n\r\nDÉPÔT DE LA GUERRE.\r\n\r\nThe general _Dépôt_ or repository of maps and plans of war, &c, &c,\r\nwas established by LOUVOIS, in 1688. This was the celebrated period\r\nwhen France, having attained the highest degree of splendour, secured\r\nher glory by the results of an administration enlightened in all its\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of its institution, the _Dépôt de la guerre_ was no\r\nmore than archives, where were collected, and preserved with order,\r\nthe memoirs of the generals, their correspondence, the accounts yet\r\nimperfect, and the traces of anterior military operations.\r\n\r\nThe numerous resources afforded by this collection alone, the\r\nassistance and advantages derived from it on every occasion, when it\r\nwas necessary to investigate a military system, or determine an\r\nimportant operation, suggested the idea of assembling it under a form\r\nand classification more methodical. Greater attention and exactness\r\nwere exerted in enriching the _Dépôt_ with every thing that might\r\ncomplete the theoretical works and practical elucidations of all the\r\nbranches of the military art,\r\n\r\nMarshal DE MAILLEBOIS, who was appointed director of this\r\nestablishment in 1730, was one of the first authors of the present\r\nexisting order. The classification at first consisted only in forming\r\nregisters of the correspondence of the generals, according to date,\r\ndistinguishing it by _different wars_. It was divided into two parts,\r\nthe former containing the letters of the generals; and the latter,\r\nthe minutes or originals of the answers of the king and his\r\nministers. To each volume was added a summary of the contents, and,\r\nin regular succession, the journal of the military operations of the\r\nyear. These volumes, to the number of upwards of two thousand seven\r\nhundred, contain documents from the eleventh century to the close of\r\nthe last American war; but the series is perfect only from the year\r\n1631. This was a valuable mine for a historiographer to explore; and,\r\nindeed, it is well known that the _Memoirs of Turenne and of Condé_,\r\nthe _History of the war of 1741_, and part of the fragments of the\r\n_Essay on the Manners and History of Nations_, by Voltaire, were\r\ncompiled and digested from the original letters and memoirs preserved\r\nin the _Dépôt de la guerre_.\r\n\r\nGeographical engineers did not then exist as a corps. Topography was\r\npractised by insulated officers, impelled thereto by the rather\r\nsuperficial study of the mathematics and a taste for drawing; because\r\nit was for them a mean of obtaining more advantageous employments in\r\nthe staffs of the armies: but the want of a central point, the\r\ndifference of systems and methods, not admitting of directing the\r\noperations to one same principle, as well as to one same object,\r\ntopography, little encouraged, was making but a slow progress, when\r\nM. DE CHOISEUIL established, as a particular corps, the officers who\r\nhad applied themselves to the practice of that science. The _Dépôt_\r\nwas charged to direct and assemble the labours of the new corps. This\r\nauthority doubled the utility of the _Dépôt_: its results had the\r\nmost powerful influence during the war from 1757 to 1763.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General De VAULT, who had succeeded Marshal De MAILLEBOIS\r\nas director of the _Dépôt de la guerre_, conceived, and executed a\r\nplan, destined to render still more familiar and secure the numerous\r\ndocuments collected in this establishment. He first retrenched from\r\nthe _Military Correspondences and Memoirs_ all tedious repetitions\r\nand unnecessary details; he then classed the remainder under the head\r\nof a different army or operation, without subjecting himself to any\r\nother order than a simple chronology; but he caused each volume to be\r\npreceded by a very succinct, historical summary, in order to enable\r\nthe reader to seize the essence of the original memoirs and\r\ndocuments, the text of which was faithfully copied in the body of\r\neach volume, In this manner did he arrange all the military events\r\nfrom the German war in 1677 to the peace of 1763. This analysis forms\r\none hundred and twenty five volumes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive how much more interesting these historical\r\nvolumes became by the addition, which took place about the same\r\nepoch, of the labours of the geographical engineers employed in the\r\narmies. The military men having it at the same time in his power to\r\nfollow the combinations of the generals with the execution of their\r\nplans, imbibes, without difficulty, the principles followed by great\r\ncaptains, or improves himself from the exact account of the errors\r\nand faults which it is so natural to commit on critical occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen all the establishments of the old _régime_ were tottering, or\r\nthreatened by the revolutionary storm, measures were suggested for\r\npreserving the _Dépôt de la guerre_, and, towards the end of 1791, it\r\nwas transferred from Versailles to Paris. Presently the new system of\r\ngovernment, the war declared against the emperor, and the foreseen\r\nconflagration of Europe, concurred to give a new importance to this\r\nestablishment. Alone, amidst the general overthrow, it had preserved\r\na valuable collection of the military and topographical labours of\r\nthe monarchy, of manuscripts of the greatest importance, and a body\r\nof information of every kind respecting the resources, and the\r\ncountry, of the powers already hostile, or on the point of becoming\r\nso. All the utility which might result from the _Dépôt_ was then\r\nfelt, and it was thought necessary to give it a new organization.[2]\r\n\r\nThe _Dépôt de la guerre_, however, would have attained but\r\nimperfectly the object of its institution, had there not been added\r\nto its topographical treasure, the richest, as well as the finest,\r\ncollection in Europe of every geographical work held in any\r\nestimation. The first epochs of the revolution greatly facilitated\r\nthe increase of its riches of that description. The general impulse,\r\nimprinted on the mind of the French nation, prompted every will\r\ntowards useful sacrifices. Private cabinets in possession of the\r\nscarcest maps, gave them up to the government, The suppression of the\r\nmonasteries and abbeys caused to flow to the centre the geographical\r\nriches which they preserved in an obscurity hurtful to the progress\r\nof that important science: and thus the _Dépôt de la guerre_ obtained\r\none of the richest collections in Europe.[3] The government, besides,\r\ncompleted it by the delivery of the great map of France by CASSINI,\r\nbegun in 1750, together with all the materials forming the elements\r\nof that grand work. It is painful to add that not long before that\r\nperiod (in 1791) the corps of geographical engineers, which alone\r\ncould give utility to such valuable materials had been suppressed.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the sudden changes in the administrative system had\r\ndispersed the learned societies employed in astronomy, or the\r\nmathematical sciences. The _National Observatory_ was disused. The\r\ncelebrated astronomers attached to it had no rallying point: they\r\ncould not devote themselves to their labours but amidst the greatest\r\ndifficulties; the salary allowed to them was not paid; the numerous\r\nobservations, continued for two centuries, were on the point of being\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nThe _Dépôt de la guerre_ then became the asylum of those estimable\r\nmen. This establishment excited and obtained the reverification of\r\nthe measure of an arc of the meridian, in order to serve as a basis\r\nfor the uniformity of the weights and measures which the government\r\nwished to establish.\r\n\r\nMÉCHAIN, DELAMBRE, NOUET, TRANCHOT, and PERNY were dispatched to\r\ndifferent places from Barcelona to Dunkirk. After having established\r\nat each extremity of this line a base, measured with the greatest\r\nexactness, they were afterwards to advance their triangles, in order\r\nto ascend to the middle point of the line. This operation, which has\r\nserved for rectifying a few errors that the want of perfection in the\r\ninstruments had occasioned to be introduced into the measure of the\r\nmeridian of CASSINI, may be reckoned one of the most celebrated works\r\nwhich have distinguished the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the system of administration conformably to the\r\nconstitution of the year III (1795) separated the various elements\r\nwhich the _Dépôt de la guerre_ had found means to preserve. The\r\n_Board of Longitude_ was established; the _National Institute_ was\r\nformed to supply the place of the _Academy of Sciences_, &c. The\r\n_Dépôt de la guerre_ was restored solely to its ancient prerogatives.\r\nTwo years before, it had been under the necessity of forming new\r\ngeographical engineers and it succeeded in carrying the number\r\nsufficiently high to suffice for the wants of the fourteen armies\r\nwhich France had afterwards on foot.[5] These officers being employed\r\nin the service of the staffs, no important work was undertaken. But,\r\nsince the 18th of Brumaire, year VIII, (9th of November, 1799) the\r\nConsuls of the Republic have bestowed particular attention on\r\ngeographical and topographical operations. The new limits of the\r\nFrench territory require that the map of it should be continued; and\r\nthe new political system, resulting from the general pacification,\r\nrenders necessary the exact knowledge of the states of the allies of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nThe _Dépôt de la guerre_ forms various sections of geographers, who\r\nare at present employed in constructing accurate maps of the four\r\nunited departments. Piedmont, Savoy, Helvetia, and the part of Italy\r\ncomprised between the Adige and the Adda. One section, in conjunction\r\nwith the Bavarian engineers, is constructing a topographical map of\r\nBavaria: another section is carrying into execution the military\r\nsurveys, and other topographical labours, ordered by General MOREAU\r\nfor the purpose of forming a map of Suabia.\r\n\r\nThe _Dépôt_ has just published an excellent map of the Tyrol, reduced\r\nfrom that of PAYSAN, and to which have been added the observations\r\nmade by Chevaliers DUPAY and LA LUCERNE. It has caused to be resumed\r\nthe continuation of the superb map of the environs of Versailles,\r\ncalled _La carte des chasses_, a master-piece of topography and\r\nexecution in all the arts relating to that science. Since the year V\r\n(1795), it has also formed a library composed of upwards of eight\r\nthousand volumes or manuscripts, the most rare, as well as the most\r\nesteemed, respecting every branch of the military art in general.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in the preceding account, General A----y, with that modesty\r\nwhich is the characteristic of a superior mind, has been totally\r\nsilent respecting his own indefatigable exertions, I have learned\r\nfrom the best authority, that France is soon likely to derive very\r\nconsiderable advantages from the activity and talent introduced by\r\nhim, as director, into every branch of the _Dépôt de la guerre_, and\r\nof which he has afforded in his own person an illustrious example.\r\n\r\nIn giving an impulse to the interior labours of the _Dépôt_, the sole\r\nobject of General A----y is to make this establishment lose its\r\n_paralyzing_ destination of archives, in which, from time to time,\r\nliterati might come to collect information concerning some periods of\r\nnational or foreign history. He is of opinion that these materials\r\nought to be drawn from oblivion, and brought into action by those\r\nvery persons who, having the experience of war, are better enabled\r\nthan any others to arrange its elements. Instruction and method being\r\nthe foundations of a good administration, of the application of an\r\nart and of a science, as well as of their improvement, he has\r\nconceived the idea of uniting in a classical work the exposition of\r\nthe knowledge necessary for the direction of the _Dépôt_, for\r\ngeographical engineers, staff-officers, military men in general, and\r\nhistorians. This, then, is the object of the _Mémomorial du Dépôt de\r\nla guerre_, a periodical work, now in hand, which will become the\r\nguide of every establishment of this nature[6], by directing with\r\nmethod the various labours used in the application of mathematical\r\nand physical sciences to topography, and to that art which, of all\r\nothers, has the greatest influence on the destiny of empires: I mean\r\nthe art military. The improvements of which it is still susceptible\r\nwill be pointed out in the _Mémorial_, and every new idea proposed on\r\nthe subject will there be critically investigated.\r\n\r\nIn transcribing General A----y's sketch of this extremely-interesting\r\nestablishment, I cannot but reflect on the striking contrast that it\r\npresents, in point of geographical riches, even half a century ago,\r\nto the disgraceful poverty, in that line, which, about the same\r\nperiod, prevailed in England, and was severely felt in the planning\r\nof our military expeditions.\r\n\r\nI remember to have been told by the late Lord Howe, that, when he was\r\ncaptain of the Magnanime at Plymouth, and was sent for express to\r\nLondon, in the year 1757, in order to command the naval part of an\r\nexpedition to the coast of France, George II, and the whole cabinet\r\ncouncil, seemed very much astonished at his requiring the production\r\nof a map of that part of the enemy's coast against which the\r\nexpedition was intended. Neither in the apartment where the council\r\nsat, nor in any adjoining one, was any such document; even in the\r\nAdmiralty-office no other than an indifferent map of the coast could\r\nbe found: as for the adjacent country, it was so little known in\r\nEngland, that, when the British troops landed, their commander was\r\nignorant of the distance of the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\nOf late years, indeed, we have ordered these matters better; but, to\r\njudge from circumstances, it should seem that we are still extremely\r\ndeficient in geographical and topographical knowledge; though we are\r\nnot quite so ill informed as in the time of a certain duke, who, when\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury, asked in what part of Germany was the\r\nOhio?\r\n\r\nP.S. In order to give you, at one view, a complete idea of the\r\ncollections of the _Dépôt de la guerre_, and of what they have\r\nfurnished during the war for the service of the government and of the\r\narmies, I shall end my letter by stating that, independently of eight\r\nthousand chosen volumes, among which is a valuable collection of\r\natlases, of two thousand seven hundred volumes of old archives, and\r\nof upwards of nine hundred _cartons_ or pasteboard boxes of modern\r\noriginal documents, the _Dépôt_ possesses one hundred and thirty-one\r\nvolumes and seventy-eight _cartons_ of descriptive memoirs, composed\r\nat least of fifty memoirs each, four thousand seven hundred engraved\r\nmaps, of each of which there are from two to twenty-five copies,\r\nexclusively of those printed at the _Dépôt_, and upwards of seven\r\nthousand four hundred valuable manuscript maps, plans, or drawings of\r\nmarches, battles, sieges, &c.\r\n\r\nBy order of the government, it has furnished, in the course of the\r\nwar, seven thousand two hundred and seventy-eight engraved maps, two\r\nhundred and seven manuscript maps or plans, sixty-one atlases of\r\nvarious parts of the globe, and upwards of six hundred descriptive\r\nmemoirs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FRANÇOIS ANDREOSSY; who was the great great grandfather\r\nof the present French ambassador at our court.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On the 25th of April, 1792, was published a regulation,\r\ndecreed by the king, respecting the general direction of the _Dépôt\r\nde la guerre_. The annual expense of the establishment, at that time\r\namounted to 68,000 francs, but the geographical and historical\r\ndepartments were not filled. _Note of the Author._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: An _Agence des cartes_ was appointed, by the National\r\nAssembly, to class these materials, and arrange them in useful\r\norder.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: At the juncture alluded to (1793), the want of\r\ngeographical engineers having been felt as soon as the armies took\r\nthe field, three brigades were formed, each consisting of twelve\r\npersons. The composition of the _Dépôt de la guerre_, was increased\r\nin proportion to its importance: intelligent officers were placed\r\nthere; and no less than thirty-eight persons were employed in the\r\ninterior labour, that is, in drawing plans of campaigns, sieges, &c.\r\n_Note of the Author_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: That tempestuous period having dispersed the then\r\ndirector and his assistants, the _Dépôt de la guerre_ remained, for\r\nsome time, without officers capable of conducting it in a manner\r\nuseful to the country. In the mean while, wants were increasing, and\r\nmilitary operations daily becoming more important, when, in 1793,\r\nCARNOT, then a member of the Committee of Public Welfare, formed a\r\nprivate cabinet of topography, the elements of which he drew from the\r\n_Dépôt de la guerre_. This was a first impulse given to these\r\nvaluable collections. _Note of the Author_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Prince Charles is employed at Vienna in forming a\r\ncollection of books, maps, and military memoirs for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a _Dépôt_ for the instruction of the staff-officers of\r\nthe Austrian army. Spain has also begun to organize a system of\r\nmilitary topography in imitation of that of France. Portugal follows\r\nthe example. What are we doing in England?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 3, 1801_.\r\n\r\nIn this season, when the blasts of November have entirely stripped\r\nthe trees of their few remaining leaves, and Winter has assumed his\r\nhoary reign, the garden of the _Tuileries_, loses much of the gaiety\r\nof its attractions. Besides, to frequent that walk, at present, is\r\nlike visiting daily one of our theatres, you meet the same faces so\r\noften, that the scene soon becomes monotonous. As well for the sake\r\nof variety as exercise, I therefore now and then direct my steps\r\nalong the\r\n\r\nBOULEVARDS.\r\n\r\nThis is the name given to the promenades with which Paris is, in\r\npart, surrounded for an extent of six thousand and eighty-four\r\ntoises.\r\n\r\nThey are distinguished by the names of the _Old_ and the _New_. The\r\n_Old_, or _North Boulevards_, commonly called the _Grands\r\nBoulevards_, were begun in 1536, and, when faced with ditches, which\r\nwere to have been dug, they were intended to serve as fortifications\r\nagainst the English who were ravaging Picardy, and threatening the\r\ncapital. Thence, probably, the etymology of their name; _Boulevard_\r\nsignifying, as every one knows, a bulwark.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the extent of these _Old_ Boulevards is two\r\nthousand four hundred toises from the _Rue de la Concorde_ to the\r\n_Place de la Liberté_, formerly the site of the Bastille. They were\r\nfirst planted in 1660, and are formed into three alleys by four rows\r\nof trees: the middle alley is appropriated to carriages and persons\r\non horseback, and the two lateral ones are for foot-passengers.\r\n\r\nHere, on each side, is assembled every thing that ingenuity can\r\nimagine for the diversion of the idle stroller, or the recreation of\r\nthe man of business. Places of public entertainment, ambulating\r\nmusicians, exhibitions of different kinds, temples consecrated to\r\nlove or pleasure, Vauxhalls, ball-rooms, magnificent hotels, and\r\nother tasteful buildings, &c. Even the coffee-houses and taverns here\r\nhave their shady bowers, and an agreeable orchestra. Thus, you may\r\nalways dine in Paris with a band of music to entertain you, without\r\nadditional expense.\r\n\r\nThe _New_ Boulevards, situated to the south, were finished in 1761.\r\nThey are three thousand six hundred and eighty-three toises in extent\r\nfrom the _Observatoire_ to the _Hôtel des Invalides_. Although laid\r\nout much in the same manner as the _Old_, there is little resemblance\r\nbetween them; each having a very distinct appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the _New Boulevards_, the alleys are both longer and wider, and\r\nthe trees are likewise of better growth. There, the prospect is\r\nrural; and the air pure; while cultivated fields, with growing corn,\r\npresent themselves to the eye. Towards the town, however, stand\r\nseveral pretty houses; little theatres even were built, but did not\r\nsucceed. This was not their latitude. But some skittle-grounds and\r\ntea-gardens, lately opened, and provided with swings, &c. have\r\nattracted much company of a certain class in the summer.\r\n\r\nIn this quarter, you seldom meet with a carriage, scarcely ever with\r\npersons sprucely dressed, but frequently with honest citizens,\r\naccompanied by their whole family, as plain in their garb as in their\r\nmanners. Lovers too with their mistresses, who seek solitude, visit\r\nthis retired walk; and now and then a poor poet comes hither, not to\r\nsharpen his appetite, but to arrange his numbers.\r\n\r\nBefore, the revolution, the _Old_ Boulevards, from the _Porte St.\r\nMartin_ to the _Théâtre Favart_, was the rendezvous of the\r\n_élegantes_, who, on Sundays and Thursdays, used to parade there\r\nslowly, backward and forward, in their carriages, as our belles do in\r\nHyde Park; with this difference, that, if their admirers did not\r\naccompany them, they generally followed them to interchange\r\nsignificant glances, or indulge in amorous parley. I understand that\r\nthe summer lounge of the modern _élegantes_ has, of late years, been\r\nfrom the corner of the _Rue Grange Batelière_ to that of the _Rue\r\nMont-Blanc_, where the ladies took their seats. This attracting the\r\n_muscadins_ in great numbers, not long since obtained for that part\r\nof the Boulevard the appellation of _Petit Coblentz_.\r\n\r\nNearly about the middle of the North Boulevard stand two edifices,\r\nwhich owe their erection to the vanity of Lewis XIV. In the\r\ngratification of that passion did the _Grand Monarque_ console\r\nhimself for his numerous defeats and disappointments; and the age in\r\nwhich he lived being fertile in great men, owing, undoubtedly, to the\r\nencouragement he afforded them, his display of it was well seconded\r\nby their superior talents. Previously to his reign, Paris had several\r\ngates, but some of these being taken down, arcs of triumph, in\r\nimitation of those of the Romans, were erected in their stead by\r\n_Louis le Grand_, in commemoration of his exploits. And this too, at\r\na time when the allies might, in good earnest, have marched to Paris,\r\nhad they not, by delay, given Marshal Villars an opportunity of\r\nturning the tide of their victories on the plain of Denain. Such was\r\nthe origin of the\r\n\r\nPORTE SAINT DENIS.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of its architecture classes it among the first\r\npublic monuments in Paris. It consists of a triumphal arch, insulated\r\nin the manner of those of the ancients: it is seventy-two feet in\r\ndiameter as well as in elevation, and was executed in 1672, by BULLET\r\nfrom the designs of BLONDEL.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the principal entrance rise two sculptured pyramids,\r\ncharged with trophies of arms, both towards the faubourg, and towards\r\nthe city. Underneath each of these pyramids is a small collateral\r\npassage for persons on foot. The arch is ornamented with two\r\nbas-reliefs: the one facing the city represents the passage of\r\nthe Rhine; and the other, the capture of Maestricht.\r\n\r\nOn the frieze on both sides LUDOVICO MAGNO was formerly to be read,\r\nin large characters of gilt bronze. This inscription is removed, and\r\nto it are substituted the word _Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité_.\r\n\r\nOn arriving from Calais, you enter Paris by the _Porte St. Denis_. It\r\nwas also by the _Porte St. Denis_ that kings and queens made their\r\npublic entry. On these occasions, the houses in all the streets\r\nthrough which they passed, were decorated with silk hangings and\r\ntapestry, as far as the cathedral of _Notre-Dame_. Scented waters\r\nperfumed  the air in the form of _jets d'eau_; while wine and milk\r\nflowed from the different public fountains.\r\n\r\nFroissard relates that, on the entrance of Isabeau de Bavière, there\r\nwas in the _Rue St. Denis_ a representation of a clouded heaven,\r\nthickly sown with stars, whence descended two angels who gently\r\nplaced on her head a very rich crown of gold, set with precious\r\nstones, at the same time singing verses in her praise.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that Charles VI, anxious for a sight of his\r\nintended bride, took a fancy to mix in the crowd, mounted on\r\nhorseback behind Savoisi, his favourite. Pushing forward in order to\r\napproach her, he received from the serjeants posted to keep off the\r\npopulace several sharp blows on the shoulders, which occasioned great\r\nmirth in the evening, when the circumstance was related before the\r\nqueen and her ladies.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the Boulevard towards the east, at a short distance\r\nfrom the _Porte St. Denis_, you arrive at the\r\n\r\nPORTE SAINT MARTIN.\r\n\r\nAlthough this triumphal arch cannot be compared to the preceding in\r\nmagnificence, it was nevertheless executed by the same artists,\r\nhaving been erected in 1674. It is pierced with three openings, the\r\ncentre one of which is eighteen feet wide, and the two others nine.\r\nThe whole structure, which is fifty-four feet both in height and\r\nbreadth, is rusticated, and in the spandles of the arch are four\r\nbas-reliefs; the two towards the city represent the capture of\r\nBesançon, and the rupture of the triple alliance; and those towards\r\nthe faubourg, the capture of Lomberg, and the defeat of the Germans\r\nunder the emblem of an eagle repulsed by the god of war. These\r\nbas-reliefs are crowned by an entablature of the Doric order,\r\nsurmounted by an attic. The _Porte St. Martin_ is the grand\r\nentrance into Paris from all parts of Flanders.\r\n\r\nAt the west extremity of this _North_ Boulevard, facing the _Rue de\r\nla Concorde_, stands an unfinished church, called _La Magdeleine_,\r\nwhose cemetery received not only the bodies of Lewis XVI, his\r\nconsort, and his sister, but of the greater part of the victims that\r\nperished by guillotine.\r\n\r\nIn the space comprised between _La Magdeleine_ and the _Vieille Rue\r\ndu Temple_, I speak within compass when I say that there are\r\nsometimes to be seen fifty ambulating conjurers of both sexes. They\r\nall vary the form of their art. Some have tables, surmounted by\r\nflags, bearing mysterious devices; some have wheels, with\r\ncompartments adapted to every age and profession--One has a robe\r\ncharged with hieroglyphics, and tells you your fortune through a long\r\ntube which conveys the sound to your ear; the other makes you choose\r\nin a parcel, a square piece of white paper, which becomes covered\r\nwith characters at the moment when it is thrown into a jug that\r\nappears empty. The secret of this is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe jug contains a little sulphuret of potash, and the words are\r\nwritten with acetite of lead. The action of the exterior air, on, the\r\nsulphuret of potash, disengages from it sulphurated hydrogen gas,\r\nwhich, acting on the oxyd of lead, brings to view the characters that\r\nbefore were invislble.\r\n\r\nHere, the philosophic Parisians stop before the movable stall of an\r\nastrologer, who has surmounted it with an owl, as an emblem of his\r\nmagic wisdom. Many of them take this animal for a curiosity imported\r\nfrom foreign countries; for they are seldom able to distinguish a bat\r\nfrom a swallow.\r\n\r\n\"Does that bird come from China, my dear?\" says a lusty dame to her\r\nelderly husband, a shopkeeper of the _Rue St. Denis_.--\"I don't know,\r\nmy love,\" replies the other.--\"What eyes it has got,\" continues she;\r\n\"it must see a great deal better than we.\" \"No;\" cries a countryman\r\nstanding by; \"though its eyes are so big, it can't, in broad day,\r\ntell a cow from a calf.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady continues her survey of the scientific repository; and the\r\nconjurer, with an air of importance, proposes to her to draw, for two\r\n_sous_, a motto from Merlin's wheel. \"Take one, my dear,\" says the\r\nhusband; \"I wish to know whether you love me.\" The wife blushes and\r\nhesitates; the husband insists; she refuses, and is desirous of\r\ncontinuing her walk, saying that it is all foolishness.--\"What if it\r\nis?\" rejoins the husband, \"I've paid, so take a motto to please me.\"\r\nFor this once, the lady is quite at a nonplus; she at last consents,\r\nand, with a trembling hand, draws a card from the magic wheel: the\r\nhusband unrolls it with eagerness and confidence, and reads these\r\nwords: \"_My young lover is and will be constant_.\"--\"What the devil\r\ndoes this mean?\" exclaims the old husband; quite disconcerted.\r\n--\"'Tis a mistake,\" says the conjurer; \"the lady put her hand into\r\nthe wrong box; she drew the motto from the wheel for _young girls_,\r\ninstead of that for _married women_. Let _Madame_ draw again, she\r\nshall pay nothing more.\"--\"No, Mr. Conjurer,\" replies the shopkeeper,\r\n\"that's enough. I've no faith in such nonsense; but another time,\r\nmadam, take care that you don't put your hand into the wrong box.\"\r\nThe fat lady, with her face as red as fire, follows her husband, who\r\nwalks off grumbling, and it is easy to see, by their gestures, that\r\nthe fatal motto has sown discord in the family, and confirmed the\r\nshopkeeper's suspicions.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these divers into futurity, the corners of streets\r\nand walls of public squares, are covered with hand-bills announcing\r\nbooks containing secrets, sympathetic calculations of numbers in the\r\nlottery, the explanation of dreams in regard to those numbers,\r\ntogether with the different manners of telling fortunes, and\r\ninterpreting prognostics.\r\n\r\nAt all times, the marvellous has prevailed over simple truth, and the\r\nCumæan Sibyl attracted the inquisitive in greater crowds than\r\nSocrates, Plato, or any philosopher, had pupils in the whole course\r\nof their existence.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, the sciences are really making a rapid progress,\r\nnotwithstanding the fooleries of the pseudo-philosophers, who parade\r\nthe streets, and here, on the _Boulevards_, as well as in other parts\r\nof the town, exhibit lessons of physics.\r\n\r\nOne has an electrifying machine, and phials filled with phosphorus:\r\nfor two _sous_, he gives you a slight shock, and makes you a present\r\nof a small phial.\r\n\r\nFarther on, you meet with a _camera obscura_, whose effect surprises\r\nthe spectators the more, as the objects represented within it have\r\nthe motion which they do not find in common optics.\r\n\r\nThere, you see a double refracting telescope: for two _sous_, you\r\nenjoy its effect. At either end, you place any object whatever, and\r\nthough a hat, a board, or a child be introduced between the two\r\nglasses, the object placed appears not, on that account, the less\r\nclear and distinct to the eye of the person looking through the\r\nopposite glass. _Pierre_ has seen, and cannot believe his eyes:\r\n_Jacques_ wishes to see, and, on seeing, is in ecstacy: next comes\r\n_Fanchon_, who remains stupified. Enthusiasm becomes general, and the\r\nwitnesses of their delirium are ready to go mad at not having two\r\n_sous_ in their pocket.\r\n\r\nAnother fellow, in short, has a microscope, of which he extols the\r\nbeauty, and, above all, the effects: he will not describe the causes\r\nwhich produce them, because he is unacquainted with them; but,\r\nprovided he adapts his lessons to the understanding of those who\r\nlisten to him, this is all he wants. Sometimes he may be heard to say\r\nto the people about him: \"Gentlemen, give me a creeping insect, and\r\nfor one _sou_, I will shew it to you as big as my fist.\" Sometimes\r\ntoo, unfortunately for him, the insect which he requires is more\r\neasily found among part of his auditors, than the money.\r\n\r\nP.S. For the preceding account of the Parisian conjurers I am\r\nindebted to M. Pujoulx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 4, 1802_.\r\n\r\nIn one of your former letters you questioned me on a subject, which,\r\nthough it had not escaped my notice, I was desirous to avoid, till I\r\nshould be able to obtain on it some precise information. This I have\r\ndone; and I hasten to present you with the following sketch, which\r\nwill afford you a tolerably-correct idea of the\r\n\r\nFRENCH FUNDS, AND NATIONAL DEBT.\r\n\r\nThe booked or consolidated debt is called\r\n\r\nTIERS CONSOLIDÉ,\r\n\r\nfrom its being the consolidated third of the national debt, of which\r\nthe remaining two-thirds were reimbursed in _Bons de deux Tiers_ in\r\n1797 and 98. It bears interest at five per Cent. payable half yearly\r\nat the _Banque de France_. The payment of the interest is at present\r\nsix months in arrear. But the intention of the government is, by\r\npaying off in specie the interest of one whole year, to pay in future\r\nas soon as due.\r\n\r\nThe days of payment are the 1st of Germinal (23d of March) and the\r\n1st of Vendémiaire (23d of September).\r\n\r\nThis stock purchased at the present price of from 55 to 60 would\r\nproduce from eight to nine per cent. The general opinion is, that it\r\nwill rise to 80; and as it is the chief stock, and the standard of\r\nthe national credit, it is the interest, and must be the constant\r\nobject of the government to keep up its price.\r\n\r\nThere is a _Caisse d'amortissement_ or Sinking Fund, for the special\r\npurpose of paying off this stock, the effect of which, though not\r\nexactly known, must shortly be very considerable. The _Tiers\r\nConsolidé_ is saleable and transferable at a moment's warning, and at\r\na trifling expense. It is not subject to taxation, nor open to\r\nattachments, either on the principal or interest.\r\n\r\nFor purchasing, no sort of formality is required; but for receiving\r\ninterest, or selling, it is necessary to produce a power of attorney.\r\nAn established rule is, that the seller always retains his right to\r\nhalf a year's interest at the succeeding stated period of payment, so\r\nthat he who purchases in the interval between March and September, is\r\nentitled to the interest commencing from the 23d of the latter month\r\nonly; and he who buys between September and March, receives not his\r\nfirst dividend till the 23d of the following September.\r\n\r\nTIERS PROVISOIRE.\r\n\r\nThis is the debt, yet unbooked, which is composed of the provisional\r\nclaims of the creditors of the emigrants, the contractors, and\r\nvarious other holders of claims on the government.\r\n\r\nThe _Tiers Provisoire_ is to be booked before the 1st of Vendémiaire,\r\nyear XII of the Republic (23d of September, 1803), and will from that\r\nday bear interest of five per cent; so that, setting aside the danger\r\nof any retrospect in the interval, and that of any other change, it\r\nis at the present price, of from 15 to 50, cheaper than the _Tiers\r\nConsolidé_ to which, in about eighteen months, it will, in every\r\nrespect, be assimilated.\r\n\r\nBONS DE DEUX TIERS,\r\n\r\nIs paper issued for the purpose of reimbursing the reduced two-thirds\r\nof the National Debt, and in the origin rendered applicable to the\r\npurchase of national houses and estates in the French Colonies, since\r\nordered to be funded at five per cent; so that the price of this\r\nspecies of paper is entirely subordinate to that of the _Tiers\r\nConsolidé_ and supposing that to be 60 francs per cent, the _Bon de\r\ndeux Tiers_ would be worth 3 francs. There are no hopes, however\r\ndistant, that the government will ever restore the _Bons de deux\r\nTiers_ to their original value.\r\n\r\nBONS DE TROIS QUARTS,\r\n\r\nSo called from having been issued for the purpose of reimbursing the\r\nthree-fourths of the interest of the fifth and sixth years of the\r\nRepublic (1797 to 1798). They are, in all respects, assimilated to\r\nthe preceding stock.\r\n\r\nCOUPONS D'EMPRUNT FORCÉ.\r\n\r\nThese are the receipts given by the government to the persons who\r\ncontributed to the various forced loans. This paper is likewise\r\nassimilated to the two last-mentioned species, with this difference,\r\nthat it is generally considered as a less sacred claim, and is\r\ntherefore liquidated with greater difficulty. The holders of these\r\nthree claims are hastening the liquidation and consolidation of them,\r\nand they are evidently right in so doing.\r\n\r\nQUARTS AU NOM ET QUART NUMÉRAIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper is thus denominated from its having been issued for the\r\npurpose of reimbursing the fourth of the dividend of the fifth and\r\nsixth years of the Republic (1797 to 1798). It is generally thought\r\nthat this very sacred claim on the government will be funded _in\r\ntoto_.\r\n\r\nRACHATS DE RENTE,\r\n\r\nIs the name given to the redemption of perpetual annuities due by\r\nindividuals to the government, on a privileged mortgage on landed\r\nestates; the said annuities having been issued by the government in\r\ntimes of great distress, for the purpose of supplying immediate and\r\nurgent events.\r\n\r\nThis paper is not only a mere government security, but is also\r\nspecially mortgaged on the estates of the person who owes the annuity\r\nto the government, and who is, at any time, at liberty to redeem it\r\nat from twenty to twenty-five years purchase. Claims of this\r\ndescription, mortgaged on most desirable estates near the metropolis,\r\nmight be obtained for less than 60 per cent; which, at the interest\r\nof five per cent, and with the additional advantage, in some\r\ninstances, of the arrears of one or two years, would produce between\r\neight and nine per cent.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Tiers Consolidé_, _Rachats de Rente_ are particularly\r\nworthy of attention; indeed, this debt is of so secure and sacred a\r\nnature, that the government has appropriated a considerable part of\r\nit to the special purpose and service of the hospitals and schools;\r\ntwo species of institutions which ought ever to be sheltered from all\r\nvicissitudes, and which, whatever may be the form or character of the\r\ngovernment, must be supported and respected.\r\n\r\nACTIONS DE LA BANQUE DE FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThese are shares in the National Bank of France, which are limited to\r\nthe number of thirty thousand, and were originally worth one thousand\r\nfrancs each; they therefore form a capital of 30,000,000 francs, or\r\n£1,250,000 sterling, and afford as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A dividend which at present, and since the foundation, has\r\naveraged from eight to ten per cent, arising from the profits on\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\n2. A profit of from four to five per cent more on the discount of\r\npaper, which every holder of an _action_ or share effects at the\r\nBank, at the rate of one-half per cent per month, or six per cent for\r\nthe whole year.\r\n\r\nThe present price of an _action_ is about twelve hundred francs,\r\nwhich may be considered as producing:\r\n\r\n80 francs; dividend paid by the Bank on each share.\r\n\r\n30 francs; certain profits according to the present discount of\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n110 francs; per share 10-10/11 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Actions de la Banque de France_, though subject, in common with all\r\nstocks, to the influence of the government, are, however, far more\r\nindependent of it than any other, and are the more secure, as the\r\nNational Bank is not only composed of all the first bankers, but also\r\nsupported by the principal merchants in the country. This investment\r\nis at present very beneficial, and certainly promises great eventual\r\nadvantages. The dividends are paid in two half-yearly instalments.\r\n\r\nACTIONS DE LA CAISSE DE COMMERCE,\r\nET\r\nACTIONS DU COMPTOIR COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\nThe _Caisse de Commerce_ and the _Comptoir Commercial_ are two\r\nestablishments on the same plan, and affording, as nearly as\r\npossible, the same advantages as the _Banque de France_: the\r\nonly difference is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. These last two are, as far as any commercial establishment can be,\r\nindependent of the government, and are more so than the _Banque de\r\nFrance_, as the _actions_ or shares are not considered as being a\r\npublic fund.\r\n\r\n2. The _Actions de la Caisse de Commerce_ limited in number to two\r\nthousand four hundred, originally cost 5000 francs, and are now worth\r\n6000. The holder of each _action_ moreover, signs circulating notes\r\nto the amount of five thousand francs, which form the paper currency\r\nof the Bank, and for the payment of which the said holder would be\r\nresponsible, were the Bank to stop payment.\r\n\r\n3. The _Actions du Comptoir Commercial_ are still issued by the\r\nadministrators of the establishment. The number of _actions_ is not\r\nas yet limited: the price of each _action_ is fifteen hundred francs\r\n(_circa_ £60 sterling), and the plan and advantages are almost\r\nentirely similar to those of the two last-mentioned institutions.\r\n\r\nThe _Banque de France_ the _Caisse de Commerce_, and the _Comptoir\r\nCommercial_, discount three times a week. The first, the paper of the\r\nbanking-houses and the principal commercial houses holding\r\nbank-stock; the second, the paper of the wholesale merchants of every\r\nclass; and the third, the paper of retailers of all descriptions; and\r\nin a circulation which amounts to 100 millions of francs (_circa_ 4\r\nmillions sterling) per month, there have not, it is said, been seen,\r\nin the course of the last month, protests to the amount of 20,000\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nBONS DE L'AN VII ET DE L'AN VIII.\r\n\r\nIs a denomination applied to paper, issued for the purpose of paying\r\nthe dividend of the debt during the seventh and eighth years of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThese _Bons_ are no further deserving of notice than as they still\r\nform a part of the floating debt, and are an article of the supposed\r\nliquidation at the conclusion of the present summary. It is therefore\r\nunnecessary to say more of them.\r\n\r\nARRÉRAGES DES ANNÉES V ET VI.\r\n\r\nThese are the arrears due to such holders of stock as, during the\r\nfifth and sixth years of the Republic, had not their dividend paid in\r\n_Bons de trois Quarts_ and _Quart Numéraire_, mentioned in Art. IV\r\nand VI of this sketch. I also notice them as forming an essential\r\npart of the above-mentioned supposed liquidation, at the end of the\r\nsketch, and shall only add that it is the general opinion that they\r\nwill be funded.\r\n\r\nTo the preceding principal investments and claims on the government,\r\nmight be added the following:\r\n\r\n  _Coupes de Bois.\r\n  Cédules Hypothécaires.\r\n  Rescriptions de Domaines Nationaux.\r\n  Actions de la Caisse des Rentiers.\r\n  Actions des Indes.\r\n  Bons de Moines et Réligieuses.\r\n  Obligations de Reçeveur._\r\n\r\nHowever, they are almost entirely unworthy of attention, and afford\r\nbut occasionally openings for speculation. Of the last, (_Obligations\r\nde Reçeveur_) it may be necessary to observe that they are monthy\r\nacceptances issued by the Receivers-General of all the departments,\r\nwhich the government has given to the five bankers, charged with\r\nsupplying money for the current service, as security for their\r\nadvances, and which are commonly discounted at from 7/8 to one per\r\ncent per month.\r\n\r\nI shall terminate this concise, though accurate sketch of the French\r\nfunds by a general statement of the National Debt, and by an account\r\nof an annuity supposed to be held by a foreigner before the\r\nrevolution, and which, to become _Tiers Consolidé_, must undergo the\r\nregular process of reduction and liquidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_National Debt_.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Francs._\r\n\r\n  Consolidated Stock (_Tiers Consolidé_)              38,750,000\r\n  Floating Debt, to be consolidated, about            23,000,000\r\n  Life Annuities                                      20,000,000\r\n  Ecclesiastical, Military, and other Pensions        19,000,000\r\n                                                     -----------\r\n                                                     100,750,000\r\n\r\n  The value of a _franc_ is something more\r\n  than 10_d_.

On these occasions,\r\nnone but officers in complete uniform are admitted into the palace of\r\nthe _Tuileries_, unless provided with tickets, which are distributed\r\nto a certain number at the discretion of the governor. General A----y\r\nsent me tickets by ten o'clock this morning, and about half after\r\neleven, I repaired to the palace.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the vestibule from the garden of the _Tuileries_, you\r\nascend the grand stair-case to the left, which conducts you to the\r\nguard-room above it in the centre pavilion. Hence you enter the\r\napartments of the Chief Consul.\r\n\r\nOn the days of the grand parade, the first room is destined for\r\nofficers as low as the rank of captain, and persons admitted with\r\ntickets; the second, for field-officers; the third, for generals; and\r\nthe fourth, for councellors of state, and the diplomatic corps. To\r\nthe east, the windows of these apartments command the court-yard\r\nwhere the troops are assembled; while to the west, they afford a fine\r\nview of the garden of the _Tuileries_ and the avenue leading to the\r\n_Barrière de Chaillot_. In the first-room, those windows which\r\noverlook the parade were occupied by persons standing five or six in\r\ndepth, some of whom, as I was informed, had been patient enough to\r\nretain their places for the space of two or three hours, and among\r\nthem were a few ladies. Here, a sort of lane was formed from door to\r\ndoor by some grenadiers of the consular guard. I found both sides of\r\nthis lane so much crowded, that I readily accepted the invitation of\r\na _chef de brigade_ of my acquaintance to accompany him into the\r\nsecond room; this, he observed, was no more than a privilege to which\r\nI was entitled. This room was also crowded; but it exhibited a most\r\nbrilliant _coup d'oeil_ from the great variety and richness of the\r\nuniforms of the field-officers here assembled, by which mine was\r\nentirely eclipsed. The lace or embroidery is not merely confined to\r\nthe coats, jackets, and pantaloons, but extends to the sword belts,\r\nand even to the boots, which are universally worn by the military.\r\nIndeed, all the foreign ambassadors admit that none of the levees of\r\nthe European courts can vie in splendour with those of the Chief\r\nConsul.\r\n\r\nMy first care on entering this room, was to place myself in a\r\nsituation which might afford me an uninterrupted view of BONAPARTE.\r\nAbout twenty-five minutes past twelve, his sortie was announced by a\r\n_huissier_. Immediately after, he came out of the inner apartment,\r\nattended by several officers of rank, and, traversing all the other\r\nrooms with a quick step, proceeded, uncovered, to the parade, the\r\norder of which I have described to you in a former letter. On the\r\npresent occasion, however, it lasted longer on account of the\r\ndistribution of arms of honour, which the First Consul presents with\r\nhis own hand to those heroes who have signalized themselves in\r\nfighting their country's battles.\r\n\r\nThis part of the ceremony, which was all that I saw of the parade\r\nyesterday, naturally revived in my mind the following question, so\r\noften agitated: \"Are the military successes of the French the\r\nconsequences of a new system of operations and new tactics, or merely\r\nthe effect of the blind courage of a mass of men, led on by chiefs\r\nwhose resolutions were decided by presence of mind alone and\r\ncircumstances?\"\r\n\r\nThe latter method of explaining their victories has been frequently\r\nadopted, and the French generals have been reproached with lavishing\r\nthe lives of thousands for the sake of gaining unimportant\r\nadvantages, or repairing inconsiderable faults.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, it should seem that a murderous obstinacy has\r\nobtained them successes to which prudence had not paved the way; but,\r\ncertainly, the French can boast, too, of memorable days when talent\r\nhad traced the road to courage, when vast plans combined with\r\njudgment, have been followed with perseverance, when resources have\r\nbeen found in those awful moments in which Victory, hovering over a\r\nfield of carnage, leaves the issue of the conflict doubtful, till a\r\nsudden thought, a ray of genius, inclines her in favour of the\r\ngeneral, thus inspired, and then art may be said to triumph over art,\r\nand valour over valour.\r\n\r\nAnd whence came most of these generals who have shewn this\r\ninspiration, if I may so term it? Some, as is well known, emerged\r\nfrom the schools of jurisprudence; some, from the studies of the\r\narts; and others, from the counting-houses of commerce, as well as\r\nfrom the lowest ranks of the army. Previously to the revolution it\r\nwas not admitted, in this country at least, that such sources could\r\nfurnish men fit to be one day the arbiters of battles and of the fate\r\nof empires. Till that period, all those Frenchmen who had\r\ndistinguished themselves in the field, had devoted themselves from\r\ntheir infancy to the profession of arms, were born near the throne of\r\nwhich they constituted the lustre, or in that cast who arrogated to\r\nthemselves the exclusive right of defending their country. The glory\r\nof the soldier was not considered; and a private must have been more\r\nthan a hero to be as much remarked as a second lieutenant.\r\n\r\nMen of reflection, seeing the old tactics fail against successful\r\nessays, against enthusiasm whose effects are incalculable, studied\r\nwhether new ideas did not direct some new means; for it would have\r\nbeen no less absurd to grant all to valour than to attribute all to\r\nart. But to return to the main subject of my letter.\r\n\r\nIn about three quarters of an hour, BONAPARTE came back from the\r\nparade, with the same suite as before, that is, preceded by his\r\naides-de-camp, and followed by the generals and field-officers of the\r\nconsular guard, the governor of the palace, the general commanding\r\nthe first military division, and him at the head of the garrison of\r\nParis. For my part, I scarcely saw any one but himself; BONAPARTE\r\nalone absorbed my whole attention.\r\n\r\nA circumstance occurred which gave me an opportunity of observing the\r\nChief Consul with critical minuteness. I had left the second room,\r\nand taken my station in front of the row of gazers, close to the\r\nfolding-doors which opened into the first room, in order to see him\r\nreceive petitions and memorials. There was no occasion for BONAPARTE\r\nto cast his eyes from side to side, like the _Grand Monarque_ coming\r\nfrom mass, by way of inviting petitioners to approach him. They\r\npresented themselves in such numbers that, after he put his hat under\r\nhis arm, both his hands were full in a moment. To enable him to\r\nreceive other petitions, he was under the necessity of delivering the\r\nfirst two handfuls to his aides-de-camp. I should like to learn what\r\nbecomes of all these papers, and whether he locks them up in a little\r\ndesk of which he alone has the key, as was the practice of Lewis XIV.\r\n\r\nWhen BONAPARTE approached the door of the second room, he was\r\neffectually impeded in his progress by a lady, dressed in white, who,\r\nthrowing herself at his feet, gracefully presented to him a memorial,\r\nwhich he received with much apparent courtesy; but still seemed, by\r\nhis manner, desirous to pass forward. However, the crowd was so\r\nconsiderable and so intent on viewing this scene, that the\r\ngrenadiers, posted near the spot where it took place, were obliged to\r\nuse some degree of violence before they could succeed in clearing a\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nOf all the portraits which you and I have seen of BONAPARTE in\r\nEngland, that painted by Masquerier, and exhibited in Piccadilly,\r\npresents the greatest resemblance. But for his side-face, you may,\r\nfor twelve _sous_, here procure a perfect likeness of it at almost\r\nevery stall in the street. In short, his features are such as may, in\r\nmy opinion, be easily copied by any artist of moderate abilities.\r\nHowever incompetent I may be to the task, I shall, as you desire it,\r\nattempt to _sketch_ his person; though I doubt not that any French\r\n_commis_, in the habit of describing people by words, might do it\r\ngreater justice.\r\n\r\nBONAPARTE is rather below the middle size, somewhat inclined to\r\nstoop, and thin in person; but, though of a slight make, he appears\r\nto be muscular, and capable of fatigue; his forehead is broad, and\r\nshaded by dark brown hair, which is cut short behind; his eyes, of\r\nthe same colour, are full, quick, and prominent; his nose is\r\naquiline; his chin, protuberant and pointed; his complexion, of a\r\nyellow hue; and his cheeks, hollow. His countenance, which is of a\r\nmelancholy cast, expresses much sagacity and reflection: his manner\r\nis grave and deliberate, but at the same time open. On the whole, his\r\naspect announces him to be of a temperate and phlegmatic disposition;\r\nbut warm and tenacious in the pursuit of his object, and impatient of\r\ncontradiction. Such, at least, is the judgment which I should form of\r\nBONAPARTE from his external appearance.\r\n\r\nWhile I was surveying this man of universal talent, my fancy was not\r\nidle. First, I beheld him, flushed with ardour, directing the assault\r\nof the _téte-de-pont_ at _Lodi_; next dictating a proclamation to the\r\nBeys at _Cairo_, and styling himself the friend of the faithful; then\r\ncombating the ebullition of his rage on being foiled in the storming\r\nof _Acre_ I afterwards imagined I saw him like another CROMWELL,\r\nexpelling the Council of Five Hundred at _St. Cloud_, and seizing on\r\nthe reins of government: when established in power, I viewed him,\r\nlike HANNIBAL, crossing the _Alps_, and forcing victory to yield to\r\nhim the hard-contested palm at _Marengo_; lastly, he appeared to my\r\nimagination in the act of giving the fraternal embrace to Caprara,\r\nthe Pope's legate, and at the same time holding out to the see of\r\nRome the re-establishment of catholicism in France.\r\n\r\nVoltaire says that \"no man ever was a hero in the eyes of his\r\n_valet-de-chambre_.\" I am curious to know whether the valet of the\r\nFirst Consul be an exception to this maxim. As to BONAPARTE'S public\r\ncharacter, numerous, indeed, are the constructions put on it by the\r\nvoice of rumour: some ascribe to him one great man of antiquity as a\r\nmodel; some, another; but many compare him, in certain respects, to\r\nJULIUS CÆSAR, as imitators generally succeed better in copying the\r\nfailings than the good qualities of their archetypes, let us hope,\r\nsupposing this comparison to be a just one, that the Chief Consul\r\nwill, in one particular, never lose sight of the generous clemency of\r\nthat illustrious Roman--who, if any spoke bitterly against him,\r\ndeemed it sufficient to complain of the circumstance publicly, in\r\norder to prevent them from persevering in the use of such language.\r\n\"_Acerbè loquentibus satis habuit pro concione denunciare, ne\r\nperseverarent._\"\r\n\r\n\"The character of a great man,\" says a French political writer, who\r\ndenies the justness of this comparison, \"like the celebrated picture\r\nof Zeuxis, can be formed only of a multitude of imitations, and it is\r\nas little possible for the observer to find for him a single model in\r\nhistory, as it was for the painter of Heraclea to discover in nature\r\nthat of the ideal beauty he was desirous of representing[1].\"--\"The\r\nFrench revolution,\" observes the same author, a little farther on,\r\n\"has, perhaps, produced more than one CÆSAR, or one CROMWELL; but\r\nthey have disappeared before they have had it in their power to give\r\nfull scope to their ambition[2].\" Time will decide on the truth and\r\nimpartiality of these observations of M. HAUTERIVE.\r\n\r\nAs at the last monthly parade, BONAPARTE was habited in the consular\r\ndress, that is, a coat of scarlet velvet, embroidered with gold: he\r\nwore jockey boots, carelessly drawn over white cotton pantaloons, and\r\nheld in his hand a cocked hat, with the national cockade only. I say\r\nonly, because all the generals wear hats trimmed with a splendid\r\nlace, and decorated with a large, branching, tricoloured feather.\r\n\r\nAfter the parade, the following, I understand, is the _étiquette_\r\nusually observed in the palace. The Chief Consul first gives audience\r\nto the general-officers, next to the field-officers, to those\r\nbelonging to the garrison, and to a few petitioners. He then returns\r\nto the fourth apartment, where the counsellors of state assemble.\r\nBeing arrived there, notice is sent to the diplomatic corps, who meet\r\nin a room on the ground-floor of the palace, called _La Salle des\r\nAmbassadeurs_. They immediately repair to the levee-room, and, after\r\npaying their personal respects to the First Consul, they each\r\nintroduce to him such persons, belonging to their respective nations,\r\nas they may think proper. Several were this day presented by the\r\nImperial, Russian, and Danish ambassadors: the British minister, Mr.\r\nJackson, has not yet presented any of his countrymen nor will he, in\r\nall probability, as he is merely a _locum tenens_. After the levee,\r\nthe Chief Consul generally gives a dinner of from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred covers, to which all those who have received\r\narms of honour, are invited.\r\n\r\nBefore I left the palace, I observed the lady above-mentioned, who\r\nhad presented the memorial, seated in one corner of the room, all in\r\ntears, and betraying every mark of anxious grief: she was pale, and\r\nwith her hair dishevelled; but, though by no means handsome, her\r\ndistressed situation excited a lively interest in her favour. On\r\ninquiry, I was informed that it was Madame Bourmont, the wife of a\r\nVendean chief, condemned to perpetual imprisonment for a breach of\r\nthe convention into which he had jointly entered with the agents of\r\nthe French government.\r\n\r\nHaving now accomplished my object, when the crowd was somewhat\r\ndispersed, I retired to enjoy the fine weather by a walk in the\r\n\r\nCHAMPS ELYSÉES.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the garden of the _Tuileries_ and the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_, from east to west, you arrive at this fashionable summer\r\npromenade. It is planted with trees in quincunx; and although, in\r\nparticular points of view, this gives it a symmetrical air; yet, in\r\nothers, the hand of art is sufficiently concealed to deceive the eye\r\nby a representation of the irregular beauties of nature. The French,\r\nin general, admire the plan of the garden of the _Tuileries_, and\r\nthink the distribution tasteful; but, when the trees are in leaf, all\r\nprefer the _Champs Elysées_, as being more rural and more inviting.\r\nThis spot, which is very extensive, as you may see by the Plan of\r\nParis, has frequently been chosen for the scene of national fêtes,\r\nfor which it is, in many respects, better calculated than the _Champ\r\nde Mars_. However, from its proximity to the great road, the foliage\r\nis imbrowned by the dust, and an idea of aridity intrudes itself on\r\nthe imagination from the total absence of water. The sight of that\r\nrefreshing element recreates the mind, and communicates a powerful\r\nattraction even to a wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at this season of the year, the _Champs Elysées_ resemble a\r\ndesert; but, in summer, they present one of the most agreeable scenes\r\nthat can be imagined. In temporary buildings, of a tasteful\r\nconstruction, you then find here _restaurateurs_, &c, where all sorts\r\nof refreshments may be procured, and rooms where \"the merry dance\" is\r\nkept up with no common spirit. Swings and roundabouts are also\r\nerected, as well as different machines for exercising the address of\r\nthose who are fond of running at a ring, and other sports. Between\r\nthe road leading to _l'Étoile_, the _Bois de Boulogne_, &c, and that\r\nwhich skirts the Seine, formerly called the _Cours de la Reine_, is a\r\nlarge piece of turf, where, in fine weather, and especially on\r\nSundays, the Parisian youths amuse themselves at foot-ball,\r\nprison-bars, and long tennis. Here, too, boys and girls assemble,\r\nand improve their growth and vigour by dancing, and a variety of\r\nhealthful diversions; while their relations and friends, seated on\r\nthe grass, enjoy this interesting sight, and form around each group a\r\ncircle which is presently increased by numbers of admiring\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nUnder the shade of the trees, on the right hand, as you face the\r\nwest, an immense concourse of both sexes and all ages is at the same\r\ntime collected. Those who prefer sitting to walking occupy three long\r\nrows of chairs, set out for hire, three deep on each side, and\r\nforming a lane through which the great body of walkers parade. This\r\npromenade may then be said to deserve the appellation of _Elysian\r\nFields_, from the number of handsome women who resort hither. The\r\nvariety of their dresses and figures, the satisfaction which they\r\nexpress in seeing and being seen, their anxious desire to please,\r\nwhich constitutes their happiness and that of our sex, the triumph\r\nwhich animates the countenance of those who eclipse their rivals; all\r\nthis forms a diversified and amusing picture, which fixes attention,\r\nand gives birth to a thousand ideas respecting the art and coquetry\r\nof women, as well as what beauty loses or gains by adopting the\r\never-varying caprices of fashion. Here, on a fine summer's evening,\r\nare now to be seen, I am told, females displaying almost as much\r\nluxury of dress as used to be exhibited in the days of the monarchy.\r\nThe essential difference is that the road in the centre is not now,\r\nas in those times, covered with brilliant equipages; though every day\r\nseems to produce an augmentation of the number of private carriages.\r\nAt the entrance of the _Champs Elysées_ are placed the famous groups\r\nof Numidian horses, held in by their vigorous and masterly conductors,\r\ntwo _chefs d'oeuvre_ of modern art, copied from the group of\r\n_Monte-Cavallo_ at Rome. By order of the Directory, these statues were\r\nbrought from _Marly_, where they ornamented the terrace. They are\r\neach of them cut out of a block of the most faultless Carrara marble.\r\nOn the pedestal on which they stood at that once-royal residence, was\r\nengraved the name of COSTOU, 1745, without any Christian name: but,\r\nas there were two brothers of that name, Nicolas and Guillaume,\r\nnatives of Lyons, and both excellent sculptors, it is become a matter\r\nof doubt by which of them these master-pieces were executed; though\r\nthe one died in 1733, and the other in 1746. It is conjectured,\r\nhowever, that fraternal friendship induced them to share the fame\r\narising from these capital productions, and that they worked at them\r\nin common till death left the survivor the task of finishing their\r\njoint labour.\r\n\r\nTo whichever of the two the merit of the execution may be due, it is\r\ncertain that the fiery, ungovernable spirit of the horses, as well as\r\nthe exertion of vigour, and the triumph of strength in their\r\nconductors, is very happily expressed. The subject has frequently\r\nafforded a comparison to politicians. \"These statues,\" say some\r\nobservers, \"appear to be the emblem of the French people, over whom\r\nit is necessary to keep a tight hand.\"--\"It is to be apprehended,\"\r\nadd others, \"that the reins, which the conductors hold with so\r\npowerful an arm, are too weak to check these ungovernable animals.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _De l'Etat de la France, à la fin de l'an VIII._ page\r\n270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid. page 274.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dccemler 8, 1801_.\r\n\r\nYou desire that I will favour you with a particular account of the\r\nmeans employed to transfer from pannel to canvas those celebrated\r\npictures which I mentioned in my letter of the 13th ult°. Like many\r\nother, things that appear simple on being known, so is this process;\r\nbut it is not, on that account, the less ingenious and difficult in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nSuch is the great disadvantage of the art of painting that, while\r\nother productions of genius may survive the revolution of ages, the\r\ncreations of the pencil are intrusted to perishable wood or canvas.\r\nFrom the effect of heat, humidity, various exhalations to which they\r\nmay be carelessly exposed, and even an unperceived neglect in the\r\npriming of the pannel or cloth, master-pieces are in danger of\r\ndisappearing for ever. Happy, then, is it for the arts that this\r\ninvaluable discovery has been lately brought to so great a degree of\r\nperfection, and that the restoration of several capital pictures\r\nhaving been confided to men no less skilful than enlightened, they\r\nhave thus succeeded in rescuing them from approaching and inevitable\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nOf all the fruits of the French conquests, not a painting was brought\r\nfrom Lombardy, Rome, Florence, or Venice, that was not covered with\r\nan accumulation of filth, occasioned by the smoke of the wax-tapers\r\nand incense used in the ceremonies of the catholic religion. It was\r\ntherefore necessary to clean and repair them; for to bring them to\r\nFrance, without rendering them fit to be exhibited, would have\r\nanswered no better purpose than to have left them in Italy. One of\r\nthose which particularly fixed the attention of the Administration of\r\nthe CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, was the famous picture by RAPHAEL,\r\ntaken from the _Chiesa delle Contesse_ at Foligno, and thence\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of\r\n\r\nMADONNA DI FOLIGNO.\r\n\r\nThis _chef d'oeuvre_ was in such a lamentable state of decay, that\r\nthe French commissioners who selected it, wereunder the necessity of\r\npasting paper over it in order to prevent the scales, which curled up\r\non many parts of its surface, from falling off during its conveyance\r\nto to Paris. In short, had not the saving hand of art interposed,\r\nthis, and other monuments of the transcendent powers of the Italian\r\nschool, marked by the corroding tooth of Time, would soon have\r\nentirely perished.\r\n\r\nAs this picture could not be exhibited in its injured state, the\r\nAdministration of the Museum determined that it should be repaired.\r\nThey accordingly requested the Minister of the Interior to cause this\r\nimportant operation to be attended by Commissioners chosen from the\r\nNational Institute. The Class of Physical and Mathematical Sciences\r\nof that learned Society appointed to this task, GUYTON and\r\nBERTHOLLET, chymists, and the Class of Literature and Fine Arts named\r\nVINCENT and TAUNAY, painters.\r\n\r\nThese Commissioners, in concert with the Administration, having\r\nascertained the state of the picture, it was unanimously agreed that\r\nthe only mean of saving it would be to remove it from the worm-eaten\r\npannel on which it was painted. It was, besides, necessary to\r\nascertain the safety of the process, in order that, without, exciting\r\nthe apprehensions of the lovers of the arts, it might be applied to\r\nother pictures which required it.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the four Commissioners before named, respecting the\r\nrestoration of the _Madonna di Foligno_, has been adopted by the\r\nClasses to which they respectively belong, and is to be made to the\r\nNational Institute at their next public sitting on the 15th of Nivose\r\n(5th of January, 1802).\r\n\r\nIn order to make you perfectly acquainted with the whole of the\r\nprocess, I shall transcribe, for your satisfaction, that part of the\r\nReport immediately connected with the art of restoring damaged or\r\ndecayed paintings. This labour, and the success by which it was\r\nattended, are really a memorial of what the genius and industry of\r\nthe French can achieve. To all those who, like you, possess valuable\r\ncollections, such information cannot but be particularly interesting.\r\n\r\n\"The desire of repairing the outrages of time has unfortunately\r\naccelerated the decay of several pictures by coarse repainting and\r\nbad varnish, by which much of the original work has been covered.\r\nOther motives, too, have conspired against the purity of the most\r\nbeautiful compositions: a prelate has been seen to cause a discordant\r\nhead of hair to conceal the charms of a Magdalen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, efficacious means of restoration have been discovered:\r\na painting, the convass of which is decayed, or the pannel\r\nworm-eaten, is transferred to a fresh cloth; the profane touches\r\nof a foreign pencil are made to disappear; the effaced strokes are\r\nreinserted with scrupulous nicety; and life is restored to a picture\r\nwhich was disfigured, or drawing near to its end. This art has made\r\ngreat progress, especially in Paris, and experienced recent\r\nimprovement under the superintendance of the Administration of the\r\nMuseum; but it is only with a religious respect that any one can\r\nventure on an operation which may always give rise to a fear of some\r\nchange in the drawing or colouring, above all when the question is to\r\nrestore a picture by RAPHAEL.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The restoration may be divided into two parts; the one, which is\r\ncomposed of mechanical operations, whose object is to detach the\r\npainting from the ground on which it is fixed, in order to transfer\r\nit to a fresh one; the other, which consists in cleaning the surface\r\nof the painting from every thing that can tarnish it, in restoring\r\nthe true colour of the picture, and in repairing the parts destroyed,\r\nby tints skilfully blended with the primitive touches. Thence the\r\ndistinctive division of the mechanical operations, and of the art of\r\npainting, which will be the object of the two parts of this Report.\r\nThe former particularly engaged the attention of the Commissioners of\r\nthe _Class of Sciences_; and the latter, which required the habit of\r\nhandling a scientific pencil, fell to the share of the Commissioners\r\nof the _Class of Fine Arts_\"\r\n\r\nFIRST PART.\r\n\r\n\"Although the mechanical labour is subdivided into several\r\noperations, it was wholly intrusted to Citizen HACQUINS, on whose\r\nintelligence, address, and skill, it is our duty to bestow every\r\ncommendation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The picture represents the Virgin Mary, the infant Jesus, St. John,\r\nand several other figures of different sizes. It was painted on a\r\npannel of 1-1/2 inches in thickness: a crack extended from its\r\ncircumference to the left foot of the infant Jesus: it was 4-1/2\r\nlines wide at its upper part, and diminished progressively to the\r\nunder: from this crack to the right hand border, the surface formed a\r\ncurve whose greatest bend was 2 inches 5-1/2 lines, and from the\r\ncrack to the other border, another curve bending 2 inches. The\r\npicture was scaling off in several places, and a great number of\r\nscales had already detached themselves; the painting was, besides,\r\nworm-eaten in many parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was first necessary to render the surface even: to effect this, a\r\ngauze was pasted on the painting, and the picture was turned on its\r\nface. After that, Citizen HACQUINS made, in the thickness of the\r\nwood, several grooves at some distance from each other, and extending\r\nfrom the upper extremity of the bend to the place where the pannel\r\npresented a more level surface. Into these grooves he introduced\r\nlittle wooden wedges; he then covered the whole surface with wet\r\ncloths, which he took care to remoisten. The action of the wedges,\r\nwhich swelled by the moisture against the softened pannel, compelled\r\nthe latter to resume its primitive form: both edges of the crack\r\nbefore-mentioned being brought together, the artist had recourse to\r\nglue, in order to unite the two separated parts. During the\r\ndesiccation, he laid oak bars across the picture, for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the pannel in the form which he wished it to assume.\"\r\n\r\n\"The desiccation being effected slowly, the artist applied a second\r\ngauze on the first, then successively two thicknesses of grey\r\nblotting paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"This preparation (which the French artists call _cartonnage_) being\r\ndry, he laid the picture with its face downward on a table, to which\r\nhe carefully confined it; he next proceeded to the separation of the\r\nwood on which the painting was fixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first operation was executed by means of two saws, one of which\r\nacted perpendicularly; and the other, horizontally: the work of the\r\ntwo saws being terminated, the pannel was found to be reduced to the\r\nthickness of 4-1/2 lines. The artist then made use of a plane of a\r\nconvex form on its breadth: with this instrument he planed the pannel\r\nin an oblique direction, in order to take off very short shavings,\r\nand to avoid the grain of the wood: by these means he reduced the\r\npannel to 2/3 of a line in thickness. He then took a flat plane with\r\na toothed iron, whose effect is much like that of a rasp which\r\nreduces wood into dust: in this manner he contrived to leave the\r\npannel no thicker than a sheet of paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that state, the wood was successively moistened with clear water,\r\nin small compartments, which disposed it to detach itself: then the\r\nartist separated it with the rounded point of a knife-blade.\"\r\n\r\n\"The picture, thus deprived of all the wood, presented to the eye\r\nevery symptom of the injury which it had sustained. It had formerly\r\nbeen repaired; and, in order to fasten again the parts which\r\nthreatened to fall off, recourse had been had to oils and varnishes.\r\nBut those ingredients passing through the intervals left by such\r\nparts of the picture as were reduced to curling scales, had been\r\nextended in the impression to the paste, on which the painting\r\nrested, and had rendered the real restoration more difficult, without\r\nproducing the advantageous effect which had thence been expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same process would not serve for separating the parts of the\r\nimpression which had been indurated by varnishes, and those where the\r\npaste had remained unmixed: it was necessary to moisten the former\r\nfor some time in small compartments: when they were become\r\nsufficiently softened, the artist separated them with the blade of\r\nhis knife: the others were more easily separated by moistening them\r\nwith a flannel, and rubbing them slightly. It required all the\r\naddress and patience of Citizen HACQUINS to leave nothing foreign to\r\nthe work of the original painter: at length the outline of RAPHAEL\r\nwas wholly exposed to view, and left by itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"In order to restore a little suppleness to the painting, which was\r\ntoo much dried, it was rubbed all over with carded cotton imbibed\r\nwith oil, and wiped with old muslin: then white lead, ground with\r\noil, was substituted in the room of the impression made by paste, and\r\nfixed by means of a soft brush.\"\r\n\r\n\"After being left to dry for three months, a gauze was glued on the\r\nimpression made by oil; and on the latter, a fine canvas.\"\r\n\r\n\"When this canvas was dry, the picture was detached from the table,\r\nand turned, in order to remove the _cartonnage_ from it with water;\r\nthis operation being effected, the next proceeding was to get rid of\r\nthe appearance of the inequalities of the surface arising from the\r\ncurling up of its parts: for that purpose, the artist successively\r\napplied on the inequalities, flour-paste diluted. Then having put a\r\ngreasy paper on the moistened part, he laid a hot iron on the parts\r\ncurled up, which became level: but it was not till after he had\r\nemployed the most unequivocal signs to ascertan the suitable degree\r\nof heat, that he ventured to come near the painting with the iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been seen that the painting, disengaged from its impression\r\nmade by paste and from every foreign substance, had been fixed on an\r\nimpression made by oil, and that a level form had been given to the\r\nuneven parts of its surface. This master-piece was still to be\r\nsolidly applied on a new ground: for that, it was necessary to paste\r\npaper over it again, detach it from the temporary gauze which had\r\nbeen put on the impression, add a new coat of oxyde of lead and oil,\r\napply to it a gauze rendered very supple, and on the latter, in like\r\nmanner done over with a preparation of lead, a raw cloth, woven all\r\nin one piece, and impregnated, on its exterior surface, with a\r\nresinous substance, which was to confine it to a similar canvass\r\nfixed on the stretching-frame. This last operation required that the\r\nbody of the picture, disengaged from its _cartonnage_, or paper\r\nfacing, and furnished with a new ground, should be exactly applied to\r\nthe cloth done over with resinous substances, at the same time\r\navoiding every thing that might hurt it by a too strong or unequal\r\nextension, and yet compelling every part of its vast extent to adhere\r\nto the cloth strained on the stretching-frame. It is by all these\r\nproceedings that the picture has been incorporated with a ground more\r\ndurable than the original one, and guarded against the accidents\r\nwhich had produced the injuries. It was then subjected to\r\nrestoration, which is the object of the second part of this Report.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been obliged to confine ourselves to pointing out the\r\nsuccessive operations, the numerous details of which we have\r\nattended; we have endeavoured to give an idea of this interesting\r\nart, by which the productions of the pencil may be indefinitely\r\nperpetuated, in order only to state the grounds of the confidence\r\nthat it has appeared to us to merit.\"\r\n\r\nSECOND PART.\r\n\r\n\"After having given an account of the mechanical operations, employed\r\nwith so much success in the first part of the restoration of the\r\npicture by RAPHAEL, it remains for us to speak of the second, the\r\nrestoration of the painting, termed by the French artists\r\n_restauration pittoresque_. This part is no less interesting than the\r\nformer. We are indebted to it for the reparation of the ravages of\r\ntime and of the ignorance of men, who, from their unskilfulness, had\r\nstill added to the injury which this master-piece had already\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n\"This essential part of the restoration of works of painting,\r\nrequires, in those who are charged with it, a very delicate eye, in\r\norder to know how to accord the new tints with the old, a profound\r\nknowledge of the proceedings employed by masters, and a long\r\nexperience, in order to foresee, in the choice and use of colours,\r\nwhat changes time may effect in the new tints, and consequently\r\nprevent the discordance which would be the result of those changes.\r\n\r\n\"The art of restoring paintings likewise requires the most scrupulous\r\nnicety to cover no other than the damaged parts, and an extraordinary\r\naddress to match the work of the restoration with that of the master,\r\nand, as it were, replace the first priming in all its integrity,\r\nconcealing the work to such a degree that even unexperienced eye\r\ncannot distinguish what comes from the hand of the artist from what\r\nbelongs to that of the master.\r\n\r\n\"It is, above all, in a work of the importance of that of which we\r\nare speaking, that the friends of the arts have a right to require,\r\nin its restoration, all the care of prudence and the exertion of the\r\nfirst talents. We feel a real satisfaction in acquainting you with\r\nthe happy result of the discriminating wisdom of the Administration\r\nof the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS; who, after having directed and\r\nsuperintended the first part of the restoration, employed in the\r\nsecond, that of the painting (which we call _pittoresque_) Citizen\r\nROESER, whose abilities in this line were long known to them, and\r\nwhose repeated success had justified their confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having assured the Institute that they consider the\r\n_pittoresque_ part of the restoration of the _Madonna di Foligno_ as\r\npure as it was possible to be desired, the Commissioners proceed to\r\ncall their attention to some discordance in the original design and\r\ncolouring of this _chef d'oeuvre_, and to make on it some critical\r\nobservations. This they do in order to prevent any doubts which might\r\narise in the mind of observers, and lead them to imagine that the\r\nrestoration had, in any manner, impaired the work of RAPHAEL.\r\n\r\nThey next congratulate themselves on having at length seen this\r\nmasterpiece of the immortal RAPHAEL restored to life, shining in all\r\nits lustre, and through such means, that there ought no longer to\r\nremain any fear respecting the recurrence of those accidents whose\r\nravages threatened to snatch it for ever from general admiration.\r\n\r\nThey afterwards terminate their Report in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The Administration of the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, who have, by\r\ntheir knowledge, improved the art of restoration, will, no doubt,\r\nneglect nothing to preserve that art in all its integrity; and,\r\nnotwithstanding repeated success, they will not permit the\r\napplication of it but to pictures so injured, that there are more\r\nadvantages in subjecting them to a few risks inseparable from\r\ndelicate and numerous operations, than in abandoning them to the\r\ndestruction by which they are threatened. The invitation which the\r\nAdministration of the Museum gave to the National Institute to attend\r\nthe restoration of the _Madonna di Foligno_ by RAPHAEL, is to us a\r\nsure pledge that the enlightened men of whom it is composed felt that\r\nthey owed an account of their vigilance to all the connoisseurs in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It may not be amiss to observe that RAPHAEL employed the\r\n_impasto_ colour but in few of his pictures, of which the\r\n_Transfiguration_ is one wherein it is the most conspicuous: his\r\nother productions are painted with great transparency, the colours\r\nbeing laid on a white ground; which rendered still more difficult the\r\noperation above-mentioned. _Note of the Author_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 10, 1801._\r\n\r\n\"Of all the bridges that were ever built,\" says Sterne, \"the whole\r\nworld, who have passed over it, must own that the noblest--the\r\ngrandest--the lightest--the longest--the broadest that ever conjoined\r\nland and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe, is the\r\n\r\nPONT NEUF.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Pont Neuf_ is certainly the largest, and, on account of its\r\nsituation[1], the most conspicuous, and most frequented of any of the\r\nbridges in Paris; but, in the environs of the capital, is one which\r\nsurpasses them all. This is the _Pont de Neuilly._\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the _Pont Neuf_ was laid by Henry III in 1578, and\r\nthe foundation of the piles was begun to be formed on the opposite\r\nside; when the troubles of the League forced DU CERCEAU, the\r\narchitect, to withdraw to foreign countries. The work was not resumed\r\ntill the reign of Henry IV, who ordered it to be continued under the\r\ndirection of MARCHAND; but, owing to various causes, the _Pont Neuf_\r\nwas not finished till 1674.\r\n\r\nThe length of this bridge is one thousand and twenty feet, and its\r\nbreadth seventy-two; which is sufficient to admit of five carriages\r\npassing abreast. It is formed of twelve arches, seven of which are on\r\nthe side of the _Louvre_, and five on the side of the _Quai des\r\nAugustins_, extending over the two channels of the river, which is\r\nwider in this place, from their junction.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the parapets were repaired, and the foot-way lowered and\r\nnarrowed. SOUFFLOT, the architect of the Pantheon, availed himself of\r\nthis opportunity to build, on the twenty half-moons which stand\r\nimmediately above each pile, as many rotundas, in stone, to serve as\r\nshops. On the outside, above the arches, is a double cornice, which\r\nattracts the eye of the connoisseur in architecture, notwithstanding\r\nits mouldering state, on account of the _fleurons_ in the antique\r\nstyle, and the heads of Sylvans, Dryads, and Satyrs, which serve as\r\nsupports to it, at the distance of two feet from each other.\r\n\r\nAs the mole that forms a projection on this bridge between the fifth\r\nand seventh arch, stands facing the _Place Dauphine_, which was built\r\nby Henry IV, it was the spot chosen for erecting to him a statue.\r\nThis was the first public monument of the kind that had been raised\r\nin honour of French kings. Under the first, second, and third race,\r\ntill the reign of Lewis XIII, if the statue of a king was made, it\r\nwas only for the purpose, of being placed on his tomb, or else at the\r\nportal of some church, or royal residence which he had either built\r\nor repaired.\r\n\r\nParisians and strangers used to admire this equestrian statue of\r\nHenry IV, and before the revolution, all agreed in taking him for the\r\nmodel of goodness. In proof of his popularity, we are told, in the\r\n_Tableau de Paris_, that a beggar was one day following a passenger\r\nalong, the foot-way, of the _Pont Neuf_: it was a festival. \"In the\r\nname of St. Peter,\" said the mendicant, \"in the name of St. Joseph,\r\nin the name of the Virgin Mary, in the name of her divine Son, in the\r\nname of God?\" Being arrived before the statue of the conqueror of the\r\nLeague, \"In the name of _Henri quatre_\" exclaimed he, \"in the name of\r\n_Henri quatre?_\"--\"Here!\" said the passenger, and he gave him a louis\r\nd'or.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, no monarch that ever sat on the throne of France was\r\nso popular as _Henri quatre_; and his popularity was never eclipsed\r\nby any of his successors. Even amidst the rage of the revolutionary\r\nstorm, the military still held his memory in veneration. On opening\r\nthe sepultures at St. Denis in 1793, the coffin of Henry IV was the\r\nfirst that was taken out of the vault of the Bourbons. Though he died\r\nin 1610, his body was found in such preservation that the features of\r\nhis face were not altered. A soldier, who was present at the opening\r\nof the coffin, moved by a martial enthusiasm, threw himself on the\r\nbody of this warlike prince, and, after a considerable pause of\r\nadmiration, he drew his sabre, and cut off a long lock of Henry's\r\nbeard, which was still fresh, at the same time exclaiming, in very\r\nenergetic and truly-military terms: \"And I too am a French soldier!\r\nIn future I will have no other whiskers.\" Then placing this valuable\r\nlock on his upper lip, he withdrew, adding emphatically: \"Now I am\r\nsure to conquer the enemies of France, and I march to victory.\"\r\n\r\nIn Paris, all the statues of kings had fallen, while that of Henry IV\r\nstill remained erect. It was for some time a matter of doubt whether\r\nit should be pulled down. \"The poem of the _Henriade_ pleaded in its\r\nfavour;\" but, says Mercier, \"he was an ancestor of the perjured\r\nking,\" Then, and not till then, this venerated statue underwent the\r\nsame fate.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally believed that the deed of Ravaillac was\r\ndictated by fanaticism, or that he was the instrument employed by the\r\nMarchioness of Verneuil and the Duke of Epernon for assassinating\r\nthat monarch. However, it stands recorded, I am told, in a manuscript\r\nfound in the National Library, that Ravaillac killed Henry IV because\r\nhe had seduced his sister, and abandoned her when pregnant. Thus\r\ntime, that affords a clue to most mysteries, has also solved this\r\nhistorical enigma.\r\n\r\nThis statue of Henry IV was erected on the 23d of August, 1624. To\r\nhave insulted it, would, not long since, have been considered as a\r\nsacrilege; but, after having been mutilated and trodden under foot,\r\nthis once-revered image found its way to the mint or the\r\ncannon-foundry. On its site now stands an elegant coffeehouse,\r\nwhence you may enjoy a fine view of the stately buildings which\r\nadorn the quays that skirt the river.\r\n\r\nWhile admiring the magnificence of this _coup d'oeil_, an Englishman\r\ncannot avoid being struck by the multitude of washerwomen, striving\r\nto expel the dirt from linen, by means of _battoirs_, or wooden\r\nbattledores. On each side of the Seine are to be seen some hundreds\r\nhard at work, ranged in succession, along the sides of low barks,\r\nequal in length to our west-country barges. Such is the vigour of\r\ntheir arm that, for the circumference of half-a-mile, the air\r\nresounds with the noise of their incessant blows. After beating the\r\nlinen for some time in this merciless manner, they scrub it with a\r\nhard brush, in lieu of soaping it, so that a shirt which has passed\r\nthrough their hands five or six times is fit only for making lint. No\r\nwonder then that Frenchmen, in general, wear coarse linen: a hop-sack\r\ncould not long resist so severe a process. However, it must be\r\nconfessed, that some good arises from this evil. These washerwomen\r\ninsensibly contribute to the diffusion of knowledge; for, as they are\r\ncontinually reducing linen into rags, they cannot but considerably\r\nincrease the supply, of that article for the manufacture of paper.\r\n\r\nCompared to the Thames, even above bridge, the Seine is far from\r\nexhibiting a busy scene; a few rafts of wood for fuel, and some\r\nbarges occasionally in motion, now and then relieve the monotony of\r\nits rarely-ruffled surface. At this moment, its navigation is impeded\r\nfrom its stream being swollen by the late heavy rains. Hence much\r\nmischief is apprehended to the country lying contiguous to its banks.\r\nMany parts of Paris are overflowed: in some streets where carriages\r\nmust pass, horses are up to their belly in water; while pedestrians\r\nare under the necessity of availing themselves of the temporary\r\nbridges, formed with tressels and planks, by the industrious\r\nSavoyards. The ill consequences of this inundation are already felt,\r\nI assure you; being engaged to dinner yesterday in the _Rue St.\r\nFlorentin_, I was obliged to step into a punt in order to reach the\r\nbottom of the stair-case; and what was infinitely more mortifying to\r\nthe master of the house, was that, the cellar being rendered\r\ninaccessible,--he was deprived of the satisfaction of regaling his\r\nguests with his best claret.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the _Pont Neuf_, in crossing that bridge\r\nfrom the _Quai de l'École_ to the _Quai de Conti_, is a building,\r\nthree stories high, erected on piles, with its front standing between\r\nthe first and second arches. It is called\r\n\r\nLA SAMARITAINE.\r\n\r\nOver the dial is a gilt group, representing Jesus Christ and the\r\nSamaritan woman near Jacob's well, pourtrayed by a basin into which\r\nfalls a sheet of water issuing from a shell above. Under the basin is\r\nthe following inscription:\r\n\r\n          _Fons Hortorum\r\n  Puteus aquarum viventium._\r\n\r\nThese words of the Gospel are here not unaptly applied to the\r\ndestination of this building, which is to furnish water to the garden\r\nof the _Tuileries_, whose basins were not, on that account, the less\r\ndry half the year. The water is raised by means of a pump, and\r\nafterwards distributed, by several conduits, to the _Louvre_ and the\r\n_Palais du Tribunat_, as well as to the _Tuileries_.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, and above the arch, is a superstructure of timber-work\r\nfaced with gilt lead, where are the bells of the clock and those of\r\nchimes, which ought to play every half-hour.\r\n\r\nThis tasteless edifice interrupts the view in every direction and as\r\nit is far from being an ornament to the _Pont Neuf_, no one could now\r\nregret its entire removal. Under the old _régime_, however, it was\r\nnothing less than a government.\r\n\r\nAmong the functions of the governor, were included the care of the\r\nclock, which scarcely ever told the hour, and that of the chimes,\r\nwhich were generally out of order. When these chimes used to delight\r\nHenry IV, it is to be presumed that they were kept in better tune. It\r\nwas customary to make them play during all public ceremonies, and\r\nespecially when the king passed.\r\n\r\n\"The _Pont Neuf_, is in the city of Paris what the heart is in the\r\nhuman body, the centre of motion and circulation: the flux and reflux\r\nof inhabitants and strangers crowd this passage in such a manner,\r\nthat, in order to meet persons one is looking for, it is sufficient\r\nto walk here for an hour every day. Here, the _mouchards_, or spies\r\nof the police, take their station; and, when at the expiration of a\r\nfew days, they see not their man, they positively affirm that he is\r\nnot in Paris.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the animated picture of the _Pont Neuf_, as drawn by Mercier\r\nin 1788, and such it really was before the revolution. At present,\r\nthough this bridge is sometimes thronged with passengers, it presents\r\nnot, according to my observation, that almost continual crowd and\r\nbustle for which it was formerly distinguished. No stoppage now from\r\nthe press of carriages of any description, no difficulty in advancing\r\nquickly through the concourse of pedestrians. Fruit-women, hucksters,\r\nhawkers, pedlars, indeed, together with ambulating venders of\r\nlottery-tickets, and of _tisane_, crying \"_à la fraiche! Qui veut\r\nboire?_\" here take their stand as they used, though not in such\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nBut the most sensible diminution is among the shoe-blacks, who stand\r\nin the carriage-way, and, with all their implements before them,\r\nrange themselves along the edge of the very elevated _trottoir_ or\r\nfoot-pavement. The _décrotteurs_ of the _Pont Neuf_ were once reputed\r\nmasters of the art: their foresight was equal to their dexterity and\r\nexpedition. For the very moderate sum of two _liards_, they enabled\r\nan abbé or a poet to present himself in the gilded apartments of a\r\ndutchess. If it rained, or the rays of the sun were uncommonly\r\nardent, they put into his hand an umbrella to protect the economy of\r\nhis head-dress during the operation. Their great patrons have\r\ndisappeared, and, in lieu of a constant succession of customers, the\r\nfew _décrotteurs_ who remain at their old-established station, are\r\nidle half the day for want of employment.\r\n\r\nThese Savoyards generally practise more than one trade, as is\r\nindicated by the _enseigne_ which is affixed, on a short pole, above\r\ntheir tool-box.\r\n\r\n  LA FRANCE tond les\r\n  chiens coupe les chats\r\n  proprement et sa femme\r\n  vat en ville et en campagne\r\n\r\nChange the name only, and such is, line for line, letter for letter,\r\nthe most ordinary style of their _annonce_. It is, however, to be\r\npresumed, that the republican belles have adopted other favourites\r\ninstead of dogs and cats; for no longer is seen, as in the days of\r\nroyalty, the aspiring or favoured lover carrying his mistress's\r\nlap-dog in the public promenades. In fact, the business of\r\ndog-shearing, &c. seems full as dead in this part of Paris as that\r\nof shoe-cleaning. The _artists_ of the _Pont Neuf_ are, consequently,\r\nchop-fallen; and hilarity which formerly shone on their countenance,\r\nis now succeeded by gloomy sadness.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the _Pont Neuf_ on the _Quai de la Féraille_\r\nrecruiting-officers used to unfurl their inviting banners, and\r\nneglect nothing that art and cunning could devise to insnare the\r\nignorant, the idle, and the unwary. The means which they sometimes\r\nemployed were no less whimsical than various: the lover of wine was\r\ninvited to a public-house, where he might intoxicate himself; the\r\nglutton was tempted by the sight of ready-dressed turkies, fowls,\r\nsausages &c. suspended to a long pole; and the youth, inclined to\r\nlibertinism, was seduced by the meretricious allurements of a\r\nwell-tutored doxy. To second these manoeuvres, the recruiter\r\nfollowed the object of his prey with a bag of money, which he\r\nchinked occasionally, crying out \"_Qui en veut?_\" and, in this\r\nmanner, an army of heroes was completed. It is almost superfluous\r\nto add, that the necessity of such stratagems is obviated, by the\r\npresent mode of raising soldiers by conscription.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the _Pont Neuf_, I must relate to you an adventure\r\nwhich, in the year 1786, happened to our friend P-----, who is now\r\nabroad, in a situation of considerable trust and emolument. He was,\r\nat that time, a half-pay subaltern in the British army, and visited\r\nParis, as well from motives of economy as from a desire of acquiring\r\nthe French language. Being a tall, fresh-coloured young man, as he\r\nwas one day crossing the _Pont Neuf_, he caught the eye of a\r\nrecruiting-officer, who followed him from the _Quai de la Féraille_\r\nto a coffee-house, in the _Rue St. Honoré_, which our Englishman\r\nfrequented for the sake of reading the London newspapers. The\r\nrecruiter, with all the art of a crimp combined with all the\r\npoliteness of a courtier, made up to him under pretence of having\r\nrelations in England, and endeavoured, by every means in his power,\r\nto insinuate himself into the good graces of his new acquaintance.\r\nP----, by way of sport, encouraged the eagerness of the recruiter,\r\nwho lavished on him every sort of civility; peaches in brandy,\r\ntogether with the choicest refreshments that a Parisian coffee-house\r\ncould afford, were offered to him and accepted: but not the smallest\r\nhint was dropped of the motive of all this more than friendly\r\nattention. At length, the recruiter, thinking that he might venture\r\nto break the ice, depicted, in the most glowing colours, the\r\npleasures and advantages of a military life, and declared ingenuously\r\nthat nothing would make him so happy as to have our countryman P----\r\nfor his comrade. Without absolutely accepting or rejecting his offer,\r\nP---- begged a little delay in order to consider of the matter, at\r\nthe same time hinting that there was; at that moment, a small obstacle\r\nto his inclination. The recruiter, like a pioneer, promised to remove\r\nit, grasped his hand with joy and exultation, and departed, singing a\r\nsong of the same import as that of Serjeant Kite:\r\n\r\n  \"Come brave boys, 'tis one to ten,\r\n  But we return all gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few days, the recruiter again met Mr. P---- at his accustomed\r\nrendezvous; when, after treating him with coffee, liqueur, &c. he\r\ncame directly to the point, but neglected not to introduce into his\r\ndiscourse every persuasive allurement. P----, finding himself pushed\r\nhome, reminded the recruiter of the obstacle to which he had before\r\nalluded, and, to convince him of its existence, put into his hand His\r\nBritannic Majesty's commission. The astonishment and confusion of the\r\nFrench recruiter were so great that he was unable to make any reply;\r\nbut instantly retired, venting a tremendous ejaculation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By the Plan of Paris, it will be seen that the _Pont\r\nNeuf_ lies at the west point of the Island called _L'Ile du Palais_,\r\nand is, as it were, in the very centre of the capital.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 13, 1801._\r\n\r\nIn this gay capital, balls succeed to balls in an almost incredible\r\nvariety. There are actually an immense number every evening; so that\r\npersons fond of the amusement of dancing have full scope for the\r\nexercise of their talents in Paris. It is no longer a matter of\r\nsurprise to me that the French women dance so well, since I find that\r\nthey take frequent lessons from their master, and, almost every\r\nnight, they are at a dance of one kind or another. Added to this, the\r\nsame set of dances lasts the whole season, and go where you will, you\r\nhave a repetition of the same. However, this detracts not in the\r\nsmallest degree; from the merit of those Parisian belles who shine as\r\nfirst-rate dancers. The mechanical part of the business, as Mr.\r\nC----g would call it, they may thus, acquire by constant practice;\r\nbut the decorative part, if I may so term the fascinating grace which,\r\nthey display in all their movements, is that the result of study, or\r\ndo they hold it from the bounteous hand of Nature?\r\n\r\nWhile I am speaking of balls, I must inform you that, since the\r\nprivate ball of which I gave you so circumstantial an account, I have\r\nbeen at several others, also private, but of a different complexion;\r\ninasmuch as pleasure, not profit, was the motive for which they were\r\ngiven, and the company was more select; but, in point of general\r\narrangement, I found them so like the former, that I did not think it\r\nworth while to make any one of them the subject of a distinct letter.\r\nIn this line Madame Recamier takes the lead, but though her balls are\r\nmore splendid, those of Madame Soubiran are more agreeable. On the\r\n21st of Frimaire, which was yesterday, I was at a public ball of the\r\nmost brilliant kind now known in Paris. It was the first of the\r\nsubscription given this season, and, from the name of the apartment\r\nwhere it is held, it is styled the\r\n\r\nBAL DU SALON DES ÉTRANGERS.\r\n\r\nMidnight is the general hour for the commencement of such diversions;\r\nbut, owing to the long train of carriages setting down company at\r\nthis ball, it was near two o'clock before I could arrive at the scene\r\nof action, in the _Rue Grange Batelière_, near the Boulevards.\r\n\r\nAfter I alighted and presented my ticket, some time elapsed before I\r\ncould squeeze into the room where the dancing was going forward. The\r\nspectators were here so intermixed with the dancers, that they formed\r\naround them a border as complete as a frame to a picture. It is\r\nastonishing that, under such circumstances, a Parisian Terpsichore,\r\nfar from being embarrassed, lays fresh claim to your applause. With\r\nmathematical precision, she measures with her eye the space to which\r\nshe is restricted by the curiosity of the by-standers. Rapid as\r\nlightning, she springs forward till the measure recalling her to the\r\nplace she left, she traces her orbit, like a planet, at the same time\r\nrevolving on her axis. Sometimes her \"light, fantastic toe\" will\r\napproach within half an inch of your foot; nay, you shall almost feel\r\nher breath on your cheek, and still she will not touch you, except,\r\nperhaps, with the skirt of her floating tunic.\r\n\r\nAmong the female part of the company, I observed several lovely\r\nwomen; some, who might have been taken for Asiatic sultanas,\r\nirradiating the space around them by the dazzling brilliancy of their\r\nornaments; others, without jewels, but calling in every other aid of\r\ndress for the embellishment of their person; and a few, rich in their\r\nnative charms alone, verifying the expression of the poet. Truth\r\ncompels me to acknowledge that six or eight English ladies here were\r\ntotally eclipsed. For the honour of my country, I could have wished\r\nfor a better specimen of our excellence in female beauty. No women in\r\nthe world, or at least none that ever I have met with in the\r\ndifferent quarters I have visited, are handsomer than the English, in\r\npoint of complexion and features. This is a fact which Frenchmen\r\nthemselves admit; but for grace, say they, our countrywomen stand\r\nunrivalled, I am rather inclined to subscribe to this opinion. In a\r\nwell-educated French woman, there is an ease, an affability, a desire\r\nto please and be pleased, which not only render her manners\r\npeculiarly engaging, but also influence her gait, her gestures, her\r\nwhole deportment in short, and captivate admiration. Her natural\r\ncheerfulness and vivacity spread over her features an animation\r\nseldom to be found in our English fair, whose general characteristics\r\nare reserve and coldness. Hence that striking expression which\r\nexhibits the grace of the French belles to superior advantage.\r\n\r\nAlthough my memory frequently disappoints me when I wish to retain\r\nnames, I have contrived to recollect those of three of the most\r\nremarkable women in the ball-room. I shall therefore commit them to\r\npaper before I forget them. Madame la Princesse de Santa-Croce\r\ndisplayed more diamonds than any of her competitors; Mademoiselle\r\nLescot was the best dancer among several ladies renowned for dancing;\r\nand Madame Tallien was, on the whole, the handsomest female that I\r\nsaw in the room. There might possibly be women more beautiful than\r\nshe at this ball, but they did not come under my observation.\r\n\r\nI had previously seen Madame Tallien at the _Opera Buffa_, and was\r\nstruck by her appearance before, I knew who she was. On seeing her\r\nagain at the _Salon des Étrangers_, I inquired of a French lady of my\r\nacquaintance, whose understanding and discernment are pre-eminent, if\r\nMadame T------ had nothing to recommend her but her personal\r\nattractions? The lady's answer is too remarkable for me not to repeat\r\nit, which I will do _verbatim_. \"In Madame T------,\" said she,\r\n\"beauty, wit, goodness of heart, grace, talents, all are united. In a\r\ngay world, where malice subsists in all its force, her\r\ninconsistencies alone have been talked of, without any mention being\r\nmade of the numerous acts of beneficence which have balanced, if they\r\nhave not effaced, her weakness. Would you believe,\" continued she,\r\n\"that, in Paris, the grand theatre of misconduct, where moral\r\nobligations are so much disregarded, where we daily commit actions\r\nwhich we condemn in others; would you believe, that Madame T------\r\nexperiences again and again the mortification of being deprived of\r\nthe society of this, or that woman who has nothing to boast of but\r\nher depravity, and cannot plead one act of kindness, or even\r\nindulgence? This picture is very dark,\" added she, \"but the colouring\r\nis true.\"--\"What you tell me,\" observed I, \"proves that,\r\nnotwithstanding the irruption of immorality, attributed to the\r\nrevolution, it is still necessary for a woman to preserve appearances\r\nat least, in order to be received here in what is termed the best\r\ncompany.\"--\"Yes, indeed,\" replied she; \"if a woman neglects that main\r\npoint in Paris, she will soon find herself lowered in the opinion of\r\nthe fashionable world, and be at last excluded from even the\r\nsecondary circles. In London, your people of fashion are not quite so\r\nrigid.\"--\"If a husband chooses to wink at his wife's incontinence,\"\r\nrejoined I, \"the world on our side of the water is sufficiently\r\ncomplaisant to follow his example. Now with you, character is made to\r\ndepend more on the observance of etiquette; and, certainly,\r\nhypocrisy, when detected, is of more prejudice to society than\r\nbarefaced profligacy.\"--The lady then resumed thus concerning the\r\nsubject of my inquiry. \"Were some people to hear me,\" said she, \"they\r\nmight think that I had drawn you a flattering portrait of Madame\r\nT------ and say, by way of contrast, when the devil became old, he\r\nturned hermit; but I should answer that, for some years, no\r\ntwenty-four hours have elapsed without persons, whom I could name on\r\noccasion, having begun their daily career by going to see her, who\r\nsaved their life, when, to accomplish that object, she hazarded her\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nHere then is an additional instance of the noble energy manifested by\r\nwomen during the most calamitous periods of the revolution.\r\nUnappalled by the terrors of captivity or of death, their sensibility\r\nimpelled them to brave the ferocity of sanguinary tyrants, in order\r\nto administer hope or comfort to a parent, a husband, a relation, or\r\na friend. Some of these heroines, though in the bloom of youth, not\r\ncontent with sympathizing in the misfortunes of others, gave\r\nthemselves up as a voluntary sacrifice, rather than survive those\r\nwhose preservation they valued more than their own existence. Rome\r\nmay vaunt her Porcia, or her Cornelia; but the page of her history\r\ncan produce no such exaltation of the female character as has been\r\nexhibited within the last ten years by French women. Examples, like\r\nthese, of generosity, fortitude, and greatness of soul, deserve to be\r\nrecorded to the end of time, as they do honour to the sex, and to\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nIf, according to the scale of Parisian enjoyment, a ball or rout is\r\ndull and insipid, _à moins qu'on ne manque d'y être étouffé_, how\r\nsupreme must have been the satisfaction of the company at the _Salon\r\ndes Étrangers!_ The number present, estimated at seven or eight\r\nhundred, occasioned so great a crowd that it was by no means an easy\r\nenterprise to pass from one room to another. Of course, there was no\r\nopportunity of viewing the apartments to advantage; however, I saw\r\nenough of them to remark that they formed a suite elegantly\r\ndecorated. Some persons amused themselves with cards, though the\r\ngreat majority neither played nor danced, but were occupied in\r\nconversing with their acquaintance, There was no regular supper, but\r\nsubstantial refreshments of every kind were to be procured on paying;\r\nand other smaller ones, _gratis_.\r\n\r\nFrom the tickets not being transferable, and the bearer's name being\r\ninserted in each of them, the company was far more select than it\r\ncould have been without such a restriction. Most of the foreign\r\nambassadors, envoys, &c. were present, and many of the most\r\ndistinguished persons of both sexes in Paris. More regard was paid to\r\nthe etiquette of dress at this ball than, I have ever witnessed here\r\non similar occasions, The ladies, as I have before said, were all _en\r\ngrande toilette_; and the men with cocked hats, and in shoes and\r\nstockings, which is a novelty here, I assure you, as they mostly\r\nappear in boots. But what surprised me not a little, was to observe\r\nseveral inconsiderate French youths wear black cockades. Should they\r\npersist in such an absurdity, I shall be still more surprised, if\r\nthey escape admonition from the police. This fashion seemed to be the\r\n_ignis fatuus_ of the moment; it was never before exhibited in\r\npublic, and probably will be but of ephemeral duration.\r\n\r\nI cannot take leave of this ball without communicating to you a\r\ncircumstance which occurred there, and which, from the extravagant\r\ncredulity it exhibits in regard to the effects of sympathy, may\r\npossibly amuse you for a moment.\r\n\r\nA widow, about twenty years of age, more to be admired for the\r\nsymmetry of her person, than for the beauty of her features, had,\r\naccording to the prevailing custom, intrusted her pocket-handkerchief\r\nto the care of a male friend, a gentlemanlike young Frenchman of my\r\nacquaintance. After dancing, the lady finding herself rather warm,\r\napplied for her handkerchief, with which she wiped her forehead, and\r\nreturned it to the gentleman, who again put it into his pocket. He\r\nthen danced, but not with her; and, being also heated, he, by\r\nmistake, took out the lady's handkerchief, which, when applied to his\r\nface, produced, as he fancied, such an effect on him, that, though he\r\nhad previously regarded her with a sort of indifference, from that\r\nmoment she engaged all his attention, and he was unable to direct his\r\neyes, or even his thoughts, to any other object.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers, as is well known, have maintained that from all\r\nbodies there is an emanation of corpuscles, which, coming into\r\ncontact with our organs, make on the brain an impression, either more\r\nor less sympathetic, or of a directly-opposite nature. They tell you,\r\nfor instance, that of two women whom you behold for the first time,\r\nthe one the least handsome will sometimes please you most, because\r\nthere exists a greater _sympathy_ between you and her, than between\r\nyou and the more beautiful woman. Without attempting to refute this\r\nabsurd doctrine of corpuscles, I shall only observe that this young\r\nFrenchman is completely smitten, and declares that no woman in the\r\nworld can be compared to the widow.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance reminds me of a still more remarkable effect,\r\nascribed to a similar cause, experienced by Henry III of France. The\r\nmarriage of the king of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV, with Marguerite\r\nde Valois, and that of the Prince de Condé with Marie de Cleves, was\r\ncelebrated at the Louvre on the 10th of August, 1572. Marie de\r\nCleves, then a most lovely creature only sixteen, after dancing much,\r\nfinding herself incommoded by the heat of the ball-room, retired to a\r\nprivate apartment, where one of the waiting-women of the\r\nqueen-dowager, seeing her in a profuse perspiration, persuaded her\r\nto make an entire change of dress. She had scarcely left the room\r\nwhen the Duke of Anjou, afterwards Henry III, who had also danced a\r\ngreat deal, entered it to adjust his hair, and, being overheated,\r\nwiped his face with the first thing that he found, which happened\r\nto be the shift she had just taken off. Returning to the ball, he\r\nfixed his eyes on her, and contemplated her with as much surprise\r\nas if he had never before beheld her. His emotion, his transports,\r\nand the attention which he began to pay her, were the more\r\nextraordinary, as during the preceding week, which she had passed\r\nat court, he appeared indifferent to those very charms which now\r\nmade on his heart an impression so warm and so lasting. In short,\r\nhe became insensible to every thing that did not relate to his\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nHis election to the crown of Poland, say historians, far from\r\nflattering him, appeared to him an exile, and when he was in that\r\nkingdom, absence, far from diminishing his love, seemed to increase\r\nit. Whenever he addressed the princess, he pricked his finger, and\r\nnever wrote to her but with his blood. No sooner was he informed of\r\nthe death of Charles IX, than he dispatched a courier to assure her\r\nthat she should soon be queen of France; and, on his return, his\r\nthoughts were solely bent on dissolving her marriage with the Prince\r\nde Condé, which, on account of the latter being a protestant, he\r\nexpected to accomplish. But this determination proved fatal to the\r\nprincess; for, shortly after, she was attacked by a violent illness,\r\nattributed to poison, which carried her off in the flower of her age.\r\n\r\nNo words can paint Henry's despair at this event: he passed several\r\ndays in tears and groans; and when he was at length obliged to shew\r\nhimself in public, he appeared in deep mourning, and entirely covered\r\nwith emblems of death, even to his very shoe-strings.\r\n\r\nThe Princess de Condé had been dead upwards of four months, and\r\nburied in the abbey-church of _St. Germain-des-Prés_, when Henry, on\r\nentering the abbey, whither he was invited to a grand entertainment\r\ngiven there by Cardinal de Bourbon, felt such violent tremblings at\r\nhis heart, that not being able to endure their continuance, he was\r\ngoing away; but they ceased all at once, on the body of the princess\r\nbeing removed from its tomb, and conveyed elsewhere for that evening.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Catherine de Medicis, by prevailing on him to marry\r\nLouise de Vaudemont, one of the most beautiful women in Europe, hoped\r\nthat she would make him forget her whom death had snatched from him,\r\nand he himself perhaps indulged a similar hope, but the memoirs of\r\nthose times concur in asserting that the image of the Princess de\r\nCondé was never effaced from his heart, and that, to the day of his\r\nassassination, which did not happen till seventeen years after,\r\nwhatever efforts he made to subdue his passion, were wholly\r\nunavailing.\r\n\r\nSympathy is a sentiment to which few persons attach the same ideas.\r\nIt may be classed in three distinct species. The first seems to have\r\nan immediate connexion with the senses; the second, with the heart;\r\nand the third, with the mind. Although it cannot be denied that the\r\npreference we bestow on this or that woman is the result of the one\r\nor the other of these, or even of all three together; yet the\r\nanalysis of our attachments is, in some cases, so difficult as to\r\ndefy the investigation of reason. For, as the old song says, some\r\nlovers\r\n\r\n  Will \"whimper and whine\r\n  For lilies and roses,\r\n  For eyes, lips, and noses,\r\n  Or a _tip of an ear_.\"\r\n\r\nTo cut the matter short, I think it fully proved, by the example of\r\nsome of the wisest men, that the affections are often captivated by\r\nsomething indefinable, or, in the words of Corneille,\r\n\r\n  _\"Par un je ne sais quoi--qu'on ne peut exprimer.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 14, 1801._\r\n\r\nI have already spoken to you of the _Pont Neuf_. To the east of it,\r\nas you will see by the Plan of Paris, the small islands in the middle\r\nof the Seine are connected to its banks by several bridges; while to\r\nthe west, there are two only, though a third is projected, and,\r\npreviously to the late rise of the river, workmen were employed in\r\ndriving piles for the foundation. I shall now describe to you these\r\ntwo bridges, beginning with the\r\n\r\nPONT NATIONAL.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, this bridge bore the appellation of _Pont\r\nRoyal_, from its having been built by Lewis XIV, and the expenses\r\ndefrayed but of his privy purse, to supply the place of one of wood,\r\nsituated opposite to the _Louvre_, which was carried away by the ice\r\nin 1684. It is reckoned one of the most solid bridges in Paris, and,\r\ntill the existence of the _Pont de la Concorde_, was the only one\r\nbuilt across the river, without taking advantage of the islands\r\nabove-mentioned. It stands on four piles, forming with the two\r\nabutments five elliptical arches of a handsome sweep. The span of the\r\ncentre arch is seventy-two feet, that of the two adjoining sixty-six,\r\nand that of the two outer ones sixty. On each side is a raised\r\npavement for foot-passengers, in the middle of which I should imagine\r\nthat there is breadth sufficient to admit of four carriages passing\r\nabreast.\r\n\r\nGABRIEL had undertaken this bridge from the designs of MANSARD. The\r\nwork was already in a state of forwardness, when, at a pile on the\r\nside of the _Faubourg St. Germain_, the former could not succeed in\r\nexcluding the water. A Jacobin, not a clubist, but a Jacobin friar,\r\none FRANÇOIS ROMAIN, who had just finished the bridge of Strasburg,\r\nwas sent for by the king to the assistance of the French architects,\r\nand had the honour of completing the rest of the work.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Henry IV, there was no bridge over this part of the\r\nriver, which he used frequently to cross in the first boat that\r\npresented itself. Returning one day from the chace, in a plain\r\nhunting dress, and having with him only two or three gentlemen, he\r\nstepped into a skiff to be carried over from the _Faubourg St.\r\nGermain_ to the _Tuileries_. Perceiving that he was not known by the\r\nwaterman, he asked him what people said of the peace, meaning the\r\npeace of Vervins, which was just concluded. \"Faith! I don't\r\nunderstand this sort of peace,\" answered the waterman; \"there are\r\ntaxes on every thing, and even, on this miserable boat, with which I\r\nhave a hard matter to earn my bread.\"--\"And does not the king,\"\r\ncontinued Henry, \"intend to lighten these taxes?\"--\"The king is a\r\ngood kind of man enough,\" replied the waterman; \"but he has a lady\r\nwho must needs have so many fine gowns and gewgaws; and 'tis we who\r\npay for all that. One would not think so much of it either, if she\r\nkept to him only; but, they say, she suffers herself to be kissed by\r\nmany others.\"\r\n\r\nHenry IV was so amused by this conversation, that, the next morning,\r\nhe sent for the waterman, and made him repeat, word for word, before\r\nthe Dutchess of Beaufort, all that he had said the preceding evening.\r\nThe Dutchess, much irritated, was for having him hanged. \"You are a\r\nfoolish woman,\" said Henry; \"this is a poor devil whom poverty has\r\nput out of humour. In future, he shall pay no tax for his boat, and I\r\nam convinced that he will then sing every day, _Vive Henri! Vive\r\nGabrielle!_\"\r\n\r\nThe north end of the _Pont National_ faces the wing of the palace of\r\nthe _Tuileries_ distinguished by the name of the _Pavillon de Flore_.\r\nFrom the middle of this bridge, you see the city in a striking point\r\nof view. Here, the celebrated Marshal de Catinat used frequently to\r\nmake it part of his morning's amusement to take his stand, and, while\r\nhe enjoyed the beauty of the prospect, he opened his purse to the\r\nindigent as they passed. That philosophic warrior often declared that\r\nhe never beheld any thing equal to the _coup d'oeil_ from this\r\nstation. In fact, on the one side, you discover the superb gallery of\r\nthe _Louvre_, extending from that palace to the _Tuileries_; and, on\r\nthe other, the _Palais du Corps Législatif_, and a long range of\r\nother magnificent buildings, skirting the quays on each bank of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThese quays, nearly to the number of thirty, are faced with stone,\r\nand crowned with parapets breast high, which, in eighteen or twenty\r\ndifferent spots, open to form watering-places. The Seine, being thus\r\nconfined within its bed, the eye is never displeased here by the\r\nsight of muddy banks like those of the Thames, or the nose offended\r\nby the smell arising from the filth which the common sewers convey to\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nThe galiot of _St. Cloud_ regularly takes its departure from the\r\n_Pont National_. Formerly, on Sundays and holidays, it used to be a\r\nvery entertaining sight to contemplate the Paris cocknies crowding\r\ninto this vessel. Those who arrived too late, jumped into the first\r\nempty boat, which frequently overset, either through the\r\nunskilfulness of the waterman, or from being overloaded. In\r\nconsequence of such accidents, the boats of the Seine are prohibited\r\nfrom taking more than sixteen passengers.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, an excursion to _St. Cloud_ by water, was an\r\nimportant voyage to some of the Parisians, as you may see by\r\nreferring to the picture which has been drawn of it, under the title\r\nof \"_Voyage de Paris à Saint Cloud par mer, et le retour de Saint\r\nCloud à Paris par terre_.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the banks of the Seine, towards the west, we next come to\r\nthe\r\n\r\nPONT DE LA CONCORDE.\r\n\r\nThis bridge, which had long been wished for and projected, was begun\r\nin 1787, and finished in 1790. Its southern extremity stands opposite\r\nto the _Palais du Corps Législatif_; while that of the north faces\r\nthe _Place de la Concorde_, whence it not only derives its present\r\nappellation, but has always experienced every change of name to which\r\nthe former has been subject.\r\n\r\nThe lightness of its apearance is less striking to those who have\r\nseen the _Pont de Neuilly_, in which PERRONET, Engineer of bridges\r\nand highways, has, by the construction of arches nearly flat, so\r\neminently distinguished himself. He is likewise the architect of this\r\nbridge, which is four hundred and sixty-two feet in length by\r\nforty-eight in breadth. Like the _Pont National_, it consists of\r\nfive elliptical arches. The span of the centre arch is ninety-six\r\nfeet; that of the collateral ones, eighty-seven; and that of the\r\ntwo others near the abutments, sixty-eight. Under one of the latter\r\nis a tracking-path for the facility of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe piles, which are each nine feet in thickness, have, on their\r\nstarlings, a species of pillars that support a cornice five feet and\r\na half high. Perpendicularly to these pillars are to rise as many\r\npyramids, which are to be crowned by a parapet with a balustrade: in\r\nall these, it is intended to display no less elegance of workmanship\r\nthan the arches present boldness of design and correctness of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nOn crossing these bridges, it has often occurred to me, how much the\r\nParisians must envy us the situation of our metropolis. If the Seine,\r\nlike the Thames, presented the advantage of braving the moderate\r\nwinds, and of conveying, by regular tides, the productions of the\r\nfour quarters of the globe to the quays which skirt its banks, what\r\nan acquisition would it not be to their puny commerce! What a\r\ngratification to their pride to see ships discharging their rich\r\ncargoes at the foot of the _Pont de la Concorde_! The project of the\r\ncanal of Languedoc must, at first, have apparently presented greater\r\nobstacles; yet, by talents and perseverance, these were overcome at a\r\ntime when the science of machinery of every description was far less\r\nunderstood than it is at the present moment.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the account of Abbon, a monk of the abbey of St.\r\nGermain-des-Prés, that, in the year 885, the Swedes, Danes, and\r\nNormans, to the number of forty-five thousand men, came to lay siege\r\nto Paris, with seven hundred sail of ships, exclusively of the\r\nsmaller craft, so that, according to this historian, who was an\r\neye-witness of the fact, the river Seine was covered with their\r\nvessels for the space of two leagues.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar tells us, in the third book of his Commentaries, that,\r\nat the time of his conquest of the Gauls, in the course of one\r\nwinter, he constructed six hundred vessels of the wood which then\r\ngrew in the environs of Paris; and that, in the following spring, he\r\nembarked his army, horse and foot, provisions and baggage, in these\r\nvessels, descended the Seine, reached Dieppe, and thence crossed over\r\nto England, of which, he says, he made a conquest.\r\n\r\nAbout forty years ago, the scheme engaged much attention. In 1759,\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, Belles-Lettres, and Arts of Rouen, proposed\r\nthe following as a prize-question: \"Was not the Seine formerly\r\nnavigable for vessels of greater burden than those which are now\r\nemployed on it; and are there not means to restore to it, or to\r\nprocure it, that advantage?\" In 1760, the prize was adjourned; the\r\nmemoirs presented not being to the satisfaction of the Academy. In\r\n1761, the new candidates having no better success, the subject was\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding this discouragement, we find that, on the\r\n1st of August, 1766, Captain Berthelot actually reached the _Pont\r\nRoyal_ in a vessel of one hundred and sixty tons burden. When, on the\r\n22d of the same month, he departed thence, loaded with merchandise,\r\nthe depth of the water in the Seine was twenty-five feet, and it was\r\nnearly the same when he ascended the river. This vessel was seven\r\ndays on her passage from Rouen to Paris: but a year or two ago, four\r\ndays only were employed in performing the same voyage by another\r\nvessel, named the _Saumon_.\r\n\r\nEngineers have ever judged the scheme practicable, and the estimate\r\nof the necessary works, signed by several skilful surveyors, was\r\nsubmitted to the ministry of that day. The amount was forty-six\r\nmillions of livres (circa £1,916,600 sterling).\r\n\r\nBut what can compensate for the absence of the tide? This is an\r\nadvantage, which, in a commercial point of view, must ever insure to\r\nLondon a decided superiority over Paris. Were the Seine to-morrow\r\nrendered navigable for vessels of large burden, they must, for a\r\nconsiderable distance, be tracked against the stream, or wait till a\r\nsuccession of favourable winds had enabled them to stem it through\r\nits various windings; whereas nothing can be more favourable to\r\nnavigation than the position of London. It has every advantage of a\r\nsea-port without its dangers. Had it been placed lower down, that is,\r\nnearer to the mouth of the Thames, it would have been more exposed to\r\nthe insults of a foreign enemy, and also to the insalubrious\r\nexhalations of the swampy marshes. Had it been situated higher up the\r\nriver, it would have been inaccessible to ships of large burden.\r\n\r\nThus, by no effort of human invention or industry can Paris rival\r\nLondon in commerce, even on the supposition that France could produce\r\nas many men possessed of the capital and spirit of enterprise, for\r\nwhich our British merchants are at present unrivalled.\r\n\r\nYet, may not this pre-eminence in commercial prosperity lead to our\r\ndestruction, as the gigantic conquests of France may also pave the\r\nway to her ruin? Alas! the experience of ages proves this melancholy\r\ntruth, which has also been repeated by Raynal: \"Commerce,\" says that\r\ncelebrated writer, \"in the end finds its ruin in the riches which it\r\naccumulates, as every powerful state lays the foundation of its own\r\ndestruction in extending its conquests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 16, 1801._\r\n\r\nNo part of the engagement into which I have entered with you, so\r\nfully convinces me of my want of reflection, and shews that my zeal,\r\nat the time, got the better of my judgment, as my promising you some\r\nideas on\r\n\r\nFRENCH LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nIt would, I now perceive, be necessary to have inhabited France for\r\nseveral years past, with the determined intention of observing this\r\ngreat empire solely in that single point of view, to be able to keep\r\nmy word in a manner worthy of you and of the subject. It would be\r\nnecessary to write a large volume of rational things; and, in a\r\nletter, I ought to relate them with conciseness and truth; draw\r\nsketches with rapidity, but clearness; in short, express positive\r\nresults, without deviating from abstractions and generalities, since\r\nyou require from me, on this subject, no more than a letter, and not\r\na book.\r\n\r\nI come to the point. I shall consider literature in a double sense.\r\nFirst, the thing in itself; then, its connexions with the sciences,\r\nand the men who govern. In England, it has been thought, or at least\r\ninsinuated in some of the papers and periodical publications, that\r\nliterature had been totally annihilated in France within the last\r\ntwelve years. This is a mistake: its aberrations have been taken for\r\neclipses. It has followed the revolution through all its phases.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constituent Assembly, the literary genius of the French was\r\nturned towards politics and eloquence. There remain valuable\r\nmonuments of the fleeting existence of that assembly. MIRABEAU,\r\nBARNAVE, CAZALÈS, MAURY, and thirty other capital writers, attest\r\nthis truth. Nothing fell from their lips or their pen that did not\r\nhear at the same time the stamp of philosophy and literature.\r\n\r\nUnder the Legislative Assembly and the Convention, the establishments\r\nof the empire of letters were little respected. Literati themselves\r\nbecame victims of the political collisions of their country; but\r\nliterature was constantly cultivated under several forms. Those who\r\nshewed themselves its oppressors, were obliged to assume the refined\r\nlanguage which it alone can supply, and that, at the very time when\r\nthey declared war against it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Directorial government, France, overwhelmed by the weight\r\nof her long misfortunes, first cast her eye on the construction of a\r\nnew edifice, dedicated to human knowledge in general, under the name\r\nof _National Institute_. Literature there collected its remains, and\r\nthose who cultivate it, as members of this establishment, are not\r\nunworthy of their office. Such as are not admitted into this society,\r\nnotwithstanding all the claims the most generally acknowledged, owe\r\nthis omission to moral or political causes only, on which I could not\r\ntouch, without occupying myself about persons rather than the thing\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe French revolution, which has levelled so many gigantic fortunes,\r\nis said (by its advocates) to have really spread a degree of comfort\r\namong the inferior classes. Indeed, if there are in France, as may be\r\nsupposed, much fewer persons rolling in riches, there are, I am\r\ninformed, much fewer pining in indigence. This observation, admitting\r\nit to be strictly true, may, with great propriety, be applied to\r\nFrench literature. France no longer has a VOLTAIRE or a ROUSSEAU, to\r\nwield the sceptre of the literary world; but she has a number of\r\nliterary degrees of public interest or simple amusement, which are\r\nperfectly well filled. Few literati are without employ, and still\r\nfewer are beneath their functions. The place of member of the\r\nInstitute is a real public function remunerated by the State. It is\r\nto this cause, and to a few others, which will occur to you\r\nbeforehand, that we must attribute the character of gravity which\r\nliterature begins to assume in this country. The prudery of the\r\nschool of DORAT would here be hissed. Here, people will not quarrel\r\nwith the Graces; but they will no longer make any sacrifice to them\r\nat the expense of common sense.\r\n\r\nIn this literary republic still exist, as you may well conceive, the\r\nsame passions, the same littleness, the same intrigues as formerly\r\nfor arriving at celebrity, and keeping in that envied sphere; but all\r\nthis makes much less noise at the present juncture. It is this which\r\nhas induced the belief that literature had diminished its intensity,\r\nboth in form and object: that is another mistake. The French literati\r\nare mostly a noisy class, who love to make themselves conspicuous,\r\neven by the clashing of their pretensions; but, to the great regret\r\nof several among them, people in this country now attach a rational\r\nimportance only to their quarrels, which formerly attracted universal\r\nattention. The revolution has been so great an event; it has\r\noverthrown such great interests; that no one here can any longer\r\nflatter himself with exciting a personal interest, except by\r\nperforming the greatest actions.\r\n\r\nI must also make a decisive confession on this matter, and\r\nacknowledge that literature, which formerly held the first degree in\r\nthe scale of the moral riches of this nation, is likely to decline in\r\npriority and influence. The sciences have claimed and obtained in the\r\npublic mind a superiority resulting from the very nature of their\r\nobject; I mean utility. The title of _savant_ is not more brilliant\r\nthan formerly; but it is more imposing; it leads to consequence, to\r\nsuperior employments, and, above all, to riches. The sciences have\r\ndone so much for this people during their revolution, that, whether\r\nthrough instinct, or premeditated gratitude, they have declared their\r\npartiality towards the _savans_, or men of science, to the detriment\r\nof the mere literati. The sciences are nearly allied both to pride\r\nand national interest; while literature concerns only the vanity and\r\ninterest of a few individuals. This difference must have been felt,\r\nand of itself alone have fixed the esteem of the public, and\r\ngraduated their suffrages according to the merit of the objects.\r\nRegard being had to their specific importance, I foresee that this\r\nnatural classification will be attended with happy consequences, both\r\nfor sciences and literature.\r\n\r\nI have been enabled to observe that very few men of science are\r\nunacquainted with the literature of their country, whether for\r\nseeking in it pleasing relaxation, or for borrowing from it a magic\r\nstyle, a fluent elocution, a harmony, a pomp of expression, with\r\nwhich the most abstract meditations can no longer dispense to be\r\nreceived favourably by philosophers and men of taste. Very few\r\nliterati, on the other hand, are unacquainted with philosophy and the\r\nsciences, and, above all, with natural knowledge; whether not to be\r\ntoo much in arrear with the age in which they live, and which\r\nevidently inclines to the study of Nature, or to give more colour and\r\nconsistence to their thoughts, by multiplying their degrees of\r\ncomparison with the eternal type of all that is great and fertile.\r\n\r\nIt has been so often repeated that HOMER, OSSIAN, and MILTON, knew\r\nevery thing known in their times; that they were at once the greatest\r\nnatural philosophers and the best moralists of their age, that this\r\ntruth has made an impression on most of the adepts in literature; and\r\nas the impulse is given, and the education of the present day by the\r\nretrenchment of several unnecessary pursuits, has left, in the mind\r\nof the rising generation, vacancies fit to be filled by a great\r\nvariety of useful acquirements, it appears to me demonstrated, on\r\nfollowing analogy, and the gradations of human improvement, that the\r\nsciences, philosophy, and literature will some day have in France but\r\none common domain, as they there have at present, with the arts, only\r\none central point of junction.\r\n\r\nThe French government has flattered the literati and artists, by\r\ncalling them in great numbers round it and its ministers, either to\r\ngive their advice in matters of taste, or to serve as a decoration to\r\nits power, and an additional lustre to the crown of glory with which\r\nit is endeavouring to encircle itself; but, in general, the palpable,\r\nsubstantial, and solid distinctions have been reserved for men of\r\nscience, chymists, naturalists, and mathematicians: they have seats\r\nin the Senate, in the Tribunate, in the Council of State, and in all\r\nthe Administrations; while LAHARPE, the veteran of French literature,\r\nis not even a member of the Institute, and is reduced to give\r\nlessons, which are, undoubtedly, not only very interesting to the\r\npublic, but also very profitable to himself, and produce him as much\r\nmoney, at least, as his knowledge has acquired him reputation.\r\n\r\nIt results from what I have said, that French literature has not\r\nexperienced any apparent injury from the revolutionary storm: it has\r\nonly changed its direction and means: it has still remaining talents\r\nwhich have served their time, talents in their maturity, and talents\r\nin a state of probation, and of much promise.\r\n\r\nPersons of reflection entertain great hopes from the violent shock\r\ngiven to men's minds by the revolution; from that silent inquietude\r\nstill working in their hearts; from that sap, full of life,\r\ncirculating with rapidity through this body politic. \"The factions\r\nare muzzled,\" say they; \"but the factious spirit still ferments under\r\nthe curb of power; if means can be found to force it to evaporate on\r\nobjects which belong to the domain of illusion and sensibility, the\r\nresult will prove a great blessing to France, by carrying back to the\r\narts and to literature, and even to commerce, that exuberance of heat\r\nand activity which can no longer be employed without danger on\r\npolitical subjects.\"\r\n\r\nThe same men, whom I have just pointed out, affirm that England\r\nherself will feel, in her literary and scientific system, a salutary\r\nconcussion from the direction given here to the public mind. They\r\nexpect with impatience that the British government will engage in\r\nsome great measure of public utility, in order that the rivalship\r\nsubsisting between the two nations on political and military points,\r\nwhich have no longer any object, may soon become, in France, the most\r\nactive and most powerful vehicle for different parts of her interior\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nOf all kinds of literature, _Epic Poetry_ is the only one in which\r\nFrance has not obtained such success as to place her on a level with\r\nTASSO and MILTON. To make amends, her poets have followed with\r\nadvantage the steps of ARIOSTO, without being able to surpass him.\r\nFrom this school have issued two modern epic poems: _La guerre des\r\ndieux payens contre les dieux chretiens_, by PARNY and _La conquête\r\nde Naples_, by GUDIN. The former is distinguished by an easy\r\nversification, and an imagination jocose and fertile, though,\r\ncertainly, far too licentious. Educated in the school of DORAT, he\r\npossesses his redundance and grace, without his fatuity. His elegies\r\nare worthy of TIBULLUS; and his fugitive pieces are at once dictated\r\nby wit and sentiment: thus it was that CHAULIEU wrote, but with more\r\nnegligence. The latter has thought to compensate for the energy and\r\ngrace that should give life to his subject (which he considers only\r\nin a playful and satirical light), by a truly tiresome multitude of\r\nincidents. Conceive three huge volumes in octavo, for a poem which\r\nrequired but one of a moderate size, and, in them, a versification\r\nfrequently negligent. These are two serious faults, which the French\r\nwill not readily overlook. No where are critics more severe, on the\r\none hand, against redundance that is steril, and on the other,\r\nrespecting the essential composition of verse, which ought always to\r\nflow with grace, even when under restraint. Catholicism, however, has\r\nno more reason to be pleased with the loose scenes presented in this\r\nwork, than christianity, in general, has with the licentious pictures\r\nof PARNY; but GUDIN is far less dangerous to Rome, because he will be\r\nless read.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have devoted their labours to _Tragedy_, during the\r\ncourse of the revolution. CHÉNIER has produced a whole theatre, which\r\nwill remain to posterity, notwithstanding his faults, as he has\r\ncontrived to cover them with beauties. ARNAULT and MERCIER of\r\nCompiegne are two young authors that seem to have been educated in\r\nthe school of DUCIS, who is at this day the father of all the present\r\ntragic writers. The pieces which they have produced have met with\r\nsome success, and are of considerable promise.\r\n\r\n_Comedy_ lost a vigorous supporter under the tyranny of ROBESPIERRE.\r\nThis was FABRE D'EGLANTINE. That poet seldom failed of success, drew\r\nnone but bold characters, and placed himself, by his own merit,\r\nbetween MOLIÈRE and DESTOUCHES. COLIN D'HARLEVILLE and LEGOUVÉ\r\nproduce agreeable pieces which succeed. They paint, with an easy and\r\ngraceful pencil, the absurdities and humours of society; but their\r\npieces are deficient in plot and action. FABRÉ D'EGLANTINE\r\npourtrayed, in striking colours, those frightful vices which are\r\nbeyond the reach of the law. His pieces are strongly woven and easily\r\nunravelled. PICARD seems to have taken GOLDONI, the celebrated\r\nVenetian comic writer, for his model. Like him, an excellent painter,\r\na writer by impulse, he produces, with wonderful fecundity, a number\r\nof interesting comedies, which make the audience laugh till they shed\r\ntears, and how and then give great lessons. PALISSOT, CAILHAVA, and\r\nMERCIER are still living; but no longer produce any thing striking.\r\n\r\nI shall say little of French eloquence. Under the new form of\r\ngovernment, orators have less opportunity and less scope for\r\ndisplaying transscendant talents than during the first years of the\r\nrevolution. Two members of the government, CAMBACÉRÈS and LEBRUN,\r\nhave distinguished themselves in this career by close, logical\r\nargument, bright conceptions, and discriminating genius. BENJAMIN\r\nCONSTANT and GUINGUÉNÉ, members of the Tribunate, shewed themselves\r\nto advantage last year, as I understand, in some productions full of\r\nenergy and wisdom. DEMEUNIER and BOISSI D'ANGLAS are already, in the\r\nTribunate, veterans of eloquence; but the man who unites, in this\r\nrespect, all the approbation of that body, and even of France, is\r\nDAUNOU. In exterior means he is deficient; but his thoughts proceed\r\nat once from a warm heart and an open mind, guided by a superior\r\ngenius; and his expressions manifest the source from which they flow.\r\n\r\nSeveral capital works of the historic kind have made their appearance\r\nin France within the last ten years; but, with the exception of those\r\nof celebrated voyagers or travellers, such as LA PÉROUSE, BAUDIN,\r\nSONNINI, LABILLARDIÈRE, OLIVIER, ANDRÉ MICHAUD, &c. those whose\r\nobject has been to treat of the arts, sciences, and manners of\r\nGreece, such as the travels of Anacharsis, of Pythagoras, or of\r\nAntenor; those whose subject has not been confined to France, such as\r\nthe _Précis de l'histoire générale_, by ANQUETIL; people ought to be\r\non their guard against the merit even of productions written\r\nmediately or immediately on the revolution, its causes, and\r\nconsequences. The passions are not yet sufficiently calmed for us not\r\nto suspect the spirit of party to interpose itself between men and\r\ntruth. The most splendid talents are frequently in this line only the\r\nmost faithless guide. It is affirmed, however, that there are a few\r\nworks which recommend themselves, by the most philosophic\r\nimpartiality; but none of these have as yet fallen under my\r\nobservation. A striking production is expected from the pen of the\r\ncelebrated VOLNEY. This is a _Tableau Physique des États Unis_; but\r\nit is with regret I hear that its appearance is delayed by the\r\nauthor's indisposition.\r\n\r\n_Novels_ are born and die here, as among us, with astonishing\r\nabundance. The rage for evocations and magic spectres begins to\r\ndiminish. The French assert that they have borrowed it from us, and\r\nfrom the school of MRS. RADCLIFF, &c. &c. They also assert, that the\r\npolicy of the royalist-party was not unconnected with this\r\npropagation of cavernous, cadaverous adventures, ideas, and\r\nillusions, intended, they say, by the impression of a new moral\r\nterror to infatuate their countrymen again with the dull and\r\nsoporific prestiges of popery. They see with joy that the taste for\r\npleasure has assumed the ascendency, at least in Paris, and that\r\nnovels in the English style no longer make any one tremble, at night\r\nby the fireside, but the old beldams of the provincial departments.\r\n\r\nThe less important kinds of literature, such as the _Apologue_ or\r\n_Moral Fable_, which is not at this day much in fashion; the\r\n_Eclogue_ or _Idyl_, whose culture particularly belongs to agrestical\r\nand picturesque regions; _Political Satire_, which is never more\r\nrefined than under the influence of arbitrary power; these kinds, to\r\nwhich I might add the _Madrigal_ and _Epigram_, without being\r\naltogether abandoned, are not generally enough cultivated here to\r\nobtain special mention. I shall make an exception only in favour of\r\nthe pastoral poems of LECLERC (of Marne and Loire) of which I have\r\nheard a very favourable account.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a revolution which has had periods so ensanguined,\r\n_Romance_, (romantic poetry) must have been cultivated and held in\r\nrequest. It has been so, especially by sentimental minds, and not a\r\nlittle too through the spirit of party; this was likely to be the\r\ncase, since its most affecting characteristic is to mourn over tombs.\r\n\r\n_Lyric poetry_ has been carried by LEBRUN, CHÉNIER, &c. to a height\r\nworthy of JEAN BAPTISTE ROUSSEAU. The former, above all, will stand\r\nhis ground, by his weight, to the latest posterity; while hitherto\r\nthe lyric productions of CHÉNIER have not been able to dispense with\r\nthe charm of musical harmony. FONTANES, CUBIÈRES, PONS DE VERDUN,\r\nBAOUR-LORNIAN, and DESPAZE are secondary geniuses, who do not make us\r\nforget that DELISLE and the Chevalier BERTIN are still living; but\r\nwhose fugitive pieces sometimes display many charms.\r\n\r\nWhen you shall be made acquainted that Paris, of all the cities in\r\nthe world, is that where the rage for dancing is the most\r\n_nationalized_, where, from the gilded apartments of the most\r\nfashionable quarters to the smoky chambers of the most obscure\r\nsuburbs, there are executed more capers in cadence, than in any other\r\nplace on earth, you will not be surprised if I reserve a special\r\narticle for one of the kinds of literature that bears the most\r\naffinity to this distinctive diversion of the Parisian belles, which\r\nhas led MERCIER to say, that their city was the _guingette_ of\r\nEurope; I mean _Song_. Perhaps, a subject new and curious to treat\r\non, would be the influence of vocal music on the French revolution.\r\nEvery one knows that this people marched to battle singing; but,\r\nindependently of the subject being above my abilities, it would carry\r\nme too far beyond the limited plan which I have prescribed to myself.\r\n\r\nLet it suffice for you to know, that there has existed in Paris a\r\nsort of lyric manufactory, which, under the name of \"_Diners du\r\nvaudeville_\" scrupulously performed, for several years, an engagement\r\nto furnish, every month, a collection of songs very agreeable and\r\nvery captivating. These productions are pretty often full of\r\nallusions, more or less veiled, to the political events of the\r\nmoment; seldom, however, have they been handled as very offensive\r\nweapons against persons or institutions. The friends of mirth and\r\nwine are seldom dark and dangerous politicians. This country\r\npossesses a great number of them, who combine the talents required by\r\nthe gravest magistracy with all the levity of the most witty and most\r\ncheerful _bon vivant_. I shall quote at random FRANÇOIS DE\r\nNEUFCHÂTEAU, the two SÉGURS, PIIS, &c. &c. Others, such as BARRÉ,\r\nDESFONTAINES, and RADET, confine themselves to their exclusive\r\nfunctions of professed song-makers, and write only for the little\r\nmusical theatres, or for the leisure of their countrymen and their\r\nevening-amusements.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to terminate a sketch of the literature of France,\r\nwithout saying a word of such of the _Journals_ as I have yet\r\nperused, which are specially devoted to it. The _Mercure de France_\r\nis one of those held in most esteem; and habit, as well as the spirit\r\nof party, concurs in making the fortune of this journal. There exists\r\nanother, conducted by a member of the Institute, named POUGENS, under\r\nthe title of _Bibliothèque Française_, which is spoken of very\r\nfavourably. But that which appears every ten days, under the name of\r\n_Décade Philosophique_, is the best production of the sort. A society\r\nof literary men, prudent, well-informed, and warmly attached to their\r\ncountry, are its authors, and deposit in it a well-digested analysis\r\nof every thing new that appears in the arts, sciences, or literature.\r\nNevertheless, a labour so carefully performed, is perfectly\r\ndisinterested. This is the only enterprise of the kind that does not\r\nafford a livelihood to its associates, and is supported by a zeal\r\naltogether gratuitous.\r\n\r\nWithout seeking to blame or approve the title of this last-mentioned\r\njournal, I shall only remark that the word _Décade_, coupled with the\r\nword _Philosophique_, becomes in the eyes of many persons a double\r\ncause of reprobation; and that, at this day, more than ever, those\r\ntwo words are, in the opinion the most in fashion, marked by a\r\nproscription that is reflected on every thing which belongs to the\r\nscience of philosophy.\r\n\r\nThis would be the moment to inquire into the secret or ostensible\r\ncauses which have led to the retrograde course that is to be remarked\r\nin France in the ideas which have been hitherto reckoned as conducive\r\nto the advancement of reason. This would be the moment to observe the\r\nnew government of France endeavouring to balance, the one by the\r\nother, the opinions sprung from the Republic, and those daily\r\nconjured up from the Monarchy; holding in _equilibrio_ two colours of\r\ndoctrines so diametrically opposite, and consequently two parties\r\nequally dissatisfied at not being able to crush each other,\r\n_neutralizing_ them, in short, by its immense influence in the\r\nemployment of their strength, when they bewilder or exhaust\r\nthemselves uselessly for its interests; but I could not touch on\r\nthese matters, without travelling out of the domain of literature,\r\nwhich is the only one that is at present familiar to me, in order to\r\nenter into yours, where you have not leisure to direct me; and you\r\nmay conceive with what an ill grace I should appear, in making before\r\nyou, in politics, excursions, which, probably, would have for me the\r\ninconvenience of commanding great efforts, without leaving me the\r\nhope of adding any thing to your stock of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 18, 1801._\r\n\r\nDivided as Paris is by the Seine, it seldom happens that one has not\r\noccasion to cross it more than once in the course of the day. I shall\r\ntherefore make you acquainted with the bridges which connect to its\r\nbanks the islands situated in that part of the river I have not yet\r\n\r\ndescribed. Being out of my general track, I might otherwise forget to\r\nmake any further mention of them, which would be a manifest omission,\r\nnow you have before you the Plan of Paris.\r\n\r\nWe will also embrace the opportunity of visiting the _Palais de\r\nJustice_ and the Cathedral of _Notre-Dame_. East of the _Pont-Neuf_,\r\nwe first arrive at the\r\n\r\nPONT AU CHANGE.\r\n\r\nThis bridge, which leads from the north bank of the Seine to the _Ile\r\ndu Palais_, is one of the most ancient in Paris. Though, like all\r\nthose of which I have now to speak, it crosses but one channel of the\r\nriver, it was called the _Grand Pont_, till the year 1141, when it\r\nacquired its present name on Lewis VII establishing here all the\r\nmoney-changers of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was also called _Pont aux Oiseaux_, because bird-sellers were\r\npermitted to carry on their business here, on condition of letting\r\nloose two hundred dozen of birds, at the moment when kings and queens\r\npassed, in their way to the cathedral, on the day of their public\r\nentry. By this custom, it was intended to signify that, if the people\r\nhad been oppressed in the preceding reign, their rights, privileges,\r\nand liberties would be fully re-established under the new monarch.\r\n\r\nOn the public entry of Isabeau de Bavière, wife of Charles VI, a\r\nGenoese stretched a rope from the top of the towers of _Notre-Dame_\r\nto one of the houses on this bridge: he thence descended, dancing on\r\nthis rope, with a lighted torch in each hand. Habited as an angel, he\r\nplaced a crown on the head of the new queen, and reascending his\r\nrope, he appeared again in the air. The chronicle adds that, as it\r\nwas already dark, he was seen by all Paris and the environs.\r\n\r\nThis bridge was then of wood, and covered with houses also of wood.\r\nTwo fires, one of which happened in 1621, and the other in 1639,\r\noccasioned it to be rebuilt of stone in 1647.\r\n\r\nThe _Pont au Change_ consists of seven arches. Previously to the\r\ndemolition of the houses, which, till 1786, stood on each side of\r\nthis bridge, the passage was sufficiently wide for three carriages.\r\n\r\nTraversing the _Ile du Palais_ from north to south, in order to\r\nproceed from the _Pont au Change_ to the _Pont St. Michel_, we pass\r\nin front of the\r\n\r\nPALAIS DE JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the ninth century, this palace was begun by Eudes.\r\nIt was successively enlarged by Robert, son of Hugh Capet, by St.\r\nLewis, and by Philip the Fair. Under Charles V, who abandoned it to\r\noccupy the _Hôtel St. Paul_, which he had built, it was nothing more\r\nthan an assemblage of large towers, communicating with each other by\r\ngalleries. In 1383, Charles VI made it his residence. In 1431,\r\nCharles VII relinquished it to the Parliament of Paris. However,\r\nFrancis I. took up his abode here for some time.\r\n\r\nIt was in the great hall of this palace that the kings of France\r\nformerly received ambassadors, and gave public entertainments.\r\n\r\nOn Whitsunday, 1313, Philip the Fair here knighted his three sons,\r\nwith all the ceremonies of ancient chivalry. The king of England, our\r\nunfortunate Edward II, and his abominable queen Isabella, who were\r\ninvited, crossed the sea on purpose, and were present at this\r\nentertainment, together with a great number of English barons. It\r\nlasted eight days, and is spoken of, by historians, as a most\r\nsumptuous banquet.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent hall, as well as great part of the palace, being\r\nreduced to ashes in 1618, it was rebuilt, in its present state, under\r\nthe direction of that skilful architect, JACQUES DE BROSSES. It is\r\nboth spacious and majestic, and is the only hall of the kind in\r\nFrance: the arches and arcades which support it are of hewn stone.\r\n\r\nAnother fire, which happened in 1776, consumed all the part extending\r\nfrom the gallery of prisoners to the _Sainte Chapelle_, founded by\r\nSt. Lewis, and where, before the revolution, were shewn a number of\r\ncostly relics. The ravages occasioned by this fire, were repaired in\r\n1787, and the space in front laid open by the erection of uniform\r\nbuildings in the form of a crescent. To two gloomy gothic gates has\r\nbeen substituted an iron railing, of one hundred and twenty feet in\r\nextent, through which is seen a spacious court formed by two wings of\r\nnew edifices, and a majestic façade that affords an entrance to the\r\ninterior of the palace.\r\n\r\nIn this court Madame La Motte, who, in 1786, made so conspicuous a\r\nfigure in the noted affair of the diamond necklace, was publicly\r\nwhipped. I was in Paris at the time, though not present at the\r\nexecution of the sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the railing, are three gates, the centre one of which is charged\r\nwith garlands and other gilt ornaments. At the two ends are pavilions\r\ndecorated with four Doric pillars. Towards the _Pont St. Michel_ is a\r\ncontinuation of the building ornamented with a bas-relief, at present\r\ndenominated _Le serment civique_.\r\n\r\nAt the top of a flight of steps, is an avant-corps, with four Doric\r\ncolumns, a balustrade above the entablature, four statues standing on\r\na level with the base of the pillars, and behind, a square dome.\r\n\r\nThese steps lead you to the _Mercière_ gallery, having on the one\r\nside, the _Sainte Chapelle_, and on the other, the great hall, called\r\nthe _Salle des Procureurs_. In this extensive hall are shops, for the\r\nsale of eatables and pamphlets, which, since the suppression of the\r\nParliament, seem to have little custom, as well as those of the\r\nmilliners, &c. in the other galleries.\r\n\r\nIn what was formerly called the _grande chambre_, where the\r\nParliament of Paris used to sit, the ill-fated Lewis XVI, in 1788,\r\nheld the famous bed of justice, in which D'ESPRESMENIL, one of the\r\nmembers of that body, struck the first blow at royalty; a blow that\r\nwas revenged by a _lettre de cachet_, which exiled him to the _Ile de\r\nSt. Marguerite_, famous for being the place of confinement of the\r\ngreat personage who was always compelled to wear an _iron mask_. The\r\ncourage of this counsellor, who was a noble and deputy of the\r\n_noblesse_, may be considered as the _primum mobile_ of the\r\nrevolution. Under the despotism of the court, he braved all its\r\nvengeance; but, in the sequel, he afforded a singular proof of the\r\ninstability of the human mind. After haying stirred up all the\r\nparliaments against the royal authority, he again became the humble\r\nservant of the crown.\r\n\r\nAfter the revolution, the _Palais de Justice_ became the seat of the\r\nRevolutionary Tribunal, where the satellites of Robespierre, not\r\ncontent with sending to the scaffold sixty victims at a time,\r\ncomplained of the insufficiency of their means for bringing to trial\r\nall the enemies of liberty. Dumas, at one time president of this\r\nsanguinary tribunal, proposed to his colleagues to join to the hall,\r\nwhere the tribunal sat, part of the great hall of the palace, in\r\norder to assemble there five or six hundred victims at a time; and on\r\nits being observed to him that such a sight might in the end disgust\r\nthe people; \"Well,\" said he, \"there's but one method of accomplishing\r\nour object, without any obstacle, that is to erect a guillotine in\r\nthe court-yard of every prison, and cause the prisoners to be\r\nexecuted there during the night.\" Had not Robespierre's downfall\r\ninvolved that of all his blood-thirsty dependents, there seems no\r\ndoubt that this plan would have been carried into speedy execution.\r\n\r\nNothing can paint the vicissitude of human events in colours more\r\nstriking than the transitions of this critical period. Dumas who made\r\nthis proposal, and had partially satisfied his merciless disposition\r\nby signing, a few hours before, the death-warrant of sixty victims,\r\nwas the very next day brought before the same tribunal, composed of\r\nhis accomplices, or rather his creatures, and by them condemned to\r\ndie. Thus did experience confirm the general observation, that the\r\nmultiplicity and enormity of punishments announces an approaching\r\nrevolution. The torrents of blood which tyrants shed, are, in the\r\nend, swelled by their own.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a tribunal of blood, the _Palais de Justice_ is now\r\nappropriated to the sittings of the three tribunals, designated by\r\nthe following titles: _Tribunal de cassation_, _Tribunal d'appel_,\r\nand _Tribunal de première instance_. The first of these, the\r\n_Tribunal de cassation_, occupies the audience-chambers of the late\r\nparliament; while the _grande chambre_ is appointed for the meetings\r\nof its united Sections. The decoration of this spacious apartment is\r\nentirely changed: it is embellished in the antique style; and a\r\nperson in contemplating it might fancy himself at Athens.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to the _Palais de Justice_, is the famous prison, so\r\ndreaded in the early periods of the revolution, called\r\n\r\nLA CONCIERGERIE.\r\n\r\nFrom this fatal abode, neither talent, virtue, nor patriotism could,\r\nat one time, secure those who possessed such enviable qualities.\r\nLavoisier, Malsherbes, Condorcet, &c. were here successively immured,\r\npreviously to being sent to the guillotine. Here too the unfortunate\r\nMarie-Antoinette lived in a comfortless manner, from the 2nd of July,\r\n1793, to the 13th of October following, the period of her\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nOn being reconducted to the prison, at four o'clock in the morning,\r\nafter hearing her sentence read, the hapless queen displayed a\r\nfortitude worthy of the daughter of the high-minded Maria Theresa.\r\nShe requested a few hours' respite, to compose her mind, and\r\nentreated to be left to herself in the room which she had till then\r\noccupied. The moment she was alone, she first cut off her hair, and\r\nthen laying aside her widow's weeds, which she had always worn since\r\nthe death of the king, put on a white dress, and threw herself on her\r\nbed, where she slept till eleven o'clock the same morning, when she\r\nwas awakened, in order to be taken to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nContinuing to cross the _Ile du Palais_ in a direction towards the\r\nsouth, we presently reach the\r\n\r\nPONT ST. MICHEL.\r\n\r\nThis bridge stands in a direct line with the _Pont au Change_, and is\r\nsituated on the south channel of the river. It was formerly of wood:\r\nbut having been frequently destroyed, it was rebuilt with stone in\r\n1618, and covered on both sides with houses. From the _Pont Neuf_,\r\nthe back of these buildings has a most disagreeable and filthy\r\nappearance. It is said that they are to be taken down, as those have\r\nbeen which stood on the other bridges.\r\n\r\nIn severe winters, when there is much ice in the river, it is\r\ncurious, on the breaking up of the frost, to behold families\r\ndeserting their habitations, like so many rats, and carrying with\r\nthem their valuables, from the apprehension that these crazy\r\ntenements might fall into the river. This wise precaution is\r\nsuggested by the knowledge of these bridges, when built of wood,\r\nhaving been often swept away by ice or great inundations.\r\n\r\nThe _Pont St. Michel_ consists of four arches. Its length is two\r\nhundred and sixty-eight feet, by sixty in breadth, including the\r\nhouses, between which is a passage for three carriages.\r\n\r\nIf, to avoid being entangled in narrow, dirty streets, we return, by\r\nthe same route, to the north bank of the Seine, and proceed to the\r\nwestward, along the _Quai de Gévres_, which is partly built on piles,\r\ndriven into the bed of the river, we shall come to the\r\n\r\nPONT NOTRE-DAME.\r\n\r\nA wooden bridge, which previously existed here, having been\r\nfrequently carried away by inundations, Lewis XII ordered the\r\nconstruction of the present one of stone, which was begun in 1499,\r\nand completed in 1507. It was built from the plan of one JOCONDE, a\r\nCordelier, and native of Verona, and is generally admired for the\r\nsolidity, as well as beauty of its architecture. It consists of six\r\narches, and is two hundred and seventy-six feet in length. Formerly\r\nit was bordered by houses, which were taken down in 1786: this has\r\nrendered the quarter more airy, and consequently more salubrious.\r\n\r\nIt was on this bridge that the Pope's Legate reviewed the\r\necclesiastical infantry of the League, on the the 3d of June, 1590.\r\nCapuchins, Minimes, Cordeliers, Jacobins or Dominicans, Feuillans,\r\n&c. all with their robe tucked up, their cowl thrown behind, a helmet\r\non their head, a coat of mail on their body, a sword by their side,\r\nand a musquet on their shoulder, marched four by four, headed by the\r\nreverend bishop of Senlis, bearing a spontoon. But some of this holy\r\nsoldiery, forgetting that their pieces were loaded with ball, wished\r\nto salute the Legate, and killed by his side one of his chaplains.\r\nHis Eminence finding that it began to grow hot at this review,\r\nhastened to give his benediction, and vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 18, in continuation_.\r\n\r\nTraversing once more two-thirds of the _Ile du Palais_ in a direction\r\nfrom north to south, and then striking off to the east, up the _Rue\r\nde Callandre_, we reach the\r\n\r\nCATHEDRAL OF NOTRE-DAME.\r\n\r\nThis church, the first ever built in Paris, was begun about the year\r\n375, under the reign of the emperor Valentinian I. It was then called\r\n_St. Etienne_ or _St. Stephen's_, and there was as yet no other\r\nwithin the walls of this city in 1522, when Childebert, son of\r\nClovis, repaired and enlarged it, adding to it a new basilic, which\r\nwas dedicated to _Notre Dame_ or Our Lady.\r\n\r\nMore anciently, under Tiberius, there had been, on the same spot, an\r\naltar in the open air, dedicated to Jupiter and other pagan gods,\r\npart of which is still in being at the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS, in\r\nthe _Rue des Petits Augustins_.\r\n\r\nThese two churches existed till about the year 1160, under the reign\r\nof Lewis the Young, when the construction of the present cathedral\r\nwas begun partly on their foundations. It was not finished till 1185,\r\nduring the reign of Philip Augustus.\r\n\r\nThis Gothic Church is one of the handsomest and most spacious in\r\nFrance. It has a majestic and venerable appearance, and is supported\r\nby one hundred and twenty clustered columns. Its length is three\r\nhundred and ninety feet by one hundred and forty-four in breadth, and\r\none hundred and two in height.\r\n\r\nWe must not expect to find standing here the twenty-six kings,\r\nbenefactors of this church, from Childeric I to Philip Augustus,\r\nfourteen feet high, who figured on the same line, above the three\r\ndoors of the principal façade. They have all fallen under the blows\r\nof the iconoclasts, and are now piled up behind the church. There lie\r\nround-bellied Charlemagne, with his pipe in his mouth, and Pepin the\r\nShort, with his sword in his hand, and a lion, the emblem of courage,\r\nunder his feet. The latter, like Tydeus, mentioned in the Iliad,\r\nthough small in stature, was stout in heart, as appears from the\r\nfollowing anecdote related of him by the monk of St. Gal.\r\n\r\nIn former times, as is well known, kings took a delight in setting\r\nwild beasts and ferocious animals to fight against each other. At one\r\nof thege fights, between a lion and a bull, in the abbey of\r\nFerrières, Pepin the Short, who knew that some noblemen were daily\r\nexercising their pleasantry on his small stature, addressed to them\r\nthis question: \"Which of you feels himself bold enough to kill or\r\nseparate those terrible animals?\" Seeing that not one of them stepped\r\nforward, and that the proposal alone made them shudder: \"Well,\" added\r\nhe, \"'tis I then who will perform the feat.\" He accordingly descended\r\nfrom his place, drew his sword, killed the lion, at another stroke\r\ncut off the head of the bull, and then looking fiercely at the\r\nrailers: \"Know,\" said he to them, \"that stature adds nothing to\r\ncourage, and that I shall find means to bring to the ground the proud\r\npersons who shall dare to despise me, as little David laid low the\r\ngreat giant Goliah.\" Hence the attribute given to the statue of king\r\nPepin, which not long since adorned the façade of _Notre-Dame_.\r\n\r\nThe groups of angels, saints, and patriarchs, which, no doubt, owe\r\ntheir present existence only to their great number, still present to\r\nthe eye of the observer that burlesque mixture of the profane and\r\nreligious, so common in the symbolical representations of the twelfth\r\ncentury. These figures adorn the triple row of indented borders of\r\nthe arches of the three doors.\r\n\r\nTwo enormous square towers, each two hundred and two feet in height,\r\nand terminated by a platform, decorate each end of the cathedral. The\r\nascent to them is by a winding staircase of three hundred and\r\neighty-nine steps, and their communication is by a gallery which\r\nhas no support but Gothic pillars of a lightness that excites\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the six bells, which have disappeared with the\r\nlittle belfry that contained them, in the two towers were ten, one of\r\nwhich weighed forty-four thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the north tower is the rural calendar or zodiac, which\r\nhas been described by M. Le Gentil, member of the Academy of\r\nSciences. The Goths had borrowed from the Indians this custom of thus\r\nrepresenting rustic labours at the entrance of their temples.\r\n\r\nAnother Gothic bas-relief, which is seen on the left, in entering by\r\nthe great door, undoubtedly represents that condemned soul who,\r\ntradition says, rose from his bier, during divine service, in order\r\nto pronounce his own damnation.\r\n\r\nNone of the forty-five chapels have preserved the smallest vestige of\r\ntheir ornaments. Those which escaped the destructive rage of the\r\nmodern Vandals, have been transported to the MUSEUM OF FRENCH\r\nMONUMENTS. The most remarkable are the statue of Pierre de Gondi,\r\narchbishop of Paris, the mausoleum of the Conte d'Harcourt, designed\r\nby his widow, the modern Artemisia, and executed by Pigalle, together\r\nwith the group representing the vow of St. Lewis, by Costou the\r\nelder. Six angels in bronze, which were seen at the further end of\r\nthe choir, have also been removed thither.\r\n\r\nThe stalls present, in square and oval compartments, bas-reliefs very\r\ndelicately sculptured, representing subjects taken from the life of\r\nthe Holy Virgin and from the New Testament. Of the two episcopal\r\npulpits, which are at the further end, the one, that of the\r\narchbishop, represents the martyrdom of St. Denis; the other,\r\nopposite, the cure of king Childebert, by the intercession of St.\r\nGermain.\r\n\r\nSome old tapestry, hung scantily round the choir, makes one regret\r\nthe handsome iron railing, so richly wrought, by which it was\r\ninclosed, and some valuable pictures, which now figure in the grand\r\nGallery of the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS.\r\n\r\nThe nave, quite as naked as the choir and the sanctuary, had been\r\nenriched, as far as the space would admit, with pictures, twelve feet\r\nhigh, given for a long time, on every first of May, by the\r\nGoldsmiths' company and the fraternity of St. Anne and St. Marcel.\r\n\r\nOn the last pillar of the nave, on the right, was the equestrian\r\nstatue of Philip of Valois. That king was here represented on\r\nhorseback, with his vizor down, sword in hand, and armed cap-à-pié,\r\nin the very manner in which he rode into the cathedral of\r\n_Notre-Dame_, in 1328, after the battle of Cassel. At the foot of\r\nthe altar he left his horse, together with his armour, which he had\r\nworn in the battle, as an offering to the Holy Virgin, after having\r\nreturned thanks to God and to her, say historians, for the victory\r\nhe had obtained through her intercession.\r\n\r\nAbove the lateral alleys, as well of the choir as of the nave, are\r\nlarge galleries, separated by little pillars of a single piece, and\r\nbordered by iron balustrades. Here spectators place themselves to see\r\ngrand ceremonies. From their balconies were formerly suspended the\r\ncolours taken from the enemy: these are now displayed in the _Temple\r\nof Mars_ at the HÔTEL DES INVALIDES.\r\n\r\nThe organ, which appears to have suffered no injury, is reckoned one\r\nof the loudest and most complete in France. It is related that\r\nDaquin, an incomparable organist, who died in 1781, once imitated the\r\nnightingale on it so perfectly, that the beadle was sent on the roof\r\nof the church, to endeavour to discover the musical bird.\r\n\r\nSome of the stained glass is beautiful. Two roses, restored to their\r\noriginal state, the one on the side of the archipiscopal palace in\r\n1726, and the other above the organ, in 1780, prove by their lustre,\r\nthat the moderns are not so inferior to the ancients, in the art of\r\npainting on glass, as is commonly imagined.\r\n\r\nShould your curiosity lead you to contemplate the house of Fulbert,\r\nthe canon, the supposed uncle to the tender Héloïse, where that\r\ncelebrated woman passed her youthful days, you must enter, by the\r\ncloister of _Notre-Dame_, into the street that leads to the _Pont\r\nRouge_, since removed. It is the last house on the right under the\r\narcade, and is easily distinguished by two medallions in stone,\r\npreserved on the façade, though it has been several times rebuilt\r\nduring the space of six hundred years. All the authors who have\r\nwritten on the antiquities of Paris, speak of these medallions as\r\nbeing real portraits of Abélard and Héloïse. It is presumable that\r\nthey were so originally; but, without being a connoisseur, any one\r\nmay discover that the dresses of these figures are far more modern\r\nthan those peculiar to the twelfth century; whence it may be\r\nconcluded that the original portraits having been destroyed by time,\r\nor by the alterations which the house has undergone, these busts have\r\nbeen executed by some more modern sculptor of no great talents.\r\n\r\nLeaving the cathedral, by the _Rue Notre-Dame_, and turning to the\r\nleft, on reaching the _Marché Palu_, we come to the\r\n\r\nPETIT PONT.\r\n\r\nLike the _Pont St. Michel_, this bridge is situated on the south\r\nchannel of the river, and stands in a direct line with the _Pont\r\nNotre-Dame_. It originally owed its construction to the following\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nFour Jews, accused of having killed one of their converted brethren,\r\nwere condemned to be publicly whipped through all the streets of the\r\ncity, on four successive Sundays. After having suffered the half of\r\ntheir sentence, to redeem themselves from the other half, they paid\r\n18,000 francs of gold. This sum was appropriated to the erection of\r\nthe _Petit Pont_, the first stone of which was laid by Charles VI, in\r\n1395.\r\n\r\nIn 1718, two barges, loaded with hay, caught fire, and being cut\r\nloose, drifted under the arches of this bridge, which, in the space\r\nof four hours, was consumed, together with the houses standing on it.\r\nThe following year it was rebuilt, but without houses.\r\n\r\nProceeding to the east, along the quays of the _Ile du Palais_, you\r\nwill find the\r\n\r\nPONT AU DOUBLE.\r\n\r\nThis little bridge, situated behind the _Hôtel-Dieu_, of which I\r\nshall speak hereafter, is destined for foot-passengers only, as was\r\nthe _Pont Rouge_. The latter was the point of communication between\r\nthe _Cité_ and the _Ile St. Louis_; but the frequent reparations\r\nwhich it required, occasioned it to be removed in 1791, though, by\r\nthe Plan of Paris, it still appears to be in existence. However, it\r\nis in contemplation to replace it by another of stone.[1]\r\n\r\nSupposing that you have regained the north bank of the Seine, by\r\nmeans of the _Pont Notre-Dame_, you follow the quays, which skirt\r\nthat shore, till you reach the\r\n\r\nPONT MARIE.\r\n\r\nThis bridge forms a communication between the _Port St. Paul_ and the\r\n_Ile St. Louis_. The _Pont Marie_ was named after the engineer who\r\nengaged with Henry IV to build it; but that prince having been\r\nassassinated; the young king, Lewis XIII, and the queen dowager, laid\r\nthe first stone in 1614: it was finished, and bordered with houses,\r\nin 1635. It consists of five arches. Its length is three hundred feet\r\nby sixty-two in breadth. An inundation having carried away two of the\r\narches, in 1658, they were repaired without the addition of houses,\r\nand in 1789, the others were removed.\r\n\r\nPassing through the _Rue des Deux Ponts_, which lies in a direct line\r\nwith the _Pont Marie_, we arrive at the\r\n\r\nPONT DE LA TOURNELLE.\r\n\r\nThis bridge takes its name from the _Château de la Tournelle_,\r\ncontiguous to the _Porte St. Bernard_, where the galley-slaves used\r\nformerly to be lodged, till they were sent off to the different\r\npublic works. It consists of six arches of solid construction, and is\r\nbordered on each side by a foot-pavement.\r\n\r\nYou are now acquainted with all the bridges in Paris; but should you\r\nprefer crossing the Seine in a boat, there are several ferries\r\nbetween the bridges, and at other convenient places. Here, you may\r\nalways meet with a waterman, who, for the sum of one _sou_, will\r\ncarry you over, whether master or lackey. Like the old ferryman\r\nCharon, he makes no distinction of persons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Workmen are, at this moment, employed in the\r\nconstruction of three new bridges. The first, already mentioned, will\r\nform a communication between the _ci-devant Collège des Quatre\r\nNations_ and the _Louvre_; the second, between the _Ile du Palais_\r\nand the _Ile St. Louis_; and the third, between the _Jardin des\r\nPlantes_ and the Arsenal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 20, 1801._\r\n\r\nWhat a charming abode is Paris, for a man who can afford to live at\r\nthe rate of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds a year! Pleasures\r\nwait not for him to go in quest of them; they come to him of their\r\nown accord; they spring up, in a manner, under his very feet, and\r\nform around him an officious retinue. Every moment of the day can\r\npresent a new gratification to him who knows how to enjoy it; and,\r\nwith prudent management, the longest life even would not easily\r\nexhaust so ample a stock.\r\n\r\nParis has long been termed an epitome of the world. But, perhaps,\r\nnever could this denomination be applied to it with so much propriety\r\nas at the present moment. The chances of war have not only rendered\r\nit the centre of the fine arts, the museum of the most celebrated\r\nmasterpieces in existence, the emporium where the luxury of Europe\r\ncomes to procure its superfluities; but the taste for pleasure has\r\nalso found means to assemble here all the enjoyments which Nature\r\nseemed to have exclusively appropriated to other climates.\r\n\r\nEvery country has its charms and advantages. Paris alone appears to\r\ncombine them all. Every region, every corner of the globe seems to\r\nvie in hastening to forward hither the tribute of its productions.\r\nAre you an epicure? No delicacy of the table but may be eaten in\r\nParis.--Are you a toper? No delicious wine but may be drunk, in\r\nParis.--Are you fond of frequenting places of public entertainment?\r\nNo sort of spectacle but may be seen in Paris.--Are you desirous of\r\nimproving your mind? No kind of instruction but may be acquired in\r\nParis.--Are you an admirer of the fair sex? No description of female\r\nbeauty but may be obtained in Paris.--Are you partial to the society\r\nof men of extraordinary talents? No great genius but comes to display\r\nhis knowledge in Paris.--Are you inclined to discuss military topics?\r\nNo hero but brings his laurels to Paris.--In a word, every person,\r\nfavoured by Nature or Fortune, flies to enjoy the gifts of either in\r\nParis. Even every place celebrated in the annals of voluptuousness,\r\nis, as it were, reproduced in Paris, which, in some shape or another,\r\npresents its name or image.\r\n\r\nWithout going out of this capital, you may, in the season when Nature\r\nputs on her verdant livery, visit _Idalium_, present your incense to\r\nthe Graces, and adore, in her temple, the queen of love; while at\r\n_Tivoli_, you may, perhaps, find as many beauties and charms as were\r\nformerly admired at the enchanting spot on the banks of the Anio,\r\nwhich, under its ancient name of _Tibur_, was so extolled by the\r\nLatin poets; and close to the Boulevard, at _Frascati_, you may, in\r\nthat gay season, eat ices as good as those with which Cardinal de\r\nBernis used to regale his visiters, at his charming villa in the\r\n_Campagna di Roma_. Who therefore need travel farther than Paris to\r\nenjoy every gratification?\r\n\r\nIf then, towards the close of a war, the most frightful and\r\ndestructive that ever was waged, the useful and agreeable seem to\r\nhave proceeded here hand in hand in improvement, what may not be\r\nexpected in the tranquillity of a few years' peace? Who knows but the\r\nemperor Julian's \"_dear Lutetia_\" may one day vie in splendour with\r\nThebes and its hundred gates, or ancient Rome covering its seven\r\nmountains?\r\n\r\nHowever, if _Tivoli_ and _Frascati_ throw open their delightful\r\nrecesses to the votaries of pleasure only in spring and summer, even\r\nnow, during the fogs of December, you may repair to\r\n\r\nPAPHOS.\r\n\r\nIt might almost be said that you enter this place of amusement\r\ngratis, for, though a slight tribute of seventy-five _centimes_\r\n(_circa_ seven-pence halfpenny sterling) is required for the\r\nadmission of every person, yet you may take refreshment to the amount\r\nof that sum, without again putting your hand into your pocket;\r\nbecause the counter mark, given at the door, is received at the bar\r\nas ready-money.\r\n\r\nThis speculation, the first of the kind in France, and one of the\r\nmost specious, is, by all accounts, also one of the most productive.\r\nIt would be too rigorous, no doubt, to compare the frequenters of the\r\nmodern PAPHOS to the inhabitants of the ancient. Here, indeed, you\r\nmust neither look for _élégantes_, nor _muscadins_; but you may view\r\nbelles, less gifted by Fortune, indulging in innocent recreation; and\r\nfor a while dispelling their cares, by dancing to the exhilarating\r\nmusic of an orchestra not ill composed. Here, the grisette banishes\r\nthe _ennui_ of six days' application to the labours of her industry,\r\nby footing it away on Sunday. Hither, in short, the less refined sons\r\nand daughters of mirth repair to see and be seen, and to partake of\r\nthe general diversion.\r\n\r\nPAPHOS is situated on that part of the Boulevard, called the\r\n_Boulevard du Temple_, whither I was led the other evening by that\r\nsort of curiosity, which can be satisfied only when the objects that\r\nafford it aliment are exhausted. I had just come out of another place\r\nof public amusement, at no great distance, called\r\n\r\nLA PHANTASMAGORIE.\r\n\r\nThis is an exhibition in the _Cour des Capucines_, adjoining to the\r\nBoulevard, where ROBERTSON, a skilful professor of physics, amuses or\r\nterrifies his audience by the appearance of spectres, phantoms, &c.\r\nIn the piece which I saw, called _Le Tombeau de Robespierre_, he\r\ncarries illusion to an extraordinary degree of refinement. His\r\ncabinet of physics is rich, and his effects of optics are managed in\r\nthe true style of French gallantry. His experiments of galvanism\r\nexcite admiration. He repeats the difficult ones of M. VOLTA, and\r\nclearly demonstrates the electrical phenomena presented by the\r\nmetallic pile. A hundred disks of silver and a hundred pieces of zinc\r\nare sufficient for him to produce attractions, sparks, the divergency\r\nof the electrometer, and electric hail. He charges a hundred Leyden\r\nbottles by the simple contact of the metallic pile. ROBERTSON, I\r\nunderstand, is the first who has made these experiments in Paris, and\r\nhas succeeded in discharging VOLTA's pistol by the galvanic spark.\r\n\r\nFITZJAMES, a famous ventriloquist, entertains and astonishes the\r\ncompany by a display of his powers, which are truly surprising.\r\n\r\nYou may, perhaps, be desirous to procure your family circle the\r\nsatisfaction of enjoying the _Phantasmagoria_, though not on the\r\ngrand scale on which it is exhibited by ROBERTSON. By the\r\ncommunication of a friend, I am happy in being enabled to make you\r\nmaster of the secret, as nothing can be more useful in the education\r\nof children than to banish from their mind the deceitful illusion of\r\nghosts and hobgoblins, which they are so apt to imbibe from their\r\nnurses. But to the point--\"You have,\" says my author, \"only to call\r\nin the first itinerant foreigner, who perambulates the streets with a\r\n_galantee-show_ (as it is commonly termed in London), and by\r\nimparting to him your wish, if he is not deficient in intelligence\r\nand skill, he will soon be able to give you a rehearsal of the\r\napparition of phantoms: for, by approaching or withdrawing the stand\r\nof his show, and finding the focus of his glasses, you will see the\r\nobjects diminish or enlarge either on the white wall, or the sheet\r\nthat is extended.\r\n\r\n\"The illusion which leads us to imagine that an object which\r\nincreases in all its parts, is advancing towards us, is the basis of\r\nthe _Phantasmagoria_, and, in order to produce it with the\r\n_galantee-show_, you have only to withdraw slowly the lantern from\r\nthe place on which the image is represented, by approaching the outer\r\nlens to that on which the object is traced: this is easily done, that\r\nglass being fixed in a moveable tube like that of an opera-glass.\r\nAs for approaching the lantern gradually, it may be effected with the\r\nsame facility, by placing it on a little table with castors, and, by\r\nmeans of a very simple mechanism, it is evident that both these\r\nmovements may be executed together in suitable progression.\r\n\r\n\"The deception recurred to by phantasmagorists is further increased\r\nby the mystery that conceals, from the eyes of the public, their\r\noperations and optical instruments: but it is easy for the showman to\r\nsnatch from them this superiority, and to strengthen the illusion for\r\nthe children whom you choose to amuse with this sight. For that\r\npurpose, he has only to change the arrangement of the sheet, by\r\nrequiring it to be suspended from the ceiling, between him and the\r\nspectators, much in the same manner as the curtain of a playhouse,\r\nwhich separates the stage from the public. The transparency of the\r\ncloth shews through it the coloured rays, and, provided it be not of\r\ntoo thick and too close a texture, the image presents itself as clear\r\non the one side as on the other.\r\n\r\n\"If to these easy means you could unite those employed by ROBERTSON,\r\nsuch as the black hangings, which absorb the coloured rays, the\r\nlittle musical preparations, and others, you might transform all the\r\n_galantee-shows_ into as many _phantasmagorias_, in spite of the\r\npriority of invention, which belongs, conscientiously, to Father\r\nKIRCHER, a German Jesuit, who first found means to apply his\r\nknowledge respecting light to the construction of the magic lantern.\r\n\r\n\"The coloured figures, exhibited by the phatasmagorists, have no\r\nrelation to these effects of light: they are effigies covered with\r\ngold-beater's skin, or any other transparent substance, in which is\r\nplaced a dark lantern. The light of this lantern is extinguished or\r\nconcealed by pulling a string, or touching a spring, at the moment\r\nwhen any one wishes to seize on the figure, which, by this\r\ncontrivance, seems to disappear.\r\n\r\n\"The proprietors of the grand exhibitions of _phantasmagoria_ join to\r\nthese simple means a combination of different effects, which they\r\npartly derive from the phenomena, presented by the _camera obscura_.\r\nSome faint idea of that part of physics, called optics, which NEWTON\r\nilluminated, by his genius and experience, are sufficient for\r\nconceiving the manner in which these appearances are produced, though\r\nthey require instruments and particular care to give them proper\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the elucidation given of the _phantasmagoria_ by an\r\nintelligent observer, whose friend favoured me with this\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 21, 1801._\r\n\r\nIf Paris affords a thousand enjoyments to the man of fortune, it may\r\ntruly be said that, without money, Paris is the most melancholy abode\r\nin the world. Privations are then the more painful, because desires\r\nand even wants are rendered more poignant by the ostentatious display\r\nof every object which might satisfy them. What more cruel for an\r\nunfortunate fellow, with an empty purse, than to pass by the kitchen\r\nof a _restaurateur_, when, pinched by hunger, he has not the means of\r\nprocuring himself a dinner? His olfactory nerves being still more\r\nreadily affected when his stomach is empty, far from affording him a\r\npleasing sensation, then serve only to sharpen the torment which he\r\nsuffers. It is worse than the punishment of Tantalus, who, dying with\r\nthirst, could not drink, though up to his chin in water.\r\n\r\nReally, my dear friend, I would advise every rich epicure to fix his\r\nresidence in this city. Without being plagued by the details of\r\nhousekeeping, or even at the trouble of looking at a bill of fare, he\r\nmight feast his eye, and his appetite too, on the inviting plumpness\r\nof a turkey, stuffed with truffles. A boar's head set before him,\r\nwith a Seville orange between its tusks, might make him fancy that he\r\nwas discussing the greatest interests of mankind at the table of an\r\nAustrian Prime Minister, or British Secretary of State; while _pâtés_\r\nof _Chartres_ or of _Périgord_ hold out to his discriminating palate\r\nall the refinements of French seasoning. These, and an endless\r\nvariety of other dainties, no less tempting, might he contemplate\r\nhere, in walking past a _magazin de comestibles_ or\r\nprovision-warehouse.\r\n\r\nAmong the changes introduced here, within these few years, I had\r\nheard much of the improvements in the culinary art, or rather in the\r\nmanner of serving up its productions; but, on my first arrival in\r\nParis, I was so constantly engaged in a succession of dinner-parties,\r\nthat some time elapsed before I could avail myself of an opportunity\r\nof dining at the house of any of the fashionable\r\n\r\nRESTAURATEURS.\r\n\r\nThis is a title of no very ancient date in Paris. _Traiteurs_ have\r\nlong existed here: independently of furnishing repasts at home, these\r\n_traiteurs_, like Birch in Cornhill, or any other famous London cook,\r\nsent out dinners and suppers. But, in 1765, one BOULANGER conceived\r\nthe idea of _restoring_ the exhausted animal functions of the\r\ndebilitated Parisians by rich soups of various denominations. Not\r\nbeing a _traiteur_, it appears that he was not authorized to serve\r\nragouts; he therefore, in addition to his _restorative_ soups, set\r\nbefore his customers new-laid eggs and boiled fowl with strong gravy\r\nsauce: those articles were served up without a cloth, on little\r\nmarble tables. Over his door he placed the following inscription,\r\nborrowed from Scripture: \"_Venite ad me omnes qui stomacho laboratis,\r\net ego restaurabo vos._\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of the word and profession of _restaurateur_.\r\n\r\nOther cooks, in imitation of BOULANGER, set up as _restorers_, on a\r\nsimilar plan, in all the places of public entertainment where such\r\nestablishments were admissible. Novelty, fashion, and, above all,\r\ndearness, brought them into vogue. Many a person who would have been\r\nashamed to be seen going into a _traiteur's_, made no hesitation of\r\nentering a _restaurateur's_, where he paid nearly double the price\r\nfor a dinner of the same description. However, as, in all trades, it\r\nis the great number of customers that enrich the trader, rather than\r\nthe select few, the _restaurateurs_, in order to make their business\r\nanswer, were soon under the necessity of constituting themselves\r\n_traiteurs_; so that, in lieu of one title, they now possess two; and\r\nthis is the grand result of the primitive establishment.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the most noted _restaurateurs_ in Paris, previously to\r\nthe revolution, was LA BARRIÈRE in the _ci-devant Palais Royal_; but,\r\nthough his larder was always provided with choice food, his cellar\r\nfurnished with good wines, his bill of fare long, and the number of\r\nhis customers considerable, yet his profits, he said, were not\r\nsufficiently great to allow him to cover his tables with linen. This\r\nomission was supplied by green wax cloth; a piece of economy which,\r\nhe declared, produced him a saving of near 10,000 livres (_circa_\r\n400£ sterling) per annum in the single article of washing. Hence you\r\nmay form an idea of the extent of such an undertaking. I have often\r\ndined at LA BARRIÈRE'S was always well served, at a moderate charge,\r\nand with remarkable expedition. Much about that time, BEAUVILLIERS,\r\nwho had opened, within the same precincts, a similar establishment,\r\nbut on a more refined plan, proved a most formidable rival to LA\r\nBARRIÈRE, and at length eclipsed him.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of almost eleven years, I again find this identical\r\nBEAUVILLIERS still in the full enjoyment of the greatest celebrity.\r\nROBERT and NAUDET in the _Palais du Tribunat_, and VÉRY on the\r\n_Terrace des Feuillant_ dispute with him the palm in the art of\r\nApicius. All these, it is true, furnish excellent repasts, and their\r\nwines are not inferior to their cooking: but, after more than one\r\nimpartial trial, I think I am justified in giving the preference to\r\nBEAUVILLIERS. Let us then take a view of his arrangements: this, with\r\na few variations in price or quality, will serve as a general picture\r\nof the _ars coquinaria_ in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor of a large hotel, formerly occupied, perhaps, by a\r\nfarmer-general, you enter a suite of apartments, decorated with\r\narabesques, and mirrors of large dimensions, in a style no less\r\nelegant than splendid, where tables are completely arranged for large\r\nor small parties. In winter, these rooms are warmed by ornamental\r\nstoves, and lighted by _quinquets_, a species of Argand's lamps. They\r\nare capable of accommodating from two hundred and fifty to three\r\nhundred persons, and, at this time of the year, the average number\r\nthat dine here daily is about two hundred; in summer, it is\r\nconsiderably decreased by the attractions of the country, and the\r\nparties of pleasure made, in consequence, to the environs of the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand, as you pass into the first room, rises a sort of\r\nthrone, not unlike the _estrado_ in the grand audience-chamber of a\r\nSpanish viceroy. This throne is encircled by a barrier to keep\r\nintruders at a respectful distance. Here sits a lady, who, from her\r\nmajestic gravity and dignified bulk, you might very naturally suppose\r\nto be an empress, revolving in her comprehensive mind the affairs of\r\nher vast dominions. This respectable personage is Madame\r\nBEAUVILLIERS, whose most interesting concern is to collect from the\r\ngentlemen in waiting the cash which they receive at the different\r\ntables. In this important branch, she has the assistance of a lady,\r\nsomewhat younger than herself, who, seated by her side, in stately\r\nsilence, has every appearance of a maid of honour. A person in\r\nwaiting near the throne, from his vacant look and obsequious\r\ncarriage, might, at first sight, be taken for a chamberlain; whereas\r\nhis real office, by no means an unimportant one, is to distribute\r\ninto deserts the fruit and other _et ceteras_, piled up within his\r\nreach in tempting profusion.\r\n\r\nWe will take our seats in this corner, whence, without laying down\r\nour knife and fork, we can enjoy a full view of the company as they\r\nenter. We are rather early: by the clock, I perceive that it is no\r\nmore than five: at six, however, there will scarcely be a vacant seat\r\nat any of the tables. \"_Garçon, la carte_!\"--\"_La voilà devant vous,\r\nMonsieur._\"\r\n\r\nGood heaven! the bill of fare is a printed sheet of double _folio_,\r\nof the size of an English newspaper. It will require half an hour at\r\nleast to con over this important catalogue. Let us see; Soups,\r\nthirteen sorts.--_Hors-d'oeuvres_, twenty-two species.--Beef, dressed\r\nin eleven different ways.--Pastry, containing fish, flesh and fowl,\r\nin eleven shapes. Poultry and game, under thirty-two various forms.\r\n--Veal, amplified into twenty-two distinct articles.--Mutton, confined\r\nto seventeen only.--Fish, twenty-three varieties.--Roast meat, game,\r\nand poultry, of fifteen kinds.--Entremets, or side-dishes, to the\r\nnumber of forty-one articles.--Desert, thirty-nine.--Wines, including\r\nthose of the liqueur kind, of fifty-two denominations, besides ale\r\nand porter.--Liqueurs, twelve species, together with coffee and ices.\r\n\r\nFudge! fudge! you cry--Pardon me, my good friend, 'tis no fudge. Take\r\nthe tremendous bill of fare into your own hand. _Vide et lege_. As we\r\nare in no particular hurry, travel article by article through the\r\nwhole enumeration. This will afford you the most complete notion of\r\nthe expense of dining at a fashionable _restaurateur's_ in Paris.\r\n\r\nBEAUVILLIERS, RESTAURATEUR\r\n\r\n_Anciennement à la grande Tavernede la

have made up\r\nyour mind as to what you wish to have for dinner, you have it in your\r\npower, before you give the order, to ascertain the expense. But,\r\nthough you see the price of each dish, you see not the dish itself;\r\nand when it comes on the table, you may, perhaps, be astonished to\r\nfind that a pompous, big-sounding name sometimes produces only a\r\nscrap of scarcely three mouthfuls. It is the mountain in labour\r\ndelivered of a mouse.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are not a man of extraordinary appetite, you may, for\r\nthe sum of nine or ten francs, appease your hunger, drink your bottle\r\nof Champagne or Burgundy, and, besides, assist digestion by a dish of\r\ncoffee and a glass of liqueur. Should you like to partake of two\r\ndifferent sorts of wine, you may order them, and drink at pleasure of\r\nboth; if you do not reduce the contents below the moiety, you pay\r\nonly for the half bottle. A necessary piece of advice to you as a\r\nstranger, is, that, while you are dispatching your first dish, you\r\nshould take care to order your second, and so on in progression to\r\nthe end of the chapter: otherwise, for want of this precaution, when\r\nthe company is very numerous, you may, probably, have to wait some\r\nlittle time between the acts, before you are served.\r\n\r\nThis is no trifling consideration, if you purpose, after dinner, to\r\nvisit one of the principal theatres: for, if a new or favourite piece\r\nbe announced, the house is full, long before the raising of the\r\ncurtain; and you not only find no room at the theatre to which you\r\nfirst repair; but, in all probability, this disappointment will\r\nfollow you to every other for that evening.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, ten or fifteen minutes are sufficient for the most\r\ndainty or troublesome dish to undergo its final preparation, and in\r\nthat time you will have it smoking on the table. Those which admit of\r\nbeing completely prepared beforehand, are in a constant state of\r\nreadiness, and require only to be set over the fire to be warmed.\r\nEach cook has a distinct branch to attend to in the kitchen, and the\r\ncall of a particular waiter to answer, as each waiter has a distinct\r\nnumber of tables, and the orders of particular guests to obey in the\r\ndining-rooms. In spite of the confused noise arising from the gabble\r\nof so many tongues, there being probably eighty or a hundred persons\r\ncalling for different articles, many of whom are hasty and impatient,\r\nsuch is the habitual good order observed, that seldom does any\r\nmistake occur; the louder the vociferations of the hungry guests, the\r\ngreater the diligence of the alert waiters. Should any article, when\r\nserved, happen not to suit your taste, it is taken back and changed\r\nwithout the slightest murmur.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the establishments of the fashionable\r\n_restaurateurs_ before the revolution, and those in vogue at the\r\npresent day, is, that their profession presenting many candidates for\r\npublic favour, they are under the continual necessity of employing\r\nevery resource of art to attract customers, and secure a continuance\r\nof them. The commodiousness and elegance of their rooms, the\r\nsavouriness of their cooking, the quality of their wines, the\r\npromptitude of their attendants, all are minutely criticized; and, if\r\nthey study their own interest, they must neglect nothing to flatter\r\nthe eyes and palate. In fact, how do they know that some of their\r\nepicurean guests may not have been of their own fraternity, and once\r\nfigured in a great French family as _chef de cuisine_?\r\n\r\nOf course, with all this increase of luxury, you must expect an\r\nincrease of expense: but if you do not now dine here at so reasonable\r\na rate as formerly, at least you are sumptuously served for your\r\nmoney. If you wish to dine frugally, there are numbers of\r\n_restaurateurs_, where you may be decently served with _potage_,\r\n_bouilli_, an _entrée_, an _entremet_, bread and desert, for the\r\nmoderate sum of from twenty-six to thirty _sous_. The addresses of\r\nthese cheap eating-houses, if they are not put into your hand in the\r\nstreet, will present themselves to your eye, at the corner of almost\r\nevery wall in Paris. Indeed, all things considered, I am of opinion\r\nthat the difference in the expense of a dinner at a _restaurateur's_\r\nat present, and what it was ten or eleven years ago, is not more than\r\nin the due proportion of the increased price of provisions,\r\nhouse-rent, and taxes.\r\n\r\nThe difference the most worthy of remark in these rendezvous of good\r\ncheer, unquestionably consists in the company who frequent them. In\r\nformer times, the dining-rooms of the fashionable _restaurateurs_\r\nwere chiefly resorted to by young men of good character and\r\nconnexions, just entering into life, superannuated officers and\r\nbatchelors in easy circumstances, foreigners on their travels, &c. At\r\nthis day, these are, in a great measure, succeeded by stock-jobbers,\r\ncontractors, fortunate speculators, and professed gamblers. In\r\ndefiance of the old proverb, \"_le ventre est le plus grand de tous\r\nnos ennemis,_\" guttling and guzzling is the rage of these upstarts.\r\nIt is by no means uncommon to see many of them begin their dinner by\r\nswallowing six or seven dozen of oysters and a bottle of white wine,\r\nby way of laying a foundation for a _potage en tortue_ and eight or\r\nten other rich dishes. Such are the modern parvenus, whose craving\r\nappetites, in eating and drinking, as in every thing else, are not\r\neasily satiated.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost superfluous to mention, that where rich rogues\r\nabound, luxurious courtesans are at no great distance, were it not\r\nfor the sake of remarking that the former often regale the latter at\r\nthe _restaurateurs_, especially at those houses which afford the\r\nconvenience of snug, little rooms, called _cabinets particuliers_.\r\nHere, two persons, who have any secret affairs to settle, enjoy all\r\npossible privacy; for even the waiter never has the imprudence to\r\nenter without being called. In these asylums, Love arranges under his\r\nlaws many individuals not suspected of sacrificing at the shrine of\r\nthat wonder-working deity. Prudes, whose virtue is the universal\r\nboast, and whose austerity drives thousands of beaux to despair,\r\nsometimes make themselves amends for the reserve which they are\r\nobliged to affect in public, by indulging in a private _tête-à-tête_\r\nin these mysterious recesses. In them too, young lovers frequently\r\ninterchange the first declarations of eternal affection; to them many\r\na husband owes the happiness of paternity; and without them the gay\r\nwife might, perhaps, be at a loss to deceive her jealous Argus, and\r\nfind an opportunity of lending an attentive ear to the rapturous\r\naddresses of her aspiring gallant.\r\n\r\nWhat establishment then can be more convenient than that of a\r\n_restaurateur_? But you would be mistaken, were you to look for\r\n_cabinets particuliers_ at every house of this denomination, Here, at\r\nBEAUVILLIERS', for instance, you will find no such accommodation,\r\nthough if you dislike dining in public, you may have a private room\r\nproportioned to the number of a respectable party: or, should you be\r\nsitting at home, and just before the hour of dinner, two or three\r\nfriends call in unexpectedly, if you wish to enjoy their company in a\r\nquiet, sociable manner, you have only to dispatch your _valet de\r\nplace_ to BEAUVILLIERS' or to the nearest _restaurateur_ of repute\r\nfor the bill of fare, and at the same time desire him to bring\r\ntable-linen, knives, silver forks, spoons, and all other necessary\r\nappurtenances. While he is laying the cloth, you fix on your dinner,\r\nand, in little more than a quarter of an hour, you have one or two\r\nelegant courses, dressed in a capital style, set out on the table. As\r\nfor wine, if you find it cheaper, you can procure that article from\r\nsome respectable wine-merchant in the neighbourhood. In order to save\r\ntrouble, many single persons, and even small families now scarcely\r\never cook at home; but either dine at a _restaurateur's_, or have\r\ntheir dinners constantly furnished from one of these sources of\r\nculinary perfection.\r\n\r\nBut, while I am relating to you the advantages of these\r\nestablishments, time flies apace: 'tis six o'clock.--If you are not\r\ndisposed to drink more wine, let us have some coffee and our bill.\r\nWhen you want to pay, you say: \"_Garçon, la carte payante!_\" The\r\nwaiter instantly flies to a person, appointed for that purpose, to\r\nwhom he dictates your reckoning. On consulting your stomach, should\r\nyou doubt what you have consumed, you have only to call in the aid of\r\nyour memory, and you will be perfectly satisfied that you have not\r\nbeen charged with a single article too much or too little.\r\n\r\nRemark that portly man, so respectful in his demeanour. It is\r\nBEAUVILLIERS, the master of the house: this is his most busy hour,\r\nand he will now make a tour to inquire at the different tables, if\r\nhis guests are all served according to their wishes. He will then,\r\nlike an able general, take a central station, whence he can command a\r\nview of all his dispositions. The person, apparently next in\r\nconsequence to himself, and who seems to have his mind absorbed in\r\nother objects, is the butler: his thoughts are, with the wine under\r\nhis care, in the cellar.\r\n\r\nObserve the cleanly attention of the waiters, neatly habited in\r\nclose-bodied vests, with white aprons before them: watch the\r\nquickness of their motions, and you will be convinced that no scouts\r\nof a camp could be more _on the alert_. An establishment, so\r\nextremely well conducted, excites admiration. Every spring of the\r\nmachine duly performs its office; and the regularity of the whole\r\nmight serve as a model for the administration of an extensive State.\r\nRepair then, ye modern Machiavels, to N° 1243, _Rue de la Loi_; and,\r\nwhile you are gratifying your palate, imbibe instruction from\r\nBEAUVILLIERS.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARIS\r\n\r\nAS IT WAS AND AS IT IS;\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nA Sketch of the French Capital,\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE OF\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF THE REVOLUTION,\r\n\r\nWITH RESPECT TO\r\n\r\nSCIENCES,\r\nLITERATURE,\r\nARTS,\r\nRELIGION,\r\nEDUCATION,\r\nMANNERS,\r\nAND\r\nAMUSEMENTS;\r\n\r\nCOMPRISING ALSO\r\n\r\nA correct Account of the most remarkable National Establishments and\r\nPublic Buildings.\r\n\r\nIn a Series of Letters,\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER,\r\n\r\nDURING THE YEARS 1801-2,\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIpsâ varietate tentamus efficere, ut alia aliis, quædem fortasse\r\nomnibus placeant.

And, in fact, what can be wanting to a species\r\nof instruction the object of which is to establish between the deaf\r\nand dumb, and the man who hears and speaks, a communication like that\r\nestablished between all men by the knowledge and practice of the same\r\nidiom; when the deaf and dumb man, by the help of the education given\r\nhim, succeeds in decomposing into phrases the longest period; into\r\nsimple propositions, the most complex phrase; into words, each\r\nproposition; into simple words, words the most complex: and when he\r\ndistinguishes perfectly words derived from primitives; figurative\r\nwords from proper ones; and when, after having thus decomposed the\r\nlongest discourse, he recomposes it; when, in short, the deaf and\r\ndumb man expresses all his ideas, all his thoughts, and all his\r\naffections; when he answers, like men the best-informed, all\r\nquestions put to him, respecting what he knows through the nature of\r\nhis intelligence, and respecting what he has learned, either from\r\nhimself or from him who has enlightened his understanding? What wish\r\nremains to be formed, when the deaf and dumb man is enabled to learn\r\nby himself a foreign language, when he translates it, and writes it,\r\nas well as those of whom it is the mother-tongue?\r\n\r\nSuch is the phenomenon which the Institution of the deaf and dumb\r\npresents to the astonishment of Europe, under the direction, or\r\nrather under the regeneration of the successor of the celebrated Abbé\r\nde l'Epée. His pupils realize every thing that I have just mentioned.\r\nThey write English and Italian as well as they do French. Nothing\r\nequals the justness and precision of their definitions.\r\n\r\nNor let it be imagined that they resemble birds repeating the tunes\r\nthey have learned. Never have they been taught the answer to a\r\nquestion. Their answers are always the effect of their good logic,\r\nand of the ideas of objects and of qualities of beings, acquired by a\r\nmind which the Institutor has formed from the great art of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThis institution was far short of its present state of perfection at\r\nthe death of the celebrated inventor, which happened on the 23d of\r\nDecember 1789. During the long career of their first father, the deaf\r\nand dumb had been able to find means only to write, under the\r\ndictation of signs, words whose import was scarcely known to them.\r\nWhen endeavours were made to make them emerge from the confined\r\nsphere of the first wants, not one of them knew how to express in\r\nwriting any thing but ideas of sense and wants of the first\r\nnecessity. The nature of the verb, the relations of tenses, that of\r\nother words comprehended in the phrase, and which form the syntax of\r\nlanguages, were utterly unknown to them. And, indeed, how could they\r\nanswer the most trifling question? Every thing in the construction of\r\na period was to them an enigma.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the successor of the inventor discovered the\r\ndefect of this instruction, which was purely mechanical and acquired\r\nby rote. He thought he perceived this defect in the _concrete_ verb,\r\nin which the deaf and dumb, seeing only a single word, were unable to\r\ndistinguish two ideas which are comprehended in it, that of\r\naffirmation and that of quality. He thought he perceived also that\r\ndefect in the expression of the qualities, always presented, in all\r\nlanguages, out of the subjects, and never in the noun which they\r\nmodify; and, by the help of a process no less simple than ingenious\r\nand profound, he has made the deaf and dumb comprehend the most\r\narduous difficulty, the nature of abstraction; he has initiated them\r\nin the art of generalizing ideas by presenting to them the adjective\r\nin the noun, as the quality is in the object, and the quality\r\nsubsisting alone and out of the object, having no support but in the\r\nmind, for him who considers it, and but in the abstract noun for him\r\nwho reads the expression of it. He has, in like manner, separated the\r\nverb from the quality in concrete verbs, and communicated to the deaf\r\nand dumb the knowledge of the true verb, which he has pointed out to\r\nthem in the termination of all the French verbs, by reattaching to\r\nthe subject, by a line agreed on, its verbal quality. This line he\r\nhas translated by the verb _to be_, the only verb recognized by\r\nphilosophic grammarians.\r\n\r\nThese are the two foundations of this very extraordinary source of\r\ninstruction, and on which all the rest depend. The pronouns are\r\nlearned by nouns; the tenses of conjugation, by the three absolute\r\ntenses of conjugation of all languages; and these, by this line, so\r\nhappily imagined, which is a sign of the present when it connects the\r\nverbal quality and the subject, a sign of the past when it is\r\nintersected, a sign of the future when it is only begun.\r\n\r\nAll the conjugations are reduced to a single one, as are all the\r\nverbs. The adverbs considered as adjectives, when they express the\r\nmanner, and as substitutes for a preposition and its government, when\r\nthey express time or place, &c. The preposition represented as a mean\r\nof transmitting the influence of the word which precedes it to that\r\nwhich follows it; the articles serving, as in the English language,\r\nto determine the extent of a common noun. Such is a summary of the\r\ngrammatical system of the Institutor of the deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nIt is the metaphysical part, above all, which, in this institution,\r\nis carried to such a degree of simplicity and clearness, that it is\r\nwithin reach of understandings the most limited. And, indeed, one\r\nought not to be astonished at the rapid progress of the deaf and dumb\r\nin the art of expressing their ideas and of communicating in writing\r\nwith every speaker, as persons absent communicate with each other by\r\nsimilar means. In the space of eighteen months, a pupil begins to\r\ngive an account in writing of the actions of which he is rendered a\r\nwitness, and, in the space of five years, his education is complete.\r\n\r\nThe objects in which the deaf and dumb are instructed, are Grammar,\r\nthe notions of Metaphysics and Logic, which the former renders\r\nnecessary, Religion, the Use of the Globes, Geography, Arithmetic,\r\ngeneral notions of History, ancient and modern, of Natural History,\r\nof Arts and Trades, &c.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunates, restored by communication to society, from which\r\nNature seemed to have intended to exclude them, are usefully\r\nemployed. One of their principal occupations is a knowledge of a\r\nmechanical art. Masters in the most ordinary arts are established in\r\nthe house of the deaf and dumb, and every one there finds employment\r\nin the art which best suits his inclination, his strength, and his\r\nnatural disposition. In this school, which is established at the\r\nextremity of the _Faubourg St. Jacques_, is a printing-office, where\r\nsome are employed as compositors; others, as pressmen. In a\r\npreparatory drawing-school they are taught the rudiments of painting,\r\nengraving, and Mosaic, for the last of which there are two workshops.\r\nThere is also a person to teach engraving on fine grained stones, as\r\nwell as a joiner, a tailor, and a shoemaker. The garden, which is\r\nlarge, is cultivated by the deaf and dumb. Almost every thing that is\r\nused by them is made by themselves. They make their own bedsteads,\r\nchairs, tables, benches, and clothes. The deaf and dumb females too\r\nmake their shirts, and the rest of their linen.\r\n\r\nThus their time is so taken up that, with the exception of three\r\nhours devoted to moral instruction, all the rest is employed in\r\nmanual labour.\r\n\r\nSuch is this establishment, where the heart is agreeably affected at\r\nthe admirable spectacle which presents at once every thing that does\r\nthe most honour to human intelligence, in the efforts which it has\r\nbeen necessary to make in order to overcome the obstacles opposed to\r\nits development by the privation of the sense the most useful, and\r\nthat of the faculty the most essential to the communication of men\r\nwith one another, and the sight of the physical power employed in\r\nseeking, in arts and trades, resources which render men independent.\r\n\r\nBut to what degree are these unfortunates deaf, and why are they\r\ndumb?\r\n\r\nIt is well known that they are dumb because they are deaf, and they\r\nare more or less deaf, when they are so only by accident, in\r\nproportion as the auditory nerve is more or less braced, or more or\r\nless relaxed. In various experiments made on sound, some have heard\r\nsharp sounds, and not grave ones; others, on the contrary, have heard\r\ngrave sounds, and not sharp ones.\r\n\r\nAll would learn, were it deemed expedient to teach them, the\r\nmechanism of speech. But, besides that the sounds which they would\r\nutter, would never be heard by themselves, and they would never be\r\nconscious of having uttered them, those, sounds would be to those who\r\nmight listen to them infinitely disagreeable. Never could they be of\r\nuse, to them in conversing with us, and they would serve only to\r\ncounteract their instruction.\r\n\r\nWoe be to the deaf and dumb whom it should be proposed to instruct by\r\nteaching them to speak! How, in fact, can, the development of the\r\nunderstanding be assisted by teaching them a mechanism which has no\r\nobject or destination, when the thought already formed in the mind,\r\nby the help of signs which fix the ideas, restores not the mechanism\r\nof speech?\r\n\r\nOf this the Institutor has been fully sensible, and, although in his\r\npublic lessons, he explains all the efforts of the vocal instrument\r\nor organ of the voice, and proves that he could, as well as any other\r\nman, teach the deaf and dumb to make use of it, all his labour is\r\nconfined to exercising the instrument of thought, persuaded that\r\nevery thing will be obtained, when the deaf and dumb shall have\r\nlearned to arrange their ideas, and to think.\r\n\r\nIt is then only that the Institutor gives lessons of analysis. But,\r\nhow brilliant are they! You think yourself transported into a class\r\nof logic. The deaf and dumb man has ceased to be so. A contest begins\r\nbetween him and his master. All the spectators are astonished; every\r\none wishes to retain what is written on both sides. It is a lesson\r\ngiven to all present.\r\n\r\nEvery one is invited to interrogate the deaf and dumb man, and he\r\nanswers to any person whatsoever, with a pen or pencil in his hand,\r\nand in the same manner puts a question. He is asked, \"What is Time?\"\r\n--\"Time,\" says the dumb pupil, \"is a portion of duration, the nature\r\nof which is to be successive, to have commenced, and consequently to\r\nhave passed, and to be no more; to be present, and to be so through\r\nnecessity. Time,\" adds he, \"is the fleeting or the future.\" As if in\r\nthe eyes of the dumb there was nothing real in Time but the future.\r\n--\"What is eternity?\" says another to him--\"It is a day without\r\nyesterday, or to-morrow,\" replies the pupil.--\"What is a sense?\"--\"It\r\nis a vehicle for ideas.\"--\"What is duration?\"--\"It is a line which\r\nhas no end, or a circle.\"--\"What is happiness?\"--\"It is a pleasure\r\nwhich never ceases.\"--\"What is God?\"--\"The author of nature, the sun\r\nof eternity.\"--\"What is friendship?\"--\"The affection of the mind.\"\r\n--\"What is gratitude?\"--\"The memory of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand answers of this description, daily collected at\r\nthe lessons of the deaf and dumb by those who attend them, and which\r\nattest the superiority of this kind of instruction over the common\r\nmethods. Thus, this institution is not only, in regard to beneficence\r\nand humanity, deserving of the admiration of men of feeling, it\r\nmerits also the observation of men of superior understanding and true\r\nphilosophers, on account of the ingenious process employed here to\r\nsupply the place of the sense of seeing by that of hearing, and\r\nspeech by gesture and writing.\r\n\r\nI must not conceal from my countrymen, above all, that the\r\nInstitutor, in his public lessons, formally declares, that it is by\r\ngiving to the French language the simple form of ours, and\r\naccommodating to it our syntax, he has been chiefly successful in\r\nmaking the deaf and dumb understand that of their own country. I must\r\nalso add, that it is no more than a justice due to the Institutor to\r\nsay that, in the midst of the concourse of auditors, who press round\r\nhim, and who offer him the homage due to his genius and philanthropy,\r\nhe shews for all the English an honourable preference, acknowledging\r\nto them, publicly, that this attention is a debt which he discharges\r\nin return for the asylum that we granted to the unfortunate persons\r\nof his profession, who, emigrating from their native land, came among\r\nus to seek consolation, and found another home.\r\n\r\nShould ever this feeble sketch of so interesting an institution reach\r\nSICARD, that religious philosopher, who belongs as much to every\r\ncountry in the world as to France, the land which gave him birth, he\r\nwill find in it nothing more than the expression of the gratitude of\r\none Englishman; but he may promise himself that as soon as the\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace shall have reopened a free intercourse\r\nbetween the two nations, the sentiments contained in it will be\r\nadopted by all the English who shall witness the extraordinary\r\nsuccess of his profoundly-meditated labours. They will all hasten to\r\npay their tribute of admiration to a man, whose most gratifying\r\nreward consists in the benefits which he has had the happiness to\r\nconfer on that part of his fellow-creatures from whom Nature has\r\nwithheld her usual indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 25, 1801._\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the general tone of immorality now prevailing\r\nin this capital, and so much, that it becomes necessary to look\r\nbeyond the surface, and examine whether morals be really more corrupt\r\nhere at the present day than before the revolution. To investigate\r\nthe subject through all its various branches and ramifications, would\r\nlead me far beyond the limits of a letter. I shall therefore, as a\r\ncriterion, take a comparative view of the increase or decrease of the\r\ndifferent classes of women, who, either publicly or privately,\r\ndeviate from the paths of virtue. If we begin with the lowest rank,\r\nand ascend, step by step, to the highest, we first meet with those\r\nunfortunate creatures, known in France by the general designation of\r\n\r\nPUBLIC WOMEN.\r\n\r\nTheir number in Paris, twelve years ago, was estimated at thirty\r\nthousand; and if this should appear comparatively small, it must be\r\nconsidered how many amorous connexions here occupy the attention of\r\nthousands of men, and consequently tend to diminish the number of\r\n_public_ women.\r\n\r\nThe question is not to ascertain whether it be necessary, for the\r\ntranquillity of private families, that there should be public women.\r\nWho can fairly estimate the extent of the mischief which they\r\nproduce, or of that which they obviate? Who can accurately determine\r\nthe best means for bringing the good to overbalance the evil? But,\r\nsupposing the necessity of the measure, would it not be proper to\r\nprevent, as much as possible, that complete mixture by which virtuous\r\nfemales are often confounded with impures?\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, though himself a great admirer of the sex, was of that\r\nopinion. He had, in vain, endeavoured to banish entirely from Paris\r\nwomen of this description; by ordering that they should be condemned\r\nto be publicly whipped, and that those who harboured them, should\r\ncarry them on their shoulders to the place where the sentence was put\r\nin execution. But it was not a little singular that, while the\r\nemperor was bent on reforming the morals of the frail fair, his two\r\ndaughters, the princesses Gifla and Rotrude, were indulging in all\r\nthe vicious foibles of their nature.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, who then resided in the _Palais des Thermes_, situated\r\nin the _Rue de la Harpe_, happened to rise one winter's morning much\r\nearlier than usual. After walking for some time about his room, he\r\nwent to a window which looked into a little court belonging to the\r\npalace. How great was his astonishment, when, by the twilight, he\r\nperceived his second daughter, Rotrude, with Eginhard, his prime\r\nminister, on her back, whom she was carrying through the deep snow\r\nwhich had fallen in the night in order that the foot-steps of a man\r\nmight not be traced.\r\n\r\nWhen Lewis the _débonnaire_, his successor, ascended the throne, he\r\nundertook to reform these two princesses, whose father's fondness had\r\nprevented him from suffering them to marry. The new king began by\r\nputting to death two noblemen who passed for their lovers, thinking\r\nthat this example would intimidate, and that they would find no more:\r\nbut it appears that he was mistaken, for they were never at a loss.\r\nNor is this to be wondered at, as these princesses to a taste for\r\nliterature joined a very lively imagination, and were extremely\r\naffable, generous, and beneficent; on which account, says Father\r\nDaniel, they died universally regretted.\r\n\r\nExperience having soon proved that public women are a necessary evil\r\nin great cities, it was resolved to tolerate them. They therefore\r\nbegan to form a separate body, became subject to taxes, and had their\r\nstatutes and judges. They were called _femmes amoureuses_, _filles\r\nfolles de leur corps_, and, on St. Magdalen's day, they were\r\naccustomed to form annually a solemn procession. Particular streets\r\nwere assigned to them for their abode; and a house in each street,\r\nfor their commerce.\r\n\r\nA penitentiary asylum, called _les Filles Dieu_, was founded at Paris\r\nin 1226, and continued for some years open for the reception of\r\n_female sinners who had gone astray, and were reduced to beggary_. In\r\nthe time of St. Lewis, their number amounted to two hundred; but\r\nbecoming rich, they became dissolute, and in 1483, they were\r\nsucceeded by the reformed nuns of Fontevrault.\r\n\r\nWhen I was here in the year 1784, a great concourse of people daily\r\nvisited this convent in order to view the body of an ancient virgin\r\nand martyr, said to be that of St. Victoria, which, having been\r\nlately dug up near Rome, had just been sent to these nuns by the\r\nPope. This relic being exposed for some time to the veneration and\r\ncuriosity of the Parisian public, the devout wondered to see the fair\r\nsaint with a complexion quite fresh and rosy, after having been dead\r\nfor several centuries, and, in their opinion, this was a miracle\r\nwhich incontestably proved her sanctity. The incredulous, who did not\r\nsee things in the same light, thought that the face was artificial,\r\nand that it presented one of those holy frauds which have so\r\nfrequently furnished weapons to impiety. But they were partly\r\nmistaken: the nuns had thought proper to cover the face of the saint\r\nwith a mask, and to clothe her from head to foot, in order to skreen\r\nfrom the eyes of the public the hideous spectacle of a skeleton.\r\n\r\nIn 1420, Lewis VIII, with a view of distinguishing impures from\r\nmodest women, forbade the former to wear golden girdles, then in\r\nfashion. This prohibition was vain, and the virtuous part of the sex\r\nconsoled themselves by the testimony of their conscience, whence the\r\nold proverb: \"_Bonne rénommée vaut mieux que ceinture dorée_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother establishment, first called _Les Filles pénitentes ou\r\nrepenties_, and afterwards _Filles de St. Magloire_, was instituted\r\nin 1497 by a Cordelier, and had the same destination. He preached\r\nagainst libertinism, and with such success, that two hundred\r\ndissolute women were converted by his fervent eloquence. The friar\r\nadmitted them into his congregation, which was sanctioned by the\r\nPope. Its statutes, which were drawn up by the Bishop of Paris, are\r\nnot a little curious. Among other things, it was established, that\r\n\"none should be received but women who had led a dissolute life, and\r\nthat, in order to ascertain the fact, they should be examined by\r\nmatrons, who should swear on the Holy Evangelists to make a faithful\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that women were well taken care of in this\r\nhouse, since it was supposed that virtue even might assume the mask\r\nof vice to obtain admission. The fact is singular. \"To prevent girls\r\nfrom prostituting themselves in order to be received, those who shall\r\nhave been once examined and refused, shall be excluded for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, the candidates shall be obliged to swear, under penalty of\r\ntheir eternal damnation, in presence of their confessor and six nuns,\r\nthat they did not prostitute themselves with a view of entering into\r\nthis congregation; and in order that women of bad character may not\r\nwait too long before they become converted, in the hope that the door\r\nwill always be open to them, none will be received above the age of\r\nthirty.\"\r\n\r\nThis community, for some years, continued tolerably numerous; but its\r\ndestination had been changed long before the suppression of convents,\r\nwhich took place in the early part of the revolution. All the places\r\nof public prostitution in Paris, after having been tolerated upwards\r\nof four hundred years, were abolished by a decree of the States\r\nGeneral, held at Orleans in 1560. The number of women of the town,\r\nhowever, was far from being diminished, though their profession was\r\nno longer considered as a trade; and as they were prohibited from\r\nbeing any where, that is, in any fixed place, they were compelled to\r\nspread themselves every where.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, the number of these women in Paris is computed at\r\ntwenty-five thousand: they are taken up as formerly, in order to be\r\nsent into infirmaries, whence they, generally, come out only to\r\nreturn to their former habits. Twelve years ago, those apprehended\r\nunderwent a public examination once a month, and were commonly\r\nsentenced to a confinement, more or less long, according to the\r\npleasure of the minister of the police. The examination of them\r\nbecame a matter of amusement for persons of not over-delicate\r\nfeelings. The hardened females, neither respecting the judge not the\r\naudience, impudently repeated the language and gestures of their\r\ntraffic. The judge added a fortnight's imprisonment for every insult,\r\nand the most abandoned were confined only a few months longer in the\r\n_Salpétrière_.\r\n\r\nEndeavours have since been made to improve the internal regulation of\r\nthis and similar houses of correction; but, as far as my information\r\ngoes, with little success. For want of separating, from the beginning\r\nof their confinement, the most debauched from those whom a moment of\r\ndistress or error has thrown into these scenes of depravity, the\r\ncontamination of bad example rapidly spreads, and those who enter\r\ndissolute, frequently come out thievish; while all timidity is\r\nbanished from the mind of the more diffident. Besides, it is not\r\nalways the most culpable who fall into the hands of the police, the\r\nmore cunning and experienced, by contriving to come to terms with its\r\nagents, employed on these errands, generally escape; and thus the\r\nobject in view is entirely defeated.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the _Salpétrière_, the healthy are separated from\r\nthe diseased; and the latter are sent to _Bicêtre_, where they either\r\nfind a cure or death. Your imagination will supply the finishing\r\nstrokes of this frightful picture.--These unfortunate victims of\r\nindigence or of the seduction of man, are deserving of compassion.\r\nWith all their vices, they have, after all, one less than many of\r\ntheir sex who pride themselves on chastity, without really possessing\r\nit; that is, hypocrisy. As they shew themselves to be what they\r\nreally are, they cannot make the secret mischief which a detected\r\nprude not unfrequently occasions under the deceitful mask of modesty.\r\nDegraded in their own eyes, and being no longer able to reign through\r\nthe graces of virtue, they fall into the opposite extreme, and\r\ndisplay all the audaciousness of vice.\r\n\r\nThe next class we come to is that which was almost honoured by the\r\nGreeks, and tolerated by the Romans, under the denomination of\r\n\r\nCOURTESANS.\r\n\r\nBy courtesans, I mean those ladies who, decked out in all the luxury\r\nof dress, if not covered with diamonds, put up their favours to the\r\nhighest bidder, without having either more beauty or accomplishments,\r\nperhaps, than the distressed female who sells hers at the lowest\r\nprice. But caprice, good fortune, intrigue, or artifice, sometimes\r\noccasions an enormous distance between women who have the same views.\r\n\r\nIf the ancients made great sacrifices for the Phrynes, the Laïses, or\r\nthe Aspasias of the day, among the moderns, no nation has, in that\r\nrespect, surpassed the French. Every one has heard of the luxurious\r\nextravagance of Mademoiselle Deschamps, the cushion of whose\r\n_chaise-percée_, was trimmed with point-lace of very considerable\r\nvalue, and the harness of whose carriage was studded with paste, in\r\nimitation of diamonds. This woman, however, lived to repent of her\r\nfolly; and if she did not literally die in a poorhouse, she at least\r\nended her days in wretchedness.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, of all the gay ladies in Paris, Madame\r\nGrandval displayed the greatest luxury in her equipage; and\r\nMademoiselle D'Hervieux, in her house. I knew them both. The former I\r\nhave seen at Longchamp, as well as at the annual review of the king's\r\nhousehold troops, in a splendid coach, as fine as that of any Lord\r\nMayor, drawn by a set of eight English grays, which cost a hundred\r\nand twenty guineas a horse. She sat, like a queen, adorned with a\r\nprofusion of jewels; and facing her was a _dame de compagnie_,\r\nrepresenting a lady of the bedchamber. Behind the carriage, stood no\r\nless than three tall footmen, besides a chasseur, in the style of\r\nthat of the Duke of Gloucester, in rich liveries, with swords, canes,\r\nand bags.\r\n\r\nAs for the house of Mademoiselle D'Hervieux, it was every thing that\r\noriental luxury, combined with French taste, could unite on a small\r\nscale. Although of very low origin, and by no means gifted with a\r\nhandsome person, this lady, after having, rather late in life,\r\nobtained an introduction on the opera-stage as a common _figurante_,\r\ncontrived to insinuate herself into the good graces of some rich\r\nprotectors. On the _Chaussée d'Antin_, they built for her this palace\r\nin miniature, which, twelve years ago, was the object of universal\r\nadmiration, and, in fact, was visited by strangers as one of the\r\ncuriosities of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, one neither sees nor hears of such favourites of\r\nfortune; and, for want of subjects to paint under this head, I must\r\nproceed to those of the next rank, who are styled\r\n\r\nKEPT WOMEN.\r\n\r\nWhat distinctions, what shades, what different names to express\r\nalmost one and the same thing! From the haughty fair in a brilliant\r\nequipage, figuring, like a favourite Sultana, with \"all the pride,\r\npomp, and circumstance\" of the toilet, down to the hunger-pinched\r\nfemale, who stands shivering in the evening at the corner of a\r\nstreet, what gradations in the same profession!\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, there were reckoned in Paris eight or ten\r\nthousand women to whom the rich nobility or financiers allowed from a\r\nthousand pounds a year upwards to an almost incredible amount. Some\r\nof these ladies have ruined a whole family in the short space of six\r\nmonths; and, having nothing left at the year's end, were then under\r\nthe necessity of parting with their diamonds for a subsistence.\r\nAlthough many of them are far inferior in opulence to the courtesans,\r\nthey are less depraved, and, consequently, superior to them in\r\nestimation. They have a lover, who pays, and from whom they, in\r\ngeneral, get all they can, at the same time turning him into\r\nridicule, and another whom, in their turn, they pay, and for whom\r\nthey commit a thousand follies.\r\n\r\nThese women used to have no medium in their attachments; they were\r\neither quite insensible to the soft passion, or loved almost to\r\ndistraction. On the wane, they had the rage for marrying, and many of\r\nthem found men who, preferring fortune to honour, disgraced\r\nthemselves by such alliances. Some of these ladies, if handsome, were\r\nnot unfrequently taken by a man of fortune, and kept from mere\r\nostentation, just as he would sport a superlatively elegant carriage,\r\nor ride a very capital horse; others were maintained from caprice,\r\nwhich, like Achilles's spear, carried with it its own antidote; and\r\nthen, of course, they passed into the hands of different keepers. It\r\ncannot be denied, however that a few of these connexions were founded\r\non attachment; and when the woman, who was the object of it, was\r\npossessed of understanding, she assumed the manners and deportment of\r\na wife. Indeed, now and then a keeper adopted the style of oriental\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\nBeaujon, the banker of the court, who had amassed an immense fortune,\r\nindulged himself in his old age, and, till his death, in a society\r\ncomposed of pretty women, some of whom belonged to what was then\r\ntermed good families, among which he had diffused his presents. In an\r\nelegant habitation, called _la Chartreuse_, which he erected in the\r\n_Faubourg du Roule_, as a place of occasional retirement, was a most\r\ncurious apartment, representing a bower, in the midst of which was\r\nplaced a bedstead in imitation of a basket of flowers: four trees,\r\nwhose verdant foliage extended over part of the ceiling, which was\r\npainted as a sky, seemed to shade this basket, and supported drapery,\r\nsuspended to their branches. This was M. Beaujon's Temple of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe late Prince of Soubise, for some years, constantly kept ten or a\r\ndozen ladies. The only intercourse he had with them, was to breakfast\r\nor chat with them twice or thrice a month, and latterly he maintained\r\nseveral old stagers, in this manner, from motives of benevolence. At\r\nthe end of the month, all these ladies came in their carriages at a\r\nfixed hour, in a string, as it were, one after the other. The steward\r\nhad their money ready; they afterwards, one by one, entered a very\r\nspacious room furnished with large closets, filled with silks,\r\nmuslins, laces, ribbands, &c. The prince distributed presents to\r\neach, according to her age and taste: thus ended a visit of mere\r\nceremony, interspersed with a few words of general gallantry.\r\n\r\nSuch was the style in which many women were kept by men of fortune\r\nunder the old _régime_. At the present day, if we except twenty or\r\nthirty perhaps, it would be no easy matter to discover any women\r\nsupported in a style of elegance in Paris, and the lot of these seems\r\nscarcely secured but from month to month. The reason of this mystery\r\nis, that the modern Croesuses having mostly acquired their riches in\r\na clandestine manner, they take every possible precaution to prevent\r\nthe reports in circulation concerning their ill-gotten pelf from\r\nbeing confirmed by a display of luxury in their _chères amies_. On\r\nthis account, many a matrimonial connexion, I am told, is formed\r\nbetween them and women of equivocal character, on the principle, that\r\na man is better able to check the extravagant excesses of his wife\r\nthan those of his mistress.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at that class of females who move in a sphere of life\r\nthe best calculated for making conquests. I mean\r\n\r\nOPERA-DANCERS.\r\n\r\nWhen a spectator, whose eyes are fascinated by the illusion of scenic\r\ndecorations, contemplates those beauties whose voluptuous postures,\r\nunder the form of Calypso, Eucharis, Delphis, &c. awaken desire in\r\nthe mind of youth, and even of persons of maturer years, he forgets\r\nthat the divinities before him are women, who not unfrequently lavish\r\ntheir favours on the common herd of mortals. His imagination lends to\r\nthem a thousand secret charms which they possess not; and he cannot\r\nbe persuaded that they are not tremblingly alive to a passion which\r\nthey express with so much apparent feeling. It is in their arms only\r\nthat he discovers his error. To arrive at this point, many an\r\nEnglishman has sacrificed thousands of pounds; while his faithless\r\nfair has been indulging in all the wantonness of her disposition,\r\nperhaps, with some obscure Frenchman among the long train of her\r\nhumble admirers. Hence the significant appellation of _Milord\r\nPot-au-feu_, given to one who supports a woman whose favours\r\nanother enjoys _gratis_.\r\n\r\nSuch an opera-dancer used formerly to exhibit herself in a blaze of\r\njewels in the lobby, and according to the style in which she figured,\r\ndid she obtain respect from her companions. The interval between them\r\nwas proportioned to the degree of opulence which the one enjoyed over\r\nthe other, so that the richer scarcely appeared to belong to the same\r\nprofession as the poorer. To the former, every shopkeeper became a\r\ncandidate for custom; presents were heaped on presents, and gold was\r\nshowered on her in such a manner that she might, for the time, almost\r\nhave fancied herself a second Danaë.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this good fortune, perhaps, an obscure rival suddenly\r\nstarted into fashion. She then was eclipsed by her whom, a few days\r\nbefore, she disdained. Instead of a succession of visiters, her house\r\nwas deserted; and, at the expiration of the year, the proud fair,\r\nawakened from her golden dream by the clamours of her importunate\r\ncreditors, found herself without one friend to rescue her valuables\r\nfrom their rapacious gripe.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that this order of things, (excepting the reverse by\r\nwhich it was sometimes followed) was very agreeable to the great\r\nmajority of these capering beauties, and, doubtless, they wished its\r\nduration. For, among the reports of the _secret_ police, maintained\r\nby Lewis XVI, in 1792, it appears by a letter addressed to M. de\r\nCaylus, and found among the King's papers in the palace of the\r\n_Tuileries_, that most of the female opera-dancers were staunch\r\n_aristocrates_; but that democracy triumphed among the women who sang\r\nat that theatre. This little anecdote shews how far curiosity was\r\nthen stretched to ascertain what is called public opinion; and I have\r\nno doubt that the result confirmed the correctness of the statement.\r\n\r\nThe opera-stage was certainly never so rich as it now is in\r\nfirst-rate female dancers, yet the frail part of these beauties were\r\nnever so deficient, perhaps, in wealthy admirers. Proceeding to the\r\nnext order of meretricious fair, we meet with that numerous one\r\ndenominated\r\n\r\nGRISETTES.\r\n\r\nThis is the name applied to those young girls who, being obliged to\r\nsubsist by their labour, chiefly fill the shops of milliners,\r\nmantua-makers, and sellers of ready-made linen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe rank which ought to be assigned to them, I think, is between\r\nopera-dancers and demireps. You may smile at the distinction; but, as\r\nMr. Tickle justly observes, in the Spectator, we should vary our\r\nappellations of these fair criminals, according to circumstances.\r\n\"Those who offend only against themselves,\" says he, \"and are not a\r\nscandal to society; but, out of deference to the sober part of the\r\nworld, have so much good left in them as to be ashamed, must not be\r\ncomprehended in the common word due to the worst of women. Regard is\r\nto be had to their situation when they fell, to the uneasy perplexity\r\nin which they lived under senseless and severe parents, to the\r\nimportunity of poverty, to the violence of a passion in its beginning\r\nwell-grounded, to all the alleviations which make unhappy women\r\nresign the characteristic of their sex, modesty. To do otherwise than\r\nthus,\" adds he, \"would be to act like a pedantic Stoic, who thinks\r\nall crimes alike, and not as an impartial spectator, who views them\r\nwith all the circumstances that diminish or enhance the guilt.\"\r\n\r\nIf we measure them by this standard, _grisettes_ appear entitled to\r\nbe classed immediately below demireps; for, as Lear says of his\r\ndaughter,\r\n\r\n  \"-------- Not to be the worst\r\n  Stands in some rank of praise.\"\r\n\r\nTheir principal merit consists in their conducting themselves with a\r\ncertain degree of decorum and reserve, and in being susceptible of\r\nattachment. Born in an humble sphere, they are accustomed from their\r\ninfancy to gain their livelihood by their industry. Like young birds\r\nthat feel the power of using their wings, they fly from the\r\nparent-nest at the age of sixteen; and, hiring a room for themselves,\r\nthey live according to their means and fancy.\r\n\r\nMore fortunate in their indigence than the daughters of petty\r\ntradesmen, they overleap the limits of restraint, while their charms\r\nare in full lustre; and sometimes their happiness arises from being\r\nborn in poverty. In marrying an artisan of their own class, they see\r\nnothing but distress and servitude, which are by no means compatible\r\nwith their spirit of independence. Vanity becomes their guide, and is\r\nas bad a guide as distress; for it prompts them to add the resources\r\nof their youth and person to those of their needle. This double\r\ntemptation is too strong for their weak virtue. They therefore seek a\r\nfriend to console them on Sundays for the _ennui_ of the remainder of\r\nthe week, which must needs seem long, when they are sitting close at\r\nwork from morning to night. In general, they are more faithful than\r\nany of the other classes of the frail part of the sex, and may be\r\nsupported at little expense, and without scandal.\r\n\r\nIt would require almost the powers of the inquisition to ascertain\r\nwhether _grisettes_ have increased or diminished since the\r\nrevolution; but their number is, and always has been, immense in\r\nParis. An object highly deserving of the attention of the French\r\nlegislators would be to find a remedy for this evil. A mortal blow\r\nshould, no doubt, be struck at the luxury of the toilet; as the rage\r\nfor dress has, I am convinced, undermined the virtue of as many women\r\nas the vile stratagems of all the Lotharios in being. Leaving these\r\nmatters to some modern Lycurgus, I shall end my letter. But, in my\r\neager haste to close it, I must not omit a class, which has increased\r\nin a proportion equal to the decrease of kept women. As they have no\r\nprecise designation in France, I shall take the liberty of applying\r\nto them, that of\r\n\r\nDEMIREPS.\r\n\r\nWithout having the shameless effrontery of vice, these ladies have\r\nnot the austere rigour of virtue. Seeing that professed courtesans\r\ninsnared the most promising youths, and snatched them from other\r\nwomen, this description of females sprang up, in a manner, to dispute\r\nwith them, under the rose, the advantages which the others derived\r\nfrom their traffic. If they have not the same boldness in their\r\ncarriage, their looks bespeak almost as much complaisance. They\r\ndeclaim loudly against women of all the classes before-mentioned, for\r\nthe best possible reason; because these are their more dangerous\r\nrivals. It is certain that a virtuous woman cannot hold the breach of\r\nchastity too much in abhorrence, but every Lucretia ought to have \"a\r\ntear for pity,\" especially towards the fallen part of her sex.\r\nNothing can be more disgusting than to hear women, who are known to\r\nhave transgressed, forget their own frailties, and rail against the\r\nmore unguarded, and, consequently, more artless part of womankind,\r\nwithout mercy or justice.\r\n\r\nDemireps, in general, profess the greatest disinterestedness in their\r\nconnexions; but if they receive no money at the moment of granting\r\ntheir favours, they accept trinkets and other presents which have\r\nsome value. It is not at all uncommon for a man to think that he has\r\na _bonne fortune_, when he finds himself on terms of intimacy with\r\nsuch a woman. Enraptured at his success, he repeats his visits, till\r\none day he surprises his belle, overwhelmed by despair. He eagerly\r\ninquires the cause. After much entreaty, she informs him that she has\r\nhad ill luck at play, and, with anguish in her looks, laments that\r\nshe is ruined beyond redemption. The too credulous admirer can do no\r\nless than accommodate her secretly with a sufficient sum to prevent\r\nher from being taken to task by her husband; and thus the\r\ndisinterested lady proves, in the end, a greater drain to the\r\ngallant's pocket than the most mercenary courtesan.\r\n\r\nThe man who would wish to recommend himself to their favour, scarcely\r\nneed take any further trouble than to change some of their trinkets,\r\nwhich are no longer in fashion. Sometimes he may meet with a husband,\r\nwho, conniving at his wife's infidelity, will shew him every mark of\r\nattention. In that case, the lover is quite at home, and his presence\r\nbeing equally agreeable to the obliging husband as to the kind wife,\r\nwhen they are all three assembled, they seem to fit their several\r\nplaces like the three sides of an equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution, the increase of demireps is said to have\r\ndiminished most sensibly the class of what are termed kept women.\r\nIndeed, it is affirmed by some, that the number of the former has,\r\nwithin these few years, multiplied in a tenfold proportion. Others\r\nagain maintain that it is no greater than it was formerly; because,\r\nsay they, the state of society in Paris is not near so favourable to\r\namorous intrigue as that which existed under the old _régime_. Riches\r\nbeing more equally divided, few persons, comparatively speaking, are\r\nnow sufficiently affluent to entertain large parties, and give routs,\r\nballs, and suppers, where a numerous assemblage afforded, to those\r\ninclined to dissipation, every opportunity of cultivating an intimate\r\nacquaintance. I must confess that these reasons, assigned by some\r\nworthy Frenchmen whose opinions I respect, do not altogether accord\r\nwith the result of my observation; and, without taking on myself to\r\ncontrovert them, I am persuaded that truth will bear me out in\r\nasserting, that, if the morals of that class of society in which I\r\nhave chiefly mixed during the different periods of my stay in France,\r\nare not deteriorated, they are certainly not improved since I last\r\nvisited Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter having painted, in regular succession, and with colours\r\noccasionally borrowed, the general portrait of all those classes of\r\nfemales whose likeness every English traveller has, no doubt, met\r\nwith, I must find a little corner of my canvass for a small number of\r\nwomen who might, probably, be sought in vain out of Paris. However\r\ngreat a recommendation their rarity may be in the eyes of some, still\r\nit is not the only quality that points them out to the notice of the\r\nimpartial observer.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has come to his senses respecting the sex, or, according\r\nto the vulgar adage, sown his wild oats, he naturally seeks a sincere\r\nfriend to whom he can unbosom himself with confidence. Experience\r\nwarns him that few men are to be trusted; and unless he has had the\r\ngood fortune to meet with a virtuous wife, blessed with an engaging\r\ntemper and a good understanding, he must even, like Junius, be the\r\ndepository of his own secret. In Paris, however, he may find one of\r\nthose scarce females, who, being accustomed early in life to\r\nreflection, possess the firm mind of a man, combined with the quick\r\nsensibility of a woman.\r\n\r\nWhen the illusion of the first passions is dissipated, their reason\r\nbecomes unclouded. Renouncing every narrow thought, they raise\r\nthemselves to the knowledge of the most weighty affairs, and, by an\r\nactive observation of mankind, are accustomed to discriminate every\r\nshade of character. Hence their penetration is great; and they are\r\ncapable of giving good advice on important occasions. In short, a\r\nFrench woman at thirty makes an excellent friend, and, attaching\r\nherself to the man she esteems, thinks no sacrifice too great for the\r\nadvancement of his interest, or the security of his happiness or\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between man and woman is a thousand times more sweet\r\nthan that between one man and another. A woman's friendship is\r\nactive, vigilant, and at the same time tender. French women cherish\r\nmore sincerely their old friends than their young lovers. They may\r\nperchance deceive the lover, but never the friend; the latter they\r\nconsider as a sacred being. Whence, no doubt, Rousseau (who has not\r\nspared the Parisian ladies) has been led to say: \"I would never have\r\nsought in Paris a wife, still less a mistress; but I would willingly\r\nhave made there a female friend; and this treasure would, perhaps,\r\nhave consoled me for not finding the other two.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 27, 1801._\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago, a public insult offered to human nature, in\r\nthe person of some unfortunate blind men belonging to the Hospital of\r\nthe _Quinze-vingts_, and repeated daily for the space of two months,\r\nsuggested to a spectator the idea of avenging it in a manner worthy\r\nof a true philanthropist.\r\n\r\nIn a coffeehouse of the _Foire St. Ovide_, in Paris, were placed ten\r\nblind beggars, muffled up in grotesque dresses and long pointed caps,\r\nwith large paste-board spectacles on their nose, without glass: music\r\nand lights were set before them; and one of them was characterized as\r\nMidas, with the ears of an ass, and the addition of a peacock's tail,\r\nspread behind him. He sang, while all the others played the same\r\nparts of a monotonous tune, without either taste or measure; and the\r\nunfeeling public turned into derision the unfortunate actors in this\r\ninfamous scene. This happened in September 1771.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, M. VALENTIN HAÜY, brother to the celebrated\r\nmineralogist of that name, animated by a noble enthusiasm, conceived\r\nthe project of teaching the blind to write and read, and of placing\r\nin their hands books and music, printed by themselves. After\r\nemploying twelve years in maturing it, at length, in 1784, he\r\nventured to carry it into execution. To so laudable and benevolent a\r\npurpose, he devoted all his fortune; and hence originated the\r\nestablishment known in Paris, since the year 1791, by the title of\r\n\r\nNATIONAL INSTITUTION OF THE INDUSTRIOUS BLIND.\r\n\r\nPresently M. HAÜY found his plan seconded by the Philanthropic\r\nSociety, and the benefactions and advice of several persons, no less\r\ndistinguished for understanding than benevolence, contributed not a\r\nlittle to encourage his zeal in its prosecution. The following were\r\nthe primary objects of the establishment.\r\n\r\n1. To withdraw the blind from the dangerous paths of idleness.\r\n\r\n2. To procure them certain means of subsistence by the execution of\r\npleasant and easy labours.\r\n\r\n3. To restore them to society.\r\n\r\n4. To console them for their misfortune.\r\n\r\nTo rescue the blind from idleness is, unquestionably, of itself a\r\ngreat blessing, as it preserves them from an infinite number of\r\nvices, and consequently must be approved by the moralist. But another\r\nadvantage, equally deserving of approbation, is to cause them to\r\nfind, in their labour, an infallible resource against indigence.\r\nPreviously to the execution of this beneficent plan, a young blind\r\nchild, born of poor parents, was reduced to the melancholy and\r\nhumiliating necessity of standing in a public thoroughfare, exposed\r\nto all the inclemency of the weather, to beg its bread, and, at\r\npresent, it has no occasion to owe its livelihood but to its own\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe children that M. HAÜY had to educate were, in general, of the\r\nclass of artisans, though a few belonged to that of artists and men\r\nof science. Some were born with a little aptitude for mechanical\r\nlabours, others with a great disposition for the arts and sciences.\r\nThese considerations naturally pointed out to him his plan of\r\ninstruction, which is divided into four branches.\r\n\r\nI. Handicraft work, viz. Spinning, knitting, making of cord, fringe,\r\ntrimming, ribband, pasteboard, &c.\r\n\r\nTask-masters direct the execution of these works, which are as easy\r\nto the blind as to the clear-sighted.\r\n\r\nII. Education, viz. Reading, writing, arithmetic, geography,\r\nliterature, history, foreign languages, arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThis education of blind children is carried on by means of\r\nraised-work or relief, and is intrusted to other blind people\r\nwhose education is completed. The latter not only instruct their\r\nunfortunate fellow-sufferers, but also the clear-sighted.\r\n\r\nThe sense of feeling is so refined in blind children, that a pupil, a\r\nlittle informed, becomes perfectly acquainted with maps by handling\r\nthem: he points out with his finger countries and towns; if a map is\r\npresented to him upside down, he places it in a proper manner, and if\r\none map is substituted to another, he instantly discovers the\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\nIII. Printing, viz. In black characters, for the public. In relief,\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nIn black, they have printed no inconsiderable number of voluminous\r\nworks, for the use of the public. In relief, they have printed for\r\nthemselves a catechism, a grammar, and a great quantity of music. No\r\nwhere but at this institution, and at the MUSEUM OF THE BLIND, of\r\nwhich I shall presently speak, is there to be found an office for\r\nprinting in relief.\r\n\r\nIV. Music, viz. Vocal and instrumental, and composition.\r\n\r\nThe music of the blind pupils has always been employed with the\r\ngreatest success in public festivals, playhouses, balls,\r\ncoffeehouses, and many public and private assemblies. It is\r\nimpossible to form an adequate idea of the decided taste of the blind\r\nfor music, and of the consolation which it affords them. Deprived of\r\ntheir eyes, they seem to become all ears.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had M. HAÜY rendered public his first essays, than the\r\nlearned, and especially the members of the _ci-devant_ Academy of\r\nSciences, stamped them with their approbation, as appears by a Report\r\nsigned by some of the most distinguished of that body, such as\r\nDESMARETS, LA ROCHEFOUCAULT, CONDORCET, &c. Professors of the arts,\r\ncultivated by his pupils, such as printing, music, &c. were equally\r\neager to acknowledge to what an astonishing degree the blind had\r\nsucceeded in appropriating to themselves the enjoyment of those arts.\r\nThree of the first master-printers in Paris certified the\r\nintelligence and skill of the blind pupils; and a concert was\r\nexecuted by them to the no small satisfaction of the _ci-devant_\r\nAcademy of Music.\r\n\r\nPersons of every degree now wished to be spectators of the result of\r\nthese essays. Lewis XVI sent for the Industrious Blind, their\r\nmachinery, &c. to Versailles; he visited them when at work, and\r\ninspected their several performances, attended by all the royal\r\nfamily, princes of the blood, ministers, ambassadors, &c. After\r\nhaving procured the inhabitants of that town this interesting sight\r\nfor several successive days, he rewarded the blind with marks of his\r\nfavour and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe government, which succeeded to the monarchy, shewed no less\r\ninterest in the progress of M. HAÜY'S undertaking. The different\r\nlegislatures, which have successively governed France, promoted it by\r\nvarious decrees. In proportion as the number of the pupils increased,\r\nso did the resources of their industrious activity. By a law which\r\nwas solicited by M. HAÜY, and which excited and kept up a singular\r\nemulation among his pupils, the blind, in preference to the\r\nclear-sighted of equal merit, were admitted to the various secondary\r\nemployments of the establishment. From that period, the first blind\r\npupils, formed by M. HAÜY, being promoted to the functions of\r\nteachers, transmitted with success to young blind children, sent for\r\ninstruction, from different parts of the Republic, the first elements\r\nof education given them by himself and assistants. By virtue of this\r\nlaw, the office of house-steward was intrusted to LESUEUR, a blind\r\npupil who had already discharged it with credit at a banker's. It\r\nwill scarcely be believed, no doubt, that a blind man can be a\r\ncashier, receive money coming in, either from the public treasury, or\r\nfrom the industry of his brothers in misfortune; make of it a\r\nsuitable division; buy commodities  necessary for life and clothing;\r\nintroduce the strictest economy into his disbursements; by means of\r\nhis savings, procure the establishment the implements and machinery\r\nof the Industrious Blind; in times of real scarcity, make use of the\r\nproductions of the labour of the grown blind, to maintain the young\r\nblind pupils, and that, with all these concerns on his hands, his\r\naccounts should always be ready for inspection.\r\n\r\nM. HAÜY informs me that out of fifteen or twenty of his old pupils,\r\nwhom he has connected by the ties of marriage, ten or twelve are\r\nfathers; and that they have children more fortunate than the authors\r\nof their days, since the enjoy the benefit of sight. But the most\r\ninteresting part of these connexions is, that the blind father (on\r\nthe principle of the plan before-stated) teaches his clear-sighted\r\nson reading, arithmetic, music, and every thing that it is possible\r\nto teach without the help of the eyes.\r\n\r\nRaised work, or relief, is the simple and general process by means of\r\nwhich M. HAÜY forms his pupils, and there are a great number of them\r\nwhose abilities would excite the pride of many a clear-sighted\r\nperson. For instance, in addition to the before-mentioned LESUEUR,\r\nwho is an excellent geographer and a good mathematician, might be\r\nquoted HUARD, a man of erudition and a correct printer; likewise\r\nCAILLAT, a capital performer on the violin, and a celebrated\r\ncomposer. For vocal and instrumental music, printing, and handicraft\r\nwork, there might be noticed thirty or forty, as well as ten or\r\ntwelve for knowledge relating to the sciences.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to observe, that M. HAÜY always first puts a\r\nframe into the hands of his pupils, and that he has made a law, to\r\nwhich he scrupulously adheres, not to lean too much towards the\r\n_agreeable_ arts, unless the pupil manifest for them a peculiar\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nHence you may form an idea of the proficiency which these\r\nunfortunates attain under the auspices of the benevolent M. HAÜY. In\r\nthe compass of a letter, or even of several letters, it is impossible\r\nto develope proceedings which it is more easy to put into execution\r\nthan to describe. The process alone of printing in relief would\r\nrequire a vast number of pages, and some plates, in order to make it\r\nperfectly intelligible; but the greater part of what composes these\r\nbranches of instruction is amply detailed in a work, which I shall\r\ncommunicate to you, entitled \"_Essai sur l'Éducation des Aveugles_,\r\n_par_ Valentin Haüy, _auteur de la manière de les instruire_,\"\r\nprinted under the sanction of the _ci-devant_ Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nBy a law on public education, passed in July 1796, several\r\nestablishments were to be founded in favour of blind children, in the\r\nprincipal towns of the Republic; but, in consequence of the political\r\nchanges which have since occurred in the government, it has never\r\nbeen carried into execution.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1800, the Consuls decreed that the _National Institution\r\nof the Industrious Blind_ should be united to the Hospital of the\r\n_Quinze-vingts_, together with the soldiers who had lost their sight\r\nin Egypt. M. HAÜY is shortly to be honoured by a pension, as a reward\r\nfor the services which he has bestowed on those afflicted with\r\nblindness. At the present moment, he is engaged in founding a second\r\nestablishment, of a similar nature, which is to take the name of\r\n\r\nMUSEUM OF THE BLIND.\r\n\r\nOn my asking M. HAÜY, whether he would not retire, as it was intended\r\nhe should, on his pension? \"This favour of the government,\" replied\r\nhe, \"I consider as a fresh obligation, silently imposed on me, to\r\ncontinue to be of service to the blind. The first establishment,\r\nsupported and paid by the nation, belonged to the poor. In forming\r\nthe second,\" added he, \"I have yielded to the wishes of parents in\r\neasy circumstances, who were desirous of giving to their blind\r\nchildren a liberal education.\"\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned, that, agreeably to M. HAÜY'S plan, the\r\nblind instruct the clear-sighted; and in this Museum, which is\r\nsituated _Rue Sainte Avoie, Hôtel de Mêsme, No. 19_, the former are\r\nto be seen directing a class of fifty youths, whom they instruct in\r\nevery branch before-mentioned, writing excepted. It is also in\r\ncontemplation to teach a blind pupil _pasigraphy_, or universal\r\nlanguage, invented by DEMAIMIEUX.\r\n\r\nM. HAÜY details to strangers every part of his plan with the most\r\npatient and obliging attention. When he had concluded, I could not\r\navoid expressing a wish that the art of instructing the blind in the\r\nfullest extent might be speedily introduced among all nations. \"After\r\nhaving paid to my country,\" rejoined M. HAÜY, \"the merited homage of\r\nmy invention, my anxiety to contribute to the relief of the\r\nafflicted, wherever they may be found, gives birth to the desire of\r\npropagating, as much as possible, an institution which enlightened\r\nmen and philanthropists have been pleased to recommend to the\r\nattention of foreigners and to the esteem of my countrymen, as may be\r\nseen by consulting different literary publications from the year 1785\r\ndown to the present time, particularly the new French Encyclopædia,\r\nat the article _Aveugle_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should,\" added he, \"perform a task very agreeable to my feelings\r\nin concurring, by my advice and knowledge, to lay in England the\r\nfoundation of an establishment of a description similar to either of\r\nthose which I have founded in Paris. One of my pupils in the art of\r\ninstructing the blind, M. GRANCHER, a member of several learned\r\nsocieties in France, and possessed of my means and method, would\r\nvoluntarily devote his talents and experience to the success of such\r\nan undertaking, to which he is himself strongly attached through\r\nphilanthropy and zeal for my reputation.\"--\"I am persuaded,\"\r\ninterrupted I, \"that were the advantages of such an establishment\r\nmade public in England, it would receive the countenance and support\r\nof every friend of human nature.\"--\"It is an unquestionable fact,\"\r\nconcluded M. Haüy, \"that an institution of fifty blind, well\r\nconducted, ought, by their labour, to produce more than would defray\r\nits expenses. I have already even tried with success to apply to the\r\nEnglish tongue my method of reading, which is so contrived for the\r\nFrench language, that I need not give more than two or three lessons\r\nto a blind child, in order to enable him to teach himself to read,\r\nwithout the further help of any master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 29, 1801._\r\n\r\nSuch a crowd of different objects present themselves to my mind,\r\nwhenever I sit down to write to you, that, frequently as I have\r\nvisited the Grand French Opera since my arrival here, I have been\r\nhesitating whether I should make it the subject of this letter.\r\nHowever, as it is one of the first objects of attraction to a\r\nstranger, and the first in a theatrical point of view, I think you\r\ncannot be too soon introduced to a knowledge of its allurements. Let\r\nus then pass in review the\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE DES ARTS ET DE LA REPUBLIQUE.[1]\r\n\r\nPreviously to the revolution, the French opera-house, under the name\r\nof _Académie Royale de Musique_, was situated on the Boulevard, near\r\nthe _Porte St. Martin_. Except the façade, which has been admired,\r\nthere was nothing very remarkable in the construction of this\r\ntheatre, but the dispatch with which it was executed.\r\n\r\nThe old opera-house in the _Palais Royal_ having been burnt down on\r\nthe 8th of June 1781, M. LENOIR, the architect, built a new one in\r\nthe short space of sixty days, and, within a fortnight after, it was\r\ndecorated and opened. Had an hospital been reduced to ashes, observes\r\nan able writer, it would have required four years at least to\r\ndetermine on the eligibility of new plans.--But a theatre,\r\nconstructed with such expedition, excited apprehensions respecting\r\nits stability: it was necessary to remove them, and, by way of\r\n_trying the house_, the first representation was given _gratis_. This\r\nhad the desired effect: after having sustained the weight of between\r\ntwo and three thousand market-women, oyster-wenches, shoe-blacks,\r\nchimney-sweepers, porters, &c, it was deemed sufficiently solid to\r\nreceive a more refined audience.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1793, the interior of this quickly-built\r\ntheatre was also destroyed by fire. But the opera experienced no\r\ninterruption: such an event would be regarded as a public calamity in\r\nthe capital. In fact, this expensive establishment affords employ to\r\na vast number of persons. The singers, dancers, musicians,\r\nmachinists, painters, tailors, dress-makers, scene-shifters, &c.\r\nattached to it, would constitute a little nation. The richness and\r\nvariety of the dresses give activity to several branches of trade,\r\nand its representations involve all the agreeable arts. These united\r\nattractions captivate foreigners, and induce them to squander\r\nconsiderable sums of money in the country. Hence, were the\r\nopera-house shut up, commerce would suffer; there would be an\r\nabsolute void in the pleasures of the Parisians; and, as experience\r\nproves, these volatile people would sooner resign every thing most\r\nvaluable than any portion of their amusements. Besides, without such\r\nan establishment, the talents of singers and dancers could not be\r\nmaintained in their present perfection. It holds out to them constant\r\nencouragement and remuneration; while, compared to any other theatre,\r\nit excites in the spectators a greater number of pleasing sensations.\r\nHow then could it be dispensed with?\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the disaster befell the theatre of the _Porte St.\r\nMartin_, it was considered as a fortunate circumstance that the\r\npresent opera-house was just finished. The performers of the\r\n_ci-devant Académie de Musique_ immediately established themselves\r\nin this new asylum, which is situated in the _Rue de la Loi_, facing\r\nthe National Library, and opened it to the public under the name of\r\n_Théâtre des Arts_. I must observe, by the way, that, in France, all\r\nplayers, dancers, musicians, and every one who exercises an art, are\r\nnow styled _artistes_.\r\n\r\nThe form of this house is nearly a parallelogram: one of the shorter\r\nsides is occupied by the stage, and the other three are slightly\r\ncurved. In general, one is ill placed here, except in the boxes in\r\nfront of the stage, and in the pit, the seats of which rise abruptly,\r\nin the manner of an amphitheatre, from the orchestra to the first\r\ntier of boxes. The Chief Consul has chosen for himself the stage-box,\r\nas I believe we term it in England, on the right hand of the actors.\r\nIt is elegantly decorated with scarlet velvet, embroidered in gold.\r\nThe ornaments (I am not speaking of the scenery) are neither of\r\nsuperlative elegance, nor do they display extraordinary taste. The\r\ncurtain, however, is majestic and beautiful, as well as the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" says a French author, \"arts, graces, genius, and taste\r\nconspire to produce a most magnificent, a most brilliant, and most\r\nenchanting spectacle. Here heroes come to life again to sing their\r\nlove and their despair; here many a goddess is seen to mix with\r\nmortals, many a Venus to descend from the radiant Olympus in order to\r\nthrow herself into the arms of more than one Anchises.\"--Certainly,\r\nif splendid decorations, rich and appropriate dresses, the most\r\nskilful machinists, the most distinguished composers, a numerous and\r\nmost select orchestra, some excellent actors, together with the most\r\ncelebrated dancers in Europe, of both sexes, constitute a brilliant\r\nspectacle, this justly deserves that title. In these magnificent\r\narrangements, we see again the Grand French Opera, as it appeared in\r\nthe most splendid days of the monarchy. With the exception of the\r\nsinging, every other department at this theatre is much improved; the\r\nonly drawback that I can discover at the representation of the same\r\npieces, which I have often seen here before the revolution, consists\r\nin the exterior of the spectators. Between the acts, when I transport\r\nmyself in idea to the former period, and, looking round the house,\r\nform a comparison, I find the republican audience far less brilliant,\r\nowing, no doubt, to the absence of that glare of diamonds,\r\nembroidery, lace, and other finery, which distinguished the\r\nfrequenters of the opera under the old government.\r\n\r\nThe performances at the opera being, in general, more calculated for\r\ncharming the eyes and ears, than gratifying the understanding, it is,\r\nconsequently, the most frequented of any of the capital.\r\n\r\n  \"-------- With the many\r\n  Action is eloquence, and th' eyes of th' ignorant\r\n  More learned than their ears.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no piece represented at this theatre that a\r\nstranger ought not to see, either on account of the music, or of the\r\nspectacle and its decorations. The operas, or lyric tragedies, which,\r\nfrom the number of times they have been performed, appear to have\r\nobtained the greatest success, are those of GLUCK. The originality,\r\nthe energy, the force and truth of declamation of this great musician\r\nwere likely to render him successful, especially among the French,\r\nwho applauded the two last-mentioned qualities on their other\r\nnational theatre.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of one only, all the works of GLUCK have remained\r\nas stock-pieces, and are played from time to time. They are five in\r\nnumber; namely, _Iphigénie en Aulide_, _Iphigénie en Tauride_,\r\n_Orphée et Euridice_, _Armide_, and _Alceste_. That which could not\r\nmaintain its ground, and consequently fell, was _Narcisse_. The\r\nflimsiness of the poem was the cause; for the music, I am assured, is\r\nthe finest that GLUCK ever composed, and several pieces of it have\r\nbeen repeatedly performed in the Parisian concerts.\r\n\r\nThe _Didon_ of PICCINI and the _OEdipe à Colonne_ of SACCHINI have\r\nhad no less success than the operas of GLUCK. They are very\r\nfrequently represented.\r\n\r\nIt may not, perhaps, be unseasonable to remind you that, from twenty\r\nto twenty-five years ago, when the old operas of LULLI and RAMEAU\r\nwere laid aside, and replaced by modern works, two parties were\r\nformed, which, from the name of the musician that each adopted, were\r\ncalled, the one, _Gluckists_; and the other, _Piccinists_. Their\r\ninveteracy was great, somewhat like that which, forty years before,\r\nexisted between the _Molinists_ and _Jansenists_: and few persons, if\r\nany, I believe, remained neuter. Victory seems to have crowned the\r\nformer party. Indeed the music of GLUCK possesses a melody which is\r\nwonderfully energetic and striking. PICCINI is skilful and brilliant\r\nin his harmony, as well as sweet and varied in his composition; but\r\nthis style of beauty has been thought to be deficient in expression.\r\nTruth obliges me to say, that, of PICCINI'S works, no opera is now\r\nplayed but his _Didon_, and that his other productions, which, to the\r\nbest of my recollection, are _Alys_, an opera called _Iphigénie en\r\nTauride_, and _Pénélope_, have fallen. This was ascribed to the\r\nmediocrity of the language; a part of an opera somewhat essential,\r\nthough no great attention seems to be bestowed on it. But if people\r\nhere are not very difficult as to the style of the language, they\r\nrequire at least an action well conducted and interesting. When the\r\npiece is of itself cold, it is not in the power of the finest music\r\nto give it warmth. The _OEdipe à Colonne_ of SACCHINI is reckoned by\r\nmany persons the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of operas. That able musician has\r\nthere excelled in all that is graceful, noble, and pathetic; but it\r\nexhibits not the tragic fire that is to be found in the works of\r\nGLUCK. SACCHINI has left behind him another composition, called\r\n_Arvire et Evéline_, which, though a cold subject, taken from the\r\nhistory of England, is held in estimation.\r\n\r\nAt this theatre are also performed what the French term _opéras de\r\ngenre_. These are a species of comic opera, in which is introduced a\r\ngreat deal of show and bustle. _Panurge_, _La Caravanne_, _Anacréon_,\r\n_Tarare_, _Les Prétendus_, _Les Mystères d'Isis_, &c. are of this\r\ndescription. The music of the first three is by GRÉTRY. It is\r\nconsidered as replete with grace, charm, and truth of expression. The\r\npoem of _Panurge_ is an _estravaganza_. Those of the _Caravanne_ and\r\nof _Anacréon_ are but indifferent. It required no small share of\r\ntalent to put words into the mouth of the charming poet, whose name\r\nis given to the last-mentioned piece; but M. GUY appears not to have\r\nthought of this. _Tarare_ is a tissue of improbabilities and\r\nabsurdities. The poem is frequently nothing but an assemblage of\r\nwords which present no meaning. It is a production of the celebrated\r\nBEAUMARCHAIS, who has contrived to introduce into it a sort of\r\nimpious metaphysics, much in fashion here before the revolution. The\r\nmusic is by SALIERI; it is very agreeable. The decorations are\r\nbrilliant and diversified. The piece is preceded by a prologue (which\r\nno other opera has) representing the confusion and separation of the\r\nelements; and at the time of its first appearance, I remember it was\r\nsaid that chaos was the image of the author's head.\r\n\r\n_Les Prétendus_ is a piece in one act, the plot of which is weak,\r\nthough of a gay cast. The music is charming. It is by LE MOYNE, who\r\ndied a few years ago, at an early period of life. _Les Mystères\r\nd'Isis_, which is now the rage, is an incoherent parody from a German\r\nopera, called _the Enchanted Flute_. To say that the music is by\r\nMOZART, dispenses me from any eulogium. The decorations are extremely\r\nbeautiful and varied: a scene representing paradise is really\r\nenchanting.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of lyric tragedies, I should have mentioned those\r\nwhich are either in rehearsal, or intended to be brought forward at\r\nthis theatre. They consist of _Hécube_, _Andromaque_, _Sémiramis_,\r\nand _Tamerlan_. Although none of them are spoken of very highly, they\r\nwill, in all probability, succeed in a certain degree; for a piece\r\nscarcely ever has a complete fall at the opera. This theatre has so\r\nmany resources in the decorations, music, and dancing, that a new\r\npiece is seldom destitute of something worth seeing.\r\n\r\nWhat, at the present day, proves the greatest attraction to the\r\nopera, is the dancing. How bad soever may be a piece, when it is\r\ninterspersed with fine ballets, it is sure of having a certain run.\r\nOf these I shall say no more till I come to speak of that department.\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the performances at the opera is the singing. All\r\nare agreed as to the mediocrity of the singers at this theatre,\r\ncalled _lyric_. No one can say that, within the last ten or twelve\r\nyears, they are improved. To any person fond of the Italian style, it\r\nwould be a sort of punishment to attend while some of the singers\r\nhere go through a scene. On the stage of the French comic opera, it\r\nhas been adopted, and here also a similar change is required; but\r\nwith the will to accomplish it, say its partisans, the means,\r\nperhaps, might still be wanting. The greater part of the old\r\nperformers have lost their voice, and those who have not, do not\r\nappear to have sufficiently followed the progress of modern taste to\r\nbe able all at once to embrace a new manner.\r\n\r\nThe first singer at the opera, in point of talent, is LAÏS. He even\r\nleaves all the others far behind him, if we consider him only as a\r\nsinger. He is a _tenore_, according to the expression of the\r\nItalians, and a _taille_, according to that of the French: in the\r\n_cantabile_ or graceful style, he is perfect; but he ought to avoid\r\ntragic pieces requiring exertion, in which his voice, though\r\nflexible, is sometimes disagreeable, and even harsh. Besides, he is\r\nabsolutely deficient in nobleness of manner; and his stature and\r\ncountenance are better suited to low character. Indeed, he chiefly\r\nperforms in the operas termed here _opéras de genre_, such as\r\n_Panurge_, _La Caravanne_, _Anacréon_, and _Les Prétendus_. In these,\r\nhis acting is correct, and his delivery judicious.\r\n\r\nLAÏS is no less famous for the violence of his political opinions\r\nthan for his talents as a singer. At the period when the abettors of\r\nthe reign of terror were, in their turn, hunted down, for a long time\r\nhe durst not appear on the stage. He was accused by his brother\r\nperformers of having said that the opera would never go on well till\r\na guillotine should be placed on the stage. This stroke was levelled\r\nagainst the greater part of the actors and the musicians belonging to\r\nthe orchestra. However, as LAÏS could not be reproached with any\r\nculpable _actions_, he found zealous defenders, and the public\r\nsacrificed their resentment to their pleasure. This lenity appears\r\nnot to have had on him the effect which one would imagine. He still\r\npossesses every requisite for singing well, but seems indifferent as\r\nto the means of pleasing, and exerts himself but little.\r\n\r\nIf singers were esteemed by seniority, and perhaps by employment,\r\nLAINEZ would be reckoned the first at this theatre. He is a\r\ncounter-tenor, and performs the parts of a lover. His voice is very\r\nstrong, and, besides singing through his nose, he screams loud enough\r\nto split one's ears. I have already observed that the ears of a\r\ntasteful amateur would sometimes be shocked at this theatre. The\r\nsame remark, no doubt, was equally just some time ago; for J. J.\r\nROUSSEAU, when he was told that it was intended to restore to him\r\nthe free admission which he had enjoyed at the opera, replied that\r\nthis was unnecessary, because he had at the door of his\r\ncountry-residence the screech owls of the forest of Montmorency.\r\nThose who are partial to LAINEZ think him an excellent actor. This\r\nmeans that he has some warmth, and bestirs himself like a demoniac.\r\nWhen the heroes of the opera wore hair-powder, nothing was more\r\ncomic than to see him shake his head, which was instantly enveloped\r\nin a cloud of dust. At this signal the plaudits burst forth with\r\ngreat violence, and the would-be singer, screaming with still\r\ngreater loudness, seemed on the point of bursting a blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that, not long since, a great personage having sent\r\nfor the _artists_ belonging to the opera, said to them, addressing\r\nhimself to LAINEZ, \"Gentlemen, do you intend to keep long your old\r\nsingers?\"[2] The same personage then turning round to the dancers\r\nadded, \"As for you, gentlemen of the dance, none but compliments can\r\nbe paid to you.\"\r\n\r\nLAFORÊT who (as the French express it), _doubles_ LAINEZ, that is,\r\nperforms the same characters in his absence, has little more to\r\nrecommend him than his zeal. His voice is tolerably agreeable, but\r\nnot strong enough for so large a house. As an actor he is cold and\r\naukward.\r\n\r\nNext comes CHÉRON: he sings bass. His voice is strong, and the tone\r\nof it sonorous and clear. However, it is thought to be weakened, and\r\nalthough this singer sometimes throws out fine tones, he is\r\nreproached with a want of taste and method. He is a sorry actor.\r\nIndeed, he very seldom makes his appearance, which some attribute to\r\nidleness; and others, to his state of health. The latter is likely to\r\nbe occasionally deranged, as in point of epicurism, he has as great a\r\nreputation as our celebrated Quin.\r\n\r\nADRIEN, who _doubles_ CHÉRON, is an excellent actor; but his means do\r\nnot equal his intelligence. He presents himself wonderfully well; all\r\nhis movements, all his gestures have dignity, grace, and ease. There\r\nare, for the same employment, other secondary singers, some of whom\r\nare by no means backward in exertion, particularly DUFRESNE; but an\r\nimpartial observer can say nothing more in their commendation.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the qualifications of _Mesdames les cantatrices_.\r\n\r\nThe first female singer at the opera is Mademoiselle MAILLARD. By\r\nmeans of a rather pretty face, a clear voice, and a cabal of\r\nmalcontents (for there are some every where and in every line), she\r\nobtained loud applause, when she first appeared some years ago as the\r\nrival of the charming ST. HUBERTI. Since the revolution, France has\r\nlost this celebrated actress, and probably for ever. She emigrated,\r\nand has since married the _ci-devant_ Comte d'Antraigues. Although\r\nshe had not a powerful voice, she sang with the greatest perfection;\r\nand her impressive and dignified style of acting was at least equal\r\nto her singing.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, Mademoiselle MAILLARD has succeeded Madame ST.\r\nHUBERTI, and is, as I have said, the first singer, in point of rank.\r\nShe is become enormous in bulk, and as the Italians express it,\r\n_canta a salti_. Her powerful voice fills the house, but she is not\r\nunfrequently out of tune: her declamation is noisy; while her\r\nmasculine person gives her in all her motions the air of a Bacchante.\r\nThese qualities, no doubt, recommended her to the notice of\r\nCHAUMETTE, the proclaimer of atheism, under whose auspices she more\r\nthan once figured as the goddess of reason. She has, nevertheless,\r\noccasionally distinguished herself as an actress; and those who love\r\nnoise, admire the effect of her transitions. But I give the\r\npreference to Mademoiselle LATOUR, who has a melodious pipe, which\r\nyou will probably hear, as it is said that she has not retired from\r\nthe stage, where she frequently reminded the public of the\r\nfascinating ST. HUBERTI, particularly in the character of _Didon_.\r\n\r\nSince the prolonged absence of Mademoiselle LATOUR, Madame BRANCHU\r\n_doubles_ Mademoiselle MAILLARD. She is of much promise both as a\r\nsinger and actress. Her voice is agreeable, but not extensive.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle ARMAND is another most promising singer, who has a more\r\npowerful organ than Madame BRANCHU, and when she has perfectly\r\nacquired the art of modulating it, will, doubtless, prove a very\r\nvaluable acquisition to this theatre. Her voice has much sweetness,\r\nand sometimes conveys to the ear the most flattering sounds, as its\r\nlow tones are grave without being harsh, and its high ones sonorous\r\nwithout being sharp. She seems to execute the most difficult pieces\r\nof music with considerable ease; but she is deficient in action.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle HENRY is strong as to method, but weak as to means, in\r\nsinging. There are several other female singers; but, in my opinion,\r\ntheir merits do not entitle them to particular mention.\r\n\r\nTwelve or fourteen years ago, the opera was much better provided with\r\nsingers than it is at the present moment. Their voices, in every line\r\nof this department, were well-toned and powerful. They easily reached\r\nthe highest notes according to the tone given by the diapason. Since\r\nthen, the powers of most of the singers who still remain on the stage\r\nhave diminished, and those called in to supply the place of such as\r\nare dead or have retired, are not near so rich in voice as their\r\npredecessors. The diapason, however, has remained the same: to this,\r\nin a great measure, may be attributed those shrieks and efforts which\r\ndisgust foreigners, unaccustomed to the French method. At the\r\nParisian comic opera, in consequence of a remonstrance from the\r\nprincipal singers, their diapason has been lowered half a tone; and\r\nit seems necessary to examine whether the same rule be not applicable\r\nto this theatre.\r\n\r\nThe choruses, notwithstanding, are now given here with more effect\r\nand precision than I ever remember at any former period. In these,\r\nthe ear is no longer offended by exaggerated extensions of the voice,\r\nand, on the whole, they are sung in a grand and graceful style.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra, which is ably led by REY, has also experienced a\r\nmanifest improvement. The principal musicians, I understand, have\r\nbeen recently changed; and the first artists are engaged for the\r\nexecution of the solos, and nothing can now be wished for, either as\r\nto the spirit and correctness of the overtures, or to the melody and\r\ntaste of the accompaniments.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Consul is said to be particularly partial to Italian music.\r\nIn consequence, KREUTZER, a capital violin, and also a celebrated\r\ncomposer, has been dispatched to Italy by the French government, for\r\nthe express purpose of selecting and purchasing the finest musical\r\ncompositions which can be procured in that land of harmony. Thus, the\r\nadvice given by ROUSSEAU, in his _Dictionnaire de Musique_, has at\r\nlength been followed.\r\n\r\nSo much for the singing department of the opera, which, as you see,\r\nwith some exceptions, is but indifferent: in my next, I shall speak\r\nof the dancing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above letter was written, this Lyric theatre\r\nhas changed its name for that of _Théâtre de l'Opéra_. This seems\r\nlike one of the minor modifications, announcing the general\r\nretrograde current setting towards the readoption of old habits; for\r\nthe denomination of _Théâtre des Arts_ was certainly unobjectionable,\r\nas poetry, music, dancing, painting, and mechanics, concurred in\r\nrendering more pompous and more surprising the effects which a\r\nfertile genius, when governed by reason, might assemble here for the\r\ngratification of the public. The addition of the words _et de la\r\nRépublique_ was probably given to it from patriotic zeal, at the time\r\nwhen the _Royal Academy of Music_ was abolished by the decree which\r\nannihilated all similar monarchical institutions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It appears that, from pique, this old opera-singer\r\nrefused to sing on Easter-Sunday last, (1802) at the cathedral of\r\n_Notre-Dame_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 30, 1801_.\r\n\r\nDancing, like the other arts in France, has, during the revolution,\r\nexperienced the vicissitudes of this new order of things; but also,\r\nlike the other arts, it has made a progress equally astonishing and\r\nrapid. However, it must not thence be inferred that dancing,\r\nparticularly theatrical, had not attained a certain degree of\r\nsuperiority long before the revolution; yet a most evident\r\nimprovement has been made in it, not only by the old-established\r\ndancers, who then seemed almost to have done their best, but by the\r\nnumerous competitors who have since made their appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the power of words to convey an adequate idea of the\r\neffect produced on the senses by some of the ballets. In lieu of\r\nthose whimsical capers, forced attitudes, vague and undefined\r\ngestures of a set of dancers whose movements had no signification,\r\ndancing now forms an animated, graceful, and diversified picture, in\r\nwhich all the human passions are feelingly pourtrayed. Their language\r\nis the more expressive from its being more refined and concentrated.\r\nIn the silence of pantomime, recourse is had to every ingenious\r\ngesture, in order to impart to them greater force and energy; and, in\r\nthis mute play, restraint seems to kindle eloquence. Every motion has\r\nits meaning; the foot speaks as well as the eye, and the sensations\r\nof the mind are expressed by the attitudes of the body. A delicate\r\nsentiment is rendered with the rapidity of lightning. Love, fear,\r\nhope, and despair, change countenances, and say every thing that they\r\nwish to say, void of deceit, as if falsehood no longer existed as\r\nsoon as the mouth ceased to open.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that it was NOVERRE who first brought\r\nabout in France this reform in what were till then called ballets,\r\nwithout deserving the title. He banished wigs, hoop-petticoats, and\r\nother preposterous habiliments, and, by dint of superior genius,\r\nseconded by taste and perseverance, introduced those historical\r\npictures, replete with grace, expression, and sentiment, in the room\r\nof the flat, insipid, and lifeless caricatures, which had hitherto\r\nusurped admiration.\r\n\r\nBut, though NOVERRE, and, after him, the GARDELS, introduced on the\r\nParisian stage the pantomimic art in all the lustre in which it\r\nflourished on the theatres of Greece and Rome, yet they had been\r\nanticipated by HILWERDING in Germany, and ANGIOLINI in Italy, two\r\ncelebrated men, who, in a distinguished manner, laid the foundations\r\nof a species of modern entertainment, before known only by the annals\r\nof ancient history. Those who have trod in their steps have\r\ninfinitely surpassed them in attractions, and, by their scientific\r\ncompositions, acquired a justly-merited reputation.\r\n\r\nGARDEL, who, for the last fifteen years, has been the first dancer at\r\nthe opera, shews himself but seldom. After having, during that long\r\nperiod, received the warmest and best deserved applause, either in\r\nthe execution of the noble style of dancing, or in the composition of\r\nballets, he seems now to have devoted himself almost exclusively to\r\nthe last-mentioned branch of his art, and the perfection to which he\r\ndaily carries it, may well compensate the public for the privation of\r\nhis talents in the line of execution.\r\n\r\nThe most famous pantomimical ballets or _ballets d'action_ (as they\r\nare styled) now represented here, are _Psyché_, _Télémaque_, _Le\r\nJugement de Paris_, _Mirza_, and _la Dansomanie_. The impression to\r\nwhich I have before alluded, is particularly observable during the\r\nrepresentation of the first three (composed by GARDEL), the charm of\r\nwhich would be weakened by any attempt at description. No spectator,\r\nbe his disposition ever so cold and indifferent, can behold them\r\nunmoved. Every effort of human skill and invention is exerted to\r\nexcite astonishment and admiration. The _ensemble_ of the _spectacle_\r\nand decorations correspond to the fertile genius of the author. It is\r\nthe triumph of the art, and there may be fixed the limits of\r\npantomime, embellished by dancing. Nothing more perfect than the\r\nrapid change of scenery. Meteors, apparitions, divinities borne on\r\nclusters of clouds or in cars, appear and disappear, as if by\r\nenchantment, exhibiting situations the most picturesque and striking.\r\n\r\nBOULAY, the principal machinist, is, perhaps, the first in his line\r\nin Europe. In the opera of _Armide_, I have seen him raise into the\r\nair nearly one half of the theatre. He executes whatever is proposed\r\nto him, no matter how difficult, and he is well seconded by the\r\npainters and draughtsmen. The new decorations display much taste, and\r\nproduce an effect truly wonderful.\r\n\r\nHad I not already made the remark, you might have concluded from the\r\ngeneral tenour of my observations, that the dancing forms the most\r\nbrilliant part, of the _spectacle_ at this theatre, or, in other\r\nwords, that the accessory prevails over the main subject. It is no\r\nlonger, as heretofore, a few capital dancers of both sexes who form\r\nthe ornament of the opera. Almost all the competitors in this line\r\nare so many _virtuosi_ who deserve and equally participate the\r\nplaudits of the public. There is not among them any mediocrity. The\r\nestablishment of the _école de la danse_ is for this theatre a\r\nnursery, where Terpsichore finds, in great numbers, the most\r\npromising plants for the decoration of her temple. It is saying\r\nlittle to affirm that nothing equals the superiority of talents of\r\nthis description which the opera comprehends at the present moment.\r\nThese advantages, I understand, are chiefly due to GARDEL. He has\r\ngiven the example and the precept, and, through his guidance, the art\r\nof dancing is become doubly captivating.\r\n\r\nAfter having supplied most of the principal cities in Europe with\r\ncapital dancers, this theatre, far from being impoverished, is still\r\nin possession of a numerous train of first-rate _artists_ of both\r\nsexes in every style of dancing. The men are GARDEL, MILON, ST.\r\nAMAND, DESHAIES, GOYON, BEAUPRÉ, BRANCHU, BEAULIEU, AUMER, LÉON,\r\nTAGLIONI, DUPORT, and VESTRIS.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to speak of the talents of VESTRIS, as they are as\r\nwell known in London as in Paris. I shall therefore content myself\r\nwith remarking that he delights in exhibiting feats of agility; but\r\nas his age increases, connoisseurs think that he declines a little.\r\nNevertheless, he is still, in reality, the first dancer at the opera.\r\nIt is said that his son, ARMAND VESTRIS, will, in time, be able to\r\nsupply his place; in the mean while, DUPORT bids fair to fill it, in\r\ncase the \"_Dieu de la danse_\" should retire; not to mention DESHAIES,\r\nwho has lately met with an accident which has disabled him for the\r\npresent; but who, when on the stage in the presence of Vestris, has\r\nshewn that he could also astonish and delight the spectators. Without\r\nhaving the boldness of his rival, he exhibits more certainty and\r\n_à-plomb_. In the character of _Télémaque_, he appears with all the\r\ngrace of Apollo. If excellence in dancing be allowed to consist less\r\nin the efforts of the dancer, than in the ease and gracefulness of\r\nhis attitudes, and the lightness and precision of his steps, DESHAIES\r\nmay he classed in the first rank of his profession.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, as in every thing else, there is a just medium, and\r\nthis is more particularly observed by the principal female dancers.\r\nThe names of these are GARDEL, CLOTILDE, CHEVIGNY, PÉRIGNON, COLLOMB,\r\nCHAMEROI,[1] SAULNIER, VESTRIS, DELISLE, MILLIÈRE, LOUISE, FÉLICITÉ,\r\nDUPORT, TAGLIONI, ALINE, ÉTIENNE, JACOTOT, FLORINE, ADÈLE, to whom\r\nmay be added two most promising _débutantes_, LA NEUVILLE and\r\nBIGOTINI, whose first appearance I witnessed.\r\n\r\nThough Madame GARDEL, wife of the principal ballet-master, shines in\r\n_demi-caractère_, her talents, in the different parts in which she is\r\nplaced, are above all panegyric. As NOVERRE has said somewhere of a\r\nfamous dancer, \"she is always tender, always graceful, sometimes a\r\nbutterfly, sometimes a zephyr, at one moment inconstant, at another\r\nfaithful; always animated by a new sentiment, she represents with\r\nvoluptuousness all the shades of love.\" To sum up her merits, she is\r\nreally in her art the female Proteus of the lyric scene. Mademoiselle\r\nCLOTILDE is a tall, elegant woman, who dances in the serious style.\r\nAll her movements, made with precision, exhibit the beautiful\r\nproportion of her finely-modelled figure; but, owing to her stature,\r\nshe appears to most advantage in pantomime, particularly in the\r\ncharacter of _Calypso_ in the ballet of _Télémaque_. In the same\r\nballet, MILLIÈRE, in the part of _Eucharis_, displays her playful\r\ngraces and engaging mien. CHEVIGNY is full of expression in\r\npantomime, and dances in great perfection, notwithstanding her\r\n_embonpoint_. PÉRIGNON and COLLOMB are superior in the comic style,\r\nand all the others are not without some peculiar exellence.[2]\r\n\r\nI should never finish, were I to attempt to particularize the merits\r\nof all these fascinating women, who, as well as the men, have, of\r\nlate, alternately interchanged the characters they performed in the\r\nballets of action. Even those introduced occasionally in the fêtes\r\ngiven and received by the heroes in the different operas, present a\r\nreal contest, in which the first-rate dancers of both sexes exert\r\nthemselves to snatch the palm from their rivals. When a theatre\r\npossesses such a richness, variety, and assemblage of talents in the\r\nsame art, it may boldly stylo itself the first in Europe. But I must\r\nconfess that an innovation has been introduced here which detracts\r\nmuch from what has always been considered as fine dancing. I mean the\r\nmania of _pirouettes_. This, however, seems less to be attributed to\r\na decided _penchant_ of the dancers than to that of a new public, not\r\nyet familiarized to what constitutes true taste.\r\n\r\nDuring a revolution, every thing changes, every thing assumes a new\r\nface. What was entitled to please yesterday in times of tranquillity,\r\nis to-day, during the jar of public opinion, and will be to-morrow\r\nsubject to all the variations of caprice. The marvellous and gigantic\r\nusurp the place of the natural, and claim alone the right to\r\nentertain. True it is that the dancers have found means to render\r\nthis new manner interesting, while they have enjoyed the sweets of\r\nit. The pleasure of being applauded is so great, that it is no easy\r\nmatter to withstand the powerful allurement of the plaudits of a\r\nnumerous audience. Boileau has said, \"_Aimez-vous la muscade? On en a\r\nmis par tout_.\" The French dancers, following his example, have said,\r\n\"_Aimez-vous les pirouettes?_\" The public have answered _oui_; and\r\n_pirouettes_ are all the rage.\r\n\r\nWhen a certain king of Bisnagar sneezes, the court, the town, the\r\nprovinces, all the subjects of his empire, in short, sneeze in\r\nimitation of their monarch. Without departing from my subject, I\r\nshall only observe that _pirouettes_, like this sneezing, have found\r\ntheir way from the opera-stage into the circles of every class of\r\nsociety in Paris. There lies the absurdity. The young Frenchmen have\r\nbeen emulous to dance like dancers by profession; the women have had\r\nthe same ambition; and both men and women have, above all, been\r\ndesirous to shine like them in _pirouettes_. Thence most of the\r\ndances, formerly practised in society, in which simple and natural\r\ngrace was combined with a certain facility and nobleness of\r\nexecution, have been entirely laid aside. It must be acknowledged,\r\nthat, among the dancers in private company, there are many, indeed,\r\nwho, by dint of imitation and study, have attained a great degree of\r\nperfection. But I now perceive that people here no longer dance for\r\ntheir amusement; they dance to gratify their vanity, and many a\r\nperson who has not practised some hours in the morning under the\r\ntuition of his master, excuses himself in the evening, pretends to be\r\nlame, and declines dancing.\r\n\r\nThe taste and elegance of the dresses of the opera-dancers, like\r\nthose of the heroes and heroines of the sock and buskin, leave\r\nnothing to be wished for. In lieu of drawers, which all women,\r\nwithout exception, were formerly obliged to wear on the stage[3],\r\nthose who dance have now substituted silk pantaloons, woven with\r\nfeet, in order to serve also as stockings. In some particular\r\ncharacters, they wear these of flesh colour, and it is not then easy,\r\nat first sight, to distinguish whether it be or be not the clothing\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nThe French opera having been long considered as the grand national\r\ntheatre, it has ever been the pride of the government, whether\r\nmonarchical or republican, to support it in a manner worthy of the\r\nnation. In fact, the disbursements are so great, that it would be\r\nimpossible for the receipts to cover them, though the performances\r\nare seldom suspended for more than two days in the week, and the\r\nhouse is generally crowded. This theatre is managed by the\r\ngovernment, and on its account. The Minister of the Interior appoints\r\na commissioner to superintend its operations, and managers to conduct\r\nthem. During the old _régime_, the opera cost the crown annually from\r\none hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres. What the\r\nextraordinary expenses of this house are, under the present\r\ngovernment, is not so easily ascertained; but, from the best\r\ninformation that I have been able to procure, their amount is from\r\nthree to four hundred thousand francs a year. Here is a considerable\r\nincrease; but it must be remembered that the price of several\r\narticles is now greatly augmented, if not doubled.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of the opera, on an average, used to be from twelve to\r\nfifteen thousand livres a night; what it is at this day, is not\r\npositively known. Formerly, the produce of the boxes, let by the\r\nyear, was such, that nine thousand livres were paid, in a manner,\r\nbefore the doors were thrown open. That resource is almost void at\r\npresent; nevertheless, this house being more spacious than the old\r\none, the prices of admission higher, and the performance, perhaps,\r\nmore constantly attended, the money taken at the door cannot well be\r\nless than it was formerly. It then cost much less than it does now to\r\nbring out a new piece. Thirty or forty thousand livres were\r\nsufficient for the production of the most magnificent opera; while\r\nthe disbursements to be made for _Tamerlan_ will, it is thought,\r\namount to upwards of eighty thousand francs. At this rate, the first\r\nrepresentation of the _Mystères d'Isis_, of which so much has been\r\nsaid, must have been attended with an expense of more than a hundred\r\nthousand. Scandal whispers, that the managers of the opera are rather\r\npartial to expensive pieces; but as they are accountable for their\r\nconduct to the Minister of the Interior, I should presume that they\r\nmust act as honourable men.\r\n\r\nThe salaries are not considerable at this theatre. The first\r\nperformers have not more than twelve thousand francs a year,\r\nexclusively of the _feux_, which is the sum given to each of them,\r\nwhen they perform. This, I understand, does not exceed a louis a\r\nnight. Those who have a name, indemnify themselves by going, from\r\ntime to time, to play in the great commercial towns of the\r\ndepartments, such as Bordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, &c. where they\r\ngenerally collect a rich harvest. It is said that VESTRIS has\r\nreceived from the government a gratification to prevent him from\r\nvisiting the British metropolis; and it is also reported that DIDELOT\r\nand LABORIE have made vain efforts to return to the Parisian opera;\r\nbut that the managers, faithful to their instructions, refuse to\r\nreadmit such of the old performers as have voluntarily quitted it.\r\nWhat attaches performers to the opera-house is the _pension de\r\nretraite._ They all eventually obtain it, even the chorus-singers.\r\n\r\nThe remuneration of authors, that is, of the poet and composer of the\r\nmusic, is to each three hundred francs for every representation, when\r\nthe piece is not less than three acts. This is the most common\r\ndivision. I know of no operas in one act; those in two are paid in\r\nthe above proportion.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: GARDEL has lately added another sprig of laurel to his\r\nbrow, by the production of a new pantomimical ballet, called _Daphnis\r\net Pandrose, ou la vengeance de l'amour_. He has borrowed the subject\r\nfrom a story of Madame DE GENLIS, who took it from fable. Every\r\nresource of his inexhaustible genius has been employed to give the\r\nhappiest effect to this charming work, to enumerate the beauties of\r\nwhich is, by general report, beyond the powers of language. All the\r\nfirst-rate dancers of both sexes are placed in the most advantageous\r\npoint of view throughout this ballet. Madame GARDEL performs in it\r\nthe part of Cupid, with all the charms, wiles, and graces which poets\r\nascribe to the roguish deity. The other characters are represented in\r\na manner no less interesting. In short, music, dancing, pantomime,\r\ndress, decoration, every thing in this piece, concurs to stamp it as\r\none of the most wonderful productions of the kind ever exhibited to\r\nthe admiration of the public.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In a preceding note, VESTRIS has been mentioned as the\r\nreputed lover of Mademoiselle CHAMEROI, and from this instance of\r\nillicit intercourse, it might, perhaps, be erroneously inferred that\r\nmost of the Parisian female opera-dancers had overleaped the pale of\r\nvirtue. Without pretending to enter the lists as the champion of\r\ntheir character, though I admire their talents as warmly as any\r\namateur, truth induces me to observe that many of these ladies enjoy\r\nan unblemished reputation. Madame VESTRIS, in particular, is\r\nuniversally represented as a young and pretty woman, much attached to\r\nher faithless husband, and, notwithstanding his improper example, a\r\nconstant observer of the most exemplary conduct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Many years ago, a Parisian actress, coming on the stage\r\nin the part of _Mérope_, in the tragedy of that name, her petticoats\r\nsomehow happened to catch in the side-scene, and, in her hasty\r\nendeavours to disentangle them, she exhibited to the audience the\r\nhind part of her person. In consequence of this accident, a _sentence\r\nde police_ enjoined every woman, whether actress or dancer, not to\r\nappear on the boards of any theatre, without drawers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The refusal made by the Rector of St. Roch to admit into\r\nthat church the corpse of Mademoiselle CHAMEROI, has informed us in\r\nEngland of the loss which this theatre has sustained in that young\r\nand accomplished dancer. She died, generally regretted, in\r\nconsequence of being delivered of a child of which VESTRIS considered\r\nhimself as the real father. However, M. DE MARKOFF, the Russian\r\nambassador at Paris, stood sponsor to the infant, and, according to\r\nthe scandalous chronicle, was not contented with being only a\r\nspiritual father. The Parisian public have consoled themselves for\r\nthis loss by talking a great deal about the scene to which it gave\r\nrise. It seems that the Rector was decidedly in the wrong, the\r\ndancers of the opera never having been comprised in the papal\r\nexcommunication which involved players. The persons composing the\r\nfuneral procession were also in the wrong to go to St. Roch, since\r\nthe Rector had positively declared that the corpse of Mademoiselle\r\nCHAMEROI should not enter the church.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 1, 1802._\r\n\r\nFast locked in the arms of Morpheus, and not dreaming of what was to\r\nhappen, as Lord North said, when the king caused him to be awakened,\r\nin the dead of the night, to deliver up the seals, so was I roused\r\nthis morning by a message from an amiable French lady of my\r\nacquaintance, requesting me to send her some _bonbons_. \"_Bonbons_!\"\r\nexclaimed I, \"in the name of wonder, Rosalie, is your mistress so\r\nchildishly impatient as to send you trailing through the snow, on\r\npurpose to remind me that I promised to replenish her\r\n_bonbonnière_?\"--\"Not exactly so, Monsieur,\" replied the _femme de\r\nchambre_, \"Madame was willing to be the first to wish you a happy new\r\nyear.\"--\"A new year!\" said I, \"by the republican calendar, I thought\r\nthat the new year began on the 1st of Vendémiaire.\"--\"Very true,\"\r\nanswered she; \"but, in spite of new laws, people adhere to old\r\ncustoms; wherefore we celebrate the first of January.\"--\"As to\r\ncelebrating the first of January, _à la bonne heure_, Rosalie,\"\r\nrejoined I, \"I have no sort of objection; but I wish you had adhered\r\nto some of your other old customs, and, above all, to your old hours.\r\nI was not in bed till past six o'clock this morning, and now, you\r\nwake me at eight with your congratulations.\"--\"Never mind, Monsieur,\"\r\nsaid she, \"you will soon drop asleep again; but my mistress hopes\r\nthat you will not fail to make one of her party on the _Fête des\r\nRois_.\"--\"Good heaven!\" exclaimed I again, \"what, is a\r\ncounterrevolution at hand, that the _Fête des Rois_ must also be\r\ncelebrated?\"--\"'Tis,\" interrupted Rosalie, \"only for the pleasure of\r\ndrawing for king and queen.\"--\"Tell Madame,\" added I, \"that I will\r\naccept her invitation.\"--Dismissing the _soubrette_ with this\r\nassurance, at the same time not forgetting to present her with a new\r\nyear's gift, she at once revealed the secret of her early visit, by\r\nhinting to me that, among intimate friends, it was customary to give\r\n_étrennes_. This, in plain English, implies nothing more nor less\r\nthan that I must likewise make her mistress a present, on the\r\nprinciple, I suppose, that _les petits cadeaux entretiennent\r\nl'amitié_.\r\n\r\nMy reflection then turned on the instability of this people. After\r\nestablishing a new division of time, they return to the old one, and\r\ncelebrate, as formerly, the first of January. Now, it is evident that\r\nthe former accords better with the order of nature, and that autumn\r\nwas the first season which followed the creation. Why else should\r\napples of irresistible ripeness and beauty have presented themselves\r\nto the eye of our first parents in the garden of Eden? This would not\r\nhave been the case, had the world commenced in winter.\r\n\r\nBesides, a multitude of advantages would accrue to the French from an\r\nadherence to the 1st of Vendémiaire, or 23d of September of the\r\nGregorian calendar, as the first day of the year. The weather, after\r\nthe autumnal equinox, is generally settled, in consequence of the air\r\nhaving been purified by the pre-existing gales, the ordinary\r\nforerunners of that period: and the Parisians would not be obliged to\r\nbrave the rain, the wind, the cold, the frost, the snow, &c. in going\r\nto wish a happy new year to their fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts,\r\ncousins, and other relations. For to all this are they now exposed,\r\nunless they choose to ruin themselves in coach-hire. The consequence\r\nis that they are wet, cold, and dirty for two or three successive\r\ndays, and are sure to suffer by a sore throat, rheumatism, or fever,\r\nall which entail the expensive attendance of the faculty; whereas,\r\ndid they celebrate the 23d of September as new year's day, they\r\nmight, in a quiet, unassuming manner, pay all their visits on foot,\r\nand, in that season, this exercise would neither be prejudicial to\r\ntheir purse nor their health.\r\n\r\nI do not immediately recollect whether I have spoken to you of the\r\nlong-expected account of the French expedition to Egypt, by DENON:\r\nyet I ought not to have omitted to inform you that, upwards of two\r\nmonths ago, I set down your name for a copy of this splendid work. It\r\nwill cost you 360 francs; but you will have one of the proof\r\nimpressions. I have seen a specimen of the letter-press, which is to\r\nconsist of a folio volume, printed by Didot. The plates, amounting to\r\nupwards of one hundred and forty in number, are entirely engraved\r\nfrom DENON'S original drawings, without any reduction or enlargement,\r\nwith the exception of that representing the Battle of the Pyramids,\r\nthe size of which has been increased at the express desire of\r\nBONAPARTE. I have often amused myself on a morning in contemplating\r\nthese drawings; but the crowd of curious persons being generally\r\ngreat, I determined to seize the opportunity of examining them more\r\nat leisure to-day, when the French are entirely engaged in\r\ninterchanging the compliments of the season. I found DENON himself\r\ndiligently employed on some of the engravings; and so anxious is he\r\nfor the publication of the work, that he toils early and late to\r\nforward its appearance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the anxiety he feels on that account, this estimable\r\nartist takes a real pleasure in explaining the subject of his\r\ndrawings; and, by means of his obliging communications, I am now\r\nbecome tolerably well acquainted with Egypt. What country, in fact,\r\nhas a better claim to fix attention than that which served as a\r\ncradle to human knowledge, and the history of which goes back to the\r\nfirst ages of the world; a country, where every thing seems to have\r\ncommenced? Laws, arts, sciences, and even fables, which derive their\r\norigin from nature, whose attributes they immortalize, and which, at\r\na subsequent period, formed the ground-work of the ingenious fictions\r\nof mythology.\r\n\r\nWhat idea must we not conceive of the industry and civilization of a\r\npeople who erected those celebrated monuments, anterior to the annals\r\nof history, to the accounts even of tradition, those pyramids which\r\nhave unalterably withstood all the ravages of time?\r\n\r\nWhen we look back on the ancients, the Greeks and Romans almost\r\nexclusively divide our attention. The former, it is true, carried\r\nfarther the love and the culture of the fine arts; while the latter\r\nare more remarkable for the great traits of their character; though\r\nboth acquired that renown which mankind have so improperly attached\r\nto the success of arms.\r\n\r\nBut, in allowing to Greece all the interest which she claims, in so\r\nmany respects, we cannot forget that she was originally peopled by\r\nEgyptian colonies; that it was Egyptians who, in later times, carried\r\nthither the knowledge of the arts, the most necessary and the most\r\nindispensable to society; and that, at the epoch which preceded the\r\nsplendid days of Greece, it was also into Egypt that the sages went\r\nto acquire that knowledge of a superior kind, which constituted their\r\nglory, and rendered their country illustrious.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps up a sort of rivalship between Greece and Egypt is that,\r\nindependently of the priority of knowledge, the former had the\r\neminent advantage of opening her arms to philosophy and the sciences,\r\nwhich, forsaking their adoptive country, and not being able to\r\nsurvive the loss of liberty, fled back to their natal soil, and\r\nfound, in the Museum of Alexandria, an asylum, which neither the\r\nLyceum, the Portico, nor the Academy, could longer afford them at\r\nAthens. Thus, to the reign of the Ptolemies are we, unquestionably,\r\nindebted for the preservation of the knowledge acquired by the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nApropos, I forgot to mention to you that BERTHOLET, a Senator and\r\nMember of the Institute, communicated to that society, in one of its\r\nsittings last month, a letter from FOURIER, the geometrician, and\r\nmember of the late Institute of Egypt. This _savant_, in the\r\nresearches he made in Upper Egypt, discovered and delineated several\r\nzodiacs, which, he says, fully confirm the theory of DUPUIS,\r\nrespecting the origin and antiquity of the figures of the zodiac. As\r\nfar back as the year 1781, DUPUIS published a memoir, since reprinted\r\nin his large work, entitled _De l'Origine des Cultes_, in which he\r\npresumes that the zodiac, such as it has been transmitted to us by\r\nthe Greeks, is of Egyptian origin, and that it goes back to fifteen\r\nthousand years, at least, before the era of the French revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 3, 1802._\r\n\r\nAn almost uninterrupted succession of wet weather has, of late,\r\nprecluded me from the regular enjoyment of a morning walk. But, with\r\nthe new year, we had a heavy fall of snow, which has since been\r\nsucceeded by a severe frost. I gladly availed myself of this\r\nopportunity of taking exercise, and yesterday, after viewing the\r\nskaiters in that part of the _Champs Elysées_ which had been\r\ninundated, and is now frozen, I immediately proceeded to the\r\n\r\nHÔTEL DES INVALIDES.\r\n\r\nThis majestic edifice was projected by Henry IV, and executed, by\r\norder of Lewis XIV, after the designs of BRUANT, who laid the\r\nfoundation on the 30th of November, 1671. It is composed of five\r\ncourts, surrounded by buildings. The middle court is as large as all\r\nthe other four.\r\n\r\nA spacious esplanade planted with trees, an outer court surrounded by\r\na wall newly-built, form the view towards the river, and lead to the\r\nprincipal façade, which is twelve hundred feet in extent. This façade\r\nhas, within these few years, been entirely polished anew: the details\r\nof sculpture have, perhaps, gained by the operation; but the\r\narchitecture has certainly lost that gloomy tint which gave to this\r\nbuilding a manly and respectable character. In the middle of this\r\nfaçade, in the arched part above the great gate, was a bas-relief of\r\nLewis XIV on horseback.\r\n\r\nThis gate leads to the great court, which is decorated by two rows of\r\narcades, the one above the other, forming, on the two stories,\r\nuniform galleries which give light to the apartments of the\r\ncircumference. The windows, which serve to light the upper apartments\r\nof the façade, are remarkable from their being placed in cuirasses,\r\nas those of the great court are in trophies of arms.\r\n\r\nFrom this court, you enter the church, now called the _Temple of\r\nMars_. It is ornamented with the Corinthian order, and has the form\r\nof a Greek cross. The pulpit no longer exists. The altar, which was\r\nmagnificently decorated, is likewise destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe chapels, to the number of six, were each ornamented by a cupola\r\npainted in fresco, and statues in marble by the greatest masters,\r\nwhich, after being left for some time exposed to the injuries of the\r\nair in the court looking towards the country, are at length deposited\r\nin the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\nTo the arches of this temple are suspended the standards and colours\r\ntaken from the enemy. Two British flags only contribute to augment\r\nthe number. The oldest of these trophies have been removed from\r\n_Notre-Dame_. When they were formerly displayed in that cathedral, a\r\ngeneral, who was constantly victorious, was called by the people the\r\n_upholsterer of Notre-Dame_; an energetic appellation which spoke\r\nhome to the feelings. But, however calculated these emblems of\r\nvictory may be to foster heroism in the mind of youth, and rekindle\r\nvalour in the heart of old age, what a subject of reflection do they\r\nnot afford to the philanthropist! How can he, in fact, contemplate\r\nthese different flags, without regretting the torrents of blood which\r\nthey have cost his fellow-creatures?\r\n\r\nIn this _Temple of Mars_ is erected the monument of TURENNE, whose\r\nbody, after various removals, was conveyed hither, in great pomp, on\r\nthe 1st of Vendémiaire, year IX (23d of September, 1800) conformably\r\nto a decree of the Consuls, and immediately deposited in the inside\r\nof this tomb.\r\n\r\nThe present government of France seems to have taken the hint from\r\nSt. Foix, who expresses his astonishment that Lewis XIV never\r\nconceived the idea of erecting, in the _Hôtel des Invalides_,\r\nmausolea, with the statues of the generals who had led with the\r\ngreatest glory the armies of the nation. \"Where could they be more\r\nhonourably interred,\" says he, \"than amidst those old soldiers, the\r\ncompanions of their fatigues, who, like themselves, had lavished\r\ntheir blood for their country?\"[1]\r\n\r\nAt the age of sixty-four, TURENNE was killed by a cannon-ball, while\r\nreconnoitring the enemy's batteries near the village of Salzbach in\r\nGermany, on the 27th of July, 1675. No less esteemed for his virtues\r\nas a man, than honoured for his talents as a general, he at last fell\r\na victim to his courage. His soldiers looked up to him as to a\r\nfather, and in his life-time always gave him that title. After his\r\ndeath, when they saw the embarrassment in which it left the generals\r\nwho succeeded him in the command of the army: \"_Let loose old\r\nPiebald_,\" said they, \"_he will guide us_.\"[2] The same ball which\r\n(to borrow a line from Pope) laid\r\n\r\n  \"The _god-like_ TURENNE prostrate in the dust,\"\r\n\r\nlikewise took off the arm of ST. HILAIRE, Lieutenant-general of\r\nartillery: his son, who was beside him at the moment, uttered a cry\r\nof grief. \"_'Tis not me, my son, that you must bewail_,\" said ST.\r\nHILAIRE; \"_'tis that great man._\"\r\n\r\nThe Marshal was as much lamented by the enemy as he was by his own\r\ncountrymen; and MONTECUCULLI, the general opposed to him, when he\r\nlearned the loss which France had sustained in the person of TURENNE,\r\nexclaimed: \"Then a man is dead who was an honour to human nature!\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans, for several years, left untilled the field where he was\r\nkilled; and the inhabitants shewed it as a sacred spot. They\r\nrespected the old tree under which, he reposed a little time before\r\nhis death, and would not suffer it to be cut down. The tree perished\r\nonly, because soldiers of all nations carried away pieces of it out\r\nof respect to his memory.\r\n\r\nTURENNE had been interred in the abbey of St. Denis, and at the time\r\nof the royal vaults being opened in 1793, by order of the National\r\nConvention, the remains of that great captain were respected amid the\r\ngeneral destruction which ensued. From the eagerness of the workmen\r\nto behold them, his tomb was the very first that was opened. When the\r\nlid of the coffin was removed, the Marshal was found in such a state\r\nof preservation that he was not at all disfigured: the features of\r\nhis face, far from being changed, were perfectly conformable to the\r\nportraits and medallions of TURENNE in our possession.\r\n\r\nThis monument, now placed in the _Temple of Mars_, had been erected\r\nto that warrior in the abbey of St. Denis, and was preserved through\r\nthe care of M. LENOIR; after being seen for five years in the MUSEUM\r\nOF FRENCH MONUMENTS, of which he is the director, it was removed\r\nhither by the before-mentioned decree of the Consuls. LE BRUN\r\nfurnished the designs from which it was executed. The group, composed\r\nof TURENNE in the arms of Immortality, is by TUBY; the accessory\r\nfigures, the one representing Wisdom, and the other, Valour, are by\r\nMARSY. The bas-relief in bronze in the middle of the cenotaph is\r\nlikewise by TURY, and represents TURENNE charging the enemy at the\r\nbattle of Turckheim, in 1675.\r\n\r\nThe dome forms a second church behind the large one, to which it\r\ncommunicates. Its exterior, entirely covered with lead, is surrounded\r\nby forty pillars of the Composite order, and ornamented with twelve\r\nlarge gilt coats of mail, crowned with helmets, which serve as\r\nskylights, and with a small lantern with pillars which support a\r\npyramid, surmounted by a large ball and a cross.\r\n\r\nAll the architecture of the dome, which is called the new church, is\r\nfrom the design of MANSARD. Its elevation, from the ground-floor, is\r\nthree hundred feet; and its diameter, fifty. It has the character of\r\nelegance. The beauty of its proportion, its decoration, and\r\nespecially all the parts which concur in forming the pyramid, render\r\nit a master-piece of architecture. But nothing commands admiration\r\nlike the interior, though it may be said to be three-fourths damaged.\r\nThe twelve windows, by which it is lighted, but which the observer\r\nbelow cannot perceive, are ornamented with coupled piasters, resting\r\non a continued pedestal. On the broad band, which was formerly\r\nadorned with flower-de-luces, and at this day with emblems of\r\nliberty, were the medallions of twelve of the most famous kings of\r\nFrance: namely, Clovis, Dagobert, Childebert, Charlemagne, Lewis the\r\nDebonair, Charles the Bald, Philip Augustus, St. Lewis, Lewis XII,\r\nHenry IV, Lewis XIII, and Lewis XIV. The first arch, distributed into\r\ntwelve equal parts, presented the twelve apostles, painted in fresco\r\nby JOUVENET. The second arch, painted by LA FOSSE, represented the\r\napotheosis of St. Lewis, offering to God his sword and crown. The\r\npavement, which alone has not suffered, is in compartments of\r\ndifferent marbles of great value.\r\n\r\nThe portal, which looks towards the country, is thirty toises in\r\nextent. Of all the figures which decorated this façade, those of the\r\nFour Virtues; namely, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence,\r\nare the only ones that have been suffered to remain in their places.\r\nThey are by COYZEVOX.\r\n\r\nThe other objects most worthy of notice in this spacious, building,\r\nwhich, together with its precincts, occupies seventeen _arpens_, are\r\nthe refectories and kitchens, which are very extensive. Formerly,\r\nneither of these were kept in such high order as they are at present.\r\nThe tables of the private soldiers are now better supplied; sirloins\r\nof beef and legs of mutton being no longer roasted for the officers\r\nonly. In the four refectories, where the soldiers dine, twelve in a\r\nmess, they are regularly served with soup, bouilli, a plate of\r\nvegetables, and a pint of unadulterated wine. When Peter the Great\r\nvisited this establishment, the Invalids happened to be at dinner,\r\nthe czar, on entering the first refectory, poured out a bumper of\r\nwine, and drank it off in a military style to the health of the\r\nveterans, whom he termed his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe halls are ornamented with paintings representing the conquests of\r\nLewis XIV. During the reign of terror the features of the _Grand\r\nMonarque_, who made a conspicuous figure in these pictures, were\r\nconcealed by a coat of dark paint, which answered the purpose of a\r\nmask. BONAPARTE has ordered this mask to be removed, so that the\r\nambitious monarch now reappears in all his former glory.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said in praise of establishments of this description,\r\nfor my part, I see nothing in them but the gratification of national\r\npride. The old soldiers, are, in a manner, without a comrade, though\r\nliving in the midst of their brother warriors. The good fellowship\r\nwhich they have witnessed in camps no longer subsists. The danger of\r\nbattles, the weight of fatigues, and the participation of privations\r\nand hardships, no longer form the tie of common interest, by which\r\nthey were once united. This, being dissolved, they seek in vain that\r\nreciprocity of little kindnesses which they used to find in their own\r\nregiments and armies. All hope of promotion or change being at an\r\nend, their only consolation is to enjoy the present by indulging in\r\nreveries concerning the past.\r\n\r\nInstead of being doomed to end their days in this sort of stately\r\nconfinement, subject to restrictions which render life so dull and\r\nmonotonous, how different would these veterans feel, could they\r\nretire to the bosom of their families and friends! Then, indeed,\r\nwould they dwell with delight on the battles and sieges in which they\r\nhad served, enumerating their many hair-breadth escapes, and\r\ndetailing the particulars of the fight in which they lost their\r\ndeficient leg or arm. After a pause, the sense of their country's\r\ngratitude operating powerfully on their mind, would soothe every\r\npainful recollection. Their auditors, impressed with admiration,\r\nwould listen in silence to the recital of the well-fought day, and,\r\nroused by the call of national honour, cheerfully step forth to\r\nemulate these mutilated heroes, provided they were sure of a _free_\r\nasylum, when reduced to their helpless condition.\r\n\r\nWhether I enter the _Hôtel des Invalides_, or _Chelsea Hospital_,\r\nsuch are the reflections which never fail to occur to me, when I\r\nvisit either of those establishments, and contemplate the dejected\r\ncountenances of the maimed beings that inhabit them.\r\n\r\nExperience tells us that men dislike enjoyments, regularly prepared\r\nfor them, if under restraint, and prefer smaller gratifications, of\r\nwhich they can partake without control. Policy, as well as prudence,\r\ntherefore dictates a departure from the present system of providing\r\nfor those maimed in fighting the battles of their nation.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I am fully persuaded that the sums expended in the\r\npurchase of the ground and construction of this magnificent edifice,\r\ntogether with the charges of maintaining the establishment, would\r\nhave formed a fund that might have enabled the government to allow\r\nevery wounded soldier a competent pension for life, in proportion to\r\nthe length of his services, and the injuries which he might have\r\nsuffered in defence of his country.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Hôtel des Invalides_ are avenues, planted with trees,\r\nwhich, on one side, communicate to the _New Boulevards_, and, on the\r\nother, to the\r\n\r\nCHAMP DE MARS.\r\n\r\nThis extensive inclosure was originally intended for the exercises of\r\nthe _École Militaire_, in front of which it is situated, as you will\r\nperceive by referring to the Plan of Paris. Its form is a\r\nparallelogram of four hundred and fifty toises in length by one\r\nhundred and fifty in breadth. It is surrounded by ditches, faced with\r\nmasonry, which are bordered on each side by a double row of trees,\r\nextending from the façade of the _ci-devant École Militaire_ to the\r\nbanks of the Seine. That building, I shall observe _en passant_, was\r\nfounded in 1751, by Lewis XV, for the military education of five\r\nhundred young gentlemen, destitute of fortune, whose fathers had died\r\nin the service. It stands on the south side of the _Champ de Mars_,\r\nand serves at present as barracks for the horse-grenadiers of the\r\nconsular guard. On the third story of one of the wings is a national\r\nobservatory, which was constructed at the instigation of Lalande, the\r\ncelebrated astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe various scenes of which the _Champ de Mars_ has successively been\r\nthe theatre, are too interesting to be passed over in silence.\r\nIndeed, they exhibit the character of the nation in such striking\r\ncolours, that to omit them, would be like omitting some of the\r\nprincipal features in the drawing of a portrait. Often have they been\r\nmentioned, it is true; but subsequent events have so weakened the\r\nremembrance of them, that they now present themselves to the mind\r\nmore like dreams than realities. However, I shall touch on the most\r\nremarkable only.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, a spacious arena, encompassed by a mound of earth, divided\r\ninto seats so as to accommodate three hundred thousand spectators,\r\nwas formed within this inclosure. To complete it speedily for the\r\nceremony of the first federation, required immense labour. The slow\r\nprogress of twenty-five thousand hired workmen could not keep pace\r\nwith the ardent wishes of the friends of liberty. But those were the\r\ndays of enthusiasm: concord and harmony then subsisted among the\r\ngreat majority of the French people. What other sentiments, in fact,\r\ncould daily bring together, in the _Champ de Mars_, two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand persons of every class, without distinction of age or\r\nsex, to work at the necessary excavation? Thus, at the end of a week,\r\nthe amphitheatre was completed as if by enchantment.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, since the time of the Spartans, was seen among any\r\npeople such an example of cordial union. It would be difficult for\r\nthe warmest imagination to conceive a picture so varied, so original,\r\nso animated. Every corporation, every society was ambitious of the\r\nhonour of assisting in the erection of the altar of the country: all\r\nwished to contribute, by individual labour, to the arrangement of the\r\nplace where they were to swear to defend the constitution. Not a man,\r\nwoman, or child remained an idle spectator. On this occasion, the\r\naged seemed to have recovered the vigour of youth, and women and\r\nchildren to have acquired the strength of manhood. In a word, men of\r\nall trades and professions were confounded, and cheerfully handled\r\nthe pickaxe and shovel: delicate females, sprucely dressed, were seen\r\nhere and there wheeling along barrows filled with earth; while long\r\nstrings of stout fellows dragged heavy loads in carts and waggons. As\r\nthe electric matter runs along the several links of an extensive\r\nchain, so patriotism seemed to have electrified this whole mass of\r\npeople. The shock was universal, and every heart vibrated in unison.\r\n\r\nThe general good order which prevailed among this vast assemblage,\r\ncomposed indiscriminately of persons of every rank and condition, was\r\ntruly surprising. No sort of improper discourse, no dispute of any\r\nkind occurred. But what is still more singular and more worthy of\r\nremark is, that the mutual confidence shewn by so many people,\r\nstrangers to each other, was in no one instance abused. Those who\r\nthrew off their coats and waistcoats, leaving them to the fate of\r\nchance, during the time they were at work elsewhere, on their return\r\nto the same spot found them untouched. Hence, as Paris is known to\r\nabound with _filoux_, it may be inferred that the _amor patriæ_ had\r\ndeadened in them the impulse of their ordinary vocation.\r\n\r\nFranklin, when promoting the emancipation of America, during his\r\nresidence in Paris, probably did not foresee that the French would\r\nsoon borrow his favourite expression, and that it would become the\r\nburden of a popular air. Yet so it happened; and even Lewis XVI\r\nhimself participated in the patriotic labours of the _Champ de Mars_,\r\nwhile different bands of military music made the whole inclosure\r\nresound with _ça ira_.\r\n\r\nTo these exhilarating scenes succeeded others of the most opposite\r\nnature. Hither the guillotine was transported for the execution of\r\nthe greatest astronomer of the age, and this with no other view than\r\nto prolong his punishment. Bailly, as every one knows, was the first\r\nmayor of Paris after the revolution. Launched into the vortex of\r\npolitics, he became involved in the proscriptions which ensued during\r\nthe reign of terror, and was dragged from prison to the _Champ de\r\nMars_, where, though exposed to the most trying insults, he died,\r\nlike a philosopher, with Socratic calmness.\r\n\r\nIn no one of the numerous victims of the revolution was the\r\ninstability of popular favour more fully exemplified than in Bailly.\r\nIn this _Champ de Mars_, where he had published martial law in\r\nconsequence of a decree of the Convention, in the very place where he\r\nhad been directed by the representatives of the people to repel the\r\nfactions, he expired under the guillotine, loaded with the execration\r\nof that same people of whom he had been the most venerated idol.\r\n\r\nSince those sanguinary times, the _Champ de Mars_ has chiefly been\r\nthe site chosen for the celebration of national fêtes, which, within\r\nthese few years, have assumed a character more distinguished than any\r\never seen under the old _régime_. These modern Olympics consist of\r\nchariot-races and wrestling, horse and foot races, ascensions of\r\nballoons, carrying three or four persons, descents from them by means\r\nof a parachute, mock-fights and aquatic tilting. After the sports of\r\nthe day, come splendid illuminations, grand fire-works, pantomimes\r\nrepresented by two or three hundred performers, and concerts, which,\r\naided by splendid decorations, are not deficient in point of effect:\r\nthe evening concludes with dancing.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of the directorial government, the number of\r\nnational fêtes had been considerably increased by the celebration of\r\nparty triumphs. They are at present reduced to the two great epochs\r\nof the revolution, the taking of the Bastille on the 14th of July,\r\n1789, and the foundation of the Republic on the 23d of September,\r\n1792. On the anniversary of those days, the variety of the\r\nexhibitions always attracted an immense concourse. The whole of this\r\nmound, whose greatest diameter is upwards of eight hundred yards, was\r\nthen covered with spectators; but were the _Champ de Mars_ now used\r\non such occasions, they would be compelled to stand, there being no\r\nlonger any seats for their accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of national fêtes has, in this country, employed many\r\npens, and excited much discussion. Some say that they might be\r\nrendered more interesting from the general arrangement; while others\r\naffirm that they might be made to harmonize more with the affections\r\nand habits of the people. In truth, this modern imitation of the\r\nGreek festivals has fallen far short of those animating,\r\nmirth-inspiring scenes, so ably described by the learned author of\r\nAnacharsis, where, to use his own words, \"every heart, eagerly bent\r\non pleasure, endeavoured to expand itself in a thousand different\r\nways, and communicated to others the impression which rendered it\r\nhappy.\" Whatever exertions have hitherto been made to augment the\r\nsplendour of these days of festivity, it seems not to admit of a\r\ndoubt that they are still susceptible of great improvement. If the\r\nFrench have not the wine of _Naxos_, their goblets may at least\r\nsparkle with _vin de Surenne_; the _Champs Elysées_ may supply the\r\nplace of the shady bowers of _Delos_; and, in lieu of the name of the\r\nill-fated NICIAS, the first promoter of the sports formerly\r\ncelebrated in that once-happy island, the air may be made to ring\r\nwith the name of the more fortunate BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Essais historiques sur Paris_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This was the name given by the soldiers to the Marshal's\r\nfavourite charger.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 6, 1802._\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the interior of the _Louvre_, in one of my former\r\nletters, I think I mentioned the various learned and scientific\r\nsocieties, which, under the name of Academies, formerly held their\r\nsittings in that palace. For the sake of facilitating a comparison\r\nbetween the past and the present, it may be necessary to state the\r\nprofessed object of those different institutions.\r\n\r\n_French Academy_. The preservation of the purity of the French\r\nlanguage, its embellishment and augmentation.\r\n\r\n_Academy of Sciences_. The progress of the sciences, the\r\nencouragement of researches and discoveries, as well in physics,\r\ngeometry, and astronomy, as in those sciences which are applicable to\r\nthe daily wants of society.\r\n\r\n_Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres_. The composition of\r\ninscriptions, of the subjects of medals, and their mottos, the\r\nresearch of the manners, habits, customs, and monuments of antiquity,\r\nas well as all literature relating to history.\r\n\r\n_Academy of Painting and Sculpture_.\r\n_Academy of Architecture_.\r\nThe titles of these are a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\nAll these academies were founded by Lewis XIV, at the instigation of\r\nhis minister Colbert; with the exception of the French Academy, which\r\nowed its origin to Cardinal Richelieu. This was a misfortune for that\r\nsociety; for custom had established it as a law that every new\r\nmember, on the day of his reception, should not only pronounce a\r\npanegyric on him whom he succeeded, but also on the founder of the\r\ninstitution. It certainly was not very philosophical for men of\r\nenlightened understanding, and possessing even a common portion of\r\nsensibility, to make an eulogium on a minister so cruel, a man of a\r\nspirit so diabolically vindictive, that he even punished the innocent\r\nto revenge himself on the guilty. De Thou, the celebrated author of\r\nthe _History of his own time_, had told some truths not very\r\nfavourable to the memory of the Cardinal's great uncle. In\r\nconsequence, the implacable minister, under false pretences, caused\r\nthe philosophic historian's eldest son to be condemned and\r\ndecapitated, saying: \"De Thou, the father, has put my name into his\r\nhistory, I will put the son into mine.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known, from their memoirs, that these academies included\r\namong their members men of eminent talents. The Academy of Sciences,\r\nin particular, could boast of several first-rate geniuses in the\r\ndifferent branches which they respectively cultivated, and the\r\nunremitting labours of some of them have, no doubt, greatly\r\ncontributed to enlarge the sphere of human knowledge. During the\r\nearly part of the revolution, all these monarchical institutions were\r\noverthrown, and on their ruins rose the\r\n\r\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.[1]\r\n\r\nThis establishment was formed, agreeably to a decree of the National\r\nAssembly passed on the 3d of Brumaire, year IV (25th of October,\r\n1796). By that decree, it appears that the Institute belongs to the\r\nwhole Republic, though its point of union is fixed in Paris. Its\r\nobject is to extend the limits of the arts and sciences in general,\r\nby an uninterrupted series of researches, by the publication of\r\ndiscoveries, by a correspondence with the learned societies of\r\nforeign countries, and by such scientific and literary labours as\r\ntend to general utility and the glory of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of one hundred and forty-four members, resident in\r\nParis, and of an equal number scattered over the departments. The\r\nnumber of its foreign associates is twenty-four. It is divided into\r\nthree classes, and each class into several sections, namely:\r\n\r\nMathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\nMoral and Political Sciences.\r\nLiterature and the Fine Arts.\r\nThe Mathematical Class is divided into ten sections; each of which\r\nconsists of six members. Of this class, there are sixty members in\r\nParis, and as many in the departments, where they are divided, in the\r\nsame manner, into ten sections, each of six members.\r\n\r\nThe first section comprehends Mathematics.\r\nThe second, Mechanical Arts.\r\nThe third, Astronomy.\r\nThe fourth, Experimental Physics.\r\nThe fifth, Chemistry.\r\nThe sixth, Natural History and Mineralogy.\r\nThe seventh, Botany and vegetable Physics.\r\nThe eighth, Anatomy and Zoology.\r\nThe ninth, Medicine and Surgery.\r\nThe tenth, Rural Economy and the Veterinary Art.\r\n\r\nThe Moral and Political Class is divided into six sections, each\r\nconsisting of six members, making in all thirty-six members in Paris,\r\nand an equal number in the departments.\r\n\r\nThe first section comprises the Analysis of Sensations and Ideas.\r\nThe second, Morals.\r\nThe third, Social Science and Legislation.\r\nThe fourth, Political Economy.\r\nThe fifth, History.\r\nThe sixth, Geography.\r\n\r\nThe Class of Literature and Fine Arts is divided into eight sections,\r\neach of six members, forty-eight of whom reside in Paris, and as many\r\nin the departments.\r\n\r\nThe first section includes Grammar.\r\nThe second, Ancient Languages.\r\nThe third, Poetry.\r\nThe fourth, Antiquities and Monuments.\r\nThe fifth, Painting.\r\nThe sixth, Sculpture.\r\nThe seventh, Architecture.\r\nThe eighth, Music and Declamation.\r\n\r\nTwice in every decade, each class holds a meeting: that of the first\r\nclass takes place on the first and sixth days; that of the second, on\r\nthe second and seventh days; and that of the third, on the third and\r\neighth days. Every six months each class elects its president and two\r\nsecretaries, who continue in office during that interval.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of the first decade of every month is held a general\r\nmeeting of the three classes, the purpose of which is to deliberate\r\non affairs, relating to the general interests of the Institute. The\r\nchair is then taken by the oldest of the three presidents, who, at\r\nthese meetings, presides over the whole society.\r\n\r\nThe National Institute has four public quarterly meetings, on the\r\n15th of the months of Vendémiaire, Nivôse, Germinal, and Messidor.\r\nEach class annually proposes two prize questions, and in the general\r\nmeetings, the answers are made public, and the premiums distributed.\r\nThe united sections of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture nominate\r\nthe pupils who are to visit Rome, and reside there in the national\r\npalace, at the expense of the Republic, in order to study the Fine\r\nArts. Conformably to the decree by which the Institute was organised,\r\nsix of its members were to travel at the public charge, with a view\r\nof collecting information, and acquiring experience in the different\r\nsciences; and twenty young men too were to visit foreign countries\r\nfor the purpose of studying rural economy: but the expenses of the\r\nwar and other matters have occasioned such a scarcity of money as,\r\nhitherto, to impede these undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of the Institute are on the first floor of the\r\n_Louvre_, or, as it is now styled, the _Palais Nationial des Sciences\r\net des Arts_. These apartments, which were once inhabited by Henry\r\nIV, are situated on the west side of that building. Before you arrive\r\nat the hall of the Institute, you pass through a handsome\r\nantichamber, in which are the statues of Molière, Racine, Corneille,\r\nLa Fontaine, and Montesquieu. This hall, which is oblong and\r\nspacious, formerly served for the meetings of the Academy of\r\nSciences. Its sides are adorned with colonnades, and the ceiling is\r\nrichly painted and decorated. In the intercolumniations are fourteen\r\nmarble statues (seven on each side) of some of the most celebrated\r\nmen that France has produced: namely, Condé, Tourville, Descartes,\r\nBayard, Sully, Turenne, Daguessau, Luxembourg, L'Hôpital, Bossuet,\r\nDuquesne, Catinat, Vauban, and Fenelon. Parallel to the walls, tables\r\nare set, covered with green cloth, at which the members take their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the hall is the chair of the President, and on\r\neach side below him are seated the two Secretaries. A little on one\r\nside again is the tribune, from which the members who speak address\r\nthe assembly, after having asked leave of the President, who never\r\nquits the chair during the whole meeting. The space appropriated to\r\nthe members is inclosed by a railing, between which and the walls,\r\nthe hall is surrounded by benches for the spectators, among whom\r\nthere are generally many of the fair sex.\r\n\r\nThe library of the Institute consists of three spacious apartments,\r\nwhich are said to contain about sixteen thousand volumes. On one side\r\nof the hall is an apartment, destined for the communications of\r\ncorrespondents. There is also an apartment for the secretary and his\r\ndeputies, and a large room containing a collection of machines and\r\nmodels, (among which are several of shipping), as well as every\r\napparatus necessary for chemical and physical experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have several times attended the private meetings of the\r\nthree classes, I have thought that the printed accounts of their\r\nproceedings, which I subjoin, would be more satisfactory than a hasty\r\nsketch from my pen. However, as I promised to describe to you one of\r\nthe public sittings of the Institute, I shall now inform you of what\r\npassed at that held yesterday, the 15th of Nivôse, year X, (5th of\r\nJanuary, 1802), at which I was present.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, BIGOT-PRÉAMENEU, one of the members of the class of\r\nMoral and Political Sciences, was the President. The sitting was\r\nopened by proclaiming the nomination of three foreign associates,\r\nelected by the Institute in its general sitting of the 5th of Nivôse;\r\nnamely, Mr. JEFFERSON, Sir JOSEPH BANKS, and HAYDN, the celebrated\r\nmusical composer. A prize was then awarded to Citizen Framery, a\r\nliterary character residing in Paris, for having solved the following\r\nquestion proposed by the class of Literature and Fine Arts. \"To\r\nanalyze the relations existing between music and declamation, and\r\ndetermine the means of applying declamation to music, without\r\ndetracting from the charms of melody.\"\r\n\r\nDELAMBRE read an account of the life and works of Cousin.\r\n\r\nDÉGÉRANDO, an account of the education which the young savage of\r\nAveyron receives from Itard, physician to the Institution of the Deaf\r\nand Dumb.\r\n\r\nPRONY, the result of observations made with a French instrument and\r\nan English one, for the purpose of determining the relation between\r\nthe French metre and the English foot.\r\n\r\nNext were heard notes, by CAMUS, on the public exhibitions of the\r\nproductions of French Industry, which took place in the years VI and\r\nIX of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThen, the report of the restoration of the famous picture known by\r\nthe name of the _Madonna di Foligno_, which I have already\r\ncommunicated to you.\r\n\r\nBUACHE, the celebrated geographer, read some observations on the\r\nancient map of the Romans, commonly called Peutinger's map, as well\r\nas on the geography of the anonymous writer of Ravenna. The sitting\r\nwas terminated by an account of the life and works of Dumoustier,\r\nread by COLIN D'HARLEVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Institute have a full-dress and a half-dress. The\r\nformer consists of a suit of black, embroidered in dark green silk,\r\nwith a cocked hat. The latter is the same, but the embroidery is\r\nconfined to the collar and cuffs of the coat, which is trimmed with a\r\ncord edging,\r\n\r\nP.S. Yesterday evening was married Mademoiselle Beauharnois,\r\ndaughter-in-law of the First Consul, to Louis Bonaparte, one of his\r\nyounger brothers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At the end of this volume will be found the new\r\norganization of the Institute, conformably to a decree of the\r\ngovernment, dated the 3d of Pluviôse, year XI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 7, 1802._\r\n\r\nKnowing you to be an amateur of Italian music, I am persuaded that\r\nyou will wish to be made acquainted with the theatre where you may\r\nenjoy it in full perfection. It is distinguished by the appellation\r\nof\r\n\r\nOPÉRA BUFFA.\r\n\r\nThis establishment is not new in the French metropolis. In 1788,\r\nParis was in possession of an excellent company of Italian comedians,\r\nwho then performed in the _Théâtre de Monsieur_, in the palace of the\r\n_Tuileries_, which is now converted into a hall for the sittings of\r\nthe Council of State. The success of this company had a rapid\r\ninfluence on the taste of the discerning part of the French public.\r\nThis was the less extraordinary as, perhaps, no Italian sovereign had\r\never assembled one composed of so many capital performers. In Italy,\r\nthere are seldom more than two of that degree of merit in a company;\r\nthe rest are not attended to, because they are not worth the trouble:\r\nbut here every department was complete, and filled by persons\r\ndeservedly enjoying a high reputation in their own country; such as\r\nMANDINI, RAFFANELLI, SIMONI, MENGOZZI, VIGANONI, ROVEDINO, and\r\nSignoras MORICHELLI and BALETTI.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1792 banished from Paris this admired assemblage. A new\r\ncompany of Italian comedians has been formed here within these few\r\nmonths: they at first occupied a charming little theatre constructed\r\nfor the use of a society, called _La Loge Olympique_; but are lately\r\nremoved to the _Théâtre Favart_, on the Boulevard. Before the\r\nrevolution, this was called _le Théâtre Italien_. The façade is\r\ndecorated with eight very large Ionic pillars. The house is of an\r\noval form, and the interior distribution deserving of praise, in as\r\nmuch as it is far more commodious than that of any other theatre in\r\nParis. The audience here too is generally of a more select\r\ndescription. Among the female amateurs, Madame Tallien is one of its\r\nmost constant visiters, and, in point of grace and beauty, one of its\r\ngreatest ornaments.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this new company, may be placed RAFFANELLI, the same\r\nwhom I have just mentioned. He is a consummate comedian, and more to\r\nbe commended in that point of view than as a singer. RAFFANELLI has a\r\ncountenance to which he gives any cast he pleases: his features, from\r\ntheir wonderful pliability, receive every impression: his eye is\r\nquick; his delivery, natural and correct; and his action, easy.\r\nSometimes he carries his buffooneries too far, merely to excite\r\nlaughter; but as he never fails in his object, this defect may be\r\noverlooked. His best characters are _Taddeo_ in _Il Rè Theodora_, _il\r\nGovernatore_ in _La Molinara_, the Father in _Furberia e Puntiglio_,\r\nand the Deaf Man in _Il Matrimonio Secreto_. It is necessary to see\r\nhim in these different operas to form a just idea of the truth and\r\nhumour with which he represents them. Although he is but an\r\nindifferent singer, his method is good, and he seizes the spirit of\r\nthe composer with perfect discrimination. In _morceaux d'ensemble_,\r\nhe is quite at home, and when he dialogues with the orchestra, he\r\nshews much energy and feeling. Independently of these gifts, Nature\r\nhas granted to RAFFANELLI another most valuable privilege. She seems\r\nto have exempted him from the impression of time. In 1788 and 89, I\r\nsaw him frequently, both on and off the stage; after a lapse of\r\nupwards of twelve years, he appears again to my eyes exactly the same\r\nman. I cannot perceive in him the smallest change.\r\n\r\nThe tenor of the new company is LAZZARINI. His method too is very\r\ngood; he sings with taste, expression, and feeling; but his voice is\r\nextremely weak: his powers appear exhausted; and it is only by dint\r\nof painful efforts that he succeeds in giving to his singing those\r\nembellishments which his taste suggests, but which lose their grace\r\nand charm when they are laboured. In short, LAZZARINI communicates to\r\nthe audience an unpleasant sensation in proving that he has real\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nNeither the same reproaches nor the same praises can be bestowed on\r\nPARLAMAGNI. He is a good counter-tenor, but has a harshness in the\r\nhigh tones, which he does not always reach with perfect justness. He\r\nis also deficient in ease and grace. PARLAMAGNI, however, having an\r\nadvantageous person, and the air of a Frenchman, is a great favourite\r\nwith the Parisian _dilettanti_. He is a tolerably good comedian, and\r\nin some scenes of buffoonery, his acting is natural, and his manner\r\nfree and unaffected.\r\n\r\nThe _prima donna_ of the Italian company is Signora STRINA-SACCHI.\r\nShe possesses a fine voice, and no small share of taste, joined to\r\ngreat confidence and a perfect acquaintance with the stage. Sometimes\r\nshe is rather apt to fatigue the ear by sounds too shrill, and thus\r\nbreaks the charm produced by her singing. As for her acting, it is as\r\nextraordinary as can well be imagined; for her vivacity knows no\r\nbounds; and her passion, no restraint. She appears to conceive\r\njustly, to feel very warmly, and she plays in the same manner. In\r\nher, Nature commands every thing; Art, nothing. The parts in which\r\nshe shines most, are _La Molinara_ and _Gianina_; in these, she\r\nliterally follows the impulse given her by her situation, without\r\nconcerning herself in the least, whether it is _secundum artem_; but\r\ncertain that it is natural and conformable to the character and\r\nhabits of the personage she represents. _Anima in voce_ is the\r\ncharacteristic of her singing: the same epithet may be applied to her\r\nrecitative and her acting: in these she displays no less spirit and\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\nAfter Signora SACCHI, comes Signora PARLAMAGNI. She is a young, and\r\nrather pretty woman, not unlike a French actress in her manner. Her\r\nvoice is free and clear, and her method by no means to be disdained.\r\nShe wants habit and confidence. This is evident in her performance of\r\na part new to her; for it is only after a few representations that\r\nshe feels herself at her ease. Then the public appreciate her powers,\r\nwhich she exhibits to advantage; and her exertions are rewarded by\r\nreiterated marks of their satisfaction.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is the nature of an Italian opera-house to have its\r\nshelf poorly furnished. It cannot, however, be denied that the\r\nmanagers of the _Opera Buffa_ take every pains to vary and increase\r\ntheir stock. The following are the pieces which I have seen at this\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\n_Furberia e Puntiglio_, which is a second-hand imitation of GOLDONI.\r\nThe music, by Signor MARCELLO DI CAPUA, is agreeable, particularly a\r\nquartetto and a cavatina. RAFFANELLI shines in this piece as a\r\nfirst-rate actor.\r\n\r\n_Il Matrimonio Secreto_, the chef-d'oeuvre of CIMAROSA, and of its\r\nkind, perhaps, the most charming opera extant. Throughout it, the\r\ncomposer has lavished beauties; there is not to be found in it an air\r\nof inferior merit, or which, of itself alone, would not sustain the\r\nreputation of a piece. What then can be said of a work in which they\r\nare all united? Nothing can surpass the variety, spirit, grace, and\r\noriginality of the duos, terzettos, quartettos, &c. with which this\r\nopera abounds. CIMAROSA has here combined the strength of German\r\nharmony with the grace which constitutes the charm of Italian melody.\r\nHe is particularly famous for the brilliancy of his ideas, the\r\nfecundity of his genius, the richness of his style, and, above all,\r\nfor the finish of his pictures.\r\n\r\nThe certain effect of such a production is to eclipse every thing put\r\nin competition with it. This effect is particularly conspicuous at\r\nthe representation of other pieces, the music of which is by the same\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\n_Gianina e Bernadone_, another of CIMAROSA'S productions, makes less\r\nimpression, though it is in the graceful style, what _Il Matrimonio\r\nSecreto_ is in the serio-comic.\r\n\r\n_La Molinara_, however, upholds the reputation of that celebrated\r\ncomposer, PAËSIELLO. This opera requires no eulogium. Selections from\r\nit are daily repeated in the public and private concerts in Paris.\r\n_Il Matrimonio Secreto_ is a masterpiece of spirit and originality,\r\nwhile _La Molinara_ is a model of grace, melody, and simplicity.\r\n\r\nTo the great regret of the lovers of Italian music, CIMAROSA died not\r\nlong since, just as he was preparing to visit Paris. But his fame\r\nwill long survive, as his works bear the stamp of true genius,\r\ncombined with taste and judgment. His _Italiana in Londra_ is just\r\nannounced for representation.\r\n\r\n_Il Matrimonio Inaspettato_, a composition of PAËSIELLO, is likewise\r\nin rehearsal, as well as _Le Nozze di Dorina_, by SARTI, and _La\r\nVilanella Rapita_, by BIANCHI. MOZART too will soon enter the lists;\r\nhis _Dom Giovanni_ is to be speedily brought forward.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra of the _Opéra Buffa_, though far from numerous, is\r\nextremely well-composed. It accompanies the singers with an\r\n_ensemble_, a grace, and precision deserving of the highest encomium.\r\nBRUNI, a distinguished Italian composer, is the leader of the band,\r\nand PARENTI, a professor, known also by several admired productions,\r\npresides at the piano-forte.\r\n\r\nNEUVILLE, the manager of this theatre, is gone to Italy for the\r\npurpose of completing the company by the addition of some eminent\r\nperformers.[1] In its present state, the _Opéra Buffa_ maintains its\r\nground. It is thought that the French government will assist it in\r\ncase of necessity, and even make it a national establishment; a\r\ncommissary or agent having been appointed to superintend its\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Opéra Buffa_, the constant object of the jealousy\r\nof the other lyric theatres, because it constitutes the delight of\r\nreal amateurs of music, has, during the year 1802, acquired several\r\nnew performers. Two of these only, Madame BOLLA and MARTINELLI,\r\ndeserve particular mention. Madame BOLLA is a good figure on the\r\nstage, and though her features are not regular, yet they are\r\nsusceptible of the most varied expression. Her voice, which is a\r\nspecies of feminine _tenore_, astonishes by the purity and firmness\r\nof its grave tones; while her brilliant and sure method easily\r\nconceals its small extent in the higher notes. MARTINELLI is a\r\nspecies of counter-tenor. His voice has already lost much of its\r\nstrength, and has not that clearness which serves as an excuse for\r\nevery thing; but connoisseurs find that he takes care to calculate\r\nits effects so as to make amends, by the art of transitions, for that\r\nfirmness in which it is deficient. He is much applauded in the\r\n_cantabile_, which he sings with uncommon precision, and he\r\nparticularly shines in the counter-parts which charm in the Italian\r\n_finales_. As an actor, MARTINELLI, though inferior to RAFFANELLI, is\r\nalso remarkable. His manner is easy and natural, and his countenance\r\ncapable of assuming the most comic expression.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 9, 1802._\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated accounts of the interior state of France which have\r\nreached us, through various channels, during the late obstinate\r\nstruggle, have diffused so many contradictions, that it is by no\r\nmeans surprising we still continue so ill-informed in England on many\r\npoints most intimately connected with the morals of the French\r\nnation. Respecting none of these, have we been more essentially\r\nmistaken than the\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF PUBLIC WORSHIP.\r\n\r\nI am given to understand, from unquestionable authority, that there\r\nare at this moment, and have been for the last four years, no less\r\nthan from thirty-five to forty thousand churches where divine service\r\nhas been regularly performed throughout the different departments of\r\nthe Republic. It is therefore a gross error to suppose that the\r\nchristian religion was extinguished in France. The recent\r\narrangements made between the French government and the See of Rome\r\nwill consolidate that religion, which was, in a great measure,\r\nre-established long before his Holiness occupied the papal chair. I\r\nshall illustrate this truth by a summary of the proceedings of the\r\nconstitutional clergy.\r\n\r\nThe last general assembly of the clergy of France, held in 1789, the\r\naccount of which has never been printed, already presented facts\r\nwhich announced that the necessity of reforming abuses was felt, and\r\nthe epoch when that reform would take place was foreseen. In this\r\nassembly several bishops spoke with much force on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous state of the finances, brought about by the shameful\r\ndilapidations of the court, occasioned a deficit which it was\r\nnecessary to make good. This consideration, joined to the spirit of\r\ncupidity, jealous of the estates of the clergy, immediately caused\r\nevery eye to turn towards that mortmain property, in order to employ\r\nit in the liquidation of the national debt.\r\n\r\nIn the _Moniteur_, and other journals of the time, may be seen what\r\nsuccessive steps gradually led to the abolition of tythes, and the\r\ndecision which placed the estates of the clergy at the disposal of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe civil constitution of the clergy was a severe check given to the\r\nmany existing abuses. It really brought back the Gallican church to\r\nthe discipline of the first ages. It snatched from the Pope the power\r\nof giving the canonical institution to bishops. Those who have\r\nthought proper to tax with novelty this constitution, have only to\r\nlook into history. They will see that, during twelve hundred years,\r\nbishops received the canonical institution from the metropolitans,\r\nand not from the Pope. Thus to tax with intrusion the constitutional\r\nbishops, and condemn them because they have received that institution\r\nfrom the metropolitans, is to condemn the first twelve centuries of\r\nchristianity.\r\n\r\nThis civil constitution served as a pretext to the dignified clergy,\r\nirritated at the loss of their estates, for concerting a combined\r\nresistance to the new laws, in the hope that this resistance would\r\nlead to a subversion which would restore to them their riches. Thence\r\nthe refusal of the oath \"to be faithful to the nation, to the law,\r\nand to the king, to guide faithfully the flock intrusted to their\r\ncare, and to maintain with all their power the constitution decreed\r\nby the assembly, and sanctioned by the king.\" Thence the line of\r\ndivision between the clergy who had taken the oath and those who had\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly, who had decreed the above oath, declared,\r\nthat the refusal of giving this pledge of fidelity should be\r\nconsidered as a voluntary resignation. The royal sanction had\r\nrendered the above decree a law of the State. Almost the whole of the\r\nbishops, a great number of rectors, and other ecclesiastics, refused\r\nto take this oath, already taken by several among them who were\r\ndeputies to the assembly.\r\n\r\nThey were, in consequence, declared to have resigned; and measures\r\nwere taken for supplying their place. The people proceeded to effect\r\nthis by electors authorized by law. A respectable number of\r\necclesiastics, who had already submitted to the law, accepted the\r\nelections. These priests thought that obedience to the national\r\nauthority which respected and protected religion, was a catholic\r\ndogma. What resistance could be made to legitimate power, which\r\nneither attacked the dogma, nor morality, nor the interior and\r\nessential discipline of the church? It was, say they, resisting God\r\nhimself. They thought that the pastor was chosen, and sent solely for\r\nthe care of the flock intrusted to him; that, when difficult\r\ncircumstances, flight, for instance, voluntary or forced, the\r\nprohibition from all functions, pronounced by the civil power,\r\nrendered the holy ministry impossible, or that the pastor could not\r\nexericise it, without declaring himself in open insurrection, the\r\npretended unremoveable rights then ceased with the sacred duties\r\nwhich they could not discharge, without being accused of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe dissentient bishops drew many priests into their party. Most of\r\nthem spread themselves over Europe, where they calumniated at their\r\nease the patriotic clergy. Those of their adherents who had remained\r\nin the interior of this country, kindled a civil war, tormented\r\npeople's consciences, and disturbed the peace of families, &c. This\r\nconduct, which engendered the horrible scenes in La Vendée, provoked\r\nrepressive measures, emanated from legislative authority.\r\n\r\nEnemies without and within, say the constitutional clergy, wished to\r\ncreate a disgust to liberty, by substituting to it licentiousness.\r\nAnd, indeed, the partisans of the dissentient clergy were seen to\r\ncoalesce with the unbelievers, in order to produce the sacrilegious\r\ndisorders which broke out every where in the year 1793.\r\n\r\nThe clergy who had taken the oath had organized the dioceses; the\r\nbishops, in general, had bestowed great pains in spreading in every\r\nparish the word of the gospel; for they preached themselves, and this\r\nwas more than was done by their predecessors, who, engaged only in\r\nspending, frequently in a shameful manner, immense revenues, seldom\r\nor never visited their dioceses. The constitutional clergy followed a\r\nplan more conformable to the gospel, which gained them the affection\r\nof the well-disposed part of the nation.\r\n\r\nThese priests were of opinion that the storm which threatened\r\nreligion, required imperiously the immediate presence of the pastor,\r\nand that, in the day of battle, it was necessary to be in person at\r\nthe breach. They were of opinion that the omission or impossibility\r\nof fulfilling minute and empty formalities, imposed by a Concordat,\r\nrejected from the beginning by all the public bodies and the church\r\nof France, and annihilated at the moment by the will of the\r\nrepresentatives of the nation, sanctioned by royal authority, could\r\nnot exempt them from accepting holy functions presented by all the\r\nconstituted authorities, and on which evidently depended the\r\npreservation of religion, the salvation of the faithful, and the\r\npeace of the State.\r\n\r\nBut, when persecution manifested itself, the clergy who had taken the\r\noath, became equally the victims of persecuting rage. Some failed in\r\nthis conjuncture; but the greater number remained intrepid in their\r\nprinciples. Accordingly several constitutional bishops and priests\r\nwere dragged to the scaffold. If, on the one hand, the dastardly\r\nGOBEL was guillotined, the same fate attended the respectable\r\nEXPILLY, bishop of Quimper, AMOURETTE, bishop of Lyons, and GOUTTES,\r\nbishop of Autun, &c.\r\n\r\nThe dissentient clergy reproach some constitutional priests with\r\nhaving married, and even with having apostatized; but they say not\r\nthat, among the dissentient, there are some who; have done the same.\r\nIf the number of the latter is smaller, it is because the greater\r\npart of them were out of France; but what would they have done, if,\r\nlike the constitutional clergy, they had either had the axe suspended\r\nover their head, or the guillotine accompanying all their steps?\r\n\r\nIn England, where the French priests were not thus exposed, there are\r\nsome who have likewise married, and even some who have apostatized.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that, amidst the terrors of impiety, GRÉGOIRE,\r\nbishop of Blois, declared that he braved them, and remained attached\r\nto his principles and duties, as a christian and bishop. He firmly\r\nbelieved that, in doing so, he was pronouncing his sentence of death,\r\nand, for eighteen months, he was in expectation of ascending the\r\nscaffold. The same courage animated the majority of the\r\nconstitutional bishops and priests. They exercised secretly their\r\nministry, and consoled the faithful. As soon as the rage for\r\npersecution began to abate, GRÉGOIRE and some other bishops, who had\r\nkept up a private correspondence with the clergy of various dioceses\r\nfor the purpose of encouraging them, concerted together in order to\r\nreorganize worship. In Nivôse year III (January 1795), GRÉGOIRE\r\ndemanded this liberty of worship of the National Convention. He was\r\nvery sure of meeting with outrages, and he experienced some; but to\r\nspeak in the tribune, was speaking to France and to all Europe, and,\r\nin the then state of things, he was almost certain of staggering\r\npublic opinion, which would force the Convention to grant the free\r\nexercise of religion. Accordingly, some time after having refused the\r\nliberty of worship on the demand of GRÉGOIRE, that assembly granted\r\nit, though with evident reluctance, on a Report of BOISSY D'ANGLAS,\r\nwhich insulted every species of worship.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional bishops had already anticipated this moment by\r\ntheir writings and their pastoral letters, &c. They then compiled two\r\nworks, entitled _Lettres Encycliques_, to which the bishops and\r\npriests of the various dioceses adhered. The object of these works,\r\nwhich are monuments of wisdom, piety, and courage, was to reorganize\r\npublic worship in all the dioceses, according to the principles of\r\nthe primitive church. They pronounced a formal exclusion from\r\necclesiastical functions against all prevaricating priests or married\r\nones, as well as all those who had the cowardice to deliver up their\r\nauthority for preaching, and abdicate their functions. Some\r\ninterested persons thought this too severe. Those bishops persisted\r\nin their decision, and, by way of answer, they reprinted a\r\ntranslation of the celebrated treatise of St. Cyprian de Lapsis. On\r\nall sides, they reanimated religions zeal, caused pastors for the\r\nvarious sees to be elected by the people, and consecrated by the\r\nmetropolitan bishops. They held synods, the arts of which form a\r\nvaluable collection, equally honourable to their zeal and knowledge.\r\nThey did more.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past the custom of holding councils had fallen into\r\ndisuse. They convoked a national council, notwithstanding the\r\nunfavourableness of a silent persecution; and, in spite of the penury\r\nwhich afflicted the pastors, the latter had the courage to expose\r\nthemselves in order to concur in it. This council was opened with the\r\ngreatest solemnity on the 15th of August, 1797, the day of the\r\nAssumption of the Virgin. It sat for three months. The canons and\r\ndecrees of this assembly, which have been translated into Italian and\r\nGerman, have been printed in one volume.\r\n\r\nThis council was published in the different dioceses, and its\r\nregulations were put into force. During this time, the government,\r\never hostile to religion, had not abandoned the project of\r\npersecuting and perhaps of destroying it. The voice of the public,\r\nwho called for this religion, and held in esteem the constitutional\r\nclergy as religious and patriotic, checked, in some respects, the\r\nhatred of the Directory and its agents. Then the spirit of\r\npersecution took a circuitous way to gain its end: this was to cry\r\ndown religion and its ministers, to promote theophilanthropy, and\r\nenforce the transferring of Sunday to the _décade_, or tenth day of\r\nevery republican month.\r\n\r\nThe bishops, assembled at Paris, again caused this project to\r\nmiscarry, and, in their name, GRÉGOIRE compiled two consultations\r\nagainst the transferring of Sunday to the _décade_. The adhesion of\r\nall the clergy was the fruit of his labour; but all this drew on him\r\nnumerous outrages, the indigence to which he was at that time\r\nreduced, and multiplied threats of deportation. The functions which\r\nhe had discharged, and the esteem of the friends of religion, formed\r\naround him a shelter of opinion that saved him from deportation, to\r\nwhich were condemned so many unfortunate and virtuous constitutional\r\npriests, who were crowded, with the refractory among others, into\r\nvessels lying in the road of Rochefort.\r\n\r\nGRÉGOIRE remonstrated against this grievance, and obtained an\r\nalleviation for his brethren; but it is to be remarked that, in\r\ngiving an account of their enlargement, the dissentient priests have\r\ntaken good care not to mention to whom they were indebted for having\r\nprovoked in their behalf this act of humanity and justice.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional clergy continued their labours, struggling\r\nincessantly against calumny and libels, either from their dissentient\r\nbrethren or from the agents of the directorial government. This\r\nclergy convoked a second national council for the year 1801. It was\r\npreceded by a vast number of synods, and by eight metropolitan\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nThis second national council was opened at Paris on St. Peter's day\r\nof the same year. Several decrees had already been carried, one of\r\nwhich renewed, in the face of the whole church, the example of the\r\nbishops of Africa, by a solemn invitation of the dissentients to\r\nconferences for the grand affair which separated them from the\r\nconstitutional clergy. The different congregations were on the point\r\nof presenting to the general meeting their labours on the dogma,\r\nmorality, and discipline. A report on the liturgy by GRÉGOIRE, bishop\r\nof Blois and vice-president of the council; and a similar report on\r\nthe plan of education for ecclesiastics, occupied the members of this\r\nassembly, when all at once the government manifested its wish to see\r\nthe council closed, on account of the Concordat which it had just\r\narranged with the Pope.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this proceeding, which trenched on the rights of a\r\nnational church, the fathers of the council suspended their\r\nremonstrances, in order not to afford any pretext to those who might\r\nhave wished to perpetuate religious troubles. Wherefore, after having\r\nsat six weeks and pronounced the suspension of the national council,\r\n&c. they separated quietly without quitting Paris.\r\n\r\nTheir presence was necessary for the execution of the decree of the\r\nconferences. The eighteen members destined for that purpose by the\r\ncouncil, after having held several meetings, presented themselves at\r\nthe Cathedral of _Notre-Dame_, the place appointed and proclaimed by\r\nthe council throughout all the extent of France. For three successive\r\ndays, morning and evening, they there assembled. At the expiration of\r\nthat time, on seeing that the dissentient kept themselves concealed,\r\nthe members of the constitutional clergy took for witnesses of this\r\ngenerous and open proceeding the vast body of people who had repaired\r\nto _Notre-Dame_, and by two energetic and moving discourses,\r\ndelivered by BELMAY, bishop of Carcassonne, and GRÉGOIRE, bishop of\r\nBlois, terminated the council after the accustomed prayers.\r\n\r\nM. SPINA, archbishop of Corinth, charged by the court of Rome with\r\npart of the affairs to be transacted with the First Consul, about the\r\nmiddle of September, sent to the constitutional bishops a brief which\r\nhe announced to come from Pius VII, in order to induce them on the\r\npart of the Pope to give up the episcopal sees they had occupied, and\r\nreturn to unity. An invitation so insulting, received by all these\r\nbishops, drew on M. SPINA energetic answers, which made the Pope and\r\nhimself sensible how wrong they were to accuse of intrusion and\r\nschism bishops, whose canonical institution was conformable to that\r\nof the bishops of the first twelve centuries, and who had always\r\nprofessed the warmest love for catholic unity.\r\n\r\nBut as there was little good to be expected from M. SPINA, some\r\nbishops made their complaints to the government in a spirited and\r\nwell-composed memorial, denouncing the Pope's brief as an attack on\r\nthe liberties of the Gallican church and the rights of the Republic.\r\nThis measure had its effect. The government passed a decree for\r\nprohibiting the publication of the Rescripts of Rome, if they should\r\nnot be found conformable to the rules and usages observed in France.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, the Cardinal Legate, CAPRARA, arrived in\r\nParis. The Concordat had just been signed. The constitutional\r\nbishops, without remonstrating against it, no sooner learnt that the\r\ngovernment wished them to resign, than they hastened to do so, the\r\nmore willingly, as they had a thousand times made the promise\r\nwhenever the good of religion and of the country should require it. A\r\nsimilar generosity was expected on the part of the emigrated bishops.\r\nHave they been to blame in refusing? This question may, in a great\r\nmeasure, depend on the arrangement of the Concordat, and the\r\nimperious and menacing tone of the court of Rome which demanded of\r\nthem the resignation of their former sees.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the gratification of the reader is here annexed an\r\naccount of the Pope's conduct in regard to the constitutional clergy,\r\nsince the promulgation of the Concordat.\r\n\r\nAt length the nominations took place. A small number of those\r\nappointed to the sixty new dioceses, were taken from the\r\nconstitutional clergy. The others were taken from the mass of the\r\nrefractory and those who had retracted, and the greater number formed\r\nthe most eloquent apology of the constitutional bishops. They all\r\nreceived the institution from the Pope, who announced it with an air\r\nof triumph to the college of Cardinals, in his collocution of the\r\n24th of May, 1802. He had good reason to congratulate himself at this\r\nepoch, the more so as he had been made to believe that the re-elected\r\nconstitutional clergy had made a retraction, and received penitence\r\nand absolution. The author of this calumny was BERNIER, who had been\r\ncharged by the Cardinal Legate with a step so worthy of his former\r\nmilitary exploits. It was solemnly contradicted. After the decree of\r\nabsolution which BERNIER had ventured to present to these bishops was\r\nthrown with indignation into the fire of PORTALIS, the counsellor of\r\nstate charged by the government with religious affairs, who was\r\nwitness to the transaction. Indeed, he had in this encouraged the\r\nbishops to imitate his own example in getting rid, by the same means,\r\nof a brief which the Legate had transmitted to him in order to\r\nabsolve him from the guilt he might have incurred by taking part in\r\nthe revolution.\r\n\r\nThe government wished to pacify religious troubles; but the majority\r\nof the dissentient bishops began to foment new disputes, by requiring\r\nretractations from the constitutional clergy, who, for the most part,\r\nhave stood firm amidst privations of every description. However, the\r\nmischief made not the progress which there was every reason to\r\napprehend: the government pronounced its opinion thereon by\r\nprohibiting bishops from requiring any thing more than submission to\r\nthe Concordat, and obedience to the new bishops. Notwithstanding the\r\nwise intentions of the government, sincerely desirous of peace and\r\nconcord, it is only in the dioceses fallen to the constitutional\r\nbishops that a good understanding prevails. Most of the disentient\r\nclergy continue to promote discord, and torment their constitutional\r\nbrethren. BOISCHOLLET, bishop of Séez, MONTAULT, bishop of Angers,\r\nand some others, have been sent for to Paris, in order to be\r\nreprimanded and cautioned to behave better.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to mention the documents which Cardinal CAPRARA has\r\ndistributed to all the bishops. They form a collection of thirteen\r\npapers, which might not improperly be called an analysis of the\r\ndecretals of Isidorus. On these, no doubt, good canonists will debate\r\nat some future day, in order to shame the court of Rome, by pointing\r\nout its absurdities and blunders; and certainly the respect which\r\ncatholics owe to the Holy See ought not to prevent then from\r\nresisting the pretensions of the Pope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 10, 1802._\r\n\r\nGoing the other day to call on M. S----i, I stopped by the way, to\r\nexamine an edifice which, when I first visited Paris in 1784, engaged\r\nno small share of public attention. It was, at that time, one of the\r\nprincipal objects pointed out to the curiosity of strangers. At one\r\nperiod of the revolution, you will, doubtless, recollect the frequent\r\nmention made of the\r\n\r\nPANTHEON.\r\n\r\nConceive my surprise, on learning that this stately building, after\r\nhaving employed the hands of so many men, for the best part of half a\r\ncentury, was not only still unfinished; but had threatened\r\napproaching ruin. Yes--like the Gothic abbey at Fonthill, it would,\r\nby all accounts, have fallen to the ground, without the aid of\r\nvandalism, had not prompt and efficacious measures been adopted, to\r\navert the impending mischief.\r\n\r\nThis monument, originally intended for the reception of the shrine of\r\nSt. Geneviève, once the patroness of the Parisians, is situated on an\r\neminence, formerly called _Mont St. Étienne_, to the left of the top\r\nof the _Rue St. Jacques_, near the _Place de l'Estrapade_. It was\r\nbegun under the reign of Lewis XV, who laid the first stone on the\r\n6th of September, 1764. During the American war, the works were\r\nsuspended; but, early in the year 1784, they were resumed with\r\nincreasing activity. The sculpture of this church already presented\r\nmany attributes analogous to its object, when, in 1793, it was\r\nconverted into a Pantheon.\r\n\r\nThe late M. SOUFFLOT furnished the plan for the church, which, in\r\npoint of magnificence, does honour both to the architect and to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIts form is a Greek cross, three hundred and forty feet in length by\r\ntwo hundred and fifty in breadth. The porch, which is an imitation of\r\nthat of the Pantheon at Rome, consists of a peristyle of twenty-two\r\npillars of the Corinthian order. Eighteen of these are insulated, and\r\nare each five feet and a half in diameter by fifty-eight in height,\r\nincluding their base and capital. They support a pediment, which\r\ncombines the boldness of the Gothic with the beauty of the Greek\r\nstyle. This pediment bears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n  \"AUX GRANDS HOMMES,\r\n  LA PATRIE RECONNAISSANTE.\"\r\n\r\nIn the delirium of the revolutionary fever, when great crimes\r\nconstituted great men, this sanctuary of national gratitude was\r\npolluted. MARAT, that man of blood, was, to use the modern\r\nphraseology, _pantheonized_, that is, interred in the Pantheon. When\r\nthe delirium had, in some measure, subsided, and reason began to\r\nresume her empire, he was _dispantheonized_; and, by means of\r\nquick-lime, his canonized bones were confounded with the dust.\r\nThis apotheosis will ever be a blot in the page of the history of\r\nthe revolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, it operated as a check on the inconsiderate zeal of\r\nhot-brained patriots in bestowing the honours of the Pantheon on\r\nthe undeserving. MIRABEAU was, consequently, _dispantheonized_; and,\r\nin all probability, this temple will, in future, be reserved for the\r\nashes of men truly great; legislators whose eminent talents and\r\nvirtues have benefited their fellow-citizens, or warriors, who, by\r\ndistinguishing themselves in their country's cause, have really\r\nmerited that country's gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this temple consists of four naves, in whose centre\r\nrises an elegant dome, which, it is said, is to be painted in fresco\r\nby DAVID. The naves are decorated by one hundred and thirty fluted\r\npillars, also of the Corinthian order, supporting an entablature,\r\nwhich serves as a base for lofty _tribunes_, bordered by stone\r\nbalustrades. These pillars are three feet and a half in diameter by\r\nnearly twenty-eight feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the dome is incircled by sixteen Corinthian pillars,\r\nstanding at an equal distance, and lighted by glazed apertures in\r\npart of the intercolumniations. They support a cupola, in the centre\r\nof which is an opening, crowned by another cupola of much more\r\nconsiderable elevation.\r\n\r\nTo survey the interior of the Pantheon, in its present state, is\r\nrather a matter of eager curiosity than of pleasing enjoyment. The\r\nprecautions taken to prevent the fall of the whole building, which\r\nwas apprehended from the almost tottering state of the dome, have\r\nnecessitated the erection of such a quantity of scaffolding, that it\r\nis no easy task to gain an uninterrupted view of its majestic\r\npillars, of the delicate and light foliage of its capitals, and of\r\nits proud and triple canopy. I mounted the ladders, and braved the\r\ndust of stone and plaster, amidst the echoing sound of saws, chisels,\r\nand mallets, at work in different directions.\r\n\r\nMercier is said to have offended several of the partisans of Voltaire\r\nby observing that, through a strange inconsistency, the constant\r\nflatterer not only of royalty in general, but of kings in particular,\r\nand of all the great men and vices of the age in which he lived, here\r\nshares the gratitude of a republic with the _man of nature and\r\ntruth_, as Jean-Jacques is styled on his sepulchral monument. Thus,\r\nin the first instance, says he, a temple, consecrated to stern\r\nrepublican virtue, contains the remains of a great poet who could not\r\nstrike superstition, without wounding morals.--Unquestionably, the\r\n_Pucelle_ is a work, which, like a blight on a promising crop, has\r\ncommitted incalculable ravage among the rising generation.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous inscriptions which now adorn the tomb of\r\nVoltaire, perhaps, at some future distant period, he may experience\r\nthe fate of Mirabeau, and be _dispantheonized_.\r\n\r\nBut why meddle with the cold remains of any great genius? Would it\r\nnot have been more rational to inscribe the name of Rousseau in this\r\nnational temple, and leave his corpse to rot undisturbed, in the _Ile\r\ndes Peupliers_, at Ermenonville.\r\n\r\nThough circumstances prevented me from ascending to the dome, you\r\nwill, no doubt, expect me to say something of its exterior\r\narchitecture. It represents a circular temple, formed by thirty-four\r\npillars, like those of the interior, of the Corinthian order, and\r\neach, base and capital included, thirty-four feet in height by three\r\nfeet and one third in diameter. This colonnade is supported by a\r\ncircular stylobate, which rests on an octagon base, and is surrounded\r\nby a gallery, bordered by an iron balustrade. The cupola, rising\r\nabove the attic, would appear crushed, were not a stranger apprised\r\nthat the pedestal on the top is to be surmounted by a bronze figure\r\nof Fame, twenty-eight feet in height, and weighing fifty-two thousand\r\npounds. The pedestal is encircled by a second gallery at an elevation\r\nof one hundred and sixty-six feet, to reach which you ascend a flight\r\nof four hundred and sixty stone steps. As the Pantheon itself stands\r\non a considerable eminence, the prospect from this gallery is\r\nextensive and commanding.\r\n\r\nThis sumptuous edifice may truly be said to exhibit a monument of the\r\nweakness of man. Like him, before arrived at maturity, it is attacked\r\nby indisposition. The architects, like so many physicians, were not\r\nfor some time agreed as to the seat of the evil. Each proposed his\r\nmeans of cure as the most infallible; But all coincided in one\r\nopinion, that the danger was imminent. Their skill has been exerted,\r\nand, no doubt, with effect; for all apprehension of further mischief\r\nis now removed.\r\n\r\nWhen I was taking a last look at this proud temple, I could not help\r\nregretting that one half of the money already expended on it, had not\r\nbeen appropriated to the erection of airy hospitals in the different\r\nquarters of this populous city. Any one who had formerly visited the\r\n_Hôtel-Dieu_ in Paris would, I am confident, have participated in\r\nthis sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhat strange fatality impels men to persevere in such unprofitable\r\nerections? This was the first question which suggested itself to me,\r\non getting fairly out of the Pantheon. Is it to gratify an excess of\r\nnational vanity, or create a superior degree of admiration in the\r\nmind of foreigners? If so, the aim is missed: for, as majesty, fallen\r\nfrom the pinnacle of power, becomes more interesting, so do ruins\r\ninspire greater veneration than the most pompous structure, towering\r\nin the splendour of its perfection. Experience tells us that every\r\ntruncated pillar, every remnant, in short, of past grandeur, rouses\r\nattention, and speaks home to the contemplative mind; while these\r\nmodern edifices, however firmly erect on their base, excite,\r\ncomparatively speaking, but a feeble interest. In future ages,\r\nperhaps, when the Pantheon of Paris shall be prostrate on the ground,\r\nand the wreck of its stately dome be overrun with moss and ivy, it\r\nmay, probably, attract as much notice as the far-tamed temple of\r\nJupiter-Ammon.\r\n\r\nP.S. On the evening of the 8th, BONAPARTE left Paris for Lyons, where\r\nTALLEYRAND, Minister for foreign affairs, has been for some days\r\npreparing for the great event which is expected to take place. When a\r\npublic measure is in agitation, the result is generally anticipated\r\nby the eagerness of mankind; and whispers the least audible are\r\nmagnified into authentic information. Those even who may be presumed\r\nto derive their intelligence from the best sources, not unfrequently\r\nmisconceive what they have heard, and consequently mislead others. I\r\nwill not, however, mislead you, by repeating any of the rumours in\r\ncirculation here: in a short time, the _Moniteur_ will, no doubt,\r\nexplain the real object of this journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 12,1802._\r\n\r\nAs no city in Europe presents so many advantages as this for the\r\ncultivation of literature, arts, and sciences, it is not surprising\r\nthat it should contain great numbers of literati, artists, and men of\r\nscience, who form themselves into different associations.\r\nIndependently of the National Institute, Paris can boast of several\r\nother\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of those held in most esteem.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ PHILOTECHNIQUE.\r\nSOCIÉTÉ LIBRE DES SCIENCES, LETTRES, ET ARTS.\r\nATHÉNÉE (_ci-devant_ LYCÉE) DES ARTS.\r\nSOCIÉTÉ PHILOMATIQUE.\r\nSOCIÉTÉ ACADÉMIQUE DES SCIENCES.\r\nSOCIÉTÉ GALVANIQUE.\r\nSOCIÉTÉ DES BELLES-LETTRES.\r\nACADÉMIE DE LÉGISLATION.\r\nOBSERVATEURS DE L'HOMME.\r\nATHÉNÉE DE PARIS, _ci-devant_ LYCÉE RÉPUBLICAIN.\r\n\r\nThough, in all these societies, you may meet with a great number of\r\nestimable men, many of whose names may be found in the major part of\r\nthem, yet that which holds the first rank in the public esteem, as\r\nwell from the respectability of the members of whom it is composed,\r\nas from the proofs of talents which are necessary in order to be\r\nadmitted into it, is the\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ PHILOTECHNIQUE.\r\n\r\nIndeed, almost all its members are men whose works hove rendered them\r\ncelebrated throughout Europe. Hitherto, with the exception of the\r\nNational Institute, this is the only society to which the government\r\nhas granted the honour of receiving it as a body, or by deputation,\r\non solemn occasions; and by that alone, it has _nationalized_, at\r\nleast tacitly, its institution. It is also the only one which, to the\r\npresent moment, has preserved the right of holding its public and\r\nprivate sittings in the _Louvre_, since that palace has been ordered\r\nto be wholly evacuated. A report has been spread that the hall of the\r\n_ci-devant_ French Academy is destined for it; but as yet nothing is\r\ndetermined in this respect.\r\n\r\nIts number is confined to sixty resident members, and twenty free\r\nassociates or veterans. It is necessary to have been ten years among\r\nthe resident members, in order to have a right to be admitted into\r\nthe number of the twenty free associates, who enjoy prerogatives,\r\nwithout being bound to take a part in the labours of the society.\r\nThis favour, however, may be granted to those who are for a time\r\ncalled from Paris by public functions, such as embassies,\r\nprefectures, &c.\r\n\r\nThis society meets on the 2nd, 12th and 22nd of every month at seven\r\no'clock in the evening. Its various committees have their particular\r\ndays for assembling. Its officers consist of a President, a\r\nVice-President, a general and perpetual Secretary, a temporary\r\nSecretary, a Treasurer, and a Keeper of the records.\r\n\r\nIt holds its public sittings at noon on the last Sunday of the second\r\nmonth of every _trimestre_, or quarter of the republican year,\r\nnamely, Brumaire, Pluviôse, Floréal, and Thermidor.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of men of science, literati, and artists; but,\r\nresembling a family rather than a society, its principles of\r\nfriendship admit of no classes. On the 19th of every month, it\r\ncelebrates its foundation by an entertainment, at which its members\r\nhave the liberty of introducing their friends.\r\n\r\nIt reckons among its members, in the Sciences, LACÉPÈDE, FOURCROY,\r\nCUVIER, GEOFFROY, ROTROU, RUEL, LE CLERC, GAUTHEROT, GINGEMBRE, &c.\r\n\r\nIn Literature, BOUFFLERS, LEGOUVÉ, ANDRIEUX, JOSEPH LAVALLÉE, MARIUS\r\nARNAUD, SICARD, GUILLARD, GUICHARD, FRANÇOIS DE NEUFCHÂTEAU,\r\nMARGOURIT, RENAUD DE ST. JEAN-D'ANGELY, AMAURY and ALEXANDRE DUVAL,\r\nSAY, DESPRÉS, MARSOLIER, BROUSSE, DES FAUCHERETS, PIGAULT LE BRUN,\r\nPOUGENS, FRAMERY, COLIN D'HARLEVILLE, LA CHABEAUSSIÈRE, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the Arts, viz. Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Music,\r\nDeclamation, and Dancing, REGNAULT, VALENCIENNES, SILVESTRE the\r\nFather, BARBIER the elder, BARTHELEMY, SAUVAGE, LETHIERS, PAJOU,\r\nCHAUDET, NORRY, LEGRAND, BIENAIMÉ, DECOTTE, director of the medals,\r\nFOUBERT, honorary administrator of the Central Museum, LA RIVE the\r\ntragedian, GOSSEC, MARTINI, LE SUEUR, GAVAUX, KALKBRUMER, ADRIEN the\r\nelder, GARDEL, &c.\r\n\r\nThe general and perpetual Secretary is JOSEPH LAVALLÉE.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ, LIBRE DES. SCIENCES, LETTRES, ET ARTS.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of the junction of the old _Museum of Paris_ and of\r\nthe Society called that of the _Nine Sisters_. It is divided into\r\nclasses, is unlimited in the number of its members, admits associated\r\ncorrespondents and foreigners, holds its private sittings at the\r\n_Oratoire_ in the _Rue St. Honoré_, every Thursday, and its public\r\nones at six o'clock in the evening on the 9th of the first months of\r\nthe _trimestre_; namely, Vendémiaire, Nivôse, Germinal, and Messidor.\r\nIts officers consist of a President, taken alternately from the three\r\nclasses, of two temporary Secretaries, a Treasurer, and a Keeper of\r\nthe records.\r\n\r\nThis Society is modelled a little too much after the Institute, and\r\nit is easy to see that the former aims at rivaling the latter. This\r\n_esprit de corps_, which cannot well be perceived but by nice\r\nobservers, has this advantage; it inspires a sort of emulation. But\r\nthe society having neglected to limit the number of its members, and\r\nhaving thereby deprived itself of the means of appearing difficult as\r\nto admission, it thence results that its labours are not equally\r\nstamped with the impression of real talent; and if, in fact, it be\r\nambitious, that is a great obstacle to its views.\r\n\r\nATHENÉE (_ci-devant_ LYCÉE) DES ARTS.[1]\r\n\r\nIn imitation of our Royal Society, it comprises not only the\r\nsciences, literature, and the arts, but also arts and trades,\r\nmechanics, inventions, &c. Its members are not idle, and they are a\r\nuseful body, as they excite emulation by medals, civic crowns,\r\npremiums, and rewards. Their number is considerable and unlimited; a\r\ncondition which is an evil in the last-mentioned society, and a good\r\nin this, whose nature is not so much to shine as to encourage\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIt was for a while in disrepute, because DESAUDRAY, the director who\r\nfounded it, exercised over it a tyrannic sway; it has succeeded in\r\ngetting rid of him, and, since then, several persons of merit, who\r\nhad before kept aloof, aspire to the honour of being admitted into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor some time past it has adopted a custom, too obsequious and\r\nabsurd, of choosing none but ministers for its Presidents. By this,\r\nit exposes its liberty and its opinion, and gives itself chains, the\r\nweight of which it will feel some day, when too late to shake them\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIt holds its general sittings at the _Oratoire_ every Monday, when it\r\nhears the reports of its numerous committees, who have their\r\nparticular days for meeting. Its public sittings are held at the same\r\nplace, but at no fixed periods.\r\n\r\nIts officers consist of a President, a Vice-President, two\r\nSecretaries, three Conservators, a Treasurer, and a Keeper of the\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nIt has associated correspondents throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ PHILOMATIQUE.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly devoted to natural, physical, and mathematical sciences.\r\nIt assembles on Fridays, in the _Rue d'Anjou_, _Faubourg St.\r\nGermain_. It has no public sittings; but is merely a private meeting\r\nof men of learning, who publish once a month a _bulletin_ very\r\nimportant to the sciences, and to be commended, besides, for its\r\ncomposition, perspicuity, and conciseness. This publication is of a\r\n4to size, consists of a single sheet of print, and has for its title\r\n_Bulletin des Sciences par la Société Philomatique_.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ ACADÉMIQUE DES SCIENCES.\r\n\r\nThis Society is recently formed: It employs itself on the Sciences\r\nonly; has not yet held any public sittings, nor published any\r\nmemoirs. Consequently, nothing can yet be said of its labours, or\r\ninterior regulation.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ GALVANIQUE.\r\n\r\nIts name indicates the sole object of its labours. It is newly\r\nformed, and composed of men eminently distinguished in Medicine and\r\nPhysics. It has called in a few literati. Its officers are the same\r\nin the other Societies. It holds its sittings at the _Oratoire_ every\r\nTuesday at eleven o'clock in the morning. Its labours are pursued\r\nwith ardour and it has already made several important experiments. It\r\nannounces zeal, and talents, as well as-great defects, and aspires to\r\nfame, perhaps, a little too much; but it may still maintain its\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ DES BELLES-LETTRES.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat frivolous. Public sittings every month. Half poetry,\r\nhalf music. It meets at the _Oratoire_ every Wednesday at seven\r\no'clock in the evening. It arose from a small emigration of the\r\n_Lycée des Arts_, at this day _l'Athénée_, during the tyranny of\r\nDESAUDRAY, and originally bore the title of _Rosati_. A few men of\r\nmerit, a great number of youths, and some useless members. Too many\r\nfutile readings, too many fugitive verses, too many little\r\nrivalships. It is faulty on account of its regulations, the basis of\r\nwhich is weak, and it exhibits too much parsimony in its expenses. It\r\nhas not enough of that public consideration which perpetuates\r\nestablishments of this description. Under such circumstances, it is\r\nto be apprehended that it will not support itself.\r\n\r\nACADÉMIE DE LÉGISLATION.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine institution, recently founded. It is composed of the\r\nmost celebrated lawyers, and a few distinguished literati. It meets\r\non the first of every month, gives every day courses of lectures on\r\nall the branches of jurisprudence to a great number of pupils; has\r\nestablished conferences, where these pupils form themselves to the\r\nart of speaking, by pleading on given points of law. It publishes two\r\nperiodical works every month, the one entitled, _Bulletin de\r\nJurisprudence_ and the other, _Annales de Jurisprudence._ The\r\npreliminary discourse of the first volume of the latter is by JOSEPH\r\nLAVALLÉE, and has done him considerable credit. He is, however, a\r\nliterary character, and not a lawyer.\r\n\r\nThis academy has officers of the same description as those of the\r\nother Societies. Senator LANJUINAIS is the President at this moment.\r\nIt occupies the _Hôtel de la Briffe_, _Quai Voltaire_.\r\n\r\nSOCIÉTÉ DES OBSERVATEURS DE L'HOMME.\r\n\r\nIt assembles at the _Hôtel de la Rochefoucauld_, _Rue de Seine_,\r\n_Faubourg St. Germain,_ and is composed of very estimable men. Its\r\nlabours, readings, and discussions are too metaphysical. In point of\r\nofficers, it is formed like the other Societies. Citizen JUAFFRET is\r\nperpetual Secretary.\r\n\r\nATHÉNÉE DE PARIS, _ci-devant_ LYCÉE RÉPUBLICAIN.\r\n\r\nThis society has survived the revolutionary storm, having been\r\nestablished as far back as the year 1787. According to the\r\n_programme_ published for the present year 1802, its object is to\r\npropagate the culture of the sciences and literature; to make known\r\nthe useful improvements in the arts; to afford pleasure to persons of\r\nall ages, by presenting to every one such attractions as may suit his\r\ntaste, and to unite in literary conferences the charms of the mildest\r\nof human occupations.\r\n\r\nTo strangers, the _Athénée_ holds out many advantages. On being\r\npresented by one of the founders or a subscriber, and paying the\r\nannual subscription of 96 francs, you receive an admission-ticket,\r\nwhich, however, is not transferrable. This entitles you to attend\r\nseveral courses of lectures by some of the most eminent professors,\r\nsuch as FOURCROY, CUVIER, LA HARPE, DÉGÉRANDO, SUË, HASSENFRATZ,\r\nLEGRAND, &c. The subjects for the year are as follows:\r\n\r\nExperimental Physics, Chymistry, Natural History, Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology, Botany, Technology or the application of sciences to arts\r\nand trades, Literature, Moral Philosophy, Architecture, together with\r\nthe English, Italian, and German languages.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are always delivered twice, and not unfrequently thrice\r\na day, in a commodious room, provided with all the apparatus\r\nnecessary for experiments. On a Sunday, an account of the order in\r\nwhich they are to be given in the course of the following week, is\r\nsent to every subscriber. There is no half-subscription, nor any\r\nadmission _gratis_; but ladies pay no more than 48 francs for their\r\nannual ticket.\r\n\r\nIndependently of so many sources of instruction, the _Athénée_, as is\r\nexpressed in the _programme_, really affords to subscribers the\r\nresources and charms of a numerous and select society. The\r\napartments, which are situated near the _Palais du Tribunat_, in the\r\n_Rue du Lycée_, are open to them from nine o'clock in the morning to\r\neleven at night. Several rooms are appropriated to conversation; one\r\nof which, provided with a piano-forte and music, serves as a\r\nrendezvous for the ladies. The subscribers have free access to the\r\nlibrary, where they find the principal literary and political\r\njournals and papers, both French and others, as well as every new\r\npublication of importance. A particular room, in which silence is\r\nduly observed, is set apart for reading.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This Society has laid aside the title of _Lyceum_ since\r\nthe decree of the government, which declares that this denomination\r\nis to be applied only to the establishments for public instruction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 13, 1802._\r\n\r\nI have spoken to you of palaces, museum, churches, bridges, public\r\ngardens, playhouses, &c. as they have chanced to fall under my\r\nobservation; but there still remain houses of more than one\r\ndescription which I have not yet noticed, though they are certainly\r\nmore numerous here than in any other city in Europe. I shall now\r\nspeak of\r\n\r\nCOFFEEHOUSES.\r\n\r\nTheir number in Paris has been reckoned to exceed seven hundred; but\r\nthey are very far from enjoying a comparative degree of reputation.\r\nCelebrity is said to be confined to about a dozen only, which have\r\nrisen into superior consequence from various causes. Except a few\r\nresorted to by the literati or wits of the day, or by military\r\nofficers, they are, in general, the rendezvous of the idle, and the\r\nrefuge of the needy. This is so true, that a frequenter of a\r\ncoffeehouse scarcely ever lights a fire in his own lodging during the\r\nwhole winter. No sooner has he quitted his bed, and equipped himself\r\nfor the day, than he repairs to his accustomed haunt, where he\r\narrives about ten o'clock in the morning, and remains till eleven at\r\nnight, the hour at which coffeehouses are shut up, according to the\r\nregulation of the police. Not unfrequently persons of this\r\ndescription make a cup of coffee, mixed with milk, with the addition\r\nof a penny-roll, serve for dinner; and, be their merit what it may,\r\nthey are seldom so fortunate as to be consoled by the offer of a rich\r\nman's table.\r\n\r\nHere, no person who wishes to be respected, thinks of lounging in a\r\ncoffeehouse, because it not only shews him to be at a loss to spend\r\nhis time, which may fairly be construed into a deficiency of\r\neducation or knowledge, but also implies an absolute want of\r\nacquaintance with what is termed good company. Certain it is that,\r\nwith the exceptions before-mentioned, a stranger must not look for\r\ngood company in a coffee-house in Paris; if he does, he will find\r\nhimself egregiously disappointed.\r\n\r\nHaving occasion to see an advertisement in an English newspaper, I\r\nwent a few evenings ago to one of the most distinguished places of\r\nthis sort in the _Palais du Tribunat_: the room was extremely\r\ncrowded. In five minutes, one of the company whom I had seen taking\r\nout his watch on my entrance, missed it; and though many of the\r\nby-standers afterwards said they had no doubt that a person of\r\ngentlemanly exterior, who stood near him, had taken it, still it\r\nwould have been useless to charge that person with the fact, as the\r\nwatch had instantly gone through many hands, and the supposed\r\naccomplices had been observed to decamp with uncommon expedition.\r\nWhat diverted me not a little, was that the person suspected coolly\r\ndescanted on the imprudence of taking out a valuable watch in a crowd\r\nof strangers; and, after declaiming the most virulent terms against\r\nthe dishonesty of mankind; he walked away very quietly.\r\nNotwithstanding his appearance and manner were so much in his favour,\r\nhe had no sooner affected his retreat than some subalterns of the\r\npolice, not thief-takers, but _mouchards_ or spies, some of whom are\r\nto be met with in every principal coffeehouse, cautioned the master\r\nof the house against suffering his presence in future, as he was a\r\nnotorious adventurer.\r\n\r\nYou must not, however, imagine from this incident, that a man cannot\r\nenter a coffeehouse in Paris, without being a sufferer from the\r\ndepredations of the nimble-fingered gentry. Such instances are not, I\r\nbelieve, very frequent here; and though it is universally allowed\r\nthat this capital abounds with adventurers and pickpockets of every\r\ndescription, I am of opinion that there is far less danger to be\r\napprehended from them than from their archetypes in London. Everyone\r\nknows that, in our refined metropolis, a lady of fashion cannot give\r\na ball or a rout, without engaging Mr. Townsend, or some other Bow\r\nstreet officer, to attend in her ball, in order that his presence may\r\noperate as a check on the audacity of knavish intruders.\r\n\r\nThe principle coffeehouses here are fitted up with taste and\r\nelegance. Large mirrors form no inconsiderable part of their\r\ndecoration. There are no partitions to divide them into boxes. The\r\ntables are of marble; the benches and stools are covered with Utrecht\r\nvelvet. In winter, an equal degree of warmth is preserved in them by\r\nmeans of a large stove in the centre, which, from its figure, is an\r\nornamental piece of furniture; while, in summer, the draught of air\r\nwhich it maintains, contributes not a little to cool the room. In the\r\nevening, they are lighted by _quinquets_ in a brilliant manner.\r\n\r\nFormerly, every coffeehouse in Paris used to have its chief orator;\r\nin those of the more remote part of the suburbs you might, I am\r\ninformed, hear a journeyman tailor or shoemaker hold forth on various\r\ntopics. With the revolution, politics were introduced; but, at the\r\npresent day, that is a subject which seems to be entirely out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn some coffeehouses, where literati and critics assemble, authors\r\nand their works are passed in review, and to each is assigned his\r\nrank and estimation. When one of these happens to have been checked\r\nin his dramatic career by an _undiscerning_ public, he becomes, in\r\nhis turn, the most merciless of critics.\r\n\r\nIn many of these places, the \"busy hum\" is extremely tiresome;\r\nGerman, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Russ, together with English\r\nand French, all spoken at the same time and in the same room, make a\r\nconfusion of tongues as great almost as that which reigned at Babel.\r\nIn addition to the French newspapers, those of England and Germany\r\nmay be read; but as they are often bespoke by half a dozen persons in\r\nsuccession, it requires no small degree of patience to wait while\r\nthese quidnuncs are conning over every paragraph.\r\n\r\nIndependently of coffee, tea, and chocolate, ices, punch and liqueurs\r\nmay be had in the principal coffeehouses; but nothing in the way of\r\ndinner or supper, except at the subterraneous ones in the _Palais du\r\nTribunat_, though there are many of a rather inferior order where\r\nsubstantial breakfasts in the French style are provided. Whether\r\nVoltaire's idea be just, that coffee clears the brain, and stimulates\r\nthe genius, I will not pretend to determine: but if this be really\r\nthe case, it is no wonder that the French are so lively and full of\r\ninvention; for coffee is an article of which they make an uncommon\r\nconsumption. Indeed, if Fame may be credited, the prior of a\r\nmonastery in Arabia, on the word of a shepherd who had remarked that\r\nhis goats were particularly frisky when they had eaten the berries of\r\nthe coffee-tree, first made a trial of their virtue on the monks of\r\nhis convent, in order to prevent them from sleeping during divine\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, Soliman Aga, ambassador of the Porte to Lewis XIV,\r\nin 1669, was the first who introduced the use of coffee in Paris.\r\nDuring a residence of ten years in the French capital, he had\r\nconciliated the friendship of many persons of distinction, and the\r\nladies in particular took a pleasure in visiting him. According to\r\nthe custom of his country, he presented them with coffee; and this\r\nbeverage, however disgusting from its colour and bitterness, was well\r\nreceived, because it was offered by a foreigner, in beautiful china\r\ncups, on napkins ornamented with gold fringe. On leaving the\r\nambassador's parties, each of the guests, in the enthusiasm of\r\nnovelty, cried up coffee, and took means to procure it. A few years\r\nafter, (in 1672) one Paschal, an Armenian, first opened, at the\r\n_Foire St. Germain_, and, afterwards on the _Quai de l'École_, a shop\r\nsimilar to those which he had seen in the Levant, and called his new\r\nestablishment _café_. Other Levantines followed his example; but, to\r\nfix the fickle Parisian, required a coffeeroom handsomely decorated.\r\nPROCOPE acted on this plan, and his house was successively frequented\r\nby Voltaire, Piron, Fontenelle, and St. Foix.\r\n\r\nAs drinking, which was then in vogue, was pursued less on account of\r\nthe pleasure which it afforded, than for the sake of society, the\r\nFrench made no hesitation in deserting the tavern for the\r\ncoffeehouse. But, in making this exchange, it has been remarked, by\r\nthe observers of the day, that they have not only lost their taste\r\nfor conviviality, but are become more reserved and insincere than\r\ntheir forefathers, whose hearts expanded by the free use of the\r\ngenerous juice of the grape; thus verifying the old maxim, _in vino\r\nveritas._\r\n\r\nNo small attraction to a Parisian coffeehouse is a pretty female to\r\npreside in the bar, and in a few I have seen very handsome women;\r\nthough this post is commonly assigned to the mistress or some\r\nconfidential female relation. Beset as they are from morn to night by\r\nan endless variety of flatterers, the virtue of a Lucretia could\r\nscarcely resist such incessant temptation. In general, they are\r\ncoquetish; but, without coquetry, would they be deemed qualified for\r\ntheir employment?\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, I remember, in the _ci-devant Palais Royal_, a\r\ncoffeehouse called _Le café mécanique_. The mechanical contrivance,\r\nwhence it derived its name, was of the most simple nature. The tables\r\nstood on hollow cylinders, the tops of which, resembling a salver\r\nwith its border, were level with the plane of the table, but\r\nconnected with the kitchen underneath. In the bar sat a fine, showy\r\nlady, who repeated your order to the attendants below, by means of a\r\nspeaking-trumpet. Presently the superficial part of the salver,\r\ndescended through the cylinder, and reascending immediately, the\r\narticle called for made its appearance. This _café méchanique_ did\r\nnot long remain in being, as it was not found to answer the\r\nexpectation of the projector. But besides six or seven coffeehouses\r\non the ground-floor of the _Palais du Tribunat_, there are also\r\nseveral subterraneous ones now open.\r\n\r\nIn one of these, near the _Théâtre Français,_ is a little stage, on\r\nwhich farces, composed for the purpose, are represented _gratis_. In\r\nanother, is an orchestra consisting entirely of performers belonging\r\nto the National Institution of the Blind. In a third, on the north\r\nside of the garden, are a set of musicians, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental, who apparently never tire; for I am told they never\r\ncease to play and sing, except to retune their instruments. Here a\r\nfemale now and then entertains the company with a solo on the French\r\nhorn. To complete the sweet melody, a merry-andrew habited _à la\r\nsauvage_, \"struts his hour\" on a place about six feet in length, and\r\nperforms a thousand ridiculous antics, at the same time flogging and\r\nbeating alternately a large drum, the thunder-like sound of which is\r\nalmost loud enough to give every auditor's brain a momentary\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\nA fourth subterraneous coffeehouse in the _Palais du Tribunat_ is\r\nkept by a ventriloquist, and here many a party are amused by one of\r\ntheir number being repeatedly led into a mistake, in consequence of\r\nbeing ignorant of the faculty possessed by the master of the house.\r\nThis man seems to have no small share of humour, and exercises it\r\napparently much to his advantage. In three visits which I paid to his\r\ncellar, the crowd was so great that it was extremely difficult to\r\napproach the scene of action, so as to be able to enjoy the effect of\r\nhis ludicrous deceptions.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, well acquainted with the proper time for visiting\r\nevery place of public resort in Paris, conducted me to all these\r\nsubterraneous coffeehouses on a Sunday evening, when they were so\r\nfull that we had some difficulty to find room to stand, for to find a\r\nseat was quite impossible. Such a diversity of character I never\r\nbefore witnessed in the compass of so small a space. However, all was\r\nmirth and good-humour. I know not how they contrive to keep these\r\nplaces cool in summer; for, in the depth of winter, a more than\r\ngenial warmth prevails in them, arising from the confined breath of\r\nsuch a concourse. On approaching the stair-case, if the orchestra be\r\nsilent, the entrance of these regions of harmony is announced by a\r\nheat which can be compared only to the true Sirocco blast such as you\r\nhave experienced at Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 15, 1802._\r\n\r\nAs after one of those awful and violent convulsions of nature which\r\nrend the bosom of the earth, and overthrow the edifices standing on\r\nits surface, men gradually repair the mischief it has occasioned, so\r\nthe French, on the ruins of the ancient colleges and universities,\r\nwhich fell in the shock of the revolution, have from time to time\r\nreared new seminaries of learning, and endeavoured to organize, on a\r\nmore liberal and patriotic scale, institutions for\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe vast field which the organization of public instruction presents\r\nto the imagination has, as may be, supposed, given birth to a great\r\nnumber of systems more or less practicable; but, hitherto, it should\r\nseem that political oscillations have imprinted on all the new\r\ninstitutions a character of weakness which, if it did not absolutely\r\nthreaten speedy ruin, announced at least that they would not be\r\nlasting. When the germs of discord prevailed, it was not likely that\r\nmen's minds should be in that tranquil state necessary for the\r\nreestablishment of public seminaries, to lay the foundations of\r\nwhich, in a solid and durable manner, required the calm of peace and\r\nthe forgetfulness of misfortune.\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the colleges and universities existing under\r\nthe monarchy, and to which the _Collège de France_ in Paris is the\r\nsole exception, the National Convention, by a decree of the 24th of\r\nNivôse, year III (14th of January 1795) established _Normal_ Schools\r\nthroughout the Republic. Professors and teachers were appointed to\r\nthem; and it was intended that, in these nurseries, youth should be\r\nprepared for the higher schools, according to the new plan of\r\ninstruction. However, in less than a year, these _Normal_ Schools\r\nwere shut up; and, by a law of the 3d of Brumaire, year IV (25th of\r\nOctober, 1796) Primary, Secondary, and Central Schools were ordered\r\nto be established in every department.\r\n\r\nIn the Primary Schools, reading, writing, and arithmetic formed the\r\nchief part of the instruction. Owing to various causes, the Secondary\r\nSchools, I understand, were never established. In the Central\r\nSchools, the internal regulation was to be as follows.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the instruction was divided into three classes or\r\nsections. In the first, were taught drawing, natural history, and\r\nancient and modern languages. In the second, mathematics, physics,\r\nand chymistry. In the third, universal grammar, the fine arts,\r\nhistory, and legislation. Into the first class the pupils were to be\r\nreceived at the age of twelve; into the second, at fourteen; and into\r\nthe third, at sixteen. In each Central School were to be a public\r\nlibrary, a botanic garden, and an apparatus of chymical and physical\r\ninstruments. The professors were to be examined and chosen by a _Jury\r\nof Instruction_, and that choice confirmed by the administration of\r\nthe department.\r\n\r\nThe government, in turning its attention to the present state of the\r\npublic schools, and comparing them with the wants and wishes of the\r\ninhabitants of the Republic, has found that the Primary Schools have\r\nbeen greatly neglected, and that the Central Schools have not been of\r\nso much utility as was expected. Alarmed at the consequences likely\r\nto be produced by a state of things which leaves a great part of the\r\npresent generation destitute of the first rudiments of knowledge, the\r\ngovernment has felt that the reorganization of these schools is\r\nbecome an urgent duty, and that it is impossible to delay longer to\r\ncarry it into execution.\r\n\r\nThe _Special_ Schools of Arts and Sciences are mostly confined to\r\nParis. The other rich and populous cities of the Republic have\r\nundoubtedly a claim to similar institutions. There is at present no\r\nSchool of Jurisprudence, and but one of Medicine.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated FOURCROY[1] has been some time engaged in drawing up a\r\nplan for the improvement of public instruction. In seeking a new mode\r\nof teaching appropriate to the present state of knowledge and to the\r\ngenius of the French nation, he has thought it necessary to depart\r\nfrom the beaten track. Enlightened by the past, he has rejected the\r\nancient forms of the universities, whose philosophy and acquirements,\r\nfor half a century past, called for reformation, and no longer kept\r\npace with the progress of reason. In the Central Schools he saw\r\ninstitutions few in number, and too uniformly organized for\r\ndepartments varying in population, resources, and means. He has,\r\nnevertheless, taken what was good in each of these two systems\r\nsuccessively adopted, and removed their abuses. Without losing sight\r\nof the success due to good masters and skilful professors, he has,\r\nabove all, thought of the means of insuring the success of the new\r\nschools by the competition of the scholars. He is of opinion that to\r\nfound literary and scientific institutions on a solid basis, it is\r\nnecessary to begin by attaching to them pupils, and filling the\r\nclasses with students, in order not to run the risk of filling them\r\nwith professors. Such is the object which FOURCROY wishes to attain,\r\nby creating a number of national pensions, so considerable that their\r\nfunds, when distributed in the Lyceums, may be sufficient for their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to these ideas, the following is said to be the outline of\r\nthe new organization of public instruction. It is to be divided into\r\nfour classes; viz. Primary Schools, Secondary Schools, Lyceums, and\r\nSpecial Schools.\r\n\r\nPRIMARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nA Primary School may belong to several _communes_ at a time,\r\naccording to the population and the locality of these _communes_.\r\n\r\nThe teachers are to be chosen by the mayors and municipal councils.\r\n\r\nThe under-prefects are to be specially charged with the organization\r\nof these schools, and give an account of their state, once a month,\r\nto the prefects.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nEvery school established in the _commune_ or kept by private\r\nindividuals, in which are taught the Latin and French languages, the\r\nfirst principles of geography, history and mathematics, is to be\r\nconsidered as a Secondary School.\r\n\r\nThe government promises to encourage the establishment of Secondary\r\nSchools, and reward the good instruction that shall be given in them,\r\neither by granting a spot for keeping them, or by the distribution of\r\ngratuitous places in the Lyceums, to such of the pupils as shall have\r\ndistinguished themselves most, and by gratifications to the fifty\r\nmasters who shall have qualified most pupils for the Lyceums.\r\n\r\nNo Secondary School is to be established without the authority of the\r\ngovernment. The Secondary Schools and private schools, whose\r\ninstruction is found superior to that of the Primary Schools, are to\r\nbe placed under the superintendance and particular inspection of the\r\nprefects.\r\n\r\nLYCEUMS.\r\n\r\nThere is to be one Lyceum at least in the district of every tribunal\r\nof appeal.\r\n\r\nHere are to be taught ancient languages, rhetoric, logic, morality,\r\nand the elements of the mathematical and physical sciences. To these\r\nare to be added drawing, military exercises and the agreeable arts.\r\n\r\nInstruction is to be given to the pupils placed here by the\r\ngovernment, to those of the Secondary Schools admitted through\r\ncompetition, to those whose parents may put them here as boarders,\r\nand also to day-scholars.\r\n\r\nIn each Lyceum is to be a director, who is to have immediately under\r\nhim a censor of studies, and an administrator who are all to be\r\nnominated by the First Consul.\r\n\r\nIn the former institutions, which are to be replaced by these new\r\nones, a vigilant eye was not constantly kept on the state of the\r\nschools themselves, nor on that of the studies pursued in them.\r\nAccording to the new plan, three inspectors-general, appointed by the\r\nFirst Consul, are to visit them carefully, and report to the\r\ngovernment their situation, success, and defects. This new\r\nsupervisorship is to be, as it were, the key-stone of the arch, and\r\nto keep all the parts connected.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and highest degree of public instruction is to be acquired\r\nin the\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThis is the name to be applied to those of the upper schools, where\r\nare particularly taught, and in the most profound manner, the useful\r\nsciences, jurisprudence, medicine, natural history, &c. But schools\r\nof this kind must not be confounded with the Schools for Engineers,\r\nArtillery, Bridges and Highways, Hydrography, &c. which, _special_ as\r\nthey are essentially, in proportion to the sciences particularly\r\ntaught in them, are better described, however, by the name of\r\n_Schools for Public Services_, on account of the immediate utility\r\nderived from them by the government.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Special_ Schools now in existence, which are to\r\nbe kept up, new ones are to be established in the following\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\nTen Schools of Jurisprudence. These useful institutions, which have\r\nbeen abolished during the last ten years, are, by a new organization,\r\nto resume the importance that they had lost long before the\r\nrevolution. The pupils are to be examined in a manner more certain\r\nfor determining their capacity, and better calculated for securing\r\nthe degree of confidence to be reposed in those men to whose\r\nknowledge and integrity individuals are sometimes forced to intrust\r\ntheir character and fortune.\r\n\r\nThree new Schools of Medicine, in addition to the three at present in\r\nbeing. These also are to be newly organized in the most perfect\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical and physical sciences have made too great a progress\r\nin France, their application to the useful arts, to the public\r\nservice, and to the general prosperity, has been too direct, says\r\nFOURCROY, for it not to be necessary to diffuse the taste for them,\r\nand to open new asylums where the advantages resulting from them may\r\nbe extended, and their progress promoted. There are therefore to be\r\nfour new _Special_ Schools of Natural History, Physics, and\r\nChymistry, and also a _Special_ School devoted to transcendent\r\nMathematics.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical and chymical arts, so long taught in several\r\nuniversities in Germany under the name of _technology_, are to have\r\ntwo _Special_ Schools, placed in the cities most rich in industry and\r\nmanufactures. These schools, generally wished for, are intended to\r\ncontribute to the national prosperity by the new methods which they\r\nwill make known, the new instruments and processes which they will\r\nbring into use, the good models of machines which they will\r\nintroduce, in a word, by every means that mechanics and chymistry can\r\nfurnish to the arts.\r\n\r\nA School of Public Economy, enlightened by Geography and History, is\r\nto be opened for those who may be desirous to investigate the\r\nprinciples of governments, and the art of ascertaining their\r\nrespective interests. In this school it is proposed to unite such an\r\nassemblage of knowledge as has not yet existed in France.\r\n\r\nTo the three principal schools of the arts dependent on design, which\r\nare at present open, is to be added a fourth, become necessary since\r\nthose arts bring back to France the pure taste of the beautiful\r\nforms, of which Greece has left such perfect models.\r\n\r\nIn each of the observatories now in use is to be a professor of\r\nastronomy, and the art of navigation is expected to derive new\r\nsuccour from these schools, most of which are placed in the principal\r\nsea-ports. A knowledge of the heavens and the study of the movements\r\nof the celestial bodies, which every year receives very remarkable\r\naugmentations from the united efforts of the most renowned\r\ngeometricians and the most indefatigable observers, may have a great\r\ninfluence on the progress of civilization. On which account the\r\nFrench government is extremely eager to promote the science of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nThe language of neighbouring nations, with whom the French have such\r\nfrequent intercourse, is to be taught in several Lyceums, as being a\r\nuseful introduction to commerce.\r\n\r\nThe art of war, of which modern times have given such great examples\r\nand such brilliant lessons, is to have its _special_ school, and this\r\nschool, on the plan which it is intended to be established by\r\nreceiving as soldiers youths from the Lyceums, will form for the\r\nFrench armies officers equally skilful in theory as in practice.\r\n\r\nThis new Military School must not be confounded with the old _école\r\nmilitaire_. Independently of its not being destined for a particular\r\nclass, which no longer exists in this country, the mode of\r\ninstruction to be introduced there will render it totally different\r\nfrom the establishment which bore the same name.\r\n\r\nIt is to be composed of five hundred pupils, forming a battalion, and\r\nwho are to be accustomed to military duty and discipline; it is to\r\nhave at least ten professors, charged to teach all the theoretical,\r\npractical, and administrative parts of the art of war, as well as the\r\nhistory of wars and of great captains.\r\n\r\nOf the five hundred pupils of the Special Military School, two\r\nhundred are to be taken from among the national pupils of the\r\nLyceums, in proportion to their number in each of those schools, and\r\nthree hundred from among the boarders and day-scholars, according to\r\nthe examination which they must undergo at the end of their studies.\r\nEvery year one hundred of the former are to be admitted, and two\r\nhundred of the latter. They are to be maintained two years in the\r\nSpecial Military School, at the expense of the Republic. These two\r\nyears are to be considered as part of their military service.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report made of the behaviour and talents of the\r\npupils of the Military School, the government is to provide them with\r\nappointments in the army.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PUPILS.\r\n\r\nThere are to be maintained at the expense of the Republic six\r\nthousand four hundred pupils, as boarders in the Lyceums and Special\r\nSchools.\r\n\r\nOut of these six thousand four hundred boarders, two thousand four\r\nhundred are to be chosen by the government from among the sons of\r\nofficers and public functionaries of the judicial, administrative, or\r\nmunicipal order, who shall have served the Republic with fidelity,\r\nand for ten years only from among the children of citizens belonging\r\nto the departments united to France, although they have neither been\r\nmilitary men nor public functionaries.\r\n\r\nThese two thousand four hundred pupils are to be at least nine years\r\nof age, and able to read and write.\r\n\r\nThe other four thousand are to be taken from double the number of\r\npupils of the Secondary Schools, who, according to an examination\r\nwhere their talents are put in competition, are to be presented to\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe pupils, maintained in the Lyceums, are not to remain there more\r\nthan six years at the expense of the nation. At the end of their\r\nstudies, they are to undergo an examination, after which a fifth of\r\nthem are to be placed in the different Special Schools according to\r\ntheir disposition, in order to be maintained there from two to four\r\nyears at the expense of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe annual cost of all these establishments is estimated at near\r\neight millions of francs, (_circa_ £336,000 sterling) which exceeds\r\nby at least two millions the amount of the charges of the public\r\ninstruction for the few preceding years; but this augmentation, which\r\nwill only take place by degrees, and at soonest in eighteen months,\r\nappears trifling, compared to the advantages likely to result from\r\nthe new system.\r\n\r\nWhenever this plan is carried into execution, what hopes may not\r\nFrance conceive from the youth of the rising generation, who, chosen\r\nfrom among those inclined to study, will, in all probability, rise to\r\nevery degree of fame! The surest pledge of the success of the measure\r\nseems to consist in the spirit of emulation which is to be\r\nmaintained, not only among the pupils, but even among the professors\r\nin the different schools; for emulation, in the career of literature,\r\narts and sciences, leads to fame, and never fails to turn to the\r\nbenefit of society; whereas jealousy, in the road of ambition and\r\nfortune, produces nothing but hatred and discord.\r\n\r\n  \"Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,\r\n  Is emulation in the learn'd and brave.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the plan.[2] In your last letter, you desire that I will\r\nafford you some means of appreciating the essential difference\r\nbetween the old system of education pursued in France, and the basis\r\non which public instruction is now on the point of being reorganised\r\nand established. You must be sensible that the comparison of the two\r\nmodes, were I to enter deeply into the question, would far exceed the\r\nlimits of a letter. But, though I have already extended this to a\r\ncertain length, I can, in a few more lines, enable you to compare and\r\njudge, by informing you, from the best authority, what has been the\r\nspirit which has dictated the new organization.\r\n\r\nThere are very few men who know how to confine themselves within just\r\nbounds. Some yield to the mania of innovation, and imagine that they\r\ncreate only because they destroy and change. Others bend under the\r\nyoke of old habits. Some, solely because they have remained strangers\r\nto the sciences, would wish that youth should be employed only in the\r\nstudy of languages and literature. Others who, no doubt, forget that\r\nevery learned man, who aims at a solid reputation, ought to sacrifice\r\nto the Muses, before he penetrates into the sanctuary of science,\r\nwould wish education to be confined to the study of the exact\r\nsciences, and that youth should be occupied on things, before they\r\nare acquainted with words.\r\n\r\nFor the sole reason that the old system of instruction bore too\r\nexclusively on the study of the learned languages, it was to be\r\nfeared that the new one, through a contrary excess, would proscribe\r\nthe Greek and Latin. The study of these two languages, as FOURCROY\r\nhas observed to me, is not merely useful to those who wish to acquire\r\na thorough knowledge of the French, which has borrowed from them no\r\nsmall number of words, but it is only from the perusal of the great\r\nwriters of antiquity, on whom the best among the moderns have formed\r\nthemselves, that we can imbibe the sentiment of the beautiful, the\r\ntaste, and the rectitude of mind equally necessary, whether we feel\r\nourselves attracted towards eloquence or poetry, or raise ourselves\r\nto the highest conceptions of the physical or mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nAt no time can the instruction given to a youth be otherwise\r\nconsidered than as a preparatory mean, whose object is to anticipate\r\nhis taste and disposition, and enable him to enter with more firmness\r\ninto the career which he is intended to follow.\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive perusal of the plan, of which I have traced you the\r\nleading features, you will be convinced that the study of the\r\nsciences will gain by the new system, without that of literature\r\nbeing in danger of losing. The number of professors is increased, and\r\nyet the period of education is not prolonged. A pupil will always be\r\nat liberty to apply himself more intensely to the branch to which he\r\nis impelled by his particular inclination. He may confine himself to\r\none course of lectures, or attend to several, according to his\r\nintellectual means. He will not be compelled to stop in his career,\r\nmerely because the pupils of his class do not advance. In short,\r\nneither limits nor check have been put to the progress that may be\r\nmade by talent.\r\n\r\nI here give you only a principal idea, but the application of it,\r\nimproved by your sagacity and knowledge, will be sufficient to answer\r\nall the objections which may be started against the new plan of\r\ninstruction, and which, when carefully investigated, may be reduced\r\nto a single one; namely, that literature is sacrificed to the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Counsellor of State, now charged with the direction and\r\nsuperintendance of public instruction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The new organization of public instruction was decreed\r\nby the government on the 11th of Floréal, year X.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 18, 1802._\r\n\r\nOf all the private lodgings in Paris, none certainly can be more\r\nconvenient for the residence of a single man than those of\r\n\r\nMILLINERS.\r\n\r\nI have already said that such is the profession of my landlady.\r\nWhenever I am disposed for a little lively chitchat, I have only to\r\nstep to the next door but one into her _magazin de modes_, where,\r\nlike a favourite courtier, under the old _régime_, I have both _les\r\ngrandes et les petites entrées_, or, in plain English, I may either\r\nintroduce myself by the public front entrance, or slip in by the\r\nprivate back-door.\r\n\r\nHere, twenty damsels are employed in making up head-dresses which are\r\nhourly produced and varied by fashion. Closely confined to the\r\ncounter, with a needle in their hand, they are continually throwing\r\ntheir eyes towards the street. Not a passenger escapes their notice.\r\nThe place the nearest to the window is in the greatest request, as\r\nbeing most favourable for catching the transient homages of the\r\ncrowds of men continually passing and repassing. It is generally\r\noccupied by the beauty of the _magazin_ or warehouse; for it would be\r\nresented as an almost unpardonable offence to term this emporium of\r\ntaste a _boutique_ or shop.\r\n\r\nBefore each of them is a block, on which they form and adjust the\r\ngallant trophy destined to heighten the loveliness of some ambitious\r\nfair who has set her heart on surpassing all her rivals at an\r\napproaching ball. Montesquieu observes, in his Persian letters, that\r\n\"if a lady has taken it into her head to appear at an assembly in a\r\nparticular dress, from that moment fifty persons of the working class\r\nmust no longer sleep, or have time to eat and drink. She commands,\r\nand is obeyed more expeditiously than the king of Persia, because\r\ninterest has greater sway than the most powerful monarch on earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning, some of these damsels wait on the ladies with\r\nbandboxes of millinery. Obliged by their profession to adorn the\r\nheads of other women, they must stifle the secret jealousy of their\r\nsex, and contribute to set off the person of those who not\r\nunfrequently treat them with hauteur. However, they are now and then\r\namply revenged: sometimes the proud rich lady is eclipsed by the\r\nhumble little milliner. The unadorned beauty of the latter destroys\r\nthe made up charms of the coquette: 'tis the triumph of nature over\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIf, perchance, the lover drops in, fatal consequences ensue. His\r\nbelle cannot but lose by the comparison: her complexion appears still\r\nmore artificial beside the natural bloom of the youthful _marchande_.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the silent admirer all at once becomes faithless.\r\n\r\nMany a young Parisian milliner has made a jump from behind the\r\ncounter into a fashionable carriage, even into that of an English\r\npeer. Strange revolution of fortune! In the course of a few days, she\r\nreturns to the same shop to make purchases, holding high her head;\r\nand exulting in her success. Her former mistress, sacrificing her\r\nrage to her interest, assumes a forced complaisance; while her\r\nonce-dear companions are ready to burst with envy.\r\n\r\nMillinery here constitutes a very extensive branch of trade. Nothing\r\nshort of the creative genius of the French could contrive to give,\r\nagain and again, a new form to things the most common. In vain do\r\nfemales of other countries attempt to vie with them; in articles of\r\ntasteful fancy they still remain unrivaled.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris, these studious mistresses of invention give laws to the\r\npolished world. After passing to London, Berlin, Hamburg, and Vienna,\r\ntheir models of fashion are disseminated all over Europe. These\r\nmodels alike travel to the banks of the Neva and the shores of the\r\nPropontis. At Constantinople, they find their way into the seraglio\r\nof the Grand Signior; while, at Petersburg, they are servilely copied\r\nto grace the Empress of Russia. Thus, the fold given to a piece of\r\nmuslin or velvet, the form impressed on a ribband, by the hand of an\r\ningenious French milliner, is repeated among all nations.\r\n\r\nA fashion here does not last a week, before it is succeeded by\r\nanother novelty; for a French woman of _bon ton_, instead of wearing\r\nwhat is commonly worn by others, always aims at appearing in\r\nsomething new. It is unfortunately too true, that the changeableness\r\nof taste and inconstancy of fashion in France furnish an aliment to\r\nthe luxury of other countries; but the principle of this\r\ncommunication is in the luxury of this gay and volatile people.\r\n\r\nYou reproach me with being silent respecting the _bals masqués_ or\r\nmasquerades, mentioned in my enumeration of the amusements of Paris.\r\nThe fact is that a description of them will scarcely furnish matter\r\nfor a few lines, still less a subject for a letter. However, in\r\ncompliance with custom, I have been more than once to the\r\n\r\nBAL DE L'OPÉRA.\r\n\r\nThis is a masquerade frequently given in the winter, at the theatre\r\nof the grand French opera, where the pit is covered over, as that is\r\nof our opera-house in the Haymarket. From the powerful draught of\r\nair, which, coming from behind the scenes, may well be termed _vent\r\nde coulisse_, the room is as cold as the season.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution, masquerades were strictly forbidden, and this\r\nprohibition continued under the directorial government. It is only\r\nsince BONAPARTE'S accession to the post of Chief Magistrate, that the\r\nParisians have been indulged with the liberty of wearing disguises\r\nduring the carnival.\r\n\r\nOf all the amusements in Paris, I have ever thought this the most\r\ntiresome and insipid. But it is the same at the _Bal de l'Opéra_ as\r\nat _Frascati_, _Longchamp_, and other points of attraction here;\r\nevery one is soon tired of them, and yet every one flocks thither. In\r\nfact, what can well be more tiresome than a place where you find\r\npersons masked, without wit or humour? Though, according to the old\r\nFrench saying, \"_I faut avoir bien peu d'esprit pour ne pas en avoir\r\nsous le masque?_\"\r\n\r\nThe men, who at a masquerade here generally go unmasked, think it not\r\nworth while to be even complaisant to the women, who are elbowed,\r\nsqueezed, and carried by the tide from one end of the room to the\r\nother, before they are well aware of it. Dominos are the general\r\ndress. The music is excellent; but it is not the fashion to dance;\r\nand _les femmes de bonne compagnie_, that is, well-bred women, are\r\ncondemned to content themselves with the dust they inhale; for they\r\ndare not quit their mask to take any refreshment. But,\r\nnotwithstanding these inconveniences, it is here reckoned a fine\r\nthing to have been at a _bal masqué_ when the crowd was great, and\r\nthe pressure violent; as the more the ladies have shared in it, the\r\nmore they congratulate themselves on the occasion.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the _grand ton_ was for gentlemen to go to the\r\n_Bal de l'Opéra_ in a full-dress suit of black, and unmasked. Swords\r\nwere here prohibited, as at Bath. This etiquette of dress, however,\r\nrendered not the company more select.\r\n\r\nI remember well that at a masked ball at the Parisian opera, in the\r\nyear 1785, the very first beau I recognized in the room, parading in\r\na _habit de cour_, was my own _perruquier_. As at present, the\r\namusement of the women then consisted in teazing the men; and those\r\nwho had a disposition for intrigue, gave full scope to the impulse of\r\ntheir nature. The _fille entretenue_, the _duchesse_, and the\r\n_bourgeoise_, disguised under a similar domino, were not always\r\ndistinguishable; and I have heard of a certain French marquis, who\r\nwas here laid under heavy contribution for the momentary\r\ngratification of his caprice, though the object of it proved to be no\r\nother than his own _cara sposa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 19, 1802._\r\n\r\nWhen you expressed your impatience to be informed of the dramatic\r\namusements in Paris, I promised to satisfy you as soon as I was able;\r\nfor I knew that you would not be contented with a superficial\r\nexamination. Therefore, in reviewing the principal scenic\r\nestablishments, I shall, as I have done before, exert my endeavours\r\nnot only to make you acquainted with the _best_ performers in every\r\ndepartment, but also with the _best_ stock-pieces, in order that, by\r\ncasting your eye on the _Affiches des Spectacles_, when you visit\r\nthis capital, you may at once form a judgment of the quality and\r\nquantity of the entertainment you are likely to enjoy at the\r\nrepresentation of a particular piece, in which certain performers\r\nmake their appearance. Since the revolution, the custom of printing\r\nthe names of the actors and dancers in each piece, has been\r\nintroduced. Formerly, amateurs often paid their money only to\r\nexperience a disappointment; for, instead of seeing the hero or\r\nheroine that excited their curiosity, they had a bad duplicate, or,\r\nas the French term it, a _double_, imposed on them, more frequently\r\nthrough caprice than any other motive. This is now obviated; and,\r\nexcept in cases of sudden and unforeseen indisposition, you may be\r\ncertain of seeing the best performers whenever their name is\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the theatres, the pieces represented, and the merits\r\nof the performers, I cannot be supposed to be actuated by any\r\nprejudice or partiality whatever. I have, it is true, been favoured\r\nwith the oral criticism of a man of taste, who, as a very old\r\nacquaintance, has generally accompanied me to the different\r\n_spectacles_; but still I have never adopted his sentiments, unless\r\nthe truth of them had been confirmed by my own observation. From him\r\nI have been favoured with a communication of such circumstances\r\nrespecting them as occurred during the revolution, when I was absent\r\nfrom Paris. You may therefore confidently rely on the candour and\r\nimpartiality of my general sketch of the theatres; and if the stage\r\nbe considered as a mirror which reflects the public mind, you will\r\nthence be enabled to appreciate the taste of the Parisians. Without\r\nforgetting that\r\n\r\n  \"_La critique est aisée, mais l'art est difficile_,\"\r\n\r\nI shall indulge the hope that you will be persuaded that truth alone\r\nhas guided my pen in this attempt to trace the attractions of the\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE FRANÇAIS DE LA RÉPUBLIQUE.\r\n\r\nThe house, now occupied by the performers of this theatre, was built\r\nat the beginning of the revolution by the late duke of Orleans, who,\r\naccording to the opinion of those best acquainted with his schemes of\r\nprofit, intended it for the representation of the grand French opera,\r\nfor which, nevertheless, it is not sufficiently spacious.\r\n\r\nIt stands adjoining to the south-west angle of the _Palais du\r\nTribunat_, with its front entrance in the _Rue de la Loi_. Its façade\r\npresents a row of twelve Doric columns, surmounted by as many\r\nCorinthian pilasters, crowned by their entablature. On the first\r\nstory is an exterior gallery; ornamented by an iron balustrade, which\r\nruns the whole length of the façade, and communicates with the lobby.\r\nOn the north side, and at the back of the theatre, on the\r\nground-floor, are several covered galleries, bordered by shops,\r\nwhich communicate with the _Rue St. Honoré_ and the _Palais du\r\nTribunat_.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule, where four stair-cases terminate, is of an elliptic\r\nform, surrounded by three rows of Doric pillars. Above the vestibule,\r\nwhich is on the ground-floor, are the pit and lobby. The inside of\r\nthe house, which is immoderately lofty, presents seven tiers of\r\nboxes, and, in the circumference, six Corinthian pillars. The\r\nornaments, numerously scattered, are in relief. At a certain\r\nelevation, the plan of the house is changed by a recess made facing\r\nthe stage. Two angels, above the stage-boxes, shock the eye by their\r\nenormous size. The boxes to the number of two hundred and twenty-two,\r\nare said to contain thirteen hundred persons; and the pit, including\r\nthe _orchestre_,[1] seven hundred and twenty-four, making in all two\r\nthousand and twenty persons. The construction of this house is\r\nremarkable for iron only being employed in lieu of wood. The\r\narchitect was LOUIS.\r\n\r\nThis theatre, which was begun in 1787, was finished in 1790, when,\r\nall privileges having been done away, it was first opened by a\r\ncompany of French comedians, who played tragedy and comedy. It then\r\ntook the name of _Théâtre Français de la Rue de Richelieu_, which\r\nstreet was afterwards and is now called _Rue de la Loi_. Being opened\r\nat the commencement of the revolution, it naturally adopted its\r\nprinciples; and, when the National Convention had proclaimed the\r\nRepublic, it assumed the pompous name of _Théâtre de la République_.\r\nThe greater part of the actors who performed here, rendered\r\nthemselves remarkable for their _revolutionary_ ardour, and, during\r\nthe reign of terror, it became a privileged theatre.\r\n\r\nThe _Comédie Française_ in the _Faubourg St. Germain_, which, in its\r\ninterior, presented the handsomest playhouse in Paris, was called\r\n_l'Odéon_ a few years ago, and, since then, has been reduced by fire\r\nto a mere shell, the walls only being left standing. In 1789, this\r\ntheatre appeared to follow the torrent of the revolution, and changed\r\nits name for that of _Théâtre de la Nation_. Nevertheless, the actors\r\ndid not, on that account, relinquish the title of _Comédiens\r\nordinaires du Roi_. Shortly after, they even became, in general, the\r\ndeclared partisans of the old _régime_, or at least of the court.\r\nTheir house was frequently an _arena_ where the two parties came to\r\nblows, particularly on the occasion of the tragedy of _Charles Neuf_,\r\nby CHÉNIER, and of the comedy of _L'Ami des Loix_. The former of\r\nthese pieces, represented in the first ebullition of the revolution,\r\nwas directed against the court; and the comedians refused to bring it\r\non the stage, at the time of the assemblage of the national guards in\r\nParis, on the 14th of July, 1790, known by the title of _Federation_.\r\nThe latter was played after the massacres of September 1792, and had\r\nbeen composed with the laudable view of bringing back the public mind\r\nto sentiments of humanity, justice, and moderation. The maxims which\r\nit contained, being diametrically opposite to those of the plunderers\r\nwho then reigned, that is, the members of the _commune_ of Paris, the\r\nminority of the National Convention, the Jacobins, Cordeliers, &c.\r\nthey interrupted the representation, and, after a great uproar, the\r\npiece was prohibited.\r\n\r\nThis minority of which I have just spoken, having succeeded in\r\nsubduing the majority, nothing now stopped the rage of the\r\nrevolutionary party. All those who gave them umbrage were imprisoned,\r\nand put to death with the forms of law. The comedians of the French\r\ntheatre were thrown into prison; it appears that they were, both men\r\nand women, partly destined for the scaffold, and that if they\r\nescaped, it was through the address of a clerk of one of the\r\nCommittees of Public Welfare or of Public Safety, who repeatedly\r\nconcealed the documents containing the charges brought against them.\r\nIt is said that the comedians purpose to prove their gratitude, so\r\nlong delayed, to this young man, without putting themselves to any\r\nexpense, by giving for his benefit an extraordinary\r\nrepresentation.[2]\r\n\r\nAt length the happy 9th of Thermidor arrived; the prisons were thrown\r\nopen; and, as you may well imagine in such a nation as this, the\r\nFrench comedians were not the last to be set at liberty. However,\r\ntheir theatre was not immediately restored to them. It was occupied\r\nby a sort of bastard _spectacle_, with the actors of which they were\r\nthen obliged to form an association. This did not last long. The\r\nFrench comedians were received by the manager of the lyric theatre of\r\nthe _Rue Feydeau_, whom they afterwards ruined. The actors of comedy,\r\nproperly so called, contrived to expel those of tragedy, with whom\r\nthey thought they could dispense; and, shortly, they themselves,\r\nnotwithstanding their reputation, were deserted by the public. The\r\nheroes and heroines, with Mademoiselle RAUCOURT at their head, took\r\npossession of the theatre of the _Rue de Louvois_, and there\r\nprospered. But, after the 18th of Fructidor, (5th of September, 1797)\r\nthe Directory caused this house to be shut up: the reason assigned\r\nwas the representation given here of a little comedy, of ancient date\r\nhowever, and of no great importance, in which a knavish valet is\r\ncalled MERLIN, as was the Minister of Justice of that day, who since\r\nbecame director, not of the theatre, but of the republic.\r\nMademoiselle RAUCOURT, who was directress of this theatre, returned\r\nwith her company to the old theatre of the _Faubourg St. Germain_,\r\nwhich then took the name of _l'Odéon_.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the theatre of the _Rue de Richelieu_ had\r\nperceptibly declined, after the fall of Robespierre, and the public\r\nappeared to have come to a positive determination to frequent it no\r\nlonger. The manager of the _Théâtre Feydeau_, M. SARGENT, formerly a\r\nbanker, who was rich, and enjoyed a good reputation, succeeded in\r\nuniting all the actors of the _Comédie Française_ and those of the\r\n_Théâtre de la République_. This effected his own ruin. When he had\r\nrelinquished the management of the undertaking, the government took\r\nit in hand, and definitively organized this tragic and comic\r\nassociation, to superintend which it appointed a special\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe _repertoire_ (or list of pieces which are here played habitually,\r\nor have been acted with applause) is amazingly well furnished, and\r\ndoes infinite honour to French literature. It may be divided into two\r\nparts, the ancient and the modern. It is the former that deserves the\r\nencomium which I have just bestowed. In the line of Tragedy, it is\r\ncomposed of the greater part of the pieces of the four principal\r\npillars of the temple of the French Melpomene: namely CORNEILLE[3],\r\nRACINE, CRÉBILLON, and VOLTAIRE, to whom may be added DU BELLOY, as\r\nwell as of some detached pieces, such as _Iphigénie en Tauride_ by\r\nGUIMOND DE LA TOUCHE, _Le Comte de Warwick_ and _Philoctète_ by LA\r\nHARPE. The modern _repertoire_, or list of stock-pieces, is formed of\r\nthe tragedies of M. M. DUCIS, CHÉNIER, ARNAULT, LEGOUVÉ, and LE\r\nMERCIER.\r\n\r\nIn the line of Comedy, it is also very rich. You know that, at the\r\nhead of the French comic authors, stands MOLIÈRE, who, in this\r\ncountry at least, has no equal, either among the ancients or the\r\nmoderns. Several of his pieces are still represented, though they are\r\nnot numerously attended; as well because manners are changed, as\r\nbecause the actors are no longer able to perform them. Next to\r\nMOLIÈRE, but at a great interval, comes REGNARD, whom the French\r\ncomedians have deserted, for much the same reason: they no longer\r\ngive any plays from the pen of this author, who possessed the _vis\r\ncomica_, except _Les Folies Amoureuses_, a pretty little comedy in\r\nthree acts. We no longer hear of his _Joueur_ and his _Légataire\r\nUniversel_, which are _chefs d'oeuvre_. There are likewise the works\r\nof DESTOUCHES, who has written _Le Glorieux, Le Dissipateur_, and _La\r\nFausse Agnès_, which are always played with applause. _Le Méchant_,\r\nby GRESSET, is a masterpiece in point of style, and _La Métromanie_,\r\nby PIRON, the best of French comedies, next to those of MOLIÈRE and\r\nREGNARD. Then come the works of LA CHAUSSÉE, who is the father of the\r\n_drame_, and whose pieces are no longer represented, though he has\r\ncomposed several, such as _La Gouvernante_, _L'École des Mères_, _Le\r\nPréjugé à la Mode_, which, notwithstanding, their whining style, are\r\nnot destitute of merit, and those of DANCOURT, who has written\r\nseveral little comedies, of a very lively cast, which are still\r\nplayed, and those of MARIVAUX, whose old metaphysical jargon still\r\npleases such persons as have their head full of love. I might augment\r\nthis list by the name of several other old authors, whose productions\r\nhave more or less merit.\r\n\r\nThe number of modern French comic authors is very limited; for it is\r\nnot even worthwhile to speak of a few little comedies in one act, the\r\ntitle of which the public scarcely remember. According to this\r\ncalculation, there is but one single comic author now living. That is\r\nCOLIN D'HARLEVILLE, who has written _L'Inconstant_, _Les Châteaux en\r\nEspagne_, _Le Vieux Célibataire_, and _Les Moeurs du Jour_, which are\r\nstill represented. _Le Vieux Célibataire_ is always received with\r\nmuch applause. In general, the pieces of M. COLIN are cold, but his\r\nstyle is frequently graceful: he writes in verse; and the whole part\r\nof _L'Inconstant_ is very agreeably written. Indeed, that piece is\r\nthe best of this author.\r\n\r\nFABRE D'EGLANTINE is celebrated as an actor in the revolution (I mean\r\non the political stage), and as the author who has produced the best\r\npiece that has appeared since _La Métromanie_. It is the _Philinte de\r\nMolière_, which, in some measure, forms a sequel to the comedy of the\r\n_Misanthrope_. Nevertheless, this title is ill chosen; for the\r\ncharacter of the _Philinte_ in the piece of MOLIÈRE, and that of\r\nFABRE'S piece scarcely bear any resemblance. We might rather call it\r\nthe _Égoiste_. Although the comic part of it is weak, the piece is\r\nstrongly conceived, the fable very well managed, the style nervous\r\nbut harsh, and the third act is a _chef-d'oeuvre_.\r\n\r\nSince the death of FABRE, another piece of his has been acted,\r\nentitled _Le Précepteur_. In this piece are to be recognized both his\r\nmanner and his affected philosophical opinions. His object is to\r\nvaunt the excellence of the education recommended by J. J. ROUSSEAU,\r\nthough the revolution has, in a great measure, proved the fallacy of\r\nthe principles which it inculcates. As these, however, are presented\r\nwith art, the piece had some success, and still maintains its ground\r\non the stage. It was played for the first time about two years ago.\r\nThe surname of EGLANTINE, which FABRE assumed, arose from his having\r\nwon the prize at the Floral games at Toulouse. The prize consisted of\r\nan _eglantine_ or wild rose in gold. Before he became a dramatic\r\nauthor, he was an actor and a very bad actor. Being nominated member\r\nof the National Convention, he distinguished himself in that\r\nassembly, not by oratorical talents, but by a great deal of villainy.\r\nHe did not think as he acted or spoke. When the _montagnards_[4] or\r\nmountaineers, that is, those monsters who were always thirsting for\r\nblood, divided, he appeared for some time to belong to the party of\r\nDANTON, who, however, denied him when they were both in presence of\r\neach other at the bar of the revolutionary tribunal. DANTON insisted\r\nthat he who had been brought to trial for a just cause, if not a just\r\nmotive, ought not to be confounded with stealers of port-folios.[5]\r\nThey were both sentenced to die, and accordingly executed.\r\n\r\nAmong the comic authors of our age, some people would reckon\r\nDUMOUSTIER, whose person was held in esteem, but whose works are\r\nbelow mediocrity. They are _Le Conciliateur_, a comedy in five acts,\r\nand _Les Femmes_, a comedy in three acts. The latter appears to be\r\nthe picture of a brothel. They are both still played, and both have\r\nmuch vogue, which announces the total decline of the art.\r\n\r\nThere is a third species of dramatic composition, proscribed by the\r\nrules of good taste, and which is neither tragedy nor comedy, but\r\nparticipates of both. It is here termed _drame_. Although LA CHAUSSÉE\r\nis the father of this tragi-comic species of writing, he had not,\r\nhowever, written any _tragédies bourgeoises_, and the French declare\r\nthat we have communicated to them this contagion; for their first\r\n_drame_, _Beverley, ou le Joueur Anglais_ is a translation in verse\r\nfrom the piece of that name of our theatre. The celebrated LEKAIN[6]\r\nopposed its being acted, and affirmed with reason that this mixture\r\nof the two species of drama hurt them both. MOLÉ, who was fond of\r\napplause easily obtained, was the protector of the piece, and played\r\nthe part of _Beverley_ with success; but this _drame_ is no longer\r\nperformed on the Parisian stage. Next to this, comes _Le Père de\r\nFamille_, by DIDEROT. It is a long sermon. However, it presents\r\ncharacters well drawn. This species of composition is so easy that\r\nthe number of _drames_ is considerable; but scarcely any of them are\r\nnow performed, except _Eugénie_ and _La Mère Coupable_, by\r\nBEAUMARCHAIS,[7] which are frequently represented. I shall not finish\r\nthis article without reminding you that MERCIER has written so many\r\n_drames_ that he has been called _Le Dramaturge_. All his are become\r\nthe prey of the little theatres and the aliment of the provincial\r\ndepartments. This circumstance alone would suffice to prove the\r\nmediocrity of the _drame_. MONVEL, of whom I shall soon have occasion\r\nto speak, would well deserve the same title.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is a place, so called in French theatres,\r\ncomprising four or five rows of benches, parted off, between the\r\nplace where the musicians are seated and the front of the pit.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is not mentioned whether these sons and daughters of\r\nThespis, who have since gained a great deal of money, have offered\r\nany _private_ remuneration to their benefactor, rather to their\r\nguardian-angel.] [TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: The scan of this footnote was\r\nimperfect.

PRIX, and NAUDET.\r\n\r\nVANHOVE. This king of the _Théâtre Français_ neither has majesty nor\r\nnobleness of manner. His countenance is mean, and his make common.\r\nHis monotonous and heavy utterance is sometimes intermingled with\r\nyelping sounds. He possesses no sensibility, and substitutes noise\r\nfor expression. His mediocrity caused him to be received at the old\r\n_Comédie Française_; for the first or principal actors of that\r\ntheatre were rather fond of receiving persons of weak talents, merely\r\nthat they might be set off. He _doubled_ BRIZARD, whom nature had\r\nendowed with the happiest gifts for tragedy.\r\n\r\nVANHOVE was the first player ever called for by a Parisian audience\r\nafter the representation, in order to express to him their\r\nsatisfaction. However, it may be proper to observe that, in such\r\ncases, it is always some friend of the author who takes the lead.\r\nVANHOVE no longer obtains this favour at present, and is seldom\r\napplauded. He also plays the parts of fathers in comedy.\r\n\r\nMONVEL. This actor is not near so old as VANHOVE; but the decay of\r\nhis person is such that, when he plays, he seems a skeleton\r\nbestirring itself, or that is set in motion. It is a misfortune for\r\nhim that his physical means betray his talents. MONVEL is a man of\r\ngenius. Thus gifted, it is not astonishing that he has a just\r\ndiction, and is not deficient in intelligence. Some persons doubt\r\nwhether he has real sensibility; but he at least presents the\r\nappearance of it. He, in some measure, breaks his voice, and vents\r\nmournful accents which produce much effect. With a constitution\r\nextremely weak, it is impossible that he should perform characters\r\nwhich require energy and pride. He therefore confines himself to\r\nthose in which the pathetic is predominant, or which do not\r\nimperiously demand great efforts, such as _Auguste_ in _Cinna_,\r\n_Burrhus_ in _Britannicus_, _Brutus_ in the tragedy of that name (now\r\nno longer played), _Lusignan_ in _Zaire_, _Zopire_ in _Mahomet_,\r\n_Fénélon_[1] and _l'Abbé de l'Epée_ in the two pieces of that name.\r\nHis stock of characters then is by no means extensive. We may also\r\nadd to it the part of _Ésope à la cour_, in the comedy of that name\r\nby BOURSAULT, which he plays or recites in great perfection, because\r\nit is composed of fables only. MONVEL delivers them with neatness and\r\nsimplicity. For this part he has no equal in France.[2]\r\n\r\nMONVEL is author as well as actor. He has composed several comic\r\noperas and _drames_; and his pieces, without being good, have always\r\nobtained great applause. His _drames_ are _l'Amant Bourru_,\r\n_Clémentine et Désormes_, _Les Amours de Bayard_, _Les Victimes\r\nCloitrées_, &c. You will find in them forced situations, but set off\r\nby sentiment. He is lavish of stage-effect and that always pleases\r\nthe multitude. _L'Amant Bourru_ has alone remained as a stock-piece.\r\n\r\nBy his zeal for the revolution, he alienated from him a great part of\r\nthe public. When every principle of religion was trodden under foot,\r\nand, under the name of festivals of reason or of the goddess of\r\nreason, orgies of the most scandalous nature were celebrated in the\r\nchurches, MONVEL ascended the pulpit of the parish of St. Roch, and\r\npreached _atheism_ before an immense congregation. Shortly after,\r\nRobespierre caused the National Convention to proclaim the following\r\ndeclaration: \"_The French people acknowledge the Supreme Being and\r\nthe immortality of the soul.\" MONVEL trembled; and it is probable\r\nthat, had not that sanguinary tyrant been overthrown, the atheistical\r\npreacher would have descended from the pulpit only to ascend the\r\nscaffold.[3]\r\n\r\nST. PRIX. He has no fixed employment. Sometimes he plays the parts of\r\nkings, sometimes those of lovers; but excels in none. He would be a\r\nvery handsome man, were it possible to be so with a face void of\r\nexpression. Nature has given him a strong but hollow voice; and he\r\nrecites so coldly, that he makes the public yawn, and seems sometimes\r\nto yawn himself. When he means to display warmth, he screams and\r\nfatigues the ear without mercy.\r\n\r\nNAUDET. This man, who is great only in stature, quitted the rank of\r\nserjeant in the _Gardes Françaises_ to become a bad player. In the\r\ncharacter of kings, he scarcely now appears but to personate tyrants.\r\nHe is very cold, and speaks through his nose like a Capuchin friar,\r\nwhich has gained him the appellation of the Reverend Father NAUDET.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First parts or principal lovers, in Tragedy_.\r\n\r\nTALMA, and LAFOND.\r\n\r\nTALMA. The great reputation which circumstances and his friends[4]\r\nhave given to this actor has, probably, rendered him celebrated in\r\nEngland. His stature and his voice (which, in theatrical language, is\r\ncalled _organ_), should seem to qualify him for the parts of _jeunes\r\npremiers_ only, of which I shall say more hereafter. Accordingly he\r\nmade his _début_ in that line about fifteen or sixteen years ago.\r\nWithout being brilliant, his first appearances were successful, and\r\nhe was received on trial. He soon caused himself to be remarked by\r\nthe correctness of his dress.[5] But what fixed attention on TALMA,\r\nwas the part of _Charles Neuf_, which he plays in the tragedy of that\r\nname.[6] In the riots to which this piece gave rise in 1790, TALMA\r\nfigured as a patriot. Having fallen out with the comedians who had\r\nbehaved ill to him, and no longer placed him in any other parts than\r\nthose of confidants, he was engaged at the new _Théâtre Français_ of\r\nthe _Rue de Richelieu_, where it was proposed to him to perform the\r\ncharacters which pleased him best, that is, the best in each piece.\r\nThus he was seen alternately personating young princes, heroes, and\r\ntyrants.\r\n\r\nTALMA is now reduced to those of the old stock. The characters he at\r\npresent represents are _Cinna_ in the tragedy of that name by\r\nCORNEILLE, _Oreste_ in the _Andromaque_ of RACINE, _Néron_ in the\r\n_Britannicus_ of the same, _OEdipe_ in the tragedy of that name by\r\nVOLTAIRE, and _Faïel_ in _Gabrielle du Vergy_ by DU BELLOY, _Oreste_\r\nin _Iphigénie en Tauride_ by GUIMOND DE LA TOUCHE, and _Ægisthe_ in\r\nthe _Agamemnon_ of LE MERCIER. TALMA also plays many other parts,\r\nbut, in these, he makes no great figure. He had a great aversion to\r\nold pieces, and as long as he preserved his sway at the theatre, very\r\nfew, if any were performed. In fact, there are many in which he is\r\nbelow mediocrity.\r\n\r\nYou will certainly expect that I should tell you what constitutes the\r\ntalent of this performer. He is small in stature, thin in person, and\r\nrather ill-made; his arms and legs being bowed, which he takes care\r\nto conceal by the fulness of his garments. He has a fine eye, and his\r\nfeatures are regular, but too delicate for the perspective of the\r\ntheatre. He has long since adopted the antique head-dress,[7] and has\r\ncontributed to bring it into fashion. He distinguished himself\r\nformerly in Paris by wearing clothes of a strange form. As an actor,\r\nhe has no nobleness of manner, and not unfrequently his gestures are\r\naukward. His deportment is always ungraceful, though he often\r\nendeavours to imitate the posture of the antique statues; but even\r\nthen he presents only a caricature. His countenance has little or no\r\nexpression, except in moments of rage or terror. In pourtraying the\r\nlatter sentiment, all the faculties of his soul appear absorbed; yet,\r\nthough his distraction seems complete, there is a sort of silliness\r\nblended with his stupor, which certain persons take for truth, and\r\nwhich is much more perceptible in the rest of his characters. In\r\nrage, he is a tiger mangling his prey, and sometimes you might\r\nbelieve that you heard that animal drawing his breath. TALMA has\r\nnever expressed well a tender, generous, or noble sentiment. His soul\r\nis neither to be softened nor elevated; and, to produce effect, he\r\nmust be in a terror or in a rage; but then he makes a great\r\nimpression on the majority of the public. His utterance is slow,\r\nminced, and split into syllables. His voice is hollow; but, in\r\nmoments of rage, it is strong, yet without being of a considerable\r\nvolume. He is generally reproached with being deficient in\r\nsensibility: I think, however, that, by dint of labour, he might\r\npaint feeling; for I have heard him render delicate passages happily\r\nenough. He is accused here of having adopted the English style of\r\nacting, though, as far as my opinion goes, with little or no\r\nfoundation. Be this as it may, he passed the early part of his youth\r\nin London, where his father resides, and follows the profession of a\r\ndentist. The son may now be about thirty-eight years of age.\r\n\r\nTALMA preserves the reputation of being a zealous partisan of the\r\nrevolution; but I am confidently assured that he never injured any\r\none, and held in horror the assassinations which have left an\r\nindelible stain on that event. He was intimately connected with the\r\ndeputies, styled _Girondists_ or _Brisotins_, who perished on the\r\nscaffold, after their party was overcome, on the 31st of May, 1793,\r\nby that of the ferocious mountaineers. The latter warmly reproached\r\nTALMA with having, in the year 1792, after the retreat of the\r\nPrussians, given a _fête_ or grand supper to the famous DUMOURIEZ,\r\nwith whom they were beginning to fall out, and whom they accused of\r\ntreason for not having taken the king of Prussia prisoner. The\r\nhideous MARAT, I am told, went to call on that general at TALMA'S,\r\nwhere the company received him very cavalierly, and when he was gone,\r\nDUGAZON the actor, hot-headed revolutionist as he was, by way of\r\npleasantry, pretended to purify the room by burning sugar in a\r\nchaffing-dish. All this amounted to more than was necessary for being\r\ncondemned by the revolutionary tribunal; and TALMA, being detested by\r\nROBESPIERRE, would, in all probability, have been delivered over to\r\nthat tribunal, but for the protection of DAVID, the celebrated\r\npainter, who was concerting with him about changing the form of dress\r\nof the French people. During all the reign of terror, TALMA and his\r\nwife were in continual fear of the scaffold.\r\n\r\nLAFOND. TALMA reigned, and was in possession of the first cast of\r\nparts. Of these, he played whatever suited him, and rejected what he\r\ndisliked, when about a year ago, there appeared in the same line a\r\nyoung actor of a rather tall and well-proportioned stature, and whom\r\nNature had, besides, gifted with an agreeable countenance and a\r\ntolerably good voice. He had played in the provincial theatres; but,\r\nin order to overcome every obstacle which might be opposed to his\r\n_début_, he became a pupil of DUGAZON, an actor of comedy, and what\r\nis more singular, of one more frequently a buffoon than a comedian.\r\nThe latter, however, is said to possess a knowledge of the style of\r\nplaying of the actors who, thirty years ago, graced the French stage,\r\nand consequently may be capable of giving good advice.\r\n\r\nBy means of this powerful protection, LAFOND got the better of every\r\ndifficulty. This actor made his first appearance in the character of\r\n_Achille_ in the tragedy of _Iphigénie en Aulide_ by RACINE. He was\r\nnot the Achilles of Homer, nor even that of the piece, or at best he\r\nrepresented him in miniature. However, his diction generally just,\r\nhis acting, some grace, and, above all, the fatigue and _ennui_ which\r\nTALMA impressed on many of the spectators, procured this rival a\r\ndecisive success. As is customary in such cases, the newspapers were\r\ndivided in opinion. The majority declared for LAFOND, and none of the\r\nopposite side spoke unfavourably of him. It was not so with TALMA.\r\nSome judged him harshly, calling him a detestable actor, while others\r\nbestowed on him the epithet of _sublime_, which, at the present day,\r\nhas scarcely any signification; so much is it lavished on the most\r\nindifferent performers. This instance proves the fact; for if TALMA\r\nhas reached the _sublime_, it is _le sublime de la Halle_.\r\n\r\nThese two rivals might live in peace; the parts which suit the one,\r\nbeing absolutely unfit for the talents of the other. TALMA requires\r\nonly concentered rage, sentiments of hatred and vengeance, which\r\ncertainly belong to tragedy, but which ought not to be expressed as\r\nif they came from the mouth of a low fellow, unworthy of figuring in\r\nan action of this kind; and LAFOND is little qualified for any other\r\nthan graceful parts, bordering on knight-errantry or romance. His\r\nbest character is _Achille_. I have also seen him perform, if not in\r\na manner truly tragic, at least highly satisfactory, _Rodrigue_ in\r\n_Le Cid_ of CORNEILLE, and the part of _Tancrède_ in VOLTAIRE'S\r\ntragedy of that name. LAFOND obtains the preference over TALMA in the\r\ncharacter of _Orosmane_ in the tragedy of _Zaïre_; a character which\r\nis the touchstone of an actor. Not that he excels in it. He has not a\r\nmarked countenance, the dignity, the tone of authority, the energy,\r\nand the extreme sensibility which characterize this part. He is not\r\nthe Sultan who commands. He is, if you please, a young _commis_ very\r\namorous, a little jealous, who gets angry, and becomes good-humoured\r\nagain; but at least he is not a ferocious being, as TALMA represents\r\n_Orosmane_, in moments of rage and passion, or an unfeeling one in\r\nthose which require sensibility.\r\n\r\nLAFOND is reproached sometimes with a bombastic and inflated tone.\r\nFeeling that he is deficient in the necessary powers, he swells his\r\nvoice, which is prejudicial to truth, and without truth, there is no\r\ntheatrical illusion. Nature had intended him for the parts of young\r\nlovers, of which I shall presently speak. His features are too\r\ndelicate, his countenance not sufficiently flexible, and his person\r\nbespeaks too little of the hero, for great characters. But when he\r\nfirst appeared, there was a vacancy in this cast of parts, and none\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeunes Premiers, _or parts of young Lovers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. FAL, DAMAS, and DUPONT.\r\n\r\nST. FAL. This performer, who is upwards of forty-five, has never had\r\nan exterior sufficiently striking to turn the brain of young\r\nprincesses. Every thing in his person is common, and his acting is\r\nreally grotesque. However, not long since he frequently obtained\r\napplause by a great affectation of sensibility and a stage-trick,\r\nwhich consists in uttering loud, harsh, and hoarse sounds after\r\nothers faint and scarcely articulated. He has, besides, but a trivial\r\nor burlesque delivery, and no dignity, no grace in his deportment or\r\ngestures.\r\n\r\nDAMAS. He is much younger than ST. FAL, but his gait and carriage are\r\nvulgar. He is not deficient in warmth; but all this is spoiled by a\r\nmanner the most common. He first played at the theatres on the\r\n_Boulevard_, and will never be able to forget the lessons he imbibed\r\nin that school. It is with him as with the rabbits of which BOILEAU\r\nmakes mention, in one of his Satires where he describes a bad dinner,\r\n\r\n  \"-------- et qui, nés dans Paris,\r\n  Sentaient encore le chou dont ils furent nourris.\"\r\n\r\nThe _drame_ is the style in which DAMAS best succeeds. There is one\r\nin particular, _Le Lovelace Français_, where he personates an\r\nupholsterer of the _Rue St. Antoine_, who has just been cornuted by\r\nthe young Duke of Richelieu. This part he performs with much truth,\r\nand _avec rondeur_, as the critics here express it, to signify\r\nplain-dealing. But DAMAS is no less ignoble in comedy than in\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nDUPONT. This young actor, who is of a very delicate constitution, has\r\nnever had what we call great powers on the stage; and a complaint in\r\nhis tongue has occasioned a great difficulty in his articulation.\r\nWithout having a noble air, he has something distinguishing in his\r\nmanner. His delivery is correct; but the defect of which I have\r\nspoken has rendered him disagreeable to the public, who manifest it\r\nto him rather rudely, though he has sometimes snatched from them\r\ngreat applause.\r\n\r\nAfter all the actors I have mentioned, come the confidants, a dull\r\nand stupid set, of whom one only deserves mention, not as an actor,\r\nbut as an author. This is DUVAL. He has written that pretty comic\r\nopera, entitled _Le Prisonnier_, as well as _Maison à vendre_, and\r\nseveral _drames_, among which we must not forget _Le Lovelace\r\nFrançais, ou la Jeunesse du Duc de Richelieu_, the piece\r\nbefore-mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 20, in continuation_.\r\n\r\nNext follow the daughters of Melpomene, or those heroines who make\r\nthe most conspicuous figure in Tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characters of Queens_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesdames RAUCOURT and VESTRIS.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle RAUCOURT. Never did _début_ make more noise than that of\r\nthis actress, who appeared for the first time on the French stage\r\nabout thirty years ago, and might then be sixteen or seventeen years\r\nof age. She was a pupil of Mademoiselle CLAIRON, who had a numerous\r\nparty, composed of Encyclopædists, French academicians, and almost\r\nall the literati of Paris. The zeal of her friends, the youth, tall\r\nstature, and person of the _débutante_ supplied the place of talent;\r\nand her instructress has recorded in her memoirs that all her labour\r\nwas lost. The success, however, of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT was such,\r\nthat there were, it is said, several persons squeezed to death at the\r\ndoor of the playhouse. What increased enthusiasm in favour of the\r\nyoung actress was, that a reputation for virtue was granted to her as\r\ngreat and as justly merited as that for talent. Her father declared\r\nin the public lobby that he would blow out her brains if he suspected\r\nher of having the smallest intrigue. He kept not his word. Besides,\r\nit is well known that his daughter always took care to conduct\r\nherself in such a manner as to set the foresight even of jealousy at\r\ndefiance. Her _penchant_ not leaving her the resource to which women\r\nof her profession generally recur, and her expenses being\r\nconsiderable, her debts increased; and to avoid the pursuit of her\r\ncreditors she took refuge in Germany with her tender friend,\r\nMademoiselle SOUK, who has since been mistress to the late king of\r\nPrussia. They both travelled over that country, and a thousand\r\nreports are circulated to their shame; but the most disgraceful of\r\nthese are said to be unfounded. The protection of the queen of\r\nFrance, who paid her debts repeatedly, at length restored her to the\r\n_Comédie Française_. Such inconsiderate conduct did no small injury\r\nto that unfortunate princess, whom I mention with concern on such an\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe stature of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT is colossal, and when she\r\npresents herself, she has a very imposing look. Her face, however, is\r\nnot so noble; she has small eyes, and her features have not that\r\nflexibility necessary for expressing the movements of the passions.\r\nHer voice was formerly very full in the _medium_ of level-speaking;\r\nbut it seemed like that of a man. When you heard it for the first\r\ntime, you thought that, in impassioned sentences, she was going to\r\nthunder; but, on the contrary, she assumed a very extensive\r\n_falsetto_, which formed the most singular contrast with the dull\r\nsounds that had preceded it. That defect, perhaps, is somewhat less\r\nstriking at the present day; but the voice of this actress is become\r\nhoarse, like that of persons who make a frequent use of strong\r\nliquors. The delivery of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT is, in general, just\r\nand correct; for she is allowed to have understanding; yet, as she\r\nneither has warmth nor sensibility, she produces scarcely any effect.\r\nPlaudits most frequently burst forth when she appears; but, though\r\nthese are obtained, she never touches the feelings of the spectator,\r\nshe never reaches his heart, even in the parts, where she has had the\r\nmost vogue. That of _Médée_, in which she has begun to reestablish\r\nher declining reputation, was neither better felt nor better\r\nexpressed. She was indebted for the success she obtained in it only\r\nto the magician's robe, to the wand, and to a stage-trick which\r\nconsists in stooping and then raising herself to the utmost height at\r\nthe moment when she apostrophizes the sun. In the scene of Medea with\r\nher children, a heart-rending and terrible scene, there was nothing\r\nbut dryness and a total absence of every maternal feeling.\r\n\r\nThe characters of queens, which Mademoiselle RAUCOURT performs, are\r\nthe first cast of parts at the theatre. It consists of those of\r\nmothers and a few parts of enraged or impassioned lovers. In the\r\nworks of CORNEILLE, the principal ones are _Cléopatre_ in _Rodogune_,\r\nand _Cornélie_ in the _Mort de Pompée_. In RACINE'S, the parts of\r\n_Athalie_ and of _Phèdre_ in the tragedies of the same name, of\r\n_Agrippine_ in _Britannicus_, of _Clitemnestre_ in _Iphigénie en\r\nAulide_, and of _Roxane_ in _Bajazet_. In VOLTAIRE'S, those of\r\n_Mérope_ and _Sémiramis_; and, lastly, that of _Médée_ in the tragedy\r\nby LONGEPIERRE.\r\n\r\nLike all the performers belonging to the _Théâtre Français_,\r\nMademoiselle RAUCOURT was imprisoned during the reign of terror. The\r\npatriots of that day bore her much ill-will, and it is asserted that\r\nRobespierre had a strong desire to send her to the guillotine. When\r\nshe reappeared on the stage, the public compensated her sufferings,\r\nand to this circumstance she owes the rather equivocal reputation she\r\nhas since enjoyed.\r\n\r\nMadame VESTRIS. Although she has been a very long time on the\r\nParisian stage, this actress is celebrated only from the famous\r\nquarrel she had twenty years ago with Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder.\r\nThrough the powerful protection of the Marshal de DURAS,[8] her\r\nlover, she prevailed over her formidable rival, who, however, had on\r\nher side the public, and the sublimity of her talent. This quarrel\r\narose from Madame VESTRIS wishing to wrest from Mademoiselle SAINVAL\r\nthe parts for which she was engaged. A memoir, written by an\r\nindiscreet friend, in favour of the latter, which she scorned to\r\ndisavow, and in which the court was not spared, caused her to be\r\nbanished from the capital by a _lettre de cachet_. The public,\r\ninformed of her exile, called loudly for Mademoiselle SAINVAL. No\r\nattention was paid to this by the higher powers, and the guard at the\r\ntheatre was tripled, in order to insure to Madame VESTRIS the\r\npossibility of performing her part. Nevertheless, whenever she made\r\nher appearance, the public lavished on her hisses, groans, and\r\nimprecations. All this she braved with an effrontery, which\r\noccasioned them to be redoubled. But, as all commotions subside in\r\ntime, Madame VESTRIS remained mistress of the stage; while\r\nMademoiselle SAINVAL travelled over the provinces, where the\r\ninjustice of the court towards her caused no less regret than the\r\nsuperiority of her talent excited admiration.\r\n\r\nMadame VESTRIS was rather handsome, and this explains the whole\r\nmystery. She had, above all, a most beautiful arm, and paid no small\r\nattention to her toilet. She delivers her parts with tolerable\r\ncorrectness, but her tone is heavy and common. The little warmth with\r\nwhich she animates her characters, is the production of an effort;\r\nfor she neither possesses energy nor feeling. Her gestures correspond\r\nwith her acting, and she has no dignity in her deportment. She seldom\r\nappears on the stage at present, which saves her from the\r\nmortification of being hissed. She is now old, and the political\r\nopinion of those who frequent most the theatres rouses them against\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAlthough the court had really committed itself to favour her, Madame\r\nVESTRIS was the first to betray her noble patrons. At the period of\r\nthe revolution, she quitted the old _Comédie Française_, taking with\r\nher DUGAZON, her father, and TALMA, and founded the present theatre,\r\nstyled _Théâtre de la République_. She was also followed by several\r\nauthors; for not being able to conceal from herself the mediocrity of\r\nher talents, especially in such parts of the old plays as had been\r\nperformed by other actresses in a manner far superior, she\r\nfacilitated the representation of new pieces, in which she had not to\r\nfear any humiliating comparison. The principal of these authors were\r\nLA HARPE, DUCIS, and CHÉNIER. The last, who, besides, is famous as\r\nmember of the National Convention and other Legislative Assemblies,\r\ncomposed the tragedy of _Charles Neuf_, in which Madame VESTRIS,\r\nplaying the part of _Catherine de Médicis_, affected, I am told, to\r\nadvance her under-lip, _à l'Autrichienne, in order to occasion\r\ncomparisons injurious to the ill-fated Marie-Antoinette.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characters of Princesses._\r\n\r\nMesdames FLEURY, TALMA, BOURGOIN, and VOLNAIS.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle FLEURY. She has no longer youth nor beauty, and her\r\ntalents as an actress are much on a par with her personal\r\nattractions. She recites with judgment, but almost always with\r\nlanguor, and betrays a want of warmth. Besides, her powers have\r\ndeclined. However, she sometimes displays energetic flashes of a real\r\ntragic truth; but they are borrowed, and it is affirmed, not without\r\nfoundation, that Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder (who is still living)\r\nhas been so obliging as to lend them to her.\r\n\r\nMadame TALMA. For this name she is indebted to a divorce, having\r\nsnatched TALMA from his first wife, an elderly woman who had ruined\r\nherself for him, or whom he had ruined. She quitted her first\r\nhusband, a dancing-master of the name of PETIT, to live under the\r\nmore than friendly protection of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT.----Madame\r\nTALMA is not handsome, and is now on the wane. She plays tragedy,\r\ncomedy, and the _drame_; but has no real talent, except in the\r\nlast-mentioned line. In the first, she wants nobleness and energy.\r\nHer delivery is monotonous. It is said in her praise, that she has\r\n\"_tears in her voice_.\" I believe that it seldom happens to her to\r\nhave any in her eyes, and that this sensibility, for which some would\r\ngive her credit, proceeds not from her heart. In comedy, she wishes\r\nto assume a cavalier and bold manner, brought into vogue by\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT. This manner by no means suits Madame TALMA, who\r\nneither has elegance in her shape, nor animation in her features. In\r\nthe _drame_, her defects disappear, and her good qualities remain.\r\nShe then is really interesting, and her efforts to please are\r\nrewarded by the applause of the public.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle BOURGOIN. With respect to this young lady, a powerful\r\nprotection serves her in lieu of talent; for she is handsome. She\r\npersists in playing tragedy, which is not her fort. In comedy, she\r\nappears to advantage.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle VOLNAIS. This is a very young girl. All she says is in a\r\ncrying tone, and what is worse, she seems not to comprehend what she\r\nsays. In the characters which she first represented she was very\r\nsuccessful, but is no longer so at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characters of Confidantes._\r\n\r\nMesdames SUIN and THÉNARD.\r\n\r\nThere are two only who are deserving of notice. The one is Madame\r\nSUIN, who certainly justifies the character she bears of a woman of\r\njudgment; for she has the most just delivery of all the performers\r\nbelonging to the _Théâtre Français_; but she is advanced in years,\r\nand the public often treat her with rudeness. The other confidante is\r\nMademoiselle THÉNARD, who has played the parts of princesses at this\r\ntheatre with a partial success.\r\n\r\nThere are also other confidantes, whom it is not worth while to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this account of the tragedians belonging to the\r\n_Théâtre Français_, by observing that the revolution is said to have\r\ngiven a new turn to the mind and character of the French women; and\r\nthe success which several actresses, at this day obtain in the\r\ndramatic career, in the line of tragedy, is quoted in support of this\r\nopinion. For a number of years past, as has been seen, Melpomene\r\nseemed to have placed the diadem on the head of Mademoiselle\r\nRAUCOURT, and this tragic queen would probably have grown gray under\r\nthe garments of royalty, had not the revolution imparted to her sex a\r\ndegree of energy sufficient for them to dispute her empire. Women\r\nhere have seen so many instances of cruelty, during the last ten or\r\ntwelve years, they have participated, in a manner more or less\r\ndirect, in an order of things so replete with tragical events, that\r\nthose among them who feel a _penchant_ for the stage, find\r\nthemselves, in consequence, disposed to figure in tragedy.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Fénélon_ is no longer performed. It is a very bad\r\ntragedy by _Chénier_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: There are players members of the National Institute.\r\nMONVEL belongs to the Class of Literature and the Fine Arts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Notwithstanding the ill effects likely to result from\r\nsuch doctrine, far more dangerous to society than the poniards of a\r\nhost of assassins, it appears that, when those actors called\r\nterrorists, or partisans of terror, were hunted down, MONVEL was not\r\nmolested.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: There are a great many enthusiastic admirers of his\r\ntalent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It is really to TALMA that the French are indebted for\r\nthe exact truth of costume which is at this day to be admired on the\r\ntheatres of Paris, especially in new pieces.

The\r\nlatter, dreading his power, but at the same time desirous to\r\nstigmatize him, said: \"'Tis not he who took Minorca, 'tis not he who\r\ntook this place nor that, the man of whom I complain, never took any\r\nthing in his life but my box at the opera!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: All the princes and princesses of the House of Austria\r\nhave the under-lip very prominent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The example of Mesdemoiselles BOURGOIN and VOLNAIS\r\nhaving proved that first-rate talents were not necessary for being\r\nreceived at the _Théâtre Français_, as a tragic queen or princess,\r\nthe number of candidates rapidly increased. For several months past,\r\nthe merit of these _débutantes_ has been the general concern of all\r\nParis. Each had her instructor, and, of course, was carefully tutored\r\nfor the occasion.\r\n\r\nM. LEGOUVÉ, the tragic writer, first brought forward on this stage\r\nMademoiselle DUCHESNOIS, a girl about twenty, extremely ill-favoured\r\nby nature. DUGAZON, the actor, next introduced Madame XAVIER, a very\r\nhandsome and elegant woman. Lastly, Mademoiselle RAUCOURT presented\r\nher pupil, Mademoiselle GEORGES WEIMER, a young girl of perfect\r\nbeauty. Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS played _Phèdre_, in RACINE'S tragedy\r\nof that name, seven successive times. She certainly displayed a\r\nsemblance of sensibility, and, notwithstanding the disadvantages of\r\nher person, produced such an effect on the senses of the debauched\r\nParisian youth by the libidinous manner she adopted in the scene\r\nwhere _Phèdre_ declares her unconquerable passion for her son-in-law\r\n_Hippolyte_, that her success was complete. What greater proof can be\r\nadduced of the vitiated taste of the male part of the audience? She\r\nalso performed _Sémiramis_, _Didon_, and _Hermione_; but in the first\r\ntwo characters she betrayed her deficiency. The next who entered the\r\nlists was Madame XAVIER. On her _début_ in _Sémiramis_, she was\r\nfavourably received by the public; but, afterwards, choosing to act\r\n_Hermione_, the partisans of Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS assembled in\r\nsuch numbers as to constitute a decided majority in the theatre. Not\r\ncontent with interrupting Madame XAVIER, and hissing her off the\r\nstage, they waited for her at the door of the play-house, and loaded\r\nher with the grossest abuse and imprecations. Lastly appeared\r\nMademoiselle GEORGES WEIMER. Warned by the disgraceful conduct of the\r\n_Duchesnistes_ (as they are called) towards Madame XAVIER, the\r\ncomedians, by issuing a great number of _orders_, contrived to\r\nanticipate them, and obtain a majority, especially in the pit.\r\nMademoiselle GEORGES made her _début_ in the character of\r\n_Clitemnestre_, and was well received. Her beauty excited enthusiasm,\r\nand effected a wonderful change in public opinion. After playing\r\nseveral parts in which Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS had either failed, or\r\nwas afraid to appear, she at last ventured to rival her in that of\r\n_Phèdre_. At the first representation of the piece, Mademoiselle\r\nGEORGES obtained only a partial success; but, at the second, she was\r\nmore fortunate. The consequence, however, had well nigh proved truly\r\ntragic. The _Duchesnistes_ and _Georgistes_ had each taken their\r\nposts, the one on the right side of the pit; the other, on the left.\r\nWhen Mademoiselle GEORGES was called for after the performance, and\r\ncame forward, in order to be applauded, the former party hissed her,\r\nwhen the latter falling on them, a general battle ensued. The guard\r\nwas introduced to separate the combatants; but the _Duchesnistes_\r\nwere routed; and, being the aggressors, several of them were\r\nconducted to prison. The First Consul assisted at this\r\nrepresentation; yet his presence had no effect whatever in\r\nrestraining the violence of these dramatic factions.\r\n\r\nSince then, Mesdemoiselles DUCHESNOIS and GEORGES have both been\r\nreceived into the company of the _Théâtre Français_. Madame XAVIER\r\nhas returned to the provinces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 22, 1802._\r\n\r\nThe observation with which I concluded my last letter, might explain\r\nwhy the votaries of Thalia gain so little augmentation to their\r\nnumber; while those of Melpomene are daily increasing. I shall now\r\nproceed to investigate the merits of the former, at the _Théâtre\r\nFrançais_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parts of noble Fathers._\r\n\r\nVANHOVE and NAUDET.\r\n\r\nVANHOVE. This actor is rather more sufferable in comedy than tragedy;\r\nbut in both he is very monotonous, and justifies the lines applied to\r\nhim by a modern satirist, M. DESPAZE:\r\n\r\n  \"VANHOVE, _plus heureux, psalmodie à mon gré;\r\n  Quel succès l'attendait, s'il eût été Curé!_\"\r\n\r\nNAUDET. I have already said that the Reverend Father NAUDET, as he is\r\ncalled, played the parts of tyrants in tragedy. Never did tyrant\r\nappear so inoffensive. As well as VANHOVE, in comedy, he neither\r\nmeets with censure nor applause from the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First parts, or principal lovers, in Comedy._\r\n\r\nMOLÉ, FLEURY, and BAPTISTE the elder.\r\n\r\nMOLÉ. At this name I breathe. Perhaps you have imagined that\r\nill-humour or caprice had till now guided my pen; but, could I praise\r\nthe talent of MOLÉ as he deserves, you would renounce that opinion.\r\n\r\nMOLÉ made his _début_ at the _Comédie Française_ about forty-five\r\nyears ago. He had some success; but as the Parisian public did not\r\nthen become enthusiasts in favour of mere beginners, he was sent into\r\nthe provinces to acquire practice. At the expiration of two or three\r\nyears, he returned, and was received to play the parts of young\r\nlovers in tragedy and comedy. He had not all the nobleness requisite\r\nfor the first-mentioned line of acting; but he had warmth and an\r\nexquisite sensibility. In a word, he maintained his ground by the\r\nside of Mademoiselle DUMESNIL and LEKAIN, two of the greatest\r\ntragedians that ever adorned the French stage. For a long time he was\r\nfamous in the parts of _petits-maîtres_, in which he shone by his\r\nvivacity, levity, and grace.\r\n\r\nThis actor was ambitious in his profession. Although applauded, and\r\nperhaps more so than LEKAIN, he was perfectly sensible that he\r\nproduced not such great, such terrible effects; and he favoured the\r\nintroduction of the _drame_, which is a mixture of tragedy and\r\ncomedy. But those who most detest the whining style of this species\r\nof composition are compelled to acknowledge that MOLÉ was fascinating\r\nin the part of _St. Albin_, in DIDEROT'S _Père de Famille_.\r\n\r\nBELLECOURT being dead, MOLÉ took the first parts in comedy, with the\r\nexception of a few of those in which his predecessor excelled, whose\r\ngreatest merit, I understand, was an air noble and imposing in the\r\nhighest degree. As this was MOLÉ's greatest deficiency, he\r\nendeavoured to make amends for it by some perfection. He had no\r\noccasion to have recourse to art. It was sufficient for him to employ\r\nwell the gifts lavished on him by nature. Though now verging on\r\nseventy, no one expresses love with more eloquence (for sounds too\r\nhave theirs), or with more charm and fire than MOLÉ. In the fourth\r\nact of the _Misanthrope_, he ravishes and subdues the audience, when,\r\nafter having overwhelmed _Célimène_ with reproaches, he paints to her\r\nthe love with which he is inflamed. But this sentiment is not the\r\nonly one in the expression of which MOLÉ is pre-eminently successful.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philinte de Molière_, which also bears the title of _La Suite\r\ndu Misanthrope_, and in which FABRE D'EGLANTINE has presented the\r\ncontrast between an egotist and a man who sacrifices his interest to\r\nthat of his fellow-creatures, MOLÉ vents all the indignation of\r\nvirtue with a warmth, a truth, and even a nobleness which at this day\r\nbelong only to himself. In short, he performs this part, in which the\r\nword _love_ is not once mentioned, with a perfection that he\r\nmaintains from the first line to the last.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth act of _Le Dissipateur_ (a comedy by DESTOUCHES), when\r\nhe sees himself forsaken by his companions of pleasure, and thinks he\r\nis so by his mistress too, the expression of his grief is so natural,\r\nthat you imagine you see the tears trickling from his eyes. In\r\nmoments when he pictures love, his voice, which at times is somewhat\r\nharsh, is softened, lowers its key, and (if I may so express myself)\r\ngoes in search of his heart, in order to draw from it greater\r\nflexibility and feeling. The effect which he produces is irresistible\r\nand universal. Throughout the house the most profound silence is\r\nrigidly, but sympathetically enforced; so great is the apprehension\r\nof losing a single monosyllable in these interesting moments, which\r\nalways appear too short. To this silence succeed shouts of\r\nacclamation and bursts of applause. I never knew any performer\r\ncommand the like but Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder.\r\n\r\nIn no character which MOLÉ performs, does he ever fail to deserve\r\napplause; but there is one, above all, which has infinitely added to\r\nhis reputation. It is that of the _Vieux Célibataire_ in the comedy\r\nof the same name by COLIN D'HARLEVILLE, which he personates with a\r\ngood humoured frankness, an air of indolence and apathy, and at the\r\nsame time a grace that will drive to despair any one who shall\r\nventure to take up this part after him. On seeing him in it, one can\r\nscarcely believe that he is the same man who renders with such warmth\r\nand feeling the part of _Alceste_ in the _Misanthrope_, and in the\r\n_Suite de Molière_; but MOLÉ, imbibing his talent from nature, is\r\ndiversified like her.\r\n\r\nCaressed by the women, associating with the most amiable persons both\r\nof the court and the town, and, in short, idolized by the public,\r\ntill the revolution, no performer led a more agreeable life than\r\nMOLÉ. However, he was not proscribed through it, and this was his\r\nfault. Not having been imprisoned like the other actors of the old\r\n_Comédie Française_, he had no share in their triumph on their\r\nreappearance, and it even required all his talent to maintain his\r\nground; but, as it appears that no serious error could be laid to his\r\ncharge, and as every thing is forgotten in the progress of events, he\r\nresumed part of his ascendency. I shall terminate this article or\r\npanegyric, call it which you please, by observing that whenever MOLÉ\r\nshall retire from the _Théâtre Français_, and his age precludes a\r\ncontrary hope, the best stock-pieces can no longer be acted.[1]\r\n\r\nFLEURY. A man can no more be a comedian in spite of Thalia than a\r\npoet in spite of Minerva. Of this FLEURY affords a proof. This actor\r\nis indebted to the revolution for the reputation he now enjoys; but\r\nwhat is singular, it is not for having shewn himself the friend of\r\nthat great political convulsion. Nature has done little for him. His\r\nappearance is common; his countenance, stern; his voice, hoarse; and\r\nhis delivery, embarrassed; so much so that he speaks only by\r\nsplitting his syllables. A stammering lover! MOLÉ, it is true,\r\nsometimes indulged in a sort of stammer, but it was suited to the\r\nmoment, and not when he had to express the ardour of love. A lover,\r\nsuch as is represented to us in all French comedies, is a being\r\nhighly favoured by Nature, and FLEURY shews him only as much\r\nneglected by her. A great deal of assurance and a habit of the stage,\r\na warmth which proceeds from the head only, and a sort of art to\r\ndisguise his defects, with him supply the place of talent. Although\r\nnaturally very heavy, he strives to appear light and airy in the\r\nparts of _petits-maîtres_, and his great means of success consist in\r\nturning round on his heel. He was calculated for playing _grims_\r\n(which I shall soon explain), and he proves this truth in the little\r\ncomedy of _Les Deux Pages_, taken from the life of the king of\r\nPrussia, the great Frederic, of whose caricature he is the living\r\nmodel. He wished to play capital parts, the parts of MOLÉ, and he\r\ncompletely failed. He ventured to appear in the _Inconstant_, in\r\nwhich MOLÉ is captivating, and it was only to his disgrace. Being\r\ncompelled to relinquish this absurd pretension, he now confines\r\nhimself to new or secondary parts, in the former of which he has to\r\ndread no humiliating comparison, and the latter are not worthy to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nFriends within and without the theatre, and the spirit of party,\r\nhave, however, brought FLEURY into fashion. He will, doubtless,\r\npreserve his vogue; for, in Paris, when a man has once got a name, he\r\nmay dispense with talent:\r\n\r\n   \"_Des réputations; on ne sait pourquoi!\"\r\n\r\nsays GRESSET, the poet, in his comedy of _Le Méchant_, speaking of\r\nthose which are acquired in the capital of France.\r\n\r\nBAPTISTE the elder. But for the revolution, he too would, in all\r\nprobability, never have figured on the _Théâtre Français_. When all\r\nprivileges were abolished, a theatre was opened in the _Rue Culture\r\nSt. Catherine_ in Paris, and BAPTISTE was sent for from Rouen to\r\nperform the first parts. In _Robert Chef des Brigands_ and _La Mère\r\nCoupable_, two _drames_, the one almost as full of improbabilities as\r\nthe other, he had great success; but in _Le Glorieux_ he acquired a\r\nreputation almost as gigantic as his stature, and as brilliant as his\r\ncoat covered with spangles. This was the part in which BELLECOURT\r\nexcelled, and which had been respected even by MOLÉ. The latter at\r\nlength appeared in it; but irony, which is the basis of this\r\ncharacter, was not his talent: yet MOLÉ having seen the court, and\r\nknowing in what manner noblemen conducted themselves, BAPTISTE had an\r\nopportunity of correcting himself by him in the part of _Le\r\nGlorieux_.\r\n\r\nThe _Théâtre Français_ being in want of a performer for such\r\ncharacters, BAPTISTE was called in. Figure to yourself the person of\r\nDon Quixote, and you will have an idea of that of this actor, whose\r\ncountenance, however, is unmeaning, and whose voice seems to issue\r\nfrom the mouth of a speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeunes premiers, _or young lovers, in Comedy_.\r\n\r\nST. FAL, DUPONT, DAMAS, and ARMAND.\r\n\r\nOne might assemble what is best in these four actors, without making\r\none perfect _lover_. I have already spoken of the first three, who,\r\nin comedy, have nearly the same defects as in tragedy. As for the\r\nfourth, he is young; but unfortunately for him, he has no other\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characters of_ Grims, _or_ Rôles à manteau.[2]\r\n\r\nGRANDMÉNIL and CAUMONT.\r\n\r\nGRANDMÉNIL. This performer is, perhaps, the only one who has\r\npreserved what the French critics call _la tradition_, that is, a\r\ntraditionary knowledge of the old school, or of the style in which\r\nplayers formerly acted, and especially in the time of MOLIÈRE. This\r\nwould be an advantage for him, but for a defect which it is not in\r\nhis power to remedy; for what avails justness of diction when a\r\nspeaker can no longer make himself heard? And this is the case with\r\nGRANDMÉNIL. However, I would advise you to see him in the character\r\nof the _Avare_ (in MOLIÈRE'S comedy of that name) which suits him\r\nperfectly. By placing yourself near the stage, you might lose nothing\r\nof the truth and variety of his delivery, as well as of the play of\r\nhis countenance, which is facilitated by his excessive meagreness,\r\nand to which his sharp black eyes give much vivacity.\r\n\r\nGRANDMÉNIL is member of the National Institute.\r\n\r\nCAUMONT. He possesses that in which his principal in this cast of\r\nparts is deficient, and little more. One continually sees the efforts\r\nhe makes to be comic, which sufficiently announces that he is not\r\nnaturally so. However, he has a sort of art, which consists in\r\nstraining his acting a little without overcharging it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parts of Valets_.\r\n\r\nDUGAZON, DAZINCOURT, and LAROCHELLE.\r\n\r\nDUGAZON. One may say much good and much ill of this actor, and yet be\r\nperfectly correct. He has no small share of warmth and comic humour.\r\nHe plays sometimes as if by inspiration; but more frequently too he\r\ncharges his parts immoderately. PRÉVILLE, who is no common authority,\r\nsaid of DUGAZON: \"How well he can play, if he is in the humour!\" He\r\nis but seldom in the humour, and when he is requested not to\r\novercharge his parts, 'tis then that he charges them most. Not that\r\nhe is a spoiled child of the public; for they even treat him\r\nsometimes with severity. True it is that he is reproached for his\r\nconduct during the storms of the revolution. Although advanced in\r\nyears, he became Aide-de-camp to SANTERRE.----SANTERRE! An execrable\r\nname, and almost generally execrated! Is then a mixture of horror and\r\nridicule one of the characteristics of the revolution? And must a\r\npainful remembrance come to interrupt a recital which ought to recall\r\ncheerful ideas only? In his quality of Aide-de-camp to the Commandant\r\nof the national guard of Paris, DUGAZON was directed to superintend\r\nthe interment of the unfortunate Lewis XVI, and in order to consume\r\nin an instant the body of that prince, whose pensioner he had been,\r\nhe caused it to be placed in a bed of quick lime. No doubt, DUGAZON\r\ndid no more than execute the orders he received; but he was to blame\r\nin putting himself in a situation to receive them.\r\n\r\nNot to return too abruptly to the tone which suits an article wherein\r\nI am speaking of actors playing comic parts, I shall relate a\r\ncircumstance which had well nigh become tragic, in regard to DUGAZON,\r\nand which paints the temper of the time when it took place. Being an\r\nauthor as well as an actor, DUGAZON had written a little comedy,\r\nentitled _Le Modéré_. It was his intention to depress the quality\r\nindicated by the title. However, he was thought to have treated his\r\nsubject ill, and, after all, to have made his _modéré_ an honest man.\r\nIn consequence of this opinion, at the very moment when he was coming\r\noff the stage, after having personated that character in his piece,\r\nhe was apprehended and taken to prison.\r\n\r\nDAZINCOURT. In no respect can the same reproaches be addressed to him\r\nas to DUGAZON; but as to what concerns the art, it may be said that\r\nif DUGAZON goes beyond the mark, DAZINCOURT falls short of it.\r\nPRÉVILLE said of the latter as a comedian: \"Leaving pleasantry out of\r\nthe question, DAZINCOURT is well enough.\" Nothing can be added to the\r\nopinion of that great master.\r\n\r\nLAROCHELLE. He has warmth, truth, and much comic humour; but is\r\nsometimes a little inclined to charge his parts. He has a good stage\r\nface. It appears that he can only perform parts not overlong, as his\r\nvoice easily becomes hoarse. This is a misfortune both for himself\r\nand the public; for he really might make a good comedian.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secondary actors in the comic line, such as BAPTISTE\r\nthe younger, who performs in much too silly a manner his parts of\r\nsimpletons, and one DUBLIN, who is the ostensible courier; not to\r\nspeak of some others, whose parts are of little importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 22, in continuation,_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principal female Characters, in Comedy._\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles CONTAT, and MÉZERAY.--Madame TALMA.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT. This actress has really brought about a\r\nrevolution in the theatre. Before her time, the essential requisites\r\nfor the parts which she performs, were sensibility, decorum,\r\nnobleness, and dignity, even in diction, as well as in gestures, and\r\ndeportment. Those qualities are not incompatible with the grace, the\r\nelegance of manners, and the playfulness also required by those\r\ncharacters, the principal object of which is to interest and please,\r\nwhich ought only to touch lightly on comic humour, and not be\r\nassimilated to that of chambermaids, as is done by Mademoiselle\r\nCONTAT. A great coquette, for instance, like _Célimène_ in the\r\n_Misanthrope_, ought not to be represented as a girl of the town, nor\r\n_Madame de Clainville_, in the pretty little comedy of _La Gageure_,\r\nas a shopkeeper's wife.\r\n\r\nThe innovation made by Mademoiselle CONTAT was not passed over\r\nwithout remonstrance. Those strict judges, those conservators of\r\nrules, those arbiters of taste, in short, who had been long in the\r\nhabit of frequenting the theatre, protested loudly against this new\r\nmanner of playing the principal characters. \"That is not becoming!\"\r\nexclaimed they incessantly: which signified \"that is not the truth!\"\r\nBut what could the feeble remonstrances of the old against the warm\r\napplause of the young?\r\n\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT had a charming person, of which you may still be\r\nconvinced. She was not then, as she is now, overloaded with\r\n_embonpoint_, and, though rather inclined to stoop, could avail\r\nherself of the advantages of an elevated stature. None of the\r\nresources of the toilet were neglected by her, and for a long time\r\nthe most elegant women in Paris took the _ton_ for dress from\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT. Besides, she always had a delicacy of\r\ndiscrimination in her delivery, and a varied sprightliness in the\r\n_minutiæ_ of her acting. Her voice, though sometimes rather shrill,\r\nis not deficient in agreeableness, but is easily modulated, except\r\nwhen it is necessary for her to express feeling. The inferiority of\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT on this head is particularly remarkable when she\r\nplays with MOLÉ. In a very indifferent comedy, called _Le Jaloux sans\r\namour_, at the conclusion of which the husband entreats his wife to\r\npardon his faults, MOLÉ contrives to find accents so tender, so\r\naffecting; he envelops his voice, as it were, with sounds so soft, so\r\nmellow, and at the same time so delicate, that the audience, fearing\r\nto lose the most trifling intonation, dare not draw their breath.\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT replies, and, although she has to express the\r\nsame degree of feeling, the charm is broken.\r\n\r\nBeing aware that the want of nobleness and sensibility was a great\r\nobstacle to her success, this actress endeavoured to insure it by\r\nperforming characters which require not those two qualities. The\r\nfirst she selected for her purpose was _Susanne_ in the _Mariage de\r\nFigaro_. _Susanne_ is an elegant and artful chambermaid; and\r\nMademoiselle CONTAT possessed every requisite for representing well\r\nthe part. She had resigned the principal character in the piece to\r\nMademoiselle SAINVAL the younger, an actress who was celebrated in\r\ntragedy, but had never before appeared in comedy. On this occasion, I\r\nsaw Mademoiselle SAINVAL play that ungracious part with a truth, a\r\ngrace, a nobleness, a dignity, a perfection in short, of which no\r\nidea had yet been entertained in Paris.\r\n\r\nAnother part in which Mademoiselle CONTAT also rendered herself\r\nfamous, is that of _Madame Evrard_, in the _Vieux Célibataire_.\r\n--_Madame Evrard_ is an imperious, cunning, and roguish housekeeper;\r\nand this actress has no difficulty in seizing the _ton_ suitable to\r\nsuch a character. This could not be done by one habituated to a more\r\nnoble manner. Mademoiselle CONTAT has not followed the impulse of\r\nNature, who intended her for the characters of _soubrettes_; but,\r\nwhen she made her _début_, there were in that cast of parts three or\r\nfour women not deficient in merit, and it would have taken her a long\r\ntime to make her way through them.\r\n\r\nThe parts which Mademoiselle CONTAT plays at present with the\r\ngreatest success are those in the pieces of MARIVAUX, which all bear\r\na strong resemblance, and the nature of which she alters; for it is\r\nalso one of her defects to change always the character drawn by the\r\nauthor. The reputation enjoyed by this actress is prodigious; and\r\nsuch a _critique_ as the one I am now writing would raise in Paris a\r\ngeneral clamour. Her defects, it is true, are less prominent at this\r\nday, when hereditary rank is annihilated; and merit, more than\r\nmanners, raises men to the highest stations. Besides, it is a\r\npresumption inherent in the Parisians to believe that they never can\r\nbe mistaken. To reason with them on taste is useless; it is\r\nimpossible to compel them to retract when they have once said \"_Cela\r\nest charmant_.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I take leave of Mademoiselle CONTAT, I shall observe that\r\nthere exists in the _Théâtre Français_ a little league, of which she\r\nis the head. Besides herself, it is composed of Mademoiselle\r\nDEVIENNE, DAZINCOURT, and FLEURY. I am confidently assured that the\r\nchoice and reception of pieces, and the _début_ of performers depend\r\nentirely on them. As none of them possess all the requisites for\r\ntheir several casts of parts, they take care to play no other than\r\npieces of an equivocal kind, in which neither _bon ton_, nor _vis\r\ncomica_ is to be found. They avoid, above all, those of MOLIÈRE and\r\nREGNARD, and are extremely fond of the comedies of MARIVAUX, in which\r\nmasters and lackies express themselves and act much alike. The unison\r\nis then perfect, and some people call this _de l'ensemble_, as if any\r\ncould result from such a confusion of parts of an opposite nature. As\r\nfor new pieces, the members of the league must have nothing but\r\n_papillotage_ (as the French call it), interspersed with allusions to\r\ntheir own talent, which the public never fail to applaud. When an\r\nauthor has inserted such compliments in his piece, he is sure of its\r\nbeing received, but not always of its being successful; for when the\r\nground is bad, the tissue is good for nothing.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle MÉZERAY. She is of the school of Mademoiselle CONTAT,\r\nwhence have issued only feeble pupils. But she is very pretty, and\r\nhas the finest eyes imaginable. She plays the parts of young\r\ncoquettes, in which her principal dares no longer appear. Without\r\nbeing vulgar in her manner, one cannot say that she has dignity. As\r\nfor sensibility, she expresses it still less than Mademoiselle\r\nCONTAT. However, the absence of this sentiment is a defect which is\r\nsaid to be now common among the French. Indeed, if it be true that\r\nthey are fickle, and this few will deny, the feeling they possess\r\ncannot be lasting.\r\n\r\nMadame TALMA. I have already spoken of her merits as a comic actress,\r\nwhen I mentioned her as a tragedian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parts of young Lovers._\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles MARS, BOURGOIN, and GROS.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle MARS. She delivers in an ingenuous manner innocent\r\nparts, and those of lovers. She has modest graces, an interesting\r\ncountenance, and appears exceedingly handsome on the stage. But she\r\nwill never be a true actress.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle BOURGOIN. She has some disposition for comedy, which she\r\nneglects, and has none for tragedy, in which she is ambitious to\r\nfigure. I have already alluded to her beauty, which is that of a\r\npretty _grisette_.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle GROS. She is the pupil of DUGAZON, and made her _début_\r\nin tragedy. The newspaper-writers transformed her into Melpomene, yet\r\nso rapid was her decline, that presently she was scarcely more than a\r\nwaiting woman to Thalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacters, _or foolish Mothers_.\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles LACHAISSAIGNE and THÉNARD.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these titles explains the former. In fact, this cast of\r\nparts consists of _characters_, that is, foolish or crabbed old\r\nwomen, antiquated dowagers in love, &c. Commonly, these parts are\r\ntaken up by actresses grown too old for playing _soubrettes_; but to\r\nperform them well, requires no trifling share of comic humour; for,\r\nin general, they are charged with it. At the present day, this\r\ndepartment may be considered as vacant. Mademoiselle LACHAISSAIGNE,\r\nwho is at the head of it, is very old, and never had the requisites\r\nfor performing in it to advantage. Mademoiselle THÉNARD begins to\r\n_double_ her in this line of acting, but in a manner neither more\r\nsprightly nor more captivating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parts of_ Soubrettes _or Chambermaids_.\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles DEVIENNE and DESBROSSES.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle DEVIENNE. If Mademoiselle CONTAT changes the principal\r\ncharacters in comedy into those of chambermaids, Mademoiselle\r\nDEVIENNE does the contrary, and from the same motive, namely, because\r\nshe is deficient in the requisites for her cast of parts, such as\r\nwarmth, comic truth, and vivacity. Yet, while she assumes the airs of\r\na fine lady, she takes care to dwell on the slightest _équivoque_; so\r\nthat what would be no more than gay in the mouth of another woman, in\r\nhers becomes indecent. As she is a mannerist in her acting, some\r\nthink it perfect, and they say too that she is charming. However, she\r\nmust have been very handsome.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle DESBROSSES. The public say nothing of her, and I think\r\nthis is all she can wish for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now passed in review before you those who are charged to\r\ndisplay to advantage the dramatic riches bequeathed to the French\r\nnation by CORNEILLE, RACINE, MOLIÈRE, CRÉBILLON, VOLTAIRE, REGNARD,\r\n&c. &c. &c. If it be impossible to squander them, at least they may\r\nat present be considered as no more than a buried treasure. Although\r\nthe _chefs d'oeuvre_ of those masters of the stage are still\r\nfrequently represented, and the public even appear to see them with\r\ngreater pleasure than new pieces, they no longer communicate that\r\nelectric fire which inflames genius, and (if I may use the\r\nexpression) renders it productive. A great man can, it is true,\r\ncreate every thing himself; but there are minds which require an\r\nimpulse to be set in motion. Without a CORNEILLE, perhaps the French\r\nnation would not have had a RACINE.\r\n\r\nFormerly, people went to the _Théâtre Français_ in order to hear, as\r\nit were, a continual course of eloquence, elocution, and\r\npronunciation. It even had the advantage over the pulpit and the bar,\r\nwhere vivacity of expression was prohibited or restricted. Many a\r\nsacred or profane orator came hither, either privately or publicly,\r\nto study the art by which great actors, at pleasure, worked on the\r\nfeelings of the audience, and charmed their very soul. It was, above\r\nall, at the _Théâtre Français_ that foreigners might have learned to\r\npronounce well the French language. The audience shuddered at the\r\nsmallest fault of pronunciation committed by a performer, and a\r\nthousand voices instantly corrected him. At the present day, the\r\ncomedians insist that it belongs to them alone to form rules on this\r\npoint, and they now and then seem to vie with each other in despising\r\nthose already established. The audience being perhaps too indulgent,\r\nthey stand uncorrected.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the _Théâtre Français_ will recover its former fame,\r\nis a question which Time alone can determine. Undoubtedly, many\r\npersons of a true taste and an experienced ear have disappeared, and\r\nno one now seems inclined to say to the performers: \"That is the\r\npoint which you must attain, and at which you must stop, if you wish\r\nnot to appear deficient, or to overact your part.\" But the fact is,\r\nthey are without a good model, and the spectators, in general, are\r\nstrangers to the _minutiæ/i> of dramatic excellence. In tragedy,\r\nindeed, I am inclined to think that there never existed at the\r\n_Théâtre Français_ such a deficiency of superior talents. When LEKAIN\r\nrose into fame, there were not, I have been told, any male performers\r\nwho went as far as himself, though several possessed separately the\r\nqualifications necessary for that line. However, there was\r\nMademoiselle DUMESNIL, a pupil of nature, from whom he might learn to\r\nexpress all the passions; while from Mademoiselle CLAIRON he might\r\nsnatch all the secrets of art.\r\n\r\nAs for Comedy, it is almost in as desperate a situation. The _ton_ of\r\nsociety and that of comedians may have a reciprocal influence, and\r\nthe revolution having tended to degrade the performance of the\r\nlatter, the consequences may recoil on the former. But here I must\r\nstop.--I shall only add that it is not to the revolution that the\r\ndecline of the art, either in tragedy or comedy, is to be imputed. It\r\nis, I understand, owing to intrigue, which has, for a long time past,\r\nintroduced pitiful performers on the stage of the _Théâtre Français_,\r\nand to a multiplicity of other causes which it would be too tedious\r\nto discuss, or even to mention. Notwithstanding the encomiums daily\r\nlavished on the performers by the venal pen of newspaper writers, the\r\ntruth is well known here on this subject. Endeavours are made by the\r\ngovernment to repair the mischief by forming pupils; but how are they\r\nto be formed without good masters or good models?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It must grieve every admirer of worth and talent to hear\r\nthat MOLÉ is now no more. Not long since he paid the debt of nature.\r\nAs an actor, it is more than probable that \"we ne'er shall look on\r\nhis like again.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The word _Grim_, in French theatrical language, is\r\nprobably derived from _grimace_, and the expression of _Rôles à\r\nmanteau_ arises from the personages which they represent being old\r\nmen, who generally appear on the stage with a cloak.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 24, 1802._\r\n\r\nAmong the customs introduced here since the revolution, that of women\r\nappearing in public in male attire is very prevalent. The more the\r\nPolice endeavours to put a stop to this extravagant whim, the more\r\nsome females seek excuses for persisting in it: the one makes a\r\npretext of business which obliges her to travel frequently, and\r\nthinks she is authorized to wear men's clothes as being more\r\nconvenient on a journey; another, of truly-elegant form, dresses\r\nherself in this manner, because  she wishes to attract more notice by\r\nsingularity, without reflecting that, in laying aside her proper\r\ngarb, she loses those feminine graces, the all-seductive\r\naccompaniments of beauty. Formerly, indeed, nothing could tend more\r\nto disguise the real shape of a woman than the\r\n\r\nCOSTUME OF THE FRENCH LADIES.\r\n\r\nA head-dress, rising upwards of half a yard in height, seemed to\r\nplace her face near the middle of her body; her stomach was\r\ncompressed into a stiff case of whalebone, which checked respiration,\r\nand deprived her almost of the power of eating; while a pair of\r\ncumbersome hoops, placed on her hips, gave to her petticoats the\r\namplitude of a small elliptical, inflated balloon. Under these\r\nstrange accoutrements, it would, at first sight, almost have puzzled\r\nBUFFON himself to decide in what species such a female animal should\r\nbe classed. However, this is no longer an enigma.\r\n\r\nWith the parade of a court, all etiquette of dress disappeared.\r\nDivested of their uncouth and unbecoming habiliments, the women\r\npresently adopted a style of toilet not only more advantageous to the\r\ndisplay of their charms, but also more analogous to modern manners.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was France proclaimed a republic, than the annals of\r\nrepublican antiquity were ransacked for models of female attire: the\r\nRoman tunic and Greek _cothurnus_ soon adorned the shoulders of the\r\nParisian _élégantes_; and every antique statue or picture, relating\r\nto those periods of history, was, in some shape or another, rendered\r\ntributary to the ornament of their person.\r\n\r\nThis revolution in their dress has evidently tended to strengthen\r\ntheir constitution, and give them a pectoral _embonpoint_, very\r\nagreeable, no doubt, to the amateur of female proportion, but the too\r\nopen exposure of which cannot, in a moral point of view, be\r\naltogether approved. These treasures are, in consequence, now as\r\nplentiful as they were before uncommon. You can scarcely move a step\r\nin Paris without seeing something of this kind to exercise your\r\nadmiration. Many of those domains of love, which, under the\r\nold-fashioned dress, would have been considered as a flat country,\r\nnow present, through a transparent crape, the perfect rotundity of\r\ntwo sweetly-rising hillocks. As prisoners, wan and disfigured by\r\nconfinement, recover their health and fulness on being restored to\r\nliberty, so has the bosom of the Parisian belles, released from the\r\nbusk and corset, experienced a salutary expansion.\r\n\r\nIn a political light, this must afford no small satisfaction to him\r\nwho takes an interest in the physical improvement of the human\r\nspecies, as it tends to qualify them better for that maternal office,\r\ndictated by Nature, and which, in this country, has too long and too\r\nfrequently been intrusted to the uncertain discharge  of a mercenary\r\nhireling. Another advantage too arises from the established fashion.\r\nThanks to the ease of their dress, the French ladies can now satisfy\r\nall the capacity of their appetite. Nothing prevents the stomach from\r\nperforming its functions; nothing paralyzes the spring of that\r\nessential organ. Nor, indeed, can they be reproached with\r\nfastidiousness on that score. From the soup to the desert, they are\r\nnot one moment idle: they eat of every thing on the table, and drink\r\nin due proportion. Not that I would by any means insinuate that they\r\ndrink more than is necessary or proper. On the contrary, no women on\r\nearth are more temperate, in this respect, than the French; they, for\r\nthe most part, mix water even with their weakest wine; but they also\r\nswallow two or three glasses of _vin de dessert_, without making an\r\naffected grimace, and what is better, they eat at this rate without\r\nany ill consequence, Now, a good appetite and good digestion must\r\nstrengthen health, and, in general, tend to produce pectoral\r\n_embonpoint_.\r\n\r\nIn this capital, you no longer find among the fair sex those\r\nover-delicate constitutions, whose artificial existence could be\r\nmaintained only by salts, essences, and distilled waters. Charms as\r\nfresh as those of Hebe, beauties which might rival the feminine\r\nsoftness of those of Venus, while they bespeak the vigour of Diana,\r\nand the bloom of Hygëia, are the advantages which distinguish many of\r\nthe Parisian belles of the present day, and for which they are, in a\r\ngreat measure, indebted to the freedom they enjoy under the antique\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nIn no part of the world, perhaps, do women pay a more rigid attention\r\nto cleanliness in their person than in Paris. The frequent use of the\r\ntepid bath, and of every thing tending to preserve the beauty of\r\ntheir fine forms, employ their constant solicitude. So much care is\r\nnot thrown away. No where, I believe, are women now to be seen more\r\nuniformly healthy, no where do they possess more the art of assisting\r\nnature; no where, in a word, are they better skilled in concealing\r\nand repairing the ravages of Time, not so much by the use of\r\ncosmetics, as by the tasteful manner in which they vary the\r\ndecoration of their person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 25, 1802._\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the general effervescence to which the\r\nrevolution gave birth, soon extended to the seminaries of learning.\r\nThe alarm-bell resounded even in the most silent of those retreats.\r\nBands of insurgents, intermixed with women, children, and men of\r\nevery condition, came each moment to interrupt the studies, and,\r\nforcing the students to range themselves under their filthy banner,\r\npresented to them the spectacle of every excess. It required not all\r\nthis violence to disorganize institutions already become\r\nantiquated,[1] and few of which any longer enjoyed much consideration\r\nin the public opinion. The colleges and universities were deserted,\r\nand their exercises ceased. Not long after, they were suppressed. The\r\nonly establishment of this description which has survived the storms\r\nof the revolution, and which is no less important from its utility\r\nthan extensive in its object, is the\r\n\r\nCOLLÈGE DE FRANCE.\r\n\r\nIt neither owed this exemption to its ancient celebrity, nor to the\r\ntalents of its professors; but having no rich collections which could\r\nattract notice, no particular estates which could tempt cupidity, it\r\nwas merely forgotten by the revolutionists, and their ignorance\r\ninsured its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe _Collège de France_ is, at the present day, in this country, and\r\nperhaps in the rest of Europe, the only establishment where every\r\nbranch of human knowledge is taught in its fullest extent. The object\r\nof this institution is to spread the most elevated notions of the\r\nsciences, to maintain and pave the way to the progress of literature,\r\neither by preserving the taste and purity of the ancient authors, or\r\nby exhibiting the order, lustre, and richness of the modern. Its duty\r\nis to be continually at the head of all the establishments of public\r\ninstruction, in order to guide them, lead them on, and, as it were,\r\nlight them with the torch of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis college, which is situated in the _Place de Cambray_, _Rue St.\r\nJacques_, was founded by Francis I. That monarch, distinguished from\r\nall cotemporaries by his genius, amiableness, and magnificence, saw\r\nin literature the source of the glory of princes, and of the\r\ncivilization of the people. He loved and honoured it, not only in the\r\nwritings of the learned, but in the learned themselves, whom he\r\ncalled about his person, at the same time loading them with\r\nencouragement and favours. It is singular that those times, so rude\r\nin many respects, were, nevertheless, productive of sentiments the\r\nmost delicate and noble.\r\n\r\nTruth never shuns princes who welcome it. Francis I was not suffered\r\nto remain ignorant of the deplorable state in which literature then\r\nwas in France, and, though very young, he disdained not this\r\ninformation. Nothing, in fact, could approach nearer to barbarism.\r\nThe impulse Charlemagne had given to study was checked. The torches\r\nhe had lighted were on the point of being extinguished. That famous\r\nuniversity which he had created had fallen into decline. A prey to\r\nall the cavils of pedantry, it substituted dispute and quibble to\r\ntrue philosophy.\r\n\r\nNothing was any longer talked of but the _five universals_,\r\n_substance_, and _accident_. All the fury of argument was manifested\r\nto know whether those were simple figures, or beings really existing,\r\nall things equally useful to the revival of knowledge and the\r\nhappiness of mankind. The Hebrew and Greek tongues were scarcely, if\r\nat all, known; the living languages, little cultivated; Latin itself,\r\nthen almost common, was taught in the most rude and imperfect manner.\r\nIn short, the most learned body of the State had fallen into the most\r\nprofound ignorance: a striking example of the necessity of renewing\r\ncontinually and maintaining the life of those bodies employed in\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nI am not speaking of the sciences, then entirely unknown. The\r\nlanguages were every thing at this period, on account of their\r\nconnexion with religion.\r\n\r\nThe small number of men of merit whom the bad taste of the age had\r\nnot reached, were striving to restore to literature its lustre, and\r\nto men's minds their true direction; but, in order to revive the\r\ntaste for good studies, it was necessary to create a new\r\nestablishment for public instruction, which should be sufficiently\r\nextensive for acquiring a great influence. It was necessary to\r\nassemble men the most celebrated for their talent and reputation, in\r\norder that, being thus placed in full view, and presented to public\r\nattention, they might rectify the minds of men by their authority, as\r\nwell as enlighten them by their knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis undertaking, difficult in itself, became much less so through\r\nthe circumstances which then existed. Taste seemed to have taken\r\nrefuge at the court, and the king easily yielded to the reasons of\r\nthe learned who approached him; but no one took a greater share in\r\nthis project than the celebrated Erasmus. Remote from it as he was,\r\nhe accelerated its execution by the disinterested praises which he\r\nlavished on it. The king sent to invite him, in the most flattering\r\nterms, to take the direction of it and to settle in France; but\r\nErasmus, jealous of liberty, retained besides by the gratitude he\r\nowed to Charles V, and by the care he bestowed on the College of\r\nLouvain which he had founded, refused this task, equally honourable\r\nand useful. He manifested not the less, in his letters, the joy he\r\nfelt to see studies re-established by the only means which could\r\nreanimate them. It is pleasing to the true friends of the sciences to\r\nfind among those who cultivate them similar traits of generosity and\r\nnobleness.\r\n\r\nAt length peace having restored to France repose and the means of\r\nrepairing her losses, the king gave himself up without reserve to the\r\ndesire he had of making the sciences flourish, and realized the grand\r\nproject of public instruction which had for a long time occupied his\r\nmind. The new college took the name of _Collège Royal_. It had\r\nprofessors for the Hebrew and Greek tongues, and some even for the\r\nmathematics, philosophy, medicine, and the living languages.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the _Collège Royal_ gave great displeasure to the\r\nUniversity. After having held so long without a rival the sceptre of\r\nthe sciences and literature, it was grating to its members to\r\nrelinquish it. They could ill bear to see set above it an\r\nestablishment evidently intended to direct and guide it. Self-love\r\noffended seldom forgives, especially when it is animated by the\r\n_esprit de corps_. The University depreciated the new college, and\r\nendeavoured to fetter it in a thousand ways. At last, those dark\r\nintrigues being constantly smothered by the applause which the\r\nprofessors received, the University finished by bringing them before\r\na court of justice. From, envy to persecution there is but one step,\r\nand that step was soon taken.\r\n\r\nReligion served as a pretext and a cloak for this accusation. It was\r\naffirmed that the new professors could not, without danger to the\r\nfaith, explain the Hebrew and Greek tongues, if they had not been\r\npresented to the University to be examined by it, and received from\r\nit their mission. To this it was answered, that if the theologians of\r\nthe University understood Greek and Hebrew, it must be easy for them\r\nto denounce the passages in which the new professors had erred, and\r\nthat if, on the contrary, they did not understand those languages,\r\nthey ought not to pretend to judge those who taught them. After long\r\ndebates, things were left in the state in which they were before the\r\ntrial. Each party continued quietly its lessons, and, as it almost\r\nalways happens in such cases, reason ended by having its due weight:\r\ntrue it is that it was then supported by royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe _Collège de France_ has not since ceased to make an increasing\r\nprogress. It even had the valuable advantage of reforming itself\r\nsuccessively, and of following new ideas, the necessary result of its\r\nconstitution and of the lustre that has always surrounded it; two\r\ncauses which have occasioned its chairs to be sought by the most\r\ncelebrated men of every description. It is this successive reform\r\nwhich constitutes the distinctive character of the _Collège de\r\nFrance_, and which has always enabled it to fulfil its real object.\r\n\r\nThus, to quote but one example. The chair of Greek philosophy was, in\r\nthe beginning, intended to make known the writings of the ancient\r\nphilosophers on the nature of things and the organization of the\r\nuniverse. These were, at that time, the only repositories of human\r\nknowledge for mathematics and physics; but, in proportion as the\r\nsciences, more advanced, substituted rational theories for hazardous\r\nconjectures, the modern discoveries of astronomy were taught,\r\ntogether with the writings of the ancients. The object of this chair,\r\nwhich at the present day bears the name of general physics and\r\nmathematics, is to disseminate the most elevated notions of mechanics\r\nand the theory of the system of the world. The works taught by its\r\noccupier are analytical mechanics and celestial mechanics, that is,\r\nthose works which form the limits of our knowledge for mathematical\r\nanalysis, and consequently those of which it is most important to\r\nincrease the very small number of readers.\r\n\r\nBy a consequence of that spirit of amelioration which animates this\r\nCollege, some time before the revolution, a chair and a cabinet of\r\nexperimental physics were added to it.\r\n\r\nAs for the natural sciences, which are taught here with much depth\r\nand detail in several establishments, they have, in the _Collège de\r\nFrance_, a sort of regulator which directs them, as it were, by their\r\ngeneralities. It is, in fact, to this only that an establishment\r\nwhich, by its nature, contains no collection, ought to attach itself,\r\nand the philosophy of the sciences, the result and completion of\r\ntheir study, here constitutes the object of all the lectures.\r\n\r\nThus the improvements which the sciences have successively\r\nexperienced, have always been spread by the instruction of the\r\n_Collège Royal_; and among the professors who have occupied its\r\nchairs, none can be quoted who have been strangers to their progress.\r\n\r\nThe revolution, which overthrew in France the ancient universities,\r\nsuspended for some time the exercises of this establishment; but,\r\nunder the name of _Collège de France_, it has since resumed a new\r\nlustre. It then found itself compelled to new efforts, in order to\r\nmaintain its place among the scientific institutions, which have\r\nemulously risen in every branch of human knowledge. Nevertheless,\r\nthose different sciences, even natural history, and the curative art,\r\ntaught with so much perfection in private establishments, have hence\r\nderived great advantages, and here it is that public instruction\r\ncomes at once to be resumed, investigated, and extended.\r\n\r\nThe present government appears to be perfectly sensible of the\r\nimportance of such an establishment. The enlightened men, the\r\ncelebrated _savans_, who approach it, have pointed out in the\r\n_Collège de France_ a _normal_ school, completely formed, and which\r\nunites to the extent of its object the ever-powerful ascendant of\r\nseniority. The similarity between the circumstances in which this\r\ninstitution is at the present day and those when it was founded,\r\naffords the most certain hope of its progress being maintained and\r\naccelerated.\r\n\r\nThis is what appears to me the most interesting in the history of\r\nthis ancient college. I say nothing of its present professors; their\r\nzeal is proved by their assiduous and uninterrupted lessons; their\r\nmerit is before the judgment of the public; and as for their names,\r\nthese are indifferent to the results of their labours. If any other\r\nmotive than that of the interest of the sciences were blended with\r\nthe information I now communicate, I should not think that, in this\r\nletter, I was fulfilling the object of your wishes.\r\n\r\nP.S. It may not be useless to mention that no students are attached\r\nto the _Collège de France_. The lectures are public; and every one\r\nwho is desirous of improving his mind in any branch of science, may\r\nattend them free of expense or trouble. It is impossible for the\r\nfriend of learning to withhold his admiration from so noble an\r\ninstitution. What, in fact, can be more liberal than this gratuitous\r\ndiffusion of knowledge?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Whatever sentiment may have been preserved respecting\r\nthe ancient University of Paris, every impartial person must\r\nacknowledge that it was several centuries in arrear in regard to\r\nevery thing which concerns the Arts and Sciences. Peripatetic, when\r\nthe learned had, with Descartes, renounced the philosophy of\r\nAristotle, it became Cartesian, when they were Newtonians. Such is\r\nthe too general custom of bodies, engaged in instruction, who make no\r\ndiscoveries. Invested at their formation with great influence over\r\nscientific opinions, because they are composed of the best informed\r\nmen of the day, they wish constantly to preserve those advantages.\r\nThey with reluctance suffer that there should be formed, elsewhere\r\nthan in their own bosom, new opinions which might balance theirs; and\r\nif the progress of the sciences at last obliges them to abandon their\r\ndoctrine, they never adopt the most modern theories, were they, in\r\nother respects, preferable; but embrace those which existed for some\r\ntime anterior to them, and which they themselves had before combated.\r\nThis inertness of bodies, employed in instruction, is an unavoidable\r\nevil; because it is the effect of self-love, the most invariable of\r\npassions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 17, 1802._\r\n\r\nIf we do not consider the _Opera Buffa_ as a national theatre, then\r\nthe next in rank, after the Grand French Opera and the _Théâtre\r\nFrançais_, is the\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE DE L'OPÉRA COMIQUE.\r\n\r\nThis house, which is situated in the _Rue Feydeau_, near the _Rue de\r\nla Loi_, was opened for the first time in January 1791. The entrance\r\nto it is by a circular vestibule, externally decorated with\r\ncaryatides, and sufficiently spacious for one carriage to enter while\r\nanother drives off by an adjoining outlet. At the end of this\r\nvestibule is a long gallery, bordered by shops on both sides, which\r\nforms a second entrance by the _Rue Filles St. Thomas_.\r\n\r\nThe interior form of this theatre is a semi-circle, extended in a\r\nright line at its extremities, which places the orchestra in a\r\ncentral position, and renders the house one of the fittest in Paris\r\nfor a concert. Two rows of Gothic pillars, one above the other,\r\noccupy nearly all its height; and though it contains eight tiers of\r\nboxes, five only are in sight. The same distribution repeated in\r\nregard to the stage-boxes, presents a very projecting pavilion, which\r\nseems to support a large triumphal arch. However grand this style of\r\narchitecture may be in appearance, in effect it renders the seats\r\nvery inconvenient to two-thirds of the spectators. The ornaments\r\nconsist of a strange mixture of the Greek, Gothic, and Oriental. The\r\nhouse is said to contain two thousand persons.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, this theatre united the performers of the original\r\n_Opéra Buffa_ and some of those belonging to the old French Comic\r\nOpera, who played alternately. The former retiring from Paris in\r\n1792, the latter for some time attracted full houses by the\r\nexcellence of their style of singing, tasteful decorations, and one\r\nof the best composed orchestras in the capital.\r\n\r\nSince then, it has experienced the changes and vicissitudes attendant\r\non the revolution. At present, the company is composed of a selection\r\nfrom the performers of the _Opéra Comique_ of the _Théâtre Favart_\r\n(formerly known by the name of _Théâtre Italien_), and those of the\r\nlyric theatre of which I am now speaking. This junction has not long\r\nbeen effected. Previously to its taking place, the _Comédie\r\nItalienne_, where French comic operas only were represented, was\r\nstill constituted as it was under the old _régime_, of which it was\r\nremarked as being the sole remnant.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the French Comic Opera was very rich in stock-pieces,\r\nchiefly written by FAVART, SÉDAINE, MARMONTEL, HÈLE,[1] MONVEL,\r\nMARSOLIER, HOFFMAN, and others. Their productions were set to music\r\nby GRÉTRY, MONSIGNY, PHILIDOR, DÉSAÏDES, DALEYRAC, &c. These pieces\r\nare now seldom played, the music of them being antiquated; though for\r\nenergy and truth of expression some of it surpasses that of many of\r\nthe more modern compositions. The new authors are little known. The\r\ncomposers of the music are MÉHUL, DALEYRAC before-mentioned,\r\nBOYELDIEU, TARCHI, &c. The modern pieces the most in vogue and most\r\nattractive are _Le Prisonnier_, _l'Opéra Comique_, a piece so called,\r\n_Le Calife de Bagdad_, _Maison à vendre_, _D'Auberge en Auberge_, and\r\na few others of the same description. All these are really pleasing\r\ncomedies.\r\n\r\nThe _Théâtre Feydeau_ itself was also in possession of a great number\r\nof stock-pieces, among which were some in the style of the Grand\r\nFrench Opera. A considerable change seems to have taken place, as the\r\nlatter are now no longer represented.\r\n\r\nIn surveying the _Opéra Comique_, one would imagine that, in lieu of\r\none company, two separate ones had been formed to play in the same\r\ntheatre. The former is the weaker in number, but the stronger in\r\ntalent. The latter, though weaker, has some good performers, in the\r\nlong list of those of whom it is composed; but, in general, they are\r\neither no longer in their pristine lustre, or have not yet attained a\r\ncompetent degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nSeldom are the two companies mixed. Pieces in the style of the modern\r\n_Opéra Comique_, in which easy mirth is replaced by quaint jests, are\r\nplayed exclusively by the former. They draw crowded houses, as the\r\npublic are extremely partial to them. Lyric _drames_ are abandoned to\r\nthe latter, and the old stock-pieces to such of the performers as\r\nchoose to act in them for a small number of spectators who are so\r\nobliging as to enter the house with _orders_ or _free_ admission. OF\r\nall the repositories of old pieces that of the _Comédie Italienne_ is\r\nthe one which is the most entirely neglected. This is rather the\r\nfault of the actors than that of the public. There are many old\r\nproductions which would attract a crowd, were the best performers to\r\nplay them; but who likes to pay for seeing a master-piece murdered?\r\n--We now come to speak of the qualifications of these performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principal Characters and parts of Lovers._\r\n\r\nCounter-Tenors.\r\n\r\nELLEVIOU, GAVAUDAN, PHILIPPE, and GAVEAUX.\r\n\r\nELLEVIOU. He is the first singer at the _Opéra Comique_. Nor will\r\nthis opinion be contradicted by any of the elegant and pretty women\r\nwho, slaves to the custom of shewing themselves at the first\r\nrepresentation of a new piece, never begin to applaud till ELLEVIOU\r\nmakes his appearance.\r\n\r\nThis performer is, in fact, gifted with a handsome person, an easy\r\nmanner, an expressive countenance, and a voice, which, when he\r\nmodulates it, is charming. His delivery is tolerably good, and in\r\nsome parts, he is not deficient in warmth and feeling. As a singer,\r\nELLEVIOU leaves behind all those destined to second him. After having\r\nbegun by singing bass, he has taken the parts of counter-tenor, for\r\nwhich, however, his voice is not suited, but he makes up for this\r\ndeficiency by a very flexible tenor. He displays much art and a very\r\nmodern taste. His method too is good; he makes no improper use of his\r\nfacility by lavishing graces, but his manner is too uniform. This is\r\nthe greatest objection that can be made to him, in the double\r\ncapacity of singer and comedian.\r\n\r\nGAVAUDAN. This young actor, with a well-proportioned stature and a\r\nvery agreeable countenance, ranks, at the _Opéra Comique_, next in\r\nmerit to ELLEVIOU. His voice, as a counter-tenor, is not very\r\nbrilliant, nor his means extensive; but his taste is good, and his\r\nmethod that of the modern school. As a player, he has a certain\r\nrepution in lyric _drames_, and especially in those melancholy parts,\r\nthe characteristic of which is a concentrated passion. He imitates\r\nTALMA, and, like him, \"outsteps the modesty of Nature.\"\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE. His reputation was begun by the advantages of his person,\r\nand he consolidated it by his performance in the line of\r\nknight-errantry. _Richard, coeur de lion_, was the part which\r\nsecured him the public favour. His voice is still an agreeable\r\ncounter-tenor; but he declines through age. As an actor, he is\r\ndeficient in nobleness, and his gestures are not dignified; but,\r\nbeing used to the stage, and possessing some feeling, he often\r\nproduces happy effects.\r\n\r\nGAVEAUX. He has been a good singer in his youth, and is a very\r\nagreeable composer. He always acquits himself of any part he\r\nundertakes, if not in a brilliant manner, at least with credit. Two\r\nof his musical productions are stock-pieces, and well worth seeing.\r\n_L'Amour Filial_ is a happy imitation of the Italian school, and\r\n_Sophie et Moncars_ is always heard with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characters of Fathers, Valets, or Comic Parts_.\r\n\r\nBass-voices.\r\n\r\nCHENARD, MARTIN, RÉZICOURT, JULIET, and MOREAU.\r\n\r\nCHENARD. Owing to an advantageous person, this actor once stood as\r\nhigh in the favour of the ladies as ELLEVIOU does at present. He\r\nstill possesses a fine voice, as a bass, but it is not very flexible.\r\nIn the part of _Monsieur de la France_, in _l'Épreuve Villageoise_,\r\nhe established his fame as a singer; yet his style is not\r\nsufficiently modelled after the modern taste, which is the Italian.\r\nAs an actor, he is very useful; but, having always been treated by\r\nthe public like a spoiled child, he is too apt to introduce his own\r\nsallies into his parts, which he sometimes charges with vulgarisms of\r\nthe lowest description.\r\n\r\nMARTIN. In the parts of valets, MARTIN cannot be better placed than\r\nnear ELLEVIOU, whom he seconds with skill and taste. This has led the\r\ncomposers here to an innovation. Formerly, duets in the graceful\r\nstyle between men were seldom heard; but the voices of ELLEVIOU and\r\nMARTIN being perfectly adapted to each other, almost all the\r\ncomposers have written for them duets in which the _cantabile_\r\nprevails, and concerted cadences are very conspicuous. This, I\r\nunderstand, is unprecedented in Paris.\r\n\r\nMARTIN made his _début_ in 1783 at the _Théâtre de Monsieur_ in the\r\ncompany of Italian buffoons. In this school he acquired that taste\r\nwhich he has since propagated with zeal, if not with success. At the\r\npresent day, he is accused of loading his singing with superfluous\r\nembellishments, or of placing them without judgment in passages or\r\nsituations where they are ill-suited. However, in _morceaux\r\nd'ensemble_ he is quite at home, and, of course, shews himself to\r\ngreat advantage. As an actor, he is by no means remarkable, though he\r\nsometimes displays intelligence.\r\n\r\nRÉZICOURT. He may justly be called a good comedian, without examining\r\nhis merits as a singer.\r\n\r\nJULIET. In the newspapers, this performer is called _inimitable_. His\r\nmanner is his own; yet, perhaps, it would be very dangerous to advise\r\nany one to imitate it. He is not deficient in intelligence, and has\r\nthe habit of the stage; but his first quality is to be extremely\r\nnatural, particularly in the parts of Peasants, which he performs\r\nwith much truth. He seems to be born a player, and though he is not a\r\nmusician, he always sings in tune and in time.\r\n\r\nMOREAU. An agreeable person, open countenance, animation, an\r\ningenuous manner, and an unerring memory. He is very well placed in\r\nyoung Peasants, such as _Le Bon André_ and _Lubin_ of FAVART, as well\r\nas in the parts of Valets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixed characters of every sort_.--Tenors.\r\n\r\nSOLIÉ, and ST. AUBIN.\r\n\r\nSOLIÉ. He first appeared in the parts of young lovers with a tall\r\nstature and a handsome face, but neither of them being fashioned for\r\nsuch characters, he met with no applause. His voice was not very\r\nbrilliant, but his method of singing was replete with grace and\r\ntaste. For this, however, he obtained no credit; the Parisian public\r\nnot being yet accustomed to the modern or Italian style. CLAIRVAL,\r\nthe first singer at the old _Opéra Comique_, happening to be taken\r\nsuddenly ill one night, SOLIÉ undertook his part at a moment's\r\nwarning. Success crowned his temerity, and from that moment his merit\r\nwas appreciated. His best character is _Micheli_ in _Les deux\r\nSavoyards_, in which he established his reputation. In the pieces of\r\nwhich MÉHUL has composed the music, he shines by the finished manner\r\nin which he executes it; the _cantabile_ is his fort. As an actor,\r\nhis declamation is not natural, and his deportment is too much that\r\nof a mannerist. However, these defects are compensated by his\r\nsinging. To the music of others, he does every justice, and that\r\nwhich he composes himself is extremely agreeable.\r\n\r\nST. AUBIN. This performer once had a good voice as a counter-tenor;\r\nbut as he now plays no other than secondary parts, one might imagine\r\nthat he is retained at the theatre only in consideration of his\r\nwife's talents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caricatures and Simpletons_.\r\n\r\nDOZAINVILLE, and LESAGE.\r\n\r\nDOZAINVILLE. The person of this actor is very favourable for\r\ncaricatures and the characters of simpletons, which he fills. The\r\nmeagreness of his countenance renders it very flexible; but not\r\nunfrequently he carries this flexibility to grimace. As a singer, he\r\nmust not be mentioned.\r\n\r\nLESAGE. He is a musician, but has little voice. He performs the parts\r\nof simple peasants in a natural manner, but with too much uniformity.\r\nThis is is a general defect attached to those characters.--Let me\r\nnext introduce the female performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First female Singers and Parts of Lovers_.\r\n\r\nMesdames ST. AUBIN, SCIO, LESAGE, CRÉTU,\r\nPHILIS the elder, GAVAUDAN, and PINGENET.\r\n\r\nMadame ST. AUBIN. She is a capital actress, though chiefly in the\r\nparts of young girls; yet she is the main pillar of the _Opéra\r\nComique_. She never has been handsome, at least when closely viewed,\r\nand is now on the wane, being turned of forty-five; but her graceful\r\nlittle figure and delicate features make her appear pretty on the\r\nstage. Neatness and _naïveté_ characterise her acting. She has\r\nscarcely any voice, but no other songs than romances or ballads are\r\nassigned to her. She formerly played at the Grand French Opera, where\r\nshe was applauded in noble and impassioned parts, though they are\r\nnot, in general, suited to her manner. But an actress, high in favour\r\nwith the public, is always applauded in whatever character she\r\nappears. The pieces in which Madame ST. AUBIN excels are _Le\r\nPrisonnier, Adolphe et Clara_, and _L'Opéra Comique_, which is the\r\ntitle of a piece, as I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nMadame SCIO. Although she is said not to be well versed in music, she\r\nhas a very extensive and powerful voice, but its tones have little\r\nvariety. As an actress, she is very indifferent. Without being mean,\r\nshe has no nobleness of manner. Like almost all the performers\r\nbelonging to the _Opéra Comique_, she delivers ill the dialogue, or\r\nsuch sentences as are not set to music. As she frequently strains her\r\nacting, persons deficient in taste are pleased to bestow on her the\r\nepithet of _great_ as an actress. However, she played _Médée_ in a\r\nlyric tragedy of that name; but such a Medea was never seen! As a\r\nsinger, Madame Scio is a valuable acquisition to this theatre. In\r\npoint of person, she is neither ordinary nor handsome.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle LESAGE. Her singing is chaste, but destitute of that\r\nmusical energy which distinguishes great singers. She plays _les\r\ningénuités_ or innocent characters; but is rather a mannerist,\r\ninstead of being childish. She then employs a false voice, not at all\r\nsuited to this line of acting, in which every thing should be\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nMadame CRÉTU. This actress came to Paris from Bourdeaux, preceded by\r\na great reputation. She has been handsome: a clear voice, a good\r\nmethod of singing, a becoming manner of acting, insured her success.\r\nShe is very useful at this theatre, in pieces where the _vis comica_\r\ndoes not predominate.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle PHILIS the elder. This is a pretty pupil of the famous\r\nGARAT. She has a clear pipe, a charming countenance, a quick eye, an\r\nagreeable person, and some taste. She possesses as much merit as an\r\nactress as a singer.[2]\r\n\r\nMadame GAVAUDAN. She is admired for her pretty person, pretty voice,\r\nand pretty carriage. No wonder then that she has greatly contributed\r\nto the success of the little pieces in the style of _Vaudeville_,\r\nwhich have been performed at this theatre.\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles PINGENET. These two sisters are nothing as actresses;\r\nbut seem to aspire to the title of singers, especially the elder, who\r\nbegins to distinguish herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Noble Mothers and Duennas_.\r\n\r\nMesdames DUGAZON, PHILIPPE, and GONTHIER.\r\n\r\nMadame DUGAZON. Twenty years ago she enjoyed a great name, for which\r\nshe was indebted to the bad taste that then prevailed. With large\r\nprominent eyes, and a broad flat nose, she could not be really\r\nhandsome; but she had a very animated countenance. In lyric _drames_,\r\nshe personated country-girls, chambermaids, and princesses. In the\r\nfirst-named cast of parts, she had an ingenuous, open, but rustic\r\nmanner. She played chambermaids in a style bordering on effrontery.\r\nLastly, she represented princesses, but without any dignity, and also\r\nwomen bereft of their reason. The part in which she had the most\r\nvogue was that of _Nina_ in _La Folle par amour_. Her madness,\r\nhowever, appeared not to be occasioned by the sensibility of her\r\nheart. It was too much inclined to the sentimental cast of Sterne's\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nMadame DUGAZON, who ought to have been in possession of a\r\nconsiderable fortune, from the vast sums of money lavished on her by\r\nEnglishmen, is at this day reduced to perform the parts of mothers,\r\nin which she acquits herself so as to deserve neither praise nor\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nMadame PHILIPPE. Under the name of DESFORGES, she shone formerly in\r\nthe part of _Marguerite_ in _Richard, coeur de lion_. Without being a\r\nsuperior singer, she executes her songs with feeling.\r\n\r\nMadame GONTHIER. This actress still enjoys the benefit of her former\r\nreputation. She is excellent in a cast of parts become hacknied on\r\nthe stage; namely, gossips and nurses.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the _doubles_ or duplicates of all these\r\nladies, as they are, in general, bad copies of the originals.\r\n\r\nThe choruses of the _Opéra Comique_ are not very numerous, and have\r\nnot the strength and correctness which distinguish those of the Grand\r\nFrench Opera. Nor could this be expected. The orchestra has been\r\nlately recomposed, and at present consists of a selection of\r\nexcellent performers. The scenery, decorations, and dresses are\r\ndeserving of commendation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or HALE, an Englishman, who wrote _Le Jugement de\r\nMidas_, _l'Amant Jaloux_, and _Les Évenemens Imprevus_, pretty lyric\r\ncomedies, especially the last. Notwithstanding the success of his\r\npieces, this author is said to have died in the greatest distress.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Not long since she set off for Russia, without apprizing\r\nany one of her intention.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The commissioner, appointed by the government to\r\nsuperintend the proceedings of this theatre, has since been replaced\r\nby a _Prefect of the Palace_, whose authority is much the same as\r\nthat exercised when each of the principal theatres in Paris was under\r\nthe inspection of a _Lord of the Bedchamber_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 29, 1802._\r\n\r\nWhenever the pen of an impartial writer shall trace the history of\r\nthe French revolution, through all its accompanying vicissitudes, it\r\nwill be seen that this country owed its salvation to the _savans_ or\r\nmen of science. The arts and sciences, which were revived by their\r\nzeal and courage, united with unceasing activity to pave the way to\r\nvictories abroad, and repair mischiefs at home. Nor can it be denied,\r\nthat every thing which genius, labour, and perseverance could create,\r\nin point of resources, was employed in such a manner that France was\r\nenabled, by land, to make head against almost all Europe, and supply\r\nher own wants, as long as the war lasted.\r\n\r\nThe _savans_ who had effected such great things, for some time\r\nenjoyed unlimited influence. It was well known that to them the\r\nRepublic was indebted for its safety and very existence. They availed\r\nthemselves of this favourable moment for insuring to France that\r\nsuperiority of knowledge which had caused her to triumph over her\r\nenemies. Such was the origin of the\r\n\r\nPOLYTECHNIC SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThis establishment had a triple object; namely, to form engineers for\r\nthe different services; to spread in civil society enlightened men,\r\nand to excite talents which might promote the sciences. Nothing was\r\nneglected that could tend to the accomplishment of a destination so\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, time to reorganize the instruction of corps destined\r\nfor public services, the greater part of which were wholly deficient\r\nin this respect. Some of them, it is true, had particular schools;\r\nbut instruction there was feeble and incomplete. That for military\r\nengineers at _Mézieres_, the best conducted of all, and which\r\nadmitted twenty pupils only, had suspended its exercises, in\r\nconsequence of the revolution. Necessity had occasioned the formation\r\nof a provisionary school, where the pupils received rapidly the first\r\nnotions of the attack and defence of places, after which they were\r\nsent to the armies.\r\n\r\nSuch institutions neither answered the exigencies of the State, nor\r\nconduced to its glory. Their weakness was, above all, likely to be\r\nfelt by men habituated to general ideas, and whose minds were still\r\nmore exalted, and views enlarged, by the revolution. Those men wished\r\nthat the new _School for Public Works_ should be worthy of the\r\nnation. Their plan was extensive in its object, but simple in its\r\nexecution, and certain in its results.\r\n\r\nThe first law concerning the _Central School for Public Works_, since\r\ncalled the _Polytechnic School_, was made on the 20th of Ventôse year\r\nII. (10th of March 1794). From that moment, much zeal was manifested\r\nin making the necessary arrangements for its formation. On the report\r\nmade to the National Convention respecting the measures taken on this\r\nsubject, on the 7th of Vendémiaire year III (28th of September 1794)\r\na decree was passed, directing a competition to be opened for the\r\nadmission of four hundred pupils into this school. The examination\r\nwas appointed to take place in twenty-two of the principal towns. The\r\ncandidates were to answer in arithmetic and the elements of algebra\r\nand geometry. Those admitted received the allowance of military\r\nofficers for their travelling expenses to Paris. They were to have\r\nannually twelve hundred francs, and to remain in the school three\r\nyears, after which they were to be called to the different Public\r\nServices, when they were judged capable of performing them; and\r\npriority was to depend on merit. These services were the duty of\r\nmilitary engineers, naval engineers, or ship-builders, artillerists,\r\nboth military and naval, engineers of bridges and highways,\r\ngeographical engineers, and engineers of mines, and to them were\r\nadded the service of the pupils of the school of aërostation, which\r\nGUYTON MORVEAU had caused to be established at Meudon, for the\r\npurpose of forming the aërostatic company destined for manoeuvring\r\nair-balloons, applied to the art of war, as was seen at _Maubeuge_,\r\n_Fleurus_, _Aix-la-Chapelle_, &c.\r\n\r\nHowever, the conception of this project was far more easy than its\r\nexecution. It was doing little to choose professors from among the\r\nfirst men of science in Europe, if their lessons were not fixed in\r\nthe mind of the pupils. Being unable to communicate them to each\r\npupil in private, they stood in need of agents who should transmit\r\nthem to this numerous assemblage of youth, and be, as it were, the\r\nnerves of the body. To form these was the first object.\r\n\r\nAmong the young men who had presented themselves at the competition,\r\ntwenty of the most distinguished were selected. Philosophical\r\ninstruments and a chemical laboratory were provided for them, and\r\nthey were unremittingly exercised in every part of the plan which it\r\nwas resolved to execute. These pupils, the greater part of whom had\r\ncome from the schools for Public Service, felt the insufficiency of\r\nthe instruction which they had there received. Eager to learn, their\r\nmind became inflamed by the presence of the celebrated men who were\r\nincessantly with them. The days sufficed not for their zeal; and in\r\nthree months they were capable of discharging the functions for which\r\nthey were intended.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. At a time when opinion and power might change from\r\none moment to another, much risk was incurred if a definitive form\r\nwas not at once given to the _Polytechnic School_. The authors of\r\nthis vast project had seen the revolution too near not to be sensible\r\nof that truth. But they wished first, by a trial made on a grand\r\nscale, to insure their method, class the pupils, and shew what might\r\nbe expected from them. They therefore developed to them, in rapid\r\nlectures, the general plan of instruction.\r\n\r\nThis plan had been drawn up agreeably to the views of men the best\r\ninformed, amongst whom MONGE must be particularly mentioned. He had\r\nbeen professor at _Mezières_, and had there given the first lessons\r\nof descriptive geometry, that science so useful to the engineer. The\r\nenumeration of the various parts of instruction was reduced to a\r\ntable, printed by order of the Committee of Public Safety. It\r\ncomprehends mathematics, analysis applied to descriptive geometry and\r\nto the mechanism of solids and fluids, stereotomy, drawing, civil\r\narchitecture, fortification, general physics, chymistry, mineralogy,\r\nand their application to the arts.\r\n\r\nIn three months, the work of three years was explained. A real\r\nenthusiasm was excited in these youths on finding themselves occupied\r\nby the sublimest ideas which had employed the mind of man. Amidst the\r\ndivisions and animosities of political party, it was an interesting\r\nsight, to behold four hundred young men, full of confidence and\r\nfriendship, listening with profound attention to the lectures of the\r\ncelebrated _savans_ who had been spared by the guillotine.\r\n\r\nThe results of so great an experiment surpassed the most sanguine\r\nexpectations. After this preliminary instruction, the pupils were\r\ndivided into brigades, and education took the course it was intended\r\nshould follow.\r\n\r\nWhat particularly distinguishes this establishment, is that the\r\npupils not only receive oral lessons, but they must give in written\r\nsolutions, present drawings, models, or plans for the different\r\nparts, and themselves operate in the laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of Germinal year III (22d of March 1795) the annual\r\ncourses were commenced. They were then distributed for three years,\r\nbut at this day they last two only. At the same time a decree was\r\npassed, regulating the number of professors, adjuncts, ushers, the\r\nholding of the meetings of the council of instruction and\r\nadministration, the functions of the director, administrator,\r\ninspector of the studies, secretary of the council, librarian,\r\nkeepers of the collection of drawings, models, &c.\r\n\r\nSince that epoch, the _Polytechnic School_, often attacked, even in\r\nthe discussions of the _Legislative Body_, has maintained its ground\r\nby the impression of the reputation of the men who act there as\r\nprofessors, of the depth of the knowledge which makes the object of\r\ntheir lessons, and of the youths of superior talent who issue from it\r\nevery year. The law which after many adjournments, has fixed its\r\nexistence is dated the 25th of Frimaire year VIII (16th of December\r\n1799.)\r\n\r\nThe most important changes introduced, are the determination of the\r\nage to be received into this school, which is from sixteen to twenty,\r\nthe reduction of the pupils to the number of three hundred, the rank\r\nwhich is given them of serjeant of artillery of the first class,\r\ntheir pay fixed on the same footing, together with a fund of\r\nassistance for those labouring under difficulties, the obligation to\r\nwear a uniform, the establishment of a council of improvement,\r\ncomposed of three members of the National Institute, of examiners, of\r\na general-officer or superior agent of each of the branches of the\r\nPublic Service, of the director, and four commissioners taken from\r\nthe council of instruction.\r\n\r\nThis council assembles every year, inquires into the state of the\r\nschool, proposes its views of amelioration, respecting every\r\ndepartment, and makes a report to the government. One of its\r\nprincipal functions is to harmonise the instruction with that of the\r\nSchools of Engineers, Artillery, &c. into which the pupils enter\r\nafter the final examination they undergo previously to their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nAfter this, to judge of the advantages of the _Polytechnic School_,\r\nit is sufficient to cast an eye on the printed reports, which present\r\nan account of the persons it furnishes to the different services, of\r\nthose who have been taken from it for the expedition to Egypt, for\r\nthe corps of _aspirans de la marine_ or midshipmen, for entering into\r\nthe line vith the rank of officers, or into the department of\r\ncommissaries of war, (into which they are admitted after their\r\nexamination if no places are vacant in the Schools for Public\r\nService), of those who have been called on to profess the sciences in\r\nthe central schools (Lyceums) of the departments, some to fill the\r\nfirst professors' chairs in Paris, such as at the _Collège de France_\r\nand the _École Polytechnique_, of those, in short, who have quitted\r\nthis school to introduce into the manufactories the knowledge which\r\nthey had acquired. The last-mentioned circumstance has always been a\r\nconsideration for carrying the number of pupils beyond the presumable\r\nwants of the different Public Services.\r\n\r\nYou see that this is no more than a summary  of what might be said\r\nand collected from the journals of the _Polytechnic School_, (which\r\nalready form four volumes in 4to. independently of the classic works\r\npublished by the professors), for giving a complete history of this\r\ninteresting establishment, which attracts the notice of foreigners of\r\nall nations. BONAPARTE takes no small interest in the labours of the\r\n_Polytechnic School_, and has often said that it would be difficult\r\nto calculate the effects of the impulse which it has given towards\r\nthe mathematical sciences, and of the aggregate of the knowledge\r\nimparted to the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe _Polytechnic School_, which is under the authority of the\r\nMinister of the Interior, occupies an extensive range of building,\r\nformerly known by the name of _Le petit Palais Bourbon, contiguous to\r\nthe _Palais du Corps Legislatif_. The different apartments contain\r\nevery thing necessary for the elucidation of the arts and sciences\r\nhere taught; but the pupils reside not at the school: they lodge and\r\nboard with their friends, on the salary allowed them by the nation,\r\nand repair thither only for the prosecution of their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 30, 1802._\r\n\r\nTo judge from the records of the Old Bailey, one would conclude that,\r\nin proportion to the number of its inhabitants, London must contain a\r\ngreater number of dishonest persons of both sexes than any metropolis\r\nin Europe. But, though more notorious thieves and daring robbers may\r\nperhaps, be found in London than in many other great cities, yet I\r\nwill venture to affirm that Paris contains more\r\n\r\nPICKPOCKETS AND SHARPERS.\r\n\r\nHowever superior too our rogues may be in boldness, I apprehend that,\r\nin dexterity, they are far inferior to those to be met with among our\r\nneighbours. To elude a more vigilant inspection, the latter are\r\ncompelled to exert more art and cunning. In this dissipated capital,\r\nwhich is a grand theatre where they can display all their talent, and\r\nfind a greater number of dupes, adventurers and swindlers of every\r\ndescription have long been famous; but it should seem that the\r\nfemales here of that stamp deserve to be no less celebrated.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, I heard of an English lady of quality being\r\ndetected in the very act of secreting a quantity of valuable lace, to\r\nwhich she had taken a particular fancy at a great haberdasher's in\r\nPall-Mall. It was said that she endeavoured to exculpate herself for\r\nthis inadvertency on the ground of being in a pregnant state, which\r\nhad produced an irrisistible longing. However this may be, she might\r\nhere have got a lesson, as will appear from the following instance of\r\ningenuity very lately practised by one of her own sex.\r\n\r\nIn the _ci-devant Palais Royal_, a haberdasher of note keeps a shop\r\nwhere the highest-priced articles of female wear are exhibited,\r\nimmediately on coming from the hands of the manufacturer or inventor.\r\n\r\nThe other day, a lady somewhat turned of thirty, of genteel\r\nappearance and engaging address, entered this shop, and asked to see\r\nsome white lace veils. Several were shewn to her at the price of from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty louis each. These not being sufficiently rich to\r\nplease her taste, others more costly were produced, and she fixed on\r\none of eighty louis in value. Standing before a glass, she\r\nimmediately put on this veil _à la réligieuse_, that is, in the form\r\nof the hood of a nun's dress. Then taking from her bosom her little\r\npurse, she found it to contain no more than twenty louis in\r\nbankpaper, which she paid to the haberdasher as a deposit for the\r\nveil, at the same time desiring him to send one of his men with her\r\nto her _homme d'affaires_ or agent, in order that he might bring back\r\nthe other sixty.\r\n\r\nAs a Parisian tradesman is always extremely glad to get rid of his\r\ngoods, she had no difficulty in carrying her point; and, having\r\nselected from among the shopmen a shamefaced youth of eighteen, took\r\nhim with her in the hackney-coach which she had kept in waiting. She\r\ngave the coachman her orders, and away he drove to a famous\r\napothecary's, in the _Rue St. Honoré_. \"This,\" said she to the\r\nshopman, \"is the residence of my _homme d'affaires_: follow me, and\r\nyou shall have your money.\" She accordingly alighted, and, after\r\nsaying a few words in the ear of the doctor, on whose credulity she\r\nhad already exercised her genius, desired him to take the young man\r\nto his private room, and settle the business, while she remained to\r\nchat with his wife.\r\n\r\nThe unsuspecting youth, seeing the lady on such terms of intimacy in\r\nthe family, made no hesitation to follow the doctor to a\r\nback-parlour, where, to his extreme surprise, he was closely\r\nquestioned as to his present state of health, and the rise and\r\nprogress of the disorder which he had caught through his own\r\nimprudence. The more he denied the circumstance, the more the\r\ndoctor persisted in his endeavours to procure ocular demonstration.\r\nThe latter had previously locked the door, having been apprized by\r\nthe lady that her son was exceedingly bashful, and that stratagem,\r\nand even a certain degree of violence, perhaps, must be employed\r\nto obtain evidence of a complaint, which, as it injured her\r\n_dear boy's_ constitution, disturbed her own happiness and peace\r\nof mind. The doctor was proceeding to act on this information,\r\nwhen the young shopman, finding his retreat cut off, vociferously\r\ndemanded the sixty louis which he was come to receive in payment\r\nfor the veil. \"Sixty louis in payment for a veil!\" re-echoed the\r\ndoctor. \"Your mother begged me to examine you for a complaint which\r\nyou have inconsiderately contracted in the pursuit of pleasure.\" The\r\n_dénouement_ now taking place, the two dupes hastened back to the\r\nshop, when they found that the lady had decamped, having previously\r\ndischarged the coach, in order that she might not be traced by the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe art of purloining a watch, a snuff-box, or a purse, unperceived\r\nby the owner, may, no doubt, be acquired by constant practice, till\r\nthe novice becomes expert in his profession: but the admirable\r\npresence of mind displayed by Parisian sharpers must, in a great\r\nmeasure, be inherited from nature. What can well surpass an example\r\nof this kind mentioned by a celebrated French writer?\r\n\r\nA certain person who had been to receive a sum of money at a\r\nbanker's, was returning home with it in a hired carriage. The\r\ncoachman, not remembering the name of the street whither he had been\r\nordered to drive, got off his box, and opened the coach-door to ask\r\nit. He found the person dead and cold. At his first exclamation,\r\nseveral people collected. A sharper who was passing by, suddenly\r\nforced his way through the crowd, and, in a lamentable and pathetic\r\nvoice, called out: \"'Tis my father! What a miserable wretch am I!\"\r\nThen, exhibiting every mark of the most poignant grief, he got into\r\nthe coach, and, crying and sobbing, kissed the dead man's face. The\r\nbystanders were affected, and dispersed, saying, one to another,\r\n\"What an affectionate son!\" The sharper drove on in the coach, where\r\nhe found the bags of money, which were an unexpected booty, and,\r\nstopping it at a door, told the coachman that he wished to apprize\r\nhis sister of the melancholy accident that had just happened. He\r\nalighted, and shut the coach-door, leaving the corpse as naked as it\r\ncame into the world. The coachman, having waited a long time,\r\ninquired in vain at the house for the young man and his sister; no\r\none had any knowledge of her, him, or the deceased.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was last in Paris, at the beginning of the\r\nrevolution, being shewn a silversmith's shop, whence a few articles\r\nhaving been stolen, the master was induced to examine in what manner\r\nthe thieves gained admittance. Discovering an aperture where he\r\nconjectured that a man's hand might be introduced, he prepared a\r\nnoose with a proper cord, and remained in waiting the following night\r\nto see if they would repeat their visit. At a late hour, when all was\r\nquiet, he perceived a man's hand thrust through the aperture;\r\ninstantly he drew tight the noose, and thought he had effectually\r\nsecured the culprit; but he was mistaken. The fellow's accomplices,\r\nfearing that the apprehension of one of them would lead to the\r\ndiscovery of all, on finding it impossible to extricate him by any\r\nother means, cut off his wrist. When the patrole arrived at the spot,\r\non the call of the silversmith, he was not a little astonished to\r\nfind that his prisoner had escaped, though with the loss of a hand,\r\nwhich remained fast in the noose.\r\n\r\nWith respect to these more daring classes of rogues, every year\r\nalmost produces some new race of them. Since the revolution, the\r\ncriminal code having condemned to death none but those guilty of\r\nmurder, housebreakers, to avoid the penalty of the law, had recourse\r\nto a practice, which put the persons whom they subjected to it to the\r\nmost severe pain. This was to hold their feet to the fire till they\r\ndeclared where all their moveable property was to be found. Hence\r\nthese villains obtained the name of _chauffeurs_. Notwithstanding the\r\nvigilance of the Police, they still occasionally exercise their\r\ncruelties in some of the departments, as may be seen by the\r\nproceedings of the criminal tribunals. I have also heard of another\r\nspecies of assassins, who trained blood-hounds to seize a man by the\r\nthroat in certain solitary places, and then came afterwards, and\r\nplundered him at their ease. When apprehended, they coolly said: \"We\r\ndid not kill the man, but found him dead.\"\r\n\r\nAs in former times, all sentences passed on criminals, tried in\r\nParis, whether condemned to die or not, are put into execution on the\r\n\r\nPLACE DE GRÈVE.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence executed here was that passed on _Marguerite\r\nPorette_, a female heretic, who was burnt alive in the year 1310.\r\n\r\nAmong the punishments which it has been found necessary to\r\nre-establish is that of marking with a hot iron. Criminals, condemned\r\nto imprisonment in irons, are exposed for two hours on a scaffold in\r\nthe middle of this square. They are seated and tied to a post, having\r\nabove them a label with the words of their sentence. They are clad in\r\nwoollen pantaloons and a waistcoat with sleeves, one half of each of\r\nwhich is white; the other, brown. After being exposed two hours, they\r\nare stripped, and to their shoulder is applied a hot iron, which\r\nthere leaves the impression of the letter V, for _voleur_, thief.\r\nWomen, not being condemned to imprisonment in irons; are exempt from\r\nthe penalty of being marked. This punishment is said to produce\r\nconsiderable effect on the culprits, as well as on the spectators.\r\nPreviously to its being revived, persons convicted of thieving were\r\ninsolent beyond all endurance.\r\n\r\nThe _Place de Grève_ is a parallelogram, one of the long sides of\r\nwhich is occupied by the _ci-devant Hôtel de Ville_, a tasteless\r\nedifice, begun in 1533, but not finished till 1605.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the _Place de Grève_ was alternately the\r\ntheatre of punishments and rejoicings. On the same pavement, where\r\nscaffolds were erected for the execution of criminals, rose superb\r\nedifices for public festivals.\r\n\r\nHere, when any criminal of note was to suffer, the occupiers of the\r\nadjoining houses made a rich harvest by letting their apartments.\r\nEvery window that commanded a view of the horrid scene, was then\r\nhired at a most exorbitant price. Women of the first rank and\r\nfashion, decked in all the luxury of dress, graced even the uppermost\r\nstories. These weak-nerved females, who would have fainted at the\r\nsight of a spider mangling a fly, stood crowded together, calmly\r\nviewing the agonies of an expiring malefactor, who, after having been\r\nracked on the wheel, was, perhaps, denied the _coup de grace_ which\r\nwould, in an instant, have rid him of his miserable existence.\r\n\r\nThe death of a regicide was a sort of gala to these belles; while the\r\nlead was melting over the furnace, the iron pinchers heating in the\r\nfire, and the horses disposed for tearing asunder the four quarters\r\nof the victim of the laws, some of them amused themselves with an\r\ninnocent game at cards, in sight of all these terrible preparations,\r\nfrom which a man of ordinary feeling would avert his looks with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nHow happens it that, in all countries on the continent, ladies flock\r\nto these odious spectacles? Every where, I believe, the populace run\r\nto behold them; but that a female of superior birth and breeding can\r\ndeliberately seek so inhuman a gratification is a mystery which I\r\ncannot explain, unless, indeed, on the principle of shewing\r\nthemselves, as well as that of seeing the show.\r\n\r\n  \"_Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsæ_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 2, 1802._\r\n\r\nIndependently of the general organization of Public Instruction,\r\naccording to the new plan, of which I have before traced you the\r\nleading features, there exist several schools appropriate to\r\ndifferent professions, solely devoted to the Public Service, and\r\nwhich require particular knowledge in the arts and sciences. Hence\r\nthey bear the generic name of\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES.\r\n\r\nThey are comprised under the following denominations.\r\n\r\n  POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL.\r\n  SCHOOL OF ARTILLERY.\r\n            MILITARY ENGINEERS.\r\n            BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS.\r\n            MINES.\r\n            NAVAL ENGINEERS.\r\n            NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nIn order to be admitted into any of the above schools, the candidates\r\nmust prove themselves qualified by the preliminary instruction\r\nrequired the examinations at the competition prescribed for each of\r\nthem. The pupils of these schools receive a salary from the nation.\r\nAt the head of them is the _Polytechnic School_, of which I have\r\nalready spoken. This is the grand nursery, whence the pupils, when\r\nthey have attained a sufficient degree of perfection, are\r\ntransplanted into the other _Schools for Public Services_. Next come\r\nthe\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nThere are eight of these in the places where the regiments of\r\nartillery are garrisoned. The pupils who are sent thither as\r\nofficers, after having been examined, apply their knowledge to the\r\narts, to the construction of works, and to the manoeuvres of war\r\ndependent on artillery. Each school, in which the pupils must remain\r\ntwo years longer, is under the superintendance of a general of\r\nbrigade of the corps.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MILITARY ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\nThis school, united to that of Miners, is established at Metz. Its\r\nlabours relate to the application of the theoretical knowledge which\r\nthe pupils have imbibed at the _Polytechnic School_. The objects of\r\nthese labours is the construction of all sorts of works of\r\nfortification, mines and counter-mines, mock-representations of\r\nsieges, attack, and defence, the drawing of plans and military\r\nsurveys, in a word, all the details of the duty of engineers in\r\nfortified places and in the field.\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils is limited to twenty. They have the rank and pay\r\nof second lieutenant. The School of Engineers, as well as the Schools\r\nof Artillery, is under the authority of the Minister at War.\r\n\r\nMuch as I wish to compress my subject, I must observe that,\r\npreviously to leaving the school, the pupils undergo a strict\r\nexamination respecting the objects of instruction before-enumerated.\r\nThis examination is intrusted to a _jury_ (as the French term it)\r\ncomposed of the commander in chief of the school, a general or\r\nfield-officer of the corps, appointed every year by the Minister at\r\nWar, and one of the permanent examiners of the Polytechnic School.\r\n_This jury forms the list of merit, which regulates the order of\r\npromotion._ Can we then wonder that the French have the first\r\nmilitary engineers in Europe?\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS.\r\n\r\nIt was founded in 1787, by TRUDAINE, and continued under the\r\ndirection of PERRONET, chief engineer of this corps, till his death,\r\nwhich happened in 1794. He was then 86 years of age. By his will, he\r\nbequeathed to this school, for the instruction of the pupils whom he\r\nloved as his children, his library, his models, his manuscripts, and\r\nhis portfolios; articles which at this day form an invaluable\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThis school, which is at present established in the _Hôtel de\r\nChatelet_ (formerly belonging to the duke of that name) _Rue de\r\nGrenelle_, _St. Germain_, unites the _dépôt_ or repository of plans\r\nand models to the labours relating to roads, canals, and harbours for\r\ntrade. The number of pupils admitted is fifty. They are taken from\r\nthe _Polytechnic School_, and retain the salary which they there\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe instruction given to them chiefly consists in the application of\r\nthe principles of physics and mathematics to the art of planning and\r\nconstructing works relative to roads, canals, and sea-ports, and the\r\nbuildings belonging thereto; the means of execution, and the mode of\r\nforming plans and estimates of the works to be executed, and the\r\norder to be observed in keeping the accounts.\r\n\r\nThe _School of Bridges and Highways_ is under the authority of the\r\nMinister of the Interior,\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL SCHOOLS OF MINES.\r\n\r\nOne of these schools is established at Geislautern, in the\r\ndepartment of La Sarre; and the other, at Pesay, in the department\r\nof Mont-Blanc.\r\n\r\nThe Director and Professors form a committee for the working of the\r\nmines of Pesay, as well as for the instruction of the pupils. In\r\nconsequence of the report of this committee the _Council of Mines_\r\nestablished in Paris, proposes to the government the measures\r\nnecessary to be adopted. Twenty pupils, who have passed their\r\nexamination at the _Polytechnic School_, are attached to the\r\npractical schools, for the purpose of applying the theoretical part\r\nof their instruction. Extra-scholars, with testimonials of good\r\nbehaviour and capacity, are admitted to be educated at their own\r\nexpense. These schools are also under the authority of the Minister\r\nof the Interior.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF NAVAL ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\nThe _School of Naval Architects_, which existed in Paris, has been\r\nremoved to Brest, under the name of _École des Ingénieurs des\r\nVaisseaux_. No pupils are admitted but such as have been students, at\r\nleast two years, in the _Polytechnic School_. The examination of the\r\ncandidates takes place every year, and the preference is given to\r\nthose who excel in descriptive geometry, mechanics, and the other\r\nbranches of knowledge appropriated to the first year's study at that\r\nschool. When the pupils have proved, in the repeated examinations\r\nwhich they must undergo, that they are sufficiently qualified, they\r\nare sent to Brest (as vacancies occur), in order to apply the theory\r\nthey have acquired to the different works carried on in that port,\r\nwhere they find both the example and the precept, and are taught\r\nevery thing relative to the construction of ships of war and\r\nmerchant-vessels.\r\n\r\nThis school is under the authority of the Minister of the naval\r\ndepartment. The pupils admitted into it, receive a salary of 1800\r\nfrancs (_circa_ £. 75 sterling) a year.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe Schools of Mathematics and Hydrography, established for the navy\r\nof the State, and the Schools of Hydrography destined for the\r\nmerchant-service, bear the name of _Écoles de Navigation_.\r\n\r\nEvery year, there is a competition for the admission of candidates\r\nfor naval employment. The Hydrographical Examiner makes a general\r\ntour to the different ports, where he interrogates the pupils in\r\narithmetic, algebra, geometry, statics, and navigation. According to\r\nthese examinations, they are admitted to the rank of _aspirons de\r\nmarine_ or midshipmen, captains of merchant-ships for long voyages,\r\nmasters of coasting-vessels, pilots, &c,\r\n\r\nBy a late decree of the Consuls, no one can be admitted to the\r\nexamination prescribed for being received as master in the\r\ncoasting-trade, unless he is twenty-four years of age, and has\r\nserved five years on board the ships of war belonging to the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 15th of January, I have shewn you that Public\r\nInstruction is to be divided into four classes: 1. In Primary\r\nSchools, established by the _Communes_. 2. In Secondary Schools,\r\nestablished by the _Communes_, and kept by private masters. 3. In\r\nLyceums. 4. In _Special Schools_. In the two last-mentioned\r\nestablishments, the pupils are to be maintained at the expense of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBefore I particularize the _Special Schools_, I must mention a\r\nnational institution, distinguished by the appellation of\r\n\r\nPRYTANÉE FRANÇAIS.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into four colleges, established at Paris, St. Cyr, St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye, and Compiegne. It was destined for the gratuitous\r\neducation of the children of the military killed in the field of\r\nhonour, and of public functionaries who might happen to die in the\r\ndischarge of their office.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of the Consuls, dated the 1st of Germinal year VIII (22nd\r\nof March 1800) the number of pupils, in each of the Colleges of\r\nParis, St. Cyr, and St. Germain-en-Laye, is limited to two hundred,\r\nand to three hundred, in that of Compiegne. An augmentation, however,\r\nis to be made in favour of the new departments. The pupils are named\r\nby the First Consul. On entering the College, they bring a stated\r\nproportion of necessaries, after which they are wholly maintained at\r\nthe expense of the nation till they have finished their studies. The\r\ngovernment provides for the advancement of those who give the\r\ngreatest proof of good conduct and talent. The pupils cannot remain\r\nin either of these four colleges beyond the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\nAs I have before observed, the Central Schools are, in future, to\r\nbear the name of Lyceums, and the highest degree of public\r\ninstruction is to be acquired in the\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIn these upper schools are to be particularly taught, in the most\r\nprofound manner, the useful sciences, together with jurisprudence,\r\nmedicine, natural history, &c. The Special Schools now in existence\r\nare to be continued, subject to such modifications as the government\r\nmay think fit to introduce for the benefit of the Public Service.\r\nThey are still under the immediate superintendance of the Minister of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nThe _Collège de France_ I have before described: the Museum of\r\nNatural History, the Special School of docimastic Mineralogy and\r\nChemistry, and that for Oriental languages, I shall speak of\r\nelsewhere; but I shall now proceed to give you a rapid sketch of the\r\nothers which I have not yet noticed, beginning with the\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SCHOOL OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\nThis institution was founded in 1648, at the instigation of LE BRUN.\r\nIt was formerly held in the _Place du Louvre_, but is now removed to\r\nthe _ci-devant Collège des Quatre-Nations_, which has taken the name\r\nof _Palais des Beaux Arts_. This is the only school in Paris that has\r\nnever indulged in any vacation. Each professor is on duty for two\r\nmonths. During the first month, he gives his lessons in the school of\r\nliving models; during the other, in the school of the antique,\r\ncalled, _la bosse_. It may not be uninteresting to give you an idea\r\nof the\r\n\r\nCOMPETITIONS.\r\n\r\nEvery year there is a competition in Painting, Sculpture, and\r\nArchitecture, which is to be called _National Prize_. Its object is\r\nto confer on those who have gained the first prize, at present\r\nproposed by the Institute, the advantage of an allowance of 1200\r\nfrancs for five years, which is insured to them at the French School\r\nof Fine Arts at Rome. During their stay there, they are lodged,\r\nboarded, and taken care of, in case of illness, at the expense of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nA competition takes place every six months for the rank of places in\r\nthe schools; and another, every three months for the distribution of\r\nmedals.\r\n\r\nThere is also a prize, of 100 francs, founded by M. DE CAYLUS, for a\r\nhead expressive of character, painted or drawn from nature; and\r\nanother prize of 300 francs, founded by LATOUR, for a half-length,\r\npainted after a model, and of the natural size.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the competition of the school, there is every year a\r\ngeneral competition followed by a distribution of the works of\r\nencouragement, granted to the artists who have distinguished\r\nthemselves most in the annual exhibition of the _Salon du Louvre_. A\r\njury, named by the competitors themselves, examines the different\r\npictures, classes them according to the degree of merit which it\r\nfinds they possess, and the Minister of the Interior allots to each\r\nof the artists _crowned_ a sum in payment of a new work which they\r\nare bound to furnish to the government.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nIn this school, which is held in the _Louvre_, the Professor of\r\nArchitecture delivers lectures on the history of that art, and the\r\ntheory of its different branches, on the orders, and edifices erected\r\nby the ancients, and on the works of Vitruvius, Palladio, Scamozzi,\r\nand Vignole. He takes no small pains to make known the bold style of\r\nGrecian architecture, which the Athenians chiefly employed during the\r\nages when they prided themselves on being a free people.\r\n\r\nThe Professor of Mathematics explains the principles of arithmetic\r\nand elementary geometry, which he applies to the different branches\r\nof civil and military architecture, such as levelling, the art of\r\nconstructing plans, and perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Professor of Stereotomy, in his lectures, chiefly comprises\r\nmasonry and carpentry; he points out the best methods of employing\r\nthose arts in civil and military buildings. His demonstrations relate\r\nto the theoretical and practical part of both branches. All the\r\npupils, and students of architecture are indiscriminately admitted to\r\nthe competition for the great prize of architecture, provided they\r\nare not foreigners.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\nThis establishment, situated in the _Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière_,\r\nwas founded on the 16th of Thermidor year III, (4th of August 1795)\r\nfor the preservation and reproduction of music in all its branches.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of a director, three inspectors of teaching, a\r\nsecretary, a librarian, and thirty-five professors.\r\n\r\nThe director presides over the whole establishment; the inspectors\r\nsuperintend the teaching, examine the pupils, and teach the branches\r\nof study attributed to them by the regulation.\r\n\r\nIn the Conservatory, the instruction is divided as follows:\r\ncomposition, harmony, solfaing, singing, violin, violincello,\r\nharpsicord, organ, flute, hautboy, clarinette, French-horn, bassoon,\r\ntrumpet, trombonne, serpent, preparation for singing, and declamation\r\napplicable to the lyric stage.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the study is effected by a series of lectures,\r\ntreating specially of the relations between the sciences and the art\r\nof music.\r\n\r\nThree hundred pupils of both sexes, taken in equal number from each\r\ndepartment, are instructed gratuitously in the Conservatory. The\r\nprincipal points towards which their studies are directed, are, to\r\nkeep up music in society, to form artists for the execution of public\r\n_fêtes_, for the armies, and for the theatres.\r\n\r\nThese pupils are admitted after an examination, which takes place\r\nfour times a year. Prizes are distributed annually, in a public\r\nmeeting of the Conservatory, to the pupils who distinguish themselves\r\nin each branch of study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_February 2, in continuation._\r\n\r\nTo the preceding brief account of the Conservatory, I shall subjoin a\r\nfew observations on the\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF MUSIC IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nTill the year 1789, this was the country where the greatest expense\r\nwas incurred in cultivating music; yet the means which were employed,\r\nthough very numerous, produced but little effect, and contributed not\r\nto the improvement of that art. Every thing even announces that its\r\nprogress would have been still more retarded, but for the\r\nintroduction of the Italian Opera, in 1645, by Cardinal Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant success of _Orfeo e Euridice_, in 1647, determined the\r\nnational taste in favour of this sort of _spectacle_, and gave birth\r\nto the wish of transplanting it to the French stage. It was in 1659\r\nthat the first opera, with music adapted to a French poem, was\r\nperformed at Issy.\r\n\r\nSince the epoch of the establishment of the French opera, every\r\ndepartment belonging to it, with the sole exception of the singing,\r\nhas been so much improved, that it is become the most brilliant\r\n_spectacle_ in Europe. But, as the lyric theatres in France were\r\nalways obliged to seek recruits among the pupils formed in the\r\nschools maintained by the clergy for the service of public worship,\r\nthe influence of the clerical mode of instruction was felt; and this\r\nwas, in fact, the source of the bad taste which for a long time\r\ncharacterized French singing.\r\n\r\nHad the grand opera in France been continued an Italian one, as it\r\nwas first established, (like those subsequently introduced in the\r\nprincipal cities of Europe) it would have been supported by\r\nperformers formed by the Conservatories of Italy; and the good taste\r\nof those schools would have balanced or proscribed the bad taste of\r\nthe French cathedrals; but the genius of the seventeenth century\r\nchose that the French language, purified and fixed by the writers who\r\nrendered it illustrious, should also become the language of the lyric\r\ntheatre. Musical instruction, remaining entirely subservient to the\r\ncustoms of religion, was unable to keep pace with the rapid progress\r\nof the arts and sciences during that brilliant period.\r\n\r\nAmong the defects of the old system of teaching music, must be placed\r\nthat of confining it to men; nevertheless, the utility of women in\r\nconcerts and plays was as incontestable then as it is at the present\r\nday. Public instruction was therefore due to them in that point of\r\nview; but, had no such consideration existed, they should have been\r\nadmitted to participate in this instruction, in order to propagate\r\nthe art in society. The success of this method would have been\r\ninfallible: as soon as women should have cultivated the musical art\r\nwith success, its naturalization would have been effected in France,\r\nas it has been in Germany and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the musical instruction pursued in the schools\r\nbelonging to the cathedrals was immense, compared with its results in\r\nevery branch of the art. As to composers, they produced but a very\r\n\r\nsmall number, and few of these distinguished themselves; no\r\ninstrumental performer of eminence ever issued from them; and, with\r\nfew exceptions, the singers they formed were very indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of introducing a better method of singing induced the\r\ngovernment, in 1783, to establish a _Special School of Singing and\r\nDeclamation._ This institution continued in full exercise for ten\r\nyears; but, though the celebrated PICCINI was appointed to preside\r\nover the vocal department, the habits of the old school obstructed\r\nits progress, and prevented it from producing the good which was\r\nexpected from it.\r\n\r\nAt the epoch of the dissolution of the monarchical institutions,\r\nthere remained in France only the School of Music of the Parisian\r\nnational guard, and that of Singing and Declamation just mentioned.\r\nThe republican government ordered them to be united, and thus was\r\nformed the _Conservatory of Music_.\r\n\r\nNor let it be imagined that policy has had no share in establishing\r\nthis institution. It has furnished the numerous bands of musicians\r\nrendered necessary by the levy of fourteen armies which France had,\r\nat one and the same time, in the field. It is well known that music\r\nhas done almost wonders in reviving the courage of the French\r\nsoldiers, who, when Victory seemed adverse to them, inclined her in\r\ntheir favour, by rallying to the tune of the _Marseillois_. In the\r\nheat of action, joining their voice to the instruments, and raising\r\nthemselves to a pitch of enthusiasm, they received or dealt out\r\ndeath, while they kept singing this hymn. The French then are no less\r\nindebted to ROUGET DE LILLE than the Spartans were to TYRTÆUS. At the\r\nbeginning of the revolution, they had no songs of the warlike kind,\r\nexcept a few paltry ballads sung about the streets. ROUGET, who was\r\nthen an officer of engineers at Strasburg, was requested to compose a\r\nmartial hymn. Full of poetic fire, he shut himself up in his chamber,\r\nand, in the course of one night, wrote the words of the\r\n_Marseillois_, adapting to them music, also of his own composition.\r\nNotwithstanding this patriotic production, and the courage which the\r\nauthor is said to have displayed during the war, he was twice\r\nimprisoned, at one time on suspicion of royalism; at another, of\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the great number of musicians with which the\r\nConservatory has supplied the armies, it has furnished between two\r\nand three hundred to the theatres, as well in Paris as in the\r\ndepartments.[1] The band of the Consular guard was formed from the\r\npupils of the Conservatory, and sixty of them at present compose the\r\norchestra, known in Paris by the name of _Concert Français_, and the\r\nexecution of which has been much applauded by many celebrated\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\nIts members meet to discuss the theories which may improve and extend\r\nthe different branches of the musical art. They have already laid the\r\nprincipal foundations of a body of elementary works for teaching them\r\nin perfection. _Les Principes élementaires de Musique_, and a _Traité\r\nd'Harmonie_, which is said to have gained the universal approbation\r\nof the composers of the three schools, assembled to discuss its\r\nmerits, are already published. A method of singing, established on\r\nthe best principles of the Italian school, applied to French\r\ndeclamation, is now in the press; and these publications are to be\r\nsuccessively followed by other didactic works relative to the history\r\nof the art.\r\n\r\nA principal cause of the present scarcity of fine voices in France,\r\nis the war which she has had to maintain for ten years, by armies\r\ncontinually recruited by young men put in requisition at the period\r\nwhen the voice is forming, and needs to be cultivated in order to\r\nacquire the qualities which constitute a good singer.\r\n\r\nFormerly, French commerce derived but very little advantage from\r\narticles relating to music; but the means employed by the\r\nConservatory may probably turn the scale in favour of this country,\r\nas well as render it, in that respect, independent of foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, England furnished France with _piano-fortes_,\r\nthe common price of which was from three to five hundred francs.\r\nGermany mostly supplied her with wind and string instruments. German\r\nFrench-horns, though coarsely-made instruments, cost seventy-two\r\nfrancs, and the good violins of the Tyrol were paid for as high as\r\none hundred and twenty. The consumption of these instruments was\r\nconsiderable. Nor will this appear surprising, as previously to the\r\nfoundation of the Conservatory, the instrumental musicians, employed\r\nin the French regiments and places of public amusement, were mostly\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nThe French _piano-fortes_ are now in request in most parts of Europe,\r\nand their price has, in consequence, increased from one thousand to\r\ntwo thousand four hundred francs. The price of French-horns, made in\r\nParis, which, from being better finished, are preferable to those of\r\nGermany, has, in like manner, risen from three to five hundred\r\nfrancs. Parisian violins have increased in proportion.\r\n\r\nWith respect to printed music, the French import none; but, on the\r\ncontrary, export a great deal; and the advantages resulting from\r\nthese two branches of commerce, together with the stamp-duty attached\r\nto the latter, are said to be sufficient to defray the expenses of\r\nthe musical establishments now existing, or those proposed to be\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nBefore I close this letter, I must not omit to mention a very useful\r\ninstitution, for the promotion  of the mechanical arts, established\r\nin the _Rue de l'École de Médecine_, and called the\r\n\r\nGRATUITOUS SCHOOL FOR DRAWING.\r\n\r\nIt was founded in the year 1766, for the instruction of fifteen\r\nhundred children intended for mechanical professions, and was the\r\nfirst beneficent establishment opened in favour of the common people.\r\nLiterature, sciences, and liberal arts had every where public\r\nschools; mechanical arts alone were neglected. The lower orders, by\r\nwhom they were exercised, had no other means of learning them, and of\r\ndeveloping the faculties of their mind, than the blind routine of\r\napprenticeship.\r\n\r\nThe success of this school had progressively caused similar ones to\r\nbe instituted in a great number of towns of France, but most of them\r\nare buried under the ruins of the revolution; that of Paris has\r\nescaped the general overthrow; and, though it has lost a considerable\r\nportion of its revenue, it still admits about six hundred pupils.\r\nThey are taught every thing relative to the mechanical arts, such as\r\ndrawing in all its various branches, military, civil, and naval\r\narchitecture, hydraulics, arithmetic, land-surveying, mensuration,\r\nperspective, stone-cutting, and in short such parts of mathematics\r\nand practical geometry as relate to those different objects.\r\n\r\nThe Gratuitous School for Drawing must not be assimilated to\r\nestablishments intended for improving the taste of those who follow\r\nthe career of the liberal arts. It presents immediately to the\r\nchildren of the lower orders of the people the instruction that suits\r\nthem best. Here, every thing is useful. Not only are the pupils\r\ninstructed _gratis_, but the school furnishes to the indigent,\r\nrecommended by one of the founders, the paper, pencils, and\r\ninstruments necessary for their studies in the classes, and also\r\nmodels for exercising their talents at home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall speak elsewhere of the _Special School of Medicine_ of Paris;\r\nthere are two others, one at Montpellier, and one at Strasburg. At\r\nAlfort, near Paris, is established, on a grand scale, a\r\n\r\nVETERINARY SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIt would lead me too far to particularize every department of this\r\nextensive establishment; but one of these is too useful to be passed\r\nover in silence. Here are spacious hospitals where animals are\r\nclassed, not only according to their species, but also according to\r\nthe species of disorder by which they are affected. Every person may\r\nbring hither sick animals, on paying for their food and medicaments\r\nonly, the operations and dressings being performed and applied\r\n_gratis_.\r\n\r\nThere are also Veterinary Schools at Lyons, Turin, and Rodez.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these schools are to be established, in different\r\nparts of the Republic, the following new _Special Schools_.\r\n\r\nTen of Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThree of Medicine.\r\n\r\nFour of Natural History, Physics, and Chymistry.\r\n\r\nOne of Transcendent Mathematics.\r\n\r\nTwo of Technology.\r\n\r\nOne of Public Economy, enlightened by Geography and History.\r\n\r\nOne of the Arts dependent on design, and, lastly,\r\n\r\nA new Military School.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing enumeration, it is evident that the government can\r\nnever be at a loss for persons duly qualified to perform the duties\r\nof every branch of the Public Service. True it is that the nation is\r\nat a considerable expense in giving to them the instruction which\r\nfits them for the employment; but, in return, what advantages does\r\nnot the nation derive from the exertion of their talent?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In France are reckoned seventy-fire lyric theatres,\r\nexclusively of those in the newly-united departments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 5, 1802_.\r\n\r\nIn one of your recent letters, you interrogated me respecting the\r\nchanges which the revolution had produced in the ceremonies\r\nimmediately connected with the increase and decrease of population.\r\nWhile the subject is fresh in my mind, I shall present the contrast\r\nwhich I have observed, in the years 1789-90 and 1801-2, in the\r\nceremony of\r\n\r\nFUNERALS.\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_, there was no medium in them; they were either\r\nvery indecorous or very expensive. I have been positively assured\r\nthat eighteen francs were paid for what was called a parish-funeral,\r\nand not unfrequently a quarrel arose between the agent of the rector\r\nand the relations of the deceased. However, as it was necessary to\r\nbury every one, the _Commissaire de police_ declared the fact, if the\r\nrelations were unable to pay. Those for whom eighteen francs were\r\npaid, had a coffin in which they were buried; the others were laid in\r\na common coffin or shell, from which they were taken to be put into\r\nthe ground. In a parish-funeral, whether paid or not, several dead\r\nbodies were assembled, that is, they were carried one after the\r\nother, but at the same time to the same ground. They were conducted\r\nby a single priest, reciting by the way the accustomed prayers.\r\n\r\nOther funerals were varied without end, according to the fortune or\r\npleasure of the relations. For persons of the richest class, a\r\nflaming chapel was constructed at the entrance of the house. This\r\nchapel was hung with black cloth, and in it was placed the corpse,\r\nsurrounded by lighted torches. The apartments were also hung with\r\nblack for the reception of the persons who were to attend the funeral\r\nprocession. The priests came to conduct the corpse from the house of\r\nthe deceased. They were more or less numerous, had or had not wax\r\ntapers, according to the will of those who defrayed the expenses. If\r\nthe presentation of the corpse at the parish-church took place in the\r\nmorning, a mass was sung; if in the evening, obsequies only were\r\nchaunted, and the former service was deferred till the next morning.\r\nThe relations and friends, in mourning, followed the corpse. These\r\npersons walked in the procession, according to their degree of\r\nrelationship to the deceased, and besides their complete\r\nmourning-suit, wore a black cloak, more or less long, according to\r\nthe quality of the persons (or the price paid for it), and a flapped\r\nhat, from which was suspended a very long crape band. Their hair,\r\nunpowdered, fell loose on their back. In lieu of a cloak, lawyers,\r\nwhether presidents, counsellors, attornies, or tipstaffs, wore their\r\nblack gown. On the cuff of their coat, men wore weepers, consisting\r\nof a band of cambric. Every one wore black gloves, and likewise a\r\nlong pendent white cravat. People of the highest rank wore _cottés\r\ncrépés_, that is, a sort of crape petticoat, which fell from the\r\nwaist to the feet. This was meant to represent the ancient coat of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nServants in mourning, or pages for princes, supported the train of\r\nthe cloak or gown of persons above the common rank. Other servants,\r\nalso in mourning, surrounded the relations and friends of the\r\ndeceased, holding torches with his armorial bearings, if he was a\r\n_noble_. Persons extremely rich or very elevated in rank, hired a\r\ncertain number of poor (from fifty to three hundred), over whom were\r\nthrown several ells of coarse iron gray cloth, to which no particular\r\nform was given. They walked before the corpse, holding large lighted\r\ntorches. The procession was closed by the carriages of persons\r\nbelonging to it; and their owners did not get into them till their\r\nreturn from the funeral. Sometimes on coming out of the\r\nparish-church, where the presentation of the corpse was\r\nindispensable, the rector performing the office of magistrate in\r\nregard to the delivery of the certificate of presentation, the\r\ncorpse was carried into a particular church to be buried. This was\r\nbecome uncommon before the revolution, as to do this it was\r\nnecessary to possess a vault, or pay extremely dear, it being\r\nprohibited by law, except in such cases, to bury the dead in\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nWhen the deceased belonged to a society or corporation, they sent a\r\ndeputation to attend him to the grave, or followed in a body, if he\r\nwas their chief. At the funeral of a prince of the blood, all his\r\nhousehold, civil and military, marched in the procession. The\r\n_corbillard_, or sort of hearse, in which his highness was carried to\r\n_St. Denis_, was almost as large as the moveable theatre which Mr.\r\nFlockton transports from fair to fair in England. Calculated in\r\nappearance for carrying the body of a giant, it was decorated with\r\nescutcheons, and drawn by eight horses, also caparisoned to\r\ncorrespond with the hearse. These, however, were but the trappings of\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nWhile this funereal car moved slowly forward amidst a concourse of\r\nmourners, its three-fold hangings concealed from the eye of the\r\nobserver the journeymen coach and harness makers, drinking, and\r\nplaying at dice on the lid of his highness's coffin, by way of\r\ndispelling the _ennui_ of the journey. These careless fellows were\r\nplaced there to be at hand to repair any accident that might happen\r\non the road; so, while, on the outside of the hearse, all wore the\r\nappearance of sadness; within, all was mirth; no bad image of the\r\nreverse of grandeur and the emptiness of human ostentation.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ceremonies observed in funerals before the revolution.\r\nPassing over the interval, from its commencement in 1789 to the end\r\nof the year 1801, I shall describe those practised at the present\r\nday. It now depends on the relations to have the corpse presented at\r\nthe parish-church; but there are many persons who dispense with this\r\nceremony. The priests receive the corpse at the door of the church.\r\nIt is carried thither in a _corbillard_. Each municipality has its\r\nown, and there are twelve municipalities in Paris. Some of them have\r\nadopted the Egyptian style; some, the Greek; and others, the Roman,\r\nfor the fashion of their _corbillard_, according to the taste of the\r\nmunicipality who ordered its construction. It is drawn by two horses\r\nabreast, caparisoned somewhat like those of our hearses. The coachman\r\nand the four bearers are clothed in iron gray or black. An officer of\r\nthe police, also clothed in black, and holding a cane with an ivory\r\nhead, walks before the _corbillard_ or hearse. Each corpse has its\r\nparticular coffin furnished by the municipality. Arrangements have\r\nbeen so made that the rich are made to pay for the poor. The coffin\r\nis covered with a black cloth, without a cross, for fear of scaring\r\nphilosophers and protestants. The relations follow on foot, or in\r\ncarriages, even in town. Few of them are in mourning, and still fewer\r\nwear a cloak.\r\n\r\nAt the _Sainte Chapelle_, near the _Palais de Justice_, is a private\r\nestablishment where, mourning is let out for hire. Here are to be had\r\n_corbillards_ on a more elegant plan. These are carriages hung on\r\nsprings, and bearing much resemblance to our most fashionable\r\nsociables with a standing awning; so much so, that the first of them\r\nI saw I mistook for a _mourning_ sociable. Some are ornamented with\r\nblack feathers. Caparisons, hangings, every thing is in black, as\r\nwell as the coachman. This speculator also lets out mourning coaches,\r\nblack without and within, like those in use in London. At a few\r\nfunerals, these are hired for the mourners, and at a recent one,\r\nfifteen of these carriages were counted in the procession. However,\r\nthis luxury of burials is not entirely come again into fashion. In\r\nthe inside of the church, every thing passes as formerly.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed from the _grave_ to the _gay_, and conclude this\r\nletter with a concise observation on\r\n\r\nMARRIAGES.\r\n\r\nThe _civil_ act of marriage is entered into at the office of the\r\nmunicipality. But this civil act must not be coufounded with the\r\ncontract, drawn up by the notary, and containing the stipulations,\r\nclauses, and conditions. The former signifies merely that such a man\r\nand such a woman take each other for man and wife. There are few, if\r\nany, persons married, who, from the municipality, do not repair to\r\nthe parish-church, or go thither the next morning; the civil act\r\nbeing considered by individuals only as the ceremony of the\r\nbetrothing, and till the priest has given the nuptial benediction,\r\nthe relations take care that the intended bride and bridegroom shall\r\nhave no opportunity of anticipating the duties of marriage.\r\n\r\nPolitical opinions, therefore, prevent but few persons from going to\r\nchurch. Mass is said in a low voice, during which the priest, or the\r\nrector, receives the promise of the wedded pair. With little\r\nexception, the ceremony is the same for all. Those who pay well are\r\nmarried at the high altar; the rector addresses to them a speech in\r\nwhich he exhorts them to live happily together; the beadles perform\r\ntheir duty; and the organist strikes up a voluntary.\r\n\r\nIn regard to marriages, the present and former times presenting no\r\nother contrast, I have nothing more to add on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 6, 1803._\r\n\r\nThe mode of life of the persons with whom I chiefly associate here,\r\nprecludes me from reading as much as I could wish, either for\r\ninstruction or amusement. This, you will say, I ought not to regret;\r\nfor a traveller visits foreign countries to study mankind, not books.\r\nUnquestionably, the men who, like splendid folios in a library, make\r\nat present the most conspicuous figure in this metropolis, are worth\r\nstudying; and, could we lay them open to our inspection, as we do\r\nbooks of a common description, it would be extremely entertaining to\r\nturn them over every morning, till we had them, in a manner, by\r\nheart. But I rather apprehend that they partake, more or less, of the\r\nqualities of a book just come out of the hands of the binder, which\r\nit is difficult to open. Let us therefore content ourselves with\r\nviewing them as we would volumes of a superbly-bound edition, not to\r\nbe examined by the general observer, and direct our eyes to such\r\nobjects as are fully exposed to investigation.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, there are several public libraries, the greater part of\r\nthem open every day; but that which eclipses all the others, is the\r\n\r\nBIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE.\r\n\r\nCharles V, justly surnamed the _Wise_, from the encouragement he gave\r\nto learning, may be considered as the first founder of this library.\r\nAccording to the President Henault, that king had collected nine\r\nhundred volumes; whereas king John, his father, possessed not twenty.\r\nThis collection was placed in a tower of the _Louvre_, called _La\r\nTour de la Librairie_, which was lighted up every night, in order\r\nthat the learned might pursue their studies there at all hours.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Charles VI, in 1423, the inventory amounted to no\r\nmore than one hundred and twenty volumes, though several works had\r\nbeen added, because on the other hand, a great number had been lost.\r\n\r\nWhen Paris fell into the power of the English, in 1429, the Duke of\r\nBedford, then regent of France, purchased these books, for which he\r\npaid 1200 livres, and the library was entirely dispersed. Charles\r\nVII, being continually engaged in war, could not concern himself in\r\nits re-estahlishment. Lewis XI collected the remains scattered in\r\ndifferent royal residences, and availed himself of the resources\r\nafforded by the invention of printing, which was discovered at\r\nStrasburg or Mentz in 1440.\r\n\r\nPrinters, however, were not established in Paris till 1470, and in\r\nthat same year, they dedicated to Lewis XI one of the first books\r\nwhich they printed. Books were, at this time, very scarce and dear,\r\nand continued so for several years, both before and after the\r\ndiscovery of that invention. Twenty thousand persons then subsisted\r\nin France by the sale of the books which they transcribed. This was\r\nthe reason why printing was not at first more encouraged.\r\n\r\nCharles VIII added to this literary establishment such works as he\r\nwas able to obtain in his conquest of Naples. Lewis XII increased it\r\nby the library of Potrarch. Francis I enriched it with Greek\r\nmanuscripts; but what most contributed to augment the collection was\r\nthe ordinance of Henry II, issued in 1556, which enjoined booksellers\r\nto furnish the royal libraries with a copy on vellum of all the works\r\nprinted by privilege; and, under the subsequent reigns, it gradually\r\nacquired that richness and abundance which, before the revolution,\r\nhad caused it to be considered as one of the first libraries in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, the _Bibliothèque du Roi_, as it was till then called, was\r\nreckoned to contain one hundred and eighty thousand printed volumes,\r\neighty thousand manuscripts, a prodigious numbcr of medals, antiques,\r\nand engraved stones, six thousand port-folios of prints, and two\r\nthousand engraved plates. But, under its present denomination of\r\n_Bibliothèque Nationale_, it has been considerably augmented.\r\nAgreeably to your desire, I shall point out whatever is most\r\nremarkable in these augmentations.\r\n\r\nThe buildings, which, since the year 1721, contain this vast\r\ncollection, formally made part of the _Hôtel Mazarin_. The entrance\r\nis by the _Rue de la Loi_. It is at present divided into four\r\ndepartments, and is managed by a conservatory, composed of eight\r\nmembers, namely:\r\n\r\n1. Two conservators for the printed books, M. M. CAPPERONNIER and\r\nVAN-PRAET.\r\n\r\n2. Three for the manuscripts, M. M. LANGLÈS, LAPORTE DUTHEIL, and\r\nDACIER.\r\n\r\n3. Two for the antiques, medals, and engraved stones, M. M. MILLIN\r\nand GOSSELIN.\r\n\r\n4. One for the prints and engraved plates, M. JOLY.\r\n\r\nThe first department, containing the printed books, occupies, on the\r\nfirst floor of the three sides of the court, an extent of about nine\r\nhundred feet by twenty-four in breadth. The rooms, which receive\r\nlight on one side only, are equal in height. In the second room to\r\nthe right is the _Parnasse Français_, a little mountain, in bronze,\r\ncovered with figures a foot high, and with medals, representing\r\nFrench poets. Lewis XIV here occupies a distinguished place under the\r\nfigure of Apollo. It was a present made by TITON DU TILLET.\r\n\r\nIn another of these rooms, built on purpose, are a pair of globes of\r\nan extraordinary size, constructed, in 1683, by Father CORONELLI, a\r\nJesuit, for Cardinal D'ESTRÉES, who presented them to Lewis XIV. The\r\nfeet of these globes rest in a lower apartment; while their\r\nhemispheres project by two apertures made in the floor of fhe first\r\nstory, and are thus placed within reach of the observer. Their\r\ndiameter is eleven feet, eleven inches. The celebrated BUTTERFIELD\r\nmade for them two brass circles, (the one for the meridian, the other\r\nfor the horizon), each eighteen feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1789, the department of printed books has received an\r\naugmentation of one hundred and forty thousand volumes, either\r\narising from private acquisitions, or collected in France, Italy,\r\nHolland, Germany, or Belgium. Among these is a valuable series of\r\nworks, some more scarce than others, executed in the XVth century,\r\nwhich has rendered this department one of the most complete in\r\nEurope. I shall abstain from entering into a detail of the articles\r\nassembled in it, several of which deserve particular notice. A great\r\nmany ancient specimens of the typographical art are on vellum, and\r\ngive to this collection a value which it would be no easy matter to\r\nappreciate. All the classes of it present a great number, the\r\nenumeration of which would far exceed my limits.\r\n\r\nThe department of manuscripts, which is placed in a gallery one\r\nhundred and forty feet in length, by twenty-two in breadth, has been\r\nincreased in proportion to that of the printed books. The library of\r\nVersailles, that of several emigrants, the chapters of various\r\ncathedrals, the Sorbonne, the _Collège de Navarre_ in Paris, and the\r\ndifferent suppressed religious corporations, have enriched it with\r\nupwards of twenty thousand volumes; eight thousand of these belonged\r\nto the library of _St. Germain-des-Prês_, which was burnt in 1793-4,\r\nand was immensely rich in manuscripts and old printed hooks.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen hundred volumes have been taken from Italy, Holland,\r\nand Germany. Among those arrived from Italy, we must distinguish the\r\noriginal manuscript of RUFFIN, a priest of Aquilea, who lived in the\r\nIVth century, containing, on papyrus or Egyptian paper, the Latin\r\ntranlation of the Jewish antiquities of FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS; the grammar\r\nof PROBUS or PALÆMON, a manuscript of the Vth century, on vellum, in\r\nuncial characters; a very beautiful volume in Syriac, containing the\r\nFour Evangelists, a manuscript on vellum of the VIth century; the two\r\ncelebrated manuscripts of Virgil of the VIIth century, the one from\r\nthe Vatican, the other from Florence, both on vellum. A roll, in good\r\npreservation, composed of several skins, sewed together, containing\r\nthe Pentateuch in Hebrew, a manuscript of the IXth century. A\r\nTerence, with figures of the time and a representation of the masks\r\nintroduced on the stage by the ancients, together with the various\r\npoetical works of PRUDENTIUS; manuscripts on vellum of the IXth\r\ncentury. The Terence is that of the Vatican, in praise of which\r\nMadame DACIER speaks in her translation.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, which had so long\r\nconstituted the ornament of the library of Brussels, now increase the\r\nfame of those which the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ already possessed of\r\nthis description. Their number is about five hundred volumes; the\r\ngreater part of them are remarkable for the beauty and richness of\r\nthe miniatures by which they are embellished, and one scarcely\r\ninferior in magnificence to the primer of Anne de Bretagne, wife of\r\nLewis XII, to that of Cardinal Richelieu, to the primer and battles\r\nof Lewis XIV, and to a heap of other manuscripts which rendered this\r\n_ci-devant Bibliothèque du Roi_ so celebrated in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nFive large apartments on the second floor are occupied by titles and\r\ngenealogies, which are still preserved here, in about five thousand\r\nportfolios or boxes, for the purpose of verifying the claims to\r\nproperty, and assisting the historian in his researches.\r\n\r\nThe department of medals, antiques and engraved stones has, since\r\n1789, also experienced an abundant augmentation. The medals are in a\r\ncabinet at the end of the Library; the antiques are in another, above\r\nit, on the second floor.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, the engraved stones which had been previously locked up in\r\nthe drawers of the council-chamber at Versailles, were conveyed\r\nhither, to the number of eight hundred. It would be too tedious to\r\ndwell on the beauty, merit, and scarceness of these stones, as well\r\nas on their finished workmanship and degree of antiquity. Among them,\r\nthe beautiful ring, called the _seal of Michael Angelo_, claims\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, some antiquities which constituted part of the treasure of\r\n_St. Denis_, were brought hither from that abbey. Among these\r\nvaluable articles, we must particularly distinguish the chalice of\r\nthe Abbot SUGER; a vase of sardonyx, with two handles formed of\r\nraised snakes, on which are represented, with admirable art,\r\nceremonies relating to the worship of Bacchus; a large gold cup,\r\nornamented with enamel of various colours; a very large urn of\r\nporphyry, which formerly served as a sepulchral monument; several\r\nbaptismal fonts; the arm-chair of King Dagobert, a piece of very\r\nextraordinary workmanship for the time in which it was executed.\r\nAmong the valuable articles removed hither from _La Sainte Chapelle_\r\nin Paris, in the same year, are to be particularly remarked a\r\nsardonyx, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and commonly\r\ncalled _l'agathe de la Sainte Chapelle_. This stone is the largest\r\nand rarest known of that species. It was brought to France in the\r\nyear 1383 by king Charles V.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1792 the cabinet of medals of _St. Geneviève_, forming\r\nin the whole seventeen thousand articles, and its fine collection of\r\nantique monuments, increased the new riches accumulated in the\r\n_Bibliothèque Nationale_. In 1794, a beautiful series of antiquities,\r\nconsisting of a great number of imperial medals, of nations, cities,\r\nand kings, of all sizes, in gold, silver, and bronze, together with\r\nlittle painted figures, busts, instruments of sacrifices, &c. arrived\r\nhere from Holland.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the department of medals was also enriched by several\r\narticles from the _Garde-Meuble_ or Jewel-Office. Among them were\r\nsome suits of armour belonging to several of the kings of France,\r\nparticularly that of Francis I, that of Henry IV, and that of Lewis\r\nXIV. These were accompanied by a quantity of arms, helmets, shields,\r\nbreast-plates, and weapons used in the ancient tournaments, as well\r\nas quivers, bows, arrows, swords, &c.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1798 and in 1799, several valuable\r\narticles arrived here from Italy, among which are two crowns of gold,\r\nenriched with precious stones, worn by the ancient kings of Lombardy,\r\nat the time of their coronation; the engraved stones and medals of\r\nthe Pope's cabinet; a head of Jupiter Ægiochus, on a ground of\r\nsardonyx, a master-piece of art, which is above all eulogium; the\r\ncelebrated Isiac table, in copper incrustated with silver, a valuable\r\ntable of Egyptian mythology, which is presumed to have been executed,\r\neither at Alexandria or at Rome, in the first or second century of\r\nthe christian era; some oriental weapons; a _fetfa_ or diploma of the\r\nGrand Signior contained in a silk purse, &c.\r\n\r\nThe department of prints and engraved plates, formed of the\r\ncelebrated cabinets of MAHOLLES, BERINGHEN, GAIGNIÈRES, UXELLES,\r\nBEGON, GAYLUS, FONTETTE, MARIETTE, &c. contained, before the\r\nrevolution the most ample, rich, and valuable collection in Europe.\r\nIt is placed in the _entresol_, and is divided into twelve classes.\r\n\r\nThe first class comprehends sculptors, architectural engineers, and\r\nengravers, from the origin of the French nation to the present day,\r\narranged in schools.\r\n\r\nThe second, prints, emblems, and devices of piety.\r\n\r\nThe third, every thing relative to fables and Greek and Roman\r\nantiquities.\r\n\r\nThe fourth, medals, coins, and heraldry.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, public festivals, cavalcades, and tournaments.\r\n\r\nThe sixth, arts and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, prints relating to novels and books of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe eighth, natural history in all its branches.\r\n\r\nThe ninth, geography.\r\n\r\nThe tenth, plans and elevations of ancient and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh, portraits of all professions, to the number of upwards\r\nof fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth, a collection of the fashions and dresses of almost every\r\ncountry in the world.\r\n\r\nSince 1789, the augmentations made to it are considerable. Among\r\nthese must be distinguished four hundred and thirty-five volumes\r\nbrought from the library of Versailles, and fifty-two others,\r\ninfinitely valuable, respecting China, found at the residence of M.\r\nBERTIN, Minister, about eight thousand prints brought from Holland,\r\nthe greater part of them, very fine impressions; and about twelve\r\nthousand collected by different emigrants, almost all modern, indeed,\r\nbut one half of which are select, and remarkable for their fine\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nAmong five hundred volumes, obtained from the suppressed religious\r\ncorporations, are to be remarked one hundred and nine port-folios\r\nfrom the abbey of _St. Victor_, in Paris, containing a beautiful\r\nseries of mythological, historical, and typographical subjects. This\r\nforms a valuable addition to the collection of the same kind of which\r\nthe department of prints was already in possession.\r\n\r\nIn one hundred and forty-four volumes brought from Cologne, there are\r\nseveral scarce and singular engravings.\r\n\r\nAs for sixty articles sent from Italy, they are, with the exception\r\nof the _Museum Pio-Clementinum_, in such a state of degradation that\r\nthey are scarcely fit for any thing but to mark the place which each\r\ncomposition has to occupy.\r\n\r\nSince 1789, the department of prints has made several acquisitions\r\ndeserving of notice, such as the works of LEBAS, MARCENAY, and RODE,\r\nall extremely difficult to find complete, and three hundred and\r\nseventeen plates sent from Germany by FHAUENHOTZ; most of them\r\nexecuted by foreign engravers, and some are very capital.\r\n\r\nA few well-known distinguished artists and amateurs, among whom I\r\nmust not omit to name DENON, ST. AUBIN, and LAMOTTE, a merchant at\r\nHavre, have generously enriched the department of prints with a great\r\nnumber of very valuable ones.\r\n\r\nThe library is open every day, Sundays, and days of national fêtes\r\nexcepted, from ten o'clock till two, to persons who wish to read,\r\nstudy, or take notes; and for whom every accommodation is provided;\r\nbut to such as are attracted by curiosity alone, on the Wednesdays\r\nand Fridays of each week, at the same hours. On those days, you may\r\nperambulate in the different rooms of this magnificent establishment;\r\non the other days, walking is here prohibited, in order that students\r\nmay not be interrupted. However, JOHN BULL seems to pay little regard\r\nto this prohibition. Englishmen are frequently seen stalking about\r\nthe rooms at the forbidden time, as if they meant to shew that they\r\ndisdained the rules of propriety and decorum.[1]\r\n\r\nUnder the government which succeeded the monarchy, was established,\r\nwithin the precincts of the _Bibliothèque Nationale_, a\r\n\r\nSCHOOL FOR ORIENTAL LIVING LANGUAGES.\r\n\r\nThe design of this school, _which is of acknowledged utility in\r\npolitics and commerce_, is to qualify persons to supply the place of\r\nthe French droguemans in the East, who, at the beginning of the\r\ntroubles which distracted France, abandoned the interests of their\r\ncountry, and deserted their stations.\r\n\r\nLANGLÈS, president of this school, here teaches the Persian and Malay\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nSILVESTRE DE SACY, literal and vulgar Arabic.\r\n\r\nJAUBERT, Turkish and the Tartarian of the Crimea.\r\n\r\nDANSE DE VILLOISON, modern Greek.\r\n\r\nIn general, very few pupils are instructed here, and the greater part\r\nof those who begin the courses of lectures, do not follow them three\r\nmonths. This fact I gathered from the professors themselves. When\r\nFRANÇOIS DE NEUFCHÂTEAU was Minister, he had attached to this school\r\nan Armenian, named CIREIED, who gave lessons in his native language,\r\nwhich are now discontinued.\r\n\r\nA course of archæology is also delivered here by the learned MILLIN.\r\nThe object of this course is to explain antique monuments, and\r\ncompare them with passages of the classics. The professor indicates\r\nrespecting each monument the opinions of the different learned men\r\nwho have spoken of it: he also discusses those opinions, and\r\nendeavours to establish that which deserves to be adopted. Every year\r\nhe treats on different subjects. The courses which he has already\r\ndelivered, related to the study of medals, and that of engraved\r\nstones; the explanation of the ancient monuments still existing in\r\nSpain, France, and England; the history of ancient and modern Egypt;\r\nsacred and heroic mythology, under which head he introduced an\r\nexplanation of almost every monument of literature and art deserving\r\nto be known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is the intention of the government to remove the\r\n_Bibliothèque Nationale_ to the _Louvre_, or _Palais National des\r\nSciences & des Arts_, as soon as apartments can be prepared for its\r\nreception.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 8, 1803._\r\n\r\nHaving complied with your desire in regard to the _Bibliothèque\r\nNationale_, I shall confine myself to a hasty sketch of the other\r\nprincipal public libraries, beginning with the\r\n\r\nBIBLIOTHÈQUE MAZARINE.\r\n\r\nBy his will, dated the 6th of March 1662, Cardinal MAZARIN bequeathed\r\nthis library for the convenience of the literati. It was formed by\r\nGABRIEL NAUDÉ of every thing that could be found most rare and\r\ncurious, as well in France as in foreign countries. It occupies one\r\nof the pavilions and other apartments of the _ci-devant Collège\r\nMazarin ou des Quatre Nations_, at present called _Palais des Beaux\r\nArts_.\r\n\r\nNo valuable additions have been made to this library since the\r\nrevolution; but it is kept in excellent order. The Conservators, LE\r\nBLOND, COQUILLE, and PALISSOT, whose complaisance is never tired, are\r\nwell known in the Republic of Letters. It is open to the public every\r\nday, from ten o'clock to two, Sundays, Thursdays, and the days of\r\nnational fêtes excepted.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOTHÈQUE DU PANTHÉON.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Bibliothèque Nationale_, this library is said to contain\r\nthe most printed books and manuscripts, which are valuable on account\r\nof their antiquity, scarceness, and preservation. It formerly bore\r\nthe title of _Bibliothèque de St. Geneviève_, and belonged to the\r\nCanons of that order, who had enriched it in a particular manner. The\r\nacquisitions it has made since the revolution are not sufficiently\r\nimportant to deserve to be mentioned. With the exception of the\r\n_Bibliothèque Nationale_, not one of the public libraries in Paris\r\nhas enjoyed the advantage of making improvements and additions. The\r\nlibrary of the _Pantheon_ is open to the public on the same days as\r\nthe _Bibliothèque Mazarine_.\r\n\r\nThe present Conservators are DAUNOU, VENTENAT, and VIALLON. The first\r\ntwo are members of the National Institute.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOTHÈQUE DE L'ARSENAL.\r\n\r\nThis library, one of the richest in Paris, formerly belonged to the\r\n\r\nCount d'Artois. It is destined for the _Conservative Senate_, in\r\nwhose palace a place is preparing for its reception. However, it is\r\nthought that this removal cannot take place in less than a year and a\r\nhalf or two years. It has acquired little since the revolution, and\r\nis frequented less than the other libraries, because it is rather\r\nremote from the fashionable quarters of the town. There are few\r\ninquisitive persons in the vicinity of the Arsenal; and indeed, this\r\nlibrary is open only on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays of every\r\nweek from ten o'clock till two. AMEILHON, of the Institute, is\r\nAdministrator; and SAUGRAIN, Conservator.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this library, you will, doubtless expect me to say\r\nsomething of the place from which it derives its appellation; namely,\r\n\r\nTHE ARSENAL.\r\n\r\nIt is a pile of building, forming several courts between the _Quai\r\ndes Célestins_ and the _Place de la Liberté_, formerly the _Place de\r\nla Bastille_. Charles V had here erected some storehouses for\r\nartillery, which were lent very unwillingly by the Provost of Paris\r\nto Francis I, who wanted them for the purpose of casting cannon. As\r\nwas foreseen, the king kept possession of them, and converted them\r\ninto a royal residence. On the 28th of January 1562, lightning fell\r\non one of the towers, then used as a magazine, and set fire to\r\nfifteen or twenty thousand barrels of powder. Several lives were\r\nlost, and another effect of this explosion was that it killed all the\r\nfishes in the river. Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV rebuilt the\r\nArsenal, and augmented it considerably. Before the revolution, the\r\nfounderies served for casting bronze figures for the embellishment of\r\nthe royal gardens. The Arsenal then contained only a few rusty\r\nmuskets and some mortars unfit for service, notwithstanding the\r\nenergetic inscription which decorated the gate on the _Quai des\r\nCélestins_:\r\n\r\n  \"Ætnæ hæc Henrico Vulcania tela ministrat,\r\n  Tela gigantæos debellatura furores.\"\r\n\r\nNICOLAS BOURBON was the author of these harmonious lines, which so\r\nmuch excited the jealousy of the famous poet, SANTEUIL, that he\r\nexclaimed in his enthusiasm, \"I would have wished to have made them,\r\nand been hanged.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the revolution, the buildings of the Arsenal\r\nhave been appropriated to various purposes: at present even they seem\r\nto have no fixed destination. Here is a garden, advantageously\r\nsituated, which affords to the inhabitants of this quarter an\r\nagreeable promenade.\r\n\r\nThe before-mentioned libraries are the most considerable in Paris;\r\nbut the _National Institute_, the _Conservative Senate_, the\r\n_Legislative Body_, and the _Tribunate_, have each their respective\r\nlibrary, as well as the _Polytechnic School_, the _Council of the\r\nSchool of Mines_, the _Tribunal of Cassation_, the _Conservatory of\r\nMusic_, the _Museum of Natural History_, &c.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these libraries, here are also three literary\r\n_dépôts_ or repositories, which were destined to supply the public\r\nlibraries already formed or to be formed, particularly those\r\nappropriated to public instruction. When the Constituent Assembly\r\ndecreed the possessions of the clergy to be national property, the\r\n_Committee of Alienation_ fixed on the monasteries of the _Capucins_,\r\n_Grands Jésuites_, and _Cordeliers_, in Paris, as _dépôts_, for the\r\nbooks and manuscripts, which they were desirous to save from\r\nrevolutionary destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 9, 1802._\r\n\r\n_Vive la danse!_ _Vive la danse!_ seems now to prevail here\r\nuniversally over _\"Vive l'amour!_ _Vive la bagatelle!_\" which was the\r\nrage in the time of LA FLEUR. I have already informed you that, in\r\nmoments the most eventful, the inhabitants of this capital spent the\r\ngreater part of their time in\r\n\r\nDANCING.\r\n\r\nHowever extraordinary the fact may appear, it is no less true. When\r\nthe Prussians were at Châlons, the Austrians at Valenciennes, and\r\nRobespierre in the Convention, they danced. When the young conscripts\r\nwere in momentary expectation of quitting their parents, their\r\nfriends, and their mistresses to join the armies, they danced. Can we\r\nthen wonder that, at the present hour, when the din of arms is no\r\nlonger heard, and the toils of war are on the point of being\r\nsucceeded by the mercantile speculations of peace, dancing should\r\nstill be the favourite pursuit of the Parisians?\r\n\r\nThis is so much the case, that the walls of the metropolis are\r\nconstantly covered by advertisements in various colours, blue, red,\r\ngreen, and yellow, announcing balls of different descriptions. The\r\nsilence of streets the least frequented is interrupted by the shrill\r\nscraping of the itinerant fiddler; while by-corners, which might vie\r\nwith Erebus itself in darkness, are lighted by transparencies,\r\nexhibiting, in large characters, the words \"_Bal de Société_.\"\r\n--\"Happy people!\" says Sterne, \"who can lay down all your cares\r\ntogether, and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance,\r\nwhich bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth!\"\r\n\r\nIn summer, people dance here in rural gardens, or delightful bowers,\r\nor under marquees, or in temporary buildings, representing\r\npicturesque cottages, constructed within the limits of the capital:\r\nthese establishments, which are rather of recent date, are open only\r\nin that gay season.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the upper classes assemble in magnificent apartments,\r\nwhere subscription-balls are given; and taste and luxury conspire to\r\nproduce elegant entertainments.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not to the upper circles alone that this amusement is\r\nconfined; it is here pursued, and with truer ardour too, by citizens\r\nof every class and description. An Englishman might probably be at a\r\nloss to conceive this truth; I shall therefore enumerate the\r\ndifferent gradations of the scale from the report of an impartial\r\neye-witness, partly corroborated by my own observation.\r\n\r\nTradesmen dance with their neighbours, at the residence of those who\r\nhave the best apartments: and the expense of catgut, rosin, &c. is\r\npaid by the profits of the card-table.\r\n\r\nYoung clerks in office and others, go to public balls, where the\r\n_cavalier_ pays thirty _sous_ for admission; thither they escort\r\nmilliners and mantua-makers of the elegant class, and, in general,\r\nthe first-rate order of those engaging belles, known here by the\r\ngeneric name of _grisettes_.\r\n\r\nJewellers' apprentices, ladies' hair-dressers, journeymen tailors and\r\nupholsterers dance, at twenty _sous_ a head, with sempstresses and\r\nladies' maids.\r\n\r\nJourneymen shoemakers, cabinet-makers, and workmen of other trades,\r\nnot very laborious, assemble in _guingettes_, where they dance French\r\ncountry-dances at three _sous_ a ticket, with _grisettes_ of an\r\ninferior order.\r\n\r\nLocksmiths, carpenters, and joiners dance at two _sous_ a ticket,\r\nwith women who constantly frequent the _guinguettes_, a species of\r\ndancing-girls, whom the tavern-keepers hire for the day, as they do\r\nthe fiddlers.\r\n\r\nWater-carriers, porters, and, in general, the Swiss and Auvergnats\r\nhave their private balls, where they execute the dances peculiar to\r\ntheir country, with fruit-girls, stocking-menders, &c.\r\n\r\nThe porters of the corn-market form assemblies in their own\r\nneighbourhood; but the youngest only go thither, with a few _bons\r\nvivans_, whose profession it would be no easy matter to determine.\r\n\r\nBucksome damsels, proof against every thing, keep them in\r\ncountenance, either in drinking brandy or in fighting, and not\r\nunfrequently at the same _bal de société_, all this goes on at the\r\nsame time, and, as it were, in unison.\r\n\r\nThose among the porters of the corn-market and charcoal carriers, who\r\nhave a little _manners_, assemble on holidays, in public-houses of a\r\nmore decent description, with good, plain-spoken market-women, and\r\nnosegay-girls. They drink unmixed liquor, and the conversation is\r\nsomewhat more than _free_; but, in public, they get tipsy, and\r\nnothing farther!\r\n\r\nMasons, paviours in wooden shoes, tipped with iron, and other\r\nhard-working men, in short, repair to _guingettes_, and make the\r\nvery earth tremble with their heavy, but picturesque capers, forming\r\ngroups worthy of the pencil of Teniers.\r\n\r\nLastly, one more link completes the chain of this nomenclature of\r\ncaperers. Beggars, sturdy, or decrepit, dance, as well as their\r\ncredulous betters: they not only dance, but drink to excess; and\r\ntheir orgies are more noisy, more prolonged, and even more expensive.\r\nThe mendicant, who was apparently lame in the day, at night lays\r\naside his crutch, and resumes his natural activity; the idle\r\nvagabond, who concealed one arm, now produces both; while the wretch\r\nwhose wound excited both horror and pity, covers for a tune the large\r\nblister by which he makes a very comfortable living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 11, 1802._\r\n\r\nIn order to confer handsome pensions on the men of science who had\r\nbenefited mankind by their labours, and who, under the old _régime_,\r\nwere poorly rewarded, in 1795, LAKANAL solicited and obtained the\r\nestablishment of the\r\n\r\nBUREAU DES LONGITUDES.\r\n\r\nAs members of this Board of Longitude, the first institution of the\r\nkind in France, LAGRANGE, LAPLACE, LALANDE, CASSINI,[1] MÉCHAIN,\r\nBORDA,[1] BOUGAINVILLE, FLEURIEU, MESSIER, BUACHE, and CARROCHÉ, the\r\noptician, had each 8,000 francs (_circa_ £. 330 sterling) a year, and\r\nthe assistant astronomers, 4,000. Indeed, the professors of that\r\nscience were in want of pecuniary assistance for the purpose of\r\nforming pupils.\r\n\r\nThe _Bureau des Longitudes_ is on a more extensive scale, and\r\npossesses greater authority than the Board of Longitude in England.\r\nIt is charged with the administration of all the Observatories\r\nbelonging to the Republic, as well as with the correspondence with\r\nthe astronomers of foreign countries. The government refers to it the\r\nexamination of memoirs relative to navigation. Such of its members as\r\nmore specially cultivate practical astronomy in the National\r\nObservatories of the capital, are charged to make all Observations\r\nwhich may contribute to the progress of that science, and procure new\r\nmeans for rectifying the tables of the Sun, as well as those which\r\nmake known the position of the stars, and particularly the tables of\r\nthe Moon, the improvement of which so essentially concerns the safety\r\nof navigation.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the last-mentioned tables induced this Board,\r\nabout three years ago, to propose a premium of 6,000 francs (_circa_\r\n£. 250 sterling) for tables of the Moon. LALANDE recommended to\r\nBONAPARTE to double it. The First Consul took his advice: and the\r\nFrench now have tables that greatly surpass those which are used in\r\nEngland.[2] A copy of these have, I understand, been sent to Mr.\r\nMASKELYNE, our Astronomer-Royal at Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Longitude of France, like that of England, calculates\r\nfor every year Tables or _Ephemerides_, known in Europe under the\r\ntitle of _Connaissance des Tems_. The French having at length\r\nprocured able calculators, are now able to dispense with the English\r\n_Ephemeris_. Their observations follow each other in such a manner as\r\nto render it unnecessary for them to recur to those of Greenwich, of\r\nwhich they have hitherto made continual use. Since the year 1795, the\r\n_Connaissance des Tems_ has been compiled by JÉROME LALANDE. At the\r\nend of the tables and their explanation, it contains a collection of\r\nobservations, memoirs, and important calculations. The French\r\nastronomers are not a little surprised that we publish no similar\r\nwork in London; while Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Gotha, and Milan set us\r\nthe example. It is in the last volumes of the _Connaissance des Tems_\r\nthat JÉROME LALANDE gives the history of astronomy, where you will\r\nfind every thing that has been done in this science.\r\n\r\nThe _Bureau des Longitudes_ also publishes for every year, in\r\nadvance, the _Annuaire de la République_, which serves as a rule for\r\nall the almanacks compiled in France. The meetings of the Board are\r\nheld at the\r\n\r\nNATIONAL OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nThis edifice, which is situated at the farther end of the _Faubourg\r\nSt. Jacques_, was constructed  in 1664, by order of COLBERT, and\r\nunder the direction of PERRAULT, the medical architect, who planned\r\nthe celebrated façade of the _Louvre_.\r\n\r\nThe form of the building is rectangular. Neither wood nor iron have\r\nbeen employed in its construction. It is arched throughout, and its\r\nfour sides stand exactly in the direction of the four cardinal points\r\nof the horizon. Although its elevation is eighty-five feet, it\r\ncomprises but two stories, terminated by a flat roof, whence you\r\ncommand a fine view of Paris. You ascend thither by a winding\r\nstaircase which has a hollow newel. This staircase, consisting of\r\nthree hundred and sixty steps, extends downward to a similar depth of\r\neighty-five feet, and forms a sort of well, at the bottom of which\r\nyou can perceive the light. From this well have been observed the\r\ndifferent degrees of acceleration in the descent of bodies.\r\n\r\nThe subterraneous vaults have served for meteorological experiments.\r\nIn one of them water is seen to petrify on filtering through the rock\r\nabove. They lead to near fifty streets or passages, formed by\r\nquarries excavated in procuring the stones with which great part of\r\nthe city of Paris is constructed.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the year 1777, churches, palaces, whole streets of\r\nhouses, and the public highway of several quarters of Paris and its\r\nenvirons, were on the point of being swallowed up in gulfs no less\r\nvast in depth than in extent. Since then, considerable works have\r\nbeen undertaken to consolidate these subterraneous caverns, and fill\r\nup the void, equally dangerous, occasioned by the working of the\r\nplaster-quarries.\r\n\r\nAn accident of a very alarming nature, which happened in the _Rue\r\nd'Enfer_ in the year 1774; and another, at Montmenil, in 1778, shewed\r\nthe necessity of expediting these operations, which were followed up\r\nwith great activity from 1777 to 1789, when their progress was\r\nrelaxed from the circumstances of the times. These quarries are far\r\nmore extensive than is commonly imagined. In the department of the\r\nSeine alone, they extend under all the south part of Paris, and the\r\nroads, plains, and _communes_, to the distance of several leagues\r\nround the circumference of this city. Their roof, with the edifices\r\nstanding on the soil that covers it, is either supported by walls\r\nrecently built under the foundation of those edifices, or by pillars\r\nconstructed at different periods in several places. The government is\r\nat the expense of providing for the safety of the streets, highways,\r\nand public buildings, but that of propping under-ground all private\r\nhabitations must be defrayed by the proprietor. These ancient\r\nquarries had been much neglected, and the means of visiting them was\r\nequally dangerous and inconvenient. At present, every precaution is\r\ntaken to insure the safety of the persons employed in them, as well\r\nas the stability of their roof; and for the better superintendance of\r\nall the subterraneous constructions of Paris, galleries of\r\ncommunication have been formed of sufficient width to admit the free\r\npassage of materials necessary for keeping them in repair.\r\n\r\nLet us now find our way out of these labyrinths, and reascending to\r\nthe surface of the soil, pursue our examination of the Observatory.\r\n\r\nIn a large room on the first floor is traced the meridian line, which\r\ndivides this building into two parts. Thence, being extended to the\r\nsouth and north, it crosses France from Colieure to Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nOn the pavement of one of the rooms is engraved a universal circular\r\nmap, by CHAZELLES and SÉDILLAN. Another room is called the _Salle aux\r\nsecrets_, because on applying the mouth to the groove of a pilaster,\r\nand whispering, a person placed at the opposite pilaster hears what\r\nis said, while those in the middle of the room, hear nothing. This\r\nphenomenon, the cause of which has been so often explained, must be\r\ncommon to all buildings constructed in this manner.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the _Champ de Mars_, I mentioned that LALANDE obtained\r\nthe construction of an Observatory at the _ci-devant École\r\nMilitaire_. Since 1789, he and his nephew have discovered fifty\r\nthousand stars; an immense labour, the greater part of them being\r\ntelescopic and invisible to the naked eye. Of this number, he has\r\nalready classed thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe CASSINIS had neglected the Observatory in Paris; but when LALANDE\r\nwas director of this establishment, he obtained from BONAPARTE good\r\ninstruments of every description and of the largest dimensions. These\r\nhave been executed by the first artists, who, with the greatest\r\nintelligence, have put in practice all the means of improvement which\r\nwe owe to the fortunate discoveries of the eighteenth century. Of\r\ncourse, it is now as well provided as that of Greenwich. MÉCHAIN, the\r\npresent director, and BOUVARD, his associate, are extremely assiduous\r\nin their astronomical labours.\r\n\r\nCARROCHÉ has made for this Observatory a twenty-two feet telescope,\r\nwhich rivals those of HERSCHEL of the same length; and the use of\r\nreflecting circles, imagined by MAYER, and brought into use by BORDA,\r\nwhich LENOIR executes in a superior manner, and which we have not yet\r\nchosen to adopt in England, has introduced into the observations of\r\nthe French an accuracy hitherto unknown. The meridian from Dunkirk to\r\nBarcelona, measured between the years 1792 and 1798, by DELAMERE and\r\nMÉCHAIN, is of an astonishing exactness. It has brought to light the\r\nirregularity of the degrees, which was not suspected. The rules,\r\ncomposed of platina and copper, which LAVOISIER and BORDA imagined\r\nfor measuring bases, without having occasion to calculate the effect\r\nof dilatation, are a singular invention, and greatly surpass what\r\nRAMSDEN made for the bases measured in England.\r\n\r\nLAPLACE has discovered in the Moon inequalities with which we were\r\nnot acquainted. The work he has published, under the title of\r\n_Mécanique Céleste_, contains the most astonishing discoveries of\r\nphysical theory, the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, the\r\nacceleration of the Moon, the equation of the third Satellite of\r\nJupiter, and the flux and reflux of the sea.\r\n\r\nBURCKHARDT, one of the associated members of the _Bureau des\r\nLongitudes_, is a first-rate astronomer and a man of superior talent.\r\nHe is at present employed on the difficult task of calculating the\r\nvery considerable derangements of the planet discovered by OLBERS at\r\nBremen, on the 28th of March 1801.\r\n\r\nVIDAL has made, at Mirepoix, more observations of Mercury than all\r\nthe astronomers for two thousand years past, and these are the most\r\ndifficult and uncommon.\r\n\r\nDELAMBRE has computed tables of the Sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and\r\nof Herschel; LALANDE, the nephew, has composed tables of Mars; and\r\nhis uncle, of Mercury, which never deviate more than a few seconds\r\nfrom the observations.\r\n\r\nEven during the reign of terror, astronomy was not neglected. Through\r\nthe interest of CARNOT, CALON, LAKANAL, and FOURCROY, the _Bureau de\r\nConsultation des Arts_ gave annually the sum of 300,000 francs\r\n(_circa_ £12,000 sterling) in gratifications to artists.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in 1796, the National Institute, richly endowed, proposed\r\nconsiderable premiums. LALANDE, the uncle, founded one for astronomy;\r\nBONAPARTE, another for physics; and the First Consul has promised\r\n60,000 francs (_circa_ £2,800 sterling) to any one who shall make a\r\ndiscovery of importance.\r\n\r\nFrance can now boast of two young geometricians, BIOT and PUISSON,\r\nwho, for analytical genius, surpass all that exist in Europe. It is\r\nrather extraordinary that, with the exception of Mr. CAVENDISH and\r\nDr. WARING, England has produced no great geometricians since the\r\ndeath of MACLAURIN, STERLING, and SIMPSON.\r\n\r\nThe French tables of Logarithms, printed stereotypically, are cleared\r\nof all the errors which afflicted calculators of every country. Those\r\nof other nations will owe this obligation to Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL no longer looks for comets; but the French astronomers,\r\nMESSIER, MÉCHAIN, BOUVARD, and PONS find some. Last year, JÉROME\r\nLALANDE deposited 600 francs in the hands of his notary, as a premium\r\nto stimulate the efforts of young observers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_February 11, in continuation._\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1803, MÉCHAIN will leave Paris for the purpose of\r\nextending his meridian to the Balearic Islands. He will measure the\r\nlength of the pendulum in several places, in order to ascertain the\r\ninequality of the earth which the measure of the degrees had\r\nindicated. This circumstance reminds me of my neglect in not having\r\nyet satisfied your desire to have a short account of the means\r\nemployed for fixing the standard of the\r\n\r\nNEW FRENCH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\nAmong the great ideas realized during the first period of the\r\nrevolution, must be reckoned that of a uniform system of weights and\r\nmeasures. From all parts of France remonstrances were sent against\r\nthe great variety of those in use. Several kings had endeavoured to\r\nremedy this evil, which was so hurtful to lawful trade, and\r\nfavourable only to fraud and double-dealing. Yet what even _they_ had\r\nnot been able to effect, was undertaken by the Constituent Assembly.\r\nIt declared that there ought to be but one standard of weights and\r\nmeasures, in a country subject to the same laws. The _Academy of\r\nSciences_ was charged to seek and present the best mode of carrying\r\nthis decree into execution. That society proposed the adoption of the\r\ndecimal division, by taking for a fundamental unit the ten-millionth\r\npart of the quarter of the terrestrial meridian. The motives which\r\ndetermined this choice were the extreme simplicity of decimal\r\ncalculation, and the advantage of having a measure taken from nature.\r\nThe latter condition would, in truth, have been accomplished, had\r\nthere been taken, as a fundamental unit, the length of the pendulum\r\nmarking seconds for a given latitude; but the measure of an arc of\r\nthe meridian, executed with the precision to be obtained by the\r\nmethods and instruments of the present day, was extremely interesting\r\nin regard to the theory of the figure of the earth. This influenced\r\nthe decision of the Academy, and if the motives which it presented to\r\nthe Constituent Assembly were not exactly the real ones, it is\r\nbecause the sciences have also their policy: it sometimes happens\r\nthat to serve mankind, one must resolve to deceive them.\r\n\r\nAll the measures of the metrical system, adopted by the Republic, are\r\ndeduced from a base taken from nature, the fourth part of the\r\nterrestrial meridian; and the divisions of those measures are all\r\nsubjected to the decimal order employed in arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish this base, the grand and important work of\r\ntaking a new measure of the terrestrial meridian, from Dunkirk to\r\nBarcelona, was begun in 1792. At the expiration of seven years, it\r\nwas terminated; and the Institute presented the result to the\r\nLegislative Body with the original table of the new measures.\r\n\r\nMÉCHAIN and DELAMBRE measured the angles of ninety triangles with the\r\nnew reflecting circles; imagined by MAYER, and which BORDA had caused\r\nto be constructed. With these instruments, they made four\r\nobservations of latitude at Dunkirk, Paris, Évaux, Carcassonne, and\r\nBarcelona; two bases measured near Melun and Perpignan, with rules of\r\nplatina and copper, forming metallic thermometers, were connected\r\nwith the triangles of the meridian line: the total interval, which\r\nwas 9°.6738, was found to be 551584.72 toises. As the degrees\r\nprogressively diminished towards the south, but much more towards the\r\nmiddle than towards the extremities, the middle of the whole arc was\r\ntaken; and, on comparing it with the degrees measured at Peru,\r\nbetween the years 1737 and 1741, the ellipticity of the earth was\r\nconcluded to be 1/334 the mean degree, 57008 toises; and the MÈTRE,\r\nwhich is the ten-millionth part of the quarter of the meridian,\r\n443.296 lines of the old French toise which had been used at Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, sent from foreign countries, verified all the\r\ncalculations, and sanctioned the results. The experiments of the\r\npendulum made at the observatory, with extreme care, by BORDA,\r\nMÉCHAIN, and CASSINI, with a new apparatus, constructed by LENOIR,\r\nshewed the pendulum to be 0.99385 of the _mètre_, on reducing it to\r\nthe freezing point, and in _vacuo_: this would be sufficient for\r\nfinding again the _mètre_, though all the standards were changed or\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nExact experiments, made by LEFÈVRE-GINEAU, with instruments\r\nconstructed by FORTIN, shewed the weight of the cubic decimetre of\r\ndistilled water, at the point of the greatest condensation to be\r\n18827.15 grains of the pile of 50 marcs, which is preserved here in\r\nthe _Hôtel de la Monnaie_, and is called _Le poids de Charlemagne_;\r\nthe toise being supposed at 13 degrees of the thermometer of 80\r\ndegrees. The scales of FORTIN might give a millionth part and more;\r\nand LEFÈVRE-GINEAU employed in all these experiments and calculations\r\nthe most scrupulous degree of exactness.\r\n\r\nThus the MÈTRE or principal unit of the French linear measures has\r\nfurnished those of the weights; and all this grand system, taken from\r\nnature, is connected with the base the most invariable, the size of\r\nthe earth itself.\r\n\r\nThe unit of the measures of capacity is a cube whose side is the\r\ntenth part of the _mètre_, to which has been given the name of LITRE;\r\nthe unit of measures of solidity, relative to wood, a cube whose side\r\nis the _mètre_, which is called STÈRE.

I mean the\r\n\r\nDÉPÔT DE LA MARINE.\r\n\r\nThis general repository of maps, charts, plans, journals, and\r\narchives of the Navy and the Colonies, is under the direction of a\r\nflag-officer. It is situated in the _Rue de la Place Vendôme_; but\r\nthe archives are still kept in an office at Versailles. To this\r\n_Dépôt_ are attached the Hydrographer and Astronomer of the Navy,\r\nboth members of the National Institute and of the Board of Longitude,\r\nand also a number of engineers and draughtsmen proportioned to the\r\nworks which the government orders to be executed.\r\n\r\nThe title of this _Dépôt_ sufficiently indicates what it contains. To\r\nit has been lately added a library, composed of all the works\r\nrelative to navigation, hydrography, naval architecture, and to the\r\nnavy in general, as well as of all the voyages published in the\r\ndifferent dead or living languages. The collection of maps, charts,\r\nplans, &c. belonging to it, is composed of originals in manuscript,\r\nancient and modern, of French or foreign sea-charts, published at\r\ndifferent times, and of maps of the possessions beyond the seas\r\nbelonging to the maritime states of Europe and to the United-States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nAll the commanders of vessels belonging to the State are bound, on\r\ntheir return to port, to address to the Minister of the Naval\r\nDepartment, in order to be deposited in the archives, the journals of\r\ntheir voyage, and the astronomical or other observations which they\r\nhave been enabled to make, and the charts and plans which they have\r\nhad an opportunity of constructing.\r\n\r\nOne of the apartments of the _Dépôt_ contains models of ships of war\r\nand other vessels, the series of which shews the progress of naval\r\narchitecture for two centuries past, and the models of the different\r\nmachines employed in the ports for the various operations relative to\r\nbuilding, equipping, repairing, and keeping in order ships and\r\nvessels of war.\r\n\r\nThe _Dépôt de la Marine_ publishes new sea-charts in proportion as\r\nnew observations or discoveries indicate the necessity of suppressing\r\nor rectifying the old ones.\r\n\r\nWhen the service requires it, the engineers belonging to the _Dépôt_\r\nare detached to verify parts of the coasts of the French territory in\r\nEurope, or in any other part of the world, where experience has\r\nproved that time has introduced changes with which it is important to\r\nbe acquainted, or to rectify the charts of other parts that had not\r\nyet been surveyed with the degree of exactness of which the methods\r\nnow known and practised have rendered such works susceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the French navy, commanders of ships and vessels are supplied with\r\nuseful charts and atlases of every description, at the expense of the\r\nnation. These are delivered into their care previously to the ship\r\nleaving port. When a captain is superseded in his command, he\r\ntransfers them to his successor; and when the ship is put out of\r\ncommission, they are returned to the proper office. Why does not the\r\nBritish government follow an example so justly deserving of\r\nimitation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 15, 1802._\r\n\r\nAfter the beautiful theatre of the old _Comédie Française_, under its\r\nnew title of _l'Odéon_, became a prey to flames, as I have before\r\nmentioned, the comedians belonging it were dispersed on all sides. At\r\nlength, PICARD assembled a part of them in a house, built at the\r\nbeginning of the revolution, which, from the name of the street where\r\nit is situated, is called the\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE LOUVOIS.\r\n\r\nNo colonnade, no exterior decoration announces it as a place of\r\npublic amusement, and any one might pass it at noon-day without\r\nsuspecting the circumstance, but for the prices of admission being\r\npainted in large characters over the apertures in the wall, where the\r\npublic deposit their money.\r\n\r\nThis house, which is of a circular form, is divided, into four tiers\r\nof boxes. The ornaments in front of them, not being in glaring\r\ncolours, give, by their pale tint, a striking brilliancy to the dress\r\nof the women.\r\n\r\nPICARD, the manager of this theatre, is the MOLIÈRE of his company;\r\nthat is, he is at once author and actor, and, in both lines,\r\nindefatigable. Undoubtedly, the most striking, and, some say, the\r\nonly resemblance he bears to the mirror of French comedy, is to be\r\ncompelled to bring on the stage pieces in so unfinished a state as to\r\nbe little more than sketches, or, in other words, he is forced to\r\nwrite in order to subsist his company. Thus then, the stock-pieces of\r\nthis theatre are all of them of his own composition. The greater part\r\nare _imbroglios_ bordering on farce. The _vis comica_ to be found in\r\nthem is not easily understood by foreigners, since it chiefly\r\nconsists in allusions to local circumstances and sayings of the day.\r\nHowever, they sometimes produce laughter in a surprising degree, but\r\nmore frequently make those laugh who never blush to laugh at any\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThe most lively of his pieces are _Le Collatéral_ and _la Petite\r\nVille_. In the course of last month, he produced one under the name\r\nof _La Grande Ville, ou les Provinciaux à Paris_, which occasioned a\r\nviolent uproar. The characters of this pseudo-comedy are swindlers or\r\nfools; and the spectators insisted that the portraits were either too\r\nexact a copy of the originals, or not at all like them. By means of\r\nmuch insolence, by means of the guard which was incautiously\r\nintroduced into the pit, and which put to flight the majority of the\r\naudience, and, lastly, by means of several alterations, PICARD\r\ncontrived to get his piece endured. But this triumph may probably be\r\nthe signal of his ruin,[1] as the favour of the Parisian public, once\r\nlost, is never to be regained.\r\n\r\nThis histrionic author and manager has written some pieces of a\r\nserious cast. The principal are, _Médiocre et Rampant_, and _L'Entrée\r\ndans le Monde_. As in _La Grande Ville_, the characters in these are\r\nalso cheats or fools. Consequently, it was not difficult to conduct\r\nthe plot, it would have been much more so to render it interesting.\r\nThese two comedies are written in verse which might almost pass for\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nThe _Théâtre Louvois_ is open to all young authors who have the\r\nambition to write for the stage, before they have well stored their\r\nmind with the requisites. Novelties here succeed each other with\r\nastonishing rapidity. Hence, whatever success PICARD may have met\r\nwith as an author, he has not been without competitors for his\r\nlaurels. Out of no less than one hundred and sixty-seven pieces\r\npresented for rehearsal and read at this house, one hundred and\r\nsixty-five are said to have been refused. Of the two accepted, the\r\none, though written forty years ago, was brought out as a new piece,\r\nand damned. However, the ill success of a piece represented here is\r\nnot remarked; the fall not being great.\r\n\r\nThe friends of this theatre call it _La petite Maison de Thalie_.\r\nThey take the part for the whole. It is, in fact, no more than her\r\nanti-chamber. As for the drawing-room of the goddess, it is no longer\r\nto be found any where in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe performers who compose PICARD'S company do no injustice to his\r\npieces. It is affirmed that this company has what is called, on the\r\nFrench stage, _de l'ensemble_. With few exceptions, there is an\r\n_ensemble_, as it is very indifferent. For such an interpretation to\r\nbe correct, it would be necessary for all the comedians of the\r\n_Théâtre Louvois_ to have great talents, and none can be quoted.\r\n\r\nPICARD, though not unfrequently applauded, is but a sorry actor. His\r\ncast of parts is that of valets and comic characters.\r\n\r\nDEVIGNY performs the parts of noble fathers and foolish ones, here\r\ntermed _dindons_, and grooms, called by the French _jockeis_. The\r\nremark, that he who plays every thing plays nothing, has not been\r\nunaptly applied to him. He has a defect of pronunciation which shocks\r\neven the ear of a foreigner.\r\n\r\nDORSAN is naturally cold and stiff, and when he endeavours to repair\r\nthe former of these defects, the weakness of his powers betrays him.\r\nIf he speaks correctly, it is without _finesse_, and he never adds by\r\nexpression to the thought of the author.\r\n\r\nCLOZEL is a very handsome young man. He performs the characters of\r\n_petits-maîtres_ and those of valets, which he confounds incessantly.\r\nThe other actors of the _Théâtre Louvois_ exempt me from naming them.\r\n\r\nAs for the actresses at this theatre, those only worthy to be\r\nmentioned are, Mademoiselle ADELINE, who has a rather pretty face,\r\nand plays not ill innocent parts; Mademoiselle BEFFROI, who is\r\nhandsome, especially in male attire; and Mademoiselle MOLIÈRE, who is\r\na very good _soubrette_. Mademoiselle LESCOT, tired of obtaining\r\napplause at the _Théâtre du Vaudeville_, wished to do the same on a\r\nlarger theatre. Here, she has not even the consolation of saying\r\n\r\n  \"_Tel brille au second rang, qui s'éclipse au premier._\"\r\n\r\nMadame MOLÉ, who is enormous in bulk, is a coarse caricature, whether\r\nshe performs the parts of noble mothers, or what the French call\r\n_caractères_, that is, singular characters.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _ci-devant Comédie Italienne_ in Paris partly owed its prosperity\r\nto the _Vaudeville_, which might be considered as the parent of the\r\n_Opéra-Comique_. They were united, when the _drame_ being introduced\r\nwith songs, had like to have annihilated them both. The _Vaudeville_\r\nwas sacrificed and banished. Several years elapsed before it\r\nreappeared. This offspring of French gaiety was thought to be lost\r\nfor ever; but a few authors had prepared for it an asylum under the\r\nname of\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE DU VAUDEVILLE.\r\n\r\nThis little theatre is situated in the _Rue de Chartres_, which faces\r\nthe principal entrance of the _Palais du Tribunat_. The interior is\r\nof a circular form, and divided into four tiers of boxes. In general,\r\nthe decorations are not of the first class, but in the dresses the\r\nstrictest propriety is observed.\r\n\r\nThe pieces performed at the _Vaudeville_ are little comedies of the\r\nsentimental cast, a very extensive collection of portraits of French\r\nauthors and of a few foreigners,[2] some pastoral pieces, parodies\r\nclosely bordering on the last new piece represented at one of the\r\nprincipal theatres, charming _harlequinades_, together with a few\r\npieces, in some of which parade and show are introduced; in others,\r\nscenes of low life and vulgarity; but the latter species is now\r\nalmost abandoned.\r\n\r\nThese pieces are almost always composed in conjunction. It is by no\r\nmeans uncommon to see in the play-bills the names of five or six\r\nauthors to a piece, in which the public applaud, perhaps, no more\r\nthan three verses of a song. This association of names, however, has\r\nthe advantage of saving many of them from ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe authors who chiefly devote themselves to the species of\r\ncomposition from which this theatre derives its name, are BARRÉ,\r\nRADET, and DESFONTAINES, who may be considered as its founders.\r\nBOURGEUIL, DESCHAMPS, DESPREZ, and the two SÉGURS, also contribute to\r\nthe success of the _Vaudeville_, together with CHAZET, JOUY,\r\nLONGCHAMPS, and some others.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of their talents, these writers suffer no striking\r\nadventure, no interesting anecdote to escape their satirical humour;\r\nbut aim the shafts of ridicule at every subject likely to afford\r\namusement. It may therefore be conceived that this house is much\r\nfrequented. No people on earth can be more fickle than the French in\r\ngeneral, and the Parisians in particular, in the choice of their\r\ndiversions. Like children, they are soon tired of the same toy, and\r\nnovelty is for them the greatest attraction. Hence, the _Vaudeville_,\r\nas has been seen, presents a great variety of pieces. In general,\r\nthese are by no means remarkable for the just conception of their\r\nplan. The circumstance of the moment adroitly seized, and related in\r\nsome well-turned stanzas, interspersed with dialogue, is sufficient\r\nto insure the success of a new piece, especially if adapted to the\r\nabilities of the respective performers.\r\n\r\nAmong them, HENRY would shine in the parts of lovers, were he less of\r\na _mannerist_.\r\n\r\nJULIEN may be quoted as an excellent imitator of the beaux of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nVERTPRÉ excels in personating a striking character.\r\n\r\nCARPENTIER is no bad representative of a simpleton.\r\n\r\nCHAPELLE displays much comic talent and warmth in the character of\r\ndotards, who talk themselves out of their reason.\r\n\r\nLAPORTE, as a speaking Harlequin, has no equal in Paris.\r\n\r\nSo much for the men: I shall now speak of the women deserving of\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nMadame HENRY, in the parts of lovers, is to be preferred for her fine\r\neyes, engaging countenance, elegant shape, and clear voice.\r\n\r\nMesdemoiselles COLOMBE and LAPORTE, who follow her in the same line\r\nof acting, are both young, and capable of improvement.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle DESMARES is far from being pretty; neither is she much\r\nof an actress, but she treads the stage well, and sings not amiss.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle BLOSSEVILLE plays chambermaids and characters of parody\r\nwith tolerable success.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle DELILLE, however, who performs caricatures and\r\ncharacters where frequent disguises are assumed, is a still greater\r\nfavourite with the public. So much has been said of the glibness of a\r\nfemale tongue that many of the comparisons made on the subject are\r\nbecome proverbial; but nothing that I ever heard in that way can be\r\ncompared to the volubility of utterance of Mademoiselle DELILLE,\r\nexcept the clearness of her articulation. A quick and attentive ear\r\nmay catch every syllable as distinctly as if she spoke with the\r\nutmost gravity and slowness. The piece in which she exhibits this\r\ntalent to great advantage, and under a rapid succession of disguises,\r\nis called _Frosine ou la dernière venue_.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle FLEURY makes an intelligent Columbine, not unworthy of\r\nLAPORTE.\r\n\r\nMadame DUCHAUME represents not ill characters of duennas,\r\ncountry-women, &c.\r\n\r\nNothing can be said of the voice of the different performers of this\r\ntheatre, on which acccount, perhaps, the orchestra is rather feeble;\r\nbut still it might be better composed.\r\n\r\nDuring my present visit to Paris, the _Vaudeville_, as it is commonly\r\ncalled, has, I think, insensibly declined. It has, however, been said\r\nthat its destiny seems insured by the character of the French, and\r\nthat being the first theatre to bend to the caprices of the day, it\r\ncan never be out of fashion. Certainly, if satire be a good\r\nfoundation, it ought to be the most substantial dramatic\r\nestablishment in Paris. It rests on public malignity, which is its\r\nmain support. Hence, one might conclude that it will last as long as\r\nthere is evil doing or evil saying, an absurdity to catch at, an\r\nauthor to parody, a tale of scandal to relate, a rogue to abuse, and,\r\nin short, as long as the chapter of accidents shall endure. At this\r\nrate, the _Vaudeville_ must stand to all eternity.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be its defects, it unquestionably exemplifies the\r\ncharacter of the nation, so faithfully pourtrayed by Beaumarchais, in\r\nthe following lines of the _vaudeville_ which concludes the _Mariage\r\nde Figaro_:\r\n\r\n  _\"Si l'on opprime, il peste, il crie,\r\n  Il s'agite en cent façons,\r\n  Tout finit par des chansons.\"      bis._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Théâtre Louvois_ is rapidly on the decline.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: These are pieces the hero of which is a celebrated\r\npersonage, such as RABELAIS, SCARRON, VOLTAIRE, ROUSSEAU,\r\nMALESHERBES, FREDERIC, king of Prussia, &c. &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 17, 1802._\r\n\r\nAfter having traversed the _Pont Neuf_, from the north side of the\r\nSeine, you cannot avoid noticing a handsome building to the right,\r\nsituated on the _Quai de Conti_, facing the river. This is the Mint,\r\nor\r\n\r\nHÔTEL DE LA MONNAIE.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this edifice was suggested by M. LAVERDY,\r\nMinister of State, and executed under the direction of M. ANTOINE,\r\narchitect. I do not recollect any building of the kind in Europe that\r\ncan be compared to it, since it far surpasses the _Zecca_ at Venice.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Terray (whose name will not be readily forgotten by the\r\nState-annuitants of his time, and for whom Voltaire, as one, said\r\nthat he preserved his only tooth) when Comptroller-general of the\r\nFinances, laid the first stone of the _Hôtél de la Monnaie_, in April\r\n1771.\r\n\r\nAn avant-corps, decorated with six Ionic pillars, and supported by\r\ntwo wings, from the division of the façade, which is three hundred\r\nand thirty-six feet in breadth by eighty-four in elevation. It is\r\ndistributed into two stories above the ground-floor. Perpendicularly\r\nto the six pillars, rise six statues, representing Peace, Commerce,\r\nPrudence, Law, Strength, and Plenty.\r\n\r\nIn this avant-corps are three arches, the centre one of which is the\r\nprincipal entrance of the building. The vestibule is decorated with\r\ntwenty-four fluted Doric pillars, and on the right hand, is a\r\nstair-case, leading to the apartments intended for the use of the\r\nofficers belonging to the Mint, and in which they hold their\r\nmeetings. This stair-case is lighted by a dome supported by sixteen\r\nfluted pillars of the Ionic order.\r\n\r\nThe whole building contains six courts: the principal court is one\r\nhundred and ten feet in depth by ninety-two in breadth. All round it\r\nare covered galleries, terminated by a circular wall alternately\r\npierced with arches and gates.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the hall for the money-presses is ornamented by four\r\nDoric pillars. This hall is sixty-two feet long by about forty broad,\r\nand contains nine money-presses. Above it is the hall of the sizers\r\nor persons who prepare the blank pieces for stamping. Next come the\r\nflatting-mills. Here, in a word, are all the apartments necessary for\r\nthe different operations, and aptly arranged for the labours of\r\ncoinage.\r\n\r\nIn the principal apartment of the avant-corps of the _Hôtel de la\r\nMonnaie_, towards the _Quai de Conti_, is the cabinet known in Paris\r\nby the name of the\r\n\r\nMUSÉE DES MINES.\r\n\r\nThis cabinet or Museum was formed in 1778 by M. SAGE, who had then\r\nspent eighteen years in collecting minerals. When he began to employ\r\nhimself on that science forty-five years ago, there existed in this\r\ncountry no collection which could facilitate the study of mineralogy.\r\nDocimacy vas scarcely known here by name. France was tributary to\r\nforeign countries thirty-seven millions of livres (_circa_ £1,541,666\r\nsterling) a year for the mineral and metallic substances which she\r\ndrew from them, although she possesses them within herself. M. SAGE\r\ndirected his studies and labours to the research and analysis of\r\nminerals. For twenty years he has delivered _gratis_ public courses\r\nof chymistry and mineralogy. For the advancement of those sciences,\r\nhe also availed himself of the favour he enjoyed with some persons at\r\ncourt and in the ministry, and this was certainly making a very\r\nmeritorious use of it. To his care and interest is wholly due the\r\ncollection of minerals placed in this building. The apartment\r\ncontaining it has, by some, been thought to deviate from the simple\r\nand severe style suitable to its destination, and to resemble too\r\nmuch the drawing-room of a fine lady. But those who have hazarded\r\nsuch a reproach do not consider that, at the period when this cabinet\r\nwas formed, it was not useless, in order to bring the sciences into\r\nfashion, to surround them with the show of luxury and the elegance of\r\naccessory decoration. Who knows even whether that very circumstance,\r\ntrifling as it may appear, has not somewhat contributed to spread a\r\ntaste for the two sciences in question among the great, and in the\r\nfashionable world?\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the arrangement of this cabinet is excellent,\r\nand, in that respect, it is worthy to serve as a model. The\r\nproductions of nature are so disposed that the glazed closets and\r\ncases containing them present, as it were, an open book in which the\r\ncurious and attentive observer instructs himself with the greater\r\nfacility and expedition, as he can without effort examine and study\r\nperfectly every individual specimen.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the Museum is about forty-five feet in length,\r\nthirty-eight in breadth, and forty in elevation. In the middle is an\r\namphitheatre capable of holding two hundred persons. In the\r\ncircumference are glazed cabinets or closets, in which are arranged\r\nmethodically and analytically almost all the substances known in\r\nmineralogy. The octagonal gallery, above the elliptical amphitheatre,\r\ncontains large specimens of different minerals. To each specimen is\r\nannexed an explanatory ticket. One of the large lateral galleries\r\npresents part of the productions of the mines of France, classed\r\naccording to the order of the departments where they are found. The\r\nnew transversal gallery contains models of furnaces and machines\r\nemployed in the working of mines. The third gallery is also destined\r\nto contain the minerals of France, the essays and results of which\r\nare deposited in a private cabinet. The galleries are decorated with\r\ntables and vases of different species of marble, porphyry, and\r\ngranite, also from the mines of France, collected by SAGE. The cupola\r\nwhich rises above, is elegantly ornamented from the designs of\r\nANTOINE, the architect of the building.\r\n\r\nThis Museum is open to the public every day from nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning till two, and, though it has been so many years an object of\r\ncuriosity, such is the care exerted in superintending it, that it has\r\nall the freshness of novelty.\r\n\r\nIn a niche, on the first landing-place of the stair-case, is the bust\r\nof M. SAGE, a tribute of gratitude paid to him by his pupils. SAGE'S\r\nprincipal object being to naturalize in France mineralogy, docimacy,\r\nand metallurgy, he first obtained the establishment of a _Special\r\nSchool of Mines_, in which pupils were maintained by the State. Here,\r\nhe directed their studies, and enjoyed the happiness of forming\r\nintelligent men, capable of improving the science of metallurgy, and\r\npromoting the search of ores, &c.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years past, as I have already observed, SAGE has\r\ndelivered _gratis_, in this Museum; public courses of chymistry and\r\nmineralogy. He attracts hither many auditors by the ease of his\r\nelocution, and the address, the grace even which he displays in his\r\nexperiments. If all those who have attended his lectures are to be\r\nreckoned his pupils, there will be found in the number names\r\nillustrious among the _savans_ of France. Unfortunately, this veteran\r\nof science has created for himself a particular system in chymistry,\r\nand this system differs from that of LAVOISIER, FOURCROY,\r\nGUYTON-MORVEAU, BERTHOLLET, CHAPTAL, &c. The sciences have also their\r\nschisms; but the real _savans_ are not persecutors. Although SAGE was\r\nnot of their opinion on many essential points, his adversaries always\r\nrespected him as the man who had first drawn the attention of the\r\ngovernment towards the art of mines, instigated the establishment of\r\nthe first school which had existed for this important object, and\r\nbeen the author of several good analyses. On coming out of prison,\r\ninto which he had been thrown during the reign of terror, he found\r\nthis cabinet of mineralogy untouched. It would then have been easy,\r\nfrom motives of public utility, to unite it to the new School of\r\nMines. But the heads of this new school had, for the most part,\r\nissued from the old one, and SAGE was dear to them from every\r\nconsideration. It was from a consequence of this sentiment that SAGE,\r\nwho had been a member of the _Academy of Sciences_, not having been\r\ncomprised in the list of the members of the National Institute at the\r\ntime of its formation, has since been admitted into that learned\r\nbody, not as a chymist indeed, but as a professor of mineralogy, a\r\nscience which owes to him much of its improvement.\r\n\r\nThe new School of Mines is now abolished, and practical ones are\r\nestablished in the mountains, as I have before mentioned. While I am\r\nspeaking of mineralogy, I shall take you to view the\r\n\r\nCABINET DU CONSEIL DES MINES.\r\n\r\nThis cabinet of mineralogy, formed at the _Hôtel des Mines_, _Rue de\r\nl'Université_, _No. 293_, is principally intended to present a\r\ncomplete collection of all the riches of the soil of the French\r\nRepublic, arranged in local order. A succession of glazed closets,\r\ncontiguous and similar to each other, that is about six feet and a\r\nhalf in height by sixteen inches in depth, affords every facility of\r\nobserving them with ease and convenience. On these cases the names of\r\nthe departments are inscribed in alphabetical order, and the\r\nvacancies which still exist in this geographical collection, are\r\ndaily filled up by specimens sent by the engineers of mines, who,\r\nbeing spread over the different districts they are charged to visit,\r\nemploy themselves in recognizing carefully the mineral substances\r\npeculiar to each country, in order to submit their views to the\r\ngovernment respecting the means of rendering them useful to commerce\r\nand to the arts.\r\n\r\nThe departmental collection, being thus arranged on the sides of the\r\ngallery, leaves vacant the middle of the apartments, which is\r\nfurnished with tables covered with large glazed cases, intended for\r\nreceiving systematic collections, and the most remarkable mineral\r\nsubstances from foreign countries, distributed in geographical order.\r\n\r\nAn apartment is specially appropriated to the systematic order\r\nadopted by HAÜY in his new treatise on mineralogy; another is\r\nreserved for the method of WERNER.\r\n\r\nIn both these oryctognostic collections, minerals of all countries\r\nare indiscriminately admitted. They are arranged by _classes_,\r\n_orders_, _genera_, _species_, and _varieties_, with the\r\ndenominations adopted by the author of the method, and consequently\r\ndesignated by specific names in French for HAÜY'S method, and in\r\nGerman for that of WERNER. The proximity of the two apartments where\r\nthey are exhibited, affords every advantage for comparing both\r\nmethods, and acquiring an exact knowledge of mineralogical synonymy.\r\nEach of the two methods contains also a geological collection of\r\nrocks and various aggregates, classed and named after the principles\r\nwhich their respective authors have thought fit to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe other apartments are likewise furnished with tables covered with\r\nglazed cases, where are exhibited, in a manner very advantageous for\r\nstudy, the most remarkable minerals of every description from foreign\r\ncountries, among which are:\r\n\r\n1. A numerous series of minerals from Russia, such as red chromate of\r\nlead, white carbonate of lead, green phosphate of lead; native\r\ncopper, green and blue carbonate of copper; gold ore from Berezof;\r\niron ore, granitical rocks, fossil shells, in good preservation, from\r\nthe banks of the Moscorika, and others in the siliceous state,\r\njaspers, crystals of quartz, beril, &c.\r\n\r\n2. A collection from the iron and copper mines of Sweden, as well as\r\nvarious crystals and rocks from the same country.\r\n\r\n3. A very complete and diversified collection of minerals from the\r\ncountry of Saltzburg.\r\n\r\n4. Another of substances procured in England, such as fluates and\r\ncarbonates of lime from Derbyshire; pyrites, copper and lead ore,\r\nzinc, and tin from Cornwall.\r\n\r\n5. A collection of tin ore, cobalt, uranite, &c. from Saxony.\r\n\r\n6. A series of minerals from Simplon, St. Gothard, the Tyrol,\r\nTransylvania, as well as from Egypt and America. All these articles,\r\nwithout being striking from their size, and other accessory qualities\r\nto be remarked in costly specimens, incontestably present a rich fund\r\nof instruction to persons delirous of fathoming science, by\r\nmultiplying the points of view under which mineral productions may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of the mineralogical collection of the\r\n_Conseil des Mines_, which the superintendants will, no doubt, with\r\ntime and attention, bring to the highest degree of perfection. It is\r\nopen to the public every Monday and Thursday: but, on the other days\r\nof the week, amateurs and students have access to it.\r\n\r\nA few years before the revolution, France was still considered as\r\ndestitute of an infinite number of mineral riches, which were thought\r\nto belong exclusively to several of the surrounding countries.\r\nGermany was quoted as a country particularly favoured, in this\r\nrespect, by Nature. Yet France is crossed by mountains similar to\r\nthose met with in Germany, and these mountains contain rocks of the\r\nsame species as those of that country which is so rich in minerals.\r\nWhat has happened might therefore have been foreseen; namely, that,\r\nwhen intelligent men, with an experienced eye, should examine the\r\nsoil of the various departments of the Republic, they would find in\r\nit not only substances hitherto considered as scarce, but even\r\nseveral of those whose existence there had not yet been suspected.\r\nSince the revolution, the following are the\r\n\r\n_Principal Mineral Substances discovered in France._\r\n\r\n_Dolomite_ in the mountains of Vosges and in the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n_Carburet of iron_ or _plumbago_, in the south peak of Bigorre. The\r\nsame variety has been been found near Argentière, and the valley of\r\nChamouny, department of Mont-Blanc.\r\n\r\nA rock of the appearance of _porphyry_, with a _calcareous_ base, in\r\nthe same valley of Chamouny.\r\n\r\n_Tremolite_ or _grammatite_ of HAÜY, in the same place. These two\r\nlast-mentioned substances were in terminated crystals.\r\n\r\n_Red oxyd of titanium_, in the same place.\r\n\r\n_New violet schorl_, or _sphene_ of HAÜY, (_rayonnante en goutière_\r\nof SAUSSURE) in the same place.\r\n\r\n_Crystallized sulphate of strontia_, in the mines of Villefort in La\r\nLozère, in the environs of Paris, at Bartelemont, near the _Salterns_\r\nin the department of La Meurthe.\r\n\r\n_Fibrous and crystallized sulphate of strontia_, at Bouvron, near\r\nToul.\r\n\r\n_Earthy sulphate of strontia_, in the vicinity of Paris, near the\r\nforest of Montmorency, and to the north-east of it.\r\n\r\n_Onyx-agate-quartz_, at Champigny, in the department of La Seine.\r\n\r\n_Avanturine-quartz_, in the Deux-Sevres.\r\n\r\n_Marine bodies_, imbedded in the soil, a little above the _Oule de\r\nGavernie_.\r\n\r\n_Anthracite_, and its direction determined in several departments.\r\n\r\n_Other marine bodies_, at the height of upwards of 3400 _mètres_ or\r\n3683 yards, on the summit of Mont-Perdu, in the Upper Pyrenées.\r\n\r\n_Wolfram_, near St. Yriex, in Upper Vienne.\r\n\r\n_Oxyd of antimony_, at Allemont, in the department of L'Isère.\r\n\r\n_Chromate of iron_, near Gassin, in the department of _Le Var_, at\r\nthe _bastide_ of the cascade.\r\n\r\n_Oxyd of uranite_, at St. Simphorien de Marmagne, in the department\r\nof La Côte d'Or.\r\n\r\n_Acicular arsenical lead ore_, at St. Prix, in the department of\r\nSaone and Loire. This substance was found among some piles of\r\nrubbish, near old works made for exploring a vein of lead ore, which\r\nlies at the foot of a mountain to the north-east, and at three\r\nquarters of a league from the _commune_ of St. Prix.\r\n\r\nIn this country have likewise been found several varieties of new\r\ninteresting forms relative to substances already known; several\r\nimportant geological facts have been ascertained; and, lastly, the\r\nemerald has here been recently discovered. France already possesses\r\neighteen of the twenty-one metallic substances known. Few countries\r\ninherit from Nature the like advantages.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the administration of the mines of France, the\r\nunder-mentioned are the regulations now in force.\r\n\r\nA council composed of three members, is charged to give to the\r\nMinister of the Interior ideas, together with their motives,\r\nrespecting every thing that relates to mines. It corresponds, in the\r\nterms of the law, with all the grantees and with all persons who\r\nexplore mines, salterns, and quarries. It superintends the research\r\nand extraction of all substances drawn from the bosom of the earth,\r\nand their various management. It proposes the grants, permissions,\r\nand advances to be made, and the encouragements to be given. Under\r\nits direction are the two practical schools, and twenty-five\r\nengineers of mines, nine of whom are spread over different parts of\r\nthe French territory. General information relative to statistics,\r\nevery thing that can concur in the formation of the mineralogical map\r\nof France and complete the collection of her minerals, and all\r\nobservations and memoirs relative to the art of mines or of the\r\ndifferent branches of metallurgy, are addressed by the engineers to\r\nthe _Conseil des Mines_ at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 20, 1802_.\r\n\r\nHaving fully described to you all the theatres here of the first and\r\nsecond rank, I shall confine myself to a rapid sketch of those which\r\nmay be classed in the third order.[1]\r\n\r\nTHÉÂTRE MONTANSIER.\r\n\r\nThis house stands at the north-west angle of the _Palais du\r\nTribunat_. It is of an oval form, and contains three tiers of boxes,\r\nexclusively of a large amphitheatre. Before the revolution, it bore\r\nthe name of _Théâtre des Petits Comédiens du Comte de Beaujolais_,\r\nand was famous for the novelty of the spectacle here given. Young\r\ngirls and boys represented little comedies and comic operas in the\r\nfollowing manner. Some gesticulated on the stage; while others,\r\nplaced in the side-scenes, spoke or sang their parts without being\r\nseen. It was impossible to withhold one's admiration from the perfect\r\nharmony between the motions of the one and the speaking and singing\r\nof the other. In short, this double acting was executed with such\r\nprecision that few strangers detected the deception.\r\n\r\nTo these actors succeeded full-grown performers, who have since\r\ncontinued to play interludes of almost every description. Indeed,\r\nthis theatre is the receptacle of all the nonsense imaginable;\r\nnothing is too absurd or too low for its stage. Here are collected\r\nall the trivial expressions to be met with in this great city,\r\nwhether made use of in the markets, gaming-houses, taverns, or\r\ndancing-rooms.\r\n\r\nCAROLINE and BRUNET, or BRUNET and CAROLINE. They are like two\r\nplanets, round which move a great number of satellites, some more\r\nimperceptible than others. If to these we add TIERCELIN, an actor of\r\nthe grotesque species, little more is to be said. Were it not for\r\nBRUNET, who makes the most of his comic humour, in playing all sorts\r\nof low characters, and sometimes in a manner truly original, and\r\nMademoiselle CAROLINE, whose clear, flexible, and sonorous voice\r\ninsures the success of several little operas, the _Théâtre\r\nMontansier_ would not be able to maintain its ground, notwithstanding\r\nthe advantages of its centrical situation, and the attractions of its\r\nlobby, where the impures of the environs exhibit themselves to no\r\nsmall advantage, and literally carry all before them.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the theatres on the _Boulevard_, at the head of which\r\nis to be placed\r\n\r\nL'AMBIGU COMIQUE.\r\n\r\nThis little theatre is situated on the _Boulevard du Temple_, and, of\r\nall those of the third order, has most constantly enjoyed the favour\r\nof the public. Previously to the revolution, AUDINOT drew hither\r\ncrowded houses by the representation of comic operas and bad _drames_\r\nof a gigantic nature, called here _pantomimes dialoguées_. The\r\neffects of decoration and show were carried farther at this little\r\ntheatre than at any other. Ghosts, hobgoblins, and devils were, in\r\nthe sequel, introduced. All Paris ran to see them, till the women\r\nwere terrified, and the men disgusted.\r\n\r\nCORSE, the present manager, has of late added considerably to the\r\nattraction of the _Ambigu Comique_, by not only restoring it to what\r\nit was in the most brilliant days of AUDINOT, but by collecting all\r\nthe best actors and dancers of the _Boulevard_, and improving on the\r\nplan adopted by his predecessor. He has neglected nothing necessary\r\nfor the advantageous execution of the new pieces which he has\r\nproduced. The most attractive of these are _Victor_, _le Pélerin\r\nblanc_, _L'Homme à trois visages_, _Le Jugement de Salomon_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe best performers at this theatre are CORSE, the manager, TAUTIN,\r\nand Mademoiselle LEVESQUE.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn regard to all the other minor theatres, the enumeration of which I\r\nhave detailed to you in a preceding letter,[2] I shall briefly,\r\nobserve that the curiosity of a stranger may be satisfied in paying\r\neach of them a single visit. Some of these _petits spectacles_ are\r\nopen one day, shut the next, and soon after reopened with\r\nperformances of a different species. Therefore, to attempt a\r\ndescription of their attractions would probably be superfluous; and,\r\nindeed, the style of the pieces produced is varied according to the\r\nideas of the speculators, the taste of the managers, or the abilities\r\nof the performers, who, if not \"the best actors in the world,\" are\r\nready to play either \"tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral,\r\npastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem\r\nunlimited.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Theatre of the _Porte St. Martin_ not having been\r\nopen, when this letter was written, it is not here noticed. It may be\r\nconsidered as of the second rank. Its representations include almost\r\nevery line of acting; but those for which the greatest expense is\r\nincurred are melo-drames and pieces connected with pantomime and\r\nparade. The house is the same in which the grand French opera was\r\nperformed before the revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Vol. i. Letter XXI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 22, 1802._\r\n\r\nThe variety of matter which crowds itself on the mind of a man who\r\nattempts to describe this immense capital, forms such a chaos, that\r\nyou will, I trust, give me credit for the assertion, when I assure\r\nyou that it is not from neglect or inattention I sometimes take more\r\ntime than may appear strictly necessary to comply with your wishes.\r\nConsidering how deeply it involves the peace and comfort of\r\nstrangers, as well as inhabitants, I am not at all surprised at the\r\nanxiety which you express to acquire some knowledge of the\r\n\r\nPOLICE OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nIn the present existing circumstances, it might be imprudent, if not\r\ndangerous, to discuss, freely openly, so delicate a question. I shall\r\ntake a middle course. Silence would imply fear; while boldness of\r\nexpression might give offence; and though I certainly am not afraid\r\nto mention the subject, yet to offend, is by no means my wish or\r\nintention. In this country, the Post-Office has often been the\r\nchannel through which the opinion of individuals has been collected.\r\nWhat has been, may again occur; and in such critical times, who\r\nknows, but the government may conceive itself justified in not\r\nconsidering as absolutely sacred the letters intrusted to that mode\r\nof conveyance? Under these considerations, I shall beg leave to refer\r\nyou to a work which has gone through the hands of every inquisitive\r\nreader; that is the _Tableau de Paris_, published in 1788: but, on\r\nrecollection, as this letter will, probably, find you in the country,\r\nwhere you may not have an immediate opportunity of gratifying your\r\ncuriosity, and as the book is become scarce, I shall select from it\r\nfor your satisfaction a few extracts concerning the Police.\r\n\r\nThis establishment is necessary and useful for maintaining order and\r\ntranquillity in a city like Paris, where the very extremes of luxury\r\nand wretchedness are continually in collision. I mean _useful_, when\r\nno abuse is made of its power; and it is to be hoped that the present\r\ngovernment of France is too wise and too just to convert an\r\ninstitution of public utility into an instrument of private\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nSince the machinery of the police was first put in order by M.\r\nD'ARGENSON, in 1697, its wheels and springs have been continually\r\nmultiplied by the thirteen ministers who succeeded him in that\r\ndepartment. The last of these was the celebrated M. LENOIR.\r\n\r\nThe present Minister of the Police, M. FOUCHÉ, has, it seems,\r\nadopted, in a great measure, the means put in practice before the\r\nrevolution. His administration, according to general report, bears\r\nmost resemblance to that of M. LENOIR: he is said, however, to have\r\nimproved on that vigilant magistrate: but he surpasses him, I am\r\ntold, more in augmentation of expenses and agents, than in real\r\nchanges.[1]\r\n\r\nIn selecting from the before-mentioned work the following _widely\r\nscattered_ passages, and assembling them as a _piece of Mosaic_, it\r\nhas been my endeavour to enable you to form an impartial judgment of\r\nthe police of Paris, by exhibiting it with all its perfections and\r\nimperfections. Borrowing the language of MERCIER, I shall trace the\r\ninstitution through all its ramifications, and, in pointing out its\r\neffects, I shall \"nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.\"\r\n\r\nIf we take it for granted, that the police of Paris is now exercised\r\non the same plan as that pursued towards the close of the old\r\n_régime_, this sketch will be the more interesting, as its\r\nresemblance to the original will exempt me from adding a single\r\nstroke from my own pencil.\r\n\r\n\"D'ARGENSON was severe,\" says MERCIER, \"perhaps because he felt, in\r\nfirst setting the machine in motion, a resistance which his\r\nsuccessors have less experienced. For a long time it was imagined\r\nthat a Minister of Police ought to be harsh; he ought to be firm\r\nonly. Several of these magistrates have laid on too heavy a hand,\r\nbecause they were not acquainted with the people of Paris; a people\r\nof quick feeling, but not ferocious[2], whose motions are to be\r\ndivined, and consequently easy to be led. Whoever should be void of\r\npity in that post, would be a monster.\"\r\n\r\nMERCIER then gives the fragment by FONTENELLE, on the police of Paris\r\nand on M. D'ARGENSON, of which I shall select only what may be\r\nnecessary for elucidating the main subject.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of a well-governed city,\" says FONTENELLE, \"enjoy\r\nthe good order which is there established, without considering what\r\ntrouble it costs those who establish or preserve it, much in the same\r\nmanner as all mankind enjoy the regularity of the motions of\r\ncelestial bodies, without having any knowledge of them, and even the\r\nmore the good order of a police resembles by its uniformity that of\r\nthe celestial bodies, the more is it imperceptible, and,\r\nconsequently, the more it is unknown, the greater is its perfection.\r\nBut he who would wish to know it and fathom it, would be terrified.\r\nTo keep up perpetually in a city, like Paris, an immense consumption,\r\nsome sources of which may always be dried up by a variety of\r\naccidents; to repress the tyranny of shop-keepers in regard to the\r\npublic, and at the same time animate their commerce; to prevent the\r\nmutual usurpations of the one over the other, often difficult to\r\ndiscriminate; to distinguish in a vast crowd all those who may easily\r\nconceal there a hurtful industry; to purge society of them, or\r\ntolerate them only as far as they can be useful to it by employments\r\nwhich no others but themselves would undertake, or discharge so well;\r\nto keep necessary abuses within the precise limits of necessity which\r\nthey are always ready to over-leap; to envelop them in the obscurity\r\nto which they ought to be condemned, and not even draw them from it\r\nby chastisement too notorious; to be ignorant of what it is better to\r\nbe ignorant of than to punish, and to punish but seldom and usefully;\r\nto penetrate by subterraneous avenues into the bosom of families, and\r\nkeep for them the secrets which they have not confided, as long as it\r\nis not necessary to make use of them; to be present every where\r\nwithout being seen; in short, to move or stop at pleasure an immense\r\nmultitude, and be the soul ever-acting, and almost unknown, of this\r\ngreat body: these are, in general, the functions of the chief\r\nmagistrate of the police. It should seem that one man alone could not\r\nbe equal to them, either on account of the quantity of things of\r\nwhich he must be informed, or of that of the views which he must\r\nfollow, or of the application which he must exert, or of the variety\r\nof conduct which he most observe, and of the characters which he must\r\nassume: but the public voice will answer whether M. D'ARGENSON has\r\nbeen equal to them.\r\n\r\n\"Under him, cleanliness, tranquillity, plenty, and safety were\r\nbrought to the highest degree of perfection in this city. And,\r\nindeed, the late king (Lewis XIV) relied entirely on his care\r\nrespecting Paris. He could have given an account of a person unknown\r\nwho should have stolen into it in the dark; this person, whatever\r\ningenuity he exerted in concealing himself, was always under his eye;\r\nand if, at last, any one escaped him, at least what produced almost\r\nthe same effect, no one would have dared to think himself\r\nwell-concealed.\r\n\r\n\"Surrounded and overwhelmed in his audiences by a crowd of people\r\nchiefly of the lower class, little informed themselves of what\r\nbrought them, warmly agitated by interests very trifling, and\r\nfrequently very ill understood, accustomed to supply the place of\r\ndiscourse by senseless clamour, he neither betrayed the inattention\r\nnor the disdain which such persons or such subjects might have\r\noccasioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"FONTENELLE has not,\" continues MERCIER, \"spoken of the severity of\r\nM. D'ARGENSON, of his inclination to punish, which was rather a sign\r\nof weakness than of strength. Alas! human laws, imperfect and rude,\r\ncannot dive to the bottom of the human heart, and there discover the\r\ncauses of the delinquencies which they have to punish! They judge\r\nonly from the surface: they would acquit, perhaps, those whom they\r\ncondemn; they would strike him whom they suffer to escape. But they\r\ncannot, I confess, do otherwise. Nevertheless, they ought to neglect\r\nnothing that serves to disclose the heart of man. They ought to\r\nestimate the strength of natural and indestructible passions, not in\r\ntheir effects, but in their principles; to pay attention to the age,\r\nthe sex, the time, the day; these are nice rules, which could not be\r\nfound in the brain of the legislator, but which ought to be met with\r\nin that of a Minister of the Police.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are also epidemical errors in which the multitude of those who\r\ngo astray, seems to lessen the fault; in which a sort of\r\ncircumspection is necessary, in order that punishment may not be in\r\nopposition to public interest, because punishment would then appear\r\nabsurd or barbarous, and indignation might recoil on the law, as well\r\nas on the magistrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a life has a Minister of Police! He has not a moment that he\r\ncan call his own; he is every day obliged to punish; he is afraid to\r\ngive way to indulgence, because he does not know that he may not one\r\nday have to reproach himself with it. He is under the necessity of\r\nbeing severe, and of acting contrary to the inclination of his heart;\r\nnot a crime is committed but he receives the shameful or cruel\r\naccount: he hears of nothing but vicious men and vices; every instant\r\nhe is told: 'there's a murder! a suicide! a rape!' Not an accident\r\nhappens but he must prescribe the remedy, and hastily; he has but a\r\nmoment to deliberate and act, and he must be equally fearful to abuse\r\nthe power intrusted to him, and not to use it opportunely. Popular\r\nrumours, flighty conversations, theatrical factions, false alarms,\r\nevery thing concerns him.\r\n\r\n\"Is he gone to rest? A fire rouses him from his bed. He must be\r\nanswerable for every thing; he must trace the robber, and the lurking\r\nassassin who has committed a crime; for the magistrate appears\r\nblameable, if he has not found means to deliver him up quickly to\r\njustice. The time that his agents have employed in this capture will\r\nbe calculated, and his honour requires that the interval between the\r\ncrime and the imprisonment should be the shortest possible. What\r\ndreadful duties! What a laborious life! And yet this place is\r\ncoveted!\r\n\r\n\"On some occasions, it is necessary for the Minister of Police to\r\ndemean himself like a true _Greek_, as was the case in the following\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n\"A person, being on the point of making a journey, had in his\r\npossession a sum of twenty thousand livres which embarrassed him; he\r\nhad only one servant, whom he mistrusted, and the sum was tempting.\r\nHe accordingly requested a friend to be so obliging as to take care\r\nof it for him till his return.\r\n\r\n\"A fortnight after, the friend denied the circumstance. As there was\r\nno proof, the civil law could not pronounce in this affair. Recourse\r\nwas had to the Minister of Police, who pondered a moment, and sent\r\nfor the receiver, making the accuser retire into an adjoining room:\r\n\r\n\"The friend arrives, and maintains that he has not received the\r\ntwenty thousand livres. 'Well,' said the magistrate, 'I believe you;\r\nand as you are innocent you run no, risk in writing to your wife the\r\nnote that I am going to dictate. Write.\r\n\r\n\"'\"My dear wife, all is discovered. I shall be punished if I do not\r\nrestore you know what. Bring the sum: your coming quickly to my\r\nrelief is the only way for me to get out of trouble and obtain my\r\npardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"'This note,' added the magistrate, 'will fully justify you. Your\r\nwife can bring nothing since you have received nothing, and your\r\naccuser will be foiled.'\r\n\r\n\"The note was dispatched; the wife, terrified, ran with the twenty\r\nthousand livres.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the Minister of Police can daily make up for the imperfection\r\nand tardiness of our civil laws; but he ought to use this rare and\r\nsplendid privilege with extreme circumspection.\r\n\r\n\"The chief magistrate of the police is become a minister of\r\nimportance; he has a secret and prodigious influence; he knows so\r\nmany things, that he can do much mischief or much good, because he\r\nhas in hand a multitude of threads which he can entangle or\r\ndisentangle at his pleasure; he strikes or he saves; he spreads\r\ndarkness or light: his authority is as delicate as it is extensive.\r\n\r\n\"The Minister of Police exercises a despotic sway over the\r\n_mouchards_ who are found disobedient, or who make false reports: as\r\nfor these fellows, they are of a class so vile and so base, that the\r\nauthority to which they have sold themselves, has necessarily an\r\nabsolute right over their persons.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the case with those who are apprehended in the name of\r\nthe police; they may have committed trifling faults: they may have\r\nenemies in that crowd of _exempts_, spies, and satellites, who are\r\nbelieved on their word. The eye of the magistrate may be incessantly\r\ndeceived, and the punishment of these crimes ought to be submitted to\r\na more deliberate investigation; but the house of correction ingulfs\r\na vast number of men who there become still more perverted, and who,\r\non coming out, are still more wicked than when they went in. Being\r\ndegraded in their own eyes, they afterwards plunge themselves\r\nheadlong into all sorts of irregularities.\r\n\r\n\"These different imprisonments are sometimes rendered necessary by\r\nimperious circumstances; yet it were always to be wished that the\r\ndetention of a citizen should not depend on a single magistrate, but\r\nthat there should be a sort of tribunal to examine when this great\r\nact of authority, withdrawn from the eye of the law, ceases to be\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\n\"A few real advantages compensate for these irregular forms, and\r\nthere are, in fact, an infinite number of irregularities which the\r\nslow and grave process of our tribunals can neither take cognizance\r\nof, nor put a stop to, nor foresee, nor punish. The audacious or\r\nsubtle delinquent would triumph in the winding labyrinth of our civil\r\nlaws. The laws of the police, more direct, watch him, press him, and\r\nsurround him mose closely. The abuse, is contiguous to the benefit, I\r\nadmit; but a great many private acts of violence, base and shameful\r\ncrimes, are repressed by this vigilant and active force which ought,\r\nnevertheless, to publish its code and submit it to the inspection of\r\nenlightened citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could the Minister of Police communicate to the philosopher all he\r\nknows, all he learns, all he sees, and likewise impart to him certain\r\nsecret things, of which he alone is well-informed, there would be\r\nnothing so curious and so instructive under the pen of the\r\nphilosopher; for he would astonish all his brethren. But this\r\nmagistrate is like the great penitentiary; he hears every thing,\r\nrelates nothing, and is not astonished at certain delinquencies in\r\nthe same degree as another man. By dint of seeing the tricks of\r\nroguery, the crimes of vice, secret treachery, and all the filth of\r\nhuman actions, he has necessarily a little difficulty in giving\r\ncredit to the integrity and virtue of honest people. He is in a\r\nperpetual state of mistrust; and, in the main, he ought to possess\r\nsuch a character; for, he ought to think nothing impossible, after\r\nthe extraordinary lessons which he receives from men and from things.\r\nIn a word, his place commands a continual, and scrutinizing\r\nsuspicion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_February 22, in continuation._\r\n\r\n\"Even should not the Parisian have the levity with which he is\r\nreproached, reason would justify him in its adoption. He walks\r\nsurrounded by spies. No sooner do two citizens whisper to each other,\r\nthan up comes a third, who prowls about in order to listen to what\r\nthey are saying. The spies of the police are a regiment of\r\ninquisitive fellows; with this difference, that each individual\r\nbelonging to this regiment has a distinct dress, which he changes\r\nfrequently every day; and nothing so quick or so astonishing, as\r\nthese sorts of metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n\"The same spy who figures as a private gentleman in the morning, in\r\nthe evening represents a priest: at one time, he is a peaceable limb\r\nof the law; at another, a swaggering bully. The next day, with a\r\ngold-headed cane in his hand, he will assume the deportment of a\r\nmonied man buried in calculations; the most singular disguises are\r\nquite familiar to him. In the course of the twenty-four hours, he is\r\nan officer of distinction and a journeyman hair-dresser, a shorn\r\napostle and a scullion. He visits the dress-ball and the lowest sink\r\nof vice. At one time with a diamond ring on his finger, at another\r\nwith the most filthy wig on his head, he almost changes his\r\ncountenance as he does his apparel; and more than one of these\r\n_mouchards_ would teach the French _Roscius_ the art of _decomposing_\r\nhimself; he is all eyes, all ears, all legs; for he trots, I know not\r\nhow, over the pavement of every quarter of the town. Squatted\r\nsometimes in the corner of a coffee-room, you would take him for a\r\ndull, stupid, tiresome fellow, snoring till supper is ready: he has\r\nseen and heard all that has passed. At another time, he is an orator,\r\nand been the first to make a bold speech; he courts you to open your\r\nmind; he interprets even your silence, and whether you speak to him\r\nor not, he knows what you think of this or that proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the universal instrument employed in Paris for diving into\r\nsecrets; and this is what determines the actions of persons in power\r\nmore willingly than any thing that could be imagined in reasoning or\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\"The employment of spies has destroyed the ties of confidence and\r\nfriendship. None but frivolous questions are agitated, and the\r\ngovernment dictates, as it were, to citizens the subject on which\r\nthey shall speak in the evening in coffee-houses, as well as in\r\nprivate circles.\r\n\r\n\"The people have absolutely lost every idea of civil or political\r\nadministration; and if any thing could excite laughter in the midst\r\nof an ignorance so deplorable, it would be the conversation of such a\r\nsilly fellow who constantly imagines that Paris must give the law and\r\nthe _ton_ to all Europe, and thence to all the world.\r\n\r\n\"The men belonging to the police are a mass of corruption which the\r\nMinister of that department divides into two parts: of the one, he\r\nmakes spies or _mouchards_; of the other, satellites, _exempts_, that\r\nis, officers, whom he afterwards lets loose against pickpockets,\r\nswindlers, thieves, &c., much in the same manner as a huntsman sets\r\nhounds on wolves and foxes.\r\n\r\n\"The spies have other spies at their heels, who watch over them, and\r\nsee that they do their duty. They all accuse each other reciprocally,\r\nand worry one another for the vilest gain.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot here avoid interrupting my copious but laboriously-gathered\r\nselection from MERCIER, to relate an anecdote which shews in what a\r\ndetestable light _mouchards_ are considered in Paris.\r\n\r\nA man who appeared to be in tolerably good circumstances, fell in\r\nlove, and married a girl whom the death of her parents and\r\naccumulated distress had driven to a life of dissipation. At the end\r\nof a few months, she learnt that her husband was a spy of the police.\r\n\"Probably,\" said, she to him, \"you did not take up this trade till\r\nafter you had reflected that in following that of a thief or a\r\nmurderer, you would have risked your life.\" On saying this, she ran\r\nout of the house, and precipitated herself from the _Pont Royal_ into\r\nthe Seine, where she was drowned.--But to resume the observations of\r\nMERCIER.\r\n\r\n\"It is from these odious dregs,\" continues our author, \"that public\r\norder arises.\r\n\r\n\"When the _mouchards_ of the police have acted contrary to their\r\ninstructions, they are confined in the house of correction; but they\r\nare separated from the other prisoners, because they would be torn to\r\npieces by those whom they have caused to be imprisoned, and who would\r\nrecognize them. They inspire less pity on account of the vile trade\r\nwhich they follow. One sees with surprise, and with still more pain,\r\nthat these fellows are very young. Spies, informers at sixteen!--O!\r\nwhat a shocking life does this announce!\" exclaims MERCIER. \"No;\r\nnothing ever distressed me more than to see boys act such a part....\r\nAnd those who form them into squads, who drill them, who corrupt such\r\ninexperienced youth!\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the admirable order which reigns in Paris, that a man\r\nsuspected or described is watched so closely, that his smallest steps\r\nare known, till the very moment when it is expedient to apprehend\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The description taken of the man is a real portrait, which it is\r\nimpossible to mistake; and the art of thus describing the person by\r\nwords, is carried to so great a nicety, that the best writer, after\r\nmuch reflection on the matter, could add nothing to it, nor make use\r\nof other expressions.\r\n\r\n\"The Theseuses of the police are on foot every night to purge the\r\ncity of robbers, and it might be said that the lions, bears, and\r\ntigers are chained by political order.\r\n\r\n\"There are also the court-spies, the town-spies, the bed-spies, the\r\nstreet-spies, the spies of impures, and the spies of wits: they are\r\nall called by the name of _mouchards_, the family name of the first\r\nspy employed by the court of France.\r\n\r\n\"Men of fashion at this day follow the trade of _mouchards_; most of\r\nthem style themselves _Monsieur le Baron_, _Monsieur le Comte_,\r\n_Monsieur le Marquis_. There was a time, under Lewis XV, when spies\r\nwere so numerous, that it was impossible for friends, who assembled\r\ntogether, to open their heart to each other concerning matters which\r\ndeeply affected their interest. The ministerial inquisition had\r\nposted its sentinels at the door of every room, and listeners in\r\nevery closet. Ingenuous confidences, made from friends to friends,\r\nand intended to die in the very bosom where they had been deposited,\r\nwere punished as dangerous conspiracies.\r\n\r\n\"These odious researches poisoned social life, deprived men of\r\npleasures the most innocent, and transformed citizens into enemies\r\nwho trembled to unbosom themselves to each other.\r\n\r\n\"One fourth of the servants in Paris serve as spies; and the secrets\r\nof families, which are thought the most concealed, come to the\r\nknowledge of those interested in being acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n\"Independently of the spies of the police, ministers have spies\r\nbelonging to themselves, and keep them in pay: these are the most\r\ndangerous of all, because they are less suspected than others, and it\r\nis more difficult to know them. By these means, ministers know what\r\nis said of them; yet, of this they avail themselves but little. They\r\nare more intent to ruin their enemies, and thwart their adversaries,\r\nthan to derive a prudent advantage from the free and ingenuous hints\r\ngiven them by the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"It is entertaining enough to consider that, in proper time and\r\nplace, spies are watching him who, at his pleasure, sets spies to\r\nwatch other citizens. Thus, the links which connect mankind in\r\npolitical order are really incomprehensible. He who does not admire\r\nthe manner in which society exists, and is supported by the\r\nsimultaneous reaction of its members, and who sees not the serpent's\r\n_tail_ entering its _mouth_, is not born for reflection.\r\n\r\n\"But the secrets of courts are not revealed through spies; they get\r\nwind by means of certain people who are not in the least mistrusted;\r\nin like manner the best built ships leak through an imperceptible\r\nchink, which cannot be discovered.\r\n\r\n\"What is interesting in courts, and particularly so in ours,\" says\r\nMERCIER, \"is that there is a degree of obscurity spread over all its\r\nproceedings. We wish to penetrate what is concealed, we endeavour to\r\nknow till we learn; thus it is that the most ingenious machine\r\npreserves its highest value only till we have seen the springs which\r\nset it in motion.\r\n\r\n\"After having considered the different parts which form the police of\r\nthe capital, we still perceive all the radii reaching from the centre\r\nto the circumference. How many ramifications issue from the same\r\nstem! How far the branches extend! What an impulse does not Paris\r\ngive to other neighbouring cities!\r\n\r\n\"The police of Paris has an intimate correspondence with that of\r\nLyons and other provincial cities: for it is evident that it would be\r\nimperfect, if it could not follow the disturber of public order, and\r\nif the distance of a few leagues skreened him from researches.\r\n\r\n\"The correspondence of the Parisian police is not therefore limited\r\nto its walls; it extends much farther; and it is in towns where\r\nimprudent or rash persons would imagine that they might give their\r\ntongue greater freedom, that the vigilant magistrate pries into\r\nconversation, and keeps a watchful eye over those who would measure\r\ntheir audacity by the degree of distance from the capital.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the police of Paris, after having embraced France, penetrates\r\nalso into Switzerland, Italy, Holland, and Germany;[3] and when\r\noccasion requires, its eye is open on all sides to what can interest\r\nthe government. When it wishes to know any fact, it is informed of it\r\nto a certainty; when it wishes to strike a serious blow, it seldom\r\nmisses its aim.\r\n\r\n\"It may easily be conceived that the machine would be incomplete, and\r\nthat its play would fail in the desired effect, did it not embrace a\r\ncertain extent. It costs but little to give to the lever the\r\nnecessary length. Whether the spy be kept in pay at Paris, or a\r\nhundred leagues off, the expense is the same, and the utility becomes\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n\"Experience has shewn that these observations admit of essential\r\ndifferences in the branches of the police. Weights and measures must\r\nbe changed, according to time, place, persons, and circumstances.\r\nThere are no fixed rules; they must be created at the instant, and\r\nthe most versatile actions are not destitute of wisdom and reason.\r\n\r\n\"Of this wholesale legislators are not aware: it is reserved for\r\npractitioners to seize these shades of distinction. There must be a\r\ncustomary, and, as it were, every-day policy, in order to decide well\r\nwithout precipitation, without weakness, and without rigour. What\r\nwould be a serious fault at Paris, would be a simple imprudence at\r\nLyons, an indifferent thing elsewhere, and so on reciprocally.\r\n\r\n\"Now this science has not only its details and its niceties, it has\r\nalso its variations, and sometimes even its oppositions. Ministers\r\nmust have a steady eye and great local experience, in order to be\r\nable to strike true, and strike opportunely, without espousing\r\nimaginary terrors; which, in matters of police, is the greatest fault\r\nthat can be committed.[4]\r\n\r\n\"LYCURGUS, SOLON, LOCKE, and PENN! you have made very fine and\r\nmajestic laws; but would you have divined these? Although secret,\r\nthey exist; they have their wisdom, and even their depth. The\r\ndistance of a few leagues gives to matters of police two colours,\r\nwhich bear to each other no resemblance; and there is no principal\r\ntown which is not obliged, in modeling its police on that of Paris,\r\nto introduce into it the greatest modifications. The motto of every\r\nMinister of Police ought to be this: _The letter of the law kills,\r\nits spirit gives life._\r\n\r\n\"The safety of Paris, during the night, is owing to the guard[5] and\r\ntwo or three hundred _mouchards_, who trot about the streets, and\r\nrecognize and follow suspected persons. It is chiefly by night that\r\nthe police makes its captions.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these captions are made is humorously, gravely,\r\nfeelingly, and philosophically described by the ingenious MERCIER.\r\nLong as this letter already is, I am confident that you will not\r\nregret its being still lengthened by another extract or two relative\r\nto this interesting point; thus I shall terminate the only\r\nelucidation that you are likely to obtain on a subject which has so\r\nstrongly excited your curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"The comic,\" says our lively author, \"is here blended with the\r\nserious. The fulminating order, which is going to crush you, is in\r\nthe pocket of the _exempt_, who feels a degree of pleasure in the\r\nexercise of his dreadful functions. He enjoys a secret pride in being\r\nbearer of the thunder; he fancies himself the eagle of Jove: but his\r\nmotion is like that of a serpent. He glides along, dodges you,\r\ncrouches before you, approaches your ear, and with down-cast eyes and\r\na soft-toned voice, says to you, at the same time shrugging his\r\nshoulders: '_Je suis au désespoir, Monsieur; mais j'ai un ordre,\r\nMonsieur, qui vous arrête, Monsieur; de la part de la police,\r\nMonsieur_.'----'_Moi, Monsieur_?'----'_Vous-même, Monsieur_.'----You\r\nwaver an instant between anger and indignation, ready to vent all\r\nsorts of imprecations. You see only a polite, respectful, well-bred\r\nman, bowing to you, mild in his speech, and civil in his manners.\r\nWere you the most furious of mankind, your wrath would be instantly\r\ndisarmed. Had you pistols, you would discharge them in the air, and\r\nnever against the affable _exempt_. Presently you return him his\r\nbows: there even arises between you a contest of politeness and good\r\nbreeding. It is a reciprocity of obliging words and compliments, till\r\nthe moment when the resounding bolts separate you from the polite\r\nman, who goes to make a report of his mission, and whose employment,\r\nby no means an unprofitable one, is to imprison people with all\r\npossible gentleness, urbanity, and grace.\r\n\r\n\"I am walking quietly in the street; before me is a young man\r\ndecently dressed. All at once four fellows seize on him, collar him,\r\npush him against the wall, and drag him away. Natural instinct\r\ncommands me to go to his assistance; a tranquil witness says to me\r\ncoolly: 'Don't interfere; 'tis nothing, sir, but a caption made by\r\nthe police.' The young man is handcuffed, and he disappears.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to enter a narrow street, a man belonging to the guard is\r\nposted there as a sentinel: I perceive several of the populace\r\nlooking out of the windows. 'What's the matter, sir?' say I.----\r\n'Nothing,' replies he; 'they are only taking up thirty girls of the\r\ntown at one cast of the net.' Presently the girls, with top-knots of\r\nall colours, file off, led by the soldiers of the guard, who lead\r\nthem gallantly by the hand, with their muskets clubbed.\r\n\r\n\"It is eleven o'clock at night, or five in the morning, there is a\r\nknock at your door; your servant opens it; in a moment your room is\r\nfilled with a squad of satellites. The order is precise, resistance\r\nis vain; every thing that might serve as a weapon is put out of your\r\nreach; and the _exempt_, who will not, on that account, boast the\r\nless of his bravery even takes your brass pocket-inkstand for a\r\npistol.\r\n\r\n\"The next day, a neighbour, who has heard a noise in the house, asks\r\nwhat it might be: 'Nothing, 'tis only a man taken up by the police.'\r\n----'What has he done?'----'No one can tell; he has, perhaps,\r\ncommitted a murder, or sold a suspicious pamphlet.'----'But, sir,\r\nthere's some difference between those two crimes.'----'May be so; but\r\nhe is carried off.'\r\n\r\n\"You have been apprehended; but you have not been shewn the order;\r\nyou have been put into a carriage closely shut up; you know not\r\nwhither you are going to be taken; but you may be certain that you\r\nwill visit the wards or dungeons of some prison.\r\n\r\n\"Whence proceeds the decree of proscription? You cannot rightly\r\nguess.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary to write a thick volume against arbitrary\r\narrests. When one has said, _it is an arbitrary act_, one may,\r\nwithout any difficulty, infer every possible consequence. But all\r\ncaptions are not equally unjust: there are a multitude of secret and\r\ndangerous crimes which it would be impossible for the ordinary course\r\nof the law to take cognizance of, to put a stop to, and punish. When\r\nthe minister is neither seduced nor deceived, when he yields not to\r\nprivate passion, to blind prepossession, to misplaced severity, his\r\nobject is frequently to get rid of a disturber of the public peace;\r\nand the police, in the manner in which the machine is set up, could\r\nnot proceed, at the present day, without this quick, active, and\r\nrepressive power.\r\n\r\n\"It were only to be wished that there should be afterwards a\r\nparticular tribunal, which should weigh in an exact scale the motives\r\nof each caption, in order that imprudence and guilt, the pen and the\r\nponiard, the book and the libel, might not be confounded.\r\n\r\n\"The inspectors of police determine on their part a great many\r\nsubaltern captions; as they are generally believed on their word, and\r\nas they strike only the lowest class of the people, the chief readily\r\nconcedes to them the details of this authority.\r\n\r\n\"Some yield to their peevishness; others, to their caprice: but who\r\nknows whether avarice has not also a share in their proceedings, and\r\nwhether they do not often favour him who pays at the expense of him\r\nwho does not pay? Thus the liberty of the distressed and lowest\r\ncitizens would have a tarif; and this strange tax would bear hard on\r\nthe very numerous portion of _prostitutes_, _professed gamblers_,\r\n_quacks_, _hawkers_, _swindlers_, and _adventurers_, all people who\r\ndo mischief, and whom it is necessary to punish; but who do more\r\nmischief when they are obliged to pay, and purchase, during a certain\r\ntime, the privilege of their irregularities.\r\n\r\n\"We have imitated from the English their Vauxhall, their Ranelagh,\r\ntheir whist, their punch, their hats, their horse-races, their\r\njockies, their betting; but,\" concludes MERCIER, \"when shall we copy\r\nfrom them something more important, for instance, that bulwark of\r\nliberty, the law of _habeas corpus_?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The office of Minister of the Police has since been\r\nabolished. M. FOUCHÉ is now a Senator, and the machine of which he\r\nwas said to be so expert a manager, is confided to the direction of\r\nthe Prefect of Police, who exercises his functions under the\r\nimmediate authority of the Ministers, and corresponds with them\r\nconcerning matters which relate to their respective departments. The\r\nhigher duties of the Police are at present vested in the _Grand\r\nJuge_, who is also Minister of Justice. The former office is of\r\nrecent creation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Voltaire thought otherwise; and he was not mistaken.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I shall exemplify this truth by two remarkable facts.\r\nAbout the year 1775, when M. DE SARTINE was Minister of the Police,\r\nseveral forgeries were committed on the Bank of Vienna; Count DE\r\nMERCY, then Austrian ambassador at Paris, was directed to make a\r\nformal application for the delinquent to be delivered up to justice.\r\nWhat was his astonishment on receiving, a few hours after, a note\r\nfrom M. DE SARTINE, informing him that the author of the said\r\nforgeries had never been in Paris; but resided in Vienna, at the same\r\ntime mentioning the street, the number of the house, and other\r\ninteresting particulars!\r\n\r\nA circumstance which occurred in 1796, proves that, since the\r\nrevolution, the system of the Parisian police continues to extend to\r\nforeign countries. The English Commissary for prisoners of war was\r\nrequested by a friend to make inquiry, on his arrival in Paris,\r\nwhether a French lady of the name of BEAUFORT was living, and in what\r\npart of France she resided. He did so; and the following day, the\r\ncard, on which he had written the lady's name, was returned to him,\r\nwith this addition: \"She lives at No. 47, East-street,\r\nManchester-square, London.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The same principle holds good in politics.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The municipal guard of Paris at present consists of 2334\r\nmen. The privates must be above 30 and under 45 years of age.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 26, 1802._\r\n\r\nReferring to an expression made use of in my letter of the 16th of\r\nDecember last,[1] you ask me \"What the sciences, or rather the\r\n_savans_ or men of science, have done for this people?\" With the\r\nassistance of a young Professor in the _Collège de France_, who bids\r\nfair to eclipse all his competitors, it will not be difficult for me\r\nto answer your question.\r\n\r\nLet me premise, however, that the _savans_ to whom I allude, must not\r\nbe confounded with the philosophers, called _Encyclopædists_, from\r\ntheir having been the first to conceive and execute the plan of the\r\n_Encyclopædia_. These _savans_ were DIDEROT, D'ALEMBERT, and\r\nVOLTAIRE, all professed atheists, who, by the dissemination of their\r\npernicious doctrine, introduced into France an absolute contempt for\r\nall religion. This infidelity, dissolving every social tie, every\r\nprinciple between man and man, between the governing and the\r\ngoverned, in the sequel, produced anarchy, rapine, and all their\r\nattendant horrors.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the revolution, every mind being turned towards\r\npolitics, the Sciences were suddenly abandoned: they could have no\r\nweight in the struggle which then occupied every imagination.\r\nPresently their existence was completely forgotten. Liberty formed\r\nthe subject of every writing and every discourse: it seemed that\r\norators alone possessed the power of serving her; and this error was\r\npartly the cause of the calamities which afterwards overwhelmed\r\nFrance. The greater part of the _savans_ remained simple spectators\r\nof the events which were preparing: not one of them openly took part\r\nagainst the revolution. Some involved themselves in it. Those men\r\nwere urged by great views, and hoped to find, in the renewal of\r\nsocial organization, a mean of applying and realizing their theories.\r\nThey thought to master the revolution, and were carried away by its\r\ntorrent; but at that time the most sanguine hopes were indulged. If\r\nthe love of liberty be no more than a phantom of the brain, if the\r\nwish to render men better and happier be no more than a matter of\r\ndoubt, such errors may be pardoned in those who have paid for them\r\nwith their life.\r\n\r\nIt is in the recollection of every one that the National Convention\r\nconsisted of two parties, which, under the same exterior, were\r\nhastening to contrary ends: the one, composed of ignorant and\r\nferocious men, ruled by force; the other, more enlightened,\r\nmaintained its ground by address. The former, restless possessors of\r\nabsolute power, and determined to grasp at every thing for preserving\r\nit, strove to annihilate the talents and knowledge which made them\r\nsensible of their humiliating inferiority. The others, holding the\r\nsame language, acted in an opposite direction. But being obliged, in\r\norder to preserve their influence, never to shew themselves openly,\r\nthey employed their means with an extreme reserve, and this\r\nsimilarity at once explains the good they did, the evil they\r\nprevented, and the calamities which they were unable to avert.\r\n\r\nAt that time, France was on the very brink of ruin. _Landrecies_, _Le\r\nQuesnoy_, _Condé_ and _Valenciennes_ were in the power of her\r\nenemies. _Toulon_ had been given up to the English, whose numerous\r\nfleets held the dominion of the seas, and occasionally effected\r\ndebarkations. This country was a prey to famine and terror; _La\r\nVendée_, _Lyons_, and _Marseilles_ were in a state of insurrection.\r\nNo arms, no powder; no ally that could or would furnish any; and its\r\nonly resource lay in an anarchical government without either plan or\r\nmeans of defence, and skilful only in persecution. In a word, every\r\nthing announced that the Republic would perish, before it could enjoy\r\na year's existence.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity, two new members were called to the Committee of\r\nPublic Welfare. These two men organized the armies, conceived plans\r\nof campaign, and prepared supplies.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to arm nine hundred thousand men; and what was most\r\ndifficult, it was necessary to persuade a mistrustful people, ever\r\nready to cry out \"treason!\" of the possibility of such a prodigy. For\r\nthis purpose, the old manufactories were comparatively nothing;\r\nseveral of them, situated on the frontiers, were invaded by the\r\nenemy. They were revived every where with an activity till then\r\nunexampled. _Savans_ or men of science were charged to describe and\r\nsimplify the necessary proceedings. The melting of the church-bells\r\nyielded all the necessary metal.[2] Steel was wanting; none could be\r\nobtained from abroad, the art of making it was unknown. The _Savans_\r\nwere asked to create it; they succeeded, and this part of the public\r\ndefence thus became independent of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of the war had rendered more glaring the urgent\r\nnecessity of having good topographical maps, and the insufficiency of\r\nthose in use became every day more evident. The geographical\r\nengineers, which corps had been suppressed by the Constituent\r\nAssembly, were recalled to the armies, and although they could not,\r\nin these first moments, give to their labours the necessary extent\r\nand detail, they nevertheless paved the way to the great results\r\nsince obtained in this branch of the art military. Nothing is more\r\neasy than to destroy; nothing is so difficult, and, above all, so\r\ntedious as to reconstruct.\r\n\r\nThe persons then in power had likewise had the prudence to preserve\r\nin their functions such pupils and engineers in the civil line as\r\nwere of an age to come under the requisition. Whatever might be the\r\nwant of defenders, it was felt that it requires ten years' study to\r\nform an engineer; while health and courage suffice for making a\r\nsoldier. This disastrous period affords instances of foresight and\r\nskill which have not always been imitated in times more tranquil.\r\n\r\nThe Sciences had just rendered great services to the country. They\r\nwere calumniated; those who had made use of them were compelled to\r\ndefend them, and did so with courage. A circumstance, equally\r\nsingular and unforeseen, occasioned complete recourse to be had to\r\ntheir assistance.\r\n\r\nAn officer arrived at the Committee of Public Welfare: he announced\r\nthat the republican armies were in presence of the enemy; but that\r\nthe French generals durst not march their soldiers to battle, because\r\nthe brandies were poisoned, and that the sick in the hospitals,\r\nhaving drunk some, had died. He requested the Committee to cause them\r\nto be examined, asked for orders on this subject, and wished to set\r\noff again immediately.\r\n\r\nThe most skilful chymists were instantly assembled: they were ordered\r\nto analyze the brandies, and to indicate, in the course of the day,\r\nthe poison and the remedy.\r\n\r\nThese _savans_ laboured without intermission, trusting only to\r\nthemselves for the most minute details. Scarcely was time allowed\r\nthem to finish their operations, when they were summoned to appear\r\nbefore the Committee of Public Welfare, over which ROBESPIERRE\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nThey announced that the brandies were not poisoned, and that water\r\nonly had been added to them, in which was slate in suspension, so\r\nthat it was sufficient to filter them, in order to deprive them of\r\ntheir hurtful quality.\r\n\r\nROBESPIERRE, who hoped to discover a treason, asked the Commissioners\r\nif they were perfectly sure of what they had just advanced. As a\r\nsatisfactory answer to the question, one of them took a strainer,\r\npoured the liquor through it, and drank it without hesitation. All\r\nthe others followed his example. \"What!\" said ROBESPIERRE to him, \"do\r\nyou dare to drink these poisoned brandies?\"----\"I durst do much\r\nmore,\" answered he, \"when I put my name to the Report.\"\r\n\r\nThis service, though in itself of little importance, impressed the\r\npublic mind with a conception of the utility of the _savans_, a\r\ngreater number of whom were called into the Committee of Public\r\nWelfare. There they were secure from subaltern informers, with which\r\nFrance abounded. Having concerns only with the members charged with\r\nthe military department, who were endeavouring to save them, they\r\nmight, by keeping silence, escape the suspicious looks of the tyrants\r\nof the day. There was then but one resource for men of merit and\r\nvirtue, namely, to conceal their existence, and cause themselves to\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this sanguinary persecution, all the means of defence\r\nemployed by France, issued from the obscure retreat where the genius\r\nof the Sciences had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nPowder was the article for which there was the most urgent occasion.\r\nThe soldiers were on the point of wanting it. The magazines were\r\nempty. The administrators of the powder-mills were assembled to know\r\nwhat they could do. They declared that the annual produce amounted to\r\nthree millions of pounds only, that the basis of it was saltpetre\r\ndrawn from India, that extraordinary encouragements might raise them\r\nto five millions; but that no hopes ought to be entertained of\r\nexceeding that quantity. When the members of the Committee of Public\r\nWelfare announced to the administrators that they must manufacture\r\nseventeen millions of pounds of powder in the space of a few months,\r\nthe latter remained stupified. \"If you succeed in doing this,\" said\r\nthey, \"you must have a method of making powder of which we are\r\nignorant.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was the only mean of saving the country. As the French\r\nwere almost excluded from the sea, it was impossible to think of\r\nprocuring saltpetre from India. The _savans_ offered to extract all\r\nfrom the soil of the Republic. A general requisition called to this\r\nlabour the whole mass of the people. Short and simple directions,\r\nspread with inconceivable activity, made, of a difficult art, a\r\ncommon process. All the abodes of men and animals were explored.\r\nSaltpetre was sought for even in the ruins of Lyons; and soda,\r\ncollected from among the ashes of the forests of La Vendée.\r\n\r\nThe results of this grand movement would have been useless, had not\r\nthe Sciences been seconded by new efforts. Native saltpetre is not\r\nfit for making powder; it is mixed with salts and earths which render\r\nit moist, and diminish its activity. The process employed for\r\npurifying it demanded considerable time. The construction of\r\npowder-mills alone would have required several months, and before\r\nthat period, France might have been subjugated. Chymistry invented\r\nnew methods for refining and drying saltpetre in a few days. As a\r\nsubstitute for mills, pulverized charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre\r\nwere mixed, with copper balls, in casks which were turned round by\r\nhand. By these means, powder was made in twelve hours; and thus was\r\nverified that bold assertion of a member of the Committee of Public\r\nWelfare: \"Earth impregnated with saltpetre shall be produced,\" said\r\nhe, \"and, in five days after, your cannon shall be loaded.\"\r\n\r\nCircumstances were favourable for fixing, in all their perfection,\r\nthe only arts which occupied France. Persons from all the departments\r\nwere sent to Paris, in order to be instructed in the manufacture of\r\narms and saltpetre. Rapid courses of lectures were given on this\r\nsubject. They contributed little to the general movement, which had\r\nsaved the Republic, but they had an effect no less important, that of\r\nbringing to light the astonishing facility of the French for\r\nacquiring the arts and sciences; a happy gift which forms one of the\r\nfinest features in the character of the nation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so many services rendered by the Sciences, the\r\nlearned were not less persecuted; the most celebrated among them were\r\nthe most exposed. The venerable DAUBENTON, the co-operator in the\r\nlabours of BUFFON, escaped persecution only because he had written a\r\nwork on the improvement of sheep, and was taken for a simple\r\nshepherd. COUSIN was not so fortunate; yet, in his confinement, he\r\nhad the stoicism to compose works of geometry, and give lessons of\r\nphysics to his companions of misfortune.\r\n\r\nLAVOISIER, that immortal character, whose generosity in promoting the\r\nprogress of science could be equalled only by his own enlightened\r\nexample in cultivating it, was also apprehended. As one of the\r\nCommissioners for fixing the standard of weights and measures, great\r\nhopes were entertained that he might be restored to liberty. Measures\r\nwere taken with that intention; but these were not suited to the\r\nspirit of the moment. The commission was dissolved, and LAVOISIER\r\nleft in prison. Shortly after, this ever to be lamented _savant_ was\r\ntaken to the scaffold. He would still be living, had his friends\r\nacted on the cupidity of the tyrants who then governed, instead of\r\nappealing to their justice.\r\n\r\nAbout this period, some members of the Convention having introduced a\r\ndiscussion in favour of public instruction, it was strongly opposed\r\nby the revolutionary party, who saw in the Sciences nothing but a\r\npoison which enervated republics. According to them, the finest\r\nschools were the popular societies. To do good was then impossible,\r\nand to shew an inclination to do it, exposed to the greatest danger\r\nthe small number of enlightened men France still possessed.\r\n\r\nIn this point of view, every thing was done that circumstances\r\npermitted. A military school was created, where young men from all\r\nthe departments were habituated to the exercise of arms and the life\r\nof a camp. It was called _L'École de Mars_. Its object was not to\r\nform officers, but intelligent soldiers, who, spread in the French\r\narmies, should soon render them the most enlightened of Europe, as\r\nthey were already the most inured to the hardships of war.\r\n\r\nThus, a small number of men, whose conduct has been too ill\r\nappreciated, alone retarded, by constant efforts, the progress of\r\nbarbarism and struggled in a thousand ways against the oppression\r\nwhich others contented themselves with supporting.\r\n\r\nAt length, the bloody throne, raised by ROBESPIERRE, was overthrown:\r\nhope succeeded to terror; and victory, to defeat. Then, the Sciences,\r\nissuing from the focus in which they had been concentered and\r\nconcealed, reappeared in all their lustre. The services they had\r\nrendered, the dangers which had threatened them, were felt and\r\nacknowledged. The plan of campaign, formed by the scientific men,\r\ncalled to the Committee of Public Welfare, had completely succeeded.\r\nThe French armies had advanced on the rear of those of the allies,\r\nand, threatening to cut off their retreat, not only forced them to\r\nabandon the places they had taken, but also marched from conquest to\r\nconquest on their territory.\r\n\r\nThe means of having iron, steel, saltpetre, powder, and arms, had\r\nbeen created during the reign of terror. The following were the\r\nresults of this grand movement at the beginning of the third year of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nTwelve millions of pounds of saltpetre extracted from the soil of\r\nFrance in the space of nine months. Formerly, scarcely one million\r\nwas drawn from it.\r\n\r\nFifteen founderies at work for the casting of brass cannon. Their\r\nannual produce increased to 7000 pieces. There existed in France but\r\ntwo establishments of this description before the revolution.\r\n\r\nThirty founderies for iron ordnance, yielding 13,000 pieces per year.\r\nAt the breaking out of the war, there were but four, which yielded\r\nannually 900 pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nThe buildings for the manufacture of shells, shot, and all the\r\nimplements of artillery, multiplied in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nTwenty new manufactories for side-arms, directed by a new process.\r\nBefore the war, there existed but one.\r\n\r\nAn immense manufactory of fire-arms established all at once in Paris,\r\nand yielding 140,000 muskets per year, that is, more than all the old\r\nmanufactories together. Several establishments of this nature formed\r\non the same plan in the different departments of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eighty-eight workshops for repairing arms of every\r\ndescription. Before the war, there existed but six.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a manufactory of carbines, the making of which\r\nwas till then unknown in France.\r\n\r\nThe art of renewing the touch-hole of cannon discovered, and carried\r\nimmediately to a perfection which admits of its being exercised in\r\nthe midst of camps.\r\n\r\nA description of the means by which tar, necessary for the navy, may\r\nbe speedily extracted from the pine-tree.\r\n\r\nBalloons and telegraphs converted into machines of war.\r\n\r\nAll the process of the arts relative to war simplified and improved\r\nby the application of the most learned theories.\r\n\r\nA secret establishment formed at Meudon for that purpose. Experiments\r\nthere made on the oxy-muriate of potash, on fire-balls, on\r\nhollow-balls, on ring-balls, &c.\r\n\r\nGreat works begun for extracting from the soil of France every thing\r\nthat serves for the construction, equipment, and supplies of ships of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nSeveral researches for replacing or reproducing the principal\r\nmaterials which the exigencies of the war had consumed, and for\r\nincreasing impure potash, which the making of powder had snatched\r\nfrom the other manufactories.\r\n\r\nSimple and luminous directions for fixing the art of making soap, and\r\nbringing it within reach of the meanest capacity.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the composition of which pencils are now made in\r\nFrance, the black lead for which was previously drawn from England;\r\nand what was inappreciable in those critical circumstances, the\r\ndiscovery of a method for tanning, in a few days, leather which\r\ngenerally required several years' preparation.\r\n\r\nIn a word, if we speak of the territorial acquisitions, which were\r\nthe result of the victories obtained by means of the extraordinary\r\nresources created by the men of science, France has acquired an\r\nextent of 1,498 square leagues, and a population of 4,381,266\r\nindividuals; namely, Savoy, containing 411,700 inhabitants; the\r\nCounty of Nice, 93,166; Avignon, the _Comtat Venaissin_, and Dutch\r\nFlanders, 200,500; Maëstricht and Venloo, 90,000; Belgium, 1,880,000;\r\nthe left bank of the Rhine, 1,658,500; Geneva and its territory,\r\n40,000; and Mulhausen, 7,200.\r\n\r\nP.S. Paris is now all mirth and gaiety; in consequence of the revived\r\npleasures of the Carnival. I shall not give you my opinion of it till\r\nits conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. Letter XXXIV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The bells produced 27,442,852 pounds of metal. This\r\narticle, valued at 10 _sous_ per pound, represents 15 millions of\r\nfrancs (_circa_ £625,000 sterling). A part served for the fabrication\r\nof copper coin, the remainder furnished pieces of ordnance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 28, 1802._\r\n\r\nIn all great cities, one may naturally expect to find great vices;\r\nbut in regard to gaming, this capital presents a scene which, I will\r\nventure to affirm, is not to be matched in any part of the world. No\r\nwhere is the passion, the rage for play so prevalent, so universal:\r\nno where does it cause so much havock and ruin. In every class of\r\nsociety here, gamesters abound. From men revelling in wealth to those\r\nscarcely above beggary, every one flies to the gaming-table; so that\r\nit follows, as a matter of course, that Paris must contain a great\r\nnumber of _Maisons de jeu_, or\r\n\r\nPUBLIC GAMING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThey are to be met with in all parts of the town, though the\r\nhead-quarters are in the _Palais du Tribunat_, or, as it is most\r\ncommonly called, the _Palais Royal_. Whenever you come to Paris,\r\nand see, on the first story, a suite of rooms ostentatiously\r\nilluminated, and a blazing reverberator at the door, you may be\r\ncertain that it is a house of this description.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, gaming was not only tolerated in Paris, but\r\npublic gaming-houses were then licensed by the government, under the\r\nagreeable name of _Académies de jeu_. There, any one might ruin\r\nhimself under the immediate superintendance of the police, an officer\r\nbelonging to which was always present. Besides these academies, women\r\nof fashion and impures of the first class were allowed to keep a\r\ngaming-table or _tripot de jeu_, as it was termed, in their own\r\nhouse. This was a privilege granted to them in order that they might\r\nthereby recover their shattered fortune. When all the necessary\r\nexpenses were paid, these ladies commonly shared the profits with\r\ntheir protectors, that is, with their friends in power, through whose\r\nprotection the _tripot_ was sanctioned. Every one has heard of the\r\nfatal propensity to gaming indulged in by the unfortunate Marie\r\nAntoinette. The French women of quality followed her pernicious\r\nexample, as the young male nobility did that of the Count d'Artois\r\nand the Duke of Orleans; so that, however decided might be the\r\npersonal aversion of Lewis XVI to gaming, it never was more in\r\nfashion at the court of France than during his reign. This is a fact,\r\nwhich can be confirmed by General S---th and other Englishmen who\r\nhave played deep at the queen's parties.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, play is, as I have before stated, much recurred\r\nto as a financial resource, by many of the _ci-devant_ female\r\n_noblesse_ in Paris. In their parties, _bouillotte_ is the prevailing\r\ngame; and the speculation is productive, if the company will sit and\r\nplay. Consequently, the longer the sitting, the greater the profits.\r\nThe same lady who moralizes in the morning, and will read you a\r\nlecture on the mischievous consequences of gaming, makes not the\r\nsmallest hesitation to press you to sit down at her _bouillotte_ in\r\nthe evening, where she knows you will almost infallibly be a loser.\r\nNo protection, I believe, is now necessary for a lady who chooses to\r\nhave a little private gaming at her residence, under the specious\r\nnames of _société_, _bal_, _thé_, or _concert_. But this is not the\r\ncase with the _Maisons de jeu_, where the gaming-tables are public;\r\nor even with private houses, where the object of the speculation is\r\npublicly known. These purchase a license in the following manner. A\r\nperson, who is said to have several _sleeping_ partners, engages to\r\npay to the government the sum of 3,600,000 francs (_circa_ £150,000\r\nsterling) a year for the power of licensing all gaming-houses in this\r\ncapital, and also to account for a tenth part of the profits, which\r\nenter the coffer of the minister at the head of the department of the\r\npolice. This contribution serves to defray part of the expense of\r\ngreasing the wheels of that intricate machine. Without such a\r\nlicense, no gaming-house can be opened in Paris. Sometimes it is paid\r\nfor by a share in the profits, sometimes by a certain sum per\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nThese _Maisons de jeu_, where dupes are pitted against cheats, are\r\nfilled from morning to night with those restless beings, who, in\r\ntheir eager pursuit after fortune, almost all meet with\r\ndisappointment, wretchedness, ruin, and every mischief produced by\r\ngaming. This vice, however, carries with it its own punishment; but\r\nit is unconquerable in the heart which it ravages. It lays a man\r\nprostrate before those fantastic idols, distinguished by the\r\nsynonymous names of fate, chance, and destiny. It banishes from his\r\nmind the idea of enriching himself, or acquiring a competence by slow\r\nand industrious means. It feeds, it inflames his cupidity, and\r\ndeceives him in order to abandon him afterwards to remorse and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nFrom the mere impulse of curiosity, I have been led to visit some of\r\nthe principal _Maisons de jeu_. I shall therefore represent what I\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nIn a spacious suite of apartments, where different games of chance\r\nare played, is a table of almost immeasurable length, covered with a\r\ngreen cloth, with a red piece at one end, and a black, one at the\r\nother. It is surrounded by a crowd of persons of both sexes, squeezed\r\ntogether, who, all suspended between fear and hope, are waiting, with\r\neager eyes and open mouth, for the favourable or luckless chance. I\r\nwill suppose that the banker or person who deals the cards, announces\r\n\"_rouge perd, couleur gagne_.\" The oracle has spoken. At these words\r\nof fate, on one side of the table, you see countenances smiling, but\r\nwith a smile of inquietude, and on the other, long faces, on which is\r\nimprinted the palid hue of death. However, the losers recover from\r\ntheir stupor: they hope that the next chance will be more fortunate.\r\nIf that happens, and the banker calls out \"_rouge gagne, couleur\r\nperd_;\" then the scene changes, and the same persons whom you have\r\njust seen so gay, make a sudden transition from joy to sadness, and\r\n_vice versa_. This contrast no language can paint, and you must see\r\nit, in order to conceive how the most headstrong gamblers can spend\r\nhour after hour in such a continual state of agitation, in which they\r\nare alternately overwhelmed by rage, anguish, and despair. Some are\r\nseen plucking out their hair by the roots, scratching their face, and\r\ntearing their clothes to pieces, when, after having lost considerable\r\nsums, frequently they have not enough left to pay for a breakfast or\r\ndinner. What an instructive lesaon for the novice! What a subject of\r\nreflection for the philosophic spectator! At these scenes of folly\r\nand rapacity it is that the demon of suicide exults in the triumphs\r\nhe is on the point of gaining over the weakness, avarice, and false\r\npride of mortals. If the wretched victim has not recourse to a\r\npistol, he probably seeks a grave at the bottom of the river.\r\n\r\nAmong these professed gamblers, it often happens that some of them,\r\nin order to create what they term _resources_, imagine tricks and\r\nimpostures scarcely credible. I shall relate an anecdote which I\r\npicked up in the course of my inquiries respecting the garning-houses\r\nin Paris. It may be necessary to premise that the counterfeit louis,\r\nwhich are in circulation in this country, and have nearly the\r\nappearance of the real coin, are employed by these knaves; they\r\ncommonly produce them at night, because they then run less risk of\r\nbeing detected in passing them; but these means are very common and\r\nalmost out of date.\r\n\r\nIn the great gaming-houses in Paris, it is customary to have on the\r\ntable several _rouleaux_ of louis d'or. An old, experienced gambler\r\ncame one day to a house of this class, with his pockets full of\r\nleaden _rouleaux_ of the exact form and size of those containing\r\nfifty louis d'or. He placed at one of the ends of the table (either\r\nblack or red) one of his leaden _rouleaux_: he lost. The master of\r\nthe bank took up his _rouleau_, and, without opening it, put it with\r\nthe good _rouleaux_ in the middle of the table, where the bank is\r\nkept. The old gambler, without being disconcerted, staked another. He\r\nwon, and withdrew the good _rouleau_ given him, leaving the\r\ncounterfeit one on the table, at the same time calling out, \"I stake\r\nten louis out of the _rouleau_.\" The cards were drawn; he won: the\r\nbanker, to pay him the ten louis, took a _rouleau_ from the bank.\r\nChance willed that he lighted on the leaden _rouleau_. He endeavoured\r\nto break it open by striking it on the table: the _rouleau_ withstood\r\nhis efforts. The gambler, without deranging his features, then said\r\nto the banker; \"Mind you don't break it.\" The banker, disconcerted,\r\ntore the paper, and, on opening it, found it to contain nothing but\r\nlead. There being no positive proof against the gambler, he was\r\npermitted to retire, and his only punishment was to be in future\r\nexcluded from this gaming-house. But he had the consolation of\r\nknowing that ninety-nine others would be open to him. However, this\r\nand other impostures have led to a regulation, that, in all these\r\nhouses, the value of every stake should be apparent to the eye, and\r\nopenly exposed on the table.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said you might infer that _trente-et-un_ (or _rouge\r\net noir_) is the most fashionable game played here; but, though this\r\nis the case, it is not the only one in high vogue. Many others,\r\nequally pernicious, are pursued at the same time, such as _la\r\nroulette_, _passe-dix_, and _biribi_, at which cheats and sharpers\r\ncan, more at their ease, execute their feats of dexterity and schemes\r\nof plunder. Women frequent the gaming-tables as well as the men, and\r\noften pledge their last shift to make up a stake. It is shocking to\r\ncontemplate a young female gamester, the natural beauty of whose\r\ncountenance is distorted into deformity by a succession of agonizing\r\npassions. Yet so distressing an object is no uncommon thing in Paris.\r\n\r\nYou may, perhaps, be curious to know what are these games, of\r\n_trente-et-un_, _biribi_, _passe-dix,_ and _la roulette_. Never\r\nhaving played at any of them, such a description as I might pretend\r\nto give, could at best be but imperfect. For which, reason I shall\r\nnot engage in the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently affirmed that in the principal towns of France,\r\nnamely, Bordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, Rouen, &c. the rage for play is\r\nno less prevalent than in the capital, where gaming-houses daily\r\nincrease in number.[1] They are now established in every quarter in\r\nParis, even the poorest, and there are some where the lowest of the\r\npopulace can indulge in a _penchant_ for gaming, as the stake is\r\nproportioned to their means. This is the ruin of every class of\r\ninhabitants and of foreigners; so much so, that suicides here\r\nincrease in exact proportion to the increase of gaming-houses.\r\n\r\nIs it not astonishing that the government should suffer, still more\r\npromote the existence of an evil so pernicious in every point of\r\nview? From the present state of the French finances, it would,\r\nnotwithstanding, appear that every consideration, however powerful,\r\nmust yield to the want of money required for defraying the expenses\r\nof the department of the Police.\r\n\r\n_Minima de malis_ was the excuse of the old government of France for\r\npromoting gaming. \"From the crowd of dissipated characters of every\r\ndescription, accumulated in great cities,\" said its partisans,\r\n\"governments find themselves compelled to tolerate certain abuses, in\r\norder to avoid evils of greater magnitude. They are forced to\r\ncompound with the passions which they are unable to destroy; and it\r\nis better that men should be professed gamblers than usurers,\r\nswindlers, and thieves.\" Such was the reasoning employed in behalf of\r\nthe establishment of the _Académies de jeu_, which existed prior to\r\nthe revolution. Such is the reasoning reproduced, at the present day,\r\nin favour of the _Maisons de jeu_; but, when I reflect on all the\r\nhorrors occasioned by gaming, I most ardently wish that every\r\nargument in favour of so destructive a vice, may be combated by a pen\r\nlike that of Rousseau, which, Sir William Jones says, \"had the\r\nproperty of spreading light before it on the darkest objects, as if\r\nhe had written with phosphorus on the walls of a cavern.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: During the Carnival of the present year (1803) the\r\nmasked balls at the grand French Opera were quite deserted, in\r\nconsequence of a new gaming-house, established solely for foreigners,\r\nhaving, by the payment of considerable sums to the government,\r\nobtained permission to give masked balls. These balls were all the\r\nrage. There was one every Tuesday, and the employment of the whole\r\nweek was to procure cards of invitation; for persons were admitted by\r\n_invitation_ only, no money being taken. The rooms, though spacious,\r\nwere warm and comfortable; the company, tolerably good, and extremely\r\nnumerous, but chiefly composed of foreigners. _Treute-et-un_,\r\n_biribi_, _pharaon_, _creps_, and other fashionable games were\r\nplayed, so that the _speculators_ could very well afford to give all\r\nsorts of refreshments, and an elegant supper _gratis_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 1, 1802_.\r\n\r\nOf all the institutions subsisting here before the revolution, that\r\nwhich has experienced the greatest enlargement is the\r\n\r\nMUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThis establishment, formerly called _Le Jardin du Roi_, and now more\r\ncommonly known by the name of _Le Jardin des Plantes_, received its\r\npresent denomination by a decree of the National Convention, dated\r\nthe 10th of June 1793. It is situated on the south bank of the Seine,\r\nnearly facing the Arsenal, and consists of a botanical garden, a\r\ncollection of natural history, a library of works relating to that\r\nscience, an amphitheatre for the lectures, and a _ménagerie_ of\r\nliving animals.\r\n\r\nOriginally, it was nothing more than a garden for medicinal plants,\r\nformed under that title, in 1626, by GUY DE LA BROSSE, principal\r\nphysician to Lewis XIII, who sanctioned the establishment by letters\r\npatent. The king's physicians were almost always intendants of this\r\ngarden till the year 1739, when it was placed under the direction of\r\nBUFFON. Before his time, the cabinet was trifling. It consisted only\r\nof some curiosities collected by GEOFFROY, and a few shells which had\r\nbelonged to TOURNEFORT; but, through the zeal of BUFFON, and the care\r\nof his co-operator DAUBENTON, it became a general _dépôt_ of natural\r\nhistory, and its riches had increased still more than its utility. On\r\nthe breaking out of the revolution, it had been protected through\r\nthat sort of respect which the rudest men have for the productions of\r\nnature, whence they either receive or expect relief for their\r\nsufferings. It had even been constantly defended by the revolutionary\r\nadministration, under whose control and dependence it was placed.\r\nRegarding it, in some measure, as their private property, their pride\r\nwas interested in its preservation; and had any attempt been made to\r\ninjure it, they would infallibly have caused an insurrection among\r\nthe inhabitants of the surrounding _faubourg_. These singular\r\ncircumstances, joined to the good understanding prevailing among the\r\nprofessors, had maintained this fine establishment in a state, if not\r\nincreasing, at least stationary. On the revival of order, ideas were\r\nentertained of giving to it an extension which had already been\r\nprojected and decreed, even during the reign of terror.\r\n\r\nThe botanical garden was enlarged; the extent of the ground intended\r\nfor the establishment was doubled; a _ménagerie_ was formed; new\r\nhot-houses and new galleries were constructed; the addition of new\r\nprofessors was confirmed, and all the necessary disbursements were\r\nmade with magnificence. Thus, in the same place where every\r\nproduction of nature was assembled, natural history was for the first\r\ntime taught in its aggregate; and these courses of lectures, become\r\ncelebrated by the brilliancy of the facts illustrated in them, the\r\nnumber of pupils who frequent them, and the great works of which they\r\nhave been the cause or the motive, have rendered the MUSEUM OF\r\nNATURAL HISTORY one of the first establishments of instruction\r\nexisting in Europe.\r\n\r\nFormerly, there were but three professors attached to this\r\nestablishment. At present, there are no less than thirteen, who each\r\ngive a course of forty lectures. The courses of zoology and\r\nmineralogy take place in the halls of the cabinet containing the\r\ncollections corresponding to each of those sciences. The courses of\r\nbotany, anatomy, and chemistry are delivered in the great\r\namphitheatre, and that of natural iconography in the library. The\r\ndays and hours of the lectures are announced every year by particular\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\nThe establishment is administered, under the authority of the\r\nMinister of the Interior, by the professors, who choose, annually,\r\nfrom among themselves, a director. At present, that situation is held\r\nby FOURCROY. Although this celebrated professor, in his lectures on\r\nchemistry, must principally attach himself to minerals, the\r\nparticular object of chemical inquiry, he is far from neglecting\r\nvegetable and animal substances, the analysis of which will, in time,\r\nspread great light on organic bodies. The most recent discoveries on\r\nthe exact constitution of bodies are made known in the course of\r\nthese lectures, and a series of experiments, calculated for\r\nelucidating the demonstrations, takes place under the eyes of the\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\nNo one possesses more than FOURCROY the rare talent of classing well\r\nhis subjects, of presenting facts in a striking point of view, and of\r\nconnecting them by a succession of ideas extremely rapid, and\r\nexpressed in a voice whose melody gives an additional charm to\r\neloquence. The pleasure of hearing him is peculiarly gratifying; and,\r\nindeed, when he delivers a lecture, the amphitheatre, spacious as it\r\nis, is much too small to contain the crowd of auditors. Then, the\r\nyoung pupils are seen with their eyes stedfastly fixed on their\r\nmaster, catching his word with avidity, and fearing to lose one of\r\nthem; thus paying by their attention the most flattering tribute to\r\nthe astonishing facility of this orator of science, from whose lips\r\nnaturally flow, as from a spring, the most just and most select\r\nexpressions. Frequently too, carried away by the torrent of his\r\neloquence, they forget what they have just heard, to think only of\r\nwhat he is saying. FOURCROY speaks in this manner for upwards of two\r\nhours, without any interruption, and, what is more, without tiring\r\neither his auditors or himself. He writes with no less facility than\r\nhe speaks. This is proved by the great number of works which he has\r\npublished. But in his writings, his style is more calm, more smooth\r\nthan that of his lectures.\r\n\r\nEach professor superintends and arranges the part of the collections\r\ncorresponding to the science which he is charged to teach. For this\r\npurpose, there are also assistant naturalists, whose employment is to\r\nprepare the various articles of natural history. The keeper of the\r\ncabinet, under the authority of the director, takes all the measures\r\nnecessary for the preservation of the collections. The principal ones\r\nare:\r\n\r\n1. The cabinet of natural history, containing the animal kingdom,\r\ndivided into its classes; the mineral kingdom; the fossils, woods,\r\nfruits, and other vegetable productions, together with the herbals.\r\nThis cabinet, which occupies the buildings on the right, on entering\r\nfrom the street, is open to students on Mondays, Wednesdays, and\r\nSaturdays, from eleven o'clock till two, and to the public in general\r\nevery Tuesday and Friday in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n2. The library, chiefly composed of works relating to natural\r\nhistory, contains, among other valuable articles, an immense\r\ncollection of animals and plants, painted on vellum. Three painters\r\nare charged to continue this collection under the superintendance of\r\nthe professors. The library is open to the public every day from\r\neleven o'clock to two.\r\n\r\n3. The cabinet of anatomy, containing the preparations relative to\r\nthe human race and to animals. It is situated in a separate building,\r\nand for the present open to students only.\r\n\r\n4. The botanical school, containing the plants growing in the open\r\nground, and the numerous hot-houses in which are cultivated those\r\npeculiar to warm countries.\r\n\r\n5. The _ménagerie_ of foreign animals. At the present moment, they\r\nare dispersed in various parts of the garden; but they are shortly to\r\nbe assembled in a spacious and agreeable place.\r\n\r\n6. The chemical laboratory and the collection of chemical\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added a laboratory for the preparation of objects of\r\nnatural history, and another for that of objects of anatomy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the improved state to which BUFFON had brought this\r\nestablishment, yet, through the united care of the several scientific\r\nmen who have since had the direction of it, the constant attention\r\nbestowed on it by the government, and even by the conquests of the\r\nFrench armies, its riches have been so much increased, that its\r\ncollection of natural history may at this day be considered as the\r\nfinest in being. The department of the minerals and that of the\r\nquadrupeds are nearly complete; that of the birds is one of the most\r\nconsiderable and the handsomest known; and the other classes, without\r\nanswering yet the idea which a naturalist might conceive of thenm,\r\nare, nevertheless, superior to what other countries have to offer.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious or scarce articles in this Museum, the following\r\nclaim particular notice:\r\n\r\nIn the class of quadrupeds, adult individuals, stuffed, such as the\r\ncamelopard, the hippopotamus, the single-horned rhinoceros, the\r\nMadagascar squirrel, the Senegal lemur, two varieties of the\r\noran-outang, the proboscis-monkey, different specimens of the indri,\r\nsome new species of bats and opossums, the Batavian kangaroo, and\r\nseveral antelopes, ant-eaters, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the class of birds, a great number of new or rare species, and\r\namong those remarkable either for size or beauty, are the golden\r\nvulture, the great American eagle, the Impey peacock, the Ju[<blot>]\r\npheasant or argus, the plantain-eater, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the reptiles, the crocodile of the Ganges, the fimbriated\r\ntortoise of Cayenne, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the shells, the glass patella, and a number of valuable,\r\nscarce, or new species.\r\n\r\nThe collection of insects has just been completed through the\r\nassiduity of the estimable LAMARCK, the professor who has charge of\r\nthat department.\r\n\r\nIn the mineral kingdom, independently of the numerous and select\r\nchoice of all the specimens, are to be remarked as objects of\r\nparticular curiosity, the petrifactions of crocodiles' bones found in\r\nthe mountain of St. Pierre at Maëstricht, and the collection of\r\nimpressions of fishes from Mount Bolca, near Verona.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the _ménagerie_ contains a female elephant\r\nonly, the male having died since my arrival in Paris, three\r\ndromedaries, two camels, five lions, male and female, a white bear, a\r\nbrown bear, a mangousta, a civet, an alligator, an ostrich, and\r\nseveral other scarce and curious animals, the number and variety of\r\nwhich receive frequent additions. In other parts of the garden are\r\ninclosures for land and sea fowls, as well as ponds for fishes.\r\n\r\nThe denomination of _Jardin des Plantes_ is very appropriate to this\r\ngarden, as it furnishes to all the botanical establishments\r\nthroughout France seeds of trees and plants useful to the\r\np[<blot>]ess of agriculture and of the arts; and hence the indigent\r\npoor are supplied with such medicinal plants as are proper for the\r\ncure or relief of their complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 3, 1802._\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly observed that civilized nations adhere to\r\ntheir ancient customs for no other reason than because they are\r\nancient. The French have, above all, a most decided partiality for\r\nthose which afford them opportunities of amusement. It must therefore\r\nhave been a subject of no small regret to them, on the annual return\r\nof those periods, to find the government taking every measure for the\r\nsuppression of old habits. For some years since the revolution, all\r\ndisguises and masquerades were strictly prohibited; but, though the\r\nexecutive power forbade pasteboard masks, its authority could not\r\nextend to those mental disguises which have been occasionally worn by\r\nmany leading political characters in this country. No sooner was the\r\nprohibition against masquerading removed, than the Parisians gave\r\nfull scope to the indulgence of their inclination; and this year was\r\nrevived, in all its glory, the celebration of\r\n\r\nTHE CARNIVAL.\r\n\r\nYesterday was the conclusion of that mirthful period, during which\r\nFolly seemed to have taken possession of all the inhabitants of this\r\npopulous city. Every thing that gaiety, whim, humour, and\r\neccentricity could invent, was put in practice to render it a sort of\r\ncontinued jubilee. From morn to night, the concourse of masks of\r\nevery description was great beyond any former example; but still\r\ngreater was the concourse of spectators. All the principal streets\r\nand public gardens were thronged by singular characters, in\r\nappropriate dresses, moving about in small detached parties or in\r\nnumerous close bodies, on foot, on horseback, or in carriages. The\r\n_Boulevards_, the _Rue de la Loi_, and the _Rue St. Honoré_,\r\nexhibited long processions of masks and grotesque figures, crowded\r\nboth in the inside and on the outside of vehicles of all sorts, from\r\na _fiacre_ to a German waggon, drawn by two, four, six, and eight\r\nhorses; while the _Palais Royal_, the _Tuileries_, the _Place de la\r\nConcorde_, and the _Champs Elysées_ were filled with pedestrian wits,\r\namusing the surrounding multitude by the liveliness of their sallies\r\nand the smartness of their repartee. Here S[<blot>]pins,\r\nScaramouches, Punchinellos, Pierrots, Harlequins, and Columbines,\r\ntogether with nuns, friars, abbés, bishops, and _marquis_ in\r\ncaricature, enlivened the scene: there, sultans, sultanas,\r\njanissaries, mamlûks, Turks, Spaniards, and Indians, in stately\r\npride, attracted attention. On one side, a Mars and Venus, an Apollo\r\nand Daphne, figured under the attributes of heathen mythology: on\r\nanother, more than one Adam and Eve recalled to mind the origin of\r\nthe creation.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of an untravelled Englishman, the novelty of this sight\r\nmust have been a source of no small entertainment. If he was of a\r\nreflecting mind, however, it must have given rise to a variety of\r\nobservations, and some of them of a rather serious nature. In\r\nadmiring the order and decency which reigned amidst so much mirth and\r\nhumour, he must have been desirous to appreciate the influence of\r\npolitical events on the character of this people. In a word, he must\r\nhave been anxious to ascertain how far the return of our Gallic\r\nneighbours to their ancient habits, announces a return to their\r\nancient institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Carnival of modern times is an imitation of\r\nthe Saturnalia of the ancients, and that the celebration of those\r\nfestivals was remarkable for the liberty which universally prevailed;\r\nslaves being, at that period, permitted to ridicule their masters,\r\nand speak with freedom on every subject. During the last years of the\r\nFrench monarchy, the Parisians neglected not to avail themselves of\r\nthis privilege. When all classes were confounded, at the time of the\r\nCarnival, the most elevated became exposed to the lash of the lowest;\r\nand, under the mask of satire, the abuses which had crept into\r\nreligious societies, and the corruption which prevailed in every\r\ndepartment of the State, escaped not their bold censure. From a\r\nconsciousness, no doubt, of their own weakness, the different\r\ngovernments that have ruled over France since the revolution, dreaded\r\nthe renewal of scenes in which their tottering authority might be\r\noverthrown; but such an apprehension cannot have been entertained by\r\nthe present government, as manifestly appears from the almost\r\nunlimited license which has reigned during the late Carnival.\r\nNotwithstanding which, it is worthy of remark that no satirical\r\ndisguises were met with, no shafts of ridicule were aimed at the\r\nconstituted authorities, no invective was uttered against such and\r\nsuch an opinion, no abuse was levelled against this or that party.\r\nCensure and malice either slept or durst not shew themselves, though\r\nfreedom of expression seemed to be under no restraint.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when the people appeared indifferent to the motley\r\namusements of the Carnival, and little disposed to mix in them,\r\neither as actors or spectators, it was not uncommon for the\r\ngovernment to pay for some masquerading. The _mouchards_ and\r\nunderlings of the police were habited as grotesque characters,\r\ncalculated to excite curiosity, and promote mirth. They then spread\r\nthemselves, to the number of two or three thousand, over different\r\nparts of the town, and gave to the streets of Paris a false colouring\r\nof joy and gladness; for the greater the misery of the people, the\r\nmore was it thought necessary to exhibit an outward representation of\r\npublic felicity. But these political impostures, having been seen\r\nthrough, at length failed in their effect, and were nearly\r\nrelinquished before the revolution. At that time, nothing diverted\r\nthe populace so much as _attrapes_ or bites; and every thing that\r\nengendered gross and filthy ideas was sure to please. Pieces of\r\nmoney, heated purposely, were scattered on the pavement, in order\r\nthat persons, who attempted to pick them up, might burn their\r\nfingers. Every sort of bite was practised; but the greatest\r\nattraction and acme of delight consisted of _chianlits_, that is,\r\npersons masked, walking about, apparently, in their shirt, the tail\r\nof which was besmeared with mustard.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, these coarse and disgusting jokes are evidently\r\nlaid aside, as some of a more rational kind are exhibited; such as\r\nthe nun, partly concealed in a truss of straw, and strapped on the\r\ncatering friar's back; the effect of the galvanic fluid; and many\r\nothers too numerous to mention. No factitious mirth was this year\r\ndisplayed; it was all natural; and if it did not add to the small sum\r\nof happiness of the distressed part of the Parisian community, it\r\nmust, for a while at least, have made them forget their wretchedness.\r\nWith few exceptions, every one seemed employed in laughing or in\r\nexciting laughter. Many of the characters assumed were such as\r\nafforded an opportunity of displaying a particular species of wit or\r\nhumour; but the dress of some of the masquerading parties, being an\r\nexcellent imitation of the rich costumes of Asia, must have been\r\nextremely expensive.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the masked balls at the Opera, on the last days of the\r\nCarnival, were numerously attended. Very few characters were here\r\nattempted, and those were but faintly supported. Adventures are the\r\nprincipal object of the frequenters of these balls, and I have reason\r\nto think that the persons who went in quest of them were not\r\ndisappointed. In short, though I have often passed the Carnival in\r\nParis, I never witnessed one that went off with greater _éclat_. As\r\nthe Turkish Spy observes, a small quantity of ashes, dropped, the day\r\nafter its conclusion, on the head of these people in disguise, cools\r\ntheir frenzy. From being mad and foolish, they become calm and\r\nrational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 5, 1802._\r\n\r\nAs I foresee that my private affairs will, probably, require my\r\npresence in England sooner than I expected, I hasten to give you an\r\nidea of the principal public edifices which I have not, yet noticed.\r\nOne of these is the _Luxembourg_ Palace, now called the\r\n\r\nPALAIS DU SÉNAT CONSERVATEUR.\r\n\r\nMary of Medicis, relict of Henry IV, having purchased of the Duke of\r\nLuxembourg his hotel and its dependencies, erected on their site this\r\npalace. It was built in 1616, under the direction of JACQUES DE\r\nBROSSE, on the plan of the _Pitti_ palace at Florence.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Louvre_, the _Luxembourg_ is the most spacious palace in\r\nParis. It is particularly distinguished for its bold character, its\r\nregularity, and the beauty of its proportions. The whole façade is\r\nornamented with coupled pilasters: on the ground-floor, the Tuscan\r\norder is employed, and above, the Doric, with alternate rustics. In\r\nthe four pavilions, placed at the angles of the principal pile, the\r\nIonic has been added to the other two orders, because they are more\r\nelevated than the rest of the buildings. Towards the _Rue de\r\nTournon_, the two pavilions communicate by a handsome terrace, in the\r\nmiddle of which is a circular saloon, surmounted by a dome of the\r\nmost elegant proportion. Beneath this dome is the principal entrance.\r\nThe court is spacious, and on each side of it are covered arches\r\nwhich form galleries on the ground-floor and in front of the upper\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four pictures which Mary of Medicis had caused to be\r\npainted by the celebrated RUBENS, for the gallery of the\r\n_Luxembourg_, had been removed from it some years before the\r\nrevolution. At that time even, they were intended for enriching the\r\nMuseum of the _Louvre_. Four of them are now exhibited there in the\r\nGreat Gallery. They are allegorical; with the other twenty, they\r\nrepresent the prosperous part of the history of that queen, and form\r\na striking contrast to the adversity she afterwards experienced\r\nthrough the persecution of Cardinal Richelieu.\r\n\r\nTo gratify his revenge, he ordered all the furniture, &c. belonging\r\nto Mary of Medicis to be sold, together with the statues which then\r\ndecorated the courts and garden of the _Luxembourg_, and pursued with\r\ninveteracy the unfortunate queen who had erected this magnificent\r\nedifice. Being exiled from France in 1631, she wandered for a long\r\ntime in Flanders, and also in England, till the implacable cardinal\r\nprevailed on Charles I, to command her to quit the kingdom. In 1642,\r\nshe took refuge at Cologne, and, at the age of 68, there died in a\r\ngarret, almost through hunger and distress.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, this palace belonged to MONSIEUR, next brother\r\nto Lewis XVI. It has since been occupied by the Directory, each of\r\nwhose members here had apartments. No material change has yet been\r\nmade in it; nor does any thing announce that the partial alterations\r\nintended, either in its exterior or interior, will speedily be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n  \"----_Pendent opera interrupta minæque, &c._\"\r\n\r\nAt the present day, the _Luxembourg_ is appropriated to the\r\nConservative Senate, whose name it has taken, and who here hold their\r\nsittings in a hall, fitted up in a style of magnificence still\r\nsuperior to that of the Legislative Body. But the sittings of the\r\nformer are not public like those of the latter; and as I had no more\r\nthan a peep at their fine hall, I cannot enter into a description of\r\nits beauties.\r\n\r\nHowever, I took a view of their garden, in which I had formerly\r\npassed many a pleasant hour. Here, workmen are employed in making\r\nconsiderable improvements. It was before very irregular, particularly\r\ntowards the south, where the view from the palace was partly\r\nconcealed by the buildings of the monastery of the Carthusians. By\r\ndegrees, these irregularities are made to disappear, and this garden\r\nwill shortly be laid out in such a manner as to correspond better\r\nwith the majesty of the palace, and display its architecture to\r\ngreater advantage. Alleys of trees, which were decayed from age, have\r\nbeen cut down, and replaced by young plants of thriving growth. In\r\nfront of the south façade is to be a tasteful parterre, with an\r\noblong piece of water in its centre. Beyond the garden is a large\r\npiece of ground formerly belonging to the Carthusian monastery, which\r\nis now nearly demolished; this ground is to be converted into a\r\nnational nursery for all sorts of valuable fruit-trees. Being\r\ncontiguous to the garden of the Senate, with which it communicates,\r\nit will furnish a very extensive promenade, and consequently add to\r\nthe agreeableness of the place.\r\n\r\nThe present Minister of the Interior, CHAPTAL, who cultivates the\r\narts and sciences with no less zeal than success, purposes to make\r\nhere essays on the culture of vine-plants of every species, in order\r\nto obtain comparative results, which will throw a new light on that\r\nbranch of rural economy.\r\n\r\nA great number of vases and statues are placed in the garden of the\r\nSenate. Many of these works are indifferently executed, though a few\r\nof them are in a good style. Certainly, a more judicious and more\r\ndecorous choice ought to have been made. It was not necessary to\r\nexcite regret in the mind of the moralist, by placing under the eyes\r\nof the public figures of both sexes which are repugnant to modesty.\r\n\r\nIf it be really meant to attempt to mend the loose morals of the\r\nnation, why are nudities, which may be considered as the leaven of\r\ncorruption, exposed thus in this and other national gardens in Paris?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_March 5, in continuation_.\r\n\r\nSt. Foix, in his \"_Essais historiques sur Paris_\" speaking of the\r\nBastille, says, \"it is a castle, which, without being strong, is one\r\nof the most formidable in Europe.\" In their arduous struggle for\r\nliberty, the French have scarcely left a vestige of this dread abode,\r\nin which have been immured so many victims of political vengeance. I\r\nwill not pretend to affirm that such is the description of prisoners\r\nnow confined in\r\n\r\nLE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nBut when the liberty of individuals lies at the mercy of arbitrary\r\npower, every one has a right to draw his own inference.\r\n\r\nThis edifice takes its name from the Templars, whose chief residence\r\nit was till they were annihilated in 1313. Philip the Fair and\r\nClement V contrived, under various absurd pretences, to massacre and\r\nburn the greater part of the knights of this order. The knights of\r\nSt. John of Jerusalem were put in possession of all the property of\r\nthe Templars, except such part as the king of France and the Pope\r\nthought fit to share between them. The _Temple_ then became the\r\nprovincial house of the Grand Priory of France.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Priory consisted of the inclosure within the walls of the\r\n_Temple_, where stood a palace for the Grand Prior, a church, and\r\nseveral houses inhabited by shopkeepers and mechanics; but, with the\r\nconsiderable domains annexed to it, this post, before the revolution,\r\nyielded to the eldest son of the Count d'Artois, as Grand Prior, an\r\nannual revenue of 200,000 livres. The inclosure was at that time a\r\nplace of refuge for debtors, where they enjoyed the privilege of\r\nfreedom from arrest.\r\n\r\nThe palace was erected by JACQUES SOUVRÉ, Grand Prior of France. Near\r\nit, is a large Gothic tower of a square form, flanked by four round\r\nturrets of great elevation, built by HUBERT, treasurer to the\r\nTemplars, who died in 1222.\r\n\r\nIt was in this building, which was considered as one of the most\r\nsolid in France, that Lewis XVI was confined from the middle of\r\nSeptember 1792 to the day of his execution. From the 13th of August\r\ntill that period, the royal family had occupied the part of the\r\npalace which has been preserved. This tower, when it had been\r\nentirely insulated and surrounded by a ditch, was inclosed by a high\r\nwall, which also included part of the garden. The casements were\r\nprovided with strong iron bars, and masked by those shutters, called,\r\nI believe, _trunk-lights_. As for the life which the unhappy monarch\r\nled in this prison, a detailed narrative of it has been published in\r\nEngland, by Cléry, his faithful _valet-de-chambre_.\r\n\r\nI have not been very anxious to approach the _Temple_, because I\r\nconcluded that, if fame was not a liar, there was no probability of\r\nmy having an opportunity of seeing any part of it, except the outer\r\nwall. The result was a confirmation of my opinion. Who are its\r\noccupiers? What is their number? What are their crimes? These are\r\nquestions which naturally intrude themselves on the mind, when one\r\nsurveys the turrets of this new Bastille--for, whether a place of\r\nconfinement for state-prisoners be called _La Bastille_ or _Le\r\nTemple_, nevertheless it is a state-prison, and reminds one of\r\nslavery, which, as Sterne says, is, in any disguise, a bitter\r\ndraught; and though thousands, in all ages, have been made to drink\r\nof it, still it is not, on that account, less bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 8, 1802_.\r\n\r\nNothing would give me greater pleasure than to be always able to\r\nanswer your inquiries without hesitation. Considering the round of\r\namusements in which I live, I flatter myself you will readily admit\r\nthat it requires no small share of good-will and perseverance to\r\ndevote so much time to scribbling for your entertainment. As for\r\ninformation, you will, on your arrival in Paris, know how much or how\r\nlittle you have derived from the perusal of my letters. You will then\r\nhave it in your power to compare and judge. With the originals before\r\nyou, you cannot be at a loss to determine how far the sketches\r\nresemble them.\r\n\r\nSome of your inquiries have been already answered in my former\r\nletters. Among the number, however, you will find no reply on the\r\nsubject of the\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF THE FRENCH PRESS.\r\n\r\nThis question being of a nature no less delicate than that concerning\r\nthe police, you cannot but commend my discretion in adopting a\r\nsimilar method to gratify your curiosity; that is, to refer you to\r\nthe intelligent author whom I quoted on the former occasion. If\r\ncommon report speaks the truth--_Sit mihi fas audita loqui?_--the\r\npress here is now in much the same state in which it was before the\r\nrevolution. I shall therefore borrow again the language of MERCIER,\r\nwho is a famous dreamer, inasmuch as many of his dreams have been\r\nrealized: yet, with all his foresight and penetration, I question\r\nwhether he ever dreamt that his picture of the French press, drawn in\r\nthe interval between the years 1781 and 1788, would still be, in some\r\nrespects, a true one at the beginning of the year 1802. But, as\r\nBoileau shrewdly remarks,\r\n\r\n  \"_Le vrai peut quelquefois n'être pas vraisemblable._\"\r\n\r\n\"The enemies of books,\" says our author, \"are the enemies of,\r\nknowledge, and consequently of mankind. The shackles with which the\r\npress is loaded, are an incitement for setting them at defiance. If\r\nwe were to enjoy a decent liberty, we should no longer have recourse\r\nto licentiousness. There are political evils which the liberty of the\r\npress prevents, and this is already a great benefit. The interior\r\npolice of States requires to be enlightened by disinterested\r\nwritings. There is no one but the philosopher, satisfied with the\r\nesteem alone of his fellow-citizens, that can raise himself above the\r\nclouds formed by personal interest, and set forth the abuses of\r\ninsidious custom. In short, the liberty of the press will always be\r\nthe measure of civil liberty; and it is a species of thermometer,\r\nwhich shews, at one glance, what a people have lost or gained.\r\n\r\n\"If we adopt this maxim, we are every day losing; for every day the\r\npress is more restricted.\r\n\r\n\"Suffer people to think and speak; the public will judge: they will\r\neven find means to correct authors. The surest method to purify the\r\npress, is to render it free: obstacles irritate it: prohibitions and\r\ndifficulties engender the pamphlets complained of.\r\n\r\n\"Could despotism kill thought in its sanctuary, and prevent us from\r\ncommunicating the essence of our ideas to the mind of our\r\nfellow-creatures, it would do so. But not being able quite to pluck\r\nout the philosopher's tongue, and cut off his hands, it establishes\r\nan inquisition, peoples the frontiers with searchers, spreads\r\nsatellites, and opens every package, in order to interrupt the\r\ninfallible progress of morality and truth. Useless and puerile\r\neffort! Vain attack on the natural right of general society, and on\r\nthe patriotic rights of a particular one! Reason, from day to day,\r\nstrikes nations with a greater lustre, and will at last shine\r\nunclouded. It answers no purpose to fear or persecute genius: nothing\r\nwill extinguish in its hands the torch of truth: the decree which its\r\nmouth pronounces, will be repeated by all posterity against the\r\nunjust man. He wished to snatch from his fellow-creatures the most\r\nnoble of all privileges, that of thinking, which is inseparable from\r\nthat of existing: he will have manifested his weakness and folly; and\r\nhe will merit the twofold reproach of tyranny and impotence.\r\n\r\n\"When a very flat, very atrocious, and very calumniating libel\r\nappears under a fellow's coat, 'tis a contest who shall have it\r\nfirst. People pay an exorbitant price for it; the hawker who cannot\r\nread, and who wishes only to get bread for his poor family, is\r\napprehended, and sent to prison, where he shifts for himself as well\r\nas he can.\r\n\r\n\"The more the libel is prohibited, the more eager we are for it. When\r\nwe have read it, and we see that nothing compensates for its mean\r\ntemerity, we are ashamed to have sought after it. We scarcely dare\r\nsay, _we have read it_: 'tis the scum of low literature, and what is\r\nthere without its scum?\r\n\r\n\"Contempt would be the surest weapon against those miserable\r\nproductions which are equally destitute of truth and talent.\r\n\r\n\"When will men in power know how to disdain equally the interested\r\nencomiums of intriguing flatterers and the satires produced by\r\nhunger?\r\n\r\n\"Besides, those who sit in the first boxes must always expect some\r\nshafts levelled at them by those who are in the pit; this becomes\r\nalmost inevitable. They must needs pay for their more commodious\r\nplace: at least we attribute to those who rule over us more\r\nenjoyments: they have some which they will avow, solely with a view\r\nto raise themselves above the multitude. The human heart is naturally\r\nenvious. Let men in power then forgive or dissemble seasonably:\r\nsatire will fall to the ground; it is by shewing themselves\r\nimpassible, that they will disarm ardent malignity.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, there is a kind of odious libel, which, having every\r\ncharacteristic of calumny, ought to be repressed. This is commonly\r\nnothing more than the fruit of anonymous and envenomed revenge: for\r\nwhat are the secret intrigues of courts to any man of letters? He\r\nwill know time enough that which will suit the pen of history.\r\n\r\n\"A libeller should be punished, as every thing violent ought to be.\r\nBut the parties interested should abstain from pronouncing; for where\r\nthen would be the proportion between the punishment and the crime?\r\n\r\n\"I apply not the name of libels to those atrocious and gratuitous\r\naccusations against the private life of persons in power or\r\nindividuals unconnected with the government. Such injurious and\r\nunmeaning shafts are an attack on honour: their authors should be\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\"The police detected and apprehended one of its inspectors, who,\r\nbeing charged to discover those libels, proposed the composition of\r\nsimilar ones to some half-starved authors. After having laid for them\r\nthis infernal snare for the gain of a little money, he informed\r\nagainst them, and sold them to the government.\r\n\r\n\"These miscreants, blinded by the eager thirst of a little gold,\r\ndivert themselves with the uneasiness of the government, and the more\r\nthey see it in the trances of apprehension, the more they delight in\r\nmagnifying the danger, and doubling its alarms.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty has rendered the English government insensible to libels.\r\nDisdain is certain, before the work is commenced. If the satire is\r\ningenious, people laugh at it, without believing it; if it is flat,\r\nthey despise it.\r\n\r\n\"Why cannot the French government partly adopt this indifference? A\r\ncontempt, more marked, for those vile and unknown pens that endeavour\r\nto wound the sensibility of pride, would disgust the readers of the\r\nflat and lying satires after which they are so eager, only because\r\nthey imagine that the government is really offended by them.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be observed that the productions that flatter more or less\r\npublic malignity, spread in fugitive sparks a central fire, which, if\r\ncompressed, would, perhaps, produce an explosion.\r\n\r\n\"Magistrates have not yet been seen disdaining those obscure shafts,\r\nrendering themselves invulnerable from the openness of their\r\nproceedings, and considering that praise will be mute, as long as\r\ncriticism cannot freely raise its voice.\r\n\r\n\"Let them then punish the flattery by which they are assailed, since\r\nthey are so much afraid of the libel that always contains some good\r\ntruths: besides, the public are there to judge the detractor; and no\r\nunjust satire ever circulated a fort-night, without being branded\r\nwith contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Ministers reciprocally deceive each other when they are attacked in\r\nthis manner; the one laughs at the storm which has just burst on the\r\nother, and promotes secretly what he appears to prosecute openly and\r\nwith warmth. It would be a curious thing if one could bring to light\r\nthe good tricks which the votaries of ambition play each other in the\r\nroad to power and fortune.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing now printed in Paris, in the line of politics and\r\nhistory, but satires and falsehoods. Foreigners look down with pity\r\non every thing that emanates from the capital on these matters. Other\r\nsubjects begin to feel the consequences of this, because the\r\nrestraint laid on the mind is manifested even in books of simple\r\namusement. The presses of Paris are no longer to serve but for\r\nposting-bills, and invitations to funerals and weddings. Almanacks\r\nare already a subject too elevated, and the inquisition examines and\r\ngarbles them.\r\n\r\n\"When I see a book,\" says MERCIER, \"sanctioned by the government, I\r\nwould lay a wager, without opening it, that this book contains\r\npolitical falsehoods. The chief magistrate may well say: 'This piece\r\nof paper shall be worth a thousand francs;' but he cannot say: 'Let\r\nthis error become truth,' or, 'let this truth no longer be anything\r\nbut an error.' He may say it, but he can never compel men's minds to\r\nadopt it.\r\n\r\n\"What is admirable in printing, is that these fine works, which do\r\nhonour to human genius, are not to be commanded or paid for; on the\r\ncontrary, it is the natural liberty of a generous mind, which unfolds\r\nitself in spite of dangers, and makes a present to human nature, in\r\nspite of tyrants. This is what renders the man of letters so\r\ncommendable, and insures to him the gratitude of future ages.\r\n\r\n\"O! worthy Englishmen! generous people, strangers to our shameful\r\nservitude, carefully preserve among you the liberty of the press: it\r\nis the pledge of your freedom. At this day, you alone are the\r\nrepresentatives of nearly all mankind; you uphold the dignity of the\r\nname of man. The thunderbolts, which strike the pride and insolence\r\nof arbitrary power, issue from your happy island. Human reason has\r\nfound among you an asylum whence she may instruct the world. Your\r\nbooks are not subject to an inquisition; and it would require a long\r\ncomment to explain to you in what manner permission is at length\r\nobtained for a flimsy pamphlet, which no one will read, to be exposed\r\nfor sale, and remain unsold, on the _Quai de Gévres_.\r\n\r\n\"We are so absurd and so little in comparison to you,\" adds MERCIER,\r\n\"that you would be at a loss to conceive the excess of our weakness\r\nand humiliation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 9, 1802._\r\n\r\nAmong the national establishments in this metropolis, I know of none\r\nthat have experienced so great an amelioration, since the revolution,\r\nas the\r\n\r\nHOSPITALS AND OTHER CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS;\r\n\r\nThe civil hospitals in Paris now form two distinct classes. The one\r\ncomprehends the hospitals for the sick: the other, those for the\r\nindigent. The former are devoted to the relief of suffering human\r\nnature; the latter serve as an asylum to children, to the infirm, and\r\nto the aged indigent. All persons who are not ill enough to be\r\nadmitted of necessity into the hospital the nearest to their\r\nresidence, are obliged to present themselves to the _Bureau Central\r\nd'Admissions_. Here they are examined, and if there be occasion, they\r\nreceive a ticket of admission for the hospital where their particular\r\ndisorder is treated. At the head of the hospitals for the sick stands\r\nthat so long known by the appellation of the\r\n\r\nHÔTEL-DIEU.\r\n\r\nFormerly, nothing more horrid could be conceived than the spectacle\r\npresented in this asylum for the afflicted. It was rather a\r\ncharnel-house than an hospital; and the name of the Creator, over\r\nthe gate, which recalled to mind the principle of all existence,\r\nserved only to decorate the entrance of the tomb of the living.\r\n\r\nThe _Hôtel-Dieu_, which is situated in the _Parvis Notre-Dame_, _Ile\r\ndu Palais_, was founded as far back as the year 660 by St. Landry,\r\nfor the reception of the sick and maimed of both sexes, without any\r\nexception of persons. Jews, Turks, infidels, pagans, protestants, and\r\ncatholics were alike admitted, without form or recommendation. Yet,\r\nthough it contained but 1200 beds, and the number of patients very\r\noften exceeded 5000, and, on an average, was never less than 2500,\r\ntill the year 1786, no steps were taken for enlarging the hospital,\r\nor providing elsewhere for those who could not be conveniently\r\naccommodated in it. The dead were removed from the wards only on\r\nvisits made at a fixed time; so that it happened not unfrequently\r\nthat a poor helpless patient was compelled to remain for hours wedged\r\nin between two corpses. The air or the neighbourhood was contaminated\r\nby the noisome exhalations continually arising from this abode of\r\npestilence, and that which was breathed within the walls of the\r\nhospital was so contagious, as to turn a trifling complaint into a\r\ndangerous disorder, and a simple wound into a mortification.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, the attention of the government being called to this serious\r\nevil by various memoirs, the _Academy of Sciences_ was directed to\r\ninvestigate the truth of the bold assertions made in these\r\npublications. A commission was appointed; but as the revenues of the\r\n_Hôtel-Dieu_ were immense, for a long time it was impossible to\r\nobtain from the Governors any account of their application. However,\r\nthe Commissioners, directing their attention to the principal object,\r\nreported as follows: \"We first compared the _Hôtel-Dieu_ and the\r\n_Hôpital de la Charité_ relative to their mortality. In 52 years, the\r\n_Hôtel-Dieu_, out of 1,108,741 patients lost 244,720, which is one\r\nout of four and a half. _La Charité_, where but one dies out of seven\r\nand a half, would have lost only 168,700, whence results the\r\nfrightful picture that the _Hôtel-Dieu_, in 52 years, has snatched\r\nfrom France 99,044 persons, whose lives would have been saved, had\r\nthe _Hôtel-Dieu_ been as spacious, in proportion, as _La Charité_.\r\nThe loss in these 52 years answers to 1906 deaths per year, and that\r\nis nearly the tenth part of the total and annual loss of Paris. The\r\npreservation of this hospital in the site it now occupies, and on its\r\npresent plan, therefore produces the same effect as a sort of plague\r\nwhich constantly desolates the capital.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this report, the hospital was enlarged so as to\r\ncontain about 2000 beds. Since the revolution, the improvements\r\nintroduced into the interior government of the _Hotel-Dieu_ have been\r\ngreat and rapid. Each patient now has a bed to himself. Those\r\nattacked by contagious disorders are transferred to the _Hospice St.\r\nLouis_. Insane persons are no longer admitted; men, thus afflicted,\r\nare sent to a special hospital established at _Charenton_; and women,\r\nto the _Salpétrière_. Nor are any females longer received into the\r\n_Hôtel-Dieu_ to lie-in; an hospital having been established for the\r\nreception of pregnant women. At the _Hôtel-Dieu_, every method has\r\nbeen put in practice to promote the circulation of air, and expel the\r\ninsalubrious miasmata. One of these, I think, well deserves to be\r\nadopted in England.\r\n\r\nIn the French hospitals, one ward at least is now always kept empty.\r\nThe moment it becomes so by the removal of the patients into another,\r\nthe walls are whitewashed, and the air is purified by the fumigation\r\nwith muriatic acid, according to the plan first proposed by\r\nGUYTON-MORVEAU. This operation is alternately performed in each\r\nward in succession; that which has been the longest occupied being\r\npurified the first, and left empty till it is again wanted.\r\n\r\nThe number of hospitals in Paris has been considerably augmented.\r\nThey are all supported by the government, and not, like those in\r\nEngland, by private benefactions. Sick children of both sexes, from\r\nthe time of suckling to the age of sixteen, are no longer admitted\r\ninto the different hospitals; but are received into a special\r\nhospital, extremely well arranged, and in a fine, airy situation,\r\nbeyond the _Barrière de Sèvres_. Two institutions have been formed\r\nfor the aged, infirm and indigent, who pay, on entrance, a moderate\r\nsum. One of these charities is without the _Barrière d'Enfer_; the\r\nother, in the _Faubourg St. Martin_. In the same _faubourg_, a\r\n_Maison de Santé_ is established, where the sick are treated on\r\npaying thirty _sous_ a day.\r\n\r\nAn hospital for gratuitous vaccination, founded by the Prefect of the\r\ndepartment of La Seine, is now open for the continual treatment of\r\nthe cow-pox, and the distribution of the matter to all parts of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn general, the charitable institutions in Paris have also undergone\r\nvery considerable improvements since the revolution; for instance,\r\nthe male orphans, admitted, to the number of two thousand, into the\r\nasylum formerly called _La Pitié_, in the _Faubourg St. Victor_, used\r\nto remain idle. They were employed only to follow funeral\r\nprocessions. At present, they are kept at work, and instructed in\r\nsome useful trade.\r\n\r\nA new institution for female orphans has been established in the\r\n_Faubourg St. Antoine_; for, here, the two sexes are not at present\r\nreceived into the same house, whether hospital or other charitable\r\ninstitution. In consequence of which, Paris now contains two\r\nreceptacles for _Incurables_, in lieu of the one which formerly\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThe place of the _Hôpital des Enfans-Trouvés_ is also supplied by an\r\nestablishment, on a large scale, called the\r\n\r\nHOSPICE DE LA MATERNITÉ.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two branches, each of which occupies a separate\r\nhouse. The one for foundlings, in the _Rue de la Bourbe_, is intended\r\nfor the reception of children abandoned by their parents. Here they\r\nare reared, if not sent into the country to be suckled. The other, in\r\nthe _Rue d'Enfer_, which may be considered as the General Lying-in\r\nHospital of Paris, is destined for the reception of pregnant women.\r\nUpwards of 1500 are here delivered every year.\r\n\r\nAs formerly, no formality is now required for the admission of\r\nnew-born infants. In the old Foundling-Hospital, the number annually\r\nreceived exceeded 8000. It is not near so great at present. To those\r\nwho reflect on the ravages made among the human race by war, during\r\nwhich disease sweeps off many more than are killed in battle, it is a\r\nmost interesting sight to behold fifty or sixty little foundlings\r\nassembled in one ward, where they are carefully fed till they are\r\nprovided with wet nurses.\r\n\r\nI must here correct a mistake into which I have been betrayed, in my\r\nletter of the 26th of December, respecting the present destination of\r\n\r\nLA SALPÊTRIÈRE.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer used as a house of correction for dissolute women.\r\nProstitutes, taken up by the police, are now carried to St. Lazare,\r\nin the _Rue St. Denis_. Those in want of medical aid, for disorders\r\nincident to their course of life, are not sent to _Bicêtre, but to\r\nthe _ci-devant_ monastery of the Capucins, in the _Rue Caumartin_.\r\n\r\nAt present, the _Salpêtrière forms an _hospice_ for the reception of\r\nindigent or infirm old women, and young girls, brought up in the\r\nFoundling-Hospital, are placed here to be instructed in needle-work\r\nand making lace. Female idiots and mad women are also taken care of\r\nin a particular part of this very extensive building.\r\n\r\nThe Salpêtrière was erected by Lewis XIII, and founded as an\r\nhospital, by Lewis XIV, in 1656. The facade has a majestic\r\nappearance. Before the revolution, this edifice was said to lodge\r\n6000 souls, and even now, it cannot contain less than 4000. By the\r\n_Plan of Paris_, you will see its situation, to the south-east of the\r\n_Jardin des Plantes_.\r\n\r\nI shall also avail myself of the opportunity of correcting another\r\nmistake concerning\r\n\r\nBICÊTRE.\r\n\r\nThis place has now the same destination for men that the Salpétrière\r\nhas for women. There is a particular hospital, lately established,\r\nfor male venereal patients, in the _Rue du Faubourg St. Jacques_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_March 9, in continuation._\r\n\r\nPreviously to the decree of the 19th of August 1792, which suppressed\r\nthe universities and other scientific institutions, there existed in\r\nFrance Faculties and Colleges of Physicians, as well as Colleges and\r\nCommonalities of Surgeons. From one of those unaccountable\r\ncontradictions of which the revolution affords so many instances,\r\nthese were also suppressed at a time when they were becoming most\r\nnecessary for supplying the French armies with medical men. But as\r\nsoon as the fury of the revolutionary storm began to abate, the\r\nre-establishment of Schools of Medicine was one of the first objects\r\nthat engaged attention.\r\n\r\nTill these latter times, Medicine and Surgery, separated from each\r\nother, mutually contended for pre-eminence. Each had its forms and\r\nparticular schools. They seemed to have divided between them\r\nsuffering human nature, instead of uniting for its relief. On both\r\nsides, men of merit despised such useless distinctions; they felt\r\nthat the curative art ought to comprehend all the knowledge and all\r\nthe means that can conduce to its success; but these elevated ideas\r\nwere combated by narrow minds, which, not being capable of embracing\r\ngeneral considerations, always attach to details a great importance.\r\nThe revolution terminated these disputes, by involving both parties\r\nin the same misfortunes.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the re-establishment of Public Instruction, the\r\n\r\n_Schools of Health_, founded at Paris, Montpelier, and Strasburg, on\r\nplans digested by men the most enlightened, presented a complete body\r\nof instruction relative to every branch of the curative art. Physics\r\nand chemistry, which form the basis of that art, were naturally\r\nincluded, and nothing that could contribute to its perfection, in the\r\npresent state of the sciences, was forgotten. The plan of instruction\r\nis fundamentally the same in all these schools; but is more extensive\r\nin the principal one, that is, in the\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nThis very striking monument of modern architecture, situated in the\r\n_Faubourg St. Germain_, owes its erection to the partiality which\r\nLewis XV entertained for the art of surgery. That monarch preferred\r\nit to every science; he was fond of conversing on it, and took such\r\nan interest in it, that, in order to promote its improvement, he\r\nbuilt this handsome edifice for the _ci-devant Académie et Écoles de\r\nChirurgie_. The architect was GONDOUIN.\r\n\r\nThe façade, extending nearly two hundred feet, presents a peristyle\r\nof the Ionic order. The interior distribution of this building\r\ncorresponds with the elegance of its exterior. It contains a valuable\r\nlibrary, a cabinet of anatomical preparations (among which is a\r\nskeleton that presents a rare instance of a general _anchilosis_) and\r\nimitations in wax, a chemical laboratory, a vast collection of\r\nchirurgical and philosophical instruments, and a magnificent\r\namphitheatre, the first stone of which was laid by Lewis XVI in\r\nDecember 1774. This lecture-room will conveniently hold twelve\r\nhundred persons, and its form and arrangement are such, that a pupil\r\nseated the farthest from the subject under dissection, can see all\r\nthe demonstrations of the Professor as well as if placed near the\r\nmarble table.\r\n\r\nIn one wing of the building is an _Hospice de Perfectionnement_,\r\nformerly instituted for the reception of rare chirurgical cases only;\r\nbut into which other patients, labouring under internal disorders of\r\nan extraordinary nature, are now likewise admitted.\r\n\r\nTo this school are attached from twenty to thirty Professors, who\r\nlecture on anatomy and physiology; medical chemistry and pharmacy;\r\nmedical physics; pathology, internal and external; natural history,\r\nas connected with medicine, and botany; operative medicine; external\r\nand internal clinical cases, and the modern improvements in treating\r\nthem; midwifery, and all disorders incident to women; the physical\r\neducation of children; the history of medicine, and its legitimate\r\npractice; the doctrine of Hippocrates, and history of rare cases;\r\nmedical bibliography, and the demonstration of the use of drugs and\r\nchirurgical instruments. There are also a chief anatomist, a painter,\r\nand a modeller in wax. The lectures are open to the public as well as\r\nto the students, who are said to exceed a thousand. Besides this part\r\nof instruction, the pupils practise anatomical, chirurgical, and\r\nchemical operations. To the number of one hundred and twenty, they\r\nform a practical school, divided into three classes, and are\r\nsuccessively distributed into three of the clinical hospitals in\r\nParis. At an annual competition, prizes are awarded to the greatest\r\nproficients.\r\n\r\nAlthough this school is so numerously attended, and has produced\r\nseveral skilful professors, celebrated anatomists, and a multitude of\r\ndistinguished pupils, yet it appears that, since there has been no\r\nregular admission for physicians and surgeons, the most complete\r\nanarchy has prevailed in the medical line. The towns and villages in\r\nFrance are overrun by quacks, who deal out poison and death with an\r\naudacity which the existing laws are unable to check. Under the title\r\nof _Officiers de Santé_, they impose on the credulity of the public,\r\nin the most dangerous manner, by the distribution of nostrums for\r\nevery disorder. To put a stop to this alarming evil, it is in\r\ncontemplation to promulgate a law, enacting that no one shall in\r\nfuture practise in France as a physician or surgeon, without having\r\nbeen examined and received into one of the six Special Schools of\r\nMedicine, or as an officer of health, without having studied a\r\ncertain number of years, walked the hospitals, and also passed a\r\nregular examination.[1]\r\n\r\nAt the medical school of Paris are held the meetings of the\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nIt was instituted for the purpose of continuing the labours of the\r\n_ci-devant_ Royal Society of Medicine and the old Academy of Surgery.\r\nWith this view, it is charged to keep up a correspondence, not only\r\nwith the medical men resident within the limits of the Republic, but\r\nalso with those of foreign countries, respecting every object that\r\ncan tend to the progress of the art of healing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1777, there existed in Paris a college of\r\nPharmacy. The apothecaries, composing this college, had formed, at\r\ntheir own expense, an establishment for instruction relative to the\r\ncurative art, in their laboratory and garden in the _Rue de\r\nl'Arbalêtre_. Since the revolution, the acknowledged utility of this\r\ninstitution has caused it to be maintained under the title of the\r\n\r\nGRATUITOUS SCHOOL OF PHARMACY.\r\n\r\nHere are delivered _gratis_, by two professors in each department,\r\npublic lectures on pharmaceutic chemistry, pharmaceutic natural\r\nhistory, and botany. When the courses are finished, prizes are\r\nannually distributed to the pupils who distinguish themselves most by\r\ntheir talents and knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796, the apothecaries of Paris, animated by a desire to\r\nrender this establishment still more useful, formed themselves into a\r\nsociety, by the name of the\r\n\r\nFREE SOCIETY OF APOTHECARIES.\r\n\r\nIts object is to contribute to the progress of the arts and sciences,\r\nparticularly pharmacy, chemistry, botany, and natural history. This\r\nsociety admits, as free and corresponding associates, _savans_ of all\r\nthe other departments of France and of foreign countries, who\r\ncultivate those sciences and others analogous to them. Some of the\r\nmost enlightened men in France are to be found among its members.\r\n\r\nThe advantageous changes made in the teaching of medicine, since the\r\nrevolution, appear to consist chiefly in the establishment of\r\nclinical lectures. The teaching of the sciences, accessory to\r\nmedicine, partakes more or less advantageously of the great progress\r\nmade in that of chemistry. It seems that, in general, the students in\r\nmedicine grant but a very limited confidence to accredited opinions,\r\nand that they recur to observation and experience much more than they\r\ndid formerly. As for the changes which have occurred in the practice\r\nof medicine, I think it would be no easy matter to appreciate them\r\nwith any degree of exactness. Besides, sufficient time has not yet\r\nelapsed since the establishment of the new mode of teaching, for them\r\nto assume a marked complexion. It is, however, to be observed that,\r\nby the death of the celebrated DÉSAULT, Surgery has sustained a loss\r\nwhich is not yet repaired, nor will be perhaps for ages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A law to this effect is now made.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 12, 1802._\r\n\r\nFrom the account I have given you of the Public Schools here, you\r\nwill have perceived that, since the revolution, nothing has been\r\nneglected which could contribute to the mental improvement of the\r\nmale part of the rising generation. But as some parents are averse to\r\nsending their children to these National Schools, there are now\r\nestablished in Paris a great number of\r\n\r\nPRIVATE SEMINARIES FOR YOUTH OF BOTH SEXES.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these are far superior to any that previously existed in\r\nFrance, and are really of a nature to excite admiration, when we\r\nconsider the cruel divisions which have distracted this country. But\r\nit seems that if, for a time, instruction, both public and private,\r\nwas suspended, no sooner were the French permitted to breathe than a\r\nsudden and salutary emulation arose among those who devoted\r\nthemselves to the important task of conducting these private schools.\r\nThe great advantage which they appear to me to have over\r\nestablishments of a similar description in England, is that the\r\nscholars are perfectly grounded in whatever they are taught; the want\r\nof which, among us, occasions many a youth to forget the greater part\r\nof what he has learned long before he has attained the years of\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nIf several of the schools for boys here are extremely well conducted,\r\nsome of those for girls appear to be governed with no less care and\r\njudgment. In order to be enabled to form an opinion on the present\r\nmode of bringing up young girls in France, I have made a point of\r\ninvestigating the subject. I shall, in consequence, endeavour to shew\r\nyou the contrast which strikes me to have occurred here in\r\n\r\nFEMALE EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nIn France, convents had, at all times, prior to the revolution,\r\nenjoyed the exclusive privilege of bringing up young women; and some\r\nfamilies had, for a century past, preserved the habit of sending all\r\ntheir daughters to be St. Ursulas, in order to enter afterwards into\r\nthe world as virtuous wives and tender mothers. The natural result\r\nwas, that, if the principles of excessive piety which had been\r\ncommunicated to them remained deeply engraved in their heart, they\r\nemployed the whole day in the duties required by the catholic\r\nreligion; and the confessor who dictated all these habitual\r\npractices, not unfrequently became the director of the temporal\r\nconcerns of the family, as well as the spiritual. If the young girls,\r\nin emerging from the cells of a convent, were disposed to lay aside\r\ntheir religious practices, in order to adopt the customs and\r\npleasures of the world, this sudden transition, from one extreme to\r\nthe other, made them at once abandon, not only the puerile minutiæ,\r\nbut also the sacred principles of religion. There was no medium. They\r\neither became outrageous devotees, and, neglecting the respectable\r\nduties of housewives and mistresses of a family, wrapped themselves\r\nup in a great hood, and were incessantly on their knees before the\r\naltars of the churches, or, on the other hand, rushed into\r\nextravagance and dissipation, and, likewise, deserting a family which\r\nclaimed their care, dishonoured themselves by the licentiousness of\r\ntheir manners.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, many women of good abilities and character,\r\ndeprived of their property by the vicissitudes of the revolution,\r\nhave established, in Paris and its environs, seminaries, where young\r\ngirls receive such advice as is most useful to females who are\r\ndestined to live in the world, and acquirements, which, by employing\r\nthem agreeably several hours in the day, contribute to the interior\r\nhappiness of their family, and make them find charms in a domestic\r\nlife. In short, the superiority of female education in France is\r\ndecidedly in favour of the present system, whether considered in\r\nregard to mental improvement, health, or beauty. With respect to the\r\nmorals inculcated in these modern French boarding schools, the best\r\nanswer to all the prejudices might be entertained against them, is\r\nthat the men, who have married women there educated, find that they\r\nprove excellent wives, and that their accomplishments serve only to\r\nembellish their virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 14, 1802_.\r\n\r\nI plead guilty to your censure in not having yet furnished you with\r\nany remarks on the origin of this capital; but you will recollect\r\nthat I engaged only to give you a mere sketch; indeed, it would\r\nrequire more time and talent than I can command to present you with a\r\nfinished picture. I speak of things just as they happen to occur to\r\nmy mind; and provided my letters bring you acquainted with such\r\nobjects here as are most deserving of attention, my purpose will be\r\nfully accomplished. However, in compliance with your pressing\r\nrequest, I shall now briefly retrace the\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE AGGRANDISEMENT OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nWithout hazarding any vague conjectures, I may, I think, safely\r\naffirm that Cæsar is the first historian who makes mention of this\r\ncity. In the seventh book of his Commentaries, that conqueror relates\r\nthat he sent his lieutenant Labienus towards Lutetia; this was the\r\nname given by the Gauls to the capital of the Parisii. It was then\r\nentirely contained within that island on the Seine, which, at the\r\npresent day, is called _l'Ile du Palais_.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the capitals of the other provinces of Gaul,\r\n_Lutetia_ was but a sorry village; its houses were small, of a round\r\nform, built of wood and earth, and covered with straw and reeds.\r\n\r\nAfter having conquered _Lutetia_, the Romans embellished it with a\r\npalace, surrounded it by walls, and erected, at the head of each of\r\nthe two bridges leading to it, a fortress, one of which stood on the\r\nsite of the prison called _Le Grand Châtelet_; and the other, on that\r\nof _Le Petit Châtelet_. The Yonne, the Marne, and the Oise, being\r\nrivers which join the Seine, suggested the idea of establishing a\r\ntrading company by water, in order to facilitate, by those channels,\r\nthe circulation of warlike stores and provisions. These merchants\r\nwere called _Nautæ Parisiaci_. The Romans also erected, near the left\r\nbank of the Seine, a magnificent palace and an aqueduct. This palace\r\nwas called _Thermæ_, on account of its tepid baths.\r\n\r\nJulian, being charged to defend Gaul against the irruptions of the\r\nbarbarians, took up his residence in these _Thermæ_ in 360, two years\r\nbefore he was proclaimed emperor, in the square which was in front of\r\nthis palace. \"I was in winter-quarters in my dear _Lutetia_,\" says he\r\nin his _Misopogon_. \"Thus is named, in Gaul, the little capital of\r\nthe Parisii.\"--\"It occupies,\" observes Abbon, \"an inconsiderable\r\nisland, surrounded by walls, the foot of which is bathed by the\r\nriver. The entrance to it, on each side, is by a wooden bridge.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the fifth century, this city passed from the\r\ndominion of the Romans to that of the Francs. It was besieged by\r\nChilderic I. In 508, Clovis declared it the capital of his kingdom.\r\nThe long stay which that prince made in it, contributed to its\r\nembellishment. Charlemagne founded in it a celebrated school. A\r\nlittle time after, another was established in the abbey of _St.\r\nGermain-des-Prés_. In the course of the ninth century, it was\r\nbesieged and pillaged three times by the Normans.\r\n\r\nPhilip Augustus surrounded Paris with walls, and comprised in that\r\ninclosure a great number of small towns and hamlets in its vicinity.\r\nThis undertaking occupied twenty years, having been begun in 1190,\r\nand finished in 1211. The same king was also the first who caused the\r\nstreets of this city to be paved. The wars of the English required\r\nnew fortifications; and, under king John, ditches were dug round the\r\ncity; and the _Bastille_, erected. These works were continued during\r\nthe reigns of Charles V and Charles VI.\r\n\r\nFrancis I, the restorer of literature and of the arts, neglected\r\nnothing that might conduce to the farther embellishment of this\r\ncapital. He caused several new streets to be made, many Gothic\r\nedifices to be pulled down, and was, in France, the first who revived\r\nGreek architecture, the remains of which, buried by the hand of time,\r\nor mutilated by that of barbarians, being collected and compared at\r\nRome, began to improve the genius of celebrated artists, and, in the\r\nsequel, led to the production of masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThe kings, his successors, executed a part of the projects of that\r\nprince, and this extensive city imperceptibly lost its irregular and\r\nGothic aspect. The removal of the houses, which, not long since,\r\nencumbered the bridges, and intercepted the current of air, has\r\ndiffused cheerfulness and salubrity.\r\n\r\nYou will pardon me, I trust, if I here make a retrograde movement,\r\nnot to recapitulate the aggrandisement of Paris, but to retrace\r\nrapidly the progressive amelioration of the manners of its\r\ninhabitants. The latter paved the way to the former.\r\n\r\nUnder the first kings of France of the third race, justice was\r\nadministered in a summary way; the king, the count, and the viscount\r\nheard the parties, and gave a prompt sentence, or else left the\r\ncontroversy to be decided by a pitched battle, if it was of too\r\nintricate a nature. No colleges then existed here; the clergy only\r\nkeeping schools near the Cathedral of _Notre-Dame_ for those who were\r\nintended for holy orders. The nobles piqued themselves on extreme\r\nignorance, and as many of them could not even sign their own name,\r\nthey dipped their glove in ink, and stamped it on the parchment as\r\ntheir signature. They lived on their estates, and if they were\r\nobliged to pass three or four days in town, they affected to appear\r\nalways in boots, in order that they might not be taken for _vassals_.\r\nTen men were sufficient for the collection of all the taxes. There\r\nwere no more than two gates to the city; and under Lewis surnamed _le\r\nGros_, from his corpulency, the duties at the north gate produced no\r\nmore than twelve francs a year.\r\n\r\nPhilip Augustus, being fond of literature, welcomed and protected men\r\nof learning. It had appeared to revive under Charlemagne; but the\r\nravages of the Normans occasioned it to sink again into oblivion till\r\nthe reign of Lewis the Young, father of Philip Augustus. Under the\r\nlatter, the schools of Paris became celebrated; they were resorted\r\nto, not only from the distant provinces, but from foreign countries.\r\nThe quarter, till lately called _l'Université_, became peopled; and,\r\nin the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was covered by colleges\r\nand monasteries. Philip the Fair rendered the Parliament sedentary.\r\nHe prohibited duelling in civil contentions; and a person might have\r\nrecourse to a court of justice, without being under the necessity of\r\nfighting. Anne de Bretagne, great and majestic in every thing, was\r\ndesirous of having a court. Ladies who, till then, were born in one\r\ncastle only to marry and die in another, came to Paris. They were\r\nunwilling to leave it, and men followed them thither. All these\r\ncircumstances increased its inhabitants to a thirtieth part beyond\r\ntheir former number.\r\n\r\nThe wars of religion under Charles IX and Henry III rendered gold and\r\nsilver a little more common, by the profanations of the Calvinists,\r\nwho pillaged the churches, and converted into specie the sacred\r\nvases, as well as the shrines and statues of saints. The vast sums of\r\nmoney which the court of Spain lavished in Paris, to support the\r\nLeague, had also diffused a certain degree of affluence among no\r\ninconsiderable number of citizens; and it is to be remarked that,\r\nunder Henry IV, several handsome streets were finished in less than a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHenry IV was the first of the kings of France who embellished Paris\r\nwith regular squares, or open spaces, decorated with the different\r\norders of architecture. After having nearly finished the _Pont Neuf_,\r\nhe built the _Place Royale_, now called _Place des Fédérés_, and also\r\nthe _Place Dauphine_.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the administration of Cardinal Richelieu, there no\r\nlonger existed in France more than one master; and the petty tyrants\r\nin the provinces, who had fortified themselves so long in their\r\ncastles against the royal authority, were seen to come to court, to\r\nsolicit the most paltry lodging with all the servility of courtiers,\r\nand at the same time erect mansions in town with all the splendour of\r\nmen inflated by pride and power. At last came the reign of Lewis XIV,\r\nand presently Paris knew no limits. Its gates were converted into\r\narcs of triumph, and its ditches, being filled up and planted with\r\ntrees, became public walks. When one considers the character of that\r\nmonarch, it should seem that Paris ought to have been more\r\nembellished under his reign. In fact, had Lewis XIV expended on Paris\r\none-fourth part of the money which he lavished on Versailles,[1] it\r\nwould have become the most astonishing city in Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, its great extent and population, magnificent edifices,\r\ncelebrated national establishments of learning and science, rich\r\nlibraries, curious cabinets, where lessons of knowledge and genius\r\npresent themselves to those who have a taste for them, together with\r\nits theatres and other places of public entertainment, have long\r\nrendered Paris deserving of the admiration of enlightened nations.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, Paris contained 46 parish churches, and 20\r\nothers answering the same purpose, 11 abbeys, and 133 monasteries or\r\nconvents of men and women, 13 colleges, 15 public seminaries, and 26\r\nhospitals. To these must be added the three royal habitations, the\r\n_Louvre_, the _Tuileries_, and the _Luxembourg_, also the _Hôtel des\r\nInvalides_, the _Palais Royal_, the _Palais Bourbon_, and a great\r\nnumber of magnificent hotels, inhabited by titled or wealthy persons.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution, several of these buildings have been destroyed;\r\nalmost all the monasteries and convents, together with the churches\r\nbelonging to them, have been sold as national property, and either\r\ndemolished for the sake of the materials, or converted to different\r\nuses. Fifteen principal churches, besides the _Pantheon_, the\r\n_Invalides_, _Val-de-Grace_, the _Sorbonne_, and a few others, were\r\npreserved as national temples, intended for the celebration of\r\n_decadary fétes_, and for a time rendered common to every sort of\r\nworship. Most of the old churches were of Gothic architecture, and\r\nnot much to be commended with respect to art; but several of them\r\nwere models of boldness, from the lightness of their construction.\r\n\r\nThe colleges, as I have before observed, are replaced by public\r\nschools and private seminaries of every description. The number of\r\nthe houses in Paris, many of which are from five to eight stories in\r\nheight, has been estimated at upwards of 80,000. The number of its\r\ninhabitants appears to have been over-rated. By an official\r\nstatement, in which foreigners are not included, it contains no more\r\nthan 630,000 souls.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year of the republican era, the number of males born\r\nin Paris was 9296; and that of females, 9177; making the general\r\ntotal of births 18,473, of which the males, born out of wedlock,\r\namounted to 1792; and the females, to 1852. The number of persons\r\ndeceased, within the same period, was 10,446 males, and 10,301\r\nfemales; making together 20,747. The annual decrease in population\r\nwas consequently 2274 souls. The number of marriages was 3826; and\r\nthat of divorces, 720; which is nearly 2 out of 11.\r\n\r\nThe ancient division of Paris consisted of three parts; namely, _La\r\nCité_, _l'Université_, and _La Ville_. _La Cite_ comprised all the\r\n_Ile du Palais_. This is the parent-stock of the capital, whence have\r\nextended, like so many branches, the numerous quarters by which it is\r\nsurrounded. _L'Université_ was bordered by the Seine, the _Faubourg\r\nSt. Bernard_, _St. Victor_, _St. Marcel_, _St. Jacques_, and the\r\n_Faubourg St. Germain_. The number of colleges in this quarter, had\r\nobtained it the name of _Le Pays Latin_. _La Ville_ comprehended all\r\nthe rest of the capital, not included in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nAt present, Paris is divided into twelve mayoralties (as you will see\r\nby the _Plan_), each of which is presided by a central office of\r\nmunicipal police. The _Faubourgs_ retain their ancient names; but\r\nthose of many of the streets have been changed in the course of the\r\nrevolution. The _Chaussée d'Antin_, which comprises the new streets\r\nnorth of the _Boulevard Italien_, is now the most fashionable part of\r\nthe town. The houses here are chiefly inhabited by bankers and\r\npersons living in affluence; and apartments in this neighbourhood are\r\nconsiderably dearer than in the _Faubourg St. Germain_, which,\r\ncomparatively speaking, is deserted.\r\n\r\nI have already described the _Porte St. Denis_ and the _Porte St.\r\nMartin_, which are nothing more than arcs of triumph. In proportion\r\nas the limits of the capital became extended, the real gates were\r\nremoved, but reappeared under the name of _barrières_. These costly\r\nedifices were constructed during the ministry of CALONNE, under the\r\ndirection of LEDOUX, the architect, who has taken a pleasure in\r\nvarying their form and character. One represents an observatory;\r\nanother, a chapel; some have the appearance of rusticated buildings;\r\nothers, that of temples. Under the old _régime_ too, the\r\nfarmers-general had inclosed Paris with a high wall, the extent of\r\nwhich has been estimated at upwards of 10,000 toises. This wall\r\ndispleased the eye of the Parisians, and, when they were out of\r\nhumour, induced them to murmur loudly. Whence the following\r\n_jeu de mots_:\r\n\r\n  _\"Le mur, murant Paris, rend Paris murmurout.\"_\r\n\r\nDuring the revolution, it was by no means uncommon to shut the\r\n_barrières_, in order to serve the purposes of party, and favour the\r\narrest of particular persons. To the number of sixty, they are placed\r\nat the principal outlets of the suburbs, and occupied by custom-house\r\nofficers, whose business is to collect duties, and watch that no\r\ncontraband goods find their way into the city. Formerly, when every\r\ncarriage entering Paris was stopped and examined (which is not the\r\ncase at present), the self-importance of these _commis des barrières_\r\ncould be equalled only by their ignorance.\r\n\r\nA traveller arriving from Egypt brought with him a mummy. The case\r\nbeing long, he chose not to fasten it on to his post-chaise, but sent\r\nit to Paris by water. When it was landed at the _barrière_, the\r\ncustom-house officers opened it, and, finding it to contain a\r\nblack-looking body, decided that this was a man who had been baked\r\nin an oven. They took the linen bandages for his burnt shirt, and,\r\nafter drawing up a _procès-verbal_ in due form, sent the mummy to\r\nthe _Morne_, where dead bodies are exposed in order to be owned.\r\nWhen the proprietor reached Paris, he went to the _barrière_ to\r\nclaim his mummy. The _commis_ listened to him and stared at him with\r\nastonishment. He grew angry, and at length broke out into a violent\r\npassion; when one of the searchers, in a whisper, advised him to\r\ndecamp, if he wished to avoid the gallows. The traveller, stupified,\r\nwas obliged to apply to the Minister of the Police, and, with some\r\ndifficulty, recovered from the _Morne_ his Egyptian prince or\r\nprincess, who, after having been preserved 2000 years, was on the\r\npoint of being buried in a catholic cemetery, instead of figuring in\r\na cabinet of curiosities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The article of lead alone for the water-pipes cost\r\nthirty-two millions of livres or £1,333,333 sterling; but\r\n\r\n  \"Rich in her weeping country's spoils, Versailles!\r\n  May boast a thousand fountains, that can cast\r\n  The tortur'd waters to the distant heav'ns\"--]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 17, 1802._\r\n\r\nAn object which must infallibly strike the eye of the attentive\r\nobserver, who has not visited this capital within the last ten years,g\r\nis the change in the style of\r\n\r\nFRENCH FURNITURE.\r\n\r\nThis remark may, at first sight, appear trivial; but a second view of\r\nthe subject will produce reflections on the frivolity of this people,\r\neven amidst their intestine commotions, and at the same time shew\r\nthat they are, in no small degree, indebted to the influence of those\r\nevents for the taste which is to be distinguished in the new\r\nproductions of their industry, and, in general, for the progress they\r\nhave made, not only in the mechanical arts, but also in the sciences\r\nof every description. This will appear the more extraordinary, as it\r\nshould seem natural to presume that the persecution which the\r\nprotectors of the arts and sciences experienced, in the course of the\r\nrevolution, was likely to produce quite a contrary effect. But the\r\nman of science and the artist, each abandoned to himself, acquired,\r\nin that forlorn situation, a knowledge and a taste which very\r\nfrequently are the result of long study only, seconded by\r\nencouragement from the wealthy.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of the fine ladies, of the rich, of the bankers, and\r\nmerchants in Paris, and generally speaking, of all those who, from\r\ntheir business and connexions, have most intercourse with the public\r\nand with foreigners, are furnished in the modern mode, that is, in\r\nthe antique taste. Many of the French artists, being destitute of\r\nemployment, were compelled through necessity to seek it; some entered\r\ninto the warehouse of the upholsterer to direct the shape and\r\ndisposition of his hangings; some, into the manufactory of the\r\npaper-maker to furnish him with new patterns; and others, into the\r\nshop of the cabinet-maker to sell him sketches of antique forms. Had\r\nthe easels of these artists been occupied by pictures no sooner\r\nfinished than paid for, the Grecian bed would not have expelled the\r\n_lit à la Polonaise_, in vogue here before the revolution; the\r\nEtruscan designs would not have succeeded to the Chinese paper; nor\r\nwould the curtains with Persian borders have been replaced by that\r\nelegant drapery which retraces the pure and simple taste of the\r\npeople of Attica.\r\n\r\nThe elegant forms of the modern French _secrétaires_, commodes,\r\nchairs, &c. have also been copied from the Greeks and Romans. The\r\nornaments of these are either bronzed or gilt, and are uncommonly\r\nwell finished. In general, they represent heads of men, women, and\r\nanimals, designed after the antique. Caryatides are sometimes\r\nintroduced, as well as Egyptian attributes; the arms of the chairs\r\nbeing frequently decorated with sphinxes. In short, on entering the\r\nresidence of a _parvenu_, you would fancy yourself suddenly\r\ntransported into the house of a wealthy Athenian; and these new\r\nfavourites of Fortune can, without crossing the threshold of their\r\nown door, study chaste antiquity, and imbibe a taste for other\r\nknowledge, connected with it, in which they are but little versed.\r\n\r\nMahogany is the wood employed for making these modern articles of\r\nfurniture, whose forms are no less varied than elegant; advantages\r\nwhich cause them to be preferred to the ancient. But the latter,\r\nthough heavy in their construction, are, nevertheless, thought, by\r\nsome persons, superior to the former in point of solidity and\r\nconvenience. The old-fashioned bedsteads and chairs are generally of\r\noak, painted or gilt, and are covered with silk or tapestry of\r\ndifferent patterns. The _ci-devant_ nobles appear to be greatly\r\nattached to them, and preserve them as monuments, which supply the\r\nplace of the titles and parchments they were forced to burn during\r\nthe sanguinary periods of the revolution. But this taste is not\r\nexclusive; several of the Parisian _bourgeois_, either from economy,\r\nor from a wish to appear to have belonged to that class, shew no less\r\neagerness to possess these spoils of the _noblesse_, as furniture for\r\ntheir apartments.\r\n\r\nWhile I am speaking of furniture, it naturally occurs to me that I\r\nhave not yet taken you to visit\r\n\r\nLES GOBELINS.\r\n\r\nThis national manufactory, which is situated in the _Faubourg St.\r\nMarcel_, takes its name from two famous Flemish dyers, who settled in\r\nParis under Francis I. In 1662, COLBERT purchased part of the old\r\npremises where the _Gobelins_ had carried on their business, and\r\nthere opened an establishment under the direction of LE BRUN. It was\r\nnot confined to the manufacture of tapestry only, but was composed of\r\npainters, sculptors, engravers, goldsmiths, watch-makers, lapidaries,\r\nand other artists and workmen of almost every description, whose\r\npupils and apprentices here acquired their freedom.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution, tapestry alone is manufactured here, on two\r\nsorts of looms, distinguished by the denominations of _haute_ and\r\n_basso lisse_, which are fully explained in an interesting _Notice_,\r\npublished by the intelligent director, GUILLAUMOT, who, it seems, has\r\nintroduced into each of these branches several recent improvements.\r\n\r\nThe art of making tapestry originated in England and Flanders, where\r\nthe cartoons of RAPHAEL and JULIO ROMANO were coarsely copied. It was\r\ngradually improved in France, and is now brought here to the greatest\r\nperfection. Indeed, a piece of _Gobelin_ tapestry may be called a\r\npicture painted with wool and silk; but its admirable execution\r\nproduces an illusion so complete, that skilful painters have been\r\nseen to lay their hands on this tapestry, to convince themselves that\r\nit was not a real painting.\r\n\r\nTapestry is now entirely out of fashion; and, with the exception of a\r\nfew small fancy-pieces, the productions of this manufactory are\r\nintended solely for the decoration of the national palaces and other\r\npublic buildings. In 1790 the blood-thirsty MARAT strove hard to\r\nannihilate this establishment, by exaggerating the expenses of its\r\nmaintenance. In 1789, their real amount was 144,000 francs; 116\r\njourneymen and 18 apprentices were then employed, and paid in\r\nproportion to their merit and to the quantity of work they performed.\r\nIn 1791, they were divided into classes, and paid by the day. This\r\nregulation produces less work, but its execution is more perfect,\r\nsince no motive of interest induces the workman to neglect his\r\nperformance. At present, its expenses cannot be so great, as the\r\nnumber of persons employed is less than 100. Should the penury of the\r\nfinances not allow the means of re-establishing pupils, this\r\nmanufactory will be extinguished like a lamp for want of oil. Twenty\r\nyears are necessary to make a good manufacturer of tapestry; those of\r\nthe first abilities are now nearly 70 years of age, and therefore it\r\nseems high time to prepare for them competent successors.\r\n\r\nAt _Chaillot_, we shall find another national manufactory, somewhat\r\nanalogous to the former, and which also claims the attention of the\r\ncurious observer. From having been fixed in a place originally\r\noccupied by a soap-house, it is called\r\n\r\nLA SAVONNERIE.\r\n\r\nIt was established, as far back as 1615, at the instigation of PIERRE\r\nDUPONT, who, being forced to quit his native land by the civil\r\ncommotions arising from the League, went to the Levant. Having seen\r\ncarpets made without taste or design in that country, he conceived\r\nthe idea of introducing a manufactory of this kind into France, where\r\nit would be susceptible of considerable improvement from the exercise\r\nof the arts unknown in Turkey. The project was approved by Henry IV,\r\nwho first gave DUPONT an establishment in the _Louvre_, which was\r\nafterwards transferred to its present situation.\r\n\r\nLike the _Gobelins_, the national manufactory of the _Savonnerie_ is,\r\nand has been, constantly supported by the government, and like it\r\ntoo, contributes to the decoration of the national palaces, &c.\r\nNothing, in the shape of carpets, can answer this purpose better than\r\nthose manufactured here, the colours of which are extremely\r\nbrilliant. The close, velvety texture of the manufacture gives a\r\npeculiar expression to objects which are copied from nature, such as\r\nthe hair of animals, the down of fruit, and the lustre of flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom its foundation till the year 1789, this manufactory continued to\r\nbe under the direction of a contractor, who delivered the carpeting\r\nto the government at the rate of 220 francs per square ell. At the\r\nrevolution, new regulations were established; the workmen were paid\r\nby the day, and classed according to their merit. In consequence,\r\nthough less work is performed, it is executed with greater\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe present government has lately ordered the old patterns, which\r\nwere overloaded with ornaments and flowers, to be suppressed, and\r\nreplaced by compositions more simple, more elegant, and infinitely\r\nmore tasteful. I understand that the workmen are to be put to\r\ntask-work, under the superintendance of the respectable administrator\r\nDUVIVIER, who informs me that the present price of this carpeting\r\namounts to 300 francs per square _mètre_ (_circa_ 3 ft. 3 inc.\r\nEnglish measure). In 1789, thirty persons were employed here, at from\r\n30 to 50 _sous_ a day. At present, there are no more than twenty, who\r\ndaily earn, on an average, 3 francs, and are lodged in the buildings\r\nof the manufactory.\r\n\r\nBefore I lay down my pen, I shall notice a national establishment,\r\nequally connected with the subject of this letter; I mean the\r\n\r\nMANUFACTORY OF PLATE-GLASS.\r\n\r\nLike all the other French manufactories, this has suffered from the\r\nrevolution and the war; but it has now nearly resumed its former\r\nactivity, owing to the effects of the peace and the laudable\r\nexertions of the government to revive commerce. At this time, it\r\ngives employment to about 600 persons.\r\n\r\nBefore COLBERT founded the present establishment, which is situated\r\nin the _Rue de Reuilli_, _Faubourg St. Antoine_, the French drew\r\ntheir plate-glass from Venice; but they have left their masters in\r\nthis branch very far behind them, and now make mirrors of dimensions\r\nof which the Venetians had no idea. These plates are cast at St.\r\nGobin, near La Fère, in the department of L'Aisne, and sent to Paris\r\nto be polished and silvered. Here you may witness the process\r\nemployed in each of these different operations.\r\n\r\nA method of joining together two small plates of glass in such a\r\nmanner that no mark appears, has, I am informed, been lately\r\ndiscovered in Paris. It is said, however, not to be applicable to\r\nthose of large dimensions. After the operation of this species of\r\nsoldering, the plates are silvered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 19, 1802._\r\n\r\nAs the period of my stay here is drawing rapidly towards a\r\nconclusion, I find much less leisure for writing; otherwise I should,\r\nin my last letter, have made you acquainted with an establishment not\r\nirrelevant to the leading subject of it, and which, when completed,\r\ncannot fail to attract general notice and admiration.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the PIRANESI. In the year 1800, PIETRO and\r\nFRANCESCO, the surviving sons of the celebrated GIOVANNI-BATTISTA,\r\ntransported to France their immense collection of drawings, with all\r\ntheir plates and engravings. They were welcomed, protected, and\r\nencouraged by the French government. Anxious to give to these\r\ningenious artists every facility for the success of an undertaking\r\nthat they had conceived, it has granted to them the spacious and\r\nhandsome premises of the _ci-devant Collège de Navarre_, in the _Rue\r\nde la Montagne St. Geneviève_, which the PIRANESI will shortly open\r\nas an\r\n\r\nACADEMY OF FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\nThat ancient college is extremely well calculated for such a\r\ndestination, from the extent of its buildings, its remoteness from\r\nnoise, and the airiness of its situation. By this liberal conduct to\r\nthe PIRANESI, the French government has shewn the warm interest it\r\ntakes in the progress of those arts. The establishment of these\r\nRomans is to be divided into three branches. The first is placed in\r\nthe _Collège de Navarre_; the second is to be in the _Palais du\r\nTribunat_; and the third, at _Morfontaine_.\r\n\r\nThree hundred artists of different nations, some of whom are known by\r\nmaster-pieces, while others announce the genius necessary for\r\nproducing them, are to be distributed in the seven classes of this\r\nacademy, which include the fine arts of every description. Each\r\nartist being at liberty to follow the branch to which he is most\r\npartial, it may easily be conceived how noble an emulation will be\r\nroused by such an assemblage of talents. Several are now employed\r\nhere in the workshops of Painting, Sculpture, Mosaic, and Engraving.\r\nLet us see in what manner.\r\n\r\nThe ground-floor is devoted to Sculpture. Here are made, in plaster\r\nand terra cotta, models of the finest monuments of Greece and Italy,\r\nwhich are executed in stone of the richest species, such as porphyry,\r\ngranite, red antique, Parian and Carrara marble. From the hands of\r\nthe two CARDELLI, and other eminent artists, are seen to issue copies\r\nof the most magnificent bas-reliefs of ancient Rome, and the most\r\nbeautiful friezes of RAPHAEL, MICHAEL ANGELO, JULIO ROMANO, and other\r\ngreat masters of the Italian school; tripods, obelisks, antique\r\nvases, articles of furniture in the Egyptian and Chinese taste,\r\ntogether with objects taken from nature, such as the most curious\r\nanimals in the national _ménagerie_, likewise occupy their talents.\r\nAll these subjects are executed in different sizes, and form,\r\ntogether or separately, decorations for apartments or tables,\r\nparticularly pilasters, and plateaux, in which the richness of the\r\nmaterials is surpassed by that of the workmanship.\r\n\r\nOn the same floor is the workshop of Mosaic. It is under the\r\ndirection of BELLONI, who has invented methods, by means of which he\r\nhas introduced Mosaic into articles of furniture, and for the\r\npavement of rich apartments, at prices far inferior to what might be\r\nimagined. The principal articles here exhibited, as specimens, are:\r\n--1. Superb marble tables and stands, in which are inserted ornaments\r\nand pictures in Mosaic, or incrustated in the Florentine manner--2. A\r\nlarge pavement, where the beauty and variety of the marbles are\r\nrelieved by embellished incrustations--3. Small pictures, in which\r\nthe painting, in very fine Mosaic, is raised on an even ground of one\r\npiece of black marble--4. Large tables, composed of specimens of\r\nfine-grained stones, such as jasper, agate, carnelion, lapis lazuli,\r\n&c. and also of valuable marbles, distributed into compartments and\r\nafter a design imitated from the antique, and enriched with a few\r\nincrustated pictures, representing animals and flowers. Besides\r\nthese, here are to be seen other essays of a kind entirely new. These\r\nare marbles, intended for furniture, coloured in an indelible manner.\r\nSometimes the figures and ornaments in them are coloured in the\r\nground; sometimes they are in colour, but raised on a ground of white\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nOn the first story is the workshop for Engraving. Here the artists\r\nare employed in engraving the seven hills of Rome, ancient circuses\r\nof that celebrated city, plans of the _forum_, obelisks of Rome and\r\nEgypt, ruins of Pompeia, drawn on the spot by the late J. B.\r\nPIRANESI, together with modern subjects, such as the splendid\r\nedifices of Paris, the beautiful views of the environs, the national\r\nfêtes, and every thing that can deservedly interest artists and\r\npersons of taste. On the same story are the plates of the PIRANESI\r\ncalcography, the place where they are printed, and the warehouse\r\nwhere they are deposited. The engravings, now nearly executed, will\r\nform upwards of twenty volumes; and those begun will equal that\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe second story is occupied by painters in oil-colours; the third,\r\nby those in water-colours; the fourth, by draughtsmen in Indian ink\r\nand bistre; and the fifth serves for the lodging of the artists,\r\nparticularly the most skilful among them, who direct the different\r\nbranches of this establishment. The principal pile of building is\r\ncrowned by a _Belvedere_, which commands an extensive view of Paris,\r\nand seems calculated for promoting the inspirations of genius. Here\r\nare copied, in oil, water-colours, Indian ink and bistre, the fresco\r\npaintings of RAPHAEL, MICHAEL ANGELO, and JULIO ROMANO; the Vatican,\r\nthe Farnesian palace, the Villa Altoviti, and the Villa Lante\r\nalternately furnishing models no less happily chosen than carefully\r\nexecuted. The antiquities of Herculaneum, so interesting from the\r\nknowledge they afford us of the customs of the ancient Romans, and\r\nfrom the elegant decorations of which they have procured us the\r\nmodels, the ruins of Palmyra and Balbeck, those of Greece and Sicily,\r\ntogether with views of Constantinople and of the country in which it\r\nis situated, are here rendered with the most exact truth, joined to\r\nthe most harmonious colouring. Here too are represented; in the three\r\nmanners before-mentioned, views and sites of Egypt, Greece, Italy,\r\nFrance, and all other countries; cascades, such as those of TERNI,\r\nNARNI, and TIVOLI; sea-pieces; landscapes, parks; and gardens;\r\narabesques after RAPHAEL; new and picturesque plants; in a word,\r\ndecorations formed of an assemblage of every thing most perfect in\r\nart and nature.\r\n\r\nOn the first and second stories are also two exhibition-rooms, for\r\nsuch pictures and works of sculpture as are finished, where the eye\r\nwanders agreeably amidst a crowd of objects of an enlivening or\r\nserious nature. Here it is that the amateur, after having seen the\r\nartists at work in the classes of this academy, fixes his choice on\r\nthe kind of production which most takes his fancy. These two rooms\r\ncontain the different articles which are afterwards to be displayed\r\nin the two porticos of the _Palais du Tribunat_.\r\n\r\nThose elegant and spacious porticos, situated in the most centrical\r\npart of Paris, facing the _Rue St. Honoré_, have likewise been\r\ngranted to the PRIANESI through the special favour of the government.\r\nNot only all the productions of their establishment, but also the\r\nprincipal master-pieces in painting, sculpture, and architecture,\r\nproduced by artists of all nations, will there be exhibited; so that\r\nthose porticos will present, as it were, an Encyclopædia of the Fine\r\nArts.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The principal protector of the undertaking of the\r\nPIRANESI is JOSEPH BONAPARTE, who has not confined himself to\r\nassisting them in the capital. Being desirous to introduce the arts\r\ninto the country where he passes the finest season of the year, and\r\nto promote the discovery of the PIRANESI, relative to the properties\r\nof the argill found at _Morfontaine_, he has given to them for\r\nseveral years the use of a large building and a very extensive piece\r\nof ground, ornamented with bowers, where all the subjects modelled at\r\nthe _Collège de Navarre_, in _terra cotta_ or in porcelain of\r\n_Morfontaine_, undergo the process of baking. In the last-mentioned\r\nplace, the PIRANESI purpose to establish a foundery for sculpture in\r\nbronze and other metals. The government daily affords to them\r\nencouragement and resources which insure the success of their\r\nestablishment. To its other advantages are added a library, and a\r\nprinting-office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 22, 1802._\r\n\r\nAs to the mechanical arts, if you are desirous to view some of the\r\nmodern improvements and inventions in that line, you must accompany\r\nme to the _Rue St. Martin_, where, in the _ci-devant_ priory, is an\r\nestablishment of recent date, entitled the\r\n\r\nCONSERVATORY OF ARTS AND TRADES.\r\n\r\nHere is a numerous collection of machines of every description\r\nemployed in the mechanical arts. Among these is the _belier\r\nhydraulique_, newly invented by MONTGOLFIER, by means of which a\r\nstream of water, having a few feet of declivity, can be raised to the\r\ntop of a house by a single valve or sucker, so disposed as to open,\r\nto admit the water, and shut, when it is to be raised by compression.\r\nBy increasing the compression, it can be raised to 1000 feet, and may\r\nbe carried to a much greater elevation. The commissioners appointed\r\nby the Institute to examine this machine, reported that it was new,\r\nvery simple, very ingenious, and might be extremely useful in turning\r\nto account little streams of water for the purposes of agriculture,\r\nmanufactories, &c.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of another singular hydraulic machine, of which I\r\nhave been informed by a person who attended a trial made of it not\r\nlong since in Paris.\r\n\r\nA basin placed at the height of twenty feet, was filled with water,\r\nthe fall of which set in motion several wheels and pumps that raised\r\nthe water again into the basin. The machine was fixed in a place,\r\nglazed on all sides, and locked by three different keys. It kept in\r\nplay for thirty-two days, without the smallest interruption; but the\r\nair, the heat, and the wood of the machine, having undoubtedly\r\ndiminished the water, it no longer ascended into the basin. Till the\r\nthirty-second day, many persons imagined that the perpetual motion\r\nhad been discovered. However, this machine was extremely light, well\r\ncombined, and very simple in its construction. I ought to observe\r\nthat it neither acted by springs nor counterpoise; all its powers\r\nproceeding from the fall of the water.\r\n\r\nThe conservatory also contains several models of curious buildings,\r\ntoo numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical arts in France appear to have experienced more or less\r\nthe impulse given to the sciences towards the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. While calamities oppressed this country, and commerce was\r\nsuspended, the inventive and fertile genius of the French was not\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nThe clothiers have introduced woollen articles manufactured on a new\r\nplan; and their fine broad cloths and kerseymeres have attained great\r\nperfection. The introduction of the Spanish merinos into France has\r\nalready produced in her wools a considerable amelioration.\r\n\r\nLike a phoenix, Lyons is reviving from its ashes, and its silks now\r\nsurpass, if possible, their former magnificence. Brocaded silk is at\r\npresent made in a loom worked by one man only, in lieu of two, which\r\nthe manufacture of that article hitherto demanded. Another new\r\ninvention is a knitting-loom, by means of which 400 threads are\r\ninterwoven with the greatest exactness, by merely turning a winch.\r\n\r\nThe cotton manufactures are much improved, and the manufactories in\r\nthat line are daily increasing in number and perfection. A new\r\nspinning-machine has produced here, I am told, 160,000 ells in length\r\nout of a pound of cotton. The fly-shuttle is now introduced into most\r\nof the manufactories in this country, and 25 pieces of narrow goods\r\nare thus made at once by a single workman. In adopting ARKWRIGHT'S\r\nsystem, the French have applied it to small machines, which occupy no\r\nmore room than a common spinning-wheel.\r\n\r\nAmong other branches in which the French mechanics have particularly\r\ndistinguished themselves, since the revolution, is the making of\r\nastronomical and philosophical instruments.\r\n\r\nAll the machines used here in coining have also been modified and\r\nimproved. By one of these, the piece is struck at the same time on\r\nthe edge and on the flat side in so perfect a manner, that the money\r\nthus coined cannot he counterfeited.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the invention of a composition which\r\nsupplies the place of black lead for pencils, and the discovery of a\r\nnew and very expeditious method of tanning leather.\r\n\r\nNew species of earthen-ware have been invented, and those already\r\nknown have received considerable improvement.\r\n\r\nChemists have put the manufacturers in possession of new means of\r\ndecomposing and recomposing substances. Muriat of tin is now made\r\nhere with such economy, that it is reduced to one-eighth of its\r\nformer price. This salt is daily used in dying and in the manufacture\r\nof printed calicoes. Carbonates of strontia and of baryt, obtained by\r\na new process, will shortly be sold in Paris at 3 francs the\r\n_kilogramme_. This discovery is expected to have a great influence on\r\nseveral important arts, such as the manufacture of glass, of soap,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nArticles of furniture, jewellery, and every branch dependent on\r\ndesign, are now remarkable for a purer taste than that which they\r\nformerly exhibited.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the characteristic difference of the present state of French\r\nindustry, and that in which it was before the revolution, is that\r\nmost of the proprietors of the manufactories have received a\r\nscientific education. At that time, many of them were strangers to\r\nthe principles applicable to the processes of their art; and, in this\r\nrespect, they lay at the mercy of the routine, ignorance, and caprice\r\nof their workmen. At present, the happy effects of instruction, more\r\nwidely-diffused, begin to be felt, and, in proportion as it is\r\nextended, it excites a spirit of emulation which promises no small\r\nadvantage to French commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 23, 1802._\r\n\r\nIn the richness of her territory, the abundance of her population,\r\nthe activity of her inhabitants, and the knowledge comprised in her\r\nbosom, France possesses great natural advantages; but the effect\r\nwhich they might have produced on her industry, has been counteracted\r\nby the errors of her old government, and the calamities attendant on\r\nthe revolution. Some public-spirited men, thinking the moment\r\nfavourable for restoring to them all their influence, have lately\r\nmet; and from this union has sprung the\r\n\r\nSOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF NATIONAL INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nIt is formed on a scale still more extensive than the _Society for\r\nthe encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce_, instituted at\r\nLondon. Its meetings are held in the _Louvre_; but, though fixed in\r\nthe metropolis, it embraces the whole extent of the Republic, and\r\nevery department will participate in the benefits which it proffers.\r\n\r\nThe chief objects of this society are: To collect, from all quarters,\r\ndiscoveries and inventions useful to the progress of the arts; to\r\nbestow annually premiums and gratuitous encouragements; to propagate\r\ninstruction, by disseminating manuals on different objects relative\r\nto the arts, by combining the lights of theory with the results of\r\npractice, and by constructing at its own expense, and disseminating\r\namong the public in general, and particularly in the manufactories,\r\nsuch machines, instruments, and apparatus as deserve to be more\r\ngenerally known and brought into use; to make essays and experiments\r\nfor ascertaining the utility which may be expected from new\r\ndiscoveries; to make advances to artists who may be in distress, or\r\ndeficient in the means to put in practice the processes of their\r\ninventions; to unite by new ties all such persons as from their\r\nsituation in life, their taste, or their talents, feel an interest in\r\nthe progress of the arts; to become the centre of similar\r\ninstitutions, which are called for in all the principal\r\nmanufacturing-towns of the Republic; in a word, to _excite emulation,\r\ndiffuse knowledge, and assist talents_.\r\n\r\nTo attain these objects, various committees, consisting of men the\r\nmost conversant in knowledge relative to the arts, are already\r\nappointed, and divide among them _gratuitously_ the whole of the\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThis society, founded, on principles so purely patriotic, will, no\r\ndoubt, essentially second the strenuous efforts of the government to\r\nreanimate the different branches of national industry. The free and\r\nspontaneous concurrence of the men of whom it is composed, may unite\r\nthe power of opinion to that of other means; and public opinion\r\nproduces naturally that which power and authority obtain only by a\r\nslow and difficult progress.\r\n\r\nBut, while those branches of industry, more immediately connected\r\nwith the arts, are stimulated by these simultaneous encouragements,\r\nthat science, on the practice of which depends the welfare of States,\r\nis not neglected. Independently of the Council of Agriculture,\r\nCommerce and Arts, established under the presidency of the Minister\r\nof the Interior, here is a\r\n\r\nFREE SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nIts object is to improve agriculture, not only in the department of\r\nLa Seine, but throughout France. For this purpose, it maintains a\r\nregular correspondence with all the agricultural societies of the\r\nother departments. It publishes memoirs, in which are inserted the\r\nresults of its labours, as well as the notices and observations read\r\nat the meetings by any one of its members, and the decision which has\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nEvery year it proposes prizes for the solution of some question\r\nimportant to the amelioration of agriculture.\r\n\r\nWhat, at first view, appears extraordinary, is not, on that account,\r\nless founded on truth. Amidst the storms of the revolution,\r\nagriculture has been improved in France. At a period of happiness and\r\ntranquillity, the soil was not so well cultivated as in times of\r\nterror and mourning; because, during the latter, the lands enjoyed\r\nthe franchises so long wanted. Hands never failed; for, when the men\r\nmarched to the armies, women supplied their place; and no one was\r\nashamed to handle the spade or the plough.\r\n\r\nHowever, if, in 1789, agriculture in France was far from a state of\r\nprosperity, it was beginning to receive new light from the labours of\r\nthe agricultural societies. That of Paris had given a great impulse\r\nto the culture of artificial meadows, potatoes, hemp, flax, and\r\nfruit-trees. Practical directions, spread with profusion in the\r\ncountry, had diverted the inhabitants from the routine which they had\r\nblindly followed from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the French began to imitate us in gelding\r\ntheir horses, and giving to their lackies, their coachmen, and their\r\nequipages an English appearance; instead of copying us in the\r\ncultivation of our land, and adopting the principles of our rural\r\neconomy. This want of foresight they are now anxious to repair, by\r\nincreasing their pastures, and enriching them by an extensive variety\r\nof plants, augmenting the number of their cattle, whether intended\r\nfor subsistence or reproduction, and improving the breed by a mixture\r\nof races well assorted, procuring a greater quantity of manure,\r\nvarying their culture so as not to impoverish the soil, and\r\nseparating their lands by inclosures, which obviate the necessity of\r\nconstantly employing herdsmen to tend their cattle.\r\n\r\nAgriculture has, unquestionably, suffered much, and is still\r\nsuffering in the western departments. Notwithstanding the succour\r\nafforded by the government to rebuild and repair the deserted\r\ncottages and barns, to supply them with men and cattle, to set the\r\nploughs to work, and revive industry, it is still evident that the\r\nwant of confidence which maintains the value of money at an\r\nexorbitant rate, the love of stock-jobbing, the impossibility of\r\nopening small loans, the excessive price of manual labour,\r\ncontributions exacted in advance, and the distress of most of the\r\nland-owners, who are not in a condition to shew favour to their\r\ntenants, are scourges which still overwhelm the country. But I am\r\ncredibly informed that, in general, the rural inhabitants now lend a\r\nmore attentive ear to instruction, and that prejudices have less\r\nempire over their reason. The great landed proprietors, whom terror\r\nhad induced to fly their country, have, on recovering possession of\r\ntheir patrimony, converted their parks into arable land. Others, who\r\nare not fond of living in town, are daily repairing to their estates,\r\nin order to superintend the cultivation of them. No one disdains the\r\nsimple title of farmer. Old publications relative to agriculture are\r\nreprinted in a form more within reach of the capacity of the people;\r\nthough treatises on domestic animals are still much wanted.\r\n\r\nAt Rambouillet, formerly the country-seat of the duke of Penthièvre,\r\nis an experimental national farm. Fine cattle are now held in high\r\nestimation. Flocks of sheep of the Spanish breed are daily\r\nincreasing; and the number of those of a pure race, already imported,\r\nor since bred in France, exceeds 8000.[1] Wide roads, which led to\r\none solitary castle only, have been ploughed, and sown. The rage for\r\nornamental gardens and pleasure-grounds is dying away. The breeding\r\nof horses, a branch of industry which the war and the requisition had\r\ncaused to be abandoned, is on the point of being resumed with\r\nincreased activity. It is in contemplation to establish studs, on\r\nplans better combined and much more favourable to the object than\r\nthose which formerly existed. In short, the ardent wish of the\r\nthinking part of the nation seems to be, that the order which the\r\ngovernment is endeavouring to introduce into every branch of its\r\nadministration, may determine the labourer to proportion his hire to\r\nthe current price of corn; but all these truths assembled form not\r\nsuch a sketch as you may, perhaps, expect. The state of French\r\nagriculture has never yet been delineated on a comprehensive scale,\r\nexcept by Arthur Young. You must persuade him to repeat his tour, if\r\nyou wish for a perfect picture.[2]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_March 22, in continuation._\r\n\r\nMost persons are acquainted with DIDOT'S stereotypic editions of the\r\nclassics, &c. which are sold here for 15 _sous_ per copy. Nothing\r\nmore simple than the plan of this mode of printing. A page is first\r\nset up in moveable types; a mould or impression is then taken of the\r\npage with any suitable plastic substance, and a solid page is cast\r\nfrom it. The expense of a solid page exceeds not that of resetting it\r\nin moveable types; so that, by this invention, the price of books\r\nwill be considerably reduced, and standard works will never be out of\r\nprint. Nor are these the only advantages attending the use of\r\nstereotype; I must mention another of still greater importance.\r\n\r\nBy the common method of printing, it is impossible ever to have\r\ncorrect books. They are in the market before all their errors are\r\ndiscovered; and the latest edition of a work, which ought to be the\r\nmost correct, is necessarily the most faulty; for it presents not\r\nonly the errors of that from which it was copied, but also those\r\npeculiar to itself. Stereotypic books are printed only to answer the\r\nextent of the demand; and errors, when discovered, being corrected in\r\nthe metal, they must, through time and attention, become immaculate;\r\na circumstance of infinite importance in astronomical and\r\nmathematical tables of every description.[3]\r\n\r\nFor elegance of printing, DIDOT is the BENSLEY of Paris; but to see a\r\ngrand establishment in this line, you must go to the _Rue de la\r\nVrillière_, near the _Place des Victoires_, and visit the\r\n\r\nPRINTING-OFFICE OF THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nUnder the title of _Imprimerie Royale_, this establishment vas\r\nformerly placed in the galleries of the _Louvre_. Instituted by\r\nFrancis I in 1531, it was greatly enlarged and improved under Lewis\r\nXIII and Lewis XIV. It has also been considerably augmented since its\r\nremoval, in 1791, to the hotel belonging to the late Duke of\r\nPenthièvre, which it now occupies.\r\n\r\nIn its present state, it may be considered as the most extensive and\r\nmost complete typographical establishment in being. Every branch\r\nrelating to typography, from the casting of the type to the article\r\nof binding, is here united. The _dépôt_ of punches contains upwards\r\nof 30,000 characters of all languages. Among others, here are to be\r\nremarked, in all their primitive purity, the beautiful Greek ones of\r\nGaramon, engraved by order of Francis I, and which served for the\r\neditions of the Stephen, the Byzantine, &c, the oriental characters\r\nof the Polyglot of Vitræus, and the collection of exotic characters\r\nfrom the printing-office of the Propaganda. The government business\r\nalone constantly employs one hundred presses. A much greater number\r\ncan be set to work, if wanted.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the works concerning administration and the\r\nsciences, which are executed here at the public cost, the government\r\nallows authors to cause to be printed at this office, at their own\r\nprivate expense, such works as, on account of their importance, the\r\ndifficulty of execution, and the particular types which they require,\r\nare entitled to that favour.\r\n\r\nOn applying to the director, the amateurs of typography are instantly\r\nadmitted to view this establishment, and shewn every thing\r\ninteresting in it, with that spirit of liberality which is extended\r\nto every public institution here, and which reflects the highest\r\nhonour on the French nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At the last annual sale at Rambouillet, the average\r\nprice of a good Spanish ram was no more than 412 francs or £17\r\nsterling. The dearest sold for 620 francs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The statistical accounts of the different departments,\r\nwhich are to be compiled by order of the Minister of the Interior,\r\nwill specify all the agricultural improvements. The few already\r\npublished, shew that if the population of France is somewhat\r\ndiminished in the large towns, it is considerably increased in the\r\ncountry-places.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It is, however, to be remarked that the merit of this\r\ninvaluable invention is not due to France, but to Britain. As far\r\nback as the year 1725, a Mr. GED, of Edinburgh, turned his thoughts\r\nto the formation of cast letter-press plates, and, in 1736, printed a\r\nstereotype edition of Sallust. Being opposed by a combination of\r\nprinters and booksellers, whose ignorance and prejudices he was\r\nunable to overcome, he relinquished the prosecution of his discovery;\r\nand thus the stereotypic art was lost to the world, till\r\nrediscovered, in 1780, by Mr. ALEXANDER TILLOCH. In the year 1783,\r\nMr. TILLOCH took out a patent for it, in conjunction with Mr. FOULIS,\r\nthen printer to the University of Glasgow. They printed several books\r\nin this manner; but it seems that they also experienced an opposition\r\nfrom the booksellers, and, owing to different circumstances, have not\r\nsince availed themselves of their patent. Notwithstanding this\r\nevidence of priority, the French dispute the invention; and the\r\nlearned CAMUS, in his \"_Historical Sketch of Polytypage and\r\nStereotypage_,\" affirms, on the authority of LOTTIN, that, towards\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century, the stereotypic process was put\r\nin practice in France, for printing the calendars prefixed to the\r\nmissals. Hence it is seen that the claim of the English is supported\r\nby positive proof; while that of the French rests on bare assertion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March_ 26, 1802.\r\n\r\nIn visiting a foreign country, and more especially its capital, the\r\ntraveller, whose object is instruction, enters into the most minute\r\ndetails, in order to obtain a complete knowledge of the various\r\nclasses of its inhabitants. As Seneca justly observes, in his\r\nepistles, what benefit can a person reap from his travels, who spends\r\nall his time in examining the beauty and magnificence of public\r\nbuildings? Will the contemplation of them render him more wise, more\r\ntemperate, more liberal in his ideas? Will it remove his prejudices\r\nand errors? It may amuse him for a time, as a child, by the novelty\r\nand variety of objects, which excite an unmeaning admiration. To act\r\nthus, adds the learned stoic, is not to travel, it is to wander, and\r\nlose both one's time and labour.\r\n\r\n  \"_Non est hoc peregrinari, sed erraie_.\"\r\n\r\nWherefore Horace, in imitation of Homer, says, in praise of Ulysses,\r\n\r\n  \"_Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, et urbes_.\"\r\n\r\nI have, I hope, given you enough of sights and shows; let us then, my\r\ngood friend, follow the wise example of the ancients, and take a view\r\nof men and manners.\r\n\r\nOwing, in some measure, to the levity of French character, and the\r\nfreedom which now prevails generally enough in all society here, this\r\nsort of study, sometimes so tedious, is greatly facilitated. In the\r\nParisian assemblies of the present day, by an almost continual\r\ncollision, self-love discovers the weak side of an individual whose\r\nwhole merit consists in a little small-talk, and a rotation of those\r\n_jolis petits riens_, which, seconded by a well-favoured countenance\r\nand an agreeable carriage, have given him in the world the reputation\r\nof an amiable man; while, from another, we see a thousand essential\r\nqualities, concealed under a coarse exterior, force themselves into\r\nnotice, and which his modesty, or more frequently his timidity,\r\nprevented him from displaying.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding preamble, you will naturally conclude that I\r\npurpose to appropriate this letter to a few remarks on the\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nIn this city are three very distinct kinds of society. But the order\r\nI shall adopt in the description of each of them must not, in any\r\nway, lead you to prejudge my opinion respecting the rank which they\r\nhold among the French themselves. In this respect, I shall abstain\r\nfrom every sort of reflection, and, confining myself to the simple\r\ncharacter of a faithful narrator, shall leave to your sagacity to\r\ndecide the question.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by the society, chiefly composed of the _ci-devant\r\nnoblesse_, several of whom, never having quitted France, have\r\npreserved some of their property; and of emigrants, lately returned\r\nto their own country, and who have enough remaining to allow them to\r\nhave a household establishment, but in a very modest style indeed,\r\ncompared to that which their rank and fortune enabled them to support\r\nbefore the revolution.\r\n\r\nYou present yourself at the residence of _Madame la Marquise de\r\nC----_. In the anti-room, you declare your name and quality to the\r\ngroom of the chambers. Then, the opening of one or two folding-doors\r\nannounces to the mistress of the house, and to the company, the\r\n_quantum_ of the ceremonies which are to be paid to the newcomer.\r\nKeep your eye constantly on the _Marquise_, her behaviour will\r\nregulate yours in regard to the individuals who compose her party. In\r\nthe course of conversation, take special care not to omit the title\r\nof the person to whom you address yourself. Such an instance of\r\nforgetfulness savours of a man of the new _régime_. Never pronounce\r\nthe new denominations respecting the divisions of the French\r\nterritory, the months, the weights, measures, &c. Those words would\r\ndraw on you an unfavourable interpretation. If you are inclined to\r\nhear a discussion on the arts and sciences, or on any new discovery\r\nwhatever, you seldom find, in these parties, persons who can gratify\r\nyour taste; though you may meet with many who, as Locke says, \"know a\r\nlittle, presume a great deal, and so jump to a conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the plebeians, whose presence the _ci-devant_ nobles are so\r\ncondescending as to endure, much obsequiousness and servility are\r\nrequired; and it is expected that the distance of rank should never\r\nbe forgotten. But the learned or scientific French revolutionist, who\r\nadmits no other distance than that between knowledge and ignorance,\r\nnot choosing to submit to such conditions, seldom presents himself at\r\nthe house of _Madame la Marquise de C----_. However, you will hear\r\nher company speak of the court of France, of the interest which each\r\nindividual had there, and also a few anecdotes not uninteresting, and\r\nwhich will furnish you with some ideas of the brilliant parties there\r\nformed. After this discussion, one will talk to you of his regiment;\r\nanother, of his hunting establishment, of his _châteaux_, of his\r\nestates, &c. _Chez Madame la Marquise de C----_, you will find no\r\ninconsiderable prepossession against every thing that is not of the\r\nold order of things, and even some exclusive pretensions to manners\r\nwhich belong to those only who are real gentlemen. Yet, through all\r\nthese absurdities, you will always see good-breeding prevail in this\r\nsociety, and the disposition which distinguishes a Frenchman from\r\nother polished nations, will here break forth and present itself to\r\nyou in a striking manner.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the _ci-devant noblesse_, I cannot forbear to\r\nmention the loss which those who had the happiness of her\r\nacquaintance, have sustained by the recent death of Madame DE\r\nCHOISEUL, the relict of the duke of that name, minister to Lewis XV.\r\nHer virtues shed such a lustre round her, that it reached even the\r\nmonarch himself, who, when he banished her husband to Chanteloup,\r\nwrote to him: \"I should have sent you much further, but for the\r\nparticular esteem I have for Madame DE CHOISEUL, in whose health I\r\ntake no small interest.\" This uncommonly-respectable woman will long\r\nbe quoted and deservedly regretted, because she was modest in\r\ngreatness, beneficent in prosperity, courageous in misfortune, pure\r\nin the vortex of corruption, solid in the midst of frivolity, as\r\nsimple in her language as she was brilliant in her understanding, and\r\nas indulgent to others as she was superior to them in grace and\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nI shall next lead you to the house of a _parvenu_, that is, one of\r\nthose, who, from having made some successful speculations, and\r\npossessing a conscience not overnice as to the means of fixing\r\nFortune, is enabled to live in the expensive style of the _ci-devant_\r\ncourt-lords and farmers-general. A letter changed in the person's\r\nname, not unfrequently a _de_ or a _St._ added, (sometimes both)\r\npuzzles the curious, who endeavour to discover what was formerly M.\r\n_de St. H------_, now in the enjoyment of an annual income of a\r\nhundred thousand francs, or £4000 sterling.\r\n\r\nAt his house, more than any where else, etiquette is kept up with an\r\nextraordinary minuteness; and evil tongues will tell you that it is\r\nnatural for M. _de St. H------_ to remember and avail himself of the\r\nobservations which he had it in his power to make in the place he\r\nformerly occupied. Under his roof, you will find little of that ease\r\nand amiableness which are to be remarked in the other societies of\r\nParis. Each individual is on his guard, and afraid of betraying\r\nhimself by certain expressions, which the force of habit has not yet\r\nallowed him to forget. But if you are fond of good music, if you take\r\na pleasure in balls, and in the company of _femmes galantes_ or\r\ndemireps; and even if first-rate jugglers, ventriloquists, and mimics\r\namuse you by their skilful performances, frequent the house of M. _de\r\nSt. H------_, and every day, or at least every day that he is at\r\nhome, you will have a new entertainment.\r\n\r\nBetween the acts, the company make their remarks, each in his own\r\nway, on what they have just seen or heard. Afterwards, the\r\nconversation turns on the public funds. Little is said, however, on\r\naffairs of State, the bankruptcies of the day, and the profit which\r\nsuch or such a speculation might produce. The ladies, after having\r\nexhausted the subject of the toilet, finish by giving, as an apology\r\nfor their own conduct, the charitable enumeration of the peccadilloes\r\nwhich they fancy they have remarked in other women.\r\n\r\nSo little am I disposed for gaming, that I forgot to mention\r\n_bouillotte_, _quinze_, and also whist and reversi, which are\r\nintroduced at all these parties. But the two last-mentioned games are\r\nreserved for those only who seek in cards nothing more than a\r\nrecreation from the occupations of the day. At the others, gain is\r\nthe sole object of the player; and many persons sit at the\r\ngaming-table the whole night, and, in the depth of winter even,\r\nnever leave it till the \"garish sun\" warns them that it is time\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\nI have now only to introduce you at M. _B------'s_, Counsellor of\r\nState. Here you will find the completion of the other two societies,\r\nand a very numerous party, which affords to every one a conversation\r\nanalogous to his taste or his means. Refrain, however, from touching\r\non politics; the French government, still in its infancy, resembles a\r\nyoung plant exposed to the inclemency of the air, and whose growth is\r\ndirected by skilful hands. This government must remove, and even\r\nsometimes destroy every obstacle it meets with, and which may be\r\nprejudicial to the form and direction that it thinks proper to give\r\nto its branches and various ramifications. Beware, above all, of\r\nspeaking of the revolution. That string is too delicate to be touched\r\nin regard to certain individuals of M. _B------'s_ party, perhaps\r\nalso in regard to himself: for the periods of the calamities which\r\nthe French have undergone are still quite recent, and the parts that\r\nmany of these persons may have acted, call to mind recollections too\r\npainful, which, for their tranquillity, ought ever to be buried in\r\noblivion. And, in fact, you will always perceive, in the meetings of\r\nthis class, a harmony, apparent indeed, but which, surprises a\r\nstranger the more, as, of all the societies in Paris, it presents to\r\nhim the greatest medley in point of the persons who compose it.\r\n\r\nIn this society you will hear very instructive dissertations on the\r\nsciences, sound literature, the fine arts, mechanics, and the means\r\nof rendering useful the new discoveries, by applying them with\r\neconomy to the French manufactories, either public or private: for M.\r\n_B------_ considers it as his duty to receive with distinction all\r\nthe _savans_, and generally all those called men of talent. In this\r\nline of conduct, he follows the example set him by the government;\r\nand every one is desirous to appear a Mæcenas in the eyes of\r\nAugustus. In other respects, the house of M. _B------_ will afford\r\nyou the agreeble pastimes which you have found at M. _de St.\r\nH------'s_.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, however, are several other societies which, to consider\r\nthem rightly, are no more than a diminutive of those you have just\r\nleft; but which, nevertheless, are of a character sufficiently\r\ndistinct in their composition to justify their pretensions to be\r\nclassed as well as the others. This difference proceeding chiefly\r\nfrom that of political opinions alone, an acquaintance with the great\r\nsocieties here will enable you to select those of the middle class\r\nwhich you may think proper to frequent, according to your taste, or\r\nyour manner of seeing and judging of the events of the French\r\nrevolution. Yet, you must not hence conclude that the conversation\r\nturns chiefly on that subject in this particular class of the\r\nParisian societies. They concern themselves less about it perhaps\r\nthan the others, whether from the little share they have had in it,\r\nor because they have but very indirect connexions with the\r\ngovernment, or lastly, and this final reason is, I believe, the most\r\nconclusive, because a Frenchman, from the nature of his character,\r\nends by forgetting his misfortunes and losses, cares little for the\r\nfuture, and appears desirous to enjoy the present only; following, in\r\nthat respect, the precept of La Fontaine:\r\n\r\n  _\"Jouis dès aujourd'hui, tu n'as pas tant à vivre;\r\n  Je te rebàts ce mot--car il vaut tout un livre.\"_\r\n\r\nIn truth, although, among this people, vexations and enjoyments are\r\nalmost always the result of imagination, they have preserved the\r\nremembrance of their misfortunes only to turn to account the terrible\r\nlessons which they have received from them, by adopting, in regard to\r\nthe present and to the future, that happy philosophy which knows how\r\nto yield to the circumstances of the moment. This it is (you may rely\r\non the fact) that has contributed, more than any other cause, to\r\nre-establish, in so short a period, the order and tranquillity which\r\nFrance presents to the eyes of astonished foreigners. This it is too\r\nthat has, in a great measure, obviated the fatal consequences which\r\ntheir past troubles must have made them fear for a long time to come,\r\nand for which few remedies could be expected, especially when we\r\nreflect on the divisions which the revolution has sown in almost\r\nevery family in this country.\r\n\r\nP. S. The sound of cannon, which strikes my ear at this moment,\r\nannounces the signature of the definitve treaty. In the evening, a\r\ngrand illumination will take place to celebrate the return of the\r\nmost desirable of all blessings.\r\n\r\n  \"------------O beauteous Peace!\r\n  Sweet union of a State! What else but thou\r\n  Giv'st safety, strength, and glory to a people?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 28, 1802._\r\n\r\nWhatever changes may have been introduced by the revolution, in one\r\nrespect at least, the Parisians still preserve towards foreigners\r\nthat urbanity for which they were remarkable half a century ago, when\r\nSterne paid them a visit. If you ask a shopkeeper here, of either\r\nsex, the way to a place, perhaps at some distance, he or she neglects\r\nthe occupation of the moment to direct you, with as much solicitude\r\nand attention as though a considerable advantage was to be the result\r\nof the given information. It is the small sweet courtesies of life,\r\nas that sentimental traveller remarks, which render the road of it\r\nless rugged.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, a foreigner pays dearly for the civility shewn him\r\nin Paris; but, in laying out his money, he must ever bear in mind\r\nthat the shopkeepers make no scruple to overcharge their articles to\r\ntheir own countrymen, and some will not blush to take, even from\r\nthem, a third less than the price demanded.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival here, I think I mentioned to you the excessive\r\ndearness of\r\n\r\nFURNISHED LODGINGS.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution, their price is nearly doubled, and is extremely\r\nhigh in the most fashionable parts of the town, such as the _Chaussée\r\nd'Antin_, the _Rue de la Loi_, the _Rue de la Concorde_, &c. For\r\nstrangers that know not in Paris any friend who will take the trouble\r\nto seek for them suitable apartments, the only way to procure good\r\naccommodation is to alight at a ready-furnished hotel, and there hire\r\nrooms by the day till they can look about them, and please\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I prefer the quiet of a private lodging to the\r\nbustle of a public hotel, and, as I have before mentioned, my\r\nconstant resource, on such occasions, has been the _Petites\r\nAffiches_. If you go to the office where this Daily Advertiser is\r\npublished, and inspect the file, it is ten to one that you\r\nimmediately find apartments to your wishes.\r\n\r\nA single man may now be comfortably lodged here, in a private house\r\nwith a _porte-cochère_, at from 5 to 8 louis per month; and a small\r\nfamily may be well accommodated, in that respect, at from 12 to 16\r\nlouis. A larger party, requiring more room, may obtain excellent\r\napartments at from 20 louis a month upwards, according to the\r\nsituation, the conveniences, the taste and condition of the\r\nfurniture, and other contingencies. To prevent subsequent\r\nmisunderstanding, I would always recommend a written agreement.\r\n\r\nThe English have hitherto paid dearer than other foreigners for\r\nwhatever they want in Paris, because they generally trust to their\r\nservants, and think it beneath them to look into those matters\r\nconnected with their own comfort. But the _Milords Anglais_ are now\r\nentirely eclipsed by the Russian Counts, who give two louis where the\r\nEnglish offer one. A person's expenses here, as every where else,\r\nmaterially depend on good management, without which a thoughtless man\r\nsquanders twice as much as a more considerate one; and while the\r\nformer obtains no more than the common comforts of life, the latter\r\nenjoys all its indulgences.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the gratifications of the table, I have little to add\r\nto what I have already said on that subject, in speaking of the\r\n_restaurateurs_. If you choose to become a boarder, you may subscribe\r\nat the _Hôtel du Cirque_, _Rue de la Loi_, and sit down every day in\r\ngood company for about seven louis a month; and there are very\r\nrespectable private houses, where you may, when once introduced, dine\r\nvery well for five livres a time; but, at all these places, you are\r\nsure to meet either English or Americans; and the consequence is,\r\nthat you are eternally speaking your mother-tongue, which is a\r\nmaterial objection with those who are anxious to improve themselves\r\nin the French language. For a man who brings his family to Paris, and\r\nresides in private apartments, it might, perhaps, be more advisable\r\nto hire a cook, and live _à l'Anglaise_ or _à la Française_,\r\naccording to his fancy.\r\n\r\nNo conveniences have been so much improved in Paris, since the\r\nrevolution, as\r\n\r\nJOB AND HACKNEY CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the _remises_ or job-carriages were far inferior to those\r\nin use at the present day; and the old _fiacres_ or hackney-coaches\r\nwere infamous. The carriages themselves were filthy; the horses,\r\nwretched; and the coachmen, in tatters, had more the look of beggars\r\nthan that of drivers.\r\n\r\nNow, not only good hackney-coaches, but chariots and cabriolets\r\nlikewise, figure here on the stands; and many of them have an\r\nappearance so creditable that they might even be taken for private\r\nFrench equipages. The regular stipulated fare of all these vehicles\r\nis at present 30 _sous_ a _course_, and the same for every hour after\r\nthe first, which is fixed at 40 _sous_.[1] In 1789, it used to be no\r\nmore than 24. For the 30 _sous_, you may drive from one extremity of\r\nParis to the other, provided you do not stop by the way; for every\r\nvoluntary stoppage is reckoned a _course_. However, if you have far\r\nto go, it is better to agree to pay 40 _sous_ per hour, and then you\r\nmeet with no contradiction. From midnight to six o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the fare is double.\r\n\r\nThe present expense of a job-carriage, with a good pair of horses,\r\n(including the coachman, who is always paid by the jobman) varies\r\nfrom 22 to 24 louis a month, according to the price of forage. If you\r\nuse your own carriage, the hire of horses and coachman will cost you\r\nfrom 12 to 15 louis, which, in 1789, was the price of a job-carriage,\r\nall expenses included.\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_, there were no stands of cabriolets.[2] These\r\ncarriages are very convenient to persons pressed for time; but it\r\nmust be confessed that they are no small annoyance to pedestrians. Of\r\nthis Lewis XV was so convinced, that he declared if he were Minister\r\nof the Police, he would suffer no cabriolets in Paris. He thought\r\nthis prohibition beneath his own greatness. To obviate, in some\r\nmeasure, the danger arising both from the want of foot-pavement, and\r\nfrom the inconsiderate rapidity with which these carriages are not\r\nunfrequently driven, it is now a law that the neck of every horse in\r\na cabriolet must be provided with bells, and the carriage with two\r\nlamps, lighted after dark; yet, in spite of these precautions, and\r\nthe severity which the police exercises against those who transgress\r\nthe decree, serious accidents sometimes happen.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, \"_gare! gare!_\" was the only warning given\r\nhere to foot-passengers. The master, in his cabriolet, first drove\r\nover a person, the servant behind then bawled out \"_gare!_\" and the\r\nmaimed pedestrian was left to get up again as he was able. Such\r\nbrutal negligence now meets with due chastisement.\r\n\r\nAt a trial which took place here the other day in a court of justice,\r\nthe driver of a cabriolet was condemned to three months imprisonment\r\nin a house of correction, and to pay a fine of 100 francs for maiming\r\na carter. The horse had no bells, as prescribed by law; and the owner\r\nof the cabriolet was, besides, condemned, in conjunction with the\r\ndriver, to pay an indemnification of 3000 francs to the wounded\r\ncarter, as being civilly responsible for the conduct of his servant.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the danger of walking in the streets of Paris, such\r\nFrench women as are accustomed to go on foot, traverse the most\r\nfrequented thoroughfares in the dirtiest weather, at the same time\r\ndisplaying, to the astonished sight of bespattered foreigners, a\r\nwell-turned leg, a graceful step, and spotless stockings.\r\n\r\nIf you arrive in Paris without a servant, or (what amounts almost to\r\nthe same thing) should you bring with you a man ignorant of the\r\nFrench language, you may be instantly accommodated with one or\r\nseveral domestics, under the name of\r\n\r\nVALETS-DE-PLACE.\r\n\r\nLike every thing else here, the wages of these job-servants are\r\naugmented. Formerly, their salary was 30 or 40 _sous_ a day: they now\r\nask 4 francs; but, if you purpose to spend a few weeks here, will be\r\nglad to serve you for 3. Some are very intelligent; others, very\r\nstupid. Most of them are spies of the police; but, as an Englishman\r\nin Paris has nothing to conceal, of what consequence is it whether\r\nhis steps are watched by his own _valet-de-place_ or any other\r\n_mouchard_? It is usual for them to lay under contribution all the\r\ntradesmen you employ; and thus the traiteur, the jobman, &c.\r\ncontribute to augment their profits. However, if they pilfer you a\r\nlittle themselves, they take care that you are not subjected to too\r\nmuch imposition from others.--To proceed to a few\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn visiting the French capital, many Englishmen are led into an\r\nerror. They imagine that a few letters of recommendation will be the\r\nmeans of procuring them admission into other houses besides those of\r\nthe persons to whom these letters are addressed. But, on their\r\narrival in Paris, they will find themselves mistaken. The houses of\r\nthe _great_ are difficult of access, and those of the secondary class\r\nscarcely open with more ease than they did before the revolution. If\r\nproper attention be paid to all the letters which a stranger brings,\r\nhe may be satisfied; though the persons to whom he is recommended,\r\nseldom think of taking him to the residence of any of their friends.\r\nTherefore, an English traveller, who wishes to mix much in French\r\nsociety, should provide himself with as many letters of\r\nrecommendation as he can possibly obtain; unless, indeed, he has a\r\ncelebrated name, which, in all countries, is the best introduction;\r\nfor curiosity prompts the higher classes to see and examine the man\r\nwho bears it. The doors of every house will be open to him, when they\r\nare shut against other strangers, and he may soon establish an\r\nintimacy in the first circles. To those who possess not that\r\nadvantage, a Frenchman may be induced to offer a dinner, or two,\r\nperhaps, and return them a few formal visits. He will profess more\r\nthan he performs. In a word, he will be polite, but not familiar and\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, thus circumstanced, finding that he gains no ground,\r\nand is treated with a sort of ceremony, will probably seek other\r\ncompany, dine at the _restaurateurs'_, frequent the _spectacles_, and\r\nvisit the impures: for such was the life our countrymen, in general,\r\nled in Paris before the revolution. Public amusements may, perhaps,\r\nmake him amends for the want of private society. As, from their\r\nastonishing number, they may be varied without end, he may contrive\r\nto pass away his evenings. His mornings will, at first, be employed,\r\nno doubt, in visiting public curiosities; but, after he has\r\nrepeatedly surveyed these scenes of attraction, he will fail in what\r\nought to be the grand object of foreign travel, and return home\r\nwithout having acquired a competent knowledge of the manners of the\r\ncountry. He ought therefore to husband proper French acquaintances,\r\nand keep up a constant intercourse with them, or he will run a risk\r\nof finding himself insulated. Should indisposition confine him to the\r\nhouse for a few days, every one to whom he has been recommended, will\r\nsuppose him gone, he will no longer be thought of; _ennui_ will take\r\npossession of him, and, cursing France, he will wish himself safely\r\nlanded on the shore of Old England.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case with an Englishman who brings letters to Paris,\r\nwhat must be the situation of one who visits this capital entirely\r\nunprovided in that respect? The banker on whom he has a letter of\r\ncredit, may invite him to a dinner, at which are assembled twenty\r\npersons, to all of whom he is a perfect stranger. Without friends,\r\nwithout acquaintances, he will find himself like a man dropped from\r\nthe clouds, amidst six or seven hundred thousand persons, driving or\r\nwalking about in pursuit of their affairs or pleasures. For want of a\r\nproper clue to direct him, he is continually in danger of falling\r\ninto the most detestable company; and the temptations to pleasure are\r\nso numerous and so inviting in this gay city, that it requires more\r\nfortitude than falls to the lot of many to resist them. Consequently,\r\nan untravelled foreigner cannot be too much on his guard in Paris;\r\nfor it will require every exertion of his prudence and discrimination\r\nto avoid being duped and cheated. Above all, he should shun those\r\ninsinuating and subtle characters who, dexterous in administering\r\nthat delicious essence which mixes so sweetly with the blood, are\r\never ready to shew him the curiosities, and introduce him into\r\ncoteries, which they will represent as respectable, and in which the\r\nmistress of the house and her daughters will, probably, conspire to\r\nlighten his pocket, and afterwards laugh at his credulity.\r\n\r\nAs to the reception which the English are likely to meet with here\r\nafter the ratification of the definitive treaty, (if I may be\r\npermitted to judge from personal experience and observation) I think\r\nit will, in a great measure, depend on themselves. Therefore, should\r\nany of our countrymen complain of being treated here with less\r\nattention now than before the revolution, it will, on candid\r\ninvestigation, prove to be their own fault. The essential difference\r\nwill be found to consist in the respect paid to the man, not, as\r\nformerly, in proportion to his money, but to his social worth. The\r\nFrench seem now to make a distinction between individuals only, not\r\nbetween nations. Whence it results that, _cæteris paribus_, the\r\nforeigner who possesses most the talent of making himself agreeable\r\nin society, will here be the most welcome. Not but, in general, they\r\nwill shew greater indulgence to an Englishman, and be inclined to\r\noverlook in him that which they would consider as highly unpardonable\r\nin a stranger of any other country.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions, their most usual exclamation is \"_Les Anglais sont\r\ndes gens bien extraordinaires! Ma foi! ils sont inconcevables!_\" And,\r\nindeed, many Englishmen appear to glory in justifying the idea, and\r\n_astonishing the natives_ by the eccentricity of their behaviour. But\r\nthese _originals_ should recollect that what may be tolerated in a\r\nman of superior talent, is ridiculous, if not contemptible, in one\r\nundistinguished by such a pretension; and that, by thus _posting_\r\ntheir absurdities to the eyes of a foreign nation, they leave behind\r\nthem an impression which operates as a real injury in regard to their\r\nmore rational countrymen. Another circumstance deserves no less\r\nanimadversion.\r\n\r\nIn their first essay of foreign travel, our British youths generally\r\ncarry with them too ample a share of national prepossession and\r\npresumption. Accustomed at home to bear down all before them by the\r\nweight of their purse, they are too apt to imagine that, by means of\r\na plentiful provision of gold, they may lord it over the continent,\r\nfrom Naples to Petersburg; and that a profuse expenditure of money\r\nsupersedes the necessity of a compliance with established forms and\r\nregulations. Instead of making their applications and inquiries in a\r\nproper manner, so as to claim due attention, they more frequently\r\ndemand as a right what they should rather receive as a favour.\r\nFinding themselves disappointed in their vain conclusions, their\r\ntemper is soured; and, being too proud to retract their error, or\r\neven observe a prudent silence, they deal out their impertinence and\r\nabuse in proportion to the number of guineas which they may be able\r\nto squander. Of course, they cannot but view the peculiar habits and\r\ncustoms of all foreign nations with a jaundiced eye, never reflecting\r\nthat in most countries are to be found, either in a moral or a\r\nphysical sense, advantages and disadvantages in which others are\r\ndeficient. _Le_ POUR _et le_ CONTRE, as a well-known traveller\r\nobserves, _se trouvent en chaque nation_. The grand desideratum is to\r\nacquire by travel a knowledge of this POUR _et/i> CONTRE, which, by\r\nemancipating us from our prejudices, teaches us mutual toleration\r\n--for, of every species of tyranny, that which is exercised on things\r\nindifferent in themselves, is the most intolerable. Hence it is less\r\ndifficult to deprive a nation of its laws than to change its habits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: When assignats were in circulation, a single _course en\r\nfiacre_ sometimes cost 600 livres, which was at the rate of 10 livres\r\nper minute. But this will not appear extraordinary, when it is known\r\nthat the depreciation of that paper-currency was such that, at one\r\ntime, 18,000 livres in assignats could be procured for a single\r\n_louis d'or_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A cabriolet is a kind of one-horse chaise, with a\r\nstanding head, and inclosed in front by a wooden flap, in lieu of one\r\nof leather. Behind, there is a place for a footman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 31, 1802._\r\n\r\nIf I mistake not, I have answered most of the questions contained in\r\nyour letters; I shall now reply to you on the subject of\r\n\r\nDIVORCE.\r\n\r\nThe number of divorced women to be met with here, especially among\r\nthe more affluent classes, exceeds any moderate calculation. Nothing\r\ncan more clearly manifest the necessity of erecting some dike against\r\nthe torrent of immorality, which has almost inundated this capital,\r\nand threatens to spread over all the departments.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the indissolubility of marriage in France was\r\nsupposed to promote adultery in a very great degree: the vow was\r\nbroken because the knot could not be untied. At present, divorces are\r\nso easily obtained, that a man or woman, tired of each other, have\r\nonly to plead _incompatibility of temper_, in order to slip their\r\nnecks out of the matrimonial noose. In short, some persons here\r\nchange their wedded partner with as much unconcern as they do their\r\nlinen. Thus, the two extremes touch each other; and either of them\r\nhas proved equally pernicious to morals.\r\n\r\nFormerly, if a Frenchman kept a watchful eye on his wife, he was\r\nreckoned jealous, and was blamed. If he adopted a contrary conduct,\r\nand she was faithless, he was ridiculed. Not unfrequently, a young\r\nmiss, emerged from the cloisters of a convent, where she had,\r\nperhaps, been sequestered, in order that her bloom might not eclipse\r\nthe declining charms of her mother, and who appeared timid, bashful,\r\nand diffident, was no sooner married to a man in a certain rank in\r\nlife, than she shone as a meteor of extravagance and dissipation.\r\nSuch a wife thought of nothing but the gratification of her own\r\ndesires; because she considered it as a matter of course that all the\r\ncares of the family ought to devolve by right on the husband.\r\nProvided she could procure the means of satisfying her taste for\r\ndress, and of making a figure in the _beau monde_, no other concerns\r\never disturbed her imagination. If, at first, she had sufficient\r\nresolution to resist the contagion of example, and not take a male\r\nfriend to her bosom, by way of lightening the weight of her connubial\r\nchains, she seldom failed, in the end, to follow the fashion of the\r\nday, and frequent the gaming-table, where her virtue was sacrificed\r\nto discharge her debts of honour.\r\n\r\nBut what have these _would-be_ republicans to allege as an excuse in\r\ntheir favour? They have no convents to initiate young girls in the\r\narts of dissimulation; no debauched court to contaminate, by its\r\nexample, the wavering principles of the weak part of the sex, or sap\r\nthe more determined ones of those whose mind is of a firmer texture;\r\nnor have they any friendly, sympathizing confessors to draw a spunge,\r\nas it were, over the trespasses hid in a snug corner of their heart.\r\nNo: every one is left to settle his own account with heaven. Yet the\r\nlibertinism which at present reigns in Paris is sufficient to make a\r\ndeep impression on persons the least given to reflection.\r\n\r\n_Il matrimonio_, says the Italian proverb, _è un paradiso o un\r\ninferno_. In fact, nothing can be compared to the happiness of a\r\nmarried couple, united by sympathy. To them, marriage is really a\r\nterrestrial paradise. But what more horrid than the reverse, that is,\r\ntwo beings cursing the fatal hour which brought them together in\r\nwedlock? It is a very hell on earth; for surely no punishment can\r\nexceed that of being condemned to pass our days with the object of\r\nour detestation.\r\n\r\nIf the indissolubility of marriage in France was formerly productive\r\nof such bad consequences; now that the nuptial knot can be loosened\r\nwith so much facility, there can no longer exist the same plea for\r\nadultery. Is then this accumulation of vice less the effect of the\r\ninstitution of divorce in itself, than that of the undigested law by\r\nwhich it was first introduced?\r\n\r\nThe law of divorce was, I find, projected in 1790, under the auspices\r\nof the last Duke of Orleans, who, utterly regardless of the welfare\r\nof the State, wished to revolutionize every thing, solely with a view\r\nto his own individual interest. His object was to get rid of his\r\nwife, who was a woman of strict virtue. This law was decreed on the\r\n20th of September 1792, without any discussion whatever. On the 8th\r\nof Nivôse and 4th of Floréal, year II, (29th of December 1794 and\r\n24th of April 1795) the Convention decreed additional laws, all\r\ntending to favour the impetuosity of the passions. Thus the door was\r\nopened still wider to licentiousness and debauchery. By these laws,\r\nan absence of six months is sufficient for procuring a divorce, and,\r\nafter the observance of certain forms, either of the parties may\r\ncontract a fresh marriage.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to conceive how many hot-headed, profligate,\r\nunprincipled persons, of both sexes, have availed themselves of such\r\nlaws to gratify their unruly passions, their resentment, their\r\navarice, or their ambition. Oaths, persons, or property, are, in\r\nthese cases, little respected. If a libertine finds that he cannot\r\npossess the object of his desires on any other terms, like Sir John\r\nBrute, in the play, he marries her, in order to go to bed to her, and\r\nin a few days sues for a divorce. I have been shewn here a Lothario\r\nof this description, who, in the course of a short space of time had\r\nbeen married to no less than six different women.\r\n\r\n\"Divorce,\" says a judicious French writer, \"is a separation, the\r\nnecessity for which ought to be supported by unquestionable proofs;\r\notherwise, it is nothing more than a legitimate scandal.\"\r\n\r\nThe French often wish to assimilate themselves to the Romans, and the\r\nRoman laws sanctioned divorce. Let us then examine how far the\r\ncomparison can, in this respect, be supported.\r\n\r\n\"Among the Romans,\" continues he, \"the first who availed himself of\r\nthis privilege was Spurius Corbilius, because his wife was steril.\r\nThe second divorce was that of C. Sulpicius, because his wife had\r\ngone abroad with her hair uncovered, and without a veil over her\r\nhead. Q. Anstitius divorced on account of having seen his wife speak\r\nto a person of her own sex, who was reckoned loose in her conduct;\r\nand Sempronius, because his had been to see the public entertainments\r\nwithout having informed him. These different divorces took place\r\nabout a hundred years after the foundation of Rome. The Romans, after\r\nthat, were upwards of five hundred years without affording an\r\ninstance of any divorce. They then were moral and virtuous. But, at\r\nlength, luxury, that scourge of societies, corrupted their hearts;\r\nand divorces became so frequent, that many women reckoned their age\r\nby the number of their husbands.\" To this he might have added, that\r\nseveral Roman ladies of rank were so lost to all sense of shame, that\r\nthey publicly entered their names among the licensed prostitutes.\r\n\r\n\"Marriage,\" concludes he, \"presently became nothing more than an\r\nobject of commerce and speculation; and divorce, a tacit permission\r\nfor libertinism. Can divorce among the French, be considered\r\notherwise, when we reflect that this institution, which seemed likely\r\nto draw closer the conjugal tie, by restoring it to its state of\r\nnatural liberty, is, through the abuse made of it, now only a mean of\r\nshameful traffic, in which the more cunning of the two ruins the\r\nether, in short, a mound the less against the irruptions of\r\nimmorality?\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the opinion of a French writer of estimation on the\r\neffect of these laws: let us at present endeavour to illustrate it by\r\nsome examples.\r\n\r\nA young lady, seduced by a married man, found herself pregnant. She\r\nwas of a respectable family: he was rich, and felt the consequences\r\nof this event. What was to be done? He goes to one of his friends,\r\nwhom he knew not to be overburdened with delicacy, and proposes to\r\nhim to marry this young person, in consideration of a certain sum of\r\nmoney. The friend consents, and the only question is to settle the\r\nconditions. They bargain for some time: at last they agree for 10,000\r\nfrancs (_circa_ £410 sterling). The marriage is concluded, the lady\r\nis brought to bed, the child dies, and the gentleman sues for a\r\ndivorce. All this was accomplished in six months. As such\r\nopportunities are by no means scarce, he may, in the course of the\r\nyear, probably, meet with another of the same nature: thus the office\r\nof bridegroom is converted into a lucrative situation. The following\r\nis another instance of this melancholy truth, but of a different\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nA man about thirty-two years of age, well-made, and of a very\r\nagreeable countenance, had been married three months to a young woman\r\nof uncommon beauty. He was loved, nay almost adored by her. Every one\r\nmight have concluded that they were the happiest couple in Paris;\r\nand, in fact, no cloud had hitherto overshadowed the serenity of\r\ntheir union. One day when the young bride was at table with her\r\nhusband, indulging herself in expressing the happiness which she\r\nenjoyed, a tipstaff entered, and delivered to her a paper. She read\r\nit. What should it be but a subpoena for a divorce? At first she took\r\nthe thing for a pleasantry: but the husband soon convinced her that\r\nnothing was more serious. He assured her that this step would make\r\nher fortune, and his own too, if she would consent to the arrangement\r\nwhich he had to propose to her. \"You know,\" said he, \"the rich and\r\nugly Madame C----: she has 30,000 francs a year (circa £1250\r\nsterling); she will secure to me the half of her property, provided I\r\nwill marry her. I offer you a third, if, after having willingly\r\nconsented to our divorce, you will permit me to see you as my female\r\nfriend.\" Such a proposal shocked her at the moment; but a week's\r\nreflection effected a change in her sentiments; and the business was\r\ncompleted. _O tempora! O mores!_\r\n\r\nBut though many married individuals still continue to break their\r\nchains, it appears that divorces are gradually decreasing in number;\r\nand should the government succeed in introducing into the law on this\r\nsubject the necessary modifications, of course they will become far\r\nless frequent.\r\n\r\nEvery legislature must be aware to what a degree plays are capable of\r\ninfluencing the opinions of a nation, and what a powerful spring they\r\nare for moving the affections. Why then are not theatrical\r\nrepresentations here so regulated, that the stage may conduce to the\r\namelioration of morals? Instead of this, in most French comedies, the\r\nhusband is generally made the butt of ridicule, and the whole plot\r\noften lies in his being outwitted by some conceited spark. Marriage,\r\nin short, is incessantly railed at in such a lively, satirical manner\r\nas to delight nine-tenths of the audience.\r\n\r\nThis custom was also introduced on our stage under the reign of\r\nCharles II; and, not many years ago, it was, I am told, as usual to\r\nplay _The London Cuckolds_ on Lord Mayor's day, as it is now to give\r\na representation of _George Barnwell_ during the Easter holidays.\r\nYet, what is this practice of exhibiting a cuckold in a ridiculous\r\npoint of view, but an apology for adultery, as if it was intended to\r\nteach women that their charms are not formed for the possession of\r\none man only? Alas! it is but too true that some of the French belles\r\nneed no encouragement to infidelity: too soon all scruple is stifled\r\nin their bosom; and then, they not only set modesty, but decency too\r\nat defiance. _Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute_; or, as the same\r\nidea is more fully expressed by our great moral poet:\r\n\r\n  \"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,\r\n  As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;\r\n  Yet, seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n  We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in both the instances which I have adduced, the fault was\r\nentirely on the side of the men; and, in general, I believe this will\r\nprove to be the case. Recrimination, indeed, is loudly urged by our\r\nsex in Paris; they blame the women, with a view of extenuating their\r\nown irregularities, which scarcely know any limits.\r\n\r\nOn a question of a divorce-bill brought on, not long since, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, you may recollect that a member was laughed at, for\r\nasserting that if men expected women to reform, they ought to begin\r\nby reforming themselves. For my part, I conceive the idea to be\r\nperfectly just. Infidelity on the woman's side is, unquestionably,\r\nmore hurtful to society than a failure of the same sort on the man's;\r\nyet, is it reasonable to suppose women to be so exempt from human\r\nfrailty, as to preserve their chastity inviolate, when men set them\r\nso bad an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 3, 1802_.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have at length occurred to recall me to England, and as\r\nthis will, probably, be the last letter that you will receive from me\r\nbefore I have the pleasure of taking you by the hand, I shall devote\r\nit to miscellaneous subjects, and, without studying any particular\r\narrangement, speak of them at random, just as they chance to present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nA fellow-creature, whose care-worn countenance and emaciated body\r\nclaimed a mite from any one who had a mite to bestow, had taken his\r\nstand at the gate-way just now as I entered. The recollection of his\r\ntale of woe being uppermost in my mind, I begin with\r\n\r\nMENDICANTS.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the calamities which all great political convulsions\r\nnever fail to engender, the streets of Paris present not at this day\r\nthat vast crowd of beggars, covered with rags and vermin, by which\r\nthey were formerly infested. This is to be attributed to the partial\r\nadoption of measures for employing the poor; and, doubtless, when\r\nreceptacles come to be established here, according to the salutary\r\nplans introduced into Bavaria by Count Rumford, mendicity will be\r\ngradually annihilated.\r\n\r\nBut, if beggars have decreased in Paris, this is not the case with\r\n\r\nPAWNBROKERS.\r\n\r\nThey seem to have multiplied in proportion to the increase of the\r\nnumber of opportunities afforded for gambling in the lottery, that\r\nis, in the ratio of 21 to 2.[1]\r\n\r\nFormerly, in addition to the public establishment called the _Mont de\r\nPiété_, commissioners were appointed, in different parts of the town,\r\nto take in pledges, and make advances on them previously to their\r\nbeing lodged in that grand repository. There, money was lent on them\r\nat an interest of 10 per cent; and if the article pledged was not\r\nredeemed by a certain time, it was sold by public auction, and, the\r\nprincipal and interest being deducted, the surplus was paid to the\r\nholder of the duplicate. Thus the iniquitous projects of usury were\r\ndefeated; and the rich, as well as the poor, went to borrow at the\r\n_Mont de Piété_. To obtain a sum for the discharge of a debt of\r\nhonour, a dutchess here deposited her diamond ear-rings; while a\r\nwasherwoman slipped off her petticoat, and pawned it to satisfy the\r\ncravings of hunger.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the _Mont de Piété_ still exists; but,\r\ndoubtless, on a different plan; for Paris abounds with _Maisons de\r\nprêt_. On the eve of particular days in each month when the\r\nshopkeepers' promissory notes become due, they here pledge articles\r\nin order to procure the means of making good their payments. But the\r\ncrowd of borrowers is the greatest on the days immediately preceding\r\nthose on which the Paris lottery is drawn; the hucksters,\r\nmarketwomen, porters, retailers of fruit, and unfortunate females,\r\nthen deposit their wearing apparel at these dens of rapacity, that\r\nthey may acquire a share of a ticket, the price of which is fixed so\r\nlow as to be within the purchase of the poorest classes.\r\n\r\nThe lottery being over, till the next drawing, those persons think no\r\nmore of their effects, provided they are within two or three of the\r\nwinning numbers; and thus they gamble away almost every thing\r\nbelonging to them, even to the very clothes on their back. This is so\r\ntrue that it is not, I understand, at all uncommon in Paris, for a\r\nCyprian nymph to send her last robe to the nearest pawnbroker's, in\r\norder to have the chance of a prize in the lottery, and to lie in bed\r\ntill she obtains the means of purchasing another. Nor is this by far\r\nthe worst part of the story.\r\n\r\nThe too credulous followers of Fortune, on finding all their hopes of\r\nsuccess blasted, frequently seek a termination of their misery by\r\nsuicide: and a person of veracity, who made a point of visiting the\r\n_Morne_ almost daily, assured me that he always knew when the lottery\r\nhad just been drawn, by the increased number of dead bodies, there\r\nexposed, of persons who had put an end to their existence.\r\n\r\nThese are facts shocking to relate; but, if legislators will promote\r\ngaming, either by lotteries, or in any other manner, such are the\r\nconsequences to be expected.\r\n\r\nAnother article which has multiplied prodigiously in Paris, since the\r\nrevolution, consists of\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, the only daily papers in circulation here were the _Journal\r\nde Paris_ and the _Petites Affiches_; for the _Gazette de France_\r\nappeared only twice a week. From that period, these ephemeral\r\nproductions increased so rapidly, that, under the generic name of\r\n_Journaux_, upwards of six thousand, bearing different titles, have\r\nappeared in France, five hundred of which were published in Paris.\r\n\r\nAt this time, here is a great variety of daily papers. The most\r\neminent of these are well known in England; such as the _Moniteur_,\r\nthe only official paper, the sale of which is said to be 20,000 per\r\nday; that of the _Journal de Paris_, 16,000; of the _Publiciste_,\r\n14,000; of the _Journal des Débats_, 12,000; of the _Journal des\r\nDéfenseurs de la Patrie_, 10,000; and of the _Clé du Cabinet_, 6,000.\r\nThe sale of the others is comparatively trifling, with the exception\r\nof the _Petites Affiches_, of which the number daily sold exceeds\r\n30,000.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Journals_, which I mentioned in my letter of the\r\n16th of December last, the most esteemed are the _Magazin\r\nEncyclopédique_, edited by MILLIN, the _Annales de Chimie_, the\r\n_Journal des Arts_, the _Journal Polytechnique_, the _Journal des\r\nMines_, the _Journal général des Inventions et des Découvertes_, &c.\r\nI stop here, because it would be useless to attempt to send you a\r\ncomplete list of all the French periodical publications, as, in the\r\nflux and reflux of this literary ocean, such a list cannot long be\r\nexpected to preserve its exactness.\r\n\r\nAmong the conveniences which this city affords in an enviable degree\r\nand in great abundance, are\r\n\r\nBATHS.\r\n\r\nThose of Paris, of every description, still retain their former\r\npre-eminence. The most elegant are the _Bains Chinois_ on the north\r\nBoulevards, where, for three francs, you may enjoy the pleasure of\r\nbathing in almost as much luxury as an Asiatic monarch. Near the\r\n_Temple_ and at the _Vauxhall d'Été_, also on the old Boulevards, are\r\nbaths, where you have the advantage of a garden to saunter in after\r\nbathing.\r\n\r\nOn the Seine are several floating baths, the most remarkable of which\r\nare the _Bains Vigier_, at the foot of the _Pont National_. The\r\nvessel containing them is upwards of 200 feet in length by about 60\r\nin breadth, and presents two tiers of baths, making, on both decks,\r\n140 in number. It is divided in the middle by a large transparent\r\nplate of glass, which permits the eye to embrace its whole extent;\r\none half of which is appropriated to men; the other, to women. On\r\neach deck are galleries, nine feet wide, ornamented with much\r\narchitectural taste. On the exterior part of the vessel is a\r\npromenade, decorated with evergreens, orange and rose trees,\r\njasmines, and other odoriferous plants. By means of a hydraulic\r\nmachine, worked by two horses, in an adjoining barge, the reservoirs\r\ncan be emptied and filled again in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nThe _Bains Vigier_ are much frequented, as you may suppose from their\r\ndaily consumption of two cords of wood for fuel. Tepid baths, at\r\nblood-heat, are, at present, universally used by the French ladies,\r\nand, apparently, with no small advantage. The price of one of these\r\nis no more than 30 _sous_, linen, &c. included.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn to swim, you may be instructed here in that\r\nnecessary art, or merely take a look at those acquiring it, at the\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF NATATION.\r\n\r\nThe Seine is the school where the lessons are given, and the police\r\ntakes care that the pupils infringe not the laws of decency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, as far back as the year 1684, means were proposed\r\nin London to transmit signs to a great distance in a very short space\r\nof time, and that, towards the close of the seventeenth century, a\r\nmember of the Academy of Sciences made, near Paris, several minute\r\nexperiments on the same subject. The paper read at the Royal Society\r\nof London, and the detail of the experiments made in France, seem to\r\nsuggest nearly the same means as those now put in practice, by the\r\ntwo nations, with respect to\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nThe construction of those in France differs from ours in consisting\r\nof one principal pole, and two arms, moveable at the ends. There are\r\nfour in Paris; one, on the _Louvre_, which corresponds with Lille;\r\nanother, on the _Place de la Concorde_, with Brest; a third, on one\r\nof the towers of the church of _St. Sulpice_, with Strasburg; and the\r\nfourth, on the other tower of the said church, which is meant to\r\nextend to Nice, but is as yet carried no farther than Dijon. To and\r\nfrom Lille, which is 120 leagues distant from Paris, intelligence is\r\nconveyed and received in six minutes, three for the question, and\r\nthree for the answer.\r\n\r\nYet, however expeditious this intercourse may seem, it is certain\r\nthat the telegraphic language may be abridged, by preserving these\r\nmachines in their present state, but at the same time allotting to\r\neach of the signs a greater portion of idea, without introducing any\r\nthing vague into the signification.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the public curiosities, which I have described,\r\nParis contains several\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nAmong them, those most deserving of attention are:\r\n\r\nADANSON'S cabinet of Natural History, _Rue de la Victoire_.\r\n\r\nCASAS' cabinet of Models and Drawings, _Rue de Seine, Faubourg St.\r\nGermain_.\r\n\r\nCHARLES'S cabinet of Physics, _Palais National des Sciences et des\r\nArts._\r\n\r\nDENON'S cabinet of Drawings, &c. _Hôtel de Bouillon_, _Rue J. J.\r\nRousseau_.\r\n\r\nFOUQUET'S cabinet of Models of Antique Monuments, _Rue de Lille_, _F.\r\nS. G._\r\n\r\nHAUPOIS' cabinet of Mechanics.\r\n\r\nSUË'S cabinet of Anatomy, _Rue du Luxembourg_.\r\n\r\nTERSAN'S cabinet of Antiquities, _Cloître St. Honoré_.\r\n\r\nVAILLANT'S cabinet of Birds, &c. _Rue du Sépulchre_, _F. S. G._\r\n\r\nVAN-HORREN'S cabinet of Curiosities, _Rue St. Dominique_, _F. S. G._\r\n\r\nI must observe that, to visit these men of science, without putting\r\nthem to inconvenience, it is expedient either to procure an\r\nintroduction, or to address them a note, requesting permission to\r\nview their cabinet. This observation holds good with respect to every\r\nthing that is not public.\r\n\r\nIf you are fond of inspecting curious fire-arms, you should examine\r\nthe _dépôt d'armes_ of M. BOUTET in the _Rue de la Loi_, whose\r\nmanufactory is at Versailles, and also pay a visit to M. REGNIER, at\r\nthe _Dépôt Central de l'Artillerie_, _Rue de l'Université_, who is a\r\nvery ingenious mechanic, and will shew you several curious articles\r\nof his own invention, such as a _dynamomètre_, by means of which you\r\ncan ascertain and compare the relative strength of men, as well as\r\nthat of horses and draught-cattle, and also judge of the resistance\r\nof machines, and estimate the moving power you wish to apply to them;\r\na _potamomètre_, by which you can tell the force of running streams,\r\nand measure the currents of rivers. M. REGNIER has also invented\r\ndifferent kinds of locks and padlocks, which cannot be picked; as\r\nwell as some curious pistols, &c.\r\n\r\nI have, as you will perceive, strictly confined myself to the limits\r\nof the capital, because I expect that my absence from it will not be\r\nlong; and, in my next trip to France, I intend, not only to point out\r\nsuch objects as I may now have neglected, but also to describe those\r\nmost worthy of notice in the environs of Paris.\r\n\r\nIf I have not spoken to you of all the metamorphoses occasioned here\r\nby the revolution, it is because several of them bear not the stamp\r\nof novelty. If the exchange in Paris is now held in the _ci-devant\r\nEglise des Petits Pères_, did we not at Boston, in New England,\r\nconvert the meeting-houses and churches into riding-schools and\r\nbarracks?\r\n\r\nAs the _Charnier des Innocens_, which had subsisted in the centre of\r\nParis for upwards of eight centuries, and received the remains of at\r\nleast ten millions of human beings, was, before the revolution,\r\nturned into a market-place; so is the famous spot where the Jacobin\r\nconvent stood in the _Rue St. Honoré_, and whence issued laws more\r\nbloody than those of Draco, now on the point of being appropriated to\r\na similar destination. The cemetery of St. Sulpice is transformed\r\ninto a Ranelagh. Over the entrance is written, in large letters,\r\nencircled by roses, \"BAL DES ZÉPHYRS,\" and, underneath, you read:\r\n\r\n  _\"Has ultra metas requiescunt\r\n  Beatam spem expectantes.\"_\r\n\r\nAnd on the door itself:\r\n\r\n  _\"Expectances misericordiam Dei.\"_\r\n\r\nI was just going to conclude with _Adieu, till we meet_, when I was\r\nmost agreeably surprised by the receipt of your letter. I am happy to\r\nfind that, through the kind attention of Mr. Mantell of Dover, whose\r\ngood offices on this and other simllar occasions claim my most\r\ngrateful acknowledgments, you have received all the packets and books\r\nwhich I have addressed to you during my present visit to Paris. It is\r\nlikewise no small gratification to me to learn that my correspondence\r\nhas afforded to you a few subjects of deep reflection.\r\n\r\nAs I told you at the time, the task which you imposed on me was more\r\nthan I could accomplish; and you must now be but too well convinced\r\nthat the apprehension of my inability was not unfounded. It may not,\r\nperhaps, be difficult for a man of sound judgment to seize and\r\ndelineate the general progress of the human mind during a determined\r\nperiod; but to follow successively, through all their details, the\r\nramifications of the arts and sciences, is a labour which requires\r\nmuch more knowledge and experience than I can pretend to: nor did\r\nself-love ever blind me so far as to lead me to presume, for a\r\nmoment, that success would crown my efforts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I have said enough to shew that one of the striking\r\neffects of the revolution has been to make the arts and sciences\r\npopular in France. It has rendered common those doctrines which had\r\ntill then been reserved for first-rate _savans_ and genuises. The\r\narsenals of the sciences (if I may use the expression) were filled;\r\nbut soldiers were wanting. The revolution has produced them in\r\nconsiderable numbers; and, in spite of all the disasters and evils\r\nwhich it has occasioned, it cannot be denied that the minds of\r\nFrenchmen, susceptible of the least energy, have here received a\r\npowerful impulse which has urged them towards great and useful ideas.\r\nThis impulse has been kept alive and continued by the grand\r\nestablishments of public instruction, founded during the course of\r\nthat memorable period. Thus, in a few words, you are at once in\r\npossession both of the causes and the result of the progress of the\r\nhuman mind in this country.\r\n\r\nYou may, probably, be surprised that I could have written so much, in\r\nso short a space of time, amid all the allurements of the French\r\ncapital, and the variety of pursuits which must necessarily have\r\ndiverted my attention. Perhaps too, you may think that I might have\r\ndwelt less on some of my least interesting details. I must confess\r\nthat I have, in some measure, subjected myself to such an opinion;\r\nbut, knowing your wish to acquire every sort of information, I have\r\nexerted myself to obtain it from all quarters. To collect this budget\r\nhas been no easy task; to compress it would have been still more\r\ndifficult, and, alas! to have transmitted it, in an epistolary form,\r\nwould have been totally out of my power, but for the assistance of\r\ntwo very ingenious artists, who have not a little contributed to\r\nlighten my labour. Introducing themselves to me, very shortly after\r\nmy arrival, the one furnished me with an everlasting pen; and the\r\nother, with an inexhaustible inkstand.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my good friend. I have obtained a passport for England. My\r\nbaggage is already packed up. To-morrow I shall devote to the\r\nceremony of making visits _p. p. c._ that is, _pour prendre congé_ of\r\nmy Parisian friends; and, on the day after, (_Deo volente_) I shall\r\nbid adieu to the \"paradise of women, the purgatory of men, and the\r\nhell of horses.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the revolution, the Paris lottery is drawn three\r\ntimes in each month, in lieu of twice; and lotteries have also been\r\nestablished in the principal towns of the Republic, namely; Bordeaux,\r\nLyons, Marseilles, Rouen, Strasburg, and Brussels. The offices in the\r\ncapital present the facility of gambling in all these different\r\nlotteries as often every month as in that of Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n_The new organisation of the National Institute, referred to in\r\nLetter XLV of this volume, will be found among the prefaratory matter\r\nin Vol. I, immediately preceding the Introduction._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Paris As It Was and As It Is, by Francis W.
