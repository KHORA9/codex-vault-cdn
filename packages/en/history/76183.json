AN ADVENTUROUS JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe returned to Yedo and the next few weeks were spent in the usual\r\nhumdrum way, transacting routine business, cursing the heat and the\r\nmosquitoes, until towards the end of July, when Sir Harry Parkes and I\r\nstarted for the Island of Yesso; I, with Sir Harry Keppel in his yacht,\r\nthe _Salamis_; my chief in the _Basilisk_. It was a very interesting\r\ntrip, for apart from all else it gave me my first and only sight of the\r\nAinu aborigines. The business part of the trip was concerned with an\r\ninquiry into the commerce of the western coast of Japan, and especially\r\nwith an endeavour to find some suitable port for opening to foreign\r\ntrade. And so it happened that on the 7th of August the _Salamis_, the\r\n_Basilisk_ under Captain Hewitt, with Satow on board, and the surveying\r\nship _Serpent_ (Commander Bullock), were assembled in the harbour of\r\nNanao, a town of Noto on the west coast belonging to the principality of\r\nKaga, the richest noble in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Nanao is partially closed by a small island and Sir Harry\r\nParkes felt that it would be valuable as a port for foreign trade—far\r\nmore useful than Niigata, with its open roadstead and treacherous bar.\r\nAs he was extremely anxious to enter into communication with the clan of\r\nKaga, it was arranged that two of the Prince’s councillors should come\r\nfrom Kanazawa, the capital of the province, to hold a conference. There\r\nwas some delay about this and it was not until Friday, the 9th of August,\r\nthat the meeting took place.\r\n\r\nSir Harry used every endeavour to impress upon the Kaga representatives\r\nthe desirability of entering into friendly relations with foreigners,\r\nas the Princes of Satsuma, Tosa and Uwajima had done; but his arguments\r\nwere of no great avail. Kaga had evidently not yet quite made up his\r\nmind as to which side he would take in the impending struggle; the plea\r\nput forward by his agents as a reason for not opening Nanao as a port\r\nto foreign trade was that if they did so the Government of the Tycoon\r\nwould inevitably seize upon it, and take possession of what had been\r\nthe birthright of Kaga since remote times. The emissaries raised every\r\npossible objection, and the more they opposed the more determined Sir\r\nHarry was to get something out of them. At last, after giving them the\r\nroughest edge of his tongue, which in his case meant a good deal, he said\r\nthat since they were so unfriendly he should send two of his officials,\r\nMr. Satow and myself, to Kanazawa and thence we should travel overland\r\nto join him at Ōsaka. This suggestion, as may be supposed, was not very\r\nfavourably received, and the interview broke up with a little less than a\r\nshow of politeness.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tycoon’s people, officers who had been detailed to help\r\nCommander Bullock on his surveying expedition, heard that Mr. Satow\r\nand I were to undertake this journey overland, they made a great fuss,\r\ndeclared that it was impossible; that they could not be answerable for\r\nour lives, and that on behalf of their Government they must decline\r\nall responsibility. The Tycoon’s writ clearly did not run in such\r\nprovinces as Kaga and Echizen, through which we must pass. But these were\r\nconsiderations which left Sir Harry unmoved.\r\n\r\nStill, though he was determined to gain some knowledge of the west coast,\r\nwhere no foreigners had ever penetrated, and, if possible, to establish\r\nrelations with the clans and people, he was evidently a little nervous,\r\nfor when we were taking leave of him, and the Admiral and Captain Hewitt\r\nwent so far as to express great fear of the dangers which we must face,\r\nhe tried to make out that it was our own foolhardiness which prompted\r\nthe idea. This I repudiated at once, saying that we were quite willing\r\nto obey his orders in the matter, as a question of duty, but that we\r\ncertainly should not have thought of undertaking the journey for a whim,\r\nwhich would not be fair upon our people at home. Sir Harry only laughed.\r\nTo do him justice it was just the sort of trip that he himself would have\r\ndelighted in, for where his own life was concerned he was always as big a\r\ngambler as the ace of spades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR, AGED 28.\r\n\r\n_By Samuel Lawrence._]\r\n\r\nWe landed in the afternoon. The _Salamis_ got up steam and was off. The\r\n_Basilisk_ followed. The _Serpent_ was still lying peacefully at anchor.\r\nThat evening we spent in making ready for our start the next morning.\r\nThe Tycoon’s officers tried hard to persuade us that they must go with\r\nus. This we stoutly resisted; they would have been absolutely worse\r\nthan useless, for they were mere underlings, they could not protect us,\r\nand would simply be spies interfering with any possibility of friendly\r\nintercourse with the local people.\r\n\r\nWe pointed out to them that their duty was to remain with Commander\r\nBullock, under whose orders they at present were. In the end after a good\r\ndeal of whining on their part that if any evil thing happened to us they\r\nwould suffer, they agreed to leave us in peace provided that we would\r\nabsolve them from all responsibility; so at last they went off to the\r\n_Serpent_, after having taken a formal receipt from the Kaga men for our\r\nbodies, certified safe and sound at the time of delivery!\r\n\r\nWe started on the 10th of August. With the Kaga people sulky and still\r\nsore at the dressing which they had received the day before from our\r\nchief, the outset was not encouraging; however, grumpiness is no feature\r\nof the Japanese nature, and no ill-will could for long make a stand\r\nagainst Satow’s pleasant and conciliatory ways, and we were soon on far\r\nbetter terms with our guides than we had any right to expect.\r\n\r\nTwo smart palanquins had been provided for us and ordinary ones for\r\nour two attendants—Satow’s retainer, a Samurai named Noguchi, and my\r\nChinese servant Lin Fu. A guard of twenty men armed with sword and dirk,\r\nlong staves, and a crest of two paddles crossed, the badge of the Maéda\r\nfamily,[1] was to escort us, whether for show or for protection might be\r\nreckoned uncertain. They were, at any rate, of use in steering us through\r\nthe crowds which in every small town, village, or cluster of houses were\r\nhustling for a first place to see the strange wild beasts.\r\n\r\nHot as it was, so soon as we were out of the town we left the cramping\r\ndiscomforts of our palanquins and walked along the pretty valley trending\r\nin a south-westerly direction. The scenery was charming—here a lagoon,\r\nthere a long stretch of seashore, and, above all, on the east the\r\ntowering mountains of Echiu, said to be some ten thousand feet high,\r\nveritable “hills whose heads touch heaven.” Everywhere the characteristic\r\nforest foliage of Japan; and where is foliage more picturesquely\r\nbeautiful?\r\n\r\nWe passed along one stretch of sandy beach fringing a sea the dancing\r\nwavelets of which were as blue as the heaven above them, just the setting\r\nfor one of those old world legends in which the Japanese delight. Such\r\na legend is the story of the invention of the one-stringed lute, which\r\nmight have been dear to Paganini, though it is not played with a bow. It\r\nis true that the scene of it lay far away in another province, but it\r\nseems to fit in here, for it came to my mind as we wandered along the\r\nromantic shore.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, in the dark long ago, there was at the Court of Kiōto\r\na Kugé, or noble, who was dearly loved by the Son of Heaven; but he had\r\nreason to say, “Put not your trust in princes;” like women, they are apt\r\nto change; in the caprice of a moment, the Kugé fell into disgrace and\r\nwas banished to a lonely place called Suma, a distant village occupied by\r\nhumble fisher-folk. Days and days he spent by the seaside, mourning over\r\nthe happiness which seemed to have fled from him for ever. One morning\r\non the beach he spied a water-worn board, a piece of jetsam from some\r\nperished junk which the ebbing tide had left upon the sand, and as he\r\nlooked he wondered, and said to himself, for he was well skilled in art,\r\n“Perhaps even this poor old piece of wreck may have music in it, had I\r\nbut the skill to draw out its soul.” So he pondered and racked his brain\r\nto think how if it were fitted with a string and bridge the intervals\r\nshould be distanced. Remaining buried in thought, he of a sudden saw a\r\nlittle flight of sandpipers who came and settled upon the beach near\r\nhim, making a pattern which seemed to him to have some mystic meaning in\r\nit, and he wondered whether if he were to copy it on his piece of board\r\nit might be the solution of his problem. When he put it to the test he\r\ndiscovered to his joy that he had found the one-stringed lute which to\r\nthis day is known as Sumagoto, the harp of Suma.\r\n\r\nSo with sweet strains he beguiled the weariness of the long, lonely\r\nhours. Hard by was a poor fisherman’s cottage, lowly indeed, but\r\nexquisitely clean and dainty, with a whole garden of dark blue iris in\r\nthe warmly thatched roof. The old fisherman and his wife became very\r\nfriendly with the fallen noble, and their daughter, a lovely maiden of\r\nsixteen, would sit by the hour listening entranced by the sweetness of\r\nhis music. They loved one another and were married, and she brought the\r\nlight of her beauty and grace to charm into happiness the misery of\r\nhis banishment. And so the months sped by until one day there came a\r\nmessenger from the court to say that pity had touched the heart of the\r\nSon of Heaven and the Kugé was to be restored to his former dignities.\r\nBut he was a faithful lover, and took his humble mate with him to Kiōto,\r\nwhere she became a great lady and they lived happily ever after. And that\r\nis the story of the harp of Suma.\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression. Through the great heat we trudged along,\r\nstopping once in a while to rest in the pleasant coolness of some pretty\r\ntea-house, feasting on fragrant melons and those delicious apples which\r\nare a dainty of that countryside. Some of the inns were very attractive\r\nand the people most polite and kindly disposed; we had no reason to\r\ncomplain of our reception in Kaga. The Kaga Samurai is not a fierce\r\nwarrior like the men of Satsuma and Tosa, nor is he an astute politician\r\nlike the leaders of the Chōshiu folk. Those we met seemed to be quiet and\r\npeaceful, perhaps a little bit slow-coaches, rich and prosperous, while\r\ntheir Prince, who, as I have hinted before, was rather inclined to sit\r\nupon the fence, held an important position in the Empire on account of\r\nhis huge wealth.\r\n\r\nOur second day’s journey lay through very pretty scenery, past Takamatsu,\r\na picturesque fishing village on the seashore, to Tsubata, a flourishing\r\nlittle post-town, where we found a capital inn and spent the night\r\nrefreshed by an excellent Japanese dinner.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 12th of August, we started at 7.45 on our third day’s\r\ntramp, which was to bring us to Kanazawa, the Kaga capital. We rested\r\nin a temple at a place called Morimoto, where we had the usual feast of\r\nmelons and apples. The crowds were now beginning to be enormous; our\r\nguides were anxious that we should walk into the city, the white castle\r\nwalls of which were visible peering out of a glorious dark cloud of pine\r\ntrees about a mile away.\r\n\r\nWe, however, had become surfeited of being a raree show at Ōsaka and\r\nelsewhere, and we were conscious that in our shabby travelling clothes\r\nwe should present anything but a dignified appearance, so we tucked\r\nourselves up in our palanquins with the modesty of brides. Hordes of\r\nspectators lined the streets, and even a lotus pond which commanded\r\na good view of a very pretty resting-place which had been prepared\r\nfor us was full of paddlers. The sightseers were of all ages, sorts\r\nand conditions in life, and amongst them we noticed a great number of\r\ncomely maidens, for the ladies of Kaga are good to look upon. A tortuous\r\ncourse brought us to our inn, where we were received with the most\r\ndignified courtesy and all the hospitable politeness of which Japan is\r\nsuch a pattern. Our sitting-room had been strewed with a huge velvet\r\npile carpet, and red lacquer chairs had been brought out of a temple\r\nfor our use, our hosts not realizing that long custom had inured us to\r\nthe native fashion of squatting on the mats. Soon an envoy arrived from\r\nthe Prince, expressing anxiety for our healths on account of the great\r\nheat and regretting that he himself was not well enough to receive us;\r\nI answered, swearing eternal friendship with Japan and especially with\r\nKaga, on behalf of Sir Harry Parkes. A feast was brought in at which the\r\nenvoy presided, and soon the very smart but very uncomfortable chairs\r\nwere discarded and we were hobnobbing with the _saké_ cups according to\r\ntrue Japanese etiquette. Presently the Prince’s doctors arrived offering\r\nmedical attendance, pills and potions, in case we should need them.\r\n\r\nAt that time, be it remembered, the medical profession was still under\r\nthe Chinese influence, and we should hardly have been prepared to\r\nsubscribe to its methods, among which acupuncture and the burning with\r\nmoxa held a high but painful place. So we expressed our gratitude,\r\npleading excellent health as an excuse for not submitting to a\r\nconsultation. A political conversation followed, which was supposed to be\r\nabsolutely confidential, though as it was carried on in the presence of\r\napparently anybody who chose to come in and listen, the maintenance of\r\nits deadly secrecy was not much to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nThat, however, was not our affair; we had nothing to conceal, for the\r\nTycoon’s Government knew perfectly well what was the object of our visit,\r\nand that we should do all in our power to bring about the opening of\r\nNanao to foreign trade. The Kaga people used the old arguments. They\r\nwere perfectly ready to admit foreign trade, but they could not agree\r\nto their harbour being made anything more than an anchorage where goods\r\nmight be landed; the rest would follow—but they repeated that they were\r\nin deadly fear lest the Tycoon should make an attempt to seize it. By the\r\ntime the envoy left we had become excellent friends, and Satow had made\r\narrangements for carrying on communications with Kanazawa from Yedo. A\r\ngreat point gained, for as I have said, the clan was one to be held in\r\nreckoning. Satow even went so far as to offer to take two Kaga men as\r\npupils; two of the clan, we heard, were already studying in England.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our official interview was over we set out to see the town, a\r\nhuge place, hilly and picturesquely planted, of which the size had not\r\nbeen exaggerated. It was said to hold 500,000 inhabitants. We found some\r\nexcellent shops where silks and lacquer and fans (for which the town is\r\nfamous, the sticks being the special secret of a family called Suba) were\r\nto be had at exorbitant prices; but I managed to secure a very ancient\r\npiece of lacquer, one of the three or four best specimens that ever came\r\nin my way, and one or two other treasures. Kutani (“The nine valleys”)\r\nis close to Kanazawa, and as a matter of course we had to buy a few\r\nspecimens of the curious red ware for which it is famous. We also found\r\nsome capital book-shops.\r\n\r\nThe civility and kindness of all the people whom we met was beyond\r\npraise. In the evening we received a message from the _machi-bugiyo_, the\r\nGovernor of the city, begging us to prolong our stay and to make some\r\nexcursions in the neighbouring country. The invitation was so pressing\r\nthat we could not well refuse, and so on the following day, after a\r\nmorning of shopping at prices enhanced by the intermediary of the inn\r\nservants, who could not resist the temptation of a small squeeze, we\r\nstarted on horseback for Kanaiwa, an open roadstead about four miles off.\r\nOur saddles, of European fashion, made of paper in imitation of leather,\r\nand the bridles, were something that must be seen to be believed. The\r\nunshod ponies were as bad as usual, but Japan is not a horsey country.\r\n\r\nTwo resting-places had been made ready to break this five-mile ride,\r\nand another at the end! There was not much to be seen when we reached\r\nour destination—a sandy beach and open sea, with a tiny stream running\r\ninto it. It was not easy to guess why our kind hosts had been so keen to\r\nshow it to us. We got home again before dark. In the evening two of the\r\nPrince’s gentlemen came in for an after-dinner chat. They talked again\r\nabout the possibility of opening Nanao to foreign trade, saying very\r\nsensibly that it would not be well to do anything which might have the\r\nappearance of smuggling, and that it would be best to tell the Bakufu\r\n(Government of the Tycoon) that if foreign vessels were admitted there\r\nwould surely be a certain amount of goods exchanged. We urged them to\r\nwrite in that sense to Yedo. We then started upon general politics. Their\r\nview as to the state of parties at that moment was that the Bakufu ought\r\nto be supported on general principles, but that its power should be kept\r\nwithin bounds. We talked on till late into the night, my conviction\r\nstill being that Kaga had not at that time any determined policy. It was\r\nobvious that there was no leading influential man such as those whom\r\nwe knew in other clans. I handed them a letter of thanks for all the\r\nkindness which we had received, which Satow translated into Japanese; and\r\nthey took their leave with great courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe following morning (August 14) we started off again after a most\r\nfriendly leave-taking, everybody begging us to come again. Our host\r\nbegs us to stop at a medicine shop kept by his father-in-law to buy a\r\nwonderful drug called _shisetsu_, made of nitre and musk, a panacea for\r\nall the ills to which flesh is heir. The crowds were as thick as ever,\r\nwith many very attractive young ladies. From our first resting-place we\r\nlooked back upon the great city where we had been so kindly received,\r\nand saw the castle, typical of a feudalism that was so near its end,\r\nstanding with its high white towers on rising ground, lording it over the\r\nburghers’ houses below, among the pine trees with which the whole town is\r\nplanted. A striking and picturesque view, and a happy memory, the value\r\nof which is enhanced by that patina in which time enwraps all beautiful\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe rest of our journey through the province of Kaga was not very\r\neventful. Wherever we went we were met with the same gracious and\r\nunexpected kindness that had made our stay at Kanazawa so pleasant. We\r\ncould not help being struck by the great prosperity of the country. We\r\npassed through such towns as Mattō, with two thousand houses, Komatsu,\r\nwith two thousand five hundred, all under the mild rule of the Prince of\r\nKaga, and a happier people it would be difficult to find.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th we reached the frontier of Echizen, where to the outspoken\r\nindignation of our Kaga friends, a petty official, a mere understrapper,\r\nhad been sent to meet us. Here again the Kaga people exacted from the\r\nEchizen men a receipt for our bodies. I wonder how it was worded? Item,\r\nreceived, two English officials, sound in wind and limbs, etc.? I should\r\nhave liked to have seen the document.\r\n\r\nIt pretty soon became evident that although the Echizen people were ready\r\nto entertain us, and even to go to considerable expense in so doing, we\r\nmust not look for any real friendship. It was, no doubt, kind to give us\r\nchampagne and to provide smart pages of honour to fan us in the great\r\nheat—small gentlemen who reminded one of the dear little boys who waited\r\nupon the great Lord Cardinal when the wicked jackdaw of Reims stole his\r\nring, but there was no show of civility, and in Fukui, the capital, such\r\npersons of gentle birth as flocked to the temple of Honguanji, where we\r\nwere, to tell the truth, magnificently lodged, only came to crowd the\r\npassages and stare at us as if we had been gorillas. The intentional\r\nrudeness was unmistakable. The Prince of Echizen was at that time\r\nnotoriously opposed to all foreign intercourse, and his feelings were\r\nreflected in the conduct of his people.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th we crossed the Echizen boundary, glad to be quit of an\r\nunfriendly and surly people, who again handed us over against a formal\r\nreceipt to the representatives of Ii Kamon no Kami. On the following\r\nday we reached Nagahama, a place which had been visited by Sir Harry\r\nParkes and his party in May, so we were no longer a novelty and attracted\r\nlittle attention, which was a mercy. Here we were met by an officer of\r\nthe Tycoon with a guard of eighteen of the Bettégumi (foreign guards),\r\nwhich very much robbed the journey of its interest, for under the eyes\r\nand ears of the Bakufu it was of course out of the question to hold any\r\nfamiliar intercourse with the people of the various places through which\r\nwe might pass. This day we came to a place called Yanagosé, where there\r\nwas a curious institution, a _sekisho_, or barrier, which no woman might\r\ngo through without a passport. Talk about women’s rights!\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of August we reached Kasatsu, where we proposed to remain\r\nfor the afternoon to enable me to write up my report, which was bound\r\nto be rather a long affair, for we had gathered together a formidable\r\nbudget of political and commercial information—now, after nearly half a\r\ncentury crowded with stirring events, altogether obsolete, but at that\r\ntime full of interest. Here we met two or three officials with whom Satow\r\nwas acquainted, and with whom, after dinner, we were engaged until past\r\nmidnight in the usual discussions about politics, which, when held with\r\npersons connected with the Bakufu, were as tedious as they were vapid.\r\nMore interesting, and as it turned out more fortunate for us, was the\r\ninterminable wrangle about the road which we were to take on the morrow.\r\nWe had determined on taking the shortest cut to Ōsaka, through Ōtsu, a\r\nlittle town at the further end of the Biwa lake. The Japanese officials\r\nwere equally determined that we should not go to Ōtsu at all, making\r\nevery sort of difficulty, obviously on account of its proximity to Kiōto,\r\nthe sacred city. As a bait they offered to show us the famous temple of\r\nIshiyama, which had been closed to Sir Harry. We were obstinate, Satow\r\nnot a little suspicious at this great eagerness to take us sightseeing,\r\nand quite appreciating what the real object was. The landlord of the\r\ninn put in a word: “If the gentlemen are so eager to obtain commercial\r\ninformation, why don’t they go to see the famous Uji tea-district? That\r\nwill be of great interest to them, whereas there is nothing to see at\r\nŌtsu.” We stuck to our guns, and expressed our unalterable decision to\r\ntake the nearest road by Ōtsu. We told them that we knew quite well what\r\nthey were driving at, and that they had been sent on purpose to play this\r\ntrick upon us; that if they had been candid with us we might have agreed,\r\nbut in the circumstances, No! They seemed very much crestfallen, but\r\nreturned to the charge.\r\n\r\nAt last I lost patience, and turning suddenly round, told them that if\r\nthey would write me an official letter explicitly stating their reasons,\r\nI would go by Uji, if not, guard or no guard, we would go through\r\nŌtsu. After a little grumbling, they agreed to write such a letter,\r\nand went away to draft it. No fewer than three drafts were rejected\r\nas inadmissible, because they stated that we had not the Government\r\npermission to travel, which as diplomatists we had a right to do, and\r\notherwise confused the issue; but at last they brought a satisfactory\r\nletter, in which they said that great complications had arisen at Kiōto\r\non account of Sir Harry’s passing through in May, and they begged us\r\ntherefore as a favour to go by Uji. It was a hard-won triumph for us.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon this midnight parley at Kusatsu at greater length than\r\nwould have been justifiable had it not been for its consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Ōsaka two days later, Noguchi, Satow’s Samurai attendant,\r\nwent to a tea-house in the city in which he overheard a party of men\r\nbelonging to the Tosa clan, in a compartment separated from him by a\r\npaper screen, telling of their disappointment at having the day before\r\nmissed the chance of murdering the two foreigners who were defiling the\r\nneighbourhood of the sacred city. It appeared that a band of four hundred\r\nmen of the Tosa, Satsuma and Chōshiu clans had gone out to Ōtsu to lie in\r\nwait for us. Had we taken the route which we proposed, through Ōtsu, we\r\nshould have been dead men. It was a narrow escape; a very near thing!\r\n\r\nThe fun of the thing was that the Japanese officials, in persuading us to\r\nchange our route, had not the remotest suspicion of what they were saving\r\nus from.\r\n\r\nWeeks afterwards I heard the whole story confirmed by Gotō Shōjirō. He\r\nwas at the time _rusui_, or agent in charge of the _yashiki_ (palace) of\r\nthe Prince of Tosa at Kiōto, and heard of the plot which he did all in\r\nhis power to stop. But his men broke out of the _yashiki_, determined to\r\nwreak their hatred of foreigners on us. Gotō’s name must appear often\r\nin these recollections; he became one of my best friends in Japan, and\r\nrisked his own life in the attack upon the Legation, when we were on our\r\nway to the Mikado’s Court in the following year—as I shall presently\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nAugust 21st.—We left Kusatsu at 5.45 a.m. The heat was appalling; what\r\nwith mosquitoes and discussions we had had but scanty sleep; moreover\r\nwe had for the last day or two had little food, save rice with tea,\r\nof which we could not eat our fill, for the condiments with which the\r\nJapanese encourage their appetite for rice were as salt as brine, and to\r\nus impossible. Partly by river, and partly on the tramp, stopping every\r\nnow and then to wash out our mouths, through beautiful scenery with a\r\nglorious view of the great plain in which lie Kiōto and Fushimi—the\r\nplace of the thrilling memories of the civil war—we reached Uji at four\r\no’clock, very much done up with the heat and very tired.\r\n\r\nAs for the famous Temple of Ishiyama, which was to be the reward of our\r\nlistening to the blandishments of our friends of the night before, it\r\nhad been hermetically sealed to us, and all our knocking at the door\r\nbrought no answer. Seven years afterwards, on board a steamer in the\r\nPacific, I met a Japanese gentleman who had been present and had watched\r\nour discomfiture and vain knockings. We bought a little tea at Uji, as\r\na matter of course; and at six o’clock got into a comfortable houseboat\r\nin which we drifted down the stream, resting and looking back upon the\r\nentrancing view. Toward morning we fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAugust 22nd at 5.30 a.m. we were in sight of the glorious old Castle of\r\nŌsaka, and landing at six, took up our quarters in our old temple in\r\nthe Nakadéramachi. So our venturesome eleven days’ journey came to an\r\nend; it had been intensely interesting and exciting. We never knew what\r\nmight happen; when we lay down at night we blessed our luck that there\r\nhad been no mischance, and when the morning came we pinched ourselves to\r\nsee whether we were really still alive: there were so many wandering\r\nanti-foreign fanatics throughout the country, against whom even our kind\r\nKaga friends could not have protected us! However, it all ended well, and\r\nwe were successful in gaining all the information that our chief wanted.\r\nUnfortunately the interest of our expedition paled before a tragedy. For\r\nat five Sir Harry Parkes arrived with the news of the cruel murder of two\r\nbluejackets of H.M.S. _Icarus_. They had been literally hacked to pieces\r\nby a party of brawling Samurai. These poor fellows’ fate brought home to\r\nus the danger to which we had so nearly fallen victims.\r\n\r\nThis murder led to endless interviews and discussions, which were\r\ncomplicated by the fact that our people were on the wrong tack. There was\r\na suspicion that the murderers were Samurai of the Tosa clan—a suspicion\r\nborn of the fact that a small steamer and a sailing vessel belonging to\r\nTosa had slipped secretly out of Nagasaki harbour before daylight on the\r\nmorning after the crime had been committed. It was afterwards proved that\r\nthey belonged to a quite different clan, which was duly punished later.\r\nBut the chief murderer had previously committed suicide by _hara-kiri_.\r\n\r\nThe discussions served to make us better acquainted and increased our\r\nrespect for Gotō Shōjirō, who represented his Prince and who proved\r\nhimself to be a man of first-rate ability, quite able to hold his own\r\nagainst our rather peppery chief—not an easy man to discuss matters with.\r\nHe turned out to be one of the three or four ablest men who engineered\r\nthe revolution. Like the famous Saigo, of Satsuma, and others of the\r\nleaders in the various clans, Gotō expressed himself as keenly anxious to\r\nestablish a Gi-ji-in, or parliament. That did not come about until some\r\neighteen months later, and when it did ripen into being it turned out to\r\nbe a very embryonic affair.\r\n\r\nMercifully for Japan, speech-making had never played the same part in her\r\npublic life that it has done in some other countries, and the Parliament\r\nstarted more like a debating society in a public school than a grave\r\nassembly of legislators, which, as a matter of fact, they were not. They\r\nmight register their opinions, but they could not enact laws.\r\n\r\nAugust 31st.—Satow and myself had been invited by the Prince of Awa\r\nto go and pay him a visit at his castle in the Island of Shikoku (“the\r\nfour countries,” so called from the principalities of Awa, Tosa, Sanuki\r\nand Iyo into which it was divided). Had the visit taken place as it was\r\noriginally meant, we should no doubt have been able over the wine-cups\r\nto gather a good deal of information as to the attitude of the four\r\nclans in the crisis, together with a good many particulars in regard to\r\nthe personalities of their leading men. But unfortunately at the last\r\nmoment Sir Harry Parkes insisted on going too, with the Admiral and\r\ntheir respective staffs, in the _Salamis_ and the _Basilisk_; so the\r\nwhole expedition was spoilt, and degenerated into a sort of official\r\ndemonstration, at which the usual stale old political platitudes were\r\nserved up—perfectly useless discussions, in which sincerity was apt to\r\nplay a very meagre part on both sides. The weather, moreover, played us\r\nevery conceivable trick by which to make us uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, however, was very kind and courteous, and he had prepared\r\na most amusing theatrical entertainment for us, in which his retainers\r\nacted with great spirit. They were dressed in the long trousers worn\r\nat Court, but did not wear the _yéboshi_ (black lacquer cap). The plot\r\nof the first piece, which consisted of three characters, the master, a\r\nservant and a guest, was very funny. The master tells his servant to\r\nimitate him in everything that he does, and the servant takes the order\r\nliterally, and passes on to the guest everything that the master says to\r\nhim. The enraged master cuffs the servant, who passes the thrashing on to\r\nthe guest, and so it goes on—a series of practical jokes like the “spill\r\nand pelt” scene in a pantomime, until the master’s patience is exhausted\r\nand he finally kicks the servant out.\r\n\r\nThen came what was a sort of Oriental first-cousin to Offenbach’s _Les\r\nDeux Aveugles_. A man advertises for persons deprived by nature of their\r\nsenses or limbs to enter his service. In answer to this there arrive a\r\nlame man, a dumb man, and a blind man—all these parts capitally acted.\r\nThese three cripples are ruined gamblers who have adopted their disguises\r\nas beggars to get employment. The great man accepts them, and having\r\nplaced them in charge of three storehouses, goes out. The men recognize\r\none another and propose to go to the storehouse where the _saké_ is\r\nkept and have a drink, after which they may divide the money in the\r\ntreasure-house. Of course they get roaring drunk, and by the time the\r\nmaster comes back each has forgotten his part. The blind man becomes\r\ndumb, the lame man blind, and the dumb man is afflicted with deafness.\r\nThe exposure of the impostors is full of fun.\r\n\r\nAfter the play—the wine-cup and bibulous affection. The Prince of Awa\r\nswears that he is the Admiral’s son and elder brother to Sir Harry\r\nParkes; Awaji no Kami, the Prince’s son, claims intimate relationship\r\nwith Satow.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was a review of some five hundred men in a sort of\r\ntatterdemalion European dress, some with boots, some without, those who\r\nhad them being as “justly vain” as Sir Plume “of amber snuff-box and the\r\nnice conduct of a clouded cane.” The drill was capital.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I left for Yedo in the _Salamis_ with the Admiral. Satow\r\nwent to Sasaki in Tosa with Sir Harry to investigate the case of the\r\n_Icarus_ murders. The Tosa people, who, as I have said, were ultimately\r\nproved to be innocent, with Gotō as spokesman, took up a very dignified\r\nposition. Yōdo (the _de facto_ ruler of the clan, though he had nominally\r\nbecome _inkiyō_ (retired) whom Satow visited) declared that if his men\r\nwere proved guilty he would punish them; if they were innocent nothing\r\nshould stir him from his line of conduct. It must have been galling to\r\nSir Harry to be told by Gotō that he was allowing his temper to get the\r\nbetter of his discretion. A dignified demeanour is the only attitude\r\nto observe with the Japanese, who, whatever their faults may be, are\r\ngentlemen to their finger-tips. Bluster does not succeed, but that was a\r\nlesson which our chief, with all his great qualities, never learned, and\r\nin this case he was completely worsted.\r\n\r\nSatow remained at Nagasaki till the 7th of November, so I was all alone\r\nat Yedo in my little temple Monriuin. As a precaution I had the walks\r\nall round the garden strewn with cockle-shells to sound an alarm in the\r\nevent of there being any unwelcome visitors after dark. One night I was\r\nawakened about twelve o’clock by the crunching of my faithful guardian\r\ncockles. I jumped up and lighted candles and lamps, roused the servants,\r\ngave my sword and revolver to my Chinese servant, Lin Fu, upon whom I\r\ncould depend, and stood at the chief door with my Spencer rifle. The\r\nruffians, seeing that we were ready for them, made off. There were five\r\nor six of them, as I knew, for it had been raining heavily and the\r\nfollowing morning I found the marks in the grass where they had slid in a\r\nsitting position down the little hill, which was deeply scored with their\r\nposteriors and heels—mighty unpleasant! I was too near the evilly-reputed\r\nwine-shops of Shinagawa, famous like the wynds of Old Edinburgh for\r\nbrawls between the clans, and as the haunts of the Jō-i, the fanatics\r\nopposed to foreign intercourse.\r\n\r\nAnother time, as I was leaving home in the morning to go to the\r\nLegation, I saw the dead body of a Samurai lying in a pool of blood\r\noutside my gate. It was covered with a piece of matting, but the head\r\nhad been carried off to be deposited, according to the strict rules of\r\n_Kataki-uchi_ (vendetta), upon the grave of an enemy killed by last\r\nnight’s victim in some previous quarrel.\r\n\r\nThese were quite everyday occurrences in the Yedo of what the Japanese\r\nnow call “the olden time” (_mukashi_)—that is the period before the\r\nrevolution, only forty-eight years ago!\r\n\r\nMeantime, although there was no great outward show politically, the\r\nunderground fires of revolution were silently gathering strength. The\r\nTycoon had resigned his office—in fact abolished it—though he still in\r\nsome inconsistent way claimed to be conducting affairs, and of course\r\nremained at the head of the Tokugawa clan. The Daimios, with Satsuma,\r\nChōshiu and Tosa at their head, were said to be arming, and even to have\r\nestablished a camp at Ōsaka. The Tosa people asserted that the Tycoon,\r\nin his resignation, had only followed the advice contained in a memorial\r\nfrom their clan, dated in October, which they showed to Satow. The\r\ndocument advocated the establishment of a Parliament consisting of an\r\nupper and lower house, the erection of schools of science and learning\r\nin the great cities, and the negotiation of new foreign treaties. The\r\nemissaries of the Daimios were more than ever keen to obtain instruction\r\nin Parliamentary procedure. They were evidently all anxiety to stand well\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD JAPAN.\r\n\r\n_From a water-colour drawing by C. Wirgman._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nJAPAN. CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November at daylight, Satow and I, in our usual characters\r\nas diplomatic stormy petrels, sailed for Ōsaka to make all preparations\r\nfor the opening of that city and Hiōgo on the first day of that new year\r\nwhich was to come big with the birth of a new power and fraught with\r\nevents as momentous, perhaps, as any that the history of the world has\r\nseen. We reached Ōsaka on the 3rd of December, and were at once plunged\r\nin the political whirlpool. Besides that we had to prepare quarters\r\nfor the Minister and his staff and the mounted escort, with fifty men\r\nof the 9th Regiment. Much building of palisades, bonded warehouses,\r\ncustom houses, etc., was going on at what was to be the future foreign\r\nsettlement. This was going a little too fast, and we had to put a stop\r\nto any further work until the Ministers should arrive. They might have\r\na good deal to say upon the subject, especially as to the palisades,\r\nwhich were not a very encouraging indication of the intentions of the\r\nGovernment to promote intercourse between West and East.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th we had an interview with members of the Tycoon’s Council of\r\nState who were on their way to Yedo, and whom he had ordered to see us.\r\nWe did not get much information out of them except that the Tycoon’s\r\nresignation was merely the carrying out of an intention formed long ago.\r\nWe were not convinced, nor were we shaken in our belief that he had been\r\ndriven to it by the persistent attitude of the clans.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December we had to leave for Hiōgo in order to see what\r\npreparations were being made there for the great event. We found that\r\nthe people were in high spirits at the prospect of the opening of the\r\nport. In Kōbé, where the foreign settlement was to be, there had been\r\nseven days of feasting and merry-making, and there had been processions\r\nof people dressed in red crape with carts which were supposed to carry\r\nearth for the site of the new settlement. Similar fêtes were in prospect\r\nin the town of Hiōgo itself. The people obviously saw that foreign trade\r\nwould spell prosperity for them.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to Ōsaka on the 13th, we found the city in an uproar\r\nof joy and excitement. It appeared that all this was in honour of a\r\nmiraculous shower which had recently taken place of slips of paper\r\nbearing the titles of the Gods of Isé—the ancestral shrine of Old Japan\r\nand the chief place of the Shintō cult. Thousands and thousands of happy\r\nfanatics were dancing along the streets dressed in holiday garb of red\r\nand blue crape and carrying red lanterns on their heads, shouting till\r\nthey must have been hoarse, “I ja nai ka, i ja nai ka!” “How delightful,\r\nhow delightful!” The houses were decorated with many-coloured cakes,\r\noranges, silken bags, emblematic ropes of straw such as are hung before\r\nthe Shintō shrines, and a profusion of flowers.\r\n\r\nIt was a weird and wonderful sight, such as, maybe, will never be seen\r\nagain; and yet folk-lore and old reverences die hard. Even though all\r\nthis should be _mukashi_, as much so as the mysteries of Stonehenge are\r\nto us, one may hope that it may yet have some life in it. “Le respect du\r\npassé est la piété filiale des peuples,” was a fine saying of the Duc de\r\nBroglie; one which, in these degenerate days, I never weary of quoting,\r\nand we foreigners must not forget what the Japanese owe to the Yamato\r\nDamashii, the spirit of old Japan. It is upon the legends of the Shintō\r\nthat it is founded. Then let the simple folk, “the hundred names,” dance\r\nlike David before the Ark, in honour of showers of paper, for to them\r\nthey mean the sacred traditions of a glorious past, and upon these is\r\nbased a heroism before which the world has bowed its head in admiration.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were we back in Ōsaka than the old political conversations\r\nbegan again. Satsuma, Chōshiu, Tosa, Uwajima and Geishiu were solid for\r\na change; other Daimios inclined to join, but vacillating. One thing we\r\nwere clearly given to understand: if the intrigues now going on at Kiōto\r\nfailed, the Daimios would revert to the old game of murderous attacks\r\nupon foreigners, not from any dislike of foreign intercourse, of which\r\nthey were indeed in favour, but simply in order to embroil the Tycoon\r\nwith the Treaty Powers. The obvious answer to this was that whatever\r\nmight happen in that way, the Tycoon could not be held responsible for\r\nthe action of persons over whom he, as they admitted, had no control!\r\n\r\nThe arrival of leading men in Ōsaka, so near Kiōto, at this time was very\r\nsignificant. Saigo, the famous Satsuma general, who died years afterwards\r\nby _hara-kiri_ in the rebellion of his clan, and Gotō Shōjirō were very\r\nconspicuous figures. The latter talked a great deal about the scheme to\r\nmurder Satow and myself at Ōtsu in August and gave us many particulars.\r\nIt was a merciful escape.\r\n\r\nLetters from Yedo showed that there the demolition of the Bakufu was an\r\naccomplished fact. On the 20th we had an interview with Ito Shunské,\r\nwhich is worth noting because it was one of our first communications\r\nwith a man, then in a humble position, who afterwards, as Prince Ito,\r\nbecame the most powerful political personage in Japan. He told us that\r\nwar was quite inevitable, the object being to deprive the Tycoon of his\r\nterritory, which was far too large for the peace of the country. He would\r\nhave preferred to put off the arrival of the Foreign Representatives\r\nand the opening of the ports, but when he was told that this was out of\r\nthe question, he said that in that case the opening must take place in\r\norder to keep foreigners quiet whilst the plans for the reformation of\r\nthe country went on. We both warned him that if, in the course of the\r\nrevolution, foreigners were attacked or any attempt should be made to\r\nupset the Treaties, the Japanese would be bringing upon themselves a very\r\ngrave responsibility. He admitted the force of this and promised to keep\r\nSatow posted as to any movement that might be on foot.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Sir Harry Parkes arrived with the other members of the\r\nLegation, and took possession of the quarters which we had prepared in\r\na great tumbledown _Yashiki_ behind the castle; not perhaps the safest\r\nplace in case trouble should arise, for fighting would be focussed upon\r\nthe stronghold, but all things considered, the best that could be had.\r\n\r\nSatow and myself were now very much more under observation than we had\r\nbeen, and it was not easy to keep up our communications with the Daimios\r\nparty. The Tycoon’s guard kept a pretty sharp look-out, but we managed\r\nto defeat them by climbing over the walls of the Legation buildings at\r\nnight, and joining our friends outside, who led us by tortuous ways to\r\none or other of their _Yashikis_ where we were able to confer with them\r\ncomfortably. In this way, like a couple of boys breaking out to rob a\r\nneighbour’s apple-orchard, we contrived to keep our chief posted as to\r\nwhat was going on; practical, but hardly very dignified. The end must be\r\nheld as justification for the means.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of January, 1868, was really the birthday of the new\r\ndispensation. Up to this time, for many months, the country had been in\r\na fever of unrest; there had been plots and counterplots, conspiracies\r\nand intrigues of which I have tried to give some indication, though\r\ntheir details would fill volumes; there had been the resignation, or\r\nsham resignation, of the Tycoon; there had been a gradual massing of\r\ntroops near Kiōto: the Prince of Chōshiu, who had been in disgrace, had\r\nbeen forgiven, save the mark! by the Tycoon, and the Prince of Aidzu\r\nwas said to have resigned the guardianship of the palace as a sign of\r\nhis resentment of this leniency—but the report was not true, as will\r\nbe seen presently: the witch’s cauldron was seething and boiling, but\r\nso far the peace had not actually been broken; the Daimios were still\r\nprotesting that their object was only to curb the Tycoon and restrain an\r\noverwhelming power which had been abused.\r\n\r\nWe began to feel that the dogs of war were loose. We learned that the\r\nPrince of Satsuma had proposed the abolition of the Tycoon and the\r\nother old officers of State, substituting for them something analogous\r\nto a Constitutional Government with Secretaries of State and the whole\r\nmachinery of an executive; a proposal in which we could not but recognize\r\nthe reflection of hints which, at his request, Satow and I had given\r\nto Gotō Shōjirō. Satsuma’s views met with great opposition, many men\r\ndreading such Radical ideas as perhaps likely to end by threatening\r\nthe kingship of the Mikado himself. Our informant said that this was no\r\nmatter for argument, it must be decided by war. The Tycoon, he admitted,\r\nwould raise no difficulties, being bent on preserving the peace of the\r\ncountry at whatever cost to himself. But he could not control his people.\r\n\r\nThings were now moving at lightning speed and every day brought some\r\nnew development. Rumours came flying fast and furious—some true, some\r\ngarbled, some false—but all pointing in one direction.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January an official of the Bakufu came to tell us that the\r\nTycoon had left Kiōto and was on his way to Ōsaka to have an interview\r\nwith M. Roches. This naturally was a mere pretext; as a matter of fact he\r\nwas leaving Kiōto because his office had come to an end. The Aidzu men\r\nwho had charge of the nine gates of the Mikado’s palace had been ousted\r\nby Imperial command and the sacred precincts and the Emperor himself were\r\nin the hands of the coalition Daimios. Practically the end had come.\r\n\r\nSatow and I went out to see what was going on. We found the streets\r\nbeing patrolled by soldiers with field pieces placed so as to sweep\r\nthe approaches to the castle. It was bitterly cold and the men had\r\ntheir heads wrapped in mufflers—a curious addition to the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of uniform. The Aidzu people, who were posted about, told\r\nus that the reason for the Tycoon’s withdrawal was his unwillingness to\r\nallow fighting to take place near the precincts of the palace—a sort of\r\n“Star Chamber” reason. They said that Satsuma wanted to do everything by\r\nforce—so like that martial clan! Tosa, on the other hand, was all for\r\nproceeding by reason; but in either case the object was the same. As for\r\nGotō’s scheme for a Constitution, Japan was not ripe for that: the change\r\nwould be too sudden and too violent.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon it became evident that the Tycoon was now close by. We\r\nsaw wonderful groups of men clad in armour. They were very civil and full\r\nof patriotic declarations of readiness to die in the Tycoon’s cause, and\r\nindeed, as events proved, these were no empty boasts. They were beaten,\r\nbut not before hundreds of Tokugawa men had died the death of heroes.\r\nPresently the bugles sounded and we saw a long procession of troops\r\ncoming towards the castle.\r\n\r\nA more extravagantly weird picture it would be difficult to imagine.\r\nThere were some infantry armed with European rifles, but there were also\r\nwarriors clad in the old armour of the country carrying spears, bows and\r\narrows, falchions, curiously shaped, with sword and dirk, who looked\r\nas if they had stepped out of some old pictures of the Gem-Pei wars in\r\nthe Middle Ages. Their _jimbaoris_, not unlike heralds’ tabards, were\r\nas many-coloured as Joseph’s coat. Hideous masks of lacquer and iron,\r\nfringed with portentous whiskers and moustachios, crested helmets with\r\nwigs from which long streamers of horsehair floated to their waists,\r\nmight strike terror into any enemy. They looked like the hobgoblins of a\r\nnightmare. Soon a troop of horsemen appeared. The Japanese all prostrated\r\nthemselves and bent their heads in reverent awe. In the midst of the\r\ntroop was the fallen Prince, accompanied by his faithful adherents, Aidzu\r\nand Kuwana. The Prince himself seemed worn and dejected, looking neither\r\nto the right nor to the left, his head wrapped in a black cloth, taking\r\nnotice of nothing. Some of those with him recognized us and returned\r\nour salutes. It was a wild and wonderful sight and one of the saddest\r\nthat I ever beheld. At the gate all dismounted, according to custom—save\r\nonly the War Lord himself; he rode in, a solitary horseman. It was the\r\nlast entry of a Shōgun into the grand old castle which had come into the\r\nheritage of the Tokugawa by one tragedy, and was to pass out of their\r\npossession by another. In each case fire, “the calamity of the dancing\r\nhorse,”[2] played its cruel part.\r\n\r\nSir Harry Parkes at once asked for an appointment to see the Shōgun on\r\nthe following day, which was declined; but hearing that M. Roches was\r\nto be received, our chief was not to be held; he insisted upon making\r\nhis way in, with Satow and me—to the outspoken disgust of the French\r\ncolleague—and the two ministers were received together—not without some\r\nrecriminations and angry words between them. The Shōgun, or rather\r\nex-Shōgun, as he now was, seemed greatly depressed; he was a very\r\ndifferent man from the handsome, proud noble who had received us with\r\nso much dignity in the preceding May. The many troubles, sorrows and\r\nindignities which he had undergone were written in his face. He repeated\r\nthe old story of his having left Kiōto from patriotic motives, in order\r\nto avoid civil war, which would be waged almost in the sacred presence\r\nof the Emperor. He said that he should remain in Ōsaka, but did not\r\nknow whether he would be attacked. As to the existing order of things,\r\nhe said that the Mikado nominally ruled, but that Kiōto was occupied by\r\nan unruly set of men, who did nothing but quarrel among themselves and\r\nhad no notion of governing. The two ministers applauded his action—the\r\nFrenchman in fulsome language, Sir Harry in more measured terms. There\r\nwas obviously nothing much to be drawn from him, and as he complained of\r\nfeeling tired, the rather barren conference came to an end.\r\n\r\nThat evening Sir Henry Keppel, who, with my old friend, his flag\r\nlieutenant (now Admiral Sir Henry Stephenson, Black Rod), and that\r\ngrand sailor and gallant gentleman, Captain Chandos Scudamore Stanhope,\r\nof H.M.S. _Ocean_,[3] was on shore, insisted on my going off with him\r\nto Hiōgo to sleep on board the _Rodney_, and hear the band play. It\r\nwas blowing great guns, and I felt pretty certain that the perfidious\r\nbar which I knew only too well would be dangerous if not impassable. I\r\ntold this to the Admiral, but he pooh-poohed the objections of a mere\r\nlandsman, and said that I “did not know what a steam-launch could do.” So\r\noff we went with a second boat in tow. Darkness set in, and by the time\r\nwe reached the mouth of the river it was black night.\r\n\r\nThe wind was howling like Bedlam; the sea was terrific; now and then\r\nthere was a rift in the clouds, and we could see the mockery of the\r\nwicked moon shining luridly through the ugly green waves which towered\r\nover us, hungry to swallow us up; we expected to go under any minute.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that we must cast off the boat which we were\r\ntowing; there was no other chance for her, and our desertion saved her.\r\nCaptain Stanhope took the helm, keeping the launch’s bows to the beating\r\nseas; as he stood in the stern with his teeth set, a grim statue, as if\r\nhe had been carved in stone, he was splendid. There was one specially\r\nevil moment, when the Admiral turned to me and said: “I don’t know what\r\nyou think, but I have never seen death so near.” This coming from the\r\nhero of the Fatshan Creek—when his coxswain had his telescope driven\r\ninto his stomach, his boat was sunk and five of his crew killed—the old\r\nsea warrior, who had survived heaven knows how many deadly fights with\r\nthe wild head-hunters and pirates of Borneo—was not reassuring. Stanhope\r\ngave a sort of ghastly grin, but he went on doing battle with the demons\r\nin the waves; it was a tough fight, but at last he managed to bring us\r\nalongside a French man-of-war, the _Laplace_, which was lying in the\r\nroads, with H.M. surveying ship _Sylvia_ about a mile away. We hung on to\r\nthe Frenchman; the officers were very kind to us; they lowered sardines\r\nand biscuits and mulled claret to us—the latter most acceptable, for we\r\nwere up to our waists in water, drenched to the skin and half-frozen.\r\n\r\nThey tried to send a chair down to hoist us on board, but the sea was\r\nrunning so high that it was impossible; the chair and its occupant would\r\nhave been dashed to pieces against the ship’s side. So there we remained,\r\nbeing played cup and ball with for five hours; at last there came a\r\nslight—a very slight—lull in the storm; the Admiral determined to avail\r\nhimself of it in order to make the _Sylvia_; it was a critical moment,\r\nfor we had to turn in the trough of the sea and a second too late would\r\nhave been fatal; had we shipped a wave our fires would have gone out,\r\nand then! But Stanhope was not the man to make a mistake; we danced on\r\nto the curled crest of the preceding wave, and after a struggle for life\r\nreached the _Sylvia_; by that time there was some further abatement of\r\nthe weather, and we were able to be hoisted up one by one into safety and\r\nthe joy of sleep between hot blankets, after a steaming and strong glass\r\nof grog.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Hiōgo on the next afternoon, we were met by the news that\r\nthe United States Admiral Bell, with his flag lieutenant and all his\r\nboat’s crew, had been drowned on the bar in the same storm. The English\r\nnewspapers made a muddle between the two Admirals, and in London we were\r\nreported lost.[4]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I had to go back to Ōsaka with despatches for Sir Harry. I\r\nwas sent in a steam launch commanded by Lieutenant Leventhorpe. The storm\r\nhad hardly abated. The wind was still raging furiously. The impression of\r\nthe night of the 8th, heightened by the death of Admiral Bell, was upon\r\nme, and I confess that I did not like it! But we all had on life-belts,\r\nand we got past the bar in safety. Still our troubles were not over, for\r\nas we neared the castle, we saw that one of the bridges was crowded with\r\na very hostile mob, some of whom were making ready to sink our launch\r\nwith a huge block of stone. In the nick of time our coxswain saw it, gave\r\nthe boat’s nose a twist, and the great rock splashed harmlessly into\r\nthe waves within a couple of feet of us. Some forty years later I had a\r\nvery nice letter from that good fellow, who had done us such excellent\r\nservice, asking me whether I remembered the occurrence, and the glee with\r\nwhich I called out to him, “Well done, coxswain!”\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Ōsaka on the evening of the 10th I found that on\r\nthat afternoon a conference had taken place between the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives and the ex-Shōgun, as he now was, on the invitation\r\nof the latter, who was desirous of making a statement on the present\r\ncondition of affairs. In the meantime it should be mentioned that\r\nfollowing the example of his own officials, he was no longer addressed by\r\nhis former high-sounding titles, but simply as Uyé-sama, which I should\r\ntranslate by “Highness.”\r\n\r\nGreat interest attaches to this address, for it contained internal\r\nevidence that it was his own composition and new even to those of his\r\nadvisers who were present, for the gentlemen of the Foreign Office,\r\nwho feared to see their occupation gone and themselves reduced to the\r\ncondition of “the hundred names,” could hardly suppress their surprise\r\nand joy when he announced that he would continue to direct foreign\r\naffairs. Their pleasure, however, was fated to be short-lived. The\r\nstatement ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    “My ancestor, Iyéyasu, settled the form of government in Japan\r\n    in its fundamental principles and all its details; for upwards\r\n    of two centuries there has been no one, from the Emperor down\r\n    to the humblest of the people, who has not paid respect to\r\n    his virtue, or who has not reaped the benefit of his good\r\n    intentions. But the world has changed. Since the conclusion\r\n    of the treaties with Foreign Powers it has been impossible\r\n    not to be aware of certain shortcomings in laws which, up to\r\n    that time, had been held to be all-sufficient and good. From\r\n    the first moment when I succeeded my predecessor I felt this,\r\n    and determined, in collaboration with Kiōto, to introduce a\r\n    reformation of these laws. Inspired by an honest love for my\r\n    country, and for the people, I laid down the Power which I had\r\n    inherited, and with the understanding on the other hand that I\r\n    should call a meeting of all the Princes of the country, with\r\n    a view to discussing the matter from the point of view of a\r\n    reform of the constitution for the public weal, and deciding it\r\n    by the vote of the majority, I placed the conduct of affairs in\r\n    the hands of the Imperial Court.\r\n\r\n    “In order to the fulfilment of this great work, my resignation\r\n    of the government was accepted by His Highness the Regent,\r\n    who had been appointed by the late Emperor as protector and\r\n    adviser of the young Ruler and by several of the Princes of the\r\n    blood and Nobles of the Court; at the same time I received the\r\n    Imperial command to carry on the government as before, until a\r\n    decision of the assembly of territorial Lords should be arrived\r\n    at. I waited for this assembly and was firmly resolved to take\r\n    part in it. In the most unexpected way, however, one morning\r\n    several Princes broke into the Palace with an armed force,\r\n    drove out His Highness the Regent, who had been appointed by\r\n    the Emperor, together with the Princes of the blood and the\r\n    Nobles of the Court, introducing in their stead certain Nobles\r\n    who had been banished by the dead Emperor, and abolished\r\n    the office of Shōgun, without waiting for the decision of\r\n    the proposed general meeting of the Council. My Hatamotos”\r\n    (petty nobles of the Tycoon’s court) “and vassal Princes were\r\n    profoundly indignant, and pressed upon me day and night the\r\n    absolute necessity of resisting by force of arms a crime which\r\n    broke the laws and set at nought the will of the people. But\r\n    inasmuch as my original intention in laying down the government\r\n    had been to assure the union of all classes of the people, such\r\n    exaggerated zeal was in contradiction to the determination\r\n    which I had adopted.\r\n\r\n    “Whatever my rights might be I would not be the cause of a\r\n    national revolution. It is with a view to avoiding such an\r\n    unhappy disturbance of the peace that I have come to Ōsaka.\r\n    My reasons for this procedure are not those which superficial\r\n    observers might presuppose. When I consider this criminal\r\n    proceeding from the point of view of love for my country and\r\n    its people, I cannot look with indifference upon the fact that\r\n    they have made themselves masters of the person of the young\r\n    Emperor, and under the pretext of the Imperial will, have given\r\n    the reins to their own egotistical desires, bringing suffering\r\n    upon the people. This is a complication which I am bound to\r\n    disentangle for the benefit of my people. Should there be any\r\n    people who disagree with me, I shall endeavour to persuade\r\n    them to bow to a majority of a general assembly and to pray\r\n    earnestly for a successful government of the country. Sharing\r\n    as I do the zeal of my ancestor, Iyéyasu, in his love for\r\n    the people, and striving with all my might to carry out the\r\n    intentions left behind him by the dead Emperor, I am inspired\r\n    by the earnest desire to unite my strength with that of the\r\n    whole nation, to carry out with all right and wisdom the task\r\n    which I have set myself, and to give effect to the views of the\r\n    assembly.\r\n\r\n    “There is no need for the Powers with which we have concluded\r\n    treaties of amity to trouble themselves about our internal\r\n    affairs. All that is of importance is that they should not\r\n    hinder the course of just principles. Insomuch as I have\r\n    loyally observed all the conditions of the treaties, I hope\r\n    all the more to deserve your approbation if I protect the\r\n    interests of all the Powers. You will, moreover, understand\r\n    that until the form of government shall have been settled by\r\n    a general discussion in an assembly of the people, it is my\r\n    duty to observe the treaties, and to carry out the agreements\r\n    which have been come to with Foreign Powers, and in general to\r\n    maintain relations with abroad.” (See Herr von Brandt’s “Drei\r\n    und dreissig Jahre in Ost Asien,” Vol. II., p. 170.)\r\n\r\nAfter this remarkable address, which seems to me to be of sufficient\r\ninterest to be given in full, the leave-taking was preceded by an\r\nanti-climax of the usual platitudes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Daimios were becoming more and more united, and\r\nwere pressing for the Tycoon’s reply to the proposal that he should\r\nsurrender to the Mikado property to the value of two million Kokus of\r\nrice, in order to form the nucleus of a national revenue. Tosa and other\r\nchieftains proposed that they should follow suit, but Satsuma, not yet\r\nquite educated up to the glories of self-sacrifice, was said to shy at\r\nthis idea, for which the time was not quite ripe; yet only a few more\r\nmonths were needed for its consummation.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were full of interest, though there was nothing more\r\nto be got out of the Uyésama, who by pertinacious questions about the\r\nBritish Constitution adroitly parried all attempts on the part of Sir\r\nHarry Parkes to draw him. In the meanwhile Satow and myself continued\r\nour surreptitious visits to the Satsuma Yashiki, where we met important\r\nmen who had been sent down from Kiōto to confer with us. We had but one\r\ndoctrine to preach: let the Mikado invite the Foreign Representatives to\r\naudience at Kiōto, and himself take over the direction of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe news from Yedo was as bad as could be. A Satsuma Princess, widow of\r\nthe last Tycoon but one, had been spirited away by the Satsuma clansmen\r\nin Yedo, upon which the Tycoon’s people retaliated by burning the three\r\nSatsuma Yashikis in that city. The clansmen took refuge in a steamer\r\nbelonging to their Prince and put to sea with the Tycoon’s ships in hot\r\npursuit. This resulted in an insignificant sea action.\r\n\r\nTwo of our student interpreters, Messrs. Quin and Hodges, had been fired\r\nupon as they passed in a native boat under the Satsuma battery; but no\r\ndamage was done. The Tycoon’s ship _Eagle_ was met by H.M.S. _Rodney_ off\r\nCape Ōshima on the 23rd—minus a foreyard arm; obviously the position was\r\nacute and fighting there must be.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of January we saw the sky lurid with fire in the direction of\r\nKiōto and heard that there had been fighting between the Tycoon’s troops\r\nand the Daimios at Fushimi. A servant in Willis’ employ came in from that\r\ndirection; he reported large numbers of clansmen camped round great fires\r\nin the streets. On the hither side of Fushimi were a regiment of the\r\nTycoon’s troops and bands of irregulars all eager for the fray.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the Satsuma Yashiki, where we used to visit our friends from\r\nKiōto, was burned down—either by its inmates or, as some said, fired by\r\nshells from the Tycoon’s troops. The Satsuma men escaped in boats, but\r\nwere fired upon from the banks and two men were killed. News came in\r\nthat Fushimi was in flames—burnt by the Daimios men who had disputed the\r\nentry into Kiōto of the Tycoon’s troops. More soldiers of the latter were\r\ngoing up. All sorts of rumours were flying about, among others a report\r\nthat the Daimios were tired of Satsuma and his arrogance. This did not\r\nstop the fighting, nor alas! the burning of small towns and villages, the\r\nflames of which we could see in the distance. It was heart-rending.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 29th we heard that the Tycoon’s troops were beaten.\r\nAt eleven o’clock of the 30th we received an intimation from the Tycoon\r\nthat he could no longer protect us. The Tycoon’s messenger promised to\r\nget us boats to take us down the river, and we set to work to pack up the\r\nLegation archives and what we could of our belongings.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the morning a letter came from M. Roches, telling us\r\nthat he had learned that the clansmen’s troops would enter the town soon\r\nafter daylight.\r\n\r\nIt would be of but moderate interest now to relate in detail our troubles\r\nof the next day or two, the difficulty of getting boats, the labour of\r\nmoving such chattels as we could, leaving the rest to be burnt or looted\r\nwith the Legation buildings. On the 2nd of February a first puff of smoke\r\nannounced the firing of the castle with all its glories of art. It was\r\ntime that we should leave Ōsaka. It had not been easy in those distracted\r\ntimes to procure fresh food, and our men were beginning to suffer from\r\nscurvy; a change to Hiōgo was to them a godsend.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January the Uyésama himself, who had been all this time in\r\nthe Castle of Ōsaka waiting the course of events, escaped in disguise in\r\nthe U.S. ship _Iroquois_, from which he transhipped into one of his own\r\nsteamers and made off to Yedo.\r\n\r\nThere has been much exaggeration as to the numbers of troops engaged at\r\nFushimi. There were probably not more than ten thousand of the Tycoon’s\r\nmen against some six thousand of the clansmen. And no doubt the former\r\nwould have given a better account of themselves had there not been\r\ntreachery in their camp. The General in command at a most important point\r\nturned traitor, and the enemy suddenly poured in upon them in a quarter\r\nwhere they believed themselves to be perfectly safe. Then the Tycoon’s\r\nCommander-in-Chief deserted to the enemy. The game was up.\r\n\r\nMy part in the flight from Ōsaka was very exciting. The rest of the\r\nLegation went down the river in boats, as I have said, and so by sea\r\nto Hiōgo. (Shall I ever forget the sight of our dear old giant Willis,\r\nsquatting like a man-mountain on the top of the great boxes containing\r\nthe archives—for he was Chancelier as well as Doctor?) I, on the other\r\nhand, was ordered to ride to Hiōgo in charge of the mounted escort.\r\nWe started in bitter weather with a blizzard in our teeth from the\r\nnorth-west; it pricked so hard that now and then the horses would try\r\nto turn round, and only with spur and whip could they be made to face\r\nit. The case was awkward, for having no more to go by than the points of\r\nthe compass, we missed our way, and had to travel for a good many miles\r\nthrough paddy fields of which the narrow banks were slippery with sleet\r\nand ice. At one place two of the men, whose horses absolutely refused to\r\ngo forward, were deposited in the horrible slush of the field and were,\r\nof course, drenched. Those who know rice fields need not be told of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn great misery our beasts skated along the banks making very slow\r\nprogress, and I was in despair of reaching Hiōgo before dark, when at\r\nlast, after several hours, I came upon the high road at a place where\r\nthe left bank of a broad river was occupied by some eight hundred or a\r\nthousand soldiers, waiting to be ferried across. I did not know to what\r\nclan, or even to what party, they belonged, and I confess that my heart\r\nwas in my mouth. However, as my men came up in single file, I passed\r\ndown the word to them to take no notice whatever might happen, but if\r\nthey should be in any way insulted or molested to come to me. I went up\r\nat once to the commander of the troops and addressed him with the utmost\r\nceremony, telling him who we were, and expressing the warmest friendship.\r\nTo my great relief he was quite polite and most amiable, making many\r\nexcuses for the delay which the ferrying over of his men would cause us;\r\nI, on the other hand, apologizing to him for disturbing his men. We were\r\nsoon on the best of terms, and as soon as his soldiers were all on the\r\nother side he sent back the ferry-boat for us. After crossing the river\r\nwe overtook him and his men again at Amagasaki; they were marching in a\r\ngreat open space near the castle. My friend the commander gave a word\r\nof command: “Halt! Front! Present arms!” My men carried their lances\r\nand so we rode through the town in great state, and without any further\r\nadventures good or bad reached Hiōgo a little after dark.\r\n\r\nIt had been a bitter ride, with rather more than a spice of emotion, and\r\nI doubt whether a more shivering lot of men and horses, starved with cold\r\nand hunger, faced the mangers that night in any part of the habitable\r\nglobe. Happily the two men who slipped into the rice-field were none the\r\nworse for their dirty ducking.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers were lodged in the old Custom House, Satow in an\r\noutbuilding, I in a shanty that might best be described as a Hiōgesque\r\nversion of a fifth-rate Margate lodging house. At any rate we had roofs\r\nover our heads, we had fresh food, and our good friend, Herr von Brandt,\r\nhad unearthed a bottle of Curaçoa, over which the diplomatic body made\r\nmerry. He had already triumphed over the hungry colleagues in Ōsaka by\r\nthe acquisition of a pig; but that led to difficulties, as the priests of\r\nthe temple in which he was lodged stoutly objected to the slaying of the\r\nunclean beast—not on account of its uncleanness, but on account of its\r\nbeing a beast and therefore under the protection of Buddhistic law. The\r\ndifficulties were overcome by a compromise whereby the place of execution\r\nwas fixed in a vegetable garden adjoining a remote corner of the temple\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nFebruary 3rd.—We had news from Kiōto to the effect that the Satsuma and\r\nDaimios party regretted our having left Ōsaka, where they stated that\r\nthey could have guaranteed our safety. However, the trick was done, and\r\nthere was plenty of work to keep us at Hiōgo. The clansmen told us that\r\nthe Tycoon had received orders to invite the Foreign Ministers to an\r\naudience of the Mikado at Kiōto. This invitation was never delivered,\r\nhaving been burked at the instigation of our good colleague, M. Léon\r\nRoches, whose great object it was, hoping against hope, to bolster up the\r\nTycoon, without whom all his schemes for monopolies would of necessity\r\nmiscarry; so he never ceased throwing obstacles in the way of the\r\nacknowledgment of the Mikado’s sovereign state.\r\n\r\nWith the restoration to power of the true Emperor the influence which he\r\nhad been at such pains to build up must tumble to pieces; it was a house\r\nbuilt upon foundations as unstable as the shifting sand. In his intrigues\r\nto keep back the invitation to Kiōto M. Roches’ action was both vain and\r\nfoolish. Vain, because it did not and could not retard the visit to Kiōto\r\nby one hour, and foolish, in that it was bound to break the eleventh\r\ncommandment.\r\n\r\nEstablished at Hiōgo we were under the impression that we might now in\r\npeace set about our business and go on with the first steps for the\r\nopening of two ports. Never were men more deluded. We had avoided the\r\nScylla of Ōsaka, where, as we now knew, we should have been perfectly\r\nsafe, and had steered into the Charybdis of Hiōgo, where we were within\r\na few hours to undergo an experience which, by the merest luck, did not\r\nend in a general massacre of the whole of the Foreign Representatives,\r\ntogether with numbers of Consuls and subjects of various nations, and\r\nwhich did end in a tragedy, gruesome and of haunting memory.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, about two in the afternoon, the Foreign Ministers\r\nwere busily employed upon the land at Kōbé, which had been assigned as\r\na foreign settlement, when a regiment of men of the Bizen clan, coming\r\nout of the gate of Hiōgo, halted at the word of command and opened a\r\nmurderous fire upon the foreigners. Happily they did not understand\r\nthe sights of their rifles, which, as it subsequently appeared, they\r\nhad recently received from America. They fired upon the principle laid\r\ndown, according to my old friend Lord Dorchester’s story, by one of his\r\nsergeants in the trenches before Sevastopol. A Russian head appeared\r\nabove the battlements of the town. “What’ll I give him?” asked a private\r\nof the Coldstream Guards. “Give the beggar a thousand yards and make\r\nsure of him!” Several volleys were fired. Sir Harry Parkes and Captain\r\nStanhope were in the thick of it. All the other Ministers and many people\r\nwere under fire. Mercifully only one American sailor lad of the _Oneida_\r\nwas slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the British escort and the other foreign guards could be got\r\ntogether they went in hot pursuit of the Bizen men, who were now in full\r\nflight, dropping their baggage as they went. The baggage consisting\r\nof various goods and chattels, including two small field-pieces and\r\na writing-desk belonging to one Ōmori Shinské, containing a burning\r\nlove-letter from a young lady of none too severe morals called Kotozawa\r\nSan! The pursuit yielded nothing; only one old woman of the Éta or Pariah\r\nclass was wounded. Being what she was, she would have fared badly had it\r\nnot been for the kindness of our good old Doctor Willis, who took her in\r\nand nursed her when no Japanese would come near her.\r\n\r\nNow for the so-called provocation which should justify such an outrage.\r\nThe evidence that we were able to take went to show that the men of\r\nBizen, notorious for their _Jō-i_ or anti-foreign feelings, on marching\r\nthrough Hiōgo had lost no opportunity of insulting any foreigners whom\r\nthey met. As they went along the road north of the foreign settlement\r\nthat was to be a Frenchman named Callier, one of M. Roches’ escort, came\r\nout of a wine-shop, and being rudely spoken to asked what was the matter.\r\nTo this the Japanese replied with threatening gestures. There was a\r\nhubbub, and a soldier took the cover off his lance and pricked Callier,\r\nwho dashed on one side and bolted into a house. At this moment the\r\nofficer in command, Taki Zenzaburō, dismounted and gave the order to fire\r\non the assembled foreigners.\r\n\r\nI am such an admirer of Mr. Longford’s “History of Japan” that it is with\r\nregret that I feel compelled to join issue with him upon his account of\r\nthis affair, the importance of which he unaccountably slurs over. For\r\nsome reason or other a few newspaper writers who were not present and\r\nwith whom Mr. Longford sides, were minded to belittle the significance\r\nof the attack. As a matter of fact it was about as gross a violation, not\r\nonly of constitutional custom, but of the laws of humanity, as could be\r\nconceived. Mr. Longford characterizes the incident in his own way, saying\r\nthat subsequent investigation “shows that it was not one over which\r\nEuropeans can now feel pride.”\r\n\r\nHe tells the story as follows: “A detachment of Samurai of the Bizen\r\nclan, escorting the Karō, the chief councillor of the Prince, passed Kōbé\r\non their way to Kiōto to join the loyal party. A French marine broke\r\nthe line of their procession, a gross insult in the eyes of a Japanese\r\nSamurai, and though an attempt was made to stop him, he persisted in\r\npassing through it. He received a lance prick for his pains, and he and\r\nhis comrades, one of whom was also slightly wounded, then ran away. The\r\nJapanese followed them with a desultory fire which did no harm. Panic\r\nseems to have seized the whole of the residents in the new Foreign\r\nSettlement in the direction of which the fire went. Large forces were\r\nimmediately landed from the great fleet of men-of-war of all Western\r\nnationalities.”\r\n\r\nThis statement of the case is wrong throughout. Mr. Longford goes on to\r\nimply that the punishment of the officer in command of the Bizen men\r\nwas unjustifiable. Mr. Longford’s account is, as I can aver, absolutely\r\nmisleading and contrary to the evidence. He was not at Kōbé at the\r\ntime.[5] I was. But lest my version of the story should be deemed\r\none-sided, let me call into court a witness whose testimony is beyond\r\nreproach. In his “Drei und Dreissig Jahre in Ost Asien” Herr von Brandt,\r\nwho was Prussian Minister in Japan at the time, puts a very different\r\ncomplexion upon the episode.\r\n\r\n“As we—that is to say, Count de la Tour, the Italian Minister, the\r\ncommanders of the U.S. warships _Iroquois_ and _Oneida_, and myself—left\r\nthe Custom House and stepped on to the open sandy space which surrounded\r\nit we saw there a great number of foreigners, who had probably been\r\nattracted by the sight of Japanese troops that were marching through.\r\nThere appeared to be several hundred men, who were marching towards\r\nŌsaka in regular order along the road which bounded the wide open space\r\non the north.\r\n\r\n“We were about three or four hundred paces away from the troops, though\r\nmany of the foreigners were far nearer. All of a sudden I saw the\r\nsoldiers halt, front, and immediately I heard the rattle of a volley of\r\nmusketry and the whistling of bullets mostly over our heads. At first I\r\nthought that it was a fight between the Mikado’s troops and the Tycoon’s\r\nmen, and was about to give expression to my indignation that such an\r\noccurrence should be possible in the foreign settlement when a second\r\nvolley, and the flight of the Europeans who were between us and the\r\nJapanese, told another tale. The Japanese troops had opened fire upon the\r\nwhole crowd of promenaders, among whom was Sir Harry Parkes.... I must\r\nconfess that I expected nothing else than that we should have to fight\r\nfor our lives, for I could not but think that the Japanese would follow\r\nus up.\r\n\r\n“I was not a little astonished when I saw that after they had fired six\r\nor seven volleys—they were armed with repeating rifles—they quietly\r\nmarched off.” (Here follows an account of the landing of bluejackets\r\nand marines and the fruitless pursuit of the Japanese soldiers.) “Only\r\none ship’s boy and another foreigner had been slightly wounded, a piece\r\nof luck which I attribute to the Japanese having fired too high; they\r\nmust have fired many times at the flags of the treaty Powers which were\r\nflying over the Custom House, at any rate the building was riddled with\r\nbullets.... In the meanwhile, we had had further information as to the\r\nBizen troops, and had been able to ascertain (_feststellen können_)\r\nthat during their whole march through Hiōgo and Kōbé they had behaved\r\nshamefully to all the foreigners whom they met, threatening many of them\r\nand wounding two with their spears.”\r\n\r\nThis is a very different version of the story; it is told by the\r\nresponsible minister of a great Power, a man of singular ability and\r\ncircumspection. This version I, who was on the spot, though not myself\r\nunder what was only saved from being a deadly fire by the ignorance\r\nof the use of the rifle’s sights, fully confirm—and it is indirectly\r\nendorsed by the action taken not only by the whole body of foreign\r\nministers but also by the Government of the Mikado. Against that\r\nyou have to set the mutterings of irresponsible hearsay, to which,\r\nunfortunately, Mr. Longford has lent the support of his authority as\r\nhistorian and ex-consul.\r\n\r\nTo sum up—the attack was made by a clan known to be specially hostile to\r\nall intercourse with the West; it was directed against all the treaty\r\nPowers, whose flags were flying on the building set apart for their\r\nuse and whose ministers were engaged peaceably with a great number of\r\ntheir fellow-subjects in laying out the future settlement under treaty\r\nrights, escaping death by a miracle. The outrage was deliberate, and\r\nabsolutely unprovoked, the story of the breaking of the procession being\r\nan afterthought. We heard nothing of it at the time, and that was the\r\nview which the Japanese themselves took of it, for the guilty officer was\r\ncondemned to _hara-kiri_, and the rest of the sad story is told in my\r\n“Tales of Old Japan.” I have only dwelt upon it because I wished to clear\r\nup a story which, as told in Mr. Longford’s book, would remain a blot\r\nupon the memory of men, who, after long and anxious debate, by a vote\r\nof the majority took upon themselves a grave responsibility, in which\r\nthey were fully justified by the incontrovertible evidence which, to my\r\nknowledge, they sifted with the most painstaking care. Mr. Longford fixes\r\nupon Sir Harry Parkes the responsibility of the death sentence. Wrong\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, when, on March the 2nd, two leading men, Godai and\r\nIto (Prince Ito) came to see whether the life of Taki Zenzaburō might not\r\npossibly be spared, at the Council of Ministers which followed Sir Harry\r\nParkes and M. de Graef van Polsbroek argued and actually voted in favour\r\nof the condemned man—but they were in a minority, and it was decided,\r\nwisely as I thought at the time, and still think, that the decree of\r\nthe Mikado must be carried out. The Japanese petition for clemency was\r\nvery half-hearted; and over and over again Japanese gentlemen of high\r\nposition, amongst them one of the ablest of the Mikado’s ministers, in\r\nconversation with me endorsed the action of the Representatives; they\r\ntook the same view that I did, saying that clemency would be mistaken\r\nfor cowardice. There had been too many attacks upon foreigners, many of\r\nwhich had been unavenged. Here was a man of some condition guilty of what\r\nwas the greatest outrage which the anti-foreign party had attempted.\r\nTo excuse him would be to invite a repetition of such offences. The\r\nknowledge that this officer had expiated his deed under sentence from his\r\nEmperor would penetrate all Japan, and would prove that the Son of Heaven\r\nwas not only in favour of foreign intercourse, but was prepared to punish\r\nany violation of the Treaties.\r\n\r\nThat night, March the 2nd, came the last act of the tragedy. I have\r\nrecounted it in my “Tales of Old Japan”; it need not be repeated here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo go back a step or two. On the 8th of February Higashi Kuzé, one of the\r\nnobles of the Court, who had been banished by the former Emperor, brought\r\nto the Representatives the following notification:\r\n\r\n    “The Emperor of Japan announces to the Sovereigns of all\r\n    foreign countries and to their subjects that permission has\r\n    been granted to the Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu in accordance\r\n    with his request to hand back the governing power. We shall\r\n    henceforward exercise the supreme authority in all the internal\r\n    and external affairs of the country. Consequently the title\r\n    of Emperor must be substituted for that of Tycoon under which\r\n    the Treaties have been made. Officers are being appointed by\r\n    us for the conduct of Foreign Affairs. It is desirable that\r\n    the Representatives of the Treaty Powers should recognize this\r\n    announcement.\r\n\r\n                                      “Feb. 3, 1868. Mutsuhito—L.S.”\r\n\r\nThe reading of this document, after it had been translated, led to the\r\npoor envoy being bombarded with questions, relevant and irrelevant. The\r\nBizen affair, the return of foreigners to Ōsaka and various other matters\r\nwere discussed, in the midst of which poor M. Roches lost his temper and\r\nhad rather a rough time of it with some of the colleagues. It was almost\r\nhis last outburst, for he was soon to leave for Europe when Baron Brin,\r\na charming man, would take his place as _chargé d’affaires_. Though he\r\nwas none too civil to me personally, as an Englishman and quite opposed\r\nto his policy, I always entertained a kind of sneaking regard for M.\r\nRoches. He was in private life a picturesque and rather fascinating\r\npersonality. But when, for his undoing, stripped of his white burnous and\r\nhis Spahi’s uniform, he was pitchforked into diplomacy he became a round\r\npeg in a square hole. None of his schemes and stratagems outlived the\r\nfœtus stage, and his fireworks were but damp squibs.\r\n\r\nHis discomfiture was pathetic; the utter failure of his policy,\r\naccentuated by the Imperial manifesto brought by Higashi Kuzé, had\r\ndestroyed the last particle of prestige that he had once had with the\r\ncolleagues, who now had no better course left to them than to follow the\r\nlead of Sir Harry Parkes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nJAPAN. MUKASHI\r\n\r\n\r\nIto was now appointed Governor of Hiōgo and Kōbé. It is curious that so\r\ncomparatively small an office should have been spoken of as an excessive\r\nrise for a man who was destined to become a Prince and great ruler, and\r\nwhose name was to become famous throughout the civilized world. He was a\r\nyoung man of about my own age, a yōnin or man of business of the Chōshiu\r\nclan, which some years before he had left to become a rōnin, when, with\r\nhis friend Inouyé, afterwards one of the “Elder Statesmen,” he undertook\r\na voyage to Europe, the two working their way before the mast. This\r\njourney did much to open his eyes and free his views; but, apart from\r\nthat, his energies and talents were bound to push him to the front. Great\r\nas were the services of the other clans—Satsuma especially—it was Chōshiu\r\nthat produced the two greatest men of the revolution—Kido and Ito.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March the Foreign Representatives returned to Ōsaka. On\r\nthe 7th there came a pressing request to Sir Harry from the Mikado’s\r\ngovernment to allow Dr. Willis to go to Kiōto to visit Yōdo, the Inkiyō\r\n(retired Prince) of Tosa, who was grievously ill. Sir Harry consented on\r\ncondition that I should accompany him, for he never lost any opportunity\r\nof getting behind the scenes in the great political drama which was\r\nbeing played. I should add that during the previous month Dr. Willis had\r\ngone to the capital to give advice and help in the case of the wounded\r\nsoldiers of the clans. On that occasion he was accompanied by Mr. Satow,\r\nwho brought back most valuable information as to the state of parties\r\nand was able to give the government, new to all diplomatic procedure,\r\nexcellent advice as to their dealings with foreigners—especially in the\r\nmatter of the Bizen attack. They must have been the first foreigners to\r\nset foot in the sacred city since the days of the Christian troubles\r\nnearly three hundred years ago, for the occasional passing of the Dutch\r\nmerchants of Deshima could hardly be taken into account.\r\n\r\nDr. Willis and I lost no time; we started at eight o’clock in the evening\r\nhaving, to use a Japanese expression, “broken our bones” in getting\r\nready; we could have started earlier had it not been for the delay caused\r\nby the very officer who, with such urgent instructions, had been sent to\r\ngive us all facilities, and who had done absolutely nothing! However,\r\nafter endless wanderings through Ōsaka in search of this trusty guide,\r\nwe were finally deposited with a brazier and a lacquer box full of rice\r\nand fish—enough for a dozen men—in a Teaboat, one of the small craft in\r\nwhich the good citizens take their pleasure merrily on the river during\r\nthe summer nights, and so we slept and feasted our way up the river to\r\nFushimi, eight miles from Kiōto.\r\n\r\nHere we found but little to see of the deadly battle of the end of\r\nJanuary. To be sure much of the town had been destroyed by fire, but\r\nin this land, where the houses are built of wood and paper and whole\r\ndistricts are burnt down by the peaceful upsetting of a brasero on a\r\nwindy day, the charred remains of a great conflagration excite little\r\nastonishment and still less suggest the horrors of war. The burning\r\nof the bridge at Yōdo was more significant. Yōdo was a stronghold of\r\nthe Tycoon which his general, dazzled as the clansmen said by the\r\nappearance of the Mikado’s standard, the golden sun on a scarlet ground,\r\ntreacherously gave up to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt Fushimi we were met by a perfect nightmare in the shape of a guard\r\nof Tosa men—wild-looking fellows, clad in armour with their faces\r\nhideously masked and long elf locks of black or white horsehair hanging\r\ndown from their helmets over their shoulders. With this weird escort of\r\npantomimic demons we marched into Kiōto along a road which was really one\r\nlong, continuous village full of shops doing a brisk trade in gods and\r\ndolls—fairings to be taken home by pious pilgrims to the shrines of the\r\nsacred city. The road was in a very bad state, having been much cut up\r\nby the passing of artillery.\r\n\r\n_Cosas d’España!_ When we reached our destination we found that we need\r\nhave been in no such violent hurry. Nothing had been prepared for our\r\nreception, and we were kept waiting for several hours in a very shabby\r\noutlying building, apparently a sort of guard-room for soldiers. At\r\nlast, when our patience was almost exhausted, we were conducted in\r\nall solemnity to the Prince’s residence, one of those long, rambling,\r\nbungalow-like buildings, or rather groups of buildings, surrounded by a\r\nwall, and containing quarters for a whole army of retainers and soldiers.\r\nVery white wood without a knot or flaw in it, vast roomy apartments\r\nwithout a decoration or ornament of any kind, except one picture hung by\r\nsilken strings in the Tokonoma, the raised dais at one end of the room,\r\ncomposed the magnificent simplicity of a great noble’s dwelling in the\r\ndays of the old Japan.\r\n\r\nFurniture there was none save a sword rack; the fair white mats served as\r\nbed, tables and chairs; such cupboards as were needful were let into the\r\nwall; paper sliding screens, open at the tops, divided the rooms; there\r\nwas no privacy, and if a confidential talk was needed the profane had to\r\nbe sent away out of ear-shot, which, luckily, implied no offence. The\r\npalace occupied by the Prince had been, until the revolution, occupied by\r\nthe Prince of Aidzu. It was spoil of war.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been shown to our apartments, which were the state guest\r\nsuite of the house, the ex-Prince sent to beg that, as he was too ill to\r\nwelcome us otherwise, we would go to see him. Such a ramble through an\r\ninterminable maze of passages all alike! Even our guides were sometimes\r\npuzzled, for they, of course, were hardly yet posted in the topography\r\nof this recent acquisition. At last we came to the outside of the great\r\nman’s rooms, where his retainers, all of them, no matter how high their\r\nrank might be, laid aside their dirks (_wakizashi_), for no man must\r\nenter his lord’s presence armed. The sword (_katana_) must always be\r\ntaken out of the girdle on entering a house.\r\n\r\nPrince Yōdo, the Inkiyō of Tosa, was a very remarkable man,—remarkable\r\neven among the many notable personalities of those stirring times. A\r\nDaimio when he resigned his position in favour of his heir and became\r\nInkiyō might divest himself of the pomp and circumstance of princely\r\nrank, but he rarely gave up the actual power. Such men as Shimadzu\r\nSaburō, of Satsuma, Daté of Uwajima, and Yōdo, all Inkiyō, remained the\r\nreal governing force in their several clans. The greatest of these was\r\nYōdo, whom we were presently to see. He was a far-seeing man of the\r\nhighest intelligence, and took a much more statesmanlike view of affairs\r\nthan the other Daimios.\r\n\r\nWhen these were pressing, as I have stated above, for the surrender by\r\nthe Tokugawa clan of property bringing in two million kokus of rice\r\nhe saw that such a confiscation would be futile and absurd as the\r\nnucleus of a national revenue. He it was who proposed that all the\r\nDaimios should surrender their almost regal estates, retaining only a\r\npercentage sufficient to maintain a suitable position; he foresaw that\r\nthe sacrifice would be rather apparent than real, and that, if the\r\nEmpire were consolidated, they would be more than compensated by being\r\nrelieved of the necessity of maintaining a whole machinery of government,\r\nwith military and, in some cases, naval forces. Satsuma and some other\r\nPrinces jibbed at this in the first instance; they had not Yōdo’s grasp\r\nof affairs, and were wedded to what he recognized as a worn-out feudal\r\nsystem. In the end they had to yield and Yōdo’s wisdom won the day.\r\n\r\nYōdo, like some of our own statesmen of a generation little more than\r\nfifty years before his time, had been a very free liver. In his youth he\r\nhad a seal engraved with the device, “The drunken Daimio of the Southern\r\nSeas.” His excesses had been notorious, and he was now paying his shot.\r\n\r\nWe found the old _viveur_—old not in years—lying on the mats in the midst\r\nof a pile of quilts and coverlets decked with beautiful purple crape,\r\na cloud of strong colour contrasting sharply with the waxen mask and\r\nhands of the sick man. At his head was his wife, an elderly lady with\r\nher eyebrows shaven and her teeth lacquered black,[6] ministering to his\r\nwants, and behind him sat his last and favourite young lady, a pretty\r\nlittle girl hardly more than a child, with her hands under a corner of\r\nthe quilt, for the poor little soul was very cold. She had her teeth and\r\neyebrows left as nature had given them to her, with no disfigurement\r\ninflicted by the tyranny of fashion. She seemed at first to be very shy\r\nand abashed at the presence of the inauspicious and monstrous foreigners.\r\nThe ex-Prince had the most exquisite manners, all the courtesy which to a\r\nJapanese gentleman of high rank is second nature.\r\n\r\nHe was, moreover, obviously gifted with that magnetic attraction which\r\nis so rare even amongst the greatest men and which fully accounted for\r\nhis influence among his peers. He received us warmly and expressed great\r\nthanks to us for arriving so quickly. I did not prolong my visit, for he\r\nappeared to be very tired and sick—as it seemed to my non-professional\r\neye, sick unto death. Dr. Willis, moreover, was eager to begin his\r\nexamination. So I took my leave, wondering that a man of only forty-seven\r\nshould look so old. He seemed to have used up his life. Dr. Willis, I may\r\nadd here, soon patched him up, and he lived for several years, rendering\r\ngood service to the State, though holding no office; but he could not\r\nshake off his old habits, and in the end they triumphed and killed him.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I breakfasted with Gotō Shōjirō and Katsura, who\r\nwere now important officials in the Foreign Office under the Mikado’s\r\nGovernment, at the house of the former, who it will be remembered\r\nbelonged to the Tosa clan and was Prince Yōdo’s chief adviser. In the\r\nmidst of our talk there arrived a dispatch which caused them great\r\napprehension, though as yet they had no details. When the full news\r\narrived it was bad enough. The story has been told before, but it needs\r\nto be repeated here, however briefly. The most complete account is that\r\nby Herr von Brandt, from which I have borrowed freely, refreshing my own\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March the two French ships _Vénus_ and _Dupleix_ were in\r\nthe bay of Ōsaka, where they had been engaged in taking soundings, and\r\nwith a view of continuing this work, Captain du Petit Thouars had sent\r\nhis steam launch with a gig to Sakai, a small port provisionally open to\r\nforeign trade, where such authorities as there were had been informed of\r\nthe operations on which these boats were engaged.\r\n\r\nAt about five o’clock in the afternoon, two of the launch’s crew asked\r\nleave to go on shore, the people up to that time having shown every\r\nsign of friendship, and other Europeans having previously landed there.\r\nHardly had they gone a few steps from the launch when they were joined\r\nby a Samurai who made signs to them to go to the other side of the quay.\r\nHere they were surrounded by about twenty armed men, who seized them\r\nand tried to bind them. One of the two men tore himself away, and the\r\nother jumped into the water, when the soldiery fired into the launch\r\nuntil they believed that all the crew were dead. As soon as the officer\r\nin the gig, whose men were unarmed—and indeed, those in the launch\r\nhad only revolvers, which had been stowed away in lockers for fear of\r\naccidents—heard the firing, he hurried to the rescue of the launch and\r\nwas met with a hot fire of musketry. One of his men was wounded, and as\r\nhe thought that all in the launch were killed, he steered for his ship\r\nand made his report. The massacre had been terrible; those who were not\r\nshot were beaten to death with poles armed with iron hooks.\r\n\r\nCaptain du Petit Thouars manned his boats and at once went off to Sakai;\r\non the way he met the launch. Out of a crew of one midshipman and fifteen\r\nmen, only two were dead; six were severely wounded, one unwounded,\r\nand seven missing, including the midshipman. Their bodies, cruelly\r\nmutilated, were afterwards given up. The machinery was riddled with\r\nbullets, but the sound man with the help of one or two of the less badly\r\nwounded men managed to rig up a sail and so escaped. The batteries on\r\nshore were manned and the foreign representatives were all in Ōsaka, and\r\nopen to attack. The captain of the _Vénus_ and the French Consul were,\r\nmoreover, supposed to be on their way from Ōsaka to Sakai, so Captain du\r\nPetit Thouars wisely refrained from taking any immediate action, which\r\nmight have led to terrible reprisals.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Ōsaka in the dead of the night, the representatives\r\nwere roused from their beds and a conference was at once held. They\r\ndetermined to make common cause with their French colleague, to strike\r\ntheir flags, and leave Ōsaka, until the demands of M. Roches, who had not\r\nyet left, should be satisfied. Those demands were:\r\n\r\n    1. The execution of the two officers in command at Sakai and\r\n    all those who had taken part in the crime.\r\n\r\n    2. An indemnity of 150,000 dollars for the families of the\r\n    victims.\r\n\r\n    3. That the Prime Minister should pay a visit to the _Vénus_ to\r\n    express regret and apologize on behalf of the Government.\r\n\r\n    4. That the Prince of Tosa, to whose clan the murderers\r\n    belonged, should do the same.\r\n\r\n    5. That men of the Tosa clan should be excluded from the\r\n    foreign ports.\r\n\r\nBad news for Willis and me; it was the very clan in whose hands we were.\r\nWe felt that we were in a hornets’ nest. Our hosts, who should at least\r\nhave remembered that we were there to save the life of their Prince whom\r\nthey loved, were maddened by the news, frantic at the idea that clansmen,\r\nperhaps near relations of some of them, were to be executed for a crime\r\nin which they themselves would gladly have had a hand.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to the _yashiki_ I was met by scowling looks and fierce\r\nmutterings. The more important men of the clan showed clearly that they,\r\nat any rate, had no sympathy with the murderers. Prince Yōdo himself and\r\nGotō Shōjirō we knew would act loyally and do all in their power to\r\ninsure our safety. But it is a near thing, and an uncomfortable pass to\r\ncome to, when you can almost hear two or three hundred wild men debating\r\nthe propriety of wreaking vengeance upon you, and that moreover in a\r\ncountry where at that time _kataki-uchi_, the vendetta, was a debt of\r\nhonour. However, there was nothing to be done but to put a good face upon\r\nit, so our dear old medicine-man went on with his healing, and I took\r\nadvantage of being in a city so famous and still so new to us Westerns to\r\nexplore its many beauties, now long since unveiled and familiar to every\r\ntourist.\r\n\r\nAt Gion, a quarter of the city where the Japanese dandies go to divert\r\nthemselves, I was bidden by two or three gentlemen to an entertainment\r\nin a famous tea-house. In these sophisticated days I doubt whether such\r\na feast could be given. There was a company of the most fashionable\r\n_geikos_—who in other parts, and indeed everywhere now, are called\r\n_geisha_. In song and in story the _geiko_ of old Kiōto is celebrated as\r\nan artist and for the willow-like beauty of her thighs—in this there is\r\nno impropriety, for there are no femoral revelations, and the expression\r\nsimply means gracefulness. In singing and in dancing they excel all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWhen these young ladies sat down between the guests I saw plainly that\r\nI was an object of terror—none wished to come near me—the strange beast\r\nfrightened them; but at last the prettiest of them took to herself heart\r\nof brass and squatted down beside me; shy and wild she was at first, but\r\nafter a while she became quite tame, like a little gazelle that feeds out\r\nof your hand, and indeed her eyes had much the look of those of a pet\r\ndeer; if only her pretty lips had not been gilt!\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the feast the landlady, black-toothed and shaven-browed,\r\ncame in armed with a murderous-looking chopper in one hand, and in the\r\nother a small stand upon which was placed a bean-curd cake, the dish for\r\nwhich the house was famous. The cutting up of the bean-curd cake was a\r\nscience and a ceremony, always taking place in the presence of guests.\r\nWith a great assumption of dignity the old lady lifted her chopper,\r\nand bringing it down with a great crack upon the wooden stand, from\r\nthe rebound of the blow gave a dozen or so little raps that sounded\r\nalmost like the roll of a drum, with which, as quick as thought, she\r\nhad sliced the bean-curd cake into as many little parts of almost\r\nmathematically equal size, which were carried off to be roasted on\r\nslender bamboo skewers. It was really a very pretty trick and received\r\nwith a loud tribute of applause, which the dear lady accepted with all\r\nthe consciousness of merit of a prima donna after the execution of a\r\nbrilliant _cavatina_.\r\n\r\nAs in duty bound, I ate my skewerful of bean-curds, but I confess that\r\nI did not relish them. Then came dancing—all of it full of intention to\r\nthe elect—to me the mere poetry of motion into which I, the barbarian,\r\ncould not read the significance and the story. The palm was borne away\r\nby two pretty little mites of about eleven years, precocious pets into\r\nwhom the Terpsichore of the Far East had breathed all her spirit, all\r\nher grace. When the dancing was over, the _geikos_ went away to doff\r\ntheir stage dresses, and appeared again as little _bourgeoises_, and the\r\ntwo tiny creatures became very inquisitive about me, and insisted upon\r\ntaking off my socks (the shoes had been left _more Japonico_ at the door)\r\nand examining my feet. Had they been Europeans I should have thought\r\nthat they were seeking for the cloven hoof. It was near midnight when I\r\nreached the Tosa Yashiki after seven hours of real good fun. I went back\r\nto an anxious night.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting part of the day had been a visit to the great\r\ntemple of Kiyomidzu, a lovely shrine hidden away in a sanctuary as\r\nbeautiful as the graces of hill, and trees and water could make it.\r\nHow cleverly the monks in all countries chose the places of their holy\r\nretreat from the world! But what filled me with wonder—a wonder hardly\r\nto be understood now—was the fact that I was gazing upon a panoramic\r\nview of the sacred city, to be found in which three short months before\r\nwould have meant the shortest of shrifts. There above all was the Kinri\r\n(literally “forbidden place”), the august but severely simple dwelling of\r\nthe Son of Heaven, itself a mystery, of which the nine gates were each\r\nguarded by a great Daimio.\r\n\r\nTo-day all these nebulous secrets have become the common property of the\r\nguide-books and the traveller, who without a care looks down from the\r\nbeautiful hills upon what now, shorn of its glamour, is but a dull, grey\r\ncity—if the truth must be told, rather shabby; for the grand shrines\r\nwhich are the glory of its sanctity are hidden away, screened from the\r\nprofane eyes in those lovely groves which were the first temples of the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nThe following morning brought me a letter from Sir Harry Parkes, giving\r\nme the details of the Sakai tragedy, in consequence of which the\r\nministers had left Ōsaka, and ordering me to return at once, inasmuch\r\nas if the French demands were not complied with hostilities would break\r\nout immediately. The Japanese officials also came to me with an account\r\ntallying in all particulars with my Minister’s letter; but they added\r\nthat as every reparation was to be made and M. Roches’ demands were to\r\nbe complied with, there need be no alarm of war. As for my position, the\r\nconsternation in the Tosa Yashiki may be imagined. Prince Yōdo sent me a\r\nmessage begging me to stay until the next day, and as I thought that I\r\nmight effect some good by doing so, that my leaving might be attributed\r\nto fear, and that to remain certainly would tell well amongst the members\r\nof the new Government, I determined to disobey my orders and comply with\r\nthe Prince’s request. The Japanese Government greatly appreciated the\r\nconfidence to which I thus gave expression.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of that day was passed in conference with high\r\nofficials, and it was not until late in the afternoon that I was able\r\nto sally forth into a driving storm of rain for more sightseeing. I was\r\nrewarded by seeing one _grande dame_ with her eyebrows shaven off and\r\nartificial ones painted in high up on the forehead, as one sees the\r\nfashions of the Mikado’s Court represented in old pictures. It was my\r\none and only experience of the mode so far as ladies were concerned. In\r\nthe case of the Mikado I was to see it afterwards on a more memorable\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nI was roused the next morning by a message from Prince Yōdo begging me to\r\ngo and see him. I found him evidently already much the better for Willis’\r\nministrations, in spite of the terrible shock of the Sakai massacre. I\r\nremained with him for two hours, discussing politics and especially the\r\naffair about which he spoke with deep feeling and unfeigned emotion.\r\nHad the murdered Frenchmen been his own countrymen he could not have\r\nshown greater sympathy, nor could any man have expressed it with greater\r\ndignity. I am bound to say that he inspired me with the utmost admiration.\r\n\r\nHe declared that the act of the murderers was one which he, in common\r\nwith every true Samurai—every man animated by the true _Yamato Damashii_,\r\nthe spirit of Old Japan, must look upon with detestation and horror.\r\nHe said that this deed, far from representing the feeling of the\r\nSamurai, was a disgrace to Japan, and the ruffians who perpetrated it\r\nshould be rooted out from the country. He then begged me to be the\r\nbearer of the following message to the French Minister and to the other\r\nrepresentatives. I took it down from his own lips, and repeat it here as\r\na noble and patriotic utterance.\r\n\r\n    “Although I am without precise information, I am aware that the\r\n    affair of Sakai was criminal and unjustifiable. It is a matter\r\n    of which I certainly had not the slightest cognizance. My one\r\n    wish has been to entertain friendly relations with foreigners.\r\n    The act of violence which my retainers have committed has\r\n    caused me to be deeply ashamed. I am aware that foreign nations\r\n    must feel grievously incensed. It hurts me to think that my\r\n    people should have interfered with the Mikado in his projects\r\n    for civilizing the country. I pray that Tosa alone, and not\r\n    the whole of Japan, may be rendered responsible for this\r\n    deed. I have been prevented by illness from going to Ōsaka to\r\n    punish the offenders myself, but I have sent two of my _karō_\r\n    (principal advisers, literally “elders of the family”) with\r\n    three officers of rank to represent me, taking with them one\r\n    hundred and sixty men, with orders to deliver up to justice\r\n    the guilty men. I beg you to communicate the expression of my\r\n    sentiments to the French Minister in particular, and to the\r\n    foreign representatives in general. Although this is a matter\r\n    for the Government of the country to deal with, I am anxious\r\n    that the thoughts of my heart should be made known to the\r\n    French Minister and to the foreign representatives.”\r\n\r\nEvery word that Prince Yōdo spoke was uttered with the most convincing\r\nair of truth. I took my leave of him with great regret. My talk with\r\nhim on general subjects and the political situation had been most\r\ninteresting. He left upon me the impression that he was possessed of wide\r\nviews and great sagacity; he was a man who had notoriously done much for\r\nhis country and who, but for the poison instilled by that education in\r\nself-indulgence which played such mischief with men of his caste, would\r\nhave been capable of very great things.\r\n\r\nI returned to Ōsaka that evening and lost no time in delivering Prince\r\nYōdo’s message at Hiōgo to M. Roches, who was greatly pleased with it. My\r\npresence in Kiōto during this affair, though it could not be otherwise\r\nthan a somewhat anxious adventure, was therefore of advantage as having\r\ngiven the Prince the opportunity of making his own position clear. Sir\r\nHarry Parkes fully approved of my having disobeyed his instructions.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of March Prince Daté (Inkiyō of Uwajima) arrived at Hiōgo and\r\nwent on board the French ship _Vénus_ to carry the official acceptance of\r\nthe conditions laid down by M. Roches.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of March was fixed for the execution by _Hara-kiri_ of the\r\ntwenty men guilty of the murders. It was originally fixed to take place\r\non the quay at Sakai, where the crime was committed, but the place was\r\nchanged to a temple about a mile inland. Captain du Petit Thouars and a\r\ncompany of some twenty Frenchmen were to witness the horror.\r\n\r\nWhen the first condemned man came out he plunged the dirk into his\r\nstomach with such force that his entrails protruded; he held them up\r\nin his hand and began singing verses of hatred and revenge against the\r\ndetested foreigners who were polluting the sacred soil of the Land of\r\nthe Gods till death stopped his ghastly song. Those who came after him\r\nfollowed his example, and the whole spectacle was so gruesome that when\r\neleven men had died—this being the number of the murdered victims—the\r\nFrenchmen could hold out no longer, and Captain du Petit Thouars prayed\r\nthat the remaining nine men might be spared. His account of the scene\r\nto me was blood-curdling. Brave man as he was—one of the bravest—it\r\nnearly made him sick only to think of it, and his voice faltered as with\r\ndifficulty he told the tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nJAPAN. THE MIKADO\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Yamashina no Miya, first cousin once removed of the Mikado,\r\nwho had arrived at Hiōgo the previous day to invite the Foreign Ministers\r\nto an audience of the Emperor at Kiōto, called upon Sir Harry. The Prince\r\nwas robed in the old court dress of a purple colour with the curious cap\r\n(_yéboshi_) of wrinkled black paper. His teeth were blackened, but as\r\nthat process has to be renewed every two, or at most three, days, and as\r\nthey were at that moment in a transition stage, they did not look their\r\nbest. When we saw him again a few days later they had been newly polished\r\nup, and shone like patent leather.\r\n\r\nWe reached Kiōto on the 21st and were lodged in the magnificent temple\r\ncalled Chi-on-in, lying in a grove at the foot of the beautiful\r\nHigashiyama, “the eastern hill.” Everything had been done to insure our\r\ncomfort, and the temple was guarded by troops of the Awa, Higo and Owari\r\nclans. Our rooms were really of royal magnificence, and we were treated\r\nto a feast of innumerable dainties set out with an elaborate etiquette\r\nthat would have satisfied the great Yoshimasa,[7] the Lucullus of Japan,\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to forget the lovely temple with its avenues of\r\nhuge cherry trees, its vast halls, its art treasures, and its great\r\nsolemn bell rolling out deep, musical waves of sound far away over the\r\ncity; but I saw it again in 1906, quite unchanged, quite untouched by\r\npolitical upheavals, and had the chance to talk over the story of forty\r\nyears gone by with the stately and venerable abbot, who remembered the\r\ncruel days when the great State apartments were turned for the nonce into\r\nhospital wards.\r\n\r\nThe day of the 22nd was spent in paying official visits, the chief\r\ninterest of which lay in the fact that we were entering into relations\r\nwith men who had never set eyes upon foreigners before, nobles who, like\r\ntheir fathers for many centuries before them, had lived in a cloistered\r\nseclusion hardly less strict than that of the Emperor himself, and upon\r\nwhom the light of the last weeks, even of the last days, had burst like\r\na flash of electricity in a cave of Stygian darkness. One great man told\r\nus quite frankly that he, like the rest of the Court, had been bitterly\r\nopposed to any intercourse with foreigners—now all was changed, and he\r\nwas glad of it. He afterwards apologized, saying that he was afraid that\r\nhe had spoken too freely, and that, at any rate, he felt grateful to the\r\nEnglish for having been the first to recognize the true position of the\r\nMikado.\r\n\r\nA little later in the day Prince Daté and Gotō Shōjirō came to discuss\r\nthe ceremonial for the audience on the morrow. They seemed very anxious\r\nas to how the boy-Emperor would play his part. It was all so new to him.\r\nIt must be remembered that only a very few of the highest nobles were\r\nprivileged to see their Sovereign face to face. Even the Shōgun did not\r\nsee him, but only knelt in front of the red lattice-curtain behind which\r\nhe heard the Son of Heaven issuing his commands. For the last ten days\r\nthe rigid etiquette had been so far broken that certain Daimios had been\r\nallowed to see him. I could not help sympathizing with the poor young\r\nMikado in this prospective ordeal.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that he should learn his speech by heart and try to\r\nrepeat it, the copy being then handed to Yamashina no Miya, who would\r\nread it out and hand it in turn to Ito to be translated, the document\r\nitself ultimately remaining with Sir Harry, who would reply directly to\r\nthe Mikado. As for me, I was to be presented by Yamashina no Miya to his\r\nMajesty, who would greet me with the formula “Kuro” (“I am glad to see\r\nyou”).\r\n\r\nThe reception of M. Roches on the 22nd was the last of his Japanese\r\nexperiences. As will have been gathered, I was no great admirer of his\r\npolicy or of his proceedings, but I am bound to say that his final act\r\nwas marked by all the courtesy of his chivalrous nation. The fifth of\r\nthe demands made by him in regard to the Sakai massacre was that all\r\nTosa Samurai should be excluded from the foreign settlements. In answer\r\nto Prince Yōdo, who desired to be informed how long this was to hold\r\ngood, M. Roches very graciously replied that he would leave that to the\r\nPrince, who was far more capable than himself of being the judge in such\r\na matter. It was the answer of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe audience of the English Minister was fixed for the 23rd, and at one\r\no’clock we left the temple in pomp and state which it is needful that\r\nI should describe in order that what followed may be understood. First\r\ncame the Legation mounted escort, headed by their inspector, Mr. Peacock.\r\nThese were picked men sent out from the Metropolitan Police, a gallant\r\nlittle troop armed with lances, making a brave show. Then came Sir Harry\r\nParkes on horseback, with Satow and two high officials, Gotō Shōjirō and\r\nNakai Kōzō; after them a guard of the 9th Regiment under Lieutenants\r\nBradshaw and Bruce (afterwards Marquess of Ailesbury). My mare had\r\nunfortunately gone dead lame, so I followed in a palanquin. After me\r\ncame a guard of some fifteen hundred or two thousand Japanese soldiers.\r\nAs good luck would have it, Dr. Willis and some naval officers whom Sir\r\nHarry had invited, among whom were two surgeons, accompanied us.\r\n\r\nWithout let or hindrance our procession passed along a straight street\r\nalmost facing the gates of the temple, but as the leading men turned\r\nthe corner of the Shimbashi Street—a street where there are not a few\r\nwine-shops and houses inhabited by geishas (quite respectable), two\r\nRōnin armed with naked swords sprang out and began slashing and hacking\r\nin the maddest fury. The street was so narrow that our men’s lances\r\nwere hindered by the projecting eaves of the houses, and were useless.\r\nNakai Kōzō jumped off his horse and drawing his sword engaged one of\r\nthem, but catching his foot in his long trousers, stumbled and received\r\na severe cut on the head from a blow the full and deadly force of which\r\nhe contrived to parry. At this moment Gotō Shōjirō, who, with Sir Harry,\r\nhad not yet turned the corner, perceiving from the backing of the horses\r\nand the scuffle in front that there was mischief ahead, dismounted and,\r\ndashing forward, rushed to the rescue of Nakai. Between them, fighting\r\nlike fury, they killed the ruffian, and Nakai, jumping up, hacked off his\r\nhead. The other man rushed at Sir Harry, cutting and slashing as he went,\r\nbut fortunately missing the Minister. Satow had a narrow escape, for his\r\nhorse was wounded close to his rider’s knee, and part of the poor beast’s\r\nnose was sliced off.\r\n\r\nOn the villain went, now cutting at the men of the 9th. I heard pistol\r\nshots and the clatter of swords and cries of, “We are attacked!” “Kill\r\nhim!” “Shoot him!” and the like. I jumped out of my palanquin more\r\nquickly than I ever in my life jumped out of anything, and rushed\r\nforward. There were pools of blood in the street, and I saw the murderer\r\ncoming at me, by this time himself wounded, but not seriously, and full\r\nof fight. His sword was dripping and his face bleeding. I knew enough of\r\nJapanese swordsmanship to be aware that it was no use to try and avoid\r\nhis blow, so I rushed in underneath his guard and wrenched the bleeding\r\nsword out of his grip. I handed him over to the men of the 9th, but\r\nhe managed to wriggle away from them and bolted down a passage into a\r\ncourtyard. I ran on to see whether Parkes was safe. To my great relief\r\nhe was sitting on his horse, quite unmoved, with Satow, whose pony was\r\nbleeding, also mercifully unhurt. As I came up with them I stumbled over\r\nsomething; it was a man’s head. The street was like a shambles; nine of\r\nthe escort and one man of the 9th and four horses had been wounded, some\r\nof them lying in pools of their own blood. Sir Harry’s groom was also\r\nbleeding. Our gallant little friend Nakai was badly hurt, but quite gay,\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the affray was over and that there was nothing that I could\r\ndo, I ran back to make sure of the other Rōnin who had run down the\r\ncourtyard. I found that he had been shot in the face by Lieutenant\r\nBradshaw, but the weapon was but a toy pistol and the bullet had glanced\r\noff the jaw-bone. When I reached the bottom of the yard, I saw my man,\r\na repulsive object smeared with mud and blood so that his features were\r\nhardly human, trying to escape over a wall. I hung on to him and pulled\r\nhim down. I shall never forget the horror in his eyes as he glared\r\nat me, evidently thinking that I should kill him. Of course he looked\r\nupon me as a man might look upon his murderer. But my object, on the\r\ncontrary, was to save him. I wanted him, for through him I hoped to get\r\nat the bottom of the plot. So I handed him over to the guard with strict\r\ninjunctions that he was not to be hurt.\r\n\r\nAs for the fifteen hundred Japanese soldiers, they decamped, and only\r\ncame back having in the distance fired what was something uncommonly like\r\na _feu de joie_. It was perhaps too much to expect of them, new as they\r\nwere to relations with foreigners, that they should show the same courage\r\nand loyalty which had been exhibited by Gotō and Nakai.\r\n\r\nOf course, going on to the Court was out of the question for that day.\r\nSome time was lost in getting coolies to carry our poor fellows, at\r\nleast as many of them as were fainting from loss of blood. The others,\r\nbadly wounded though they were, insisted on sticking to their horses.\r\nThey behaved splendidly and in all that pain and trouble there was not a\r\nsingle complaint to be heard.\r\n\r\nMy especial care was for my prisoner; his evidence was too important for\r\nme to leave him to chance. Such coolies as we could muster were wanted\r\nfor our men, so in despair I pressed two honest citizens, shopkeepers,\r\ninto my service, and with dire threats made them carry him in my\r\n_norimono_ (palanquin), for he was far too weak and exhausted to be able\r\nto walk. The two shopkeepers were intensely disgusted, and their protests\r\nthat they were respectable burghers and ought not to be made to do the\r\nwork of _etas_ (pariahs) were almost comic; but our blood was up and they\r\nhad to do it.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy procession home. As I walked by the side of Sir\r\nHarry’s horse he turned to me and said, “Sensation diplomacy this,\r\nMitford.” It certainly was. When we reached home our beautiful temple\r\nwas turned into a hospital. Our wounded men, bleeding as if their life\r\nmust ebb out, lay patiently in the verandah, waiting their turn for the\r\nassistance of the surgeons, who, stripped to their shirts, seemed almost\r\nto multiply themselves, so swift and skilful were they. Shirts and sheets\r\nwere being torn up into bandages, buckets of bloody water were being\r\nemptied and filled again. Everything one touched was sickening, wet, and\r\nred. It was a nightmare. Presently the head of the man whom Nakai had\r\nkilled was brought in—a terrible sight. One awful triangular wound had\r\nlaid bare part of the brain, and there was a gash from a sword on the\r\nright jaw.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the prisoner’s wounds were dressed, Satow and I with a\r\nretainer of Sanjo Dainagon examined the prisoner. He was a beetle-browed,\r\ntruculent-looking fellow with rolling black eyes, and his appearance was\r\nnot improved by bloodstained rags, and a large head with a shock crop of\r\nwiry hair which, having abandoned the priesthood, he had just begun to\r\nlet grow. He said:\r\n\r\n“My name is Ishikawa Samurō. I am a priest from a temple called Jōrenji,\r\nnear Ōsaka. I left the Castle this morning determined to kill all the\r\nforeigners that I might meet. I came to Kiōto on the second day of this\r\nmonth to join the Mikado’s bodyguard, and I lodged at the temple called\r\nHommanji in the Temple Street. I left it the day before yesterday and\r\nwent to the Castle. I was in the first regiment at the Castle, but could\r\nnot agree with my mates, so determined to regulate my conduct according\r\nto my own ideas. I set out to kill foreigners; I had no accomplice. I\r\npray to be examined, and, if found guilty, to be executed and my crime\r\nmade known throughout the Empire.”\r\n\r\nAt a second questioning, he said: “I had an accomplice, one Hayashida,\r\nI forget his other name.[8] He is the son of a village doctor, not\r\nbelonging to the Samurai class, from Katsura Mura, a village near Kiōto.\r\nHe is a Rōnin. He belonged to the first regiment of Guards. I heard last\r\nnight from the servants that foreigners were going to Court. I waited\r\nto see them pass. I did not know to what nation they belonged. It was\r\nthe first time that I had seen foreigners. I repent of my crime. It was\r\na sudden thought on the part of both of us. I had no previous hatred to\r\nforeigners.”\r\n\r\nOn being shown the head of the man who had been decapitated in the\r\nstreet, of whose death up to this time he was unaware, he added:\r\n\r\n“This is the head of Hayashida. Since he is dead I wish to live no\r\nlonger. Please cut off my head as soon as possible. We had been drinking\r\ntogether at a wine-shop. I forget the name of the shop.”\r\n\r\nTo this second statement the wounded man adhered through a strict\r\ncross-examination, and he solemnly stated that there was no other person\r\nin league with him.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough this outrage excited the greatest consternation at\r\nthe Court of the Mikado, and in the evening his Majesty sent Tokudaiji\r\nDainagon, and several of his highest officers of State, dressed in their\r\ncourt robes, to present his condolences and the expression of his deep\r\nregret at what had occurred. They inquired with great sympathy as to the\r\nstate of the wounded men.\r\n\r\nThis, taken in conjunction with the gallant behaviour of Gotō and Nakai,\r\nand with the prompt punishment meted out for recent attacks, could leave\r\nno doubt as to the sincerity of the horror which was expressed. Nearly\r\nforty years later—in 1906—when I was sent with Prince Arthur on the\r\nGarter Mission, it fell to my lot to take the Grand Cross of the Royal\r\nVictorian Order to the Marquis Tokudaiji, Lord Great Chamberlain as he\r\nthen was, and he reminded me of the ghastly circumstances of our first\r\nmeeting on that memorable evening in Kiōto.\r\n\r\nOur people, savage at the treatment which their comrades had received,\r\nwere none too keen to minister to the wants of the prisoner. I could not\r\nbut feel some compassion for the poor wretch, and so I took him tea and\r\nrice and soup, and filled his pipe with tobacco; after a while he became\r\nquite tame and confidential. It is a curious sensation that of talking\r\nwith one’s would-be murderer. The poor fellow was very grateful and said\r\nover and over again that if he had known what kind folk the foreigners\r\nwere, he never would have embarked upon an enterprise which he now deeply\r\nregretted. He said that he felt ashamed when he thought of the care and\r\nattention which he was receiving. Now, since Hayashida was dead, his only\r\nwish was to die too. He had heard of the fame of Satow as a scholar, but\r\ndid not know to what nation he belonged. As for me, I was beginning to\r\nfeel towards him as one might towards a dangerous wild beast beginning to\r\nshow signs of willingness to feed out of one’s hand.\r\n\r\nThis morning (the 24th) he had to undergo another examination by a\r\nJapanese official, who furnished us with an example of the criminal\r\nprocedure of Japan in those days. This gentleman was an inspector of the\r\nbodyguard, who, by representing himself as belonging to the Jō-i, or\r\nanti-foreign party, and applauding the prisoner’s deed, gradually wormed\r\nhimself into his confidence, and got a good deal of fresh information out\r\nof him, especially a statement that there were three other accomplices,\r\nalso belonging to the first regiment of Guards, who had been waiting\r\nin a house further down the street ready to spring out and follow up\r\nthe action of himself and Hayashida should they fail, or only partially\r\nsucceed, in their attempt. The prisoner stated that he was twenty-nine\r\nyears of age—Hayashida, the dead man, was a lad of eighteen. He repeated\r\nhis thanks for the kindness which he had received at my hands and at\r\nthose of Doctor Willis. Once more he begged to be executed quickly.\r\nHayashida was dead and he had no care to live. The three men whom he\r\ndenounced were of course arrested, and equally of course, denied their\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we had a second visit from the ministers of the Mikado.\r\nThey brought with them a despatch conveying in writing the apologies\r\nwhich they had delivered orally the evening before; they offered the\r\nfullest reparation, expressing their willingness to indemnify the wounded\r\nmen, and to make provision for their families should they unfortunately\r\ndie. Nothing could be more dignified or more satisfactory in every way\r\nthan the language which they held—a notable contrast to our experiences\r\nof Bakufu days. Sir Harry Parkes had made no complaint and demanded\r\nno reparation. The action of the Government was as spontaneous as it\r\nwas noble: what a blessing it was to be quit of the old wrangling and\r\nbullying which alone bore fruit a few months before.\r\n\r\nThe envoys begged that Sir Harry would not allow the madly wicked act\r\nof a few ruffians to stand between the Mikado and friendship with\r\nForeign Powers. It would have been churlish not to meet them halfway and\r\naccordingly the visit which had been so cruelly interrupted was fixed to\r\ntake place on the day after the morrow.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the whole affair calmly, it seems miraculous, first that\r\ntwo men should have risked certain death in attacking a party of some\r\nseventy Englishmen armed with all the newest weapons (though, as I have\r\nsaid, our escort were badly hampered in the use of their lances which\r\nafter this episode we discarded), and secondly that they should have been\r\nable to work such havoc before they were stopped. It only shows how much\r\nmischief a man may do if he does not try to save his own skin—that is\r\nthe whole essence of success in running amok. If he is faint-hearted and\r\nlooks to his own safety, he cannot do much harm. Another wonder was that\r\nSir Harry, conspicuous in his gold-embroidered coat, should have escaped\r\nscatheless. Obviously it was a blind fury. The attack was irrational\r\nand to us unintelligible; but the Jō-i were animated by the spirit of\r\na priest of Isé, who lived a century earlier, and wrote a patriotic\r\npamphlet, proving that the children of Japan are the offspring of the\r\ngods—the rest of the world the issue of dogs and cats. Was it meet and\r\nproper that the descendants of cats and dogs should defile the city,\r\nthe court, and even the sacred presence of the Son of Heaven? Among the\r\npapers of our prisoner was found a document setting forth his political\r\ncreed; he admitted belonging to the Jō-i—the anti-foreign party; he\r\nthought it right that the Mikado should govern; he had heard that a\r\nbarbarian doctor had polluted the holy city (this alluding to Willis’ two\r\nvisits with Satow and myself; so a mission of charity was turned into\r\nan excuse for murder!). Three days later he was deprived of his rank as\r\nSamurai, and put to death by the common headsman.\r\n\r\nThe Mikado’s Government announced that they were prepared to strike\r\nat the root of all this fanaticism. They declared that the murder or\r\ninsulting of foreigners, hitherto regarded by the fanatics as acts of\r\nheroism, was an infamous and wicked crime, and they were prepared to\r\npublish a decree enacting that those guilty of such acts should be\r\ndeprived of their swords, their names struck off the roll of Samurai,\r\nthat they should be executed as felons without the privilege of\r\n_Hara-kiri_, and that after death their heads should be exposed on the\r\nexecution ground. We were bound to confess that such a decree as this\r\nwould indeed be a drastic measure, meaning far more to a Samurai than the\r\nWestern man would generally realize.\r\n\r\nI should add here that the Queen presented swords of honour to Gotō\r\nShōjirō and Nakai in recognition of the gallantry with which they\r\nprotected her minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the 26th of March, the third day of the third moon; an auspicious\r\nday in the omens of which the most punctilious of soothsayers could find\r\nno fault or foreboding of evil. The tragically postponed audience of the\r\nMikado was now to take place. The Government were naturally very anxious\r\nafter the events of two days before, and extraordinary precautions were\r\ntaken to prevent the recurrence of any such misadventure. From early dawn\r\nthe many-acred courts of the temple were crowded with men-at-arms arrayed\r\nin all the panoply of ancient armour, with helmets and mustachioed\r\nvizors. The picturesque figures of these warriors, framed in the setting\r\nof the heavy-eaved architecture of the sacred buildings, were striking\r\neven to us who by this time were tolerably well used to such startling\r\nsights.\r\n\r\nHow would it have struck an Englishman transported on the carpet of\r\nsome Afrit or Jinn of the “Arabian Nights” out of the everyday moil and\r\ntoil of Fleet Street into the midst of all this medieval glamour? Were\r\nwe back in the middle of the eleventh century, in the days of the wars\r\nwhen the white flag of the Minamoto was borne out to battle against the\r\nred standard of the Taira?—days when gods and fairies took sides in the\r\nstruggle, as in the old fights before Troy? Two great Daimios, Prince\r\nDaté, the Inkiyō of Uwajima, and the Prince of Hizen, had been told off\r\nto conduct us in person to the Palace; their retainers, more numerous\r\nthan the tail of a Highland chieftain, armed with tasselled spears and\r\nother weapons of the olden time, made a brave show.\r\n\r\nOur own retinue was sadly reduced. Our mounted escort could only muster\r\ntwo men, who with drawn swords rode on either side of Sir Harry. Satow\r\nand I rode immediately behind him. The drawn swords, I should mention,\r\nwere very significant, and would have a startling effect in the streets\r\nof Kiōto, for in Japan the blade was never bared save for bloodshed,\r\nand the sight of them would have a meaning which my readers can hardly\r\nrealize. However, there was no need for their use this time. The streets\r\nwere admirably kept, and although huge crowds had gathered together to\r\nsee our procession, they were quite orderly, and there was no sign of\r\nany disturbance—which would have been almost impossible—nor was there an\r\nugly word uttered. We had a longish way to go, and reached the Gosho, the\r\nImperial Palace, at about one o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe Palace of the Son of Heaven, unlike the dwellings of most Oriental\r\npotentates, who delight in show and magnificence (indeed has not\r\n“oriental splendour” become a proverbial expression?), was chiefly marked\r\nby a noble simplicity; it was not even fortified, but was surrounded by\r\nplain whitewashed walls topped with grey tiles, of which the nine gates,\r\nas I have already said, were each committed to the charge of the troops\r\nof one of the great Daimios. Still, in spite of its studied plainness,\r\nthe Gosho was not without a certain grandeur of its own. There was none\r\nof that economy of space which always makes a mean effect; the courtyards\r\nwere vast and kept scrupulously clean with fresh white sand; the\r\nbuildings, of which there were many, although entirely without ornament,\r\nwere large and roomy, bearing a great stamp of dignity.\r\n\r\nAt the inner gate of ceremony, the gate used by princes of the blood,\r\nwe dismounted and were led by the great officers of State through a\r\nsuccession of courtyards to a waiting-room, where we were received by\r\nYamashina no Miya, a cousin of the Emperor. Here we were plied with\r\nsweetmeats, sponge cake,[9] tea and talk, waiting until the Mikado, who\r\nwas eating his mid-day meal, should be ready to hold his Court.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to see in the flesh, if I may use the expression,\r\na scene such as we are familiar with in the paintings on ancient gilt\r\nscreens and kakémonos. The court dress had a peculiar _cachet_, a\r\n“flavour” as the Chinese would put it, of its own. The black cap\r\n(_yéboshi_) tied under the chin had something of the effect of the\r\nhuge piles of hair worn by women, which one sees caricatured about the\r\nthirties of the nineteenth century. The coat was of dark silk, hanging\r\nloose, with long, wide sleeves, and the sword was slung instead of being\r\nthrust into the girdle, sticking out behind like a tail. The trousers\r\nwere baggy and clumsy in make, of lighter-coloured stuff than the coat.\r\n\r\nBut the strangest part to our eyes of the whole get-up were the\r\nshoes—huge black lacquer sabots worn in crossing the courtyards, but of\r\ncourse doffed on entering a room, so constructed that the wearer had to\r\nshuffle along in the most uncertain fashion, the very parody of walking.\r\nThe costume altogether might appear grotesque to a new-comer, but we had\r\nso long learned to associate it with the dignity of old tradition that\r\nits oddness had ceased to raise our wonder.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden, as we were waiting in the ante-room, there arose the wild\r\nand picturesque strains of flute, mouth-organ, lute, drums and other\r\ninstruments of string, wood and percussion, belonging to his Majesty’s\r\nprivate band,—a curious wailing music. Here again we had something with\r\na flavour entirely its own, though one of the Japanese gentlemen who had\r\nbeen in England said that it reminded him of the Italian opera. The power\r\nof the imagination could hardly go further.\r\n\r\nIs there anything so utterly odious as waiting? The three of us, Parkes,\r\nSatow and myself, had worked and waited many months, not altogether in\r\nsafety, for this consummation of a policy which we, loving Japan, and\r\nat the same time penetrated with a sense of its importance for England,\r\nindeed for the world, knew to be right. But now this last half-hour of\r\nsponge cake and compliments seemed interminable.\r\n\r\nAt last! At last (I pray forgiveness if I dwell upon our impatience) we\r\nwere ushered into the Presence. Only Sir Harry Parkes and myself were\r\nto be presented—Satow, by far the most important man of the three, not\r\nhaving at that time been presented at our own Court, could not, according\r\nto etiquette, be presented to a foreign sovereign. Unfortunately the\r\nrain, which had been threatening all the morning, had begun to fall in\r\ntorrents, so we had to splash through the various courtyards, ankle-deep\r\nin wet sand. Guards of honour were stationed at intervals—an unknown\r\nsight in the precincts of the Gosho, into the inner enclosure of which no\r\nsoldiers had up to that time been admitted. We were introduced into the\r\nAudience Hall by the Prince of Hizen.\r\n\r\nPassing up a double flight of steps we entered the audience chamber, a\r\nlong hall forming one side of a courtyard of which the remaining three\r\nsides were a verandah open only on the inside. In this verandah sat the\r\nband, clothed in red, blue and gaudy colours, with lacquer caps upon\r\ntheir heads. The Presence Chamber itself was a long room, very simple\r\nand plain. In the centre was a canopy supported by four slender pillars\r\nof black lacquer draped with white silk, into which was woven a pattern\r\nin red and black; the drapery was caught up and festooned with black and\r\nred ribbons. On the inside of each of the two front pillars stood a lion,\r\ncuriously carved in wood, the one black, the other gilt, about two feet\r\nhigh. Like our own Lion and Unicorn they had some mystic meaning, some\r\nhidden connection with the Kingly order.\r\n\r\nUnder the canopy was the young Mikado, seated in, or rather, leaning\r\nagainst, a high chair. Behind him knelt two Princes of the blood, ready\r\nto prompt him, if need should be, in the playing of his part. Outside the\r\ncanopy and in front of His Majesty knelt two other Princes of the blood.\r\nOn a raised floor decked with costly green silk, close to the canopy,\r\nstood Sir Harry and myself, our conductor, the Prince of Hizen, kneeling\r\nbeside us. On one side Ito Shunské, Governor of Hiōgo, who was to act as\r\ninterpreter, was also kneeling. On either side of the canopy in a double\r\nor treble row, extending to the end of the Hall, stood the great Princes\r\nof the Empire, men such as Satsuma, Chōshiu, Uwajima, Kaga, and other\r\ngreat nobles—to us, up to that time, no more than names, but now realized\r\nin the flesh. It certainly was a very imposing sight; perhaps it is\r\ndifficult to convey an idea of all that it meant to us, who had worked so\r\nhard to this end.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the room the Son of Heaven rose and acknowledged our bows.\r\nHe was at that time a tall youth with a bright eye and clear complexion;\r\nhis demeanour was very dignified, well becoming the heir of a dynasty\r\nmany centuries older than any other sovereignty on the face of the globe.\r\nHe was dressed in a white coat with long padded trousers of crimson silk\r\ntrailing like a lady’s court-train. His head-dress was the same as that\r\nof his courtiers, though as a rule it was surmounted by a long, stiff,\r\nflat plume of black gauze. I call it a plume for want of a better word,\r\nbut there was nothing feathery about it. His eyebrows were shaved off\r\nand painted in high up on the forehead; his cheeks were rouged and his\r\nlips painted with red and gold. His teeth were blackened. It was no small\r\nfeat to look dignified under such a travesty of nature; but the _sangre\r\nAzul_ would not be denied. It was not long, I may add, before the young\r\nsovereign cast adrift all these worn-out fashions and trammels of past\r\nages, together with much else that was out of date.\r\n\r\nWhen we had taken our places the Mikado addressed Sir Harry Parkes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“I hope that your Sovereign enjoys good health. I trust that the\r\nintercourse between our respective countries will become more and\r\nmore friendly and be permanently established. I regret deeply that an\r\nunfortunate affair which took place as you were on your way to the Palace\r\non the 23rd delayed this ceremony. It gives me great pleasure, therefore,\r\nto see you here to-day.”\r\n\r\nNow this speech, regarded as an oratorical or literary effort, was not\r\nvery remarkable. And yet, if we consider the circumstances, we cannot but\r\nadmit that there was in it much upon which we might fairly congratulate\r\nourselves. We were standing in the presence of a sovereign whose\r\nancestors for centuries had been to their people demigods—to foreigners\r\nalmost a myth. The sanctity of their seclusion had been inviolate, they\r\nhad held no intercourse with a world of which they knew nothing. Now,\r\nsuddenly, the veil of the temple had been rent and the Boy-God, in\r\ndefence of whose Divinity myriads of his subjects were ready gladly to\r\nlay down their lives, had descended from the clouds to take his place\r\namong the children of men, and not only that, but he had actually allowed\r\nhis sacred face to be seen by, and had held communion with, “The Beasts\r\nfrom Without.” That is how the mere fact would present itself to the\r\nminds of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThen as to the matter of the speech there was none of the old, haughty\r\narrogance of the heaven-born. The Queen was spoken of with due\r\nrespect,[10] in itself a new departure, and the apology for the outrage\r\nwhich had taken place two days before was couched in becoming language,\r\nnor had there been anything in the whole ceremonial which could wound the\r\nsusceptibilities of the most exacting foreigner. The barrier of centuries\r\nhad been broken down, and Japan was ready to enter into the comity of\r\nnations on equal terms.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from his extreme youth and the novelty of the\r\nsituation to one who had only recently left the women’s apartments, the\r\nMikado showed some symptoms of shyness. He hardly spoke above a whisper,\r\nso the words were repeated aloud by the Prince of the Blood on his right\r\nside and translated by Ito Shunské. When Sir Harry had made a suitable\r\nreply we were conducted out of the Presence Chamber by the Prince of\r\nHizen. The whole ceremony did not last much more than a quarter of an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nSo ended a ceremony which had been most imposing not only on account of\r\nits inner meaning, but also by reason of the halo of simplicity, instinct\r\nwith solemn dignity. Tradition and the atmosphere of sanctity were more\r\nstriking than all the gold and silver and jewels of an aurungzebe on his\r\npeacock throne.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th we left Kiōto. It was no easy matter to convey our poor\r\nwounded men, who had ridden into the holy city a few days before, looking\r\nso smart and handsome; however, we procured eight huge litters and\r\nmanaged to get them by easy stages to the boats. I may say here that none\r\nof them died, though several underwent great suffering, and two were\r\ncrippled for life and had to be invalided home.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Sir Harry and the rest of the Legation went back to Yokohama\r\nto look after the interests of trade, in a neighbourhood where there was\r\nstill much sporadic fighting and where the British community were not\r\nunnaturally anxious, and I was left behind at Ōsaka to keep up relations\r\nwith the new government which was to make its headquarters there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nJAPAN. SENSATION DIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I was left on my lonely job, which lasted from the last days of March\r\ntill the beginning of August. I was the only European in the great city\r\n(for the Consulate, under Mr. Russell Robertson, was far away down the\r\nriver); there were no foreign residents, and I was often for a week\r\nat a time without seeing a European face, or hearing any language but\r\nJapanese. I managed to secure a lodging not far from the office where\r\nPrince Daté and Higashi Kuzé were conducting foreign affairs and I lived\r\nin Japanese fashion on rice and fish, with which I was served from a\r\nneighbouring cook-shop.\r\n\r\nIt was the hardest-worked time of my life. Parkes, at the request of\r\nthe Japanese, had chosen me for the task because he was in that way\r\nable to dispense with depriving himself of one of his interpreters; my\r\norders were to communicate not only with him, but also directly with the\r\nForeign Office at home, whenever an opportunity should offer by a passing\r\nman-of-war. I had therefore to copy every one of my drafts in duplicate,\r\nand my communications with the Japanese Ministers in triplicate, as\r\naccording to treaty I was obliged to send my despatches in English as\r\nwell as in Japanese, and of course the translation into Japanese was an\r\nimmense addition to my labours. There was, moreover, rarely a day when\r\nthe Ministers did not expect to have an interview, often very lengthy,\r\nupon some subject or other, and visitors from the various clans often\r\ncame to discuss politics and air their views. In this way I was at work\r\nfrom early dawn till night, and kept two Japanese secretaries constantly\r\nemployed. Neither of them knew a word of English, so they were only of\r\nuse as amanuenses for their own language. I may say here in passing that\r\nwhen the Foreign Office asked the Treasury to reimburse me the money\r\nthat I had paid for their salaries the answer was that I seemed to have\r\nmade good use of my opportunities, and if I had earned any reward I must\r\nseek for it in my own profession. That is the return which I got for\r\nwork which was no part of my business as secretary, and which actually\r\ncost me money. In addition to my written work I had to have interminable\r\ninterviews with Prince Daté and Higashi Kuzé at the Foreign Office, or\r\nto receive them and many of the leading Japanese in my own house. Often\r\nI worked from twelve to fourteen hours. “Bob” Lowe, afterwards Lord\r\nSherbrooke, was Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Foreign Office sent\r\nin the claim on my behalf. He was always a very good friend to me, and\r\ntold me that he refused because he thought he would be doing me a good\r\nturn, which, he said, I thoroughly deserved. So between two friendly\r\nstools I fell to the ground!\r\n\r\nCaptain du Petit Thouars in the _Dupleix_ was left to watch over French\r\ninterests. He was one of the most charming of men, an ornament to the\r\nFrench Navy. He died in 1890 (?) as Vice-Admiral at Brest, having\r\nrendered brilliant service on shore during the war of 1870. As soon as\r\nour respective ministers’ backs were turned I went to him and pointed\r\nout how absurd and harmful were the jealousies and intrigues which had\r\ngone on between the two Legations. I told him that I would keep him\r\naccurately informed as to anything that might happen on shore, and hoped\r\nthat he, being in the roadstead on board his ship, would let me know of\r\nany maritime movement that might take place. I said that we still had\r\nto deal with a crisis which was far from settled, and that I could not\r\nconceive that our interests should not be identical. He quite agreed, and\r\nso we determined to work together in the common cause. He was as loyal as\r\nhis own sword, and we became fast friends. During those critical months\r\nneither of us could often leave his post, so we seldom met; when we did\r\nit was a privilege to be the friend of such a man.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, a solitary life that I led—the life of a recluse.\r\nHow my London friends would have stared at my surroundings! I rigged\r\nup a table at which to write, and a chair—those were indispensable;\r\notherwise my long, narrow room was innocent of furniture other than\r\ntwo handsome screens, still in my possession, which shut off my bedless\r\nsleeping-place, where I lay like a Japanese gentleman on a quilt, and\r\nslept the sleep of the man that is mentally and physically tired out. My\r\nverandah opened on to a slip of garden not much larger than a good-sized\r\ndining-table—a little gem in its way, with a miniature Mount Fuji, a\r\nshrine to Inari sama, a forest, a waterfall plashing into a lake, in\r\nwhich were several fan-tailed gold-fish.\r\n\r\nI hardly expect to be believed when I write that one day, as I was\r\nsitting at work, I saw a huge otter come sneaking into my little\r\nparadise. I cocked my Spencer rifle—the friend that I always kept at\r\nhand, for there were plenty of scowling Jō-i about—but the enemy heard\r\nthe click and bolted before I could get a shot at him. It was a strange\r\ninvasion in a city of some half million of souls!\r\n\r\nApart from the ordinary work of our relations with the Foreign Office\r\nthere were two matters which Sir Harry had specially entrusted to me. The\r\none was to insist upon the publication, without delay, of the new law\r\nwith regard to attacks upon foreigners, and the second was to watch over\r\nthe case of the Urakami Christians. Neither of these was an easy matter\r\nto deal with.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from my translation of the law that it was an edict which\r\nmust have needed great courage on the part of the new Government to draw\r\nup and still greater courage to publish, as they had promised to do,\r\nthroughout the Empire. It said:\r\n\r\n    “Now that the Imperial Government has been newly established,\r\n    in obedience to the principles of the Court it has been\r\n    commanded that friendly relations shall exist with foreign\r\n    countries, and that all matters should be treated directly by\r\n    the Imperial Court. The treaties will be observed according\r\n    to international law, and the people of the whole country,\r\n    receiving with gratitude the expression of the Imperial Will,\r\n    are hereby ordered to rest assured upon this point. From\r\n    henceforth those persons who by violently slaying foreigners\r\n    or otherwise insulting them would rebel against the Imperial\r\n    commands and brew trouble in the country, and all other\r\n    persons whatsoever, are hereby ordered to behave in a friendly\r\n    manner. Those who do not uphold the majesty and good faith of\r\n    their country in the eyes of the world, being guilty of most\r\n    audacious crime, will, in accordance with the heinousness of\r\n    their offence, even should they belong to the Samurai class,\r\n    be stripped of their rank and will meet with a suitable\r\n    punishment. Let all men receive these Imperial commands by\r\n    which riotous conduct, however slight, is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n                            “Published at Kiōto, March 28th (1868).”\r\n\r\nThis decree naturally aroused great susceptibilities. To strip a Samurai\r\nof his rank deprived him of the right of execution by _hara-kiri_; he\r\nwould have to die by the sword of the common executioner, his head would\r\nbe exposed on the pillory, and his property would be forfeited; he\r\nwould be reduced to the level of the lowest scum of the earth, and his\r\nfamily would be ruined and wiped out. Only think of what that must mean\r\nto these proud and chivalrous heirs of the centuries! The privilege of\r\nself-immolation was one of the dearest and most precious rights of the\r\nvery class which had brought about the revolution, the class, indeed, to\r\nwhich the members of the Government themselves belonged. However anxious\r\nthe Government might be to issue such an edict all over the country—and\r\nit was impossible to doubt their sincerity in the matter—they were in\r\ngreat difficulties. They were obviously wishful to do everything that\r\nthey could to conciliate foreign Powers and to enable their country to\r\ntake an honourable place among the nations; their own interests were at\r\nstake, as well as ours, and this they felt.\r\n\r\nThey tried hard to persuade me to let them defer the publication of\r\nthe edict until it could be incorporated in a new code of laws which,\r\nthey said, was about to be drawn up. To this I had resolutely to refuse\r\nassent. At the same time I could not but see that they had to consider\r\nold prejudices, old jealousies, old hatreds; “rust cannot be cleared off\r\nan old blade with one rubbing;” they had to go forward warily. However,\r\nto cut short a long story and the record of many an hour of debate,\r\nevery minute of which increased my respect for Prince Daté and Higashi\r\nKuzé, I succeeded in getting the government to post the famous edict in\r\nevery town, village and hamlet throughout the land. My chief was greatly\r\npleased. It was a triumph for which he received great kudos.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Urakami Christians furnished me with a still more\r\ndifficult task.\r\n\r\n“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send\r\npeace, but a sword.” In no country did these words, with the terrible\r\nforecasts that follow them, prove more true than in Japan. When St.\r\nFrancis Xavier, under the guidance of a gentleman of the Satsuma clan,\r\nreached the land of Sunrise, the great missionary met with many troubles,\r\nbut was rewarded by great successes.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to tell the story of the first efforts to Christianize\r\nJapan—suffice it to say here, that all went well until the heavy-footed,\r\nclumsy Franciscans in Japan, as in China, trampled to death the seed\r\nof religion which had been sown and diligently watered by the more\r\ndelicate Jesuits. Interference with the laws and internal affairs of the\r\ncountry were meat and drink to the Franciscans, so that the great Kido\r\nwas historically justified when, on one occasion, he said: “It seems to\r\nme that missionaries are men who are sent here to teach the people to\r\ndisobey the laws of their country.” Those who are curious in such matters\r\nwill find the history of the persecutions—sometimes, it must be admitted,\r\nretaliations—admirably told in Mr. Longford’s “Story of Old Japan.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe persecutions of Hidéyoshi and Iyéyasu failed entirely to outroot\r\nChristianity; it simply disappeared out of sight. There were in many\r\nparts of the country small scattered colonies of Christians, faithful\r\nmen who, without the teaching of a priest or the ministrations of a\r\npastor, clung to the creed for which more than two centuries before\r\ntheir forefathers had been tortured and perished. It must have been a\r\nvery simple form of faith without much dogma about it, but they believed\r\nin God and worshipped the Saviour who had died for their sins, and\r\nthat was enough. One such colony existed at Urakami, a village not far\r\nfrom Nagasaki, the chief scene of the old persecutions, a community\r\nentirely composed of Christians, numbering some four thousand souls. The\r\nreactionaries at the Court of Kiōto had determined that these people must\r\nbe put to the sword and extirpated.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not surprising that the resumption of power by the Mikado\r\nshould have led to a revival of Shintō, the religion of the Gods, from\r\nwhom he claimed descent. The more bigoted of the men by whom the Emperor\r\nwas surrounded, new to government and little suspecting the troubles\r\nwhich, in the altered condition of things, religious intolerance could\r\nnot fail to bring upon their country, were fired by zeal for the old\r\nworship, and they demanded the extirpation of the religion in which they\r\nsaw its chief enemies. Urakami was a prominent and notorious centre of\r\nthat faith, and its people must be the first victims.\r\n\r\nIf we put ourselves for a moment in the place of the new ministers, it\r\nis not difficult to realize the anxious thought which this movement,\r\neven more than the question of the new edict mentioned above, must have\r\ncaused them. Bigotry and fanaticism are terrible foes to fight, and, in\r\nthis particular instance, the trouble must have been increased by the\r\nknowledge that any disinclination to proceed to extremities would be set\r\ndown as something akin to disloyalty to the Emperor and a denial of his\r\ndivine rights. The ministers with whom I had to deal were large-minded\r\nmen with liberal views, but they, on their side, had to reckon with\r\nimportant personages, who, after being immured, as their forbears had\r\nbeen for centuries, in the mystic darkness of a prehistoric cloister,\r\nwere no more fit to face the sunlight of the nineteenth century than\r\nthose perhaps fabulous batrachians which have whitened for aeons untold,\r\nencased in the crevices of the limestone rock. In a little time they were\r\nto face it, and they did so gloriously; but the day had not come yet, and\r\nthey were still purblind.\r\n\r\nThe sudden awakening of a sovereign and his court from the sleep of eight\r\ncenturies was a wonder which still, after some fifty years, reads like\r\na fairy tale even to those who witnessed it. Among the men who composed\r\nit there was no great wealth, no ostentation to dazzle the eye—and yet\r\neverything to fascinate the imagination. These men, dwelling in simple\r\nhouses, living frugally—even poorly—were surrounded by a halo before\r\nwhich the territorial magnates, lords of great castles, with all their\r\npomp and splendour and martial glitter, had to humble themselves. The\r\nKugé believed, and they could make others believe, that for all their\r\napparent poverty and humility they were in some mysterious way trustees\r\nfor the glory of the Gods, from whom, like their divine Emperor, they\r\nclaimed descent.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, amongst men who had lived in the mystery of ancestral\r\nseclusion, unbroken by any sign or sound from without, there must be\r\na majority among whom it would be idle to expect an immediate flow of\r\nliberal ideas; they thought as their fathers thought, as their forbears\r\nhad thought in the eleventh century, when the veil was drawn over the\r\nholy city and all light shut out till now. Some there were who amazed us\r\nby the way in which they met the new situation. Physically, inbreeding\r\nhad done its work. Many of the nobles were puny, pale and anæmic ghosts,\r\nin whom Dr. Willis, a sound observer, found many signs of hereditary\r\ndegeneration. Others again, equally bearing the stamp of aristocratic\r\ndescent, were strong and well nurtured. Side by side with Daté, the burly\r\nInkiyō of Uwajima, Higashi Kuzé, the Court noble was not imposing in\r\nstature, but his mind was clear and nimble, and indeed, it was wonderful\r\nto watch the success with which many of these recluses, whose lives had\r\nbeen spent in the iteration of dull and mentally exhausting ceremonies,\r\nthrew themselves into the whirlpool of affairs.\r\n\r\nIwakura, for instance, who afterwards went as Ambassador to Europe,\r\nwas one of the most pliant of the new statesmen with whom we came into\r\ncontact. The three brothers Saionji, and some others, were born men\r\nof the world. But these men of more advanced views were few and far\r\nbetween, and amongst the others there can be no doubt that our friends\r\nin preaching toleration had an even more difficult task than that which\r\nlay before Disraeli when he started upon educating his party. Had the\r\nEmperor been a little older his generous spirit would have lightened\r\ntheir burden. But he was a mere boy, not yet able to make his personal\r\ninfluence felt. It was not long in coming; for among the heroes of the\r\ndays of the restoration none deserve more admiration and respect than\r\nthe Emperor Mutsu Hito. Hardly was he freed from the luxurious care\r\nand tender coddling of the women’s quarters than he was forced to take\r\nup his august inheritance at a moment of storm and stress for which the\r\nhistory of his country—perhaps we might say, of the world—furnishes no\r\nparallel. He faced the ordeal manfully from the very first, and he seems\r\nat once to have recognized the importance of the fact that the days of\r\nJapan’s isolation had come to an end, and that, if the Land of the Gods\r\nwas to preserve its dignity, it must be by casting off the old slough of\r\ntradition and prejudice.\r\n\r\nBefore many years had elapsed he made himself a real, and not a nominal,\r\npower. The full measure of his personal weight will perhaps never be\r\nknown. What we do know is that he was a most generous monarch, an\r\nindefatigable worker, and that he had the art of surrounding himself with\r\nthe best and wisest advisers. Had he been opposed to a forward policy\r\nthe prestige which attached to the Son of Heaven would have enabled him\r\nto stay the hands of the clock; his power of obstruction would have been\r\nalmost unlimited. As a matter of fact his action was always in favour of\r\nprogress, and in nothing did he show this more conspicuously than in the\r\nattitude which, from the first, he took up towards foreigners. Doubtless,\r\nin the earlier days he, like his ministers, had to be careful not to run\r\ntoo violently against tradition and prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the policy of the new government, in regard to\r\nthe native Christians, it is essential that these very real difficulties\r\nwhich they had to encounter should be understood. In dealing with them,\r\nDaté and Higashi Kuzé evidently knew that they had to conciliate a number\r\nof their more retrograde peers who might easily wreck the ship. Their\r\nhand was not an easy one to play; they held but one trump card—national\r\nambition, which could not but be frustrated by disregarding the public\r\nopinion of the world, and even that card they must persuade others to\r\ntake at trump value; a little too great precipitancy, a little lack of\r\ncaution, and they might raise a storm of fanaticism which it would be\r\nhard to quell and which might ruin their game. In our discussions I had\r\nto minimize dangers which I knew to be no sham, and to lay stress upon\r\nadvantages of which the government were probably as well aware as I was.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty with which I had to contend was the danger of appearing to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of the country. No foreigner’s safety\r\nor welfare was at stake. There was not a single missionary concerned. The\r\nforeign legations then could not do more than offer friendly advice and\r\nthat, too, in the most discreet fashion. Day after day and week after\r\nweek we carried on our weary debates; but at any rate I was at last\r\nable to obtain the assurance that there would be no massacre, no such\r\npersecution, no such wholesale cruelty, as had stained the early days of\r\nthe seventeenth century. So far it was a triumph, well worth the pains it\r\ncost, but I was certain that there must be some temporary sacrifice to\r\nthe old-world prejudices of the Court, which were still too strong to be\r\naltogether ignored. That sacrifice would take the shape of deportation.\r\nWhen in the month of August I returned to Yokohama I found Sir Harry\r\nParkes just about to start for a conference with the colleagues. “What\r\nam I to tell them?” he asked. I answered that he might assure them that\r\nthere was no danger, such as had at one time been dreaded, there would\r\nbe no executions—no torture—that the utmost that would be done would be\r\na breaking up of the community at Urakami, that the families would be\r\ndistributed among various clans, and that I did not believe that even\r\nthat measure of intolerance would be of long duration. Sir Harry was\r\ndelighted with the result of my negotiations and went off in great glee\r\nto reassure the colleagues. It was really a great victory. My forecast\r\nwas correct; though, in 1870, there was a fresh outburst of fanatical\r\nzeal and many families were exiled, in 1872, with the new and generous\r\norder of things, the exiles were restored to their homes; missionaries\r\nare now free all over the country, and who will may be baptized.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pleasure of having independent and responsible work to do\r\nI confess that I was not sorry when my exile at Ōsaka came to an end. It\r\nhad been a lonely time in the midst of an obviously hostile community.\r\nThe heat had been intense—the work very laborious, no rest from morning\r\ntill night, food none too plentiful, though, indeed, there was little\r\ntemptation to eat. I was, moreover, run down and out of health. So I was\r\ndelighted when my good friend du Petit Thouars sent to say that he was\r\nleaving for Yokohama and would give me a berth, as he heard that I, too,\r\nwas to rejoin my chief.\r\n\r\nThose were halcyon days on board the _Dupleix_. The too often storm-vexed\r\nInland Sea was a dream of beauty, its countless smiles rippling under a\r\ncloudless sky. The ship was the perfection of comfort, the cook a genius,\r\nand my host—one of the most agreeable companions, a man whose goodness of\r\nheart was equalled by his wit and the catholicity of his reading. His men\r\nadored him, and no wonder!\r\n\r\nI was quickly back in my fairy-tale quarters in the little temple of\r\nMonriuin, overlooking the Bay of Yedo—soon to become Tōkiō, in order that\r\nthe last vestige of the power of the Tokugawa family might be swept away.\r\nMy little temple home was not much bigger than a doll’s house, but it was\r\nvery pretty and snug and to a tired and overworked man it was a delight\r\nto slip on a bath-gown in the early morning and drink in the refreshing\r\nbreezes which came blowing into the garden from over the sea.\r\n\r\nI had plenty to amuse me, and leisure to go on plodding at my “Tales\r\nof Old Japan,” which were growing in bulk. The stories themselves were\r\nnot such hard work; but the notes and appendices involved much labour\r\nin looking up authorities and gathering together odds and ends of\r\ninformation. Parkes used to say that, if ever the book was published,\r\nthey would be the best part of it.\r\n\r\nThe civil war was now practically at an end. The Shōgun, shorn of his\r\nrank, was easing his scholarly mind in the composition of Chinese poetry\r\nin his romantic castle of Shidzuoka, the favourite castle of his great\r\nancestor Iyéyasu, where, leading the life of a country gentleman, he for\r\nsome forty years devoted himself to agricultural pursuits, especially to\r\nimproving the cultivation of tea. In this way he found good employment\r\nfor the vast number of retainers whom he was unable to support as in\r\nold days, but whom he would not turn adrift. He was a kind and generous\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThere was still fighting in the north, and the Prince of Aidzu did\r\nnot capitulate until towards the end of the year. Enomoto, who was in\r\ncommand of the ships of the Tokugawa, had taken his fleet to Hakodaté in\r\nthe island of Yesso, where he was joined by Captain Brunet and another\r\nofficer of the _mission militaire_, and by one or two French midshipmen\r\nfrom the _Minerve_. Enomoto’s attempt to proclaim a republic in Yesso\r\nwas an utter failure; by the month of June, 1869, he was hopelessly\r\ndefeated; the French officers, who had surrendered to their own naval\r\ncommander, were shipped off on board the _Coetlogon_ to Yokohama, where\r\nM. Outrey, who had succeeded M. Léon Roches as French Minister, would\r\nnot even allow them to land, but ingloriously packed them off in the\r\n_Dupleix_ to Saigon. The departure of these troublesome French gentlemen\r\nwith their tails between their legs, was a source of infinite joy to Sir\r\nHarry Parkes, and of great relief to M. Outrey, who had been much annoyed\r\nby their conduct. Enomoto himself, the arch-rebel, was forgiven, and was\r\nafterwards Japanese Minister in Peking.\r\n\r\nAll these things, however, took place months after my arrival in Yedo.\r\nThe great city through which the furies had been raging so violently,\r\nburning temples, setting fire to _yashikis_, fighting, murdering,\r\ncrucifying,[12] the streets ringing with the fierce war-songs of the\r\nclansmen, was now at peace. The days floated by uneventfully in a dull\r\nmonotone which was a new and, to tell the truth, delicious sensation; it\r\nwas long since I had enjoyed such a feeling of peace and security. Now\r\nand then some visitor would come, eager to be shown the historic beauties\r\nof the famous place; now and then I had to ride to Yokohama on Legation\r\nbusiness; otherwise the silence of Monriuin was unbroken.\r\n\r\nIt was a blessed calm after the storm. Still, it would not have been\r\nwise as yet to lay aside revolver and sword, for so long as the Samurai\r\nwere allowed to wear sword and dirk there was always the danger lest\r\nsome fanatic swashbuckler, perhaps in his cups, might empty his scabbard\r\nin our honour. A blow would soon be given, and we had had experience\r\nenough of what Captain du Petit Thouars called “le marteau rasoir”—a\r\ngood definition of the heavily-weighted, keen-edged _katana_. The law\r\ndepriving the Samurai of the right to carry the _dai-sho_, sword and\r\ndirk, was one of the wisest enactments of the new _régime_, but that was\r\nnot to come for many a long month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nBETWIXT OLD AND NEW JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period upon which we were now entering was of singular interest and\r\nhistorical importance. It was the connecting link between the old Japan\r\nand the new, a transition-time in which the ancient feudalism still spoke\r\n(indeed, one may ask whether its voice is even now, in 1915, quite hushed\r\nto silence?) when many schemes were fought out, some still-born, some\r\ndoomed to a swift death, others, embryonic at first, but fated to grow\r\ninto greatness.\r\n\r\nOf these none was more significant, none more pregnant with consequences\r\nthan the remission by the Daimios into the hands of the Mikado of the\r\ngreat fiefs which they had held from time immemorial. This, as I have\r\nshown, sprang out of the proposal of the Daimios that the Tokugawa family\r\nshould be made to give up lands bringing in a revenue of two millions\r\n_kokus_ of rice; and it was to that remarkable man, my friend Prince\r\nYōdo, the Inkiyō of Tosa, that the credit belongs of seeing that, having\r\nonce started on a forward policy, they must be prepared to go on with\r\nit, and that the consolidation of the Empire must of necessity involve\r\nthe creation of an Imperial revenue, together with the abolition of\r\nprovincial home rule. At the same time no little praise is due to the\r\nother territorial magnates for the ease and rapidity with which they\r\nassimilated what to them must have seemed profoundly distasteful and\r\nrevolutionary ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD JAPAN.\r\n\r\n_From a water-colour drawing by C. Wirgman._]\r\n\r\nI translated the first memorial announcing the laying at the foot\r\nof the throne the vast ancestral territories, signed by Mori Saisho\r\nChinjo (Chōshiu), Shimadzu Shosho (Satsuma), Nabeshima Shosho (Hizen),\r\nYamanouchi Shosho (Tosa). It was published in the _Kiōto Gazette_ of the\r\n5th of March, 1869, and is worth giving in full, for it was a document\r\nwhich made history.\r\n\r\n    “In the opinion of certain ministers (the writers) the Great\r\n    Body must not lose a single day, the Great Strength must not\r\n    delegate its power for one day. Since the heavenly ancestors\r\n    established the foundations of the country the Imperial line\r\n    has lasted without a break for ten thousand ages. The Heaven\r\n    and the Earth belong to the Emperor; there is no man who is\r\n    not his servant. This constitutes the Great Body. The Emperor\r\n    governs his people, conferring rank and property. It is his to\r\n    give and his to take away; of our own selves we cannot hold a\r\n    foot of land, we cannot take a single man. This constitutes the\r\n    Great Strength.\r\n\r\n    “In the days of old the Emperor governed the sea-girt land,\r\n    and trusting to the Great Body and to the Great Strength, the\r\n    Imperial wisdom ruled over all; thus truth and righteousness\r\n    being upheld, there was prosperity under Heaven. In the Middle\r\n    Ages the ropes of the net were loosened, so that men playing\r\n    with the Great Strength and striving for the power crowded\r\n    upon the Emperor, and half the world tried to enslave the\r\n    people and to steal the land. Beating and gnawing, theft and\r\n    rapine, ruled in the land. When the Great Body that should\r\n    have been preserved, and the Great Strength that should have\r\n    been maintained, were gone, no means were left for repressing\r\n    these evils. Traitors encouraged traitors and the strong preyed\r\n    upon and devoured the weak. The greater traitors seized tens\r\n    of provinces, the lesser traitors maintained retainers by the\r\n    thousand. Then arose the Bakufu, which also parcelled out\r\n    territories and men as might seem good to it, among private\r\n    individuals, thus planting and stablishing its own power. So it\r\n    came about that the Emperor wore a vain and empty rank, and,\r\n    the order of things being reversed, looked up to the Bakufu as\r\n    the dispenser of joy and sorrow. For six hundred years and more\r\n    the waters turned from their course have flooded the land and\r\n    reached to Heaven.\r\n\r\n    “During this time the Bakufu borrowed the name and authority\r\n    of the Emperor to hide the traces of thefts of lands and men,\r\n    being forced to use the Imperial name as a screen, since the\r\n    relations and duties of the vassal to his lord cannot be laid\r\n    aside after ten thousand years. Now the Great Government has\r\n    been newly restored, and the Emperor in person undertakes the\r\n    direction of affairs. This is indeed a rare and mighty event.\r\n    We have the name of an Imperial Government: we must also have\r\n    the fact. Our first duty is to illustrate our faithfulness\r\n    and to prove our loyalty. When the line of Tokugawa arose it\r\n    divided the country among its kinsfolk, and there were many who\r\n    thus founded the fortunes of their families. They waited not\r\n    to ask whether the lands and men that they received were the\r\n    gift of the Emperor. For ages until this day, they continued to\r\n    inherit these lands. Others said that their possessions were\r\n    the prize of their spears and bows, as if they had broken into\r\n    store-houses and stolen the treasures that they contained,\r\n    boasting to the soldiers round them that they had done this\r\n    regardless of their lives. Those who break into store-houses\r\n    are known by all men to be thieves, but those who rob lands and\r\n    steal men are not looked upon with suspicion. How are loyalty\r\n    and faith confused and destroyed! Now that men are looking\r\n    for an entirely new Government, the Great Body and the Great\r\n    Strength must neither be lent nor borrowed.\r\n\r\n    “Our dwelling-place is the Emperor’s land: the food which we\r\n    eat is grown by the Emperor’s men. How can we call it our own?\r\n    We now reverently offer up the list of our possessions and men,\r\n    with the prayer that the Emperor will take good measures for\r\n    rewarding those to whom reward is due and for mulcting those\r\n    to whom punishment is due. Let the Imperial commands be issued\r\n    for altering and remodelling the territories of the various\r\n    clans. Let the civil and criminal codes, the military laws down\r\n    to the rules for uniform and the construction of engines of\r\n    war, all proceed from the Emperor; let all the affairs of the\r\n    Empire, great and small, be referred to him. After this, when\r\n    the internal relations shall be upon a true footing, the Empire\r\n    will be able to take its place side by side with the other\r\n    countries of the world. This is now the most urgent duty of the\r\n    Emperor, as it is that of his servants and children. Hence it\r\n    is that we, in spite of our own folly and vileness, daring to\r\n    offer up our humble expression of loyalty upon which we pray\r\n    that the brilliance of the heavenly Sun may shine, with fear\r\n    and reverence bow the head and do homage, ready to lay down our\r\n    lives in proof of our faith.”\r\n\r\nA truly memorable document, to which, on the following day, the Emperor\r\nmade answer, saying that “His Majesty is filled with admiration of the\r\nloyalty” of the four Daimios.\r\n\r\nOther Daimios followed suit, the Prince of Echizen, however, raising the\r\nsuggestion that there should be a public debate as to whether the present\r\nwas a proper and fitting opportunity for the movement.\r\n\r\nOne Daimio, following the example of the four leaders, “has the honour\r\nhumbly to make a statement”—and a very characteristic statement it is.\r\n“The Emperor, having taken upon himself the task of ruling, the owls\r\nhave changed their cry,[13] the grass and the trees have bent to the\r\nwind. This has been one day in ten thousand years which it has been\r\nour privilege to witness. The land girdled by the sea has beheld and\r\nwondered. Deeply should I fear to retain for my own the territory which\r\nmy poor clan has received from the Emperor; therefore it is my desire to\r\noffer up my lands and my people. I humbly implore the Imperial decision.\r\n\r\n                                                  “Sd. TODA UNÉMÉ NO SHO.”\r\n\r\n                  (_Kiōto Gazette_ of March 10th, 1869.)\r\n\r\nI feel inclined to add extracts from a similar memorial by the Prince of\r\nUnshiu, taken from the _Kiōto Gazette_ of March 12th, 1869:\r\n\r\n    “Your servant Sadayasu in his folly and worthlessness, ignorant\r\n    of the laws of decorum, dares to lift up his voice in defiance\r\n    of all propriety. To discuss the affairs of the Government\r\n    of the Empire is a crime deserving ten thousand deaths....\r\n    Truly we may say that after an interval of seven hundred\r\n    years the foundation has been laid of a reformation which\r\n    shall last for ten thousand generations. The Emperor issues\r\n    his illustrious commands and the millions of the people are\r\n    purified in the reformation. Hence it is that your servant\r\n    Sadayasu, disregarding the heinousness of the crime which he\r\n    is committing, dares to offer up his humble opinion. The\r\n    affairs of the Empire may be said to have their seasons ... it\r\n    is to these seasons that we must direct our minds. The present\r\n    restoration is such a season.\r\n\r\n    “The first consideration is that the root of the tree should be\r\n    firmly planted. The root is the sovereign power; to restore the\r\n    sovereign power to the Emperor is to plant the root firmly....\r\n    In the Middle Ages the military class curtailed the possessions\r\n    of the Emperor.... In their mutual struggle the great swallowed\r\n    up the small, the strong took possession of the weak.... The\r\n    feudal Princes presented the picture of a land divided into\r\n    petty kingdoms maintained by force ... so that the people of\r\n    the remote districts knew not that above all there was One who\r\n    was Lord of the myriads and of the millions. How can such a\r\n    grief be endured? But now that the tangled machinery of the\r\n    State has been renewed, the myriads and the millions, purified\r\n    in the overflowing dews of the deep benevolence, will at once\r\n    reverently recognize their Emperor, and the roots of the tree\r\n    will be firmly planted. The roots being firmly planted, the\r\n    branches and leaves will flourish luxuriantly. How much the\r\n    more, now that friendly relations exist with foreign countries,\r\n    should we place our divine country under the sovereign rule,\r\n    and setting up our Emperor as the Head of the Universe, and\r\n    restoring the singleness of the supreme power, illustrate its\r\n    virtue and strength to the four seas.\r\n\r\n    “Your servant Sadayasu acknowledges gratefully that, degenerate\r\n    as he is, he is yet the chief of the least of all the clans.\r\n    At a moment so auspicious as the present, how can he refrain\r\n    from expressing his humble opinion? Cheerfully braving the\r\n    punishment of the headsman’s axe, he dares to lift up his\r\n    voice. If perchance your servant who offers up the lists of\r\n    his lands and men to the Emperor should find favour, and his\r\n    petition be graciously accepted, what happiness could equal\r\n    this? He prays that the All-wise and Illustrious will take his\r\n    poor request into consideration. Your servant Sadayasu, in fear\r\n    and awe, bows the head once and again. Fainting and dying, he\r\n    lifts his voice.”\r\n\r\nThe _Kiōto Gazette_, which gave to the world these memorials, cast much\r\nin the same shape as that hoary old journalistic curiosity the _Peking\r\nGazette_, was one of the first-fruits of the new order of things. It\r\nwas a most interesting publication, full of odds and ends of quaint\r\ninformation, and for some months, when our withers were unwrung by any\r\nrousing excitement, I used to amuse myself by picking plums out of it and\r\ntranslating them for the benefit of the Legation. The memorials by the\r\ngreat nobles surrendering their fiefs, of which I have given specimens\r\nabove, were published in the _Gazette_. I suspect that many of the\r\nannouncements would excite as much curiosity among the Japanese of to-day\r\nas they did in 1869 among us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1.) On the first day of the New Year [February the 11th, 1869] the\r\nEmperor worships the Gods of the Four Points of the Compass, and on this\r\noccasion His Majesty in the Court of the Hall called Seiriyo Den does\r\nhomage before the Gods of Heaven and Earth and prays for a prosperous\r\nyear and long life. He also in the same place prays to the tombs of his\r\nancestors. The Court performs _Go Sekkai_ (similar acts of worship).\r\nA proclamation announces to the Princes assembled at Kiōto that these\r\nacts of worship will take place, and on the second day will take place\r\nthe ceremony of the worship of Haku Ba[14] (“the white horse”) by the\r\nCourt. On the third day dancing and singing by the officers of the Court.\r\nThe Princes may be present on these four days at their convenience. On\r\nthe second the Mikado partakes of the food called _Ō-yukago Gozen_. On\r\nthe second cups of wine are presented to the Ministers of State and on\r\nthe third to various officials, and on the latter day the whole of the\r\nDaimios present at Kiōto receive fans from the Emperor.\r\n\r\n(2.) On the fourth day the Ministers of State assemble on the middle and\r\nsecond stages of the Ko-gosho (small hall of audience), and the Hoshō\r\n(Prime Minister) reads out the imperial address—a patriotic document.\r\n\r\n(3.) On the twelfth day there will be Kagura dances in honour of the\r\n_Kami_ (gods of the country), and on the thirteenth day there will be\r\nKagura in honour of the Imperial change of residence to Yedo. Together\r\nwith these dances there will be Shintō services from the night of the\r\ntenth day until the morning of the fourteenth. Persons in mourning,\r\nBuddhist priests and nuns will not attend on these occasions.\r\n\r\nRegulations for the presentation of wedding gifts of a sword and box of\r\ndried fish to the Emperor from the various Princes; the Empress Mother\r\nand the Empress receiving only dried fish.\r\n\r\n(4.) 5th day. The dance called Senshiu Banzai—“a thousand autumns and ten\r\nthousand years.”\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Minister of State, Yokoi Heishirō, on his return from\r\nCourt. The Emperor addresses him a letter of inquiry. (He had been killed\r\non the spot and his head carried off by the murderers, so it was a\r\npost-mortem compliment.)\r\n\r\n(5.) 7th day. The ceremonies of Haku Ba, “the white horse.” This is a\r\nceremony in honour of spring. Although the Chinese characters for “white\r\nhorse” are used, “Hakuba” should be pronounced “Aoma”—“the black horse.”\r\nIn the book “Kuji Kongen,” the following explanation is given: “If on\r\nthe 7th day of the 1st month, a person should see a black horse it is\r\nsaid that pestilential vapours will not affect him during that year.” The\r\nEmperor Nimmei or Nimmiyo (A.D. 834-850) is said to have seen a black\r\nhorse on that day in the part of the palace called Horaku Den, “the hall\r\nof abundance and happiness.”\r\n\r\nIn the book called “Yo No Kotozawa Mondō,” a collection of saws and\r\nproverbs, the Li Chi is cited, where it is written that persons leading\r\nseven black horses should go out to welcome the coming spring on an\r\neastern moor. _Aoi_, light green, is the colour of spring and _aoi_ is\r\nalso used for the colour of a black horse. The ceremony is therefore the\r\nhailing of spring.\r\n\r\nVarious appointments and reliefs from duty.\r\n\r\n(6.) On the 17th it is announced that on the 19th the Emperor will\r\nwitness dancing. Officials from the fourth rank down to the Hanji and\r\nShiji may be spectators; they will take their places in the corridor, and\r\nmoney will be given to them wherewith they may purchase crane’s flesh and\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—These curious religious dances, which remind one of the dances\r\nof the choristers at Easter in the Cathedral of Seville, are of great\r\nantiquity. It is written in the Nihon-ki, the history of Japan, that\r\nwhen the Emperor Inkiyō died in the forty-second year of his reign\r\n(A.D. 453) the King of Corea, being shocked and grieved at the news,\r\nsent eighty boat-loads of presents with musicians and eighty musical\r\ninstruments, but the court of Japan was ignorant of their use. In the\r\ntwentieth year of the Emperor Suiki (A.D. 612) Uimashi, Kichiuto and\r\nKatai came to Japan from Hiyakusai in Corea, announcing that having\r\nstudied in China, they had learned various accomplishments together\r\nwith the art of dancing, and specially the dances called Mai, a kind of\r\nminuet which the Chinese call Wu, danced to the accompaniment of musical\r\ninstruments. These three men were sent to a place called Sakurai Mura,\r\nand persons of tender age were gathered together to be taught by them.\r\n\r\nTwo years later (A.D. 614) in the twenty-second year of the same reign,\r\none Inugami Mitasuki was sent to the Court of China to be instructed in\r\nvarious accomplishments and returned in the following year. In the reign\r\nof the Emperor Nimmei (A.D. 834-850) Fujiwara no Sadatoshi went to China\r\nfor the same purpose and in A.D. 847 was appointed Uta no Kami, “the Lord\r\nof Song,” as the chief instructor in the arts of singing and dancing. In\r\nthe reign of the same Emperor Nimmei it is recorded that an old man named\r\nHamamushi of the province of Owari, who at eighty-three years of age was\r\nas active as a boy, was summoned to dance before the Emperor. He it was\r\nwho invented the dance called Choju-gaku, the dance of long life. (The\r\nlegend taken from the first eclipse of the sun, when the sun-goddess hid\r\nin a cave and was tempted out by the dancing of her turbulent brother, is\r\ntoo well known to be more than referred to here. But it is the foundation\r\nof the mystic dances of the Shintō.)\r\n\r\n(7.) 18th day. Matsudaira Idzumi no Kami is reproved on account of riots\r\nwhich have taken place in his district.\r\n\r\nOn the same day is issued a proclamation summoning the nobles of high and\r\nlower degree to Yedo. It goes on to say, “The Emperor is grateful for the\r\nfatigues and expenses of various natures which men have endured since\r\nlast spring for their country’s sake. But the summoning of this assembly\r\nis connected with matters of the highest importance to the country.\r\nTherefore let every man receive the Imperial will and obey it with as\r\nlittle pomp and useless expense as possible.”\r\n\r\nRules for the division of duties.\r\n\r\nRules for the offices of the Council and Government—(an excerpt or two\r\nfrom these may be of interest). Office hours are from 10 a.m. till 2 p.m.\r\nexcept when stress of work delays the closing hour.... In all discussions\r\nthe office of the Jingi (Gods of Heaven and Earth—Shintō) will take\r\nprecedence. Other departments will follow in due order and without\r\nconfusion ... at twelve o’clock officers will retire for their midday\r\nmeal. Private conversation and gossiping is forbidden.\r\n\r\nHigh prices having been paid for condemned and worthless vessels, a\r\nregulation is issued forbidding the purchase of ships and men-of-war\r\ndirectly from foreigners without previous survey and permission of\r\nauthorities of the open ports.\r\n\r\n(8.) 19th day. Dancing before the Emperor.\r\n\r\n(9.) 20th day. Priests and officials of the Shintō shrines summoned to\r\ncourt to congratulate the Emperor and pay their respects.\r\n\r\nArrangements for lectures to be delivered before the Emperor on Japanese\r\nand Chinese subjects.\r\n\r\nAnnouncement of conclusion of treaties with Sweden and Norway, two\r\ncountries ruled by one king, and Spain.\r\n\r\n(10.) 22nd day. The Empress Mother will take up her abode in a new\r\nresidence on the 11th of next month at ten in the morning.\r\n\r\nSentences on the men connected with the murder of the two sailors of\r\nH.M.S. _Icarus_.\r\n\r\n(11.) Proclamation to various clans dealing with requests for permission\r\nto become Inkiyō, and petitions affecting the succession to estates and\r\nthe adoption of children.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Adoption is considered as in all respects the same as right of\r\nbirth. A gentleman once told me that he had an unbroken pedigree of a\r\nthousand years—“With adoption at various times?” I asked. “Certainly,”\r\nwas the answer. He was amazed when I told him that in my country there\r\nwere such pedigrees without adoption.\r\n\r\nMemorial of Chōshiu, Satsuma, Hizen and Tosa resigning their fiefs\r\n(translation given above).\r\n\r\n(12.) 25th day. List of persons to whom the oath of allegiance has been\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nOrder for visit of congratulation to the Emperor, Empress and Empress\r\nMother on the occasion of her removal to her new Palace. Persons in\r\nmourning to attend for the purpose on the following day.\r\n\r\n30th day. The Prince of Chōshiu has heard that the Emperor is about\r\nto send an envoy to his country and begs to decline the honour.\r\nAnswer.—“This petition has been taken cognizance of by the Emperor, who\r\nhas urgent reasons for issuing the orders in question, which will not be\r\nrevoked.”\r\n\r\n(13.) 2nd day, 2nd month. Proclamation forbidding the Princes and Nobles\r\nto have excessive retinues—also forbidding their retainers to cry out to\r\nthe people to prostrate themselves as they pass.\r\n\r\n3rd day. Canonization of an ancestor of the Prince of Chōshiu who lived\r\nin the sixteenth century. To the Mori Saisho—father and son:\r\n\r\n“Whereas your ancestor Oyé Motonari, who received posthumous honours of\r\nthe third rank during a period when the three duties of Prince, Father\r\nand Husband, and the five virtues of Benevolence, Justice, Decorum,\r\nKnowledge and Truth, were thrown into confusion, was the only man who set\r\na brilliant example of loyalty and virtue; whereas he slew and expelled\r\nthe wicked and the rebel, and whereas he over and over again offered up\r\ntribute to relieve the Emperor in his need; such patriotism and loyalty\r\nat this distance of time excites deep admiration in the Emperor, who\r\ndirects that he be canonized as a _Kami_ (Shintō god) and orders that his\r\nworship shall endure for all generations.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor commands that his shrine be called the Shrine of Toyosaka.”\r\n\r\nOrder for the circulation of a book of religious instruction called\r\n“Kiōto Fu Koku Yu Dai I.” As Sir Harry Parkes in forwarding my\r\ntranslation to the Foreign Office said, “An interesting instance is thus\r\nfurnished of the endeavours of the Mikado’s Government to educate the\r\nmind of the nation on the political questions of the day. The intimate\r\nconnection of religion with politics in a country in which the Emperor\r\nis regarded as the Vicegerent of Heaven upon earth is, of course,\r\nobvious.” A paper translated by Mr. von Siebold contains the following\r\nexpressions: “The Government and religion of a country are closely\r\nunited.... The law of the Mikado and the religion were in ancient days\r\ncalled _the wings of a bird or the wheels of a cart_. This old saying is\r\nvery correct.”\r\n\r\nThe treatise is so curious and so instructive as a human document that I\r\nadd my translation of it in an appendix.\r\n\r\nAlthough the printing of pirated editions of other books is strictly\r\nforbidden an exception is made in the matter of the reproduction of this\r\npamphlet.\r\n\r\nOrder that taxes be paid in bank notes (_kinsatsu_) at the rate of 120\r\nriyos paper for every 100 riyos specie.\r\n\r\nOther orders relating to paper money.\r\n\r\nOrder for the establishment of a mint and new coinage.\r\n\r\n(14.) 9th day. Appointment of a lady-in-waiting[15] and a _naishi_\r\n(waiting-woman of lesser rank).\r\n\r\n(15.) 12th day. Five villages in the province of Echizen are to\r\nmanufacture paper for bank notes. The paper is called Hoshō Gami.\r\n\r\n(16.) 13th day. A loan of half a million riyos is asked for by the Prince\r\nof Kubota, who, being the only noble in Ōshiu and Dewa who remained\r\nfaithful to the Emperor during the war, suffered grievous losses. A loan\r\nof 200,000 riyos authorized, the Government being sorely straitened for\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n(17.) The various districts and cities are ordered to send in returns\r\nof their average revenues for the last five years—also returns of the\r\nincomes of petty nobles and principal officials, and of the Shintō\r\nshrines and Buddhist temples within their jurisdiction. The petty nobles\r\nand officers are warned to send in returns to facilitate the above.\r\nSimilar orders are sent in to the clans in respect of taxes and customs\r\nlevied in their territories during the last five years, and also in\r\nrespect of revenues of shrines and temples.\r\n\r\n(18.) 17th day. Two gentlemen, Kuabari Taifu and Funabashi Jijiu Sammi,\r\nare reproved for not studying, and by their idleness disgracing their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen are ordered to proceed to Kiōto in order to practise\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial journey from Kiōto to Yedo is fixed for the 7th of next\r\nmonth. Stern orders are issued to prevent any harsh treatment of the\r\npeople by members of the suite or their servants. In the latter case the\r\nmasters will be held responsible.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The issue of this order shows that there was great truth in the\r\nstories we used to hear of bullying and terrorizing by the retinues of\r\nDaimios and nobles on their journeys to and from Yedo.\r\n\r\nThe priest Embun of the Temple Niakuōji has been ordered to unfrock\r\nhimself and enter the army as a cadet of the family of Namashina. Having\r\nthus been created a noble of the Court (_Kugé_) he will receive an income\r\nof forty-eight _kokus_ (about £100 at the then price of rice).\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor goes to worship at Isé (where are the shrines of the God\r\nAncestors) members of the retinue will stop at the post town of Seki and\r\nrejoin the procession at the post town of Isu, after the acts of worship\r\nshall have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nDistribution of troops of the various clans. The Prince of Kaga to send\r\nhis contribution of rice for the army to the War Office at Yedo.\r\n\r\nAn edict forbidding the _rusui_, or agents in charge of Daimios’\r\n_yashikis_, to continue the practice of spending money on theatrical\r\nentertainments, singing parties, exhibitions of wrestlers and debauchery.\r\n\r\nAn edict which says that whereas the various clans have been in the\r\nhabit of negotiating loans directly with foreigners in violation of all\r\npropriety, it is now ordered that henceforth clans wishing to borrow\r\nmoney from foreigners shall address a petition to the Foreign Office,\r\nwhich will grant or refuse its consent.\r\n\r\nAn edict regulating the opening of mines, for testing the purity of gold,\r\nsilver and copper, and for preventing the robbery of the peasants who\r\nwork the mines by evilly-disposed persons.\r\n\r\nRegulations for the employment of foreigners only with the consent of the\r\nForeign Office.\r\n\r\n(19.) 25th day. To the Princes of the Blood, _Kugés_ and Princes.\r\n“The first day of next month having been fixed for the ceremony of\r\nshaving off the eyebrows of the Empress, you are ordered to offer your\r\ncongratulations at the palace of the Empress Dowager and of the Empress.\r\nIt is not necessary to present offerings. Persons in mourning will attend\r\non the following day.”\r\n\r\nSimilar orders are issued to officers of the fifth rank and upwards.\r\nRules prescribed as to dresses of ceremony (_Ikan_ and _Shitataré_).\r\n\r\nOrders as to the Emperor’s journey. Visits of congratulation to be paid\r\nby Princes of the Blood, etc., at the palaces of the Empress Dowager and\r\nEmpress. “During the fifteen days following the Imperial departure each\r\nof you will proceed once to the Palace to inquire after the Emperor’s\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\nThe 28th instant having been fixed for the revival of the ancient\r\nceremony of praying for a prosperous year, the Emperor will be engaged in\r\nprayer, and religious exercises will be continued from the evening of the\r\n26th until the morning of the 29th. Persons in deep or slight mourning,\r\nBuddhist priests and nuns should avoid going to Court on those days.\r\n\r\nAppointments of Boards of Trade at open ports; new purchases and orders\r\nnot to be entered upon until old obligations shall have been settled.\r\n\r\n(20.) 24th day. Regulation of prices of horses and coolies during the\r\ncongestion of traffic caused by removal of the Court to Yedo.\r\n\r\n(21.) 25th day. An order for framing rules and regulations for the House\r\nof Parliament, for which accommodation will be found in the Castle.\r\n\r\nDespatch of a mission to Koyasan.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—A mountain in Kishiu where there is a temple founded by Kōbō\r\nDaishi, and other temples. Koyasan is the home of the Koya Maki\r\n(_Sciadopitys verticillata_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese few extracts from the earliest numbers of the _Kiōto Gazette_ seem\r\nto me to have a certain interest as showing the great variety of affairs\r\nwith which the newly-established Government had to busy itself. Some were\r\nsmall, others important: the _Dai-jōkwan_ (the new Government) had to\r\nimitate the elephant’s trunk—pick up a pin or uproot a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “GI-JI-IN,” OR PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that the British House of Commons is the mother of\r\nparliaments. The new House of Representatives at Yedo was its youngest\r\nbabe. Like those of all other babes, its first footsteps were somewhat\r\ntottery and uncertain. It had to learn to walk before it could run. The\r\nfirst debates did not reveal much oratorical power or even promise of\r\npower; oratory was, as I think I have said before, not one of the natural\r\ngifts of the nation; but the subjects of discussion were interesting and\r\nthe arguments used by the speakers very instructive to all students of\r\nthe country’s idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Parliament was opened on the 18th of April, 1869, under\r\nthe Presidency of Prince Akidzuki. The Emperor’s message to the House—a\r\nmaiden effort—was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Being on the point of visiting our eastern capital, we have convened the\r\nnobles of our Court, and the various Princes, in order to consult them\r\nupon the means of establishing the foundations of peaceful government.\r\nLaws and institutions are the basis of government. The petitions of the\r\npeople at large cannot be lightly decided. It has been reported to us\r\nthat brief rules and regulations have been fixed upon for the Parliament,\r\nand it seems good to us that the House should be opened at once.\r\n\r\n“We expect you to respect the laws of the House, to lay aside all private\r\nand selfish considerations, to conduct your debates with minuteness\r\nand firmness; above all things, to take the laws of our ancestors as a\r\nbasis. Adapt yourselves to the feelings of men and to the spirit of the\r\ntimes. Distinguish clearly between those matters which are of immediate\r\nimportance and those which may be delayed; between things which are less\r\nurgent and those which are pressing. In your several capacities argue\r\nwith careful attention. When the results of your debates are communicated\r\nto us it shall be our duty to confirm them.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this Imperial message contains, especially in\r\nthe last sentence, something more than a promise of constitutional\r\ngovernment, while reference to the spirit of the times is all the more\r\nremarkable considering the source from which it comes.\r\n\r\nThe first subject of debate was upon the position of the cadet branches\r\nof the great princely houses. It was proposed that in the event of the\r\nheads of such cadet branches being attainted of treason or crime, their\r\nproperties should return to the elder branch and the guilty person alone\r\nbe rendered responsible. If the property of an attainted cadet branch\r\nwere held of the Crown, and not of the elder branch, then the property\r\nshould revert to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the Parliament was followed by the production of\r\na newspaper called the _Kogishō Nisshi_ or “Journal of Parliament.”\r\nIt shows that, however crude and elementary the debates might be, the\r\ninstitution gave opportunities such as had never existed before of\r\nventilating important subjects and publishing the discussions for the\r\ninstruction of the people. It also gave the Government the chance of\r\nissuing from time to time papers of questions, the object of which was\r\nthe political education of the members themselves. One of these papers\r\nwas so remarkable that I have no hesitation in giving my translation of\r\nit here _in extenso_.\r\n\r\n(Blue Book, Japan, No. 3. 1870.)\r\n\r\n    (Translation.) Seventeen subjects of inquiry as to the means\r\n    of washing away the Shame of Our Country in regard to foreign\r\n    relations.\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDUM ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS OF JAPAN, DRAWN UP BY THE\r\n    FOREIGN OFFICE.\r\n\r\n    (1.) From ancient times till the present day the question of\r\n    opening or closing the country has been a frequent theme of\r\n    debate. Are the barbarians birds or beasts with whom we ought\r\n    not to associate?—or, seeing that our country is not really\r\n    rich and strong, should we take of their surplus to supply our\r\n    deficiencies and then sweep them away? Or shall we change our\r\n    teaching altogether to the Western fashion, opening schools\r\n    for the acquisition of Western accomplishments and mastering\r\n    the arts of gunnery and of shipbuilding, and when we have done\r\n    this, drive them utterly from the country? Or shall we cut the\r\n    barbarians down? All sorts of schemes of this nature have been\r\n    debated down to the present day. If Japan is to be opened,\r\n    shall we keep our foreign relations as they at present exist,\r\n    or shall we place them upon a new and different footing?\r\n\r\n    (2.) If it be determined that Japan should be closed, ought the\r\n    foreigners to be expelled with decision, or shall we cut down\r\n    and slay the foreigners who are living here? And when they come\r\n    to fight us (in revenge for this) what will be the proper way\r\n    for us to meet them?\r\n\r\n    (3.) If, when the foreigners come with their armies to invade\r\n    us we having no soldiers ready to oppose them, our people and\r\n    the Emperor’s house fall together to rise no more, what then?\r\n\r\n    (4.) If, when the time comes for us to struggle with the\r\n    foreigners, there should be persons to raise the extraordinary\r\n    argument that we ought not to pit our soldiers and our strength\r\n    against them, how shall we be justified in holding such\r\n    language?\r\n\r\n    (5.) If it be decided to close the ports, when the time\r\n    comes for us to fight, in what province shall we place our\r\n    illustrious Imperial House in safety, and how shall we protect\r\n    it? What will be the result of our precautions?\r\n\r\n    (6.) If at the present time there are men who violently\r\n    murder innocent foreigners, or who coin base money, or who\r\n    borrow excessive sums of money, yearly and monthly piling up\r\n    iniquity upon iniquity, when the foreigners shall have taken\r\n    counsel together, and set their forces in motion to attack\r\n    our Government and demand reparation, they will appropriate\r\n    the open ports, stop our shipping upon the seas, and take\r\n    possession of our islands, and then how shall we ward them off;\r\n    what device shall we invent to suppress them?\r\n\r\n    (7.) It appears that at the present moment the party in favour\r\n    of opening the ports are the advocates of Western civilization,\r\n    while the party in favour of closing the ports advocate the\r\n    Japanese and Chinese civilization. If one or the other policy\r\n    is to be adopted once for all, which of these two will it be\r\n    fitting that we should determine and fix upon?\r\n\r\n    (8.) At a juncture like the present how will it answer in the\r\n    end to make our Shintō religion the religion practised in truth\r\n    and in fact by the whole people of Japan?\r\n\r\n    (9.) When the policy to be pursued is adopted, will that of\r\n    opening or that of closing the country be best adapted to the\r\n    spirit of the times, and on which side will the advantage or\r\n    disadvantage, the gain or loss, show themselves in the end?\r\n\r\n    (10.) The object of the treaties between Japan and other\r\n    countries was to promote friendship and commerce between our\r\n    people and foreigners. For the last few years foreign countries\r\n    have vied with one another in sending their fleets and soldiers\r\n    to reside in Japan for the protection of their people. Should\r\n    any trouble arise, they will send out their troops in a\r\n    moment to protect the different places at which they reside.\r\n    At the present moment there are some three thousand British\r\n    troops here. The next in numbers to these are the French. The\r\n    Americans and other countries have only their fleets. As yet\r\n    our illustrious and divine country has not been brought into\r\n    contempt before the foreigner; the present danger is lest we\r\n    should call upon ourselves that contempt. What is the proper\r\n    line of conduct for us at present to adopt in order to clear\r\n    away that danger?\r\n\r\n    (11.) Reflecting upon this introduction of troops in accordance\r\n    with the principles of international law, it is unheard of that\r\n    soldiers should be stationed in any other places than colonies\r\n    of the mother-country. During the last few years several\r\n    tens of foreign merchants have been murdered, and for every\r\n    man so murdered the foreign Governments have increased their\r\n    forces until they have reached their present large numbers.\r\n    As these murders increase they will, in the same proportion,\r\n    add to their troops and fortify themselves more and more. What\r\n    measures shall we adopt to put a stop to this?\r\n\r\n    (12.) If, as the years and months roll on, foreigners continue\r\n    to be murdered, and in this way foreign forces are augmented\r\n    until all the ports are filled by them, this will be the\r\n    greatest pollution and disgrace that could befall our divine\r\n    country. As it is, we bear an evil name before the nations of\r\n    the world. Animated by the patriotic spirit of Samurais of\r\n    Japan, how shall we wipe out the blot of these misdeeds in\r\n    sight of the world?\r\n\r\n    (13.) The presence of these foreign troops points to the\r\n    impotence of our Government to preserve peace and to protect\r\n    native and foreigner. It is proclaimed that, until the power\r\n    of life and death, of giving and of taking away, belongs to\r\n    the Government,[16] the troops cannot be sent back to their\r\n    respective countries. This power of life and death, of giving\r\n    and of taking away, is the prerogative of the Government.\r\n    The preservation of peace and the protection of native and\r\n    foreigner is the very essence of that which is right and\r\n    proper. The principle of mutual relief and assistance is that\r\n    upon which treaties of amity should be observed. At the present\r\n    moment we have come to such a point that we are tutored by\r\n    foreign countries as to our own internal policy. What good\r\n    scheme shall we adopt to blot out this shame?\r\n\r\n    (14.) In the days of the Shōgun’s government the power of life\r\n    and of death, the power of dismissal from and nomination to\r\n    office was in the hands of low persons.[17] This caused the\r\n    restoration of the government to the Emperor. How shall we\r\n    guide our chariot clear of the rut in which that which preceded\r\n    it was overturned?\r\n\r\n    (15.) The representatives of foreign Powers when they go\r\n    through the streets or in the country are preceded and followed\r\n    by soldiers; what means shall we adopt to put an end to this\r\n    irregularity? or shall we take no steps to put a stop to it?\r\n\r\n    (16.) It has happened that when the officers or soldiers of the\r\n    cities, clans and district towns fall in with foreigners on\r\n    the high road, disturbances have occurred; what means shall be\r\n    adopted to punish such offences? or, indeed, has the Government\r\n    the power to punish them?[18] When foreigners ask these\r\n    questions how can we give them a true and faithful answer?\r\n\r\n    (17.) If it be desired to decide clearly between peace and\r\n    war, an earnest and determined effort is necessary in either\r\n    case. If our energies are relaxed for one single step we shall\r\n    suddenly be precipitated into the misfortunes consequent upon\r\n    our want of decision, and the power of the Government will fall\r\n    into the hands of unprincipled persons. Therefore, is it not\r\n    desirable that the question of peace or war should be decided\r\n    once for all?\r\n\r\n    The above questions are of all importance at the present\r\n    moment. They must be treated with honesty and sincerity, and\r\n    we earnestly beg you to settle these subjects, conducting your\r\n    deliberations in accordance with the spirit of the times.\r\n\r\n                                            (Signed) FOREIGN OFFICE.\r\n\r\nI translated several of the debates of the young Parliament; they were on\r\nvarious subjects. Here are one or two of the headings:\r\n\r\n(1.) The confiscated estates of cadet branches of noble families\r\nattainted of treason—shall they be forfeit to the crown or shall they be\r\ngiven to the elder branch?\r\n\r\n(2.) In cases of urgent necessity it has hitherto been the custom to\r\nextort large levies of money from farmers and rich merchants. One Ono\r\nSeigorō proposes to substitute for this method of raising money, which\r\nhe stigmatizes as little better than robbery, a national debt on the\r\nEuropean model; and that the Government should borrow money from the\r\npeople on the security of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 3 or 3½\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe voting upon this measure was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Ayes                                    123\r\n    Noes                                     30\r\n    For the abolition of levies,\r\n      but against the National Debt          32\r\n    Against the abolition of levies,\r\n      but for the National Debt               2\r\n                                            ---\r\n                                            187\r\n\r\n(3.) On reckoning distances, temple lands and villages occupied by Etas\r\n(the pariah class) have not been taken into account, because these have\r\nnot been required to furnish coolie labour to the Government. This has\r\nled to confusion—and it is proposed to rectify the error.\r\n\r\n    Ayes              172\r\n    Noes                7\r\n    Indifferent        13\r\n                      ---\r\n                      192\r\n\r\n(4.) A proposal to abolish the practice of bearing familiar names. Also\r\nthat titles be abolished, and great and small known only by their proper\r\npersonal names. Question not decided.\r\n\r\n(5.) A motion for introducing into the public service competitive\r\nexaminations upon the Chinese principle.\r\n\r\nThe sixth debate was upon the question of establishing partnerships\r\nbetween Japanese and foreigners; and here the new institution was upon\r\ndangerous ground—the more so in that some of the honourable members spoke\r\nof “foreign barbarians.” The foreign representatives felt bound to warn\r\nthe Government that whatever the House might please to say the treaties\r\nmust be respected and foreigners spoken of with courtesy. The Government\r\nwere not slow in apologizing.\r\n\r\nTwo of the debates were extremely interesting; they were translated by\r\nMr. Aston; the subject of the one being prohibition of _seppuku_ (the\r\nclassical word for _hara-kiri_) and the other a motion that it should\r\nbe optional for the Samurai to wear sword and dirk. As may be imagined,\r\nthese proposals met with scant favour. _Seppuku_, it must be remembered,\r\nwas a punishment, the highly prized privilege of the Samurai, the\r\narmiger, or gentleman, of Japan. It saved him from the disgrace of dying\r\nby the sword of the executioner, and it preserved his property, which\r\nwould otherwise have been forfeited, for the benefit of his family. As a\r\nvoluntary act it is not yet extinct. The death of my friend the heroic\r\nGeneral Nogi, the hero of Port Arthur, bears testimony to that. Some of\r\nthe arguments used by the speakers were full of character; one member\r\ndefined _seppuku_ as “the very shrine of the Yamato Damashii, the spirit\r\nof old Japan, and the embodiment in practice of devotion to principle.”\r\n\r\nAnother said: “To prohibit it would be to remove one of the pillars of\r\nthe Constitution.” One patriot declared that “It is an ornament to our\r\ncountry, and is one reason of its superiority over the countries beyond\r\nthe seas.” “We ought to maintain a custom which fosters a sense of shame\r\nin the military caste and in the existence of which doubtless consists\r\nthe superiority of Japan over other countries.” “Why should this custom\r\nbe prohibited in imitation of the effeminacy of foreign nations?” “In\r\nthis Country of the Gods it is not necessary to discuss such a law.”\r\nAgain, “The _seppuku_ has its origin in the vital energy of this divine\r\ncountry and is the shrine of the Yamato Damashii. Its practice should be\r\nextended.” “The reason why _seppuku_ is practised in this Empire and not\r\nin foreign countries is because this Empire is an Empire.” It would be\r\ntedious to multiply instances of utterances of this class. They show the\r\nstill prevalent belief in the divine superiority of the speakers’ country\r\nand the deeply-rooted veneration for what in their eyes was an act of\r\nheroism when voluntary, of privilege when enforced. When the question was\r\nput to the vote only three men voted for abolition; two hundred against;\r\nno vote, six. Of what were looked upon as the recreant three, one man was\r\nsaid—with what truth I know not, but it was widely believed—to have been\r\nmurdered shortly afterwards as the reward of his vote.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the question of making it optional to wear two swords\r\nthere was even less discussion. The proposal was negatived unanimously.\r\nHere, again, some of the speeches were instructive.\r\n\r\nOne gentleman, Sonoda Tamatsu, said: “It is a good maxim for the soldier\r\nin peace time never to forget war. What shall we say of a measure that\r\nasks us, even in the midst of civil disorder, to forget the existence of\r\ncivil disorder? What, I ask, is the character of the times in which we\r\nlive? The object of the soldier caste wearing two swords is that they may\r\nsuppress war by war; but as the chief glory of the sword consists in its\r\nresting quietly in its sheath, it follows that a natural stimulus is\r\ngiven to letters,” etc.\r\n\r\nSo the motion was lost, but a year or two later the Government, finding\r\nit impossible to check the old broils and troubles which became so\r\ndangerous when hot-headed men were armed with deadly weapons, passed\r\na law making the wearing of swords illegal. The famous old saying of\r\nIyéyasu, “The girded sword is the living soul of the Samurai,” has become\r\na dead letter. The sword is laid upon the sword-rack on the _tokonoma_\r\n(raised dais), an heirloom and object of reverence, but the Japanese\r\ngentleman goes forth unarmed, and there is peace in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nJAPAN. THE RECEPTION OF THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great stir in Japan in the summer of 1869, when it was known\r\nthat the Duke of Edinburgh was coming in the _Galatea_. The Japanese\r\nGovernment were wildly excited, for it was the first time that a Royal\r\nPrince had paid a visit to the Mikado, and they were determined to give\r\nhis Royal Highness a reception at Yedo worthy of his rank and of the\r\nMonarch who was to entertain him. Hama-go-ten, a beautiful garden by the\r\nsea, was determined upon as his residence; and the preparations were\r\nmade in the most generous fashion. Furniture and all the equipments\r\nnecessary to European ideas of comfort were procured from Hong Kong; but\r\nthe decorations were carried out entirely in the native fashion, and most\r\nbeautiful and artistic they were.\r\n\r\nIn order that nothing might be wanting the Japanese asked Sir Harry\r\nto allow me to help them, for in those times they were not so well\r\nacquainted with Western habits as they are now; so a couple of rooms were\r\nmade ready for me in Hama-go-ten so that I might be on the spot, and\r\nthere I remained for about a month. I was also to serve as interpreter to\r\nthe Duke, and as I should have to act on the occasion of his interview\r\nwith the Son of Heaven, I had to be coached in the language of “the\r\npeople above the clouds” (royalties and courtiers), for there are matters\r\nof etiquette and proper phraseology at this as at all courts in which it\r\nwould be very easy to make some awkward mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity that the Japanese did not have the inspiration to lodge\r\nthe Duke in one of their own charming pavilions; but they were bent upon\r\npreparing a European house for him, and so a rather ugly, ramshackle\r\nwooden house with green shutters was run up in a hurry. The ugliness of\r\nthe outside, however, was made up for by the decorations within. The\r\nwalls were a perfect riot of colour and gold, which in less deft hands\r\nwould have been glaring and violent, but the artists had the secret of\r\nso mastering and intermarrying the most hostile colours that the whole\r\neffect was delightful and a succession of surprises. The discordant note\r\nwas struck by the furniture dealers of Hong Kong; their wares, with a\r\nstrong flavour of Tottenham Court Road in them, jarred piteously with the\r\nimaginative poetry of the Japanese artists.\r\n\r\nThe Duke arrived in the harbour of Yokohama on the 31st of August, and,\r\nafter the usual salutes, levées, addresses and all the other wearinesses\r\nof which loyalty is capable, drove up to Yedo, along the picturesque\r\nTokaido, in one of the Emperor’s carriages. Mr. Eliot Yorke, Captain\r\nHaig, Mr. Ramsay (afterwards Lord Dalhousie) and Lord Charles Beresford\r\nwere those who accompanied him from the _Galatea_. I was specially\r\nattached to him during his stay, and of course Sir Harry Parkes went\r\nwith him. All along the road he was received with the same honours\r\nthat would be paid to the Mikado himself. The shutters of the upstairs\r\nrooms in the houses by the wayside were hermetically sealed with bits\r\nof paper stuck across them so that no Peeping Tom should look down upon\r\nthe august person—a custom long since passed away in these days, when\r\nthe Emperor shows himself as freely as any European sovereign. As the\r\nDuke’s carriage went by, the people who thronged the road and streets\r\nfell prostrate, touching the earth with their foreheads. A most elaborate\r\nprogramme had been drawn up for his Royal Highness’ arrival. I extract\r\nfrom my translation of it one or two items which savour of the old-world\r\nceremonial of the court, now quite forgotten. The rest deal with salutes,\r\nrefreshments, etc.\r\n\r\n“Previous to his Royal Highness’ arrival in Japan, prayers will be\r\noffered up to Kanjin for his prosperous voyage.” Kanjin, literally the\r\nGod of China. This is the revival of an extremely ancient ceremonial\r\nwhich dates from a time when there was no intercourse with abroad,\r\nexcepting with China through Corea. Kanjin is therefore the patron saint\r\nof foreigners, who are all united under his protection under the generic\r\nname of Tōjin, or “men of the Tang” dynasty of China.\r\n\r\n“On the day before his Royal Highness’ departure for his residence at\r\nYedo, the roads will be cleaned and repaired; and prayers for his safe\r\njourney will be offered up to the God of Roads.”\r\n\r\n“On the day on which his Royal Highness may be expected to arrive in\r\nYedo, religious ceremonies will take place at Shinagawa [the suburb\r\nthrough which he would pass] to exorcize all evil spirits. On his Royal\r\nHighness’ arrival, a Prince of the Blood will visit him, to inquire after\r\nhis health.”\r\n\r\n“When his Royal Highness is about to enter the gate of the castle the\r\nceremony called Nusa will take place.”\r\n\r\nNusa is a sweeping away of evil influences with a sort of flapper with a\r\nhempen tassel.\r\n\r\nThe prayers and pious orisons of the Shintō priests were heard; the\r\nDuke arrived and departed in unbroken health and spirits; all evil\r\ninfluences, all malignant _oni_ and _bakémono_ (devils and ghosts) had\r\nbeen successfully exorcized. When I read my old notes of all these things\r\nI seem to be looking across a long vista of forgotten centuries into the\r\ngloom of prehistoric times; I am transported back into the days when the\r\nGod Hachiman decided the fates of battles, when Inari Sama and his foxes\r\nruled the harvest, and Benten was the supreme Queen Goddess of beauty.\r\n\r\nPlaygoing in the old days, before the restoration in 1868, was entirely\r\nconfined to the lower classes; no gentleman could afford to be seen\r\nin a public theatre; in private, it is true that famous actors would\r\noccasionally be hired to give a representation at the _yashiki_ of\r\nsome rich noble, to whom the ordinary performance would be forbidden.\r\nThere were, however, certain classical dances and plays which were\r\nspecially performed in theatres attached to the palaces. The _bugaku_,\r\nfor instance, were dances or pantomime plays the performance of which\r\nwas confined to the Emperor’s palace, so that very few Japanese, and\r\nthose only of the highest rank, ever witnessed them.[19] The Nō, on the\r\nother hand, were a kind of classical opera performed on stages called\r\n_nō butai_, which were attached to the _yashiki_ of some of the great\r\nnobles. These operas—I know no better name for them—are of the greatest\r\nantiquity. They are supposed to recall the performances by which the\r\nSun Goddess was lured out of the cave in which she had hidden in order\r\nto escape from the persecutions of her turbulent brother—a legend which\r\nis supposed to have been the poetic explanation of the first eclipse.\r\nThey had, moreover, a religious intention in the first instance, having\r\nbeen arranged at the Emperor’s command by one Hada Rawakatsu in the\r\nlast decade of the sixth century. A special performance of Nō was given\r\nin honour of the Duke of Edinburgh in the _yashiki_ of the Prince of\r\nKishiu—which had the reputation of being, after the Castle, the most\r\nluxurious palace in Yedo.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that such a performance was witnessed by\r\nforeigners. Opposite the principal reception room, where his Royal\r\nHighness sat, and separated from it by a narrow courtyard, was a covered\r\nstage, approached from the green-room by a long gallery at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees. Half a dozen musicians, robed in dresses of ceremony,\r\nmarched slowly down the gallery—something like the entrance of the\r\nactors in _Sumurun_, as arranged by Reinhardt—and having squatted down\r\non the stage, gravely made obeisance. The performances then began. There\r\nwas no scenery, no stage appliances; the descriptions of the chorus or\r\nthe actors took their place. The dialogue and choruses were given in a\r\nnasal recitative, accompanied by the mouth-organ, flute, drum and other\r\nclassical instruments. The ancient poetry of these pieces is full of the\r\nmost delicate fancies obscured by archaic puns and plays upon words; so\r\nit was with no little difficulty that, with the assistance of a man of\r\nletters, I prepared the arguments of the plays.\r\n\r\nI published these long years ago,[20] so there is no need to repeat them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nDuring the Duke’s stay there were entertainments of all sorts, for the\r\nJapanese were determined that he should carry away the happiest memories\r\nof his visit. The most famous of the fat wrestlers of Japan, monstrous\r\nmountains of adipose tissue, gave a show and there were dancers,\r\nmusicians, conjurors; Chō-chō San[21] came specially for the butterfly\r\ntrick, which has never been so well described as by Sherard Osborn in\r\nthat long-since-forgotten little gem, “A Cruise in Japanese Waters.”\r\n\r\nAll these were shown in a setting the beauty of which it would be hard\r\nto exaggerate. The garden of Hama-go-ten was a masterpiece of Japanese\r\nhorticulture. I believe that it no longer exists, the land having been\r\nsold for commercial purposes. When the first part was sold I had the luck\r\nto be able to buy two of the great bronze lanterns which decorated it.\r\nHow little I thought when I used to wander through the lovely grounds\r\nduring the weeks which I spent there making ready for the Duke that one\r\nday many years later two of the precious ornaments which I admired so\r\nmuch would find their way to my own home in far-away Gloucestershire!\r\n\r\nThe most interesting episode of the visit was, of course, the reception\r\nby the Emperor at the Castle. The official reception took place in the\r\naudience chamber; his Royal Highness, Sir Harry Parkes, Sir Henry Keppel\r\nand the officers in attendance on the Duke were shown into the room where\r\nthe Mikado stood on a raised dais with two of his personal attendants\r\nand the Prime Minister behind him. The Duke and I took our places on the\r\ndais opposite to the Mikado. It was rather nervous work for me, for it is\r\nso easy to bungle into some absurd mistake where foreign etiquette and a\r\nvery stately phraseology have to be observed; however, it all went off\r\nwell, there were the usual commonplaces exchanged, and then his Majesty\r\ninvited his Royal Highness to meet him more privately in the garden.\r\n\r\nAfter a short delay, during which the Princes and dignitaries of the\r\nCourt came to pay their respects, the Duke was shown into the delicious\r\nlittle Maple Tea-house in the Castle gardens, where tea and all manner of\r\ndelicacies were served. Then came a summons to the Waterfall Pavilion,\r\nwhere the Emperor was waiting; only Sir Harry, the Admiral, and myself\r\nwent in with the Duke. Dull is the office of the Court newsman! Difficult\r\nit is to become artistically enthusiastic over the presentation of\r\ndiamond-mounted snuff-boxes! But this particular Court ceremony was\r\ncertainly something out of the common. It can never occur again. East and\r\nWest were sharply defined. There were no cocked hats or gold-laced coats\r\namong the Japanese of those days. The Emperor and all his Court were\r\nliving pictures out of the dark centuries.\r\n\r\nThe next time that I saw the Mikado was on the occasion of my second\r\nvisit to Japan, in 1873. He was sitting back in a barouche, surrounded\r\nby an escort of lancers, dressed, like himself, in European uniform. A\r\nmodern of the moderns.\r\n\r\nWhen I went for the third time, in 1906, with Prince Arthur of Connaught,\r\nhis Majesty reminded me of that visit in 1869, when I acted as\r\ninterpreter—but he was now surrounded by a Court in which the men were\r\nall the counterparts of European ministers, their breasts covered with\r\nstars and decorations from potentates great and small, and the ladies\r\nall wore tiaras and dresses from Paquin’s! Alas for the vanishing of the\r\nPicturesque!\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government were very grateful for the trouble which I had\r\ntaken to make the Royal visit a success, and when the Duke left the\r\nForeign Ministers sent me a very pretty letter of thanks, with a lacquer\r\nbox, which the English Foreign Office allowed me to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUSTRIAN MISSION\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1869 there came an Austrian Mission to conclude a\r\ntreaty with Japan. As usual we pulled the chestnuts out of the fire\r\nfor them. The Mission was commended to our good offices and we had to\r\ndry-nurse them, put them up to the ropes, and furnish them with an\r\ninterpreter. The head of the Mission was Admiral Petz, the hero of Lissa,\r\na most interesting personality; the second in command, charged with the\r\nnegotiation of the commercial details of the affair, was Baron Calice,\r\nwho afterwards made a sort of name for himself as Austro-Hungarian\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nWith the Admiral I made great friends. One day as we were sitting\r\ntogether watching the picturesque junks sailing to and fro in front of a\r\ngreat warship in the Bay of Yedo, he gave me an account of the battle\r\nof Lissa in which he had played so great a part three years before. The\r\nisland of Lissa, practically an Austrian fortress plunged in the Adriatic\r\nsea, was attacked on the 18th of July, 1866, by the Italian fleet under\r\nAdmiral Persano. The Austrian Admiral Tegethoff went out to relieve the\r\nbesieged stronghold, and on the 20th the great sea-fight took place.\r\nAdmiral Petz’s story of the battle was most exciting. Although ironclads\r\nhad been in existence for some years, Lissa must have been the first\r\naction in which they played their part. The Italian fleet, with eleven\r\narmoured ships and a powerful ram, was by far the stronger; the Austrians\r\nhad only seven. The wooden ships on the two sides were about even in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Petz, then Commodore, was in command of the _Kaiser_, an\r\nold-fashioned wooden battleship. There was a moment when he was engaged\r\nat close quarters with three Italian ironclads, the four ships blazing\r\naway for dear life or death. He was on the bridge, half choked and\r\nblinded by the thick, poisonous smoke and flames belched out by his own\r\nand the enemy’s guns, his ears deafened by the roar of the cannon. It\r\nwas like hell-fire let loose upon the waters. All of a sudden a puff\r\nof wind cleared the air, and to his dismay he saw the huge bulk of the\r\ndreaded _Ré d’Italia_, supposed to be the most powerful armoured vessel\r\nafloat, bearing down upon him. Iron attacking oak; an unequal fight. It\r\nwas a horror: if she rammed him it was certain death for all. A sudden\r\ninspiration struck him; he had just time to make a despairing dash at the\r\nmonster before she could reach him. He gave the necessary order, full\r\nsteam ahead, charged and drove his bows into her, striking her amidships.\r\nTo his amazement the blow crashed into her, boring a huge hole in her\r\niron sides as easily as if they had been made of paper, and the great\r\nterror sank into the sea with all her crew.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians had had the best of it all through the fight, another\r\nironclad, the _Palestro_, had been blown up, the other three, with which\r\nPetz had been engaged, were badly hurt, and now this last disaster broke\r\nthe Italians and sent them in full flight to Ancona. The battle was won!\r\nAdmiral Tegethoff summoned his captains to the flagship, and when they\r\nwere all drawn up on the quarterdeck, he went up to Petz, kissed him on\r\nboth cheeks, and said: “This is your victory!”\r\n\r\nThe _Kaiser_ was naturally very much mauled, but the wooden ship had\r\nscored; she had practically disabled two other ironclads and battered\r\na third before sinking the _Ré d’Italia_, and could carry her wounds\r\nbravely into port.\r\n\r\nLong years afterwards at luncheon at the Travellers’ Club, I was telling\r\nthe story as I had it from Admiral Petz himself. My dear old friend, Lord\r\nAlcester, the famous admiral, who was nothing if not stiff in opinions,\r\nstoutly denied the possibility of a wooden ship in any circumstances\r\nsinking an ironclad; but\r\n\r\n    “Facts are chiels that winna ding\r\n    And downa be disputed,”\r\n\r\nthe _Ré d’Italia_ with her crew of six hundred lies at the bottom of the\r\nAdriatic, the _Kaiser_ came away a cripple covered with glory, and her\r\ngallant Commodore received the Maria-Teresien order—a distinction even\r\nmore rarely bestowed than the V.C. To earn it three conditions must be\r\nfulfilled—the feat must have been performed at risk of life; it must have\r\nbeen spontaneous, without any superior command, and it must be successful.\r\n\r\nIt was good to hear the brave sailor tell his tale, simply and without\r\nany suspicion of vainglory. He would not admit that he had done anything\r\nwonderful. He saw death before him as he stood on the bridge—a sudden\r\nidea flashed across his brain—Impossible? Why not try? That was all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1870, I left Japan. The work of the last two years\r\nhad told upon me. I was out of health, and had almost to be carried on\r\nboard ship by our good Doctor Willis. I went to Singapore, and there\r\nawaited the arrival of the Messageries ship _Hoogly_, which was to\r\nbring my friend and colleague, Gustave de Montebello, who afterwards,\r\nas Ambassador at St. Petersburg, initiated the _entente_ between France\r\nand Russia, which was destined to bear fruits which now, in 1915, are\r\nripening to their full value. A month of the _dolce far niente_ at\r\nSingapore, a life of lotus-eating, resting in a luxurious rattan chair,\r\nbreathing in a balmy, spice-laden atmosphere on a verandah broad enough\r\nto protect me from any insidious attacks of the sun, set me quite on\r\nmy legs again, and by the time my friend arrived, I was as lively as a\r\nthrush, and ready to enjoy the delights of a voyage with one of the most\r\nagreeable of companions, both of us hungry for home, and yet full of the\r\nmemories of our past experiences.\r\n\r\nMontebello was not well treated by his Government. I met him in\r\nSwitzerland not long before his death; he had been superseded, and his\r\npolitical foresight had not been recognized as it should have been; but\r\nhe was too great a gentleman to express any resentment, even to me. He\r\ndied as he had lived, a noble Frenchman, chivalrous to the last. But that\r\nhe felt acutely I well knew.\r\n\r\nOur voyage had an element of excitement in it. At Singapore we were told\r\nthat we were to go through the Suez Canal. If so, we should be the first\r\nship to go through as a matter of business, apart from the vessels that\r\nhad taken part in the gala proceedings at the opening. At Point de Galle\r\nwe heard that it was impossible. At Aden there was a fresh contradiction,\r\nand when we reached Suez, through we went! We stuck in the middle\r\nand smashed one flange of our screw, but in spite of that we reached\r\nMarseilles all right, and were immediately put in quarantine, because a\r\npoor fellow had died of consumption on board, and been buried at sea in\r\nthe Red Sea. Montebello used his official position to get himself and me\r\nlanded in spite of all objections, we being bearers of despatches—for I\r\ntook good care never to travel without a Foreign Office bag—and so with\r\nall expedition we reached Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_APPENDIX_\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT TREATISE ON POLITICS AND RELIGION, PUBLISHED TO THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n(_Translation_)\r\n\r\n“JIM MIN KOKU YU DAI I”\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO PART I\r\n\r\nThis treatise, the “Koku Yu Dai I,” is published with the object of\r\nmaking known the institutions of the Country of the Gods, and of\r\ndeclaring the intentions of the Imperial Government, and to this end five\r\ncopies will be distributed to every Kori or parochial sub-division of\r\nevery province throughout the country. The officials, and not only they,\r\nbut all well-disposed men, will give their earnest attention to this\r\nobject, and will exert themselves to instruct all persons, down to the\r\nwomen and children, in the principles of this treatise.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of publishing this treatise has been granted to the\r\nImperial Library of Kiōto, kept by Murakami Kambei, and all persons may\r\nfreely purchase it.\r\n\r\nThe above will be made known throughout all the sub-divisions of the\r\nProvince of Yamashiro.\r\n\r\n                                           (_Signed_) GOVERNMENT OF KIŌTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n“KOKU YU DAI I”\r\n\r\nMan is the sublime essence of all things. Between heaven and earth there\r\nis no more honourable thing than man. Our country is specially called\r\nthe Country of the Gods, and of all the countries in the world there is\r\nnone the institutions of which excel those of our country. Is it not\r\na disgrace past speaking of that the privileged being called man, who\r\ndwells in the excellent Country of the Gods, should pass his life in\r\nheedless vanity? Man differs from the birds and from the beasts in that\r\nhe can discern the laws of reason, and in that he has a heart capable of\r\ngratitude and virtue. Loyalty and filial piety are also the essence of\r\nthe heart of man. He who in ever so slight a degree is wanting in this\r\nheart has the face of a man but the soul of a beast, and though he be\r\nshaped as a man, yet is he even less than the birds and the beasts.\r\n\r\nIf, then, a man wishes to fulfil his duties as a man, and having been\r\nborn in the Country of the Gods desires not to turn his back upon the\r\nspirits of that country, let him above all things bear in mind the\r\nprivilege of being born a Japanese, and set his heart upon repaying the\r\ndebt of gratitude which he owes to his country.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the institutions of the Country of the Gods excel\r\nthose of other countries. Of old the heavenly ancestors of the Emperor\r\ncreated this country, and established the duties of men in their mutual\r\nrelations. Since that time the line of Emperors has never been changed.\r\nGeneration has succeeded generation in the rule of this country, and\r\nthe Imperial heart has ever been penetrated by a tender love for the\r\npeople. In their turn the people have reverenced and served generation\r\nafter generation of Emperors. In foreign countries the lines of Princes\r\nhave been frequently changed; the people owe their Sovereign a debt of\r\ngratitude which extends over two or three generations; the relations of\r\nSovereign and subject last for a hundred or two hundred years; the Prince\r\nof yesterday is the foe of to-day; the minister of yesterday is the rebel\r\nof to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIn our country we have no such folly. Since the creation of the world we\r\nhave remained unmoved; since the creation of the world the Imperial line\r\nhas been unchanged and the relations of Sovereign and subject have been\r\nundisturbed; hence it is that the spirit of gratitude has intensified and\r\ngrown deeper and deeper. The especial point in which the institutions\r\nof our country excel those of the rest of the world is the creed which\r\nhas been established by the heavenly ancestors of the Emperor, and which\r\ncomprises the mutual duties between lord and servant.\r\n\r\nEven in foreign countries, where lords and servants have over and over\r\nagain changed places, these mutual duties are handed down as a matter of\r\nweighty importance. How much the more does it behove us to pay a debt of\r\ndeep and inexhaustible gratitude which extends over the ages.\r\n\r\nIs there any man who thinks that he has never received a penny from the\r\nEmperor? Is there any man who thinks that he is not beholden to the\r\nEmperor for one tittle of help in his need? Is there any man who believes\r\nthat it is of his own merit that he passes through the world, and who\r\nfeels not the favours which he has received from his country? If there be\r\nsuch a man, great is his mistake. He is like the man in the proverb who\r\nis grateful for the light borrowed from his lamp, but is heedless of the\r\nthanks which he owes to the moon and to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe favours which a man receives from his country are so vast as to be\r\nwithout bounds. Reflect carefully upon this. Since it is by the heavenly\r\nancestors of the Emperor that this country was created, there is no\r\nsingle thing existing in the land which is not the Emperor’s. At our\r\nbirth the water in which we are washed is the Emperor’s. At our death\r\nthe ground in which we are buried is the Emperor’s. The rice which we\r\neat, the clothes which we wear, the cap which we put on, the staff which\r\nsupports us, are all the produce of the Emperor’s land.\r\n\r\nAgain, the money which enables us to pass through life easily is coined\r\nby the will of the Emperor; so that whether we hoard our wealth or give\r\nout our coin to meet our daily wants, it is by the help of the Emperor\r\nthat we are able to transact our business.\r\n\r\nFurther, lest wicked men should hinder us, offices and guard-houses are\r\nestablished in different places. Ruffians and thieves are punished;\r\nchildren may be trusted to walk abroad with money, and no man will rob\r\nthem; old men and women may be left to watch the house, and lawless men\r\nwill not break in. You plant your fields with rice and your gardens with\r\ngreen things. You set out goods for sale and clothes to dry in your shops\r\nand wayside stalls, and no man comes to steal them; here is no small\r\ncause of gratitude. If perchance any evil deed should be done, no means\r\nare left untried to discover the guilty man, and the Imperial orders are\r\nissued to punish him according to his crime.\r\n\r\nIf there were no such Imperial authority to exercise justice, each man\r\nwould have to trust to his own strength. The weak would be slain by the\r\nstrong; the old would be pushed over by the young; rice and money would\r\nbe seized by force. But since this exercise of justice exists, although a\r\nsingle or double hedge may be easily broken through, there is no need to\r\nset guards, for there are none to force an entrance, and so we pass our\r\nlives in peace and safety.\r\n\r\nThere are yet further ways in which the generations of Emperors have\r\ncared for the sorrow of their people. Remember with reverence that there\r\nwas once an Emperor who in the cold winter night stripped his clothes\r\nthat he might know by his own feelings the sufferings of the poor.[22]\r\nWhen he looked at the rice before him he reflected that the grain was\r\nplanted by the sweat of the farmers, and acknowledged their labours. We\r\nmust be truly grateful that morning and night the Emperor’s prayers have\r\nbeen offered up that his people might be spared from storm and from rain;\r\nfrom famine, plague, and cholera. Nor is it for ourselves alone, nor for\r\nour generation only, that our gratitude is due. Since the creation of\r\nthe world generation after generation of our ancestors have passed their\r\nlives under the shadow of their Emperors. How many endless generations\r\nof our children’s children shall be nurtured under the same gracious\r\nprotection?\r\n\r\nDuring the last three hundred years, the land being at peace, the power\r\nof the Emperor was gradually relaxed. Although the Emperor existed, it\r\nwas as though he were no more. The consideration and love of the Emperor\r\nfor his people did not reach them; it was arrested on its way. Bribery\r\nand corruption flourished; even good men fell into evil ways, and bad men\r\nprospered. The Emperor was greatly afflicted; he neither ate nor rested\r\nin peace. Still, however great might be the afflictions which he had\r\nto undergo himself, they were as nothing to those which he suffered on\r\naccount of his people’s grief.\r\n\r\nNow at last the Imperial Government has been restored to its ancient\r\nform; the affairs of the country are placed upon a brilliant basis; the\r\nhearts of great and small are united; the desires of all men have been\r\naccomplished, and men may more than ever pass their lives in peaceful\r\ntranquillity. Preserving those institutions in which the Emperor’s\r\ncountry excels all other countries, we will illustrate the power of our\r\nEmperor to the world. Reverently receiving the Imperial will, we will\r\nhumbly obey his commands; we will set our hearts upon serving him for\r\nhis sake. Bent upon requiting every particle or hair’s breadth of favour\r\nreceived during generations after generations, we will not turn our backs\r\nupon our duty as the people of the Country of the Gods.\r\n\r\nFirst year of Meiji (1868).\r\n\r\n(Printed officially by the Imperial Printers. Published at Kiōto by\r\nMurakami Kambei and Inouyé Jihei; at Yedo, by Mohei at the Suwaraya; and\r\nIchibei, at the Idzumiya.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO PART II\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion in the first part of this treatise, we set forth\r\nthe institutions of the Country of the Gods, and made known the will of\r\nthe Imperial Government; in continuation of this we now publish a second\r\npart, in which we shall treat of the form and power of the countries of\r\nthe world, and shall show how the best interests of our divine country\r\nmay be served. Officials and all well-disposed men will give their\r\nearnest attention to this object, and will exert themselves to instruct\r\nall persons, down to the women and children, in the principles of this\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of publishing this treatise has been granted to the\r\nImperial Library at Kiōto, kept by Murakami Kambei, and all persons may\r\nfreely purchase it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Imperial journey to Yedo last year, his Majesty\r\ntook upon himself the direction of the machinery of the State. Up to that\r\ntime the precepts of the Emperor had not reached the Eastern Provinces\r\nof the country. While the accumulated masses of business were only\r\nhalf-accomplished, the days and nights had sped swiftly, and the period\r\nfor the celebration of rites on the third anniversary of the death of the\r\nlate Emperor had come round.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty accordingly in the first place returned to Kiōto, and having\r\nconcluded the funeral rites and his own marriage ceremony, he gave orders\r\nfor his second visit to Yedo. Thus does he again subject his sacred\r\nperson to fatigue, and although it may be said that this is owing to\r\nthe spirit of the time, yet it is in truth a matter to be grateful for,\r\nand the people, perceiving the Emperor’s intentions, should deeply and\r\ncarefully lay them to heart.\r\n\r\nNow the spirit of the present differs from the spirit of the past. The\r\ncountries of the world have joined themselves in a relationship of peace\r\nand friendship. Steamers are sent round the world, heedless of stormy\r\nwaves or of foul winds. The communication between lands distant ten\r\nthousand miles from one another is as that between neighbours; country\r\ncompetes with country in producing rifles and guns and machinery, and\r\neach revolves plans for its own advantage and profit. Each vies with\r\nthe other in devising schemes to obtain the mastery, each exerts itself\r\nto keep up the strength of its armies, each and everyone strives to\r\ninvent warlike contrivances. But in spite of all this, there is a great\r\nprinciple existing over all the world which prevents civilized countries\r\nfrom being lightly and lawlessly attacked.\r\n\r\nThis principle is called international law. How much the more, then,\r\nwould our divine country, the institutions of which excel those of all\r\nother countries, be turning her back upon the sacred precepts established\r\nby the heavenly ancestors of the Emperor should she be guilty of violent\r\nand lawless acts. Such a thing would be the greatest shame and disgrace\r\nto the Country of the Gods. Hence it is that the Emperor has extended a\r\nfaithful alliance to those foreigners who come here lawfully and rightly,\r\nand they are allowed free and uninterrupted access to this country.\r\nFollowing this example set by the Emperor, his subjects when they receive\r\nno insult from the foreigner should observe the same principle and\r\nrefrain from blows and fighting. If by any chance we should be put to\r\nshame before the foreigner it is hard to say what consequences may ensue.\r\n\r\nIt is our especial duty to publish to the world beyond the seas the\r\nancient spirit of the Country of the Gods and the excellent institutions\r\nestablished by the heavenly ancestors of the Emperor, that the countries\r\nof the world may admire and envy the power of our Sovereign. To this\r\nend it is above all things needful that the whole of Japan should be\r\npenetrated by the Imperial precepts, and that the strength of the country\r\nshould be united in one whole. Without this it will be hard for the\r\nspirit of the country to stand, without this, on the contrary, we shall\r\nhave to endure the scorn of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nShould so much as a hair’s end of shame attach to the Country of the\r\nGods, what excuse can we offer to the long line of Emperors who succeeded\r\ntheir heavenly ancestors. To be the cause of grief to the Emperor is\r\nworse than irreverence.\r\n\r\nThe country districts of the Eastern Provinces are far removed from the\r\ncapital, and there are persons who, not awed by the will of the Emperor,\r\nsubject the people, as it were, to torture by fire and torture by water.\r\nTerrible as the conduct of such men is, the great mercy and pity of the\r\nEmperor’s heart acknowledges that their fault is to be laid to the fact\r\nthat his precepts have not reached them; we see with reverent gratitude\r\nthat he takes their sins upon himself and that his generous rule spares\r\nthem. Further, that by the spreading of his precepts all ignorance may\r\ncease, he undertakes a long journey, braving the heat and the cold, and\r\nexposing his precious person to fatigue.\r\n\r\nAs far as the extreme limits of the islands of Yesso and of Liukiu\r\nthe Emperor treats all men who are born on Japanese soil as his own\r\nchildren. He makes no distinctions between men—caressing the one and\r\nrepelling the other. He looks upon all alike, his mercy extends to all.\r\nHis compassionate love for his people knows no rest by day or by night.\r\nAfter a while he will be pleased to visit all his dominions. The present\r\ncapital, Kiōto, has been the Imperial residence for more than a thousand\r\nyears, and in its sacred earth are buried the ancestors of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIt follows that of all places that is the place which the Emperor reveres\r\nthe most. You, whose special privilege it is to dwell near this spot,\r\nbathed in the dew of the Emperor’s deep mercy, reverently acknowledge\r\nhis will, and penetrated by the sense of this feeling, in all matters\r\nhumbly obey his commands. Loyalty and filial piety arouse you to observe\r\nour upright and excellent institutions. Let each man zealously perform\r\nhis special duties, that he may relieve the mind of the Emperor of its\r\ntroubles, and let each man, so far as in him lies, set his heart upon the\r\nsacred cause of our divine country.\r\n\r\nSecond year of Meiji (1869).\r\n\r\n(Printed officially by the Imperial Printers, Yedo.

Although the publication of pirated\r\neditions of other books is strictly forbidden, an exception is made in\r\nfavour of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n1870\r\n\r\nHOME AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached France it seemed as if at every corner I was to meet\r\nold friends—all of them in difficulties—the result of an epidemic of\r\nplunging on the Turf—very catching. At Marseilles I happened upon an old\r\nChrist Church friend, whom I had left five years before in London, the\r\nsmartest of the smart. He was staying in the same hotel, and as I arrived\r\nluggageless and in great discomfort, he very kindly supplied me with all\r\nthat I wanted, amongst other things with quite the most luxurious night\r\napparel that ever I slept in. We had a very pleasant evening together,\r\ntalking over old times, and the next morning he came to see me off at the\r\nstation. As the train was just moving, he put his head in at the window\r\nand said, “By the bye, old fellow, when you get to London, please don’t\r\nsay you’ve seen me!”\r\n\r\nAt Paris, where I was to stay two days, my first visit was to my\r\ncolleagues at the Embassy. I asked who was in Paris. “Oh!” said they,\r\n“—— is staying here,” and they gave me the address of a wretched little\r\n_hôtel borgne_ in a side street off the Boulevard. I went off to see\r\nhim; it was the shabbiest house even in that shabbiest offshoot of a\r\nbrilliant neighbourhood—one of those violent contrasts which are the\r\nessence of Paris. I rang at the bell and was looked over from head to\r\nfoot; obviously a suspicious character. However, I sent up my card, was\r\nadmitted, and joyously welcomed by my friend, who was lying in bed.\r\nIt was three o’clock in the afternoon—half an hour later than my Lord\r\nTomnoddy’s time for getting up. I asked the reason. His clothes were all\r\nin pawn! I wanted to wash my hands and asked for a towel. “I’m so sorry!\r\nI can’t lend you one; the people of the house won’t let me have any\r\nlinen for fear of my pawning it, but there is a dirty flannel shirt in\r\nthe corner—you can dry your hands on that!” I left him, carrying off his\r\npawn-tickets, and went off to see whether I could make up a purse among\r\nsome of our friends.\r\n\r\nIn an hour I was back with his garments liberated and a small sum of\r\nmoney to go on with—twenty pounds, I remember. He was soon dressed,\r\nas spick and span a dandy as you could meet in Bond Street, or on the\r\nBoulevard, handsome as a picture and as gay as if he had not a care in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWe went out to see another friend (not in difficulties) and I wanted to\r\nturn down the Rue Laffitte. Impossible!—there was a bootmaker there who\r\nwould pounce upon him and make a scandal. So it was with several streets\r\nand several trades. At last we reached the flower-market outside the\r\nMadeleine. That was worst of all, for there was “an infernal old woman\r\nthere whose fortune he had made by inventing a button-hole, and she would\r\nscratch his eyes out if he did not settle her wicked bill.” We parted in\r\nthe Champs Elysées.\r\n\r\nThat night poor Greville Sartoris and I were going to see Pasca, the\r\nactress who was all the rage at the moment, and we dined first at the\r\nCafé Anglais. When we got there whom should we see but my impecunious\r\nfriend, beautifully got up, with a rosebud in his buttonhole, finishing\r\na delicate little dinner with a _salade d’ananas_ and a pint of Perrier\r\nJouet. When Georges, the waiter, came up with his bill, he said, “Tenez,\r\nGeorges, il y a longtemps que je ne vous ai rien donné,” and gave\r\nhim five napoleons, telling him to keep the change. I could not help\r\nexclaiming at this. “Ah! my dear fellow,” said he, “you don’t begin to\r\nknow how to live on nothing at all. Those five napoleons will enable me\r\nto lunch and dine here for a month on credit!” And with that he opened\r\nhis crush hat and went off to dazzle somebody else besides Georges and us.\r\n\r\nMy friend’s career had been remarkable. He was very handsome, very\r\nclever, and was successful in his profession; but he threw it up and\r\npreferred following the fortunes of the King of the Plungers. There was\r\na short period of success, on the strength of which he mounted a little\r\nhouse in a very expensive street, engaged a first-rate cook, and gave\r\nchoice dinners. That did not last long—there came a crisis, a crash, and\r\nan escape into that dingy disreputable hostelry off the Boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Plungers was Harry Hastings—the last Marquis—who was my\r\nfag at Eton. He was an attractive little boy, and I think that everybody\r\nliked him; but his ideas when he grew up were on too large a scale. He\r\nhad no health, and by burning the candle at both ends, and in the middle,\r\nsealed his own fate.\r\n\r\nOld Lord Wilton told me that when Hastings was Master of Hounds once the\r\nhounds came to a check and some of them were straying; he called out to\r\nhim: “Blow your horn, Harry, blow your horn!” “That’s all very well, Lord\r\nWilton,” he replied, “but if I blow my horn I shall be sick!” That did\r\nnot suit the grand old horseman, one of the finest riders I ever saw, who\r\nonce at Melton, when the field was stopped by a gate, came up behind,\r\ncalling out: “I’ve got the key, gentlemen!” They all made a lane for him,\r\nand “the wicked Earl” as he was affectionately called, cantered up and\r\nflew over the gate like a bird.\r\n\r\nHarry Hastings was not without a certain cleverness, and the ring knew\r\nit. Steel, the famous bookmaker of those days, was once heard to grumble\r\nas Hastings left him, after some transaction at the rails at Ascot: “Ah!\r\nmy lord, Heaven’s been very gracious to you, for you look a fool and you\r\nain’t one!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day I was in London. I wonder whether other men feel the same\r\nshyness about coming home that I have always done, especially after\r\nhaving been a long time away in some remote country where everything is\r\nstrange and topsy-turvy, as different from England as is the tinkling\r\nof a _samishen_ or _koto_ from the sonorous art of Bach or Beethoven.\r\nThen again, even an attaché is in his small way a person of some\r\nlittle consideration abroad, but Ambassadors, Governors, Ministers\r\nPlenipotentiary themselves, as soon as they reach London, are whirled\r\nlike straws in the maelstrom, and count as little. Lord Dufferin gave\r\nthe best and wittiest expression to this shrinkage of greatness when he\r\nsaid: “Twenty-five minutes of Pall Mall are enough to take the conceit\r\neven out of a Viceroy of India!”\r\n\r\nThen think of the poor little attaché whose sleigh at a place like St.\r\nPetersburg (Petrograd from henceforth) has taken precedence of those of\r\nall the magnates in the land, and forgive him if for a moment he thought\r\nhimself Somebody—pity him when he awakes from his dream and realizes that\r\nhe is Nobody!\r\n\r\nBut the strangest feeling of all was the wonder as to how I should be\r\nreceived by those whose welcome had been looked to with such loving\r\nanticipation, and such timorous anxiety. I felt like a sort of pale and\r\nfaded version of the prodigal son. I need have been under no fear. My\r\nfather’s old servant, the faithful friend of a quarter of a century,\r\nmet me at the station. The tears were in his good, old, kind eyes. My\r\nfather was waiting for me at Hobart Place, and in half an hour my dear\r\nold cousin, Lord Redesdale, in spite of a sharp attack of gout, came in\r\nto shake me by the hand. It did not take long to make me feel as if I had\r\nnever strayed away from home. Peking, Mongolia, Japan, the revolution,\r\nfaded like shadows of dreamland. There were more grey hairs in my\r\nfather’s head, a few coming in my own—otherwise little change. The Great\r\nReaper had been merciful, for of those nearest and dearest to me the\r\nscythe of death had spared almost all.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in reporting myself at the Foreign Office, where I found\r\nvery few changes. Mr. Hammond was as kind as ever, and said many pleasant\r\nthings to me about the work that I had done in the East, for he was\r\nalways generous in his appreciation of any endeavour on the part of his\r\nsubordinates. What pleased me very much was that I was to have a year’s\r\nleave. I had been a good deal knocked up by the strenuous life of the\r\nlast two years in Japan, and my old friend, Dr. Quain, had commanded a\r\nrest, so the idea of a long holiday was very welcome—the more so as I was\r\ngetting ready my “Tales of Old Japan” for the press, a formidable first\r\nplunge into the world of letters. Lord Clarendon, who was then Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs, hearing that I was in the office, sent for\r\nme and kept me with him for some time, talking over the intricacies\r\nof the Japanese revolution, and bade me go and see him in Grosvenor\r\nCrescent. My own colleagues were to the full as gracious as the big men,\r\nso I had no reason to complain of my first visit to the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nAltogether I felt that I had come back to a kind and generous world, and\r\nwhen I went into certain drawing-rooms with the same arm-chairs, the same\r\ncurtains, and the same Sèvres vases on the chimney-pieces as of yore, I\r\nhardly needed the cordial greeting to assure me that I was as much at\r\nhome there as I had been five long years ago.\r\n\r\nBy no one was I made more welcome than by Mrs. Sartoris (Adelaide\r\nKemble). She was a very old friend of ours, and I had known her from\r\nmy boyhood. Her house was a gathering-place for all that was most\r\ndistinguished in Letters and Art. Her dinners were perfection—never more\r\nthan eight or ten—for her dining-room was small, and she knew better\r\nthan to crowd her guests. She was now no longer young, but so witty, so\r\nfull of pleasant memories, and one of the best leaders of talk that I\r\never knew. Of an evening she would be surrounded by such men as Charles\r\nDickens, Matthew Arnold, Leighton, while Sir Charles Hallé would sit down\r\nat her piano and accompany Joachim or Madame Norman Neruda, the great\r\nartists playing just for the love of music and of her. The society was\r\nvery catholic, for she was equally beloved of the stately dames who were\r\nthe law-givers of the great world. She herself would sometimes sing some\r\nsong of Gounod or Alary; her voice had grown rather thin, but the way in\r\nwhich she told the story of her song was exquisite.\r\n\r\nI used to go most afternoons to tea in Park Place, just for the pleasure\r\nof hearing her talk. She had little patience with the affectations of\r\nthe modern æsthetes then just coming into vogue. I remember once at\r\nthe Monday Popular Concerts one of those young men coming up to her\r\nand saying: “Oh! Mrs. Sartoris, did you notice that divine diminished\r\nseventh?” “My dear boy,” was the answer, “don’t talk nonsense—a\r\ndiminished seventh is mere grammar. You might as well rave about the\r\ndivinity of an ablative absolute in a poem.”\r\n\r\nShe told us one day that as she had been hunting, as was her wont in the\r\nold shops in Wardour Street, a man, obviously a foreigner, followed her\r\nrather offensively. At last she turned round upon him and lifting her\r\nveil, said: “Il paraît que monsieur est amateur d’antiquités.” The man\r\nfled before the grand severe face. She had the beautiful features and\r\nthe solemn expression of the Kemble family, reminding one of the great\r\nportrait of her aunt, Mrs. Siddons. When she was in a serious mood it\r\nwas the countenance of a sibyl. It was a loss indeed when she, smitten\r\nby the unbearable grief of her son’s tragic death, thrown by his horse\r\nlarking over a hurdle, sought refuge in solitude and silence. People even\r\nnow delight in her “Week in a French Country House”—a description of life\r\nin the château of the Marquis de L’Aigle, who married Mrs. Sartoris’\r\nsister-in-law. It was a dainty book illustrated by Leighton, but for\r\nmyself I even preferred her “Past Hours.” Those who never knew her may\r\nthere see the reflection of her brilliant talk; but nothing can give the\r\neffect of her words as she uttered them, her eager face lighted up by the\r\nfire of her fine imagination.\r\n\r\nShe had the greatest horror of evil-speaking and slandering. I was\r\npresent once when somebody told an ugly story about a young married\r\ncouple. She turned upon the speaker with withering scorn, and her eyes\r\nflashed as she said: “Why can’t you leave them alone? If you must abuse\r\nsomebody abuse us old people. Don’t help to destroy any chance that the\r\nyoung ones may have of being happy. Besides, how do you know that you are\r\nnot lending a hand in spreading a lie?” And so she crushed the pedlar of\r\nscandal, who had to carry his pack elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember whether her description of the violoncellist—a sly hit\r\nat her friend, the famous Piatti—who “bore his cross meekly in a world\r\ntoo much peopled with amateurs,” has ever been printed; even so it is\r\nworth repeating. One evening there was a discussion as to the relative\r\nadvantages of married and unmarried life. She remained silent until a\r\ngreat friend of hers—an old bachelor—stuck up stoutly for the freedom\r\nof the unmarried. Then very softly she said: “Poor fellow! with nothing\r\nbetter to go home to than a flat candlestick!”\r\n\r\nOne night towards the end of May I was at the theatre with Charles\r\nDickens and old Lady Molesworth. Just we three in a private box. Between\r\nthe acts we had great fun. Dickens was in high spirits, brim-full of\r\nthe _joie de vivre_. His talk had all the sparkle of champagne, and he\r\nhimself kept laughing at the majesty of his own absurdities, as one droll\r\nthought followed another. He was not always in such a vein, for if he\r\nthought he was being lionized he would sit mumchance; but he really liked\r\nthe old lady and of course I did not count; so he was at his ease and at\r\nhis very best, so bright, so merry and—like his books—so human.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening Lady Molesworth insisted on his naming a night to\r\ngo and dine with her. The date was fixed and on the following day the\r\ninvitations came out for a day in June. Alas! That dinner never came off,\r\nfor on the 9th of June, two or three days before the night agreed upon,\r\nthe whole English-speaking world was stricken with grief. Dickens was\r\nlying dead at his beloved Gad’s Hill. It seemed impossible. He had been\r\nso brilliant that night. He was only fifty-eight years of age, twenty\r\nyears younger than I am at this time of writing, and though we knew that\r\nhe suffered terribly from exhaustion after his readings, which seemed\r\nto sap all his energy, undermined as it had been by the strain of many\r\ntroubles, added to hard and incessant work, he was at times still so\r\nyoung and almost boyish in his gaiety that it was an unspeakable shock.\r\n\r\nThose murderous readings which killed him were enthralling. Never shall I\r\nforget the effect produced by his reading of the death of Steerforth; it\r\nwas tragedy itself, and when he closed the book and his voice ceased the\r\naudience for a moment seemed paralysed, and one could almost hear a sigh\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\nHad he, as he was once minded to do, taken up acting as a profession he\r\nwould have been as famous as Garrick. Would the gaiety of nations have\r\nbeen as darkly eclipsed as it was when he died and “Edwin Drood” remained\r\na mystery?\r\n\r\nLady Molesworth was a great figure-head in London society. At her house\r\nwere to be met all the prominent personages in the great world, from the\r\nPrince of Wales downwards, and there was always a goodly leaven of Art\r\nand Literature. She had herself been a singer in early life, and was very\r\nkind to young and struggling professional musicians. When she married Sir\r\nWilliam Molesworth she was the widow of Mr. Temple West, and it was her\r\ninfluence which converted Sir William, a mathematician, philosopher, and\r\nas much a recluse as a Parliamentarian and Secretary of State could be,\r\ninto a man of the world. Their dinners under her auspices became famous,\r\nand when he died his last injunction to her was said upon her authority\r\nto have been “Keep up the little dinners.” He left his place in Cornwall,\r\nPencarrow, to her for her lifetime, and in her hospitality there and\r\nin Eaton Place she liberally and loyally carried out his behests. The\r\n“little dinners” did more to keep the dead philosopher’s memory green\r\nthan his great edition of “Hobbes” in sixteen volumes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere I may say a word about the early days of the Marlborough Club.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales was above all things a man of the most social habits;\r\nthe companionship of congenial friends was a necessity to him; he was\r\nessentially what Dr. Johnson called a clubable man, and so there came\r\na moment when he felt the need of a club where he might go and play a\r\nrubber and smoke a cigar with his intimates without formality, as the\r\nspirit moved him. He made inquiries as to what club would best suit\r\nhis purpose. White’s, then the smartest club in London, was suggested.\r\nWould he be free to smoke where he pleased? The old curled dandies of\r\nthe terrible bay window, to walk below which was a terror to the young\r\nand innocent, said No!—there must be no smoking except in the appointed\r\nplace. To them tobacco was as great an abomination as Ashtaroth to the\r\nSidonians. That sealed the fate of White’s.\r\n\r\nThere was a freehold plot of land opposite Marlborough House. The site\r\nwas bought, the house was built, and the Prince founded the club, himself\r\nbecoming President. I was not an original member, for I was in the Far\r\nEast when it was opened in the late autumn of 1869, but I was elected in\r\nthe following May, immediately on my return home. Lord Tweeddale, then\r\nLord Walden, was Chairman of the Committee, of which I became a member\r\nin 1871. At Lord Tweeddale’s death in 1878 Lord Colville of Culross was\r\nelected chairman, and when he died in 1902 I received the following\r\nletter from the secretary of the club.\r\n\r\n                                                   “July 16th, 1902.\r\n\r\n    “MY LORD,\r\n\r\n    “I have the honour to inform you that at a special meeting of\r\n    the General Committee held this afternoon your lordship was\r\n    unanimously elected chairman of the committee for the ensuing\r\n    year, and that you were proposed for the office by His Majesty\r\n    the King, seconded by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n                             “I have, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                               (Signed) C. H. STONE,\r\n                                               “Secretary.”\r\n\r\nI may be perhaps forgiven for recording an honour which is unique in club\r\nlife. From that year to the present (1915) I have been re-elected every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFrom 1869 until the time when, after his accession, His Majesty removed\r\nto Buckingham Palace the Marlborough Club was King Edward’s favourite\r\nhaunt. It was so convenient. He was able to cross over from Marlborough\r\nHouse with his gentleman-in-waiting, or, on his return from the opera\r\nor the play, to send away his carriage and walk home. When he took\r\npossession of the Palace it was less handy for him; he had to keep a\r\ncarriage and servants which made a difficulty, and so the club saw\r\nless of him. But he continued—as, indeed, does King George—to take the\r\ngreatest interest in its welfare, nothing being done without its being\r\nsubmitted to him, and once a year to the end, on his return from abroad,\r\nhe did me the honour of dining with me there.\r\n\r\nThe hours in the old days of the club were very late. The Prince never\r\nseemed to know what fatigue meant. He would sit playing whist or writing\r\nletters—he was a most punctual and voluminous correspondent—till any\r\nhour. Often a party of us would stream into St. James’s Street in the\r\ngrey dawn, to be distributed by hansom cabs in various directions, and\r\nsleep out the morning, cross if any mischance should awaken us. He, on\r\nthe contrary, would often be off by the first train, radiant with health\r\nand strength and good humour, to attend some distant function, where he\r\nwould shine as if he had spent the whole night in bed; for with him\r\npleasure was never allowed to interfere with duty. After about 1880 he\r\nbecame more prudent and more conscious of the necessity of sparing a\r\ncertain amount of time for sleep. Even then he did much work late at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAmerican bowls were much the fashion in those days and the ground floor\r\nof the club was turned into a bowling alley, which has now been parcelled\r\noff into two billiard rooms. A good many of us regretted the noisy old\r\nalley which was a meeting-place for the happy little crowd that laughed\r\nthere every night, none gayer, none more bright, none more instinct with\r\nthe joy of life than the brilliant young Prince himself. Such was the\r\nMarlborough Club in the seventies. Downstairs skittles, fun and frolic;\r\nupstairs whist and the seriousness of the catacombs. Hartington, James\r\nClay, Batchelor, St. Albans, Owen Williams and others, all as solemn as\r\nschoolmasters; the Prince himself leading the gravity up above as he had\r\nbeen leading the gaiety below, and playing a capital rubber. There are\r\nvery few of the old set left and as one of the survivors wrote to me the\r\nother day, upon the death of another, “the leaves are falling fast.”\r\n\r\nOne afternoon—it was 1872, but I prefer to tell the story here—I was all\r\nalone in the club when Sleeman, the then steward of the club, came into\r\nthe room surcharged with importance and told me that the Emperor of the\r\nFrench, who was a member, was down below, and asked permission to bring\r\nin the Duc de Bassano, who was his Lord Chamberlain. It was his first\r\nvisit and I ran down to receive him, took him upstairs, and established\r\nhim in an arm-chair with the evening paper. After a while he called me\r\nup and began questioning me as to my profession and the various posts at\r\nwhich I had been. We had a long talk, for he had to kill time waiting for\r\nhis train.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoléon, whose faculty of silence is a matter of history, was,\r\nwhen he chose, a very agreeable talker, and his conversation was pointed\r\nby a certain dry, sardonic humour accentuated by his rather saturnine\r\nappearance. He was looking miserably ill, his face ashen grey, and his\r\nlack-lustre eyes significant of the pain by which, for years, he had been\r\ntortured; his figure was bowed and aged—obviously a man waging an unequal\r\nwar with disease. He talked a good deal about the missionary question\r\nin China and Corea, upon which he was thoroughly well posted, and he\r\nalso spoke with a great deal of feeling about the murder of his men, the\r\nsailors of the _Dupleix_, in 1868. After half an hour’s talk with him I\r\nunderstood the charm which he exercised over men and women when he chose\r\nto do so. I also understood that when Kinglake fired all the arrows of\r\nbitterness at him there could be but one cause—a woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo go back to the year 1870. There was a great performance of the\r\n_Barbiere_ with Mario as Almaviva. I happened to be in the stage-box;\r\nMario saw me, gave me a little friendly sign of greeting and welcome\r\nhome. To my surprise who should come into the box between the acts but\r\nthe Prince of Wales. He began talking in his old friendly way, very\r\nanxious to hear all about the Duke of Edinburgh’s reception in Japan,\r\nand bade me to dinner, _en petit comité_, on the following Sunday. It\r\nwas a delightful little party of about ten people in the small upstairs\r\ndining-room—quite without ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe season of 1870 was brilliant. London was at its gayest. But London\r\nmight dine, flock to the play or the opera, and dance to the strains of\r\nStrauss’s famous waltz, “An der schönen blauen Donau,” then a novelty;\r\nbut trouble was brewing, the dogs of war were straining at their leashes,\r\nthough men knew it not; and at the very moment when there was the most\r\nneed for his services the pilot was torn from the helm—Lord Clarendon\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nLORD CLARENDON AND LORD GRANVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generation of the Villiers family to which Lord Clarendon belonged\r\nwere people singularly gifted with charm and ability. I did not know the\r\nBishop, nor did I know Mr. Edward Villiers, but Lady Theresa Lewis was a\r\nmost attractive personality. She must have been very pretty in her youth,\r\nand when I knew her as the mother of grown-up children she was a most\r\nfascinating hostess, clever, agreeable, accomplished, doing the honours\r\nof Kent House with all the grace of a finished _grande dame_.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Villiers was first returned for Wolverhampton in January,\r\n1835. He retained the seat for sixty-four years and died in January,\r\n1898, aged ninety-six. The last time that he voted in the House of\r\nCommons was in 1894 against Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill. I had the honour\r\nof giving him my arm to walk through the lobbies. He was bent, infirm,\r\nand very tottery, but his mind was as full of fire as ever, and his wit\r\nnimble and good to listen to. That was the last time that I saw him and\r\nhad speech of him.\r\n\r\nCharles Villiers was universally admitted to be the best of good company;\r\nhe was a wonderful talker and he was ever ready in repartee, his ripostes\r\nbeing the perfection of fencing; but his sallies were sometimes, like\r\nthose of Bernal Osborne, a little apt to be biting. He had not the\r\nsparkling, happy nature of his great brother, Lord Clarendon, whose\r\nringing laugh would put a whole roomful of guests in a good humour. I do\r\nnot think that I ever came across a man who, in spite of the gout, seemed\r\nso instinct with the joy of life as Lord Clarendon. In his youth he was\r\naccused of being rather boisterous, and Lord Granville once told me that\r\nhis mother, old Lady Granville, the witty Ambassadress at Paris, said of\r\nhim rather slily: “Yes, George Villiers, with a slight headache, is the\r\nmost agreeable young man in London.”\r\n\r\nHis gaiety was infectious, and few more lovable men have ever enriched\r\nthe happiness of those to whom he extended that generous sympathy—the\r\nsecret of the affection in which he was held by all with whom he came in\r\ncontact, from Queen to Peer and Peasant. The gracious manner, the happy\r\nturn of an epigrammatic sentence, the droll humour, the gift of being a\r\nlistener as well as a talker—who shall say that these are not valuable\r\nassets even in a statesman’s wallet?\r\n\r\nI first made his acquaintance about the year 1858 and used constantly\r\nto be invited to the Grove, which surely was the merriest and brightest\r\ncountry house in all England. And there were two or three other homes\r\nhard by, also filled with young people ready for fun of all sorts—the\r\nRokebys, Eburys and the Mill, where Mrs. Edward Villiers lived—all\r\nfurnishing their quota of dancing dogs and pretty girls, so that\r\nthere was a perfect succession of balls, theatricals and music; but\r\nI doubt whether any of us young people took more delight in all the\r\nentertainments than the great statesman and diplomatist whose gaiety was\r\nso infectious. He was strikingly handsome and had that air of distinction\r\nwhich means so much more than mere beauty; when the two are combined\r\ntheir possessor ranks with the demigods.\r\n\r\nAs a host he had the rare gift of drawing out every one of his friends to\r\nthe best advantage, so that after a dinner-party of sixteen or eighteen\r\npeople in Grosvenor Crescent every guest was sent home on the best of\r\npossible terms with himself, feeling that he, too, had played his little\r\npart not altogether in vain.\r\n\r\nTo younger men his kindness knew no bounds. When I came back from Russia\r\nin 1864 he was not Secretary of State, but he sent for me and told me\r\nthat he had had a very flattering letter about me from my chief, Lord\r\nNapier, which made him wish to have a quiet talk about Russian policy and\r\nthe great men in St. Petersburg, where he had himself been in his youth\r\nas attaché. Lord Napier, it seemed, had told him that I had had rather\r\nspecial opportunities of becoming acquainted with some of the various\r\nRussian statesmen and influential persons, and had, from time to time,\r\nbeen able to supplement his own information. Lord Clarendon kept me with\r\nhim for an hour or more, and when I took leave of him he said: “I shall\r\ntell Palmerston that he must see you, so do not go out of town till you\r\nhear from him.” Two days afterwards I received a summons to Cambridge\r\nHouse and had another long talk with Lord Palmerston, who was as genial\r\nand kind as he always had been, cross-examined me at length, and sent me\r\non to see Lord Halifax at the India Office.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the three interviews was curious. The two great\r\nmen were not above seeing whether the young man could tell them anything\r\nworth hearing—Lord Halifax was kindness itself, but he only wished to\r\ntalk. As for wanting to hear what I might be able to say he had no care\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nThe last time that I saw Lord Clarendon was, as I have already intimated,\r\nin the early summer of 1870. During the time that I was in the Far East\r\nhe used to make my father send him the letters which I wrote home, and\r\nwhen I reached London his welcome to me was of the warmest. He at once\r\ninvited me to dinner, and after dinner kept me in talk for some time. He\r\nasked me about the book I was writing, giving me great encouragement and\r\nsome advice, which, unlike most advice, was followed. Two or three weeks\r\nlater he was gone. On the 27th of April he died in harness, in the heat\r\nof the work which he loved so well, and busy with the craft of which he\r\nwas a past master.\r\n\r\nWas Bismarck right in saying that if he had lived the war of 1870 would\r\nnot have taken place? I doubt it. I think that when Bismarck made his\r\nfamous speech to Lady Ampthill, telling her that nothing had ever given\r\nhim so much pleasure as her father’s death, because it meant that his\r\nschemes would not be foiled, that was his rough, _burschikos_ way of\r\npaying her a compliment on Lord Clarendon’s power, sagacity and skill\r\nas a diplomatist. There is no doubt that he had immense influence both\r\nwith Louis Napoléon and with the Empress, whom he had known as a child in\r\nthe intimacy of her mother’s house when he was Minister at Madrid; but\r\nthere were silent intrigues of which the English Foreign Office and our\r\nAmbassadors abroad knew nothing, as was shown when Mr. Hammond told Lord\r\nGranville on his taking over Lord Clarendon’s succession that there never\r\nhad been a time when there was such a perfectly peaceful outlook. In a\r\nfortnight the Paris mob was shouting “_A Berlin!_”\r\n\r\nIn recent works Mr. Hammond has been greatly and most unjustly blamed for\r\nhis want of prescience. Nothing could be more unfair. Mr. Hammond was\r\nguided by the reports, and, more important still, by the private letters,\r\nof the Ambassadors at Paris, Berlin, and other Courts. That no one—not\r\neven Bismarck himself—knew how near war was is amply proved by Bismarck’s\r\nown memoirs. The thing fell like a thunder-clap—the result of the Ems\r\nepisode—and Bismarck was as much staggered as the rest of the world by\r\nthe opportunity which arose for him.\r\n\r\nThings had gone too far for any hope of successful official interference.\r\nHad Lord Clarendon been out of office, able to go to Paris, and discuss\r\nmatters face to face with the Emperor, who loved him, his winning ways\r\nand sound sense might, at an earlier moment, a few weeks sooner, have had\r\nsome effect. But chained to a desk in Downing Street, only able to speak,\r\nas it were, through an interpreter, and only informed by agents who\r\ncould not report a secret which was well kept because it did not exist,\r\nhis power was largely discounted—the personal element was, of course,\r\nentirely wanting. Moreover, it was too late; the threat and the execution\r\nwere simultaneous. Both sides were bent on war, and both were working in\r\na deadly secrecy which has perhaps never been surpassed. The most astute\r\ndiplomatists, the most practised politicians, were not prepared for the\r\nstorm that was about to burst; the barometer had given no indication.\r\n\r\nFrance was upon the brink of a volcano. Deep below the surface there were\r\nunderground mutterings and growls which sent shivers of fear through\r\nthose who knew, and yet, like London, Paris went on laughing with\r\nOffenbach, Schneider, Dupuis & Co., and the _cafés chantants_ were never\r\nfuller, the _premières_ at the theatres never more a matter of serious\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe fatal year 1870 had opened prosperously enough in France. The new\r\nliberal and quasi-constitutional Government under Emile Ollivier was\r\napparently sailing in smooth waters. All of a sudden a storm burst which\r\nwent far towards wrecking the ship. On the 10th of January Prince Pierre\r\nBonaparte was sitting quietly in his library at Auteuil when Messieurs\r\nFonvielle and Victor Noir were announced;—two gentlemen who were editors\r\nor sub-editors of Rochefort’s republican newspaper, the _Marseillaise_.\r\nThey came to call the Prince to account for an article which had appeared\r\nin a Corsican newspaper. The Prince, taken by surprise, pulled out a\r\npistol and shot Victor Noir, while Fonvielle made his escape.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the cry that would be raised among the republicans\r\nby the death of one of their prophets at the hands of a member of the\r\nhated family. It is not so easy to describe the concentrated rage with\r\nwhich Rochefort, that master of vituperation, lashed the Emperor and the\r\nGovernment. The Empress told Lord Lyons that matters would have been\r\nworse “under the old _régime_”; that, however, is hard to believe. What\r\nis strange is that an event which so profoundly stirred all France,\r\nwhich was so pregnant with results, should be so little noticed by the\r\npublicists of to-day. Pierre Bonaparte was acquitted and left France, but\r\nhe had sown the seed of an ineradicable canker.\r\n\r\nFrance was in a state of internal fever; the German was waiting for an\r\nopportunity to spring at her throat; the fates were indeed busy with\r\nthe thread of the Empire’s life. No man felt this more profoundly than\r\nLouis Napoléon—no man was less fitted at that time to deal with such\r\na situation. Older than his years, he was only sixty-two, racked by a\r\ntorturing disease, it seemed easier to him to embark upon a foreign\r\nwar than to face the horrors and the risks of a second _coup d’état_.\r\nThat this latter alternative was inevitable unless the attention of the\r\nBelleville mob could be turned by a cry of patriotism, was manifest. The\r\nwhole influence of the Emperor’s surroundings—including the Empress—was\r\ncast into the balance for war.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1871, after the Commune, the Duc de Persigny, with whom,\r\nwhen he was French Ambassador in London, I had been on intimate terms,\r\ncame to England. I saw him several times at the St. James’s Club, and we\r\nhad much conversation, always about the war and the events that led to\r\nit. Although he was not in office during Emile Ollivier’s premiership,\r\nhe, as one of the Emperor’s oldest and most familiar friends, always had\r\naccess to His Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe told me that, one day, in the late spring of 1870, he went to the\r\nTuileries to pay his respects. He found the Emperor looking ill and\r\ncareworn, and it was not long before His Majesty began to pour out\r\nhis anxieties and fears, asking counsel of his tried and faithful\r\nservant. The Emperor said that nothing was open to him but one of two\r\nalternatives—a foreign war or stern measures of repression at home.\r\nPersigny implored him not to think of a foreign war. The Emperor answered\r\nthat it was easy enough to say that, but what ministry would take office\r\nwith the understanding to “balayer Belleville”—would Persigny himself\r\nform a government with such a programme? The Duke asked for forty-eight\r\nhours in which to consult his friends. The Emperor dismissed him in the\r\nkindest way, apparently much cheered by the hope of avoiding a war, and\r\nbade the Duke come back in forty-eight hours. Persigny did not tell me\r\nwho were the friends with whom he conferred, but he said that he had\r\nno difficulty in obtaining promises of assistance from men who, in his\r\njudgment, would have formed a very strong administration pledged to\r\nthrottle disaffection and all revolutionary conspiracies.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time he went back to the Tuileries; to his amazement he\r\nwas kept in a waiting room for half an hour—he who was always admitted at\r\nonce and never had to _faire antichambre_. When at last he was shown into\r\nthe Emperor’s study he found his Majesty closeted with General Lebœuf.\r\nSeeing this he said: “Sire, I presume that it is useless for me again\r\nto address Your Majesty upon the subject of our conversation of the day\r\nbefore yesterday.” “Effectivement, mon cher, nous avons un peu changé\r\nd’avis,” replied the Emperor, who shook him warmly by the hand, and sent\r\nhim away, resuming his conversation with Lebœuf. I have often wondered\r\nwhether that was the famous interview when Lebœuf assured the Emperor\r\nthat “il n’y a pas un bouton qui manque!”\r\n\r\nPersigny was of course furious; ordinary language was not strong enough\r\nto express his indignation against the people by whom the Emperor was\r\nsurrounded—more especially did he fall foul of the female influence to\r\nwhich he ascribed all the misfortunes of France, culminating in the fall\r\nof the dynasty. I felt very sorry for him; the emotion with which he\r\nspoke was obviously sincere. He loved the Emperor dearly, he was as true\r\nas daylight, and one of the few straight men in that rather pinchbeck\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nIf Persigny has not left behind him a great reputation as statesman and\r\ndiplomatist he was, at any rate, a scrupulously honest man—very different\r\nfrom the crew of Stock Exchange gamblers by whom, to his undoing, Louis\r\nNapoléon was surrounded.\r\n\r\nFrance, then, was determined to go to war, and with Germany. Bismarck\r\nwas of opinion that the French Government thought that the Hohenzollern\r\ncandidature for the throne of Spain was politically a rare opportunity\r\nfor them. They did not believe that in such a cause the rest of Germany\r\nwould stand by Prussia. Such States as Bavaria, Baden, Saxony and others\r\nwould look upon the affair as a simple family concern, affecting only\r\nthe reigning House of Prussia. Why should they spend blood and money to\r\nserve the ambition of a Prince of Hohenzollern? If such were indeed, as\r\nBismarck thought, the prophecies of the French political soothsayers\r\ntheir forecasts did them but little credit. Attack Prussia, and the\r\n_Wacht am Rhein_ was the answer.\r\n\r\nSo much for France. And Prussia? What of her?\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of July, 1870, three men sat round a dinner table at Berlin.\r\nThree notable men; Bismarck, the host, Von Roon, the War Minister, and\r\nthe silent Moltke. All three were profoundly dejected. They could not\r\neat, and their wine was distasteful to them. Bismarck had arrived the\r\nday before, from Varzin on his way to Ems to urge the King to summon\r\nParliament for the purpose of mobilizing the army. For war was in the\r\nair. Indeed, as he drove in his open carriage through Wussow, he saw his\r\nold friend, Pastor Mulert, and answered his kindly greeting with a thrust\r\nof his hand in quart and tierce. The old clergyman took the hint. As he\r\nwas about to leave his carriage to enter his house a sheaf of telegrams\r\nwas put into his hands, informing him of the repeated audiences which\r\nBenedetti, the French Ambassador, had had of the King upon the subject\r\nof the Spanish monarchy. Bismarck was up in arms. He considered that\r\nBenedetti had no justification for thrusting himself upon the King and\r\nignoring the King’s ministers, nor was he pleased that the King should\r\nhave so far lowered himself as to treat directly with Benedetti, and even\r\nlisten to threats. He should have referred him to the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nBut there was worse to come; Bismarck was discussing with the two\r\nsoldiers the propriety of resigning office when a further telegram\r\narrived from the Embassy at Paris, announcing that, in the interests of\r\npeace, the Prince of Hohenzollern had abandoned his candidature. Such a\r\n_kō tou_ to the arrogance of France was more than could be tolerated! To\r\nhaul down the flag in such a fashion would be a shameful thing! While the\r\nthree men were chewing the cud of their misery there arrived the famous\r\ntelegram from Ems, signed by Abeken, who was in attendance upon the King.\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“His Majesty writes to me: ‘Count Benedetti stopped me on the promenade\r\nin order to urge me, in what became a very peremptory fashion, to\r\nauthorize him at once to telegraph that I bound myself for all time never\r\nagain to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should return to their\r\ncandidature. I pointed out to him rather sternly that to give such an\r\nundertaking _à tout jamais_ was what no man ought to or could do. Of\r\ncourse, I told him that I had received no news and that, inasmuch as\r\nhe had been informed from Madrid and Paris sooner than myself, he must\r\nsee that my Government was taking no hand in the game.’ Since then His\r\nMajesty has received a letter from the Prince.\r\n\r\n“Inasmuch as His Majesty had told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting\r\nnews from the Prince, the King, in view of the presumption referred to\r\nabove, acting upon the advice of Count Eulenburg and myself, determined\r\nnot to receive Count Benedetti again but only to inform him through\r\nan aide-de-camp that His Majesty had now received from the Prince the\r\nconfirmation of the news which Benedetti had received from Paris, and\r\nthat he had nothing further to say to the Ambassador. His Majesty\r\nleaves it to Your Excellency to determine whether this new demand of\r\nBenedetti’s and its rejection should be at once communicated to our\r\nEnvoys abroad, as well as to the public press.”\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this dispatch the three men were astounded. The insult\r\nwas flagrant. Bismarck, however, read it again and saw his way clear. He\r\nasked Moltke whether it would be for the advantage of Germany that war\r\nshould take place at once, or be delayed for a while. Moltke’s answer\r\nwas that any delay would be all for the benefit of France. If war there\r\nmust be let it be at once, and he gave his reasons for what he said.\r\nBismarck craftily took advantage of the royal permission to publish the\r\ncontents of the telegram, and in the presence of his two guests he drew\r\nup the communication in the exact terms of Abeken’s telegram with certain\r\nerasures but “without adding or altering a single word.” As edited by\r\nBismarck it ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Since the news of the renunciation of the hereditary Prince of\r\nHohenzollern has been officially communicated by the Spanish Government\r\nto the Imperial French Government the French Ambassador at Ems has\r\nfurther demanded of His Majesty the King that he should authorize him\r\nto telegraph to Paris that His Majesty the King bound himself for all\r\ntime never again to give his consent if the Hohenzollerns should ever\r\nreturn to their candidature. Upon this His Majesty the King refused to\r\nreceive the French Ambassador again, and caused him to be informed by the\r\naide-de-camp in waiting that His Majesty had no further communication to\r\nmake to the Ambassador.”\r\n\r\nBismarck read the _communiqué_ through to his two guests. Moltke,\r\nthe silent, remarked: “That has quite another ring. It sounded like\r\na _chamade_ (a parley). Now it’s like a trumpet call in answer to a\r\nchallenge.” Bismarck said: “If I send this Text, which contains no\r\nalteration in or addition to the telegram, at once, in pursuance of the\r\nroyal command, not only to the newspapers but also by telegraph to all\r\nour representatives abroad, it will be known in Paris before midnight\r\nand will be as a red rag to the French bull, not only on account of its\r\ncontents, but also of the manner of its publication. We must strike,\r\nunless we are prepared to accept the part of having been beaten without a\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n“Success depends essentially upon the impressions which the origin of\r\nthe war creates at home and abroad; it is important that it should be\r\nwe who are attacked, and that is what we shall achieve by the arrogance\r\nand irritability of the French, if we, so far as is possible without the\r\nspeaking trumpet of Parliament, publish to all Europe that we are ready\r\nwithout fear to meet the open threats of France.”\r\n\r\nBismarck’s description of the effect which these words had upon the two\r\ngenerals is striking. All dejection and melancholy had disappeared and\r\ngiven place to such high spirits that he himself was astonished. Their\r\nappetite returned—they began to eat and drink merrily. Roon said: “The\r\nGod of our fathers is still alive and will not allow us to fall into\r\ndisgrace.” Moltke departed so far from his usual indifferent passivity\r\nthat, looking up to the ceiling and for once eschewing his usual measured\r\nlanguage, he struck himself on the breast and said: “If I may still live\r\nto lead our host in such a war, then let the Devil fetch away this old\r\ncarcase as soon as he pleases.”\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the famous telegram from Ems, as Bismarck himself\r\ntells it in his “Gedanken und Erinnerungen,” Vol. II., pp. 104-113.\r\nPopular Edition, 1913. But how characteristically German is von Roon’s\r\nrecognition of the hand of God in the cooking of a telegram!\r\n\r\nA little reflection upon the temper prevailing both in France and in\r\nRussia should, I think, suffice to show that no patching up of the\r\ndifferences between them was possible. The Emperor threatened by anarchy,\r\ntrembling for his dynasty, a drowning man clutching at a straw—and such\r\na straw! Prussia flushed by the successes of 1864 and 1866, ill prepared\r\nto submit to the haughty pin-pricks of the French, and eager to win fresh\r\nlaurels. Who could hope to mediate between them? That is what makes me\r\nthink that Bismarck’s speech about Lord Clarendon was no more than the\r\nexpression of an honest admiration for a statesman whom he held, as is\r\nwell known, in the highest respect. If a little tactless in manner it was\r\nat any rate as noble a tribute as one great statesman ever paid to the\r\nmemory of another.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find two men in greater contrast to one another\r\nthan Prince Bismarck and Lord Clarendon—the one rough and uncouth, caring\r\nlittle for outward observances; the other courtly, polished, dignified,\r\nthe pattern of a high-bred gentleman—yet there was one quality which they\r\nhad in common; both were absolutely frank and honest in discussion; both\r\nscorned those tricks and subterfuges which have given diplomacy a bad\r\nname. Clarendon’s love of truth—even where he had to risk giving offence\r\nin high quarters—was proverbial; so it was that no English minister was\r\nmore highly esteemed at home, better respected abroad. Of the various\r\npositions which he held, of the exalted offices and dignities which he\r\nrefused, his biographer has recorded the sum for the benefit of future\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nSo Lord Clarendon died loved and deeply regretted by all those whose good\r\nfortune had brought them into contact with him—held in honour by every\r\nsovereign and statesman in Europe. At the Foreign Office Lord Granville\r\nruled in his place. No minister ever had to face greater difficulties.\r\nThe Franco-German war at once ravelled all the threads of diplomacy into\r\na tangle of which the intricate confusion was without a parallel, and\r\nthe position became more and more complicated month by month. Prince\r\nGortchakoff who, as I have shown in my account of what took place at St.\r\nPetersburg six years earlier, had made up his mind that he need no longer\r\ntake the opposition of England into account, saw in the discomfiture of\r\nFrance his opportunity for flinging in our faces the Black Sea treaty,\r\nand, in defiance of all engagements, pushing forward into Central Asia,\r\nuntil Russia had advanced perilously near to our Indian frontier with\r\nonly Afghanistan as a buffer state.\r\n\r\nMen have most unjustly blamed Lord Granville for this; but what could\r\nhe do? To threaten when action is impossible is contemptible. England’s\r\narm was not long enough to reach into Central Asia, and where could\r\nRussia be attacked by any puny force that England alone could at that\r\ntime bring to bear upon her? Lord Russell had given England away in\r\n1864. Lord Granville could now do no more than protest, and protest he\r\ndid; but in diplomacy, as in other phases of life, hard words break no\r\nbones. Treaties are good until the strong man armed comes and tears them\r\nto tatters with his mailed fist. Prince Gortchakoff chuckled over the\r\nmisfortunes of France, and felt more than ever convinced that England was\r\na negligible quantity. When eight years later he went to the Congress of\r\nBerlin he had to sing another and a sadder tune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne evening Lord Granville and I were dining together early at the\r\nTravellers’, as we sometimes did when he was in London alone for a night,\r\nin order to go to the French play; all of a sudden, in the middle of\r\ndinner, he turned round to me in a little abrupt way that was peculiarly\r\nhis own and said, “Bertie, it must be a great bore for you to be a\r\nConservative.” I laughed and asked why? “Well, because you always seem\r\nto me to live much more with all of us than with the members of your own\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\nIt was quite true—with few exceptions besides Lord Beaconsfield,\r\nLord George Hamilton and Mr. W. H. Smith, I hardly knew any of the\r\nConservative leaders at all intimately. I had a slight acquaintance\r\nwith them, but Lord Derby, Lord Stanley, Lord Malmesbury, and the other\r\npotentates of the party were to me little more than _magna nomina_. On\r\nthe other hand, Lord Palmerston, Lord Granville, Lord Clarendon, Mr.\r\nCharles Villiers and many more Liberals were most kind friends to me, and\r\nI was much with them both in town and country. No great Conservative lady\r\nof my time had succeeded in having a _salon_. Lady Derby’s parties were\r\nof a dullness as depressing as a London fog; whereas the evenings at Lady\r\nPalmerston’s, Lady Clarendon’s, Lady Granville’s, were gatherings where\r\nwhatever was most brilliant in politics, art, science, literature met\r\ntogether to be gay and merry. There would be repeated a new witticism of\r\nAlfred Montgomery, the last audacious sally of Quin or Bernal Osborne,\r\nthe gossip of the Lobby, a happy Latin quotation by Bob Lowe, perhaps\r\neven some wicked little story from “behind the curtain.”\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that Lord Granville ever made a speech that could be\r\ncalled famous. He was not a master of oratory. But as a leader in the\r\nHouse of Lords he was gifted with a delightful manner, and a genius for\r\nconciliation which made him supremely popular with both friends and\r\nfoes, and which gave him a very real power. In debate he was almost\r\nmatchless. His playful cleverness of fence made him a foeman worthy\r\nof the nimblest steel that could be brought against him. I was not a\r\nmember of the House of Lords in his time, but I used often to attend the\r\ndebates, and I was always lost in admiration of his clever tactics, and\r\nof the masterly skill with which he could disarm an opponent without for\r\none moment condescending to any departure from the strictest rules of the\r\n_salle d’armes_. His delicate sword-play was often more effective than\r\nthe heavy artillery of such a born orator as the Duke of Argyll.\r\n\r\nAs an after-dinner speaker, Lord Granville was quite admirable; no man\r\ncould turn a compliment with a more persuasive grace, and the points of\r\nhis speeches, garnished with anecdotes gathered in intimate converse\r\nwith notable men both at home and abroad, were always telling. Once, as\r\nhe told me, he happened to ask Charles Dickens whom he considered to\r\nbe the best after-dinner speaker of the day. Dickens answered: “Well,\r\nthere are many great orators in England,” and he cited Gladstone, the\r\nDuke of Argyll, Disraeli, John Bright, and others; “but if you want a\r\nreally bright, witty, genial speech for a banquet, commend me to Bishop\r\nWilberforce.” A few days later Lord Granville met the Bishop, and\r\nsuddenly the spirit of fun moved him to put to his right reverend friend\r\nthe same question that he had addressed to Dickens. “Oh,” answered the\r\nBishop, using almost the same words as the great novelist, “Gladstone,\r\nthe Duke of Argyll, Disraeli, John Bright and some others are great\r\nspeakers. But for a charming after-dinner speech give me Charles\r\nDickens.” I should have added the questioner himself.\r\n\r\nLord Granville told me that when Leighton was made President of the Royal\r\nAcademy he consulted him as to the speeches which he should make at the\r\nannual dinner. Lord Granville advised him, since he must have so many\r\ntoasts to propose, to concentrate himself upon one speech and let the\r\nothers be merely formal. Above all, not to be too long. “He did not take\r\nmy advice,” said Lord Granville slyly.\r\n\r\nLeighton was nevertheless a very effective speaker, though his speeches\r\nwere too much laboured. He once told me that he was obliged to write\r\nthem all out and learn them by heart, as the power of “thinking upon\r\nhis legs” had been denied to him. One evening after the banquet, John\r\nBright went up to him and complimented him on his speeches. Leighton in\r\nthanking him asked for the criticism of so great a master, and drove the\r\nquestion home rather persistently. “Well, Sir Frederic, since you ask\r\nme,” said Bright, “don’t you think there is rather much confectionery in\r\nyour oratory—rather sugary, eh?” It was a true criticism; with a little\r\nless ornament Leighton’s speeches would have been well-nigh perfect. What\r\nmade Lord Granville’s short speeches so charming was their freedom from\r\nanything like fulsome adulation; he knew how to pay a compliment without\r\nrendering it valueless by exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe task of an after-dinner speaker is seldom to be argumentative, always\r\nto give pleasure, and in that Lord Granville succeeded to perfection;\r\nnever having had the luck to hear either Dickens or Bishop Wilberforce\r\nmake such a speech, I look upon him as the greatest master of that\r\npeculiar art that I ever listened to. He was so neat and polished, and\r\nhis points went home with such consummate skill, with never a word too\r\nmuch, that the regret was general when he left off, rubbing his hands\r\ntogether—a favourite trick of his when speaking—and sat down. Like\r\nOliver, we wanted more. As a _raconteur_ he was matchless. His store\r\nof anecdotes—never a bad one among them—was as inexhaustible as the\r\nconjuror’s bottle, and in his skilful hands they ran no risk of becoming,\r\nas he warned his children, “a fearful instrument of torture to mankind.”\r\n\r\nAnother feature in his character which endeared him to Englishmen was his\r\nhonest love of sport. Throwing off for the moment the cares of State, he\r\nwould ride straight to hounds, stalk a stag, bring down a rocketer, drive\r\nfour in hand—at one time, if my memory serves me right, he even kept\r\na pack of harriers at Walmer. But his crown of laurels as a sportsman\r\nwas won in 1874, as is recorded in his life by Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice,\r\nwhen the Liberal retiring Cabinet having been taunted by certain people\r\nfor their want of sportsmanlike or athletic prowess, in fact as being\r\n“a pack of muffs,” he threw down the glove. “I am prepared,” he said,\r\n“to challenge the present Ministry to pick their best men and pit them\r\nagainst a like number of the defunct Liberal Government for a ride across\r\ncountry.” As Lord Edmund shows, he had some good men to choose from in\r\nLord Spencer, Lord Halifax and Lord Hartington, all first-rate men to\r\nhounds, besides himself, and we know that he, the old Master of the Royal\r\nBuckhounds, would not have been unworthy of his colleagues. The challenge\r\nled to an amusing correspondence with the gigantic Ward Hunt, a noted\r\n“bruiser” with the Pytchley—“Bright,” wrote Lord Granville to Ward Hunt,\r\n“is no use, he cannot pronounce the name of your hunt.”\r\n\r\nA memorable dinner in Carlton House Terrace celebrated the first Cabinet\r\nmeeting of the new Government, in the Spring of 1880. There was an\r\nevening party afterwards to which I, who had been staying at Walmer\r\nduring the crisis, was invited. The tail was quite a small non-political\r\ngathering, but Count Károlyi, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, was\r\namong the guests. As soon as he came in, Lord Granville took him up to\r\nintroduce him to Mr. Gladstone. It was rather an awkward moment, and one\r\nwhich it needed all the host’s consummate tact to manage.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, during the Midlothian campaign, Mr. Gladstone had said,\r\n“Austria has ever been the unflinching foe of freedom in every country of\r\nEurope. Austria trampled Italy under foot, Austria resisted the unity of\r\nGermany.... Austria has never been the friend even of Slavonic freedom.\r\nAustria did all she could to prevent the creation of Belgium. Austria\r\nnever lifted a finger for the regeneration and constitution of Greece.\r\nThere is not an instance—there is not a spot upon the whole map where\r\nyou can lay your finger and say—there Austria did good.” Such words as\r\nthese had stung and irritated beyond endurance the proud Hungarian noble.\r\nThe only excuse offered was that the speech had been rendered necessary\r\nfor election purposes, but Count Károlyi was not the man to allow the\r\nhonour of his Sovereign and his country to be used as a counter in the\r\nelectioneering game. He was furious, and had declared more than once\r\nthat if he met Mr. Gladstone he should turn his back upon him; he also\r\nthreatened that he would resign his post. Lord Granville smoothed matters\r\nover.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone that evening apologized to Count Károlyi, and a day or two\r\nlater wrote him a letter which the Emperor Francis Joseph characterized\r\nas “the letter of an English gentleman.” At home the letter was bitterly\r\ncriticized. Mr. Gladstone was taunted with having humiliated himself and\r\nhis country also. There were not a few Liberal politicians who joined in\r\nthe strictures passed by Lord George Hamilton and Lord Salisbury.[23]\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Count Károlyi and Mr. Gladstone lasted some\r\nminutes; it was evident that the apology was politely but coldly\r\nreceived. As it was a fine night the Ambassador, with whom I was very\r\nintimate, asked me to walk home with him; he talked of nothing but Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord Granville. For the latter Count Károlyi professed\r\ngreat friendship, and even affection, but from what he said to me then,\r\nand on other occasions, I know that he had been too deeply wounded to\r\nshare the Emperor’s admiration for “the letter of an English gentleman,”\r\nor its author.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only in smoothing the asperities that Mr. Gladstone could,\r\nperhaps, hardly help raising with Foreign Powers that Lord Granville had\r\nto exercise his diplomatic skill. There were not a few rifts within the\r\nLiberal lute which it needed all those gentle and purring ways, that\r\nin his youth had earned for him the name of “Pussie,” to hinder from\r\nwidening. He was by nature essentially the peace-maker, the reconciler.\r\nCabinets do not always, like “birds in their little nests, agree.”\r\n\r\nThey come together upon some one great question, some dominant national\r\ncry—such as Home Rule, Tariff Reform, the upheaval of the Constitution,\r\nand the like. For a while all goes well; but by degrees it becomes\r\nmanifest that here one, there another, Minister has a special axe to\r\ngrind, while there are with no less certainty dearly-beloved colleagues\r\nwho are determined that the edge of that axe shall not be sharpened—nay,\r\nmore, that as many notches shall be beaten into it as possible. The\r\nCabinet of 1880 was no exception to this rule; but what an asset Lord\r\nGranville’s tact and powers of conciliation must have been in the rather\r\ndistracted Downing Street of that time!\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Devonshire told me that when Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice—now\r\nLord Fitzmaurice—asked him to lend his correspondence with Lord Granville\r\nfor the purpose of his biography, there was much which he had to hold\r\nback because it was mainly concerned with keeping the peace between\r\nhimself (the Duke) and a colleague who was then still alive. For such\r\nrevelations the time had not yet come.\r\n\r\nWhen the final crash arrived, when the Liberal camp was divided over the\r\nvexed question of Home Rule, Lord Granville had to sacrifice personal\r\nfeelings and the most affectionate ties of family to the interests of\r\nparty and of political principles which, with him, stood above every\r\nother consideration. The parting of the ways which led him and the Duke\r\nof Devonshire into opposite camps must have been a deep sorrow to him.\r\n“Lord Hartington and I,” he wrote to the Queen in 1880, “have acted in\r\nperfect harmony for the last ten years.” The cleft was bitter to both.\r\n\r\nThere were many other friendships and intimacies which Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nchange of front in regard to Home Rule broke up; none more conspicuous\r\nthan the old alliance which existed between him and his near neighbour\r\nand devoted follower, the Duke of Westminster, and his brother, Lord\r\nRichard Grosvenor, the chief Liberal Whip. On one occasion when I was\r\nstaying with the Duke at Eaton he took me into Bend Or’s stable. The Duke\r\nlooked at the beautiful animal, the hero of the Derby of 1880, and turned\r\nround to me, saying: “He is as superior to every other horse as Gladstone\r\nis to every other statesman.” Within a few months he sold Gladstone’s\r\nportrait by Millais; it irked him to look upon it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no man had more temptations to break with Mr. Gladstone than\r\nLord Granville. He would have slept more softly could he have found it\r\nin his conscience to cast his lot in with the Duke of Devonshire, the\r\nDuke of Argyll, the Duke of Westminster and others, all near and dear\r\nkinsmen, who had fought side by side with him in many a tough fight over\r\na long period of years. In a letter dated July 9th, 1895, the Duke of\r\nArgyll taunted him with the overwhelming value he set on party fidelity.\r\n“I have sometimes asked myself, ‘Is there any conceivable measure that\r\nGranville would _not_ accept rather than split the party?’ and I have\r\nnever been able to answer this question to my own satisfaction.” Lord\r\nGranville’s answer was characteristic. “I could, if I chose, give you\r\ninstances of when I have disagreed with Gladstone, and upon which I may\r\ndisagree with him again; but I am convinced that as long as he remains a\r\npolitical leader he is a _conservative_ power which will not be replaced\r\nby Salisbury, Churchill, or some of the best Whigs.”[24]\r\n\r\nSo Lord Granville and his brother, Mr. Frederick Leveson Gower, remained\r\nfaithful to Mr. Gladstone. We may not all of us agree with the political\r\ncreed which they thus endorsed, and to which they lent all the weight of\r\ntheir great name; but one thing is certain: no two nobler gentlemen ever\r\ntrod the pavement of Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\nPersonally and socially it would be difficult to imagine two men more\r\nwidely apart than Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone. The one a scholar, a\r\nmathematician and a theologian; the very highest expression of an Oxford\r\ncommon room, who, in spite of Eton and Christ Church, never seemed quite\r\nat home in what is commonly called the great world. The other a sportsman\r\nand highly-cultured patrician who would have shone as brilliantly at the\r\nCourt of the _Grand Monarque_ as he did at that of Queen Victoria: a man\r\nwho had acquired all the pliancy which long usage of diplomacy confers,\r\nand who yet, being a man of contrasts, was as firm as adamant where\r\nconscience and political conviction were at stake. From what he conceived\r\nto be his duty he was immovable.\r\n\r\nTo be invited to spend a week-end or three or four days at Walmer, a\r\npleasure which I so often enjoyed, was to see Lord Granville at his\r\nbest—and what a best it was! When, in 1865, he became Lord Warden of\r\nthe Cinque Ports, that ancient dignity of which my own ancestor on\r\nmy mother’s side, Bertram Ashburnham, was the second holder in King\r\nHarold’s time, the old castle was but a poor dwelling-place. Lord\r\nGranville determined to live there, and so, with the help of Mr. Devey,\r\na famous architect of that time, he added to the accommodation, made\r\nmany improvements, and turned it into a most delightful and picturesque\r\nsea-side home.\r\n\r\nNot the least of its attractions was the garden, upon which he lavished\r\nconsummate taste and care. The old place was full of traditions of the\r\nmighty past, full of memories of the great Duke who died there. Even\r\nwhen Lord Granville had added to it, there was but a very small amount\r\nof accommodation. But what of that? It was all the more intimate and\r\nfriendly. I never remember more than two or three guests, except upon\r\none occasion, when the Duke and Duchess of Teck were staying there. Even\r\nthen we only sat down eight at dinner. It was wonderful to see the host\r\nworking away with his red boxes and papers at a little writing-table\r\nin the one small drawing-room which served him as office and study.\r\nSurrounded by his beautiful wife and children—and one would have thought\r\ndistracted by the general conversation—he would toil from morning till\r\nnight, looking up now and then to give utterance to some bright idea,\r\nalways smiling with such a radiantly happy face, even when affairs must\r\nhave been pressing upon him the most heavily, for in office or out of\r\noffice, the leadership of his party in the House of Lords was no trifle.\r\nHis power of abstraction and detachment was wonderful. I look back upon\r\nthose old days at Walmer with a feeling of affectionate regret and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nThough Lord Granville was heart and soul a Liberal, socially he was the\r\nmost fastidious of men. How could it be otherwise with his exquisite\r\ntaste and upbringing, in the midst of all that was the most refined? His\r\ndinners were delightful. His cook, Béguinot, who was at one time with Mr.\r\nFrederick Leveson Gower, was a pearl of great price, and the talk was\r\nalways most exceptionally good.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion to say that conversation died with Sydney Smith,\r\nLuttrell, Rogers and the men of that generation. Those who remember Lord\r\nGranville’s dinners must deny that. At his smaller parties there was\r\nno room for those political Tadpoles and Tapers who contrive to climb\r\ninto Governments, and even, sometimes, into Cabinets, on the shoulders\r\nof bigger men. Talent there was in plenty, but it must be of the best.\r\nTill his death in 1865 Charles Greville, the Clerk of the Council and\r\ndiarist—and his brother Henry, who, also, was the author of most amusing\r\njournals—were pretty frequent guests. Charles Greville indeed—“the\r\nGruncher,” or, as Lord Granville used to call him, “the Lodger”—had rooms\r\non the ground floor of Lord Granville’s house in Bruton Street. He was a\r\ncynic, but a most sagacious man, a patrician to his finger-tips, whose\r\npolitical knowledge was matchless, and there were few difficulties,\r\nwhether social or public, in which he was not consulted. Indeed, his\r\nposition as Clerk of the Council brought him into the most intimate\r\nrelations with politicians of all shades of thought, and he often had to\r\nact as _amicus curiæ_ between opponents. For instance when changes of\r\ngovernment took place he it was who was employed as go-between to carry\r\non such negotiations as might be necessary for the conduct of public\r\nbusiness. That he did not pass through this ordeal without making enemies\r\nis certain. Witness Lord Rosslyn’s lines upon his memoirs:\r\n\r\n    “For forty years he listened at the door,\r\n    He heard some secrets and invented more;\r\n    These he wrote down, and Statesmen, Queens and Kings\r\n    Were all degraded into common things.\r\n    Many are gone, but others still remain\r\n    To whom these memoirs give a needless pain.\r\n    And though they laugh and say, ‘It’s only Greville,’\r\n    They wish his memoirs with him at the Devil.”\r\n\r\nBoth Charles and Henry Greville were old friends of ours, and they\r\nwere very kind to me. I, at least, never had any reason to be alarmed\r\nat either of them as so many men were, for they were both great social\r\npotentates.\r\n\r\nHow brilliant was the talk of the band of men over whom Lord Granville\r\nheld the conductor’s baton! Quin, the famous homeopathic doctor and\r\nwit, was one of the favoured guests; his life had been varied. In 1821,\r\nwhen a mere lad of twenty-two, he had been appointed to go out to St.\r\nHelena as private physician to Napoleon, but the Emperor died before he\r\ncould start, so he set up in his profession at Naples. Afterwards he was\r\nattached to King Leopold. He was, I believe, Hahnemann’s first disciple\r\nin England and was very much the fashion, though more as a man of the\r\nworld than as a doctor. His wit and fun were rather boisterous, but there\r\nwas a deep stratum of wisdom underneath, and he was a valued friend of\r\ngreat men, even among those who laughed at his globules. He it was whom\r\nDisraeli in 1868 persuaded to sound Lord Granville as to the possibility\r\nof their uniting forces. Naturally Lord Granville declined in a very\r\npretty note, but at the same time he paid Quin the compliment of saying\r\nthat no better emissary could have been chosen. If Quin’s chaff was\r\nrather of the sledge-hammer order, that of Alfred Montgomery, enhanced\r\nby a slight stammer, was always delicate and as fine as the edge of a\r\nrazor. Not that it was ever cutting or cruel, though he could rebuke\r\nimpertinence on occasions. His famous answer to Mr. Poole, the tailor,\r\nwas a case in point. Mr. Poole had been sent for to Bradgate to measure\r\nLord Stamford; for reasons which it is needless to revive, Bradgate was\r\nnot quite well looked upon. Alfred happened to go into Poole’s shop when\r\nhe came back and asked him who had been staying at Bradgate. “Oh! a very\r\nmixed lot, sir, a very mixed lot.” “Confound it, Mr. Poole,” was the\r\nanswer, with his captivating stammer, “you could not expect them to be\r\nall t-t-tailors!” “The only thing which I cannot resist is temptation,”\r\nwas shamelessly cribbed by Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nA saying of Alfred’s at Somerset House reminds one of Charles Lamb in the\r\nsame building. One day he arrived at the office (he was a Commissioner\r\nof Inland Revenue), and said plaintively “I think I must take a little\r\nholiday; I have not had one this year!” His colleagues, who knew their\r\nAlfred’s ways, looked at him in amazement, until one of them remembered\r\nthat it was the 1st of January! Alfred Montgomery had been a great friend\r\nof Lord Brougham, d’Orsay, Lady Blessington and the Kensington Gore\r\nset, and he it was who took the news of Brougham’s death to a party at\r\nLady Blessington’s: a sly trick of the ex-Chancellor to find out what\r\nthe newspapers would say of him. Clever as he was, Alfred fell into the\r\ntrap when he received a letter informing him of the sad event! Alfred’s\r\nown little dinners in his tiny house in Chesterfield Street were of the\r\nchoicest—the best of food, the best of wine, the best of welcomes. The\r\nsetting—a picture for a _dilettante_. I wonder whether there is to-day in\r\nLondon a drawing-room of equal size so dainty and so choice. It would\r\nneed the pen of an expert from Christie and Manson’s to describe it.\r\nTo the end of his life he kept his good looks. His features, as finely\r\ncut as those in a classic gem, never changed. I went to see him a day\r\nor two before his death. He could hardly speak, but he was, as always,\r\nbeautifully groomed. As he himself once said to someone who chaffed him\r\non his smart appearance, “I can’t help growing old, but there is no\r\nreason why I should be dirty.” His bed, his dressing-table and all his\r\nbelongings were as smart as a bride’s, and as he lay dying, very tired\r\nand feeble, his humour was as droll and merry as ever—full of fun to the\r\nlast. How few men when they go leave a gap in the great world: in their\r\nown families some are perhaps missed for a while; but outside their own\r\nlittle surroundings it is only the rarest and choicest who are remembered\r\nand lamented. Alfred was one of these.\r\n\r\nOne day Lord Granville, Alfred and I were walking together by the sea\r\nat Walmer. Lord Granville stopped short and said, “Now, Alfred, there’s\r\nnobody here but Bertie and I—do tell us how old you are.” “Don’t ask\r\nme, my dear G-G-G-Granville; I am that most horrible thing, a well\r\np-p-p-preserved man.” As he had been private secretary to Lord Wellesley\r\nwhen he was Viceroy of Ireland, he must then have been pretty well\r\nstricken in years. Well preserved he certainly was—he did not look more\r\nthan sixty.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Reeve, the editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, was another of\r\nthose agreeable diners-out whom Lord Granville made welcome. As a talker\r\nhe had not the light playfulness of those whom I have mentioned, but\r\nlike Delane he had a marvellous memory—a great asset as a corrective in\r\nconversation. Perhaps his greatest claim to fame lies in the editing of\r\nthe memoirs of Charles Greville, who made him his literary executor.\r\n\r\nMany thought that he ought to have allowed more time to pass before\r\npublishing diaries which affected so many people who were still living.\r\nIt must be borne in mind that he was already an old man of sixty-two or\r\nsixty-three when the first volumes appeared, and he might well think that\r\nas the precious papers had been committed to his charge he was bound to\r\nsee that there should be as little risk as possible of their falling\r\ninto the hands of others less discreet than himself.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to call up these ghosts of the old happy days without\r\na passing mention of Henry Calcraft—a much younger man. His power of\r\nrepartee was great, and I once heard him absolutely crush Buckle, the\r\nauthor of the “Civilization,” who had been rather boring a very smart\r\nparty at Baron Lionel de Rothschild’s with one of his interminable\r\nmonologues. Unfortunately it was uttered after the ladies had left the\r\nroom, and cannot be repeated here. To name all the wits and men of mark\r\nwith whom Lord Granville used to salt the somewhat ponderous utterances\r\nof the big political guns and social magnates whom he invited, would fill\r\nmany pages. But however sparkling the talk might be, the host himself was\r\nalways the choragus.\r\n\r\nLord Granville never had but one mission abroad, and that was when he was\r\nsent as special Ambassador to the Coronation of the Emperor Alexander\r\nthe Second in the month of August, 1856. It was in every way a brilliant\r\nEmbassy, Lord and Lady Stafford, she in the zenith of her young beauty,\r\nLord Hartington, Lord Ward, Sir Robert and Lady Emily Peel, Lord Ashley\r\nand others. The Duke of Devonshire had caused his famous collection of\r\ngems to be mounted for Lady Granville’s use, and had placed his plate at\r\nLord Granville’s disposal; the horses and carriages were superb, and so\r\ngreat was the sensation created that it was still alive when I reached\r\nSt. Petersburg, seven years later. The Duc de Morny was the French\r\nrepresentative, and he, too, made a dazzling show. His liveries were\r\ngorgeous, but when someone said that they quite outshone the less gaudy\r\nLeveson Gower footmen, Tutchef said, “Oui c’est vrai—les livrées du Duc\r\nde Morny sont plus belles, mais ce pauvre Lord Granville n’a pas comme\r\nlui les coudées franches. Vous voyez il a eu le malheur d’avoir un père.”\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these tinsel and gewgaw complimentary missions are entrusted\r\nto some peer of moderate, or perhaps no, attainments—that is a matter\r\nof indifference—who is glad to undertake the job and return home with a\r\nribbon and star as an acknowledgment of the discretion with which he has\r\nfulfilled his important task. These are what may be called the carpet\r\nknights of diplomacy. A Foreign Office Clerk is told off to dry-nurse\r\nthem and to see that they are guilty of no compromising incongruities.\r\n\r\nLord Granville’s Embassy was of a very different character. England and\r\nRussia were at peace after the struggle of the Crimean War; but there was\r\nanything but a good feeling between the two governments. The leanings\r\nof Russia were all towards France, and it was a matter of the first\r\nimportance to arrive at a better understanding. The Cabinet determined to\r\nsend out a Cabinet Minister as Ambassador, and, obviously, Lord Granville\r\nwas the man. His knowledge of French—the language chiefly spoken at the\r\nRussian Court—his exquisite discretion, and his authority as a prominent\r\nmember of the Government, were bound to produce the best effect. It was a\r\nhappy choice.\r\n\r\nThere were moments of great difficulty which needed all Lord Granville’s\r\ngreat qualities of tact and temper to tide over. His conversations with\r\nthe Emperor might easily have degenerated into discussions anything but\r\nfriendly. Not for one moment did Lord Granville allow the Tsar to imagine\r\nthat the Queen’s Ambassador could be treated with anything but the\r\nrespect due to the sovereign of whom he was the personal representative;\r\nand yet he knew that if he were to take huff his special Embassy must\r\ncome to an end, and a ridiculous end. His own account of his interviews\r\nwith the Emperor and Prince Gortchakoff is a liberal education in\r\ndiplomatic tactics.[25]\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to any one who may have had the patience to read\r\nthis sketch, that in my judgment the public services rendered by Lord\r\nGranville have not been recognized as they deserved. That was also\r\nthe opinion of my old friend and colleague, Sir Robert Meade, who, as\r\nprivate secretary and Under Secretary of State, had been his confidential\r\nright-hand man for more than a quarter of a century. Sir Robert Meade, a\r\nman of singularly calm and solid judgment, absolutely repudiated the myth\r\nwhich spoke of him as a pleasure-loving man, who sacrificed business to\r\npleasure. Never was a greater mistake. “He enjoyed amusements but never\r\nneglected business.” (Note by Sir R. Meade quoted by Lord Fitzmaurice.)\r\nTo the truth of those words I can myself bear witness.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature in Lord Granville’s character was his power of\r\nself-effacement. Of this he gave evidence on two notable occasions.\r\nThe first was in 1859, when upon the fall of Lord Derby’s Government\r\nthe Queen, tired of the rivalry between Lord Palmerston and Lord John\r\nRussell, with neither of whom she was in sympathy, sent for him and\r\ndesired him to form a Government. He and Lord Clarendon were both of\r\nopinion that, unless he could secure the adhesion of the two, whose\r\nbristles were up at not having been themselves sent for, they would\r\nsooner or later make common cause against him, and so as he put it\r\nhimself in a letter to Lord John Russell, “as soon as I found that I\r\nwas an obstacle instead of a facility towards the formation of a strong\r\nGovernment, I went to the Queen to ask her to excuse me from the task\r\nwhich she had so unexpectedly and so graciously imposed upon me.” It\r\nwas unlucky; for the Queen, having sent for Lord Palmerston, Lord John\r\ninsisted as the price of his co-operation upon having the seals of the\r\nForeign Office, and that was a national misfortune, of which we are at\r\nthis moment (1915) feeling the full effects.[26]\r\n\r\nThe second occasion occurred twenty-one years later. In 1875, Mr.\r\nGladstone announced his matured determination to resign the leadership of\r\nthe Liberal Party. He pleaded that he was tired and that after forty-two\r\nyears of strenuous public life he was entitled to rest from his labours.\r\nHe hinted that more serious interests must occupy the remainder of his\r\nlife. He wished Lord Granville to become the leader of the Liberal Party.\r\nLord Granville declined to play the part of Elisha to his Elijah, but,\r\nafter many discussions, it was agreed that he should lead the party in\r\nthe Lords, and Lord Hartington should be the chief in the Commons.\r\n\r\nLord Granville never for a moment believed that learned theological\r\npolemics with cardinals, the making of his soul, or even the ordering\r\nof the dispositions for his own funeral, would satisfy the magnificent\r\nactivities of that titanic brain. Lord Granville was right. He had gauged\r\nthe situation with unerring instinct. So had Lord Hartington. The latter\r\nfelt acutely the false position in which he was placed; Mr. Gladstone,\r\nalthough no longer leader, was undoubtedly the most dominant power\r\namong the Liberals in the House of Commons, and without a rival when\r\nMr. Disraeli went to the Lords; consistency had never been one of his\r\nmerits, and, as a free lance, he could not but be a thorn in his nominal\r\nleader’s side. His support could never be looked upon as a certainty; at\r\nany moment he might be a hindrance, indirectly in all probability for the\r\nmost part, but perhaps on occasions, as actually happened on Sir Wilfrid\r\nLawson’s amendment to the proposal to call out the reserves in the\r\nTurkish crisis of 1877, an active opponent, voting against his leader.\r\nIt is true that he afterwards “trounced” that extraordinary crank, Sir\r\nWilfrid Lawson,[27] but the mischief was done.\r\n\r\nSome of Mr. Gladstone’s speeches all over the country were of the nature\r\nto create difficulties for his party—or, at least, for its leaders—Lord\r\nHartington was chafing under the irritation, and his correspondence with\r\nLord Granville showed how irksome it was to him to retain a leadership in\r\nthe Commons under conditions which were, to say the least, hampering and\r\ngalling.\r\n\r\nNothing but the rarest and most disinterested public spirit would have\r\nbeen equal to the self-sacrifice that was demanded of him. With what zest\r\nhe must, when occasion served, have drunk in the crisp air of Newmarket\r\nHeath, far from the madding crowd of St. Stephen’s and from those cares\r\nof office without power which are the curse of the “cold shades of\r\nOpposition”—darkened in his case by the incubus of danger from within.\r\n\r\nNo one who was even on the fringe of politics at that time could help\r\nfeeling the greatest respect for Lord Hartington, but that respect must\r\nbe immeasurably enhanced by the publication of the letters in Lord\r\nFitzmaurice’s book. By nature a sportsman, a fine rider to hounds, a\r\ngood shot, keenly interested in racing, delighting in a rubber of whist\r\ntill bridge seduced his affections from the more venerable game,—had he\r\nchosen to lead a life of leisure, his position by birth and by the power\r\nof wealth would have enabled him to have spent his days happily, if\r\nunprofitably, in congenial occupations.\r\n\r\nHe found, however, very early in life that better things were expected of\r\nhim. He still indulged in sport, but only as a pastime. He soon showed\r\nthat he could force himself into great industry, conquering the dullest\r\ndetails of official life. In nothing was his quality better shown than\r\nin the way in which he mastered the intricacies of foreign politics, in\r\nwhich one would hardly have expected so bull-dog an Englishman to be a\r\nproficient, and yet in which, as his letters show, he took the broadest,\r\nsoundest and most comprehensive view. In such questions, indeed, reading\r\nbetween the lines we can see that what he deemed to be for England’s good\r\nwas entirely uninfluenced by party considerations. He was above all a\r\npatriot.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Beaconsfield dissolved Parliament in 1880 and the collapse of\r\nthe Conservative party followed, the Queen sent for Lord Granville. For\r\nthe second time in his life he was invited to become Prime Minister of\r\nEngland; for the second time loyalty to principle bade him refuse. Had\r\nit not been for Mr. Gladstone either Lord Hartington or Lord Granville\r\ncould, without doubt, have formed a strong Liberal Government; but Mr.\r\nGladstone blocked the way; he distinctly refused to serve under either of\r\nthem, and they knew that any Liberal Prime Minister, with the tremendous\r\nshadow of Mr. Gladstone in the background, must ultimately see his\r\nparty shattered after himself enduring the torments of Hades. In such\r\ncircumstances, the reversion of the leadership would be indeed a heritage\r\nof woe. So the two men who had borne the heat and burthen of six years\r\nof Opposition effaced themselves, and Mr. Gladstone once more came into\r\npower. Lord Granville became Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord\r\nHartington went to the India Office, and in 1882 took command at the War\r\nOffice. Lord Hartington’s acceptance of office can only be regarded as a\r\nsublime piece of self-abnegation.\r\n\r\nBetween Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone there was, no doubt, some\r\nmeasure of affection, though I am inclined to think that even in that\r\ncase it was rather prompted by a sense of political expediency and\r\nrespect for the statesman’s powers than by personal love. But Lord\r\nHartington would have been more or less than human, if after those six\r\npenitential years any spark of personal attachment had remained. Nor was\r\nhe altogether a blind admirer of Mr. Gladstone’s oratory. Mr. Forster’s\r\n_mot_ about that is historic: “Mr. Gladstone can persuade most men of\r\nmost things, and himself of anything.” Lord Hartington’s appreciation of\r\nhis speeches was, to my mind, even better: “Mr. Gladstone could never be\r\nmade to understand that people who listen to him and admire his speeches\r\ndon’t necessarily agree with him.” That was exactly the impression\r\nconveyed to my mind by Mr. Gladstone’s marvellous power over language. It\r\nwas my luck later in life to hear some of his most famous speeches;—to\r\nsit on the benches opposite to him when he brought in his last Home Rule\r\nBill. The Niagara of words, the overpowering cataract of eloquence,\r\nstupefied and dismayed, but it did not convince me. In private life his\r\nconversation was amazing. Several times he did me the honour to invite me\r\nto dinner, and I often met him at other great houses; he would attack the\r\nmost abstruse technical subjects in the presence of experts and sometimes\r\nlaid himself open to attack; but on one of those occasions, when he\r\nhad had a rather heated argument with Tyndall, who would not “take a\r\nlicking,” Mrs. Gladstone came to the rescue of her lord and sent a little\r\nslip of paper to his fierce opponent, “We never contradict Mr. G.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n1870\r\n\r\n\r\nThese digressions are, I suppose, inartistic, but the death of Lord\r\nClarendon led me to speak of his successor, and so I have wandered\r\non—carried by memories that will not be denied. Gratefully and reverently\r\nI wish to lay my humble wreath upon Lord Granville’s tomb.\r\n\r\nLet me hark back, then, to 1870. On the 19th of July the storm burst\r\nand war was declared. It is not for me to deal with the story of the\r\ntragedies by which the world was shocked. I only touch upon history where\r\nit is necessary, in order to throw light upon my personal sketches.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer the Prince of Wales invited me to go and\r\nstay with him at Abergeldie. We arrived there, if I remember right, on\r\nthe 11th of August, and I remained among those lovely Scottish mountains\r\nfor nearly a month. It was quite a small, intimate party, for the\r\npicturesque castle has not much accommodation. The romantic tower by the\r\nDeeside is just such an old Scottish stronghold as Sir Walter Scott would\r\nhave loved to describe as the home of a Baron of Bradwardine, standing in\r\na very old-fashioned, unsophisticated garden, bright with late flowers,\r\ndistributed in Scottish fashion among fruit trees and kitchen requisites,\r\nthat it would be a crime to attempt to bring under the rule of a modern\r\ngardener. On a small lawn there was one old tree—a plane, if I remember\r\nright—under which I can still see the great Queen sitting when she came\r\nto drink tea with the Prince and Princess, and insisted on having my\r\nChinese servant, Lin Fu, produced for her to see.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the Prince’s insensibility to fatigue. One night, or\r\nrather in the small hours of the morning, the Prince told me that he\r\nwould be starting for the hill at 8.30 and bade me be ready to go with\r\nhim. Very sleepy I was when Lin Fu came to me at seven o’clock and very\r\nunwilling to get up. However, by 8.30 I had breakfasted and was ready.\r\nNo Prince! 9 o’clock, still no Prince! Another hour and a half’s drowsy\r\nwaiting—at last down His Royal Highness came, full of apologies. For\r\nonce nature had taken her revenge; he had overslept himself. We started\r\noff and had a capital day, the Prince killing a small Royal. We were,\r\nof course, belated, reaching home long after dark, and were met by a\r\nfootman, saying that the Queen had sent for their Royal Highnesses to\r\ndine at Balmoral, and I was to accompany them. The Princess had already\r\nleft, and it was evident that we should be long behind time; however,\r\nwe dressed with lightning speed and drove off. The Queen was already at\r\ndinner. It was rather a trying ordeal for me, but her Majesty was most\r\ngracious and put me at my ease. It was quite a small party; only ten\r\nin all, at a round table, and the conversation was general. Naturally,\r\nthe chief subject was the war. The Queen constantly received letters\r\nfrom the Crown Prince Frederick, which she used to send over to the\r\nPrince of Wales, and he would read them out loud after dinner. They\r\nwere wonderful: the letters of a simple, chivalrous knight, without any\r\nof that spirit of Junkerism which has eaten into the marrow of modern\r\nGermany. He was a hero. And what a grand specimen of humanity he was\r\nthe last time I saw him at one of the royal weddings at Windsor—a noble\r\nfigure, resplendent in his white cuirassier’s uniform, carrying in his\r\nhand the Field-Marshal’s baton, not inherited, not given, but won on many\r\na stricken field of battle. With him the proud old motto: “Allweg gut\r\nzollern” lived.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner everyone in turn was taken up to the Queen for a more\r\nspecial talk. With the others whom she saw daily, the interview was\r\nbrief. She kept me longer. It was soon after the massacre of Christians\r\nat Tientsing, and she was anxious to talk about it. I was able, of\r\ncourse, to tell her a good deal that was outside of what was contained in\r\ndispatches; but her knowledge of those was marvellous.\r\n\r\nAlthough the outbreak had been in the main directed against the Roman\r\nCatholic missionaries, it was quite as much an attack upon M. Fontanier,\r\nthe French Consul, who was one of the victims. I knew him when he was\r\ninterpreter to the French Legation at Peking. Combining piety with\r\nbullying, he was a violent Ultra montane bigot, one of those Christians\r\nwho seek to propagate their cause by methods more really anti-Christian\r\nthan those of what they call “the heathen.” My only wonder had been that\r\nhe was not murdered long before. A man who would prove his Christianity\r\nby kicking over into the mud of Peking the humble stall of a poor old\r\napple-woman, because it stood between the wind and his nobility, was\r\nhardly to be pitied—and of that I was a witness. The poor priests had\r\nin him but a sorry protector, a weak reed to lean upon. The Queen\r\nlistened with great interest. “I am afraid,” she said, “that sometimes\r\nthe missionaries are rather injudicious.” It was a revelation to me\r\nthat in the midst of the pressure of affairs so much nearer home, and\r\nso appallingly important, the Queen should yet have found time to make\r\nherself mistress of the concerns of the Far East. Her memory was amazing,\r\nand it was that most precious quality which made her such a valuable and\r\nsure guide to her ministers in matters of precedent and detail.\r\n\r\nI had been at Balmoral once before, some twelve years earlier, when I\r\nwas staying at Invercauld, and, as usual, the neighbouring lairds and\r\ntheir guests were invited over to a ball. It was fixed in my memory by an\r\nincident trifling in itself, and yet not without interest as showing one\r\nside of the Queen’s character—her great dignity. It was ill attempting\r\nanything like presumption in her presence. A country dance was going on,\r\nin which the Queen took part. There was a certain gentleman present,\r\ndressed in gorgeous Highland array, who, after having had his turn and\r\nmade his bow to her Majesty, cheated, and, instead of taking his proper\r\nplace, tried to win the chance of dancing up to her a second time. The\r\nQueen saw through the trick at once, and when the ambitious dancer came\r\nup to her, stopped dead short and very quietly drawing herself up,\r\npointed to his proper place, and beckoned up the gentleman whose turn\r\nit was. What the foolish man expected to gain it would be hard to say,\r\nbut he was known as a very pushing person, and what he did gain was a\r\nsetting down in the face of the whole company, which must have made him,\r\nas America says, “feel mean.”\r\n\r\nI doubt whether the Prince of Wales was ever more happy than he was in\r\nhis beloved Scottish home, in all the privacy of family life. There were\r\nno foundation stones to be laid, no buildings to be opened, no addresses\r\nfrom chained mayors. He had the best of deer-stalking, the sport of all\r\nothers which he loved, and in the evening a quiet rubber and the music\r\nof the Princess. For two months an ideal existence—broken only by an\r\noccasional visit, an occasional shoot over less familiar moors, a stalk\r\nin a less familiar forest.\r\n\r\nAfter Abergeldie I paid a visit to my old friend and colleague, Lochiel,\r\nat Achnacarry, in a country still full of the mystic romance of the ’45;\r\nwild mountains which echo to the centuries-old skirl of the bagpipes;\r\nscenes that make a man understand the glamour of the old clan feeling\r\nwhich lives in Canada, in Australia, all over the world; traditions which\r\nsend the kilted men to the front where Britain calls, just as in the old\r\ndays they left home and wife and bairns, rushing to the summons of the\r\nfiery cross when the honour of their chieftain was at stake.\r\n\r\nFrom Achnacarry I went to Dunrobin, where I was again to meet the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales, and where I was made welcome with untold kindness\r\nfor many years. When the Dunrobin visit came to an end I went with the\r\nPrince to Polmaize, and later on, in November, was commanded to his\r\nbirthday party at Sandringham.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the year was spent in preparing my “Tales of Old\r\nJapan” for the press. I did not make much by the book, for I sold it to\r\nMessrs. Macmillan for two hundred and forty pounds, and the materials\r\nand illustrations cost me nearly, if not quite, that sum. Still, I\r\ncannot complain; it was as much as they could be expected to give in the\r\ncircumstances, for the subject and I were both new, and it was impossible\r\nto say whether we should catch the fancy of the public. It was a bold\r\nventure on the part of the publishers.\r\n\r\nThe mistake which I made was in selling the copyright out and out. For as\r\nit turned out, the book found favour, many editions were published, and\r\nI believe that it continues to be printed to this day, although the book\r\nfirst appeared forty-four years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander Macmillan was at that time the head of the firm, a man for\r\nwhom I entertained the highest respect and much affection, as I believe\r\ndid all those who had dealings with him; he gave me great encouragement,\r\nand I feel that had that kindly Scot been less brave in accepting the\r\nwork of an unknown man, I might have had some difficulty in bringing out\r\nthe book. It is a satisfaction to know that he was no loser by his gamble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1870 I did no more diplomatic work. I did not resign\r\ndefinitely until 1873, but in 1871 I was appointed once more to St.\r\nPetersburg, and knowing that I could not afford so expensive a post,\r\nI asked to be placed _en disponibilité_, and so became a gentleman at\r\nlarge. I was very sorry when the time came for cutting off my humble\r\nconnection with Downing Street after fourteen very happy years and a\r\nfairly adventurous diplomatic career. There is—or was—in the Diplomatic\r\nService a certain freemasonry, the great advantage of which was the\r\nalmost confidential intimacy to which the younger members were admitted\r\nby the veterans of the profession, who always seemed ready to help in our\r\neducation. I am grateful to their memory for much kindness.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the Foreign Office, among the Princes of Diplomacy who had\r\nlaid down their arms, none could compare as a maker of history with Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe. It sounds a little inept to talk of laying down\r\narms when speaking of a diplomatist, and yet in his case the metaphor\r\nis not so very inappropriate. He had been a fighting man all his life.\r\nHe fought his own Government and made them swallow his policy whole: he\r\nfought the great Tsar Nicholas and we know how that ended: he fought\r\nMentchikoff over the Holy places and beat him as the lion in the legend\r\ndid the unicorn, and the poor unicorn had to run out of the town, give\r\nup diplomacy and take to soldiering in the Crimea, where he was beaten\r\nagain. For half a century Lord Stratford had been always in the lists,\r\nand now he had come home, full of years and full of honour, to pass what\r\nwas left to him of life in rest and peace. A scholar and no mean poet, he\r\nhad at his command the enjoyment of a learned leisure. He was, I think,\r\nthe handsomest old man that I ever saw. He was of middle height, straight\r\nand still active. His features were such as a Pheidias would have loved\r\nto copy. A brow like that of the Olympian Zeus was crowned with silvery\r\nwhite hair; the blue eyes flashed clear and brilliant, his complexion was\r\nas beautiful as that of a young girl.\r\n\r\nAs a chief we used to be told that he held his attachés in awe, but as a\r\nhost he was delightful—his conversation various and full of charm, as,\r\nindeed, how could it fail to be, since he had seen and done so much? When\r\nhis face was in repose the expression was rather stern, and men realized\r\nthe great Eltchi who could dominate feeble sultans, terrify corrupt\r\npashas, and defeat the machinations which were always rife in that hotbed\r\nof intrigue where so much of his life had been spent. I do not know\r\nwhether his answer when he was asked if he had read Kinglake’s “History\r\nof the Crimean War” when it first appeared has ever been printed.\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I have read that romance of which it has pleased Mr.\r\nKinglake to make me the hero.” In what anger would that august brow have\r\nbeen knitted had he been told that the two Powers which, almost at his\r\ndictation, fought in alliance to preserve Constantinople for the Turk,\r\nwould one day be sending their fleets to the Dardanelles in order to\r\nturn that unspeakable reprobate out of doors, and perhaps hand over his\r\ninheritance to the great-grandson of his bitterest foe? Wonderful is the\r\nwhirligig of time! I fancy that we should now read Sir Hamilton Seymour’s\r\ndispatches recording his conversation with the Emperor Nicholas about\r\n“the sick man” with very different feelings from those which they excited\r\nin 1853. The great Tsar’s diagnosis of the invalid’s condition was not\r\nfar out, though the death agony had been long protracted. As the great\r\nLord Salisbury put it, “We backed the wrong horse.”\r\n\r\nSir Hamilton Seymour retired in 1858 and came home for good. His was\r\na great name in the Diplomatic Service and he was in high favour with\r\nQueen Victoria, who asked him what had led him to send in a resignation\r\nwhich she greatly regretted. “Well, Madam,” was the witty answer, “your\r\nMajesty knows that I have kept the Royal Arms for many years abroad,\r\nand so I thought that it was time that I should come home and set up a\r\nfamily hotel of my own.” Genial, witty and charming, everybody liked Sir\r\nHamilton Seymour, and certainly, if he was a loss to the service of which\r\nhe had been one of the chief ornaments, London was a notable winner by\r\nthe change.\r\n\r\nThose were the two great historic envoys to whom we neophytes looked up;\r\nwith them we joined Lord Cowley, of whom I have already spoken, and who\r\nwas still in harness. What a triumvirate! Lord Stratford, the masterful\r\nembodiment of the old Greek definition of a great gentleman, καλός κ’\r\nἀγαθός (beautiful and good); Sir Hamilton Seymour, the man who had calmly\r\nto face the wrath of the Lord of all the Russias—to most men as freezing\r\nas the blizzards of the Ladoga Lake; and Lord Cowley, wise and sagacious,\r\nholding the balance in Paris. At that time there were only two Embassies,\r\nParis and Constantinople, but St. Petersburg, though still only a\r\nLegation, was quite of equal importance.\r\n\r\nAmong the younger members of the Diplomatic Service two were _facile\r\nprincipes_. Julian Fane, brilliant, handsome, accomplished, a poet and\r\nmusician who died young, and Robert Lytton, by whose poetry Sir Thomas\r\nWade—one of the best critics I ever knew—set great store, who had not yet\r\nreached the high offices in which, as Viceroy of India and Ambassador, he\r\nafterwards gained so great distinction. Those two we neophytes worshipped\r\nas demigods—worshipped them with the adoration of lower boys for the\r\ncaptain of the boats and the captain of the eleven. Is there any higher\r\nmeasure of admiration? Morier, who afterwards became famous as Ambassador\r\nin Russia, was junior to these. He was a very able man. Perhaps his\r\ngreatest claim to a niche in the Temple of Fame lay in the jealousy of\r\nBismarck, who recognized in him a dangerous foe, a power to be reckoned\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nTalking recently (1915) with a very eminent foreign ambassador, we\r\ndiscussed these names and others—Lord Lyons and my old chief, Lord\r\nNapier, among them. “Yes,” he said, “in your Diplomatic Service you have\r\nhad a series of very remarkable men.” He was right. To listen to such\r\nmen was the best of schooling; and of these who shall say which was the\r\ngreatest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n1871\r\n\r\nDAMASCUS AND RICHARD BURTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on a lovely morning in the early spring of 1871 that I stood on a\r\nspur of the Antilebanon, the famous “Dome of Victory,” and looked down\r\nupon the plains of Damascus. I must have been close to the very spot\r\nwhere Mahomet—then a poor camel-driver—gazing upon the too-enchanting\r\nscene, resolutely turned his back upon it, saying: “There is but one\r\nparadise, and that is in heaven—there may be no second upon earth.” In\r\nthese days, when men are agnostics in legend as well as in religion, it\r\nis the fashion to assert that he never uttered such words. Why? Is it not\r\nmore likely that he, the man gifted with the seer’s burning imagination,\r\nthe prophet that was to hold the hearts, and order the faith, of\r\ncountless millions for centuries upon centuries, should have spoken thus,\r\nthan that some mean biographer should have coined so lofty and spiritual\r\na thought? Why attempt the impossible? Why try to prove a negative in\r\norder to destroy a lovely legend?\r\n\r\nOut of a fairylike lacework of apricot trees in full blossom the towers\r\nand minarets and cupolas of that “rose-red city, half as old as time”[28]\r\npointed to heaven. Abana and Pharpar were threading their silvery way\r\namong the blushing orchards, as they did when Abraham pitched the tents\r\nof his tribe of wandering Arabs under the shade of the forest trees\r\nfringing the river banks. Small wonder that Naaman the Syrian, when he\r\nthought of his own sweet gardens lapped by these crystal streams, should\r\nhave shuddered at the thought of plunging into the mud of Jordan! Grim\r\nand grey, the walls told of centuries—of tens of centuries—of sacred\r\nhistory and medieval legends, stories of patriarchs, of saints Christian\r\nand saints Mussulman, of steel-clad Crusaders and turbaned Saracen Emirs.\r\nAbove all, closing my eyes, I seemed to realize the vision of Saul,\r\n“breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the\r\nLord,” when the great light “shined round about him,” and he fell to the\r\nearth, stricken blind. Who can look upon Damascus for the first time and\r\nremain unmoved?\r\n\r\nWe had reached this earthly paradise of Mahomet’s, as was fitting,\r\nthrough Purgatory. The ride from Jerusalem northward had been disastrous.\r\n\r\nIt was raining when we struck our tents outside the Joppa Gate of the\r\nHoly City. Day after day the rain came down pitilessly, hopelessly. When\r\nthe rain ceased, snow took its place; we were half frozen and drenched\r\nto the skin, the water made jugs of our boots and the saddles were like\r\nsponges. Our tents were soaked through and our camping-grounds had\r\nbeen quagmires. It was everywhere the same: Gerizim, the mountain of\r\nblessings, was no kinder than Ebal, the mountain of curses. At Nazareth,\r\nwhere we lodged in the monastery, the kind Franciscan monks gave us a\r\npan of charcoal in the hopes that its very inadequate heat might help to\r\ndry our clothes. Worse and worse: the fumes made us very ill, and one of\r\nour party fell down asphyxiated, and for a while looked like death; we\r\ncarried him out into the air, and to our joy a little colour began to\r\ncome into his cheeks.\r\n\r\nOur poor servants! The dragoman and his crew, who tended the horses and\r\nlooked after the baggage, were the picture of misery; the very horses\r\nhung down their heads, dejected and dispirited; and so we went on until\r\nwe were about half a day’s journey from Damascus, when we met a damp\r\nand sympathetic native, who gave us directions as to a route by which\r\nwe should save some distance, and the baggage would join us a little\r\nlater. Alas! We took his advice and the proverbial short cut. We lost\r\nour way, the light began to fail, and we wandered on and on in darkness,\r\nour jaded horses stumbling at every other step over what seemed to be a\r\nbarren, stony desert. There was nothing for it but to dismount and lead\r\nthem. We had no food, and the dragoman was in despair. At last, when it\r\nwas near midnight, we heard the baying of dogs in the distance. There\r\nwas a ray of hope—where there were dogs there would be men of some sort.\r\nWorn out with fatigue and hunger, we struggled on till we came upon the\r\nblack tents of a Bedouin camp. We had heard ugly stories of the tribes\r\nto the east of Jordan, but they must have been set about by the Father\r\nof Lies. Nothing could have been kinder than these nomad Arabs. Even the\r\ndogs, which sniffed about our legs a little suspiciously at first, ended\r\nby being quite friendly. The Sheik gave us shelter in one of his tents,\r\nand told off three or four of his young men to tend our horses, while he\r\nfetched us milk and a sort of damper. Utterly worn out, we lay down in\r\nour sopping clothes on a comfortable litter of dry straw, and in a moment\r\nwere fast asleep. How soon I know not, I was awakened by something warm\r\nand soft and wet snuggling against my cheek—it was the nose of a calf,\r\ntwo days old, which with its mother shared our quarters, or rather, I\r\nshould say, we shared theirs, for we, not they, were the intruders.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came we were the objects of much curiosity: from the\r\nSheik’s own tent there were great whisperings and peepings of his\r\nwomankind. Doubtless our dragoman, after the manner of his guild, had\r\nspent all the wealth of Eastern hyperbole in reciting our magnitudes,\r\nwith which his audience must have felt that our sorry plight was hardly\r\nin harmony. With much gratitude we took leave of the good Sheik, and set\r\nout again through the pitiless rain into the wilderness. Like primitive\r\nwanderers we travelled on, trusting to luck; for many miles we rode\r\nthrough the desolation, without meeting a soul from whom we could gain\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark when once more we heard the barking of dogs, and so\r\nguided, we reached the filthiest village that it ever was my misfortune\r\nto see—Jabat el Hashab, we were told, was its name. It consisted of\r\nsome forty or fifty mud huts, standing in a sea of indescribable dirt\r\nand offal; and in the middle of the village there was a huge heap of\r\nputrid carrion, carcases of sheep, horses and cattle festering in the\r\nmud. A half-naked, ragged, sick-looking creature, who appeared to be a\r\nsort of headman among the fever-stricken inhabitants, came out of one\r\nof the huts and after some parleying with our dragoman assigned to us\r\na lodging for the night. We should have had, perhaps, better quarters\r\nin the caves of the troglodytes. The hut into which we were shown was\r\na sort of apology for a stable or byre. At one end were stalled our\r\nfour horses; at the other end, on a mud platform about a foot high, we\r\nwere to lie carpetless, blanketless. Horses fed on karoub-beans are not\r\nsweet bedfellows; they, combined with the carrion heap, which was just\r\noutside our door, not to speak of the neighing and tramping and the\r\noccasional barking of pariah dogs, made the night hideous. The smell was\r\nappalling—that, with the serried battalions of creatures by which we were\r\nattacked on all sides, murdered sleep.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged on slowly indeed, but when at last daylight broke we\r\nfelt that our troubles were over. The sun, which we had not seen for many\r\ndays, rose gloriously, and we were cheered by the news that four or five\r\nhours’ ride would bring us to Damascus, where we should find our baggage\r\nand cleanliness. And so, forgetting all our very real discomfort and\r\nmisery, we set out in high spirits. The darkest hour which heralds the\r\ndawn was past! But when we met our men, we found that one poor fellow had\r\ndied of cold and exhaustion. It had been really a terrible journey. How\r\noften in after days did I and my two travelling companions, now alas!\r\nboth gone, laugh over the miseries of that foul night!\r\n\r\n“Unpack the boxes swiftly, O dragoman! Let there be no delay! Carry fresh\r\nclothes to the Turkish bath; let us too, like Naaman the Syrian, wash\r\nand be clean.” With joy we cast off the horrible sponges which we had\r\nworn night and day for forty-eight hours. Dirty? Yes, and very densely\r\ncolonized by undesirable aliens. We threw them off with glee, and gave\r\nstrict orders that they should be burned—those orders were probably\r\nnever obeyed; more likely were the wretched rags sold to the local\r\nrepresentatives of the triple-hatted traders of Whitechapel. At any rate\r\nwe saw them no more.\r\n\r\nBut I am treading upon dangerous ground. “Eothen” has been written these\r\nseventy years, and there is no room for any other story of travel in\r\nSyria and the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThe British Consul at Damascus was at that time my old friend Richard\r\nBurton, the famous traveller and linguist, one of the most notable men\r\nof my time. We had become known to one another a dozen years before, when\r\nI was a clerk in the African, or as it was then called, the Slave Trade,\r\nDepartment of the Foreign Office. In 1861 a fight, anthropological,\r\nzoological, and biological, was raging round Du Chaillu’s recently\r\npublished book on equatorial Africa, and especially upon the question\r\nwhether the gorilla was a reality or only a fabulous animal, like the\r\n“men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.”\r\n\r\nAll the great lords of science, such as Sir Roderick Murchison and\r\nSir Richard Owen—who backed Du Chaillu—were in the lists, and Burton,\r\nalways eager for a fray, whether with pen or sword, was on fire to go\r\nand ascertain the truth. He was, however, a captain in the Indian army,\r\nand so long as he remained a soldier the thing was impossible; so he\r\ncontrived to be appointed consul at Fernando Po, severing his connection\r\nwith the authorities of the India Office, who never forgave him. Thus\r\nit was that he had to come to the Slave Trade Department of the Foreign\r\nOffice to be coached up in the recent business of his consulate, and I\r\nwas able to be of some little use to him in supplying him with documents\r\nand information. We became fast friends, I having the greatest admiration\r\nfor him. Indeed, he was a man possessed of a great power of awakening\r\nenthusiasm. He did all that he could to persuade me to go with him to\r\nFernando Po. There was a small office vacant there, which I could easily\r\nhave obtained, but happily my father put his foot down, and I remained\r\nin Downing Street. So far as gorillas were concerned, Burton might as\r\nwell have stayed behind also, for he found none. Du Chaillu, however, was\r\nable to make good all that he had said, and his story was confirmed by a\r\nFrench expedition in the following year.\r\n\r\nBurton, if not a great man, was at any rate a remarkable one; his\r\npersonality was striking; as he strode through the streets with his\r\ncrisp, staccato walk no one could help noticing him. He was not very\r\ntall, probably not more than five feet ten inches, but his frame was that\r\nof a Titan. His broad shoulders and highly-developed chest indicated\r\nstrength beyond the common. Until quite his last years he always looked\r\nlike an athlete in the pink of training. He was the only man that I ever\r\nknew who could fire the old-fashioned elephant-gun from the shoulder\r\nwithout a rest; his powers of endurance were simply marvellous, and\r\nhe could drink brandy with a heroism that would have satisfied Dr.\r\nJohnson.[29] He had a fine, picturesque head, dark hair, burning black\r\neyes and features which would have been handsome but for the lower jaw,\r\nwhich was too strong for beauty, and indeed almost tigerish, with a\r\nferocious expression belying his really kind nature. An accomplished\r\ntraveller, ignorant of fear, and in linguistic achievement almost\r\nrivalling Cardinal Mezzofanti, who could preach in upwards of fifty\r\nlanguages and dialects.\r\n\r\nThere was an article published in _Blackwood’s Magazine_ many years ago,\r\nin which the writer proved to his satisfaction that any man who could\r\nspeak three languages must of necessity be a fool. Burton gave the lie\r\nto that. Cardinal Mezzofanti, on the other hand, does not seem to have\r\nbeen famous for intelligence in any province save that of the polyglot.\r\nIndeed, he was said to be conspicuously stupid, and on one occasion he\r\ngave evidence of his rare knowledge and equally rare ignorance in the\r\nsame breath. On making acquaintance at Venice with the Lord Meath of\r\nhis day, and being told that he was an Irish nobleman, he proceeded\r\nto address him in the Erse tongue, in the full conviction that he was\r\nspeaking to him in the language current in his family.\r\n\r\nAs an official Burton was a failure. He was impatient of any control,\r\nhad no idea of discipline, and as for all conventionalities, he simply\r\nscattered them to the winds. Says Thomas à Kempis: “Nemo secure præest\r\nqui non libenter subest. Nemo secure præcipit nisi qui bene obedire\r\ndidicit.” Burton would never have made a good commander at that rate, but\r\nhe had probably never read the “De Imitatione Christi.”\r\n\r\nAs consul at Damascus he was continually in hot water, and his wife\r\nwas not the woman to make diplomatic relations easier. Her manner with\r\nthe Mohammedans among whom she lived, and whom it was her business to\r\nconciliate so far as in her lay, was detestable. On one occasion I was\r\nwith her and one or two others in a very sacred mosque; a pious Moslem\r\nwas prostrate before the tomb of a holy saint. She did not actually\r\nstrike him with her riding-whip, but she made as though she were going to\r\ndo so, and insisted on the poor man making room for her to go up to the\r\ntomb. What the man muttered I knew not, but I doubt his orisons having\r\ntaken the shape of blessings. I left the mosque in disgust. If actuated\r\nby no higher motive, she should have reflected upon the harm which such\r\nconduct needs must work upon her husband, to whom, to do her justice, she\r\nwas entirely and most touchingly devoted. It is only fair to Burton’s\r\nmemory to show how heavily he was handicapped. He was not responsible\r\nfor all the trouble that led to his removal a few months later from the\r\nromance of the Damascus that he loved, to the deadly dullness of the\r\nTrieste which he hated.\r\n\r\nThe day after we arrived in Damascus Burton came to breakfast. He was\r\nexcellent company, as of old, full of information and good stories of\r\nadventures and stirring scenes in which truth was so richly embroidered\r\nas almost to become fiction. One had to know one’s Burton, for the thing\r\nwhich he loved above all others was to astonish, and for the sake of\r\nthat he would not hesitate to violate the virtue of the pure maiden who\r\ndwells in a well. Take him with a grain of salt, which was quite what he\r\nexpected, and he was the best of boon companions.\r\n\r\nWe were dining together once at the mess of the 2nd Life Guards, the\r\nguests of their then colonel, poor Fred Marshall. The conversation turned\r\nupon feats of swordsmanship, and I happened to tell of the wonderful\r\nskill of the chief executioner at Yedo, whom the dandy young Samurai used\r\nto bribe to test their heavy swords upon the bodies of dead criminals; it\r\nwas said that he could put three corpses one on the top of the other on a\r\ntrestle and cut through the three in the small of the back at one blow;\r\nthis I have heard solemnly averred. “Ah!” said Burton, “it has always\r\nbeen a matter of regret to me that I never quite succeeded in cutting a\r\nman in two. I very nearly did once. I was alone in the desert and saw\r\nthat I was being pursued by three men; my horse was tired and they were\r\ngaining upon me. As the leading man came up with me I drew my sword and\r\ndealt him a furious blow on the shoulder, cutting him slantwise right\r\ndown to the waist; unfortunately I did not cut through the last bit of\r\nskin, so the horse galloped off with half the man’s body hanging over the\r\nsaddle.”\r\n\r\n“And what became of the other two Arabs?” somebody asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh! they made off!” And then Burton winked at me. As for the young\r\nsubalterns, it would be hard to say whether their eyes or their mouths\r\nwere the more open. Burton had dared and done more almost than any man\r\nliving; that, however, was not enough for him. He was compelled to\r\ninvent more. But his little inventions were almost childlike in their\r\ntransparent simplicity.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Burton took me to see Lady Ellenborough. So many stories\r\nhad been told about her and her strange life as the wife of an Arab\r\nchief, that I expected to see a grand and commanding figure living in\r\na sort of tawdry barbarism, something like the Lady Hester Stanhope\r\nof “Eothen,” and Lamartine; an imposing personage, mystic, wonderful,\r\nhalf queen, half sybil—Semiramis and Meg Merrilies rolled into one,\r\nruling by the force of the eye a horde of ignoble, ragged dependants,\r\ntrembling but voracious. No two people could be more unlike. I found\r\nLady Ellenborough—Mrs. Digby, as she now called herself—living in a\r\nEuropean house, furnished, so far, at any rate, as the rooms in which\r\nwe were received were concerned, like those of an English lady; in the\r\ndesert, with the tribe, she would be altogether Arab. Her tables were\r\ncovered with the miniatures, knick-knacks and ornaments indigenous to\r\nMayfair—quite out of tune with Damascus.\r\n\r\nThe owner was like her belongings; a little old-fashioned, a relic of the\r\npalmy days of Almack’s; dressed in quite inconspicuous Paris fashion,\r\nand very nice to look upon, for though past seventy years of age, she\r\nhad the remains of great good looks and the most beautiful and gracious\r\nold-world manners. She had been a fair beauty, but in deference to the\r\nArabs’ superstitious fear of the evil eye, her hair and eyebrows were\r\ndyed black. She was very much interested in hearing about England, and\r\nasked many questions about friends whom she had known in old days. She\r\nseemed to think that the world had stood still since she left it, for\r\nshe spoke of people who, if not dead, were quite old folk, as if they\r\nwere still in the heyday of blooming youth. She asked after the old Lord\r\nClanwilliam—grandfather of the present Earl. How was he? “Wonderful,” I\r\nsaid, “cutting us all out skating at Highclere two or three months ago.”\r\nLady Ellenborough looked puzzled. “But why should he not?” she asked.\r\n“Well!” I answered, “you must remember that he is past seventy years of\r\nage.” “Dear me! is it possible? That handsome young man!” Her old friends\r\nremained in her mind just as she had known them—Lady Palmerston, Lady\r\nJersey, Lady Londonderry—still reigning beauties, queens of Almack’s. It\r\nwas strange to hear a delicately-nurtured English lady talking of her\r\nlife in the desert with “her” tribe. She told us how, the summer before,\r\na hostile tribe had raided them and stolen some of their mares, and\r\nhow, this next summer, they must ride out to avenge the outrage and get\r\nback the lost treasures. There would be fierce fighting, she said, and\r\nshe must be there to nurse the chief should anything happen to him. “In\r\nfact,” she added, “we have one foot in the stirrup, for we must start for\r\nthe desert to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nWe had a long talk, for she was a keen questioner, and then she insisted\r\non taking us to an adjoining paddock to see the horses. There we were\r\njoined by her husband, Sheik Medjwal, the brother of the head of the\r\nclan Mizrab, a branch of the Anazel tribe. The Sheik was not an imposing\r\npersonage—indeed, anything but one’s ideal of a great lord of the desert;\r\nas a matter of fact, he was quite an ordinary, common-looking little man.\r\nNevertheless she seemed very fond and proud of him, and evidently in this\r\nwild, nomad life between the desert and Damascus she had found a happy\r\nhaven of rest after the adventures of her stormy youth. When at last\r\nshe let us go she made me promise to go back to Damascus and visit her\r\nagain. When, after many years, I did go back, poor Lady Ellenborough was\r\nno more. As we came away, I asked Burton whether she was safe with these\r\npeople. He assured me that she was quite secure, if only for the reason\r\nthat she had a few hundreds a year of her own—perhaps £1,500—and that\r\nwas, of course, a fortune for the tribe, and a brevet of safety for her.\r\n\r\nThere was living at Damascus at that time one man whom, above all others,\r\nI was eager to see, and that man was the great Emir Abd el Kader. Burton,\r\nwho knew him well, was able to introduce me to him. Probably to the\r\npresent generation his name is hardly known; but in my boyhood the Arab\r\nchieftain, who from 1832 to 1847 resisted army after army of the French,\r\nwas as famous as Saladin himself. Fearless as the steel of his own\r\nscimitar, the soul of honour, with all the glamour and mystery of the\r\nEast wedded to the chivalry of the West. What a portrait would Sir Walter\r\nScott have painted of him!\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century Algiers was a nest of\r\npirates, the terror of the Mediterranean. When the French remonstrated\r\nin defence of their coral fishers, who were in continual danger of being\r\nrobbed, murdered, or sold as slaves, the Dey haughtily refused to receive\r\ntheir message, and even went so far as to strike their Consul. He had to\r\npay the penalty. But when at last the victorious French were masters of\r\nAlgiers, their work was but half accomplished. The Dey was beaten—the\r\npirate-ships were taken or destroyed—yet in the interior, in the\r\nunmeasurable desert, the wild Arab tribes were gathering to defend their\r\nliberties and independence which they saw threatened by the presence of\r\nthe Giaour on their coast. For centuries they had been under the yoke\r\nfirst of the Romans, then of the Turks. The Ottoman power was now broken,\r\nand they would be no slaves to the hated infidel. The moment for gaining\r\nfreedom had come.\r\n\r\nThere was one man in Mascara, Sidi Muhijeddin, who by his ancient\r\nlineage, his valour and his piety was indicated as the supreme commander.\r\nTo him the united tribes addressed themselves, praying him to raise his\r\nstandard as their leader. He, being then in his seventieth year, pleaded\r\nold age, which would unfit him for the struggle. But he added that his\r\nthird son, a youth of twenty-five, would be the most fitting man for\r\nthe supreme command. This was Abd el Kader, who, young as he was, had\r\nalready earned a reputation for learning, sound judgment and piety, and\r\nto his hands the tribes entrusted their cause. They could not have chosen\r\nbetter, though the ultimate issue was hardly doubtful.\r\n\r\nAbd el Kader was born in 1807 and was educated by his father, whose\r\nposition at the head of a priestly family of princely rank was of the\r\nhighest. In very early life the young man had been forced to take\r\nrefuge in Egypt from the jealousy of the Dey of Algiers, and this led\r\nto his undertaking the pilgrimage to Mecca which gave him the prestige\r\nof the holy title of Hadji. He was but a youngster when, on his return\r\nto his father’s house, he was called upon to face the gigantic task of\r\norganizing the wild children of the desert. It must have needed no small\r\nmeasure of tact and firmness to compose the jealousies of the rival\r\nchiefs over whom he had to play the king; but he had a strong grip, and\r\nhe succeeded so well that for fifteen years he led his undisciplined\r\nhordes against army after army, General after General, that the French\r\nGovernment sent out in the vain attempt to sweep them off the face of the\r\nearth. At first Abd el Kader had but some four hundred horsemen under\r\nhis command, but by degrees his patriotism, his chivalrous valour, and\r\nthe religious fervour of the Hadji, brought recruits in hundreds to his\r\nstandard and he was soon at the head of a mighty army.\r\n\r\nSometimes he won, sometimes he lost; his first great reverse was in\r\n1837, when he was defeated by Marshal Bugeaud (whose fame, so long as\r\nthere is a bugler left in France, will be trumpeted in “La Casquette du\r\nPère Bugeaud”) at the river Taafra; but nobody knew better than Bugeaud\r\nhimself that this was no decisive defeat and so he concluded a treaty\r\nwith the Arab chief which Vallée, the Governor-General of Algiers,\r\npromptly took occasion to violate in a specially insulting manner. Once\r\nmore Abd el Kader drew his sword and the result was continuous warfare\r\nand harassing of the French which lasted for another ten years, until\r\nat last in 1847 Abd el Kader, whose power had been much weakened and\r\nwho was in Morocco, where the Sultan turned against him, surrendered to\r\nGeneral Lamoricière, and there was comparative peace in the land, though\r\nPélissier and St. Arnaud were never allowed to be idle.[30]\r\n\r\nAbd el Kader was sent to France as a prisoner of war. I never saw him\r\nthere; but I can well remember a picturesque group of his captains,\r\ndressed in their long white burnouses, with the camel’s hair fastening\r\nto their flowing white head-dresses, riding in haughty unconcern and\r\nthinking the unfathomable thoughts of Orientals, in the Place de la\r\nConcorde.\r\n\r\nAbd el Kader was sent to France, where he lived, of course, as a\r\nprisoner, but treated with the greatest consideration, until in 1852\r\nLouis Napoléon very generously gave him his liberty with an allowance\r\nof £4,000 a year. He took up his residence first at Broussa and then at\r\nDamascus, where during the Christian massacres of 1860 he played a noble\r\npart, doing all that was in his power to protect the wretched Maronites.\r\nMany a night he slept on the threshold of his house door with his drawn\r\nscimitar by his side, that he, holy Hadji as he was, might be ready to\r\ngive succour and refuge to any hunted infidel who might pass that way.\r\n\r\nFor his services in those troublous times the French Emperor sent him the\r\nGrand Cross of the Legion of Honour; right well had he earned it.\r\n\r\nOne more trait of the generous old hero’s character. When France at the\r\nend of 1870 was bleeding at every pore, the Arabs thought that their\r\nopportunity had come for a rising in Algiers. It was said that Abd el\r\nKader’s son and his people were brewing trouble. This roused the old\r\nman’s wrath; he sent a fierce message to his son, in which he said that\r\nin his youth he had resisted the French with all his might for many\r\nyears. For nearly a quarter of a century now he had been at peace with\r\nthem, and they had treated him as a friend. He would disown any son\r\nof his who might take a mean advantage of their trouble and break the\r\nhonourable peace which he had concluded.\r\n\r\nSpurred by memories of childhood and early youth, I was keen—mad-keen—to\r\nsee that wonderful warrior, a sort of Oriental Garibaldi whose life had\r\nbeen one long romance. We were admitted at rather a shabby entrance door\r\nwith nothing to distinguish it from those of the neighbouring houses—a\r\ndark passage led us into one of those delightful courtyards which are the\r\nchief fascination of an Eastern gentleman’s dwelling. A marble verandah,\r\nwith oleanders in huge tubs placed here and there—in the open space the\r\nmusic of a plashing fountain.\r\n\r\nIn this sunlit court the great Emir received us. He was then a man of\r\nsixty-four years. He was dressed in a white robe in the old Arab fashion,\r\nwith the cord of camel’s hair tied round his head-dress. His beard was\r\nshaved and dyed to resemble that of a young man, his eyebrows were\r\nblackened, and his cheeks were slightly rouged. Before him stood one of\r\nthose X-shaped book-rests inlaid with mother of pearl with which Liberty\r\nhas made us all familiar, and on it rested a scroll in the study of which\r\nhe was deeply engrossed. It was a book on MAGIC! Wonderful still are the\r\nways of the East.\r\n\r\nThe Emir was not a tall man, not more than five feet seven inches or five\r\nfeet eight inches, as I should judge, in height. In his youth he must\r\nhave been singularly handsome, and indeed that was his reputation. Now\r\nin his old age, and in spite of the little sacrifices to vanity of which\r\nI have spoken, he had that rare look of distinction and race which is\r\nperhaps never seen so conspicuously as in the highest type of Oriental\r\nbeauty. His was the figure and expression of a king of men; such must\r\nhave been the Patriarchs, the Prophets, the judges, the kings of Bible\r\nstory. His reception of us was the very poetry of good manners.\r\n\r\nBurton had much conversation with him, for they were good friends. As for\r\nme, after exchanging a few commonplace civilities, Burton interpreting,\r\nI was content to watch and think, and throw my mind back many years and\r\nacross the seas to the desert, drawing pictures of the great gathering of\r\nits children rallying round the standard of the glorious youth who was\r\nto lead them in their vain but noble struggle for faith, independence,\r\nand country. Presently our host, who, as a solitary, was eager for news,\r\nbegan to question me about European affairs, and more especially about\r\nFrance, which at that moment was in a state of chaos more terrible than\r\nat any other period of the great war. He spoke of his former foes with\r\nthat generous sympathy and admiration which we might have expected from\r\nhis chivalrous nature. He even talked of gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of our conversation he clapped his hands and an attendant\r\nappeared, bearing, not as I should have expected, _chibouques_ and\r\ncoffee—but a cup of fragrant tea; such tea as is drunk in Russia and in\r\nChina—never in England.\r\n\r\nWhen we took our leave he thanked us for our visit, which he courteously\r\nsaid had given him great pleasure; and indeed I think it may have\r\ndone; for his questions showed a considerable grip of politics and of\r\nthe convulsion by which the world was being stirred. When he spoke of\r\nthe war, his eye blazed with the fire of battle, and I could not but\r\nfeel how dearly even then he would have loved to lead a charge of his\r\nwhite-cloaked warriors against the Prussian Uhlans. He and his sword\r\nbelonged to the past, his mind was shaped in a mould which the nineteenth\r\ncentury has shivered to atoms and thrown away.\r\n\r\nI had heard much of Abd el Kader, as I have related elsewhere, from the\r\nDuc d’Aumale, that gayest of soldiers and raconteurs, who was never weary\r\nof speaking of him with admiration. I could now fully appreciate the\r\nsympathy of the European conqueror for his fallen Eastern foe; the Duc\r\nd’Aumale, who to his finger-tips felt the poetry of the bivouac fire and\r\nthe rousing crackle of the trumpet, saw in the great Emir the highest\r\nexpression of that patriotic spirit of which he himself gave so royal an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nDamascus, “the eye of the East,” as Julian the apostate called it, could\r\nnever have looked more beautiful than it did on that day when Burton\r\nled me through the old city and took me to see one or two of its famous\r\ninteriors. The great trees draped and garlanded with climbing roses,\r\nthe perfumed groves of oranges and citrons and flowering shrubs, the\r\nsparkle of the sweet waters dancing in the rays of a delicious sunshine,\r\nbanished the dreary memories of sleet and snow and biting winds. It was\r\nindeed a garden city. We went to call upon a friend of Burton’s, one\r\nAbdullah Bey, who lived in an ancient house which in its palmy days must\r\nhave represented all the luxury of the Oriental magnate a set scene for\r\na story like that of the three ladies of Bagdad. Haroun Al Raschid,\r\nwith his Vizier Giafar, and Mesrour the chief of the Eunuchs, must have\r\nknocked at just such a door on that most famous of their nightly rounds.\r\n\r\nI half expected to find the one-eyed calenders seated in the court-yard\r\nwith our host, recounting their strange adventures amid the orange and\r\ncitron trees heavily scented and the oleanders not yet in bloom. The\r\npavement was of marble, the finest Persian tiles set in mosaic decorated\r\nthe walls, rugs, any one of which would be a treasure to a museum, were\r\nstrewn under the arcade of pure white marble, and of course there was\r\nthe gentle tinkling rhythm of a fountain. It was all lovely, luxurious;\r\nthe almost too voluptuous atmosphere of Eastern magnificence—but alas!\r\nall decaying for the lack of a little care and a few piastres’ worth of\r\ncement! It seems to be against the nature of the Turk to repair or even\r\nto maintain. _Kismet_ explains all—where the Turk is there is decay. The\r\nfatalist says, “It is decreed,” and is content.\r\n\r\nThose were delightful days that I spent with Burton in Damascus; there\r\nnever was such another cicerone. We used to wander through the city\r\npenetrating into all sorts of nooks and hidden places unexplored by\r\ntourists; sometimes he would take me to visit some Turkish or Arab\r\nfriend of his, giving me a glimpse of that Oriental life to which only\r\nsuch men as himself, versed in all the mysteries of faith and manners,\r\nhave access. In these he, the man who had accomplished the pilgrimage to\r\nMecca, was of course past master, and the light that he could throw upon\r\nmatters which are riddles to most men, even to old residents among Moslem\r\npeoples, was a revelation.\r\n\r\nIt was when talking upon such subjects that he was at his best. It was\r\nupon his knowledge of ritual and ceremonial that he chiefly relied for\r\nthe success of his venturesome pilgrimage. There are so many nations\r\nprofessing Mohammedanism that an imperfection in language or accent might\r\nbe of small account. But the slightest error in ritual would have led\r\nto immediate detection and death. One such occasion did occur. He was\r\ndetected, but it was not he that was killed. I asked him whether the\r\nstory was true; his answer was: “Well! they do say the man died.” But\r\nthen Burton would delight in making people believe that he had committed\r\na murder. If the tale was true it was a case of his life or that of the\r\nspy. So he was perhaps justified.\r\n\r\nOne morning he came to me with a roll of MSS. under his arm. “There,”\r\nhe said, “you shall have the first sight of this.” It was the first two\r\nor three chapters of his translation of the “Arabian Nights.” He assured\r\nme that he had shown the translation to nobody. Privately printed, it\r\nbrought him in ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nDuring several years after he was appointed to Trieste I saw him but\r\nseldom, and only from time to time when he came home on leave. But in\r\n1890 I spent part of the winter in Algiers, and found myself in the same\r\nhotel with him in Mustapha Supérieur. He was then sadly broken in health,\r\nhaving had some sort of stroke which made it difficult for him to walk;\r\nbut he used to hold a kind of Court every evening in the hall of the\r\nhotel, surrounded by a number of visitors upon whom he could lavish some\r\nof his most amazing tales.\r\n\r\nThere were times when he and I would be alone together, and then he\r\ntalked a great deal about his future prospects and consulted me as to\r\nsending in his resignation and taking his pension. He harped upon this\r\nover and over again.\r\n\r\nAt last one day he brought me a sealed packet, put it into my hands and\r\nsaid: “There! you were the first man to whom nineteen years ago I showed\r\nthe ‘Arabian Nights;’ now you must look at this; no one else has seen\r\nit; keep it under lock and key till you give it back to me.” I took it\r\nupstairs. It was the much talked of “Scented Garden” which Lady Burton\r\nafterwards at his death destroyed. I gave it back to him the next day.\r\n“What do you think of it?” he asked. “Well, my dear Burton, if you really\r\nmean to print that, I should advise you to wait till you have resigned\r\nand secured your pension.” Burton was delighted with the answer. “Yes,”\r\nhe said, with conscious pride, “I think I have shocked Mrs. Grundy this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nIt was the old story! Always the uncontrollable desire to startle and to\r\nshock! There is, or used to be, a club in Paris called “Les Épatants.”\r\nWhat a fitting president of such a club Burton would have made! To\r\n_épater_ was meat and drink to him.\r\n\r\nAfter that winter in Algiers I never saw Burton again. He died a few\r\nmonths afterwards and was buried at Mortlake; where with my friend, Mr.\r\nEdmund Gosse, I visited his tomb last year. He lies buried in the Roman\r\nCatholic cemetery, and his monument is in the shape of an Arab tent\r\nwhich was raised to his memory by his friends. His wife is buried beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give an estimate of Burton’s character; it was a\r\nnetwork of contradictions; even physically, with the torso of a Hercules\r\nand the hands of a young girl, he was a contradiction. Much that he\r\nwrote should never have been written; there is no need to specify; at\r\nthe same time I believe, having good warranty for the belief, that his\r\nlife was morally without stain; he was a model husband, and his wife\r\nadored him; he would proclaim himself an Agnostic, and he died in the\r\nodour of sanctity under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nthe confession to which his wife belonged; he wished to be considered a\r\nsavage, and he was one of the most tender-hearted of men. He was kindness\r\nitself, and to his friends loving, faithful and generous in good service;\r\nbut how angry he would have been if one of those friends had dared to\r\naccuse him of amiability! They would have been pulling down the whole\r\nstructure which he had been at such pains to build up,—they would have\r\nbeen frustrating his lifelong endeavours to prove himself beyond the\r\npale. Only with those who did not know him did he succeed in keeping up\r\nthe imposture.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his marvellous talents and knowledge he did not achieve a\r\nliterary success; nobody could say that Burton was not a scholar in many\r\ntongues; yet strange to say, his books lacked the quality of scholarship\r\nand his English was poor. His talk, on the other hand, infinitely\r\nsuperior to his writing, was learned, various and good to listen to. He\r\nwas an amazing companion. Of all his many books, only the translation of\r\nthe “Arabian Nights” achieved fame and brought in money. For that there\r\nwere adequate if not altogether blameless reasons. As a human document\r\nthe book will live.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce again, more than twenty years later, I was at Damascus. But what a\r\nchange those two decades had wrought! Over the old city, which, when I\r\nfirst knew it, had kept through the centuries so much of the glamour of\r\nthe Biblical and Medieval East, the Philistines had passed the levelling\r\nsteam-roller of the nineteenth century. Turbans and flowing robes had\r\ndisappeared, swept into rag and bone shops. Yellow and scarlet slippers\r\nhad been discarded in favour of infidel patent leather boots with side\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nNo longer did the fragrant fumes of Laodicea[31] cunningly mixed with\r\nspices and apple paste curl up out of the bubbling _narghilehs_ scenting\r\nthe air. The long-stemmed _chibouques_, with their jewelled amber\r\nmouth-pieces, were no more seen, and the _chibouqueji’s_ occupation\r\nwas gone. As in Bond Street, so also in “the Street which is called\r\nStraight,”[32] the cigarette ruled supreme. When the Muezzin—blind lest,\r\nas happened to King David, his impious eyes should fall upon the unveiled\r\nmysteries of an adjoining harem—called the faithful to prayer from his\r\nhigh minaret, it was but a mean, commonplace, tatterdemalion crowd that\r\nassembled to his cry. The prose of the Giaour had banished colour and\r\nromance out of the true believer’s life. I gazed upon the old buildings\r\nand upon the holy places, trying to call up once more the feelings that\r\nthey had awakened in bygone days. But it was all in vain; the charm was\r\nbroken and the spell was gone. The mystic halo which of yore hovered so\r\nhauntingly over the ancient walls had vanished like a ghost into thin\r\nair, and the glory of Damascus had departed.\r\n\r\nOf those remarkable people who had given such an interest to my first\r\nvisit, not one remained. The Burtons were dead, Lady Ellenborough dead,\r\nAbd el Kader dead, and laid with his fathers, far away in Algeria. All\r\ndead! as dead as Abraham and Eliezer of Damascus himself. I felt inclined\r\nto cry with Jeremiah, “Damascus is waxed feeble.... How is the city of\r\npraise not left, the city of my joy!” (Jeremiah, xlix., 24).\r\n\r\nSadly I left the gates, turning the horses’ heads westward towards the\r\nLebanon range, hoping to spend an hour dreaming over the past among the\r\nstately ruins of Baalbek. But there too the sacrilegious profanity of the\r\nnineteenth century had been at work: the Temple of the Sun was strewn\r\nwith sandwich papers, empty bottles bearing the scarlet pyramid which\r\nis the sign manual of Bass, oily sardine-tins, fragments of biscuits,\r\nhalf-smoked cigarettes; all the ugly litter of Ascot Heath on the\r\nSaturday after the race week. I am an old man now, and my travelling\r\ndays are over; but I bless my stars that most of my wanderings were\r\naccomplished while the East was still the East. I am happy to have seen\r\nthe eternal Sphinx and the Great Pyramid—now mere trysting-places for\r\npicnics and flirtations—when they were still wrapped in the mystery of\r\nthe Pharaohs: when men still trembled at the very mention of the Afrits\r\nand Jins who mounted guard over the buried secrets of King Solomon; when\r\nmen by black arts sought to raise the dead and even to summon Shaitan\r\nhimself, robed in all the majesty of terror.\r\n\r\nIt is another East that “calls” now. A thick varnish of sham Western\r\ncivilization has besmirched the picture; its poetry has been wiped out,\r\nand I am content to sit by my fireside, humbly cultivating prose, like\r\nMonsieur Jourdain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n1872\r\n\r\nGARIBALDI\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it possible that I, a child of the nineteenth century, grown old\r\nin the twentieth, ever paid a visit to Ulysses in the Island of\r\nIthaca? Sometimes it seems to me that I did once long ago achieve this\r\nimpossibility—or was it such a dream as fairies in their wanton play send\r\nforth from the ivory gate to mock the children of men?\r\n\r\nIt happened in this wise. In the winter of 1872 the Duke of Sutherland,\r\nBilly Russell[33] and I were at Genoa on our way to Egypt. The Duke was\r\na devoted friend and admirer of Garibaldi and longing to go and take the\r\nold hero by surprise in his island home. We heard that a small coasting\r\nsteamer, a “tramp,” was about to sail for Caprera with provisions, mails\r\nand what-not; so we arranged to go with her, the skipper undertaking\r\nto stop for a while at Caprera and then take us on to Naples, where we\r\ncould join our ship for Alexandria. Our tiny Genoese tramp was a wicked\r\nlittle craft, dirty and foul beyond belief, and with her wheezings and\r\nsnortings, her groanings and creakings, her paddles and engines, quite\r\nout of the Homeric poem. We ought at least to have started on our Odyssey\r\nin a felucca with a lateen sail; but we needs must be content to tempt\r\nthe rather treacherous sea prosaically, but in comparative certainty of\r\nreaching our destination.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely February morning which, after a night of poisonous\r\nsmells, some oily, some pungent, all unutterable, revealed the strip of\r\nyellow beach which fringes the storm-beaten island rocks. It did not\r\ntake long to get out a gig, and nothing loth to be quit of our rather\r\npestilential surroundings, we hurried ashore. The Duke, eager to shake\r\nhis friend by the hand, almost ran up the few hundred yards of rock and\r\nscrub which led to the house. Billy and I, who did not know the General,\r\nand who were more or less in the position of the two gentlemen at the\r\nfeast of Nasidienus “quas Mæcenas adduxerat umbras,” were discreet and\r\nmore leisurely.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the house we found the two friends radiantly happy in one\r\nanother’s company, surrounded by a motley crew of secretaries, followers\r\nand nondescripts who had attached themselves to the great man’s service,\r\nand apparently lived with him and upon him. They seemed to be a ragged,\r\nhappy, devil-may-care crowd, with very simple wants—a blanket or cloak on\r\nthe floor; a little polenta; a goblet of wine hardly better than coloured\r\nwater; one of those long, thin, curly cigars with a straw in it, made all\r\nthe more rank and malodorous by being let out, stuffed into a pocket or\r\nhat-band, and lighted again as desire might prompt. These were sufficient\r\nto make happiness so far as lodging and creature comforts were concerned;\r\nof washing, the less said the better. Full of fun, good humour, high\r\nspirits they were, and of a truly Italian wealth of gesticulation. The\r\nhouse was humble enough. Little better than a farmhouse, with no attempt\r\nat ornament, no vestige of luxury—the unpretentious home of a gentleman\r\nfarmer. I could not help thinking of the contrast which must have struck\r\nGaribaldi when, after his royal progress through London, he was received\r\nby Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, that most regal of dames, standing in\r\nall her glory on the staircase at Stafford House.\r\n\r\nBut his soul was utterly simple and devoid of any love of show or\r\nostentation; the presence of anything of the nature of pomp or\r\nglorification excited no emotion in him, while the absence of it raised\r\nno regret. Italy would have given him anything. He might have lived\r\nluxuriously in a palace in Rome, Genoa or Naples. He preferred his rock,\r\nthe humble homestead which he shared with those who loved him, satisfied\r\nwith little beyond the scanty fare which his island could yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI.]\r\n\r\nGaribaldi received Billy and me with the gentlest courtesy; indeed\r\ngentleness seemed to be the keynote of his character; this wonderful man,\r\nwhom those who knew him not were wont to look upon as a revolutionary\r\nfirebrand, had all the sweet tenderness of a woman, and yet there was\r\nnothing effeminate about him, nothing weak or puny; when you spoke\r\nwith Garibaldi you felt that you were talking with a man. It was the\r\ncombination of this sympathetic kindness with the stern determination of\r\nthe born fighter that made him so irresistible as a leader, such a king\r\namong men. As for me, when he turned those clear, honest eyes of his upon\r\nme, I was under the spell, like everybody else. But when I listened to\r\nthe liquid music of his voice I was his slave.\r\n\r\nHow handsome he was! I have a coloured engraved portrait of him, a cheap\r\nthing, but very precious to me, because of the inscription signed by him,\r\n“Al signor Mitford la mia amicizia se vuol gradirla”—a cheap thing, but\r\nso like. Long, fair hair, with a curling wave in it, just turning grey;\r\nthe fine complexion which none of his campaigns, none of his seafaring\r\nhad been able to spoil; the clearly-cut features and the soft, almost\r\nwomanly eyes. A cheap thing, but a Velasquez could not have given a more\r\nliving picture of the man. When I saw him he was dressed in the familiar\r\ngarb—the scarlet shirt, the grey flannel trousers; a lanyard round his\r\nneck and a black silk kerchief tied in a sailor’s knot. No star, no\r\ndecoration; nothing to mark him as something above the humble folk by\r\nwhom he was surrounded, save that inborn distinction which, had he been\r\nin rags, would not have forsaken him.\r\n\r\nFor a while we loitered about the outside of the house, while a\r\ncopious and most hospitable breakfast was being prepared. The famous\r\nFrancesca—the Penelope of Caprera—Garibaldi’s third wife, a peasant woman\r\nwho had been nurse to his grandchild—must have been taken aback by the\r\nadvent of three hungry Englishmen, for whom the possibilities of the\r\ntramp had meant something very like starvation for many hours; but she\r\nrose to the occasion and no guests were ever made more welcome. Meanwhile\r\nwe took notice of the surroundings; no pleasure garden, nothing of what\r\nare called by dealers in houses “the amenities.”\r\n\r\nOne thing I did mark—a huge dog-kennel; what would Ulysses, what would\r\nIthaca be, without a dog? And on the dog-kennel some wicked wag had\r\nexpressed his anti-papal convictions by painting upon it in huge white\r\nletters “CASA DI PIO NONO.” This jest, cruel if it had not been so\r\nbabyish, was none of Garibaldi’s doing—indeed, he probably never saw it,\r\nfor, crippled as he was with rheumatism, a confirmed invalid, and very\r\nlame from the old wound in the foot which was shot through at Aspromonte,\r\nhe moved about very little; but the fanatic hatred which his unruly\r\nfollowers showed to the Pope and the whole ecclesiastical body of the\r\nNeri was quite irrepressible. He, if the truth must be told, shared their\r\nviews, witness his book “Clelia, ovvero il Regno del Monaco,” but he\r\nlaughed at their childish ways of expressing their hatred.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon—or breakfast—we found that such luggage as we had need of\r\nwas piled up outside the house, and on the top of it lay Billy Russell’s\r\nrifle-case. When Garibaldi saw it, he asked Billy whether he would like\r\nto go off for an afternoon’s sport. He would find the island overrun with\r\nwild goats, from which indeed it took its name, and if he was in luck\r\nmight get a shot at a wild donkey. Years ago some donkeys had been turned\r\nloose and had bred and multiplied, so that ass-stalking had now become a\r\nchief sport of the island. Billy was delighted, unpacked the case and put\r\ntogether the rifle, which became the object of the most eager curiosity\r\non the part of the secretary and the other retainers. They petted it and\r\npatted it and stroked it as lovers, with the unctuous pleasure that a\r\ncompany of fiddlers might feel in caressing the back and belly of a rare\r\nCremona violin. They prayed that before he started its owner would allow\r\nthem to try it. Of course he consented, a target of some sort was quickly\r\nrigged up, and the secretary had the first shot. He made a bull’s eye.\r\n“Un prete!” he shouted with lusty joy—a priest! The others caught up the\r\ncry, and when they took their turn with the rifle, each successful shot\r\nwas hailed with the same exultant applause, “Un prete! un prete! ancora\r\nun prete!” Garibaldi, who was standing by, shrugged his shoulders, and,\r\nturning to me with a smile, said, “Sont-ils assez enfants?” They really\r\nwere like children, rather naughty children, whose naughtiness is often\r\nso amusing that their elders cannot help laughing with, not at, them.\r\n\r\nSo Billy went off shouldering his rifle, as keen as a boy, burning to\r\nstalk a jackass or bring down a goat. I wonder whether anywhere else in\r\nEurope there exists such a sport; in Caprera itself, since the Italian\r\nGovernment has purchased the island, it is probably by this time a thing\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARIBALDI’S INSCRIPTION FOR THE PRINT OF HIS PORTRAIT\r\nWHICH HE PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR]\r\n\r\nWhen our sportsman had gone, Garibaldi took me by the arm and hobbled up\r\nand down with me on the path which made a sort of quarterdeck in front of\r\nthe house. He talked a great deal about England, for which he entertained\r\na sincere admiration and affection. He asked many questions about the\r\nvarious people whom he had known there—questions which he felt that he\r\ncould put to me more discreetly than to the Duke, for many of his friends\r\nhad been among the Duke’s nearest relations—his mother, his brothers and\r\nsisters. Suddenly he turned round and said: “Is it true—is it possible\r\nthat it can be true—that there are actually in England people who are\r\ndesirous of abolishing the existing order of things and setting up a\r\nrepublic in the place of your monarchy?” I said that there certainly were\r\na few people who seemed to think that to do away with the monarchy and\r\nthe aristocracy and to set up a republic was the panacea for all human\r\nills. “They must be fools!” he said, and then went on very earnestly:\r\n“Why, in England you have the finest form of government in the world—a\r\nrepublic of which the President rules by the will of the people, and\r\nbeing hereditary depends upon no political cry of the moment. With you\r\nby virtue of this hereditary principle there is not the continual danger\r\nof someone saying ‘Ôte-toi de là que je m’y mette’—and so no perpetual\r\nrisk of upheavals. I only wish that I could see Italy blessed with such a\r\nrepublic; then I should be quite content.”\r\n\r\nI thought this speech, coming from the man who was pointed at as the\r\nincarnation of rebellion and anarchy, not a little remarkable. I can\r\nhear him uttering it now, and can see the eager, beautiful eyes looking\r\nthrough and through me as he spoke. Whatever Garibaldi said struck home,\r\nhe was so obviously and entirely sincere; his voice was the voice of\r\ntruth. We were talking in this way for a couple of hours or more, and\r\nafter the lapse of more than forty years, some of his very words are yet\r\nringing in my ears. England and Italy were the subjects upon which he\r\nso fondly dwelt. He spoke much of the unification of Italy, of Italia\r\nirredenta, and very modestly, very reticently, of the part which he had\r\nplayed. He said: “There are many people who will tell you that Italy as\r\nshe now is was the work of Victor Emmanuel and Cavour, others give the\r\ncredit to Louis Napoléon, some even ascribe it to me. The truth is that\r\nno one man, no two men, can claim the merit. We all of us had a hand in\r\nit, we did our best and we succeeded.”\r\n\r\nGaribaldi evidently had much sympathy with and admiration for Victor\r\nEmmanuel, the Re Galantuomo whose bluff, soldierlike, sportsman’s nature\r\ncould not but appeal to him; with the wily, albeit successful, diplomacy\r\nof Cavour he would naturally be less in accord, nor indeed did Cavour\r\nbehave generously to him or to his devoted soldiers, whom he refused to\r\nincorporate in the army; but against Rattazzi his case was even stronger;\r\nled on and encouraged by that statesman’s Machiavellian wiles he was\r\nfinally betrayed and the result was Aspromonte, when to their everlasting\r\nshame the soldiers of Italy fired upon their liberator.\r\n\r\nStill, in speaking even of these men he uttered no complaint, gave\r\nno sign of bearing a grudge. He was far too noble for that. That\r\nhe would fight all men knew, if there should be good cause, but to\r\nrail at an enemy, even at that worst form of enemy, the enemy in the\r\ncamp, was not in his nature. I am often asked what it was that most\r\nimpressed me in Garibaldi. The keynote of his character seemed to be\r\nsimplicity—simplicity combined with great dignity. There was about him\r\nnothing of the _condottiere_, none of the swagger of the free-lance.\r\nA spice and no more of Don Quixote; but we must remember that the Don\r\nhimself was a great gentleman, brave and tender and generous as a\r\ngentleman should be.\r\n\r\nAt dusk our sportsman came home; very tired after a long clamber over\r\ngranite rock and fell, through scrub and brush of myrtle, juniper and\r\nsweet-smelling bushes, without having seen the horn of a goat or the ear\r\nof a jackass. He brought back a very unseductive account of the little\r\nisland. Garibaldi’s kingdom was a Lilliput about six miles long by two\r\nbroad; the highest Alp about seven hundred feet above the sea level; not\r\na river or even a brook to be seen. Had there not been delicious springs\r\nand a few puddles, life would have been impossible for man or beast. Just\r\na barren rocky waste, a most inhospitable wilderness. Scanty cultivation\r\nand few hands to work, had there been work for them; a dreary home\r\nenough; but bare as it was, Garibaldi loved it, and it said more to his\r\nheart than the Garden of the Hesperides with its golden fruit.\r\n\r\nAs the day waned our surroundings became more and more Homeric. When the\r\nevening meal came, supper or dinner, we were really in Ithaca—Ulysses,\r\nwe three Englishmen, the secretary and a chosen retainer or two were\r\ngathered together in a long, narrow room, with dark wooden wainscot and a\r\nwhitewashed ceiling, much besmoked.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the room and on one side of it were wooden benches; the\r\ntable was shaped like the room, and we sat round it in chairs. Presently\r\na huge, smoking dish was brought in; a roasted kid, with vegetables, and\r\nvery good it was. As we sat, curious, wild-looking beings, hinds fresh\r\nfrom their labours, whatever they might be, with faces so brown that\r\nthey were hardly distinguishable from the woodwork, came in one by one\r\nand sat down in silence upon the benches against the walls to watch the\r\nchieftain and his guests eat. There they remained, smoking and scratching\r\nthemselves, till the end of the evening, by which time the room was so\r\nbefogged that it was difficult to see anything. Penelope, who was busy\r\nwith her hospitable duties and the preparation of an excellent _risotto_,\r\nand other cates, did not sup with us, but came in afterwards, and sat\r\ndown at the table caressingly near to her great husband. Dressed like a\r\nsimple villager, she was not beautiful, but a good, honest woman of the\r\npeasant class, evidently worshipping the hero to the comforting of whose\r\nfading years she had devoted her humble life.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sensation to sit there supping under the wondering\r\neyes of those mute peasants, much as the Kings of France used to eat,\r\nwatched by their subjects. The interest to these good men must have been\r\nbut meagre, for the conversation was in French, of which they had not\r\nthe gift. From time to time one or another of them would march out as\r\nsilently as he had come in, unnoticing and unnoticed, but some of them\r\nremained with us to the end, when there must have been about half a\r\ndozen left. We sat on and on, later than we should have done had not the\r\nskipper of the tramp sent up word to say that he begged us to leave early\r\nin the morning, otherwise he could not guarantee landing us at Naples in\r\ntime to catch our steamer for Alexandria.\r\n\r\nSo we stayed, luring our host on to talk of old times, of his many\r\nmoving accidents by flood and field, of his ambitions—not for himself,\r\nbut for his country—of the hopes realized and the hopes wrecked. Here\r\nagain I was struck by his generosity. His dislike of Louis Napoléon was a\r\nmatter of common knowledge, but when we talked of France and her recent\r\nmisfortunes, for “greatness once fallen out with fortune” he had nothing\r\nbut sympathy; in that very unlike some of the Emperor’s own men, whose\r\ntalk was apt to press with heavy ingratitude upon the stricken Lion.\r\n\r\nOur symposium was so agreeable that it seemed a pity to break it up; it\r\nwas good to listen to Billy Russell and Garibaldi, the former one of\r\nthe best of talkers, the latter evidently delighted once more to have a\r\nglimpse into a larger world than that of his tiny domain. The Duke and I\r\nwere content to sit and hear, until at last we felt that the grand old\r\nGeneral, an invalid at best, must not be allowed to keep from his rest.\r\n\r\nThe room which I was to occupy was a long, low, narrow sort of\r\nstore-room, at one end of which was a basin and a ewer of water, and\r\nthe invalid arm-chair of green leather framed in iron, now grown rather\r\nrickety, the present for which the ladies of England subscribed when\r\ntheir idol was wounded at Aspromonte. That was to be my bed. The floor\r\nand all the various odds and ends in the room were covered with a rich\r\ncoat of dust. It was plain that Penelope and her handmaidens, if she\r\nhad any, had been too busy in the kitchen to pay any attention to such\r\ndetails as the sweeping of a makeshift bedroom. I could have written my\r\nname in large letters anywhere upon any scrap of furniture. But when I\r\nput out my candle, hoping to sleep, then I realized I was not alone.\r\nThe dust was literally full of fleas; they attacked me in battalions; I\r\nslew them by the score, but their widows and orphans and brothers came\r\non undismayed, undefeated, to avenge their deaths. Never save once, in\r\nthe cave of the Seven Sleepers at Ephesus, where I had taken refuge from\r\na storm, did I see such an army of hungry cohorts. I tried to comfort\r\nmyself by thinking of Eothen’s famous chapter and Thackeray’s “White\r\nSquall,” when,\r\n\r\n    “All the fleas in Jewry\r\n    Began to bite like fury”—\r\n\r\nbut it was all in vain. I prayed for the morning, which was long in\r\ncoming. When at last I did arise and once more gripped Garibaldi’s\r\nhand, the miseries of the night were forgotten in the thought, that to\r\nme, humble as I was, it had been given for a few short hours to be in\r\nsympathetic touch with one of those rare beings whom God, for His own\r\npurposes, had anointed to be above his fellows. But it was sad to think\r\nthat this all too short visit, this happy experience, must fade into the\r\nmist of memory like a dream, but not a dream sent out of those ivory\r\ngates of which I spoke a while ago, but a dream from out of the horn\r\ngates, a dream true and real, a very precious dream to be treasured for\r\nall time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n1873\r\n\r\nWESTWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Russia_ (Captain Cook), the crack ship of the Cunard line which\r\ncarried me to America in the month of March, 1873, would not find much\r\ngrace in the eyes of the rich men who brave the dangers of the sea in\r\nwhat are called “the floating palaces” of this twentieth century. There\r\nwere no conservatories, no swimming-bath, no marble architecture. On\r\nthe other hand, there was a greater sense of security. I have sailed in\r\none of these giant modern liners many stories (not decks!) high, and\r\nI confess to having been appalled at the thought of what must be the\r\nconfusion in a panic on board a labyrinthine ship where a silken clue\r\nis needed, even in a calm, to find the way to the dining-saloon. Oliver\r\nMontagu, who afterwards commanded the Blues, was my travelling companion.\r\nWe spent ten delightful days in New York, forced to leave it all too\r\nquickly, but carrying away with us memories of lavish hospitality and\r\nkindness, busy, eager men, dainty dames and damsels, the preciousness of\r\nwhose beauty would have adorned far less gorgeous apparel than what they\r\nwere clad in; abundance of worldly goods, fine jewels, and a profusion of\r\nflowers thrown out as a defiance to climate.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that seemed lacking at that time was any expression of the\r\nhighest forms of art. The Pierpont Morgans, Wideners, Fricks and others\r\nhave long since filled up that gap. But of the glories of New York it is\r\nnot for me to speak here. Our business there was to have what New York\r\nitself calls a “lovely time”; that was _our_ business, and the kindness\r\nof other people made it _their_ pleasure. The objects of our journey lay\r\nfarther afield, and so we followed Horace Greely’s famous bit of advice,\r\n“Go West, young man, go West!”\r\n\r\nOn board the _Russia_ we had made friends with one of our shipmates,\r\nTom Nickalls, a very leading member of the Stock Exchange, a first-rate\r\nsportsman and cheery companion, and he joined us in our expedition into\r\nthe Wilds. As a child he had known Chicago, which we were anxious to see;\r\nhe had still some friends or connections there, and it did not take much\r\npersuasion on his part to induce us to call a halt.\r\n\r\nThe resurrection of Chicago was certainly the most colossal achievement\r\nof human endeavour that ever I witnessed. It was on the 8th of October,\r\n1871, if the legend be true, that Biddy Maloney’s cow, whisking her tail,\r\nupset a lamp in a wooden shed in de Koven Street and started the great\r\nfire. A fierce wind was blowing from the west, a long, hot summer had\r\ndried into tinder the wooden buildings and lumber yards, and in a few\r\nminutes the flames were raging beyond the power of man to control them.\r\nBetween that Sunday night and Tuesday morning an area of nearly three\r\nand a third square miles was reduced to a heap of ashes. The winter was\r\nnear when building would be impossible. The most that could be done was\r\nthe work of clearance. Then, from the four winds of heaven, were blown\r\nbuilders, carpenters, masons, bricklayers, glaziers. The statistics of\r\nthe building that began the first day that the frost was out of the\r\nground, the 15th of April, 1872, and ended on the 1st of December of the\r\nsame year, are simply amazing.\r\n\r\nExcluding Sundays and counting two hundred working days, it was computed\r\nthat for each hour of each day of eight hours there was completed one\r\nbrick, stone or iron building of twenty-five feet frontage and from four\r\nto six stories high. Was such a thing possible? Well, we arrived in the\r\nspring of 1873, before the new building season was in full blast, and we\r\nsaw those buildings—that miracle—the Phœnix risen from its ashes.\r\n\r\nWhen we had all taken our places in the omnibus and were just moving off,\r\nbound for St. Louis, a rough man got in, carrying a small carpet bag—all\r\nhis luggage. “Whar does this hyar conveyance connect?” he asked. “It’s\r\nbound for the St. Louis train.” “Waal! that’s not my road, but I guess\r\nit don’t much signify.” “Why, where are you going to?” “Waal! I guess I’m\r\nbound to go to the end of the rope, anyways,” said the man, changing his\r\nquid with the utmost unconcern. There you have the true pioneer spirit\r\nof America which opens up and fertilizes the limitless wilderness. Men\r\nsuch as this who started years ago, without plan or prospect, “bound to\r\ngo to the end of the rope,” are now rolling in wealth, lords of countless\r\nherds, exporters of grain, owners of rich mines, lumber kings, what not?\r\nStrong thews and sinews, but above all a stout heart, must these men\r\nhave. Only think of what is implied by “the end of the rope.” No house\r\nto live in, no friend, perhaps not even a dog, to speak to; food coarse\r\nand often scanty; exposure by day and by night to sun and rain, wind,\r\nsnow and frost; cattle straying or attacked by wild beasts; thieving,\r\nmurdering and scalping Indians; a life of peril and exhausting labour; a\r\ncutting of all home-ties; a dearth of all home news; fever and sickness\r\nuntended and uncared for. That is “the end of the rope.” Who shall say\r\nthat the man who succeeds—the survival of the fittest—has not earned his\r\nsuccess? But how many are bound to go under?\r\n\r\nThere was a very pleasant American gentleman in the same carriage with\r\nus, with whom we made good friends. I had by that time learned enough of\r\nthe American language to say, offering him a cigar, “Do you use tobacco,\r\nsir?” “Yes, sir,” he replied, politely accepting the offer, “I do. For I\r\nsmoke and I snuff and I chew; and if it had pleased Heaven to decree that\r\nthere should be a fourth way of using tobacco, I guess I should have used\r\nit that way also.” It is always comforting to see such respect paid to\r\nthe decrees of Heaven.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis is, as cities go in America, quite venerable. Founded by the\r\nLouisiana Fur Company in 1764, it was just ninety-nine years old at\r\nthe time of our visit. We had to spend a day there in order to deliver\r\ncertain letters, which were to procure us facilities for hunting further\r\nWest, and a most amusing day it proved to be. Our cicerone was a local\r\ngentleman who had been warned of our coming, and was kindness itself.\r\nOnly one thing he expected in return, and that was boundless, literally\r\nboundless, admiration of St. Louis and all that was in it. In our\r\nsecret hearts we were not much impressed; wealth, dinginess and dust\r\nstruck as the chief features of the city; but our friend found subject\r\nfor self-gratification even in the dust. “There, sir!” he seemed to say,\r\n“I’ll trouble you to show me such dust as this in any of your played-out\r\nold European cities.” He offered us refreshment in the shape of a bottle\r\nof “Imperial,” a light, sparkling wine rather like perry. “This, sir, is\r\nsome of our native prŏdūce. How do you find it compare with the vintages\r\nof Champagne? I am told that it is greatly admired at Paris, sir.” We\r\nvowed that no such wine had been tasted since the days of Noah.\r\n\r\nOur friend was gratified. In America the word good is insufficient;\r\nyou must say that everything is the best; less praise is an insult and\r\nan ignorant insult at that. One thing he admitted that St. Louis had\r\nnever been able to achieve. They could defeat Reims and Épernay, but a\r\nchampagne bottle they could not make; some element was wanting which\r\nwould enable their glass to stand the pressure. So a roaring trade was\r\ndone in secondhand bottles from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe drove through the city and into the suburbs, composed for the most\r\npart of neat little villas, some detached, some semi-detached, standing\r\nin tiny gardens. Standing before a clean little white house with green\r\nshutters, and adorned at the entrance with some plaster of Paris\r\nstatuary, our cicerone said: “These are the residences of our rich\r\ntownsmen. How do they compare with the mansions of your aristocracy in\r\nLondon?” I was foolish enough to say that they seemed to me a little\r\nsmall. He smiled a smile of pity at the insular jealousy of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt appears that there was living at St. Louis an English gentleman named\r\nShaw, who, having made a beautiful garden, offered it to the town on\r\ncondition that it should be kept up at the public expense. The City\r\nFathers objected to this condition. “Yes, sir, they are skinflints,” said\r\nour friend; “what we want here is about one hundred and fifty first-class\r\nfunerals, then we should get along fine.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening he dined with us and came to see us off at the station,\r\nwhere he presented each of us with a large octavo volume of three\r\nhundred and thirteen pages entitled, “St. Louis, the Future Great City\r\nof the World, by L. N. Reavis. Fourth edition.” The book is full of\r\nquotations of speeches by men of more or less, chiefly less, eminence in\r\nwhich the audiences of St. Louis had been flattered to the top of their\r\nbent. “Voices,” Mr. Reavis calls them, “prophetic voices.” I cannot\r\nresist copying a choice bit culled from Mr. Reavis’ own writing: “And if\r\nit be true, as I hope to establish, that St. Louis is destined to be the\r\ngreat city of the world, the all-directing head and central moving heart\r\nof the accumulated civilization of the great family of man, the facts of\r\nher history will in time be sought for, by citizens and writers, with\r\nan eagerness and a zeal never before called out by the interests of any\r\nother city—not even of Jerusalem nor of Rome. Henceforth St. Louis must\r\nbe viewed in the light of her future, her mightiness in the Empire of the\r\nworld, her sway in the rule of States and nations. Her destiny is fixed.\r\nLike a new-born Empire she is moving forward to conscious greatness, and\r\nwill soon be the world’s magnet of attraction. Here will be reared great\r\nhalls for art and learning; here will congregate the great men and women\r\nof future ages; here will be represented some Solon and Hamilton, giving\r\nlaws for the higher and better government of the people; here will be\r\nrepresented some future great teachers of religion, teaching the ideal\r\nand the spiritual development of the race, and the higher allegiance of\r\nman to the Angel-world; here will live some future Plutarch, who will\r\nweigh the great men of his age; here some future Mozart will thrill the\r\nstrings of a more perfect lyre; here some future Rembrandt, through his\r\nown ideal imagination, will picture for himself more perfect panoramic\r\nscenes of nature’s lovely landscapes,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWe thanked our kind friend. The engine shrieked and we rolled away from\r\nthe future great city of the world into outer darkness, illuminated at\r\nintervals by the blaze of burning forests.\r\n\r\nWe spent a day at Kansas City, not from choice, but because there\r\nwas no connecting train to take us on to Fort Wallace, which was our\r\ndestination. Kansas City, on the Missouri river, just below the mouth\r\nof the Kansas river, was at that time a thriving town risen five and\r\ntwenty years earlier out of a howling wilderness and already boasting a\r\npopulation of forty thousand and representing a capital of some twenty\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Reavis, the author I have just quoted, says: “Its splendid buildings,\r\nits many railways, its increasing wealth and sleepless enterprise,\r\nchallenge the admiration of the East as well as of the West.” A shot\r\nfired from a long bow indeed! After reading such a description it was\r\nstartling to see pigs picking up a luxurious living off the plentiful\r\ngarbage strewn in that magnificent street the Broadway. The pigs were\r\nvery real,—the splendid buildings, creations of Mr. Reavis’ fancy which\r\nmust have been stimulated by hashish, for the deepest draughts of the\r\nrather thin “Imperial” would hardly account for such flights as this.\r\n“In the development of the great West, with its fertility of soil and\r\nboundless natural resources, Kansas City is bound to play a prominent\r\npart. She will grow with the growing country, increasing every day in\r\nwealth and power; she will wear the golden crown and royal purple, and\r\nbe hailed Queen City of the Missouri Valley.” The prophecy was delivered\r\nforty years ago. I hope it may have come true, and that the descendants\r\nof the pigs of those days may now be suitably housed, grunting in\r\ncomfortable sties.\r\n\r\nThere was not much to do by way of killing time, so we wandered off at\r\nhaphazard towards the wood-crowned bluffs round the town; our steps, as\r\nluck would have it, led us to Westport, a tiny village which was the\r\noriginal trading camp from which Kansas City sprang. The sun was hot, the\r\nroad deep-rutted and dusty like the roads in the North of China round\r\nabout Peking. To our joy when we reached the village we saw “Lager Bier”\r\nposted up over a little bar-room, so we went in thirsty and rather bored.\r\n\r\nThe place was kept by the oldest inhabitant, a very aged German of whom\r\nnothing was to be seen save only a portentously thick red nose; the rest\r\nof him was hidden by a grey military great coat and cap, which seemed to\r\ngrow out of a great shock mass of grizzled hair and snuffy beard, that\r\nprobably no comb or brush had disturbed for years.\r\n\r\nBelow the nose was a voice coming from no visible opening, and the voice\r\nuttered a jumble of German and English, most perplexing. The room, dirty,\r\nshabby, squalid, was hung round with portraits of the old Emperor\r\nWilhelm, Fritz the Crown Prince, Bismarck—rude representations of German\r\ntriumphs, ending in the surrender of his sword by the Emperor Napoleon.\r\nAt the back was a door, opening for company’s sake into a shop next door,\r\nkept by another old German, a gunsmith by trade, as dirty and snuffy as\r\nhis mate. When the two old gaffers found that we could speak to them in\r\ntheir mother tongue, how pleased they were! Immediately their tongues\r\nbegan to go like mill-clacks, telling us of the old days when they came\r\nout as pioneers, and drove a roaring trade with the Indians. The old\r\ngunsmith assured us that he might have retired upon a comfortable fortune\r\nlong ago, but he had stuck to Westport like a limpet to its rock. He had\r\nbecome used to the rough outpost life, in which he had grown old, so he\r\nset up his son in trade, and rubbed on as before in the days when the\r\nyoung out-growth of Kansas City “noch nicht anzudenken war.”\r\n\r\nPresently the two old fellows grew more confidential and let out what was\r\nprobably their true reason for remaining here, belief in the existence\r\nof a hidden treasure somewhere hard by, a treasure all in gold buried by\r\nthe early traders, Mexicans and borderers, under terror of attack from\r\nthe Indians. Happy the man who should light upon that treasure! For him\r\nthere would be no more living by the sweat of his brow under the curse of\r\nthe first sin, but a restoration to a garden of Eden with trees bearing\r\nsausages for fruit, streams flowing with Lager Bier, the air laden with\r\nthe perfume of never-extinguished canaster.\r\n\r\nThere is to me something infinitely touching in the memory of these two\r\nold cronies, wrapped in one another, hugging their friendship, their dirt\r\nand their superstitious belief in the hidden gold. They had well passed\r\nthe allotted span of life when I saw them—they must have been long since\r\ngathered to their fathers. Which went first? How fared it with the other?\r\n\r\nKansas City was proud of its press. There were four daily papers\r\npublished in English and one in German. I cannot honestly say that,\r\nwhether regarded from the point of view of literature or as providers\r\nof news, they could claim any merit worthy of “The Queen City of the\r\nMissouri Valley.” Their columns were in the main stuffed with abuse\r\nof each other and a certain amount of padding of the giant gooseberry\r\norder. Their powers of vituperation were remarkable. The _Kansas City\r\nTimes_, speaking of a rival, says: “For a low down, contemptible and\r\ninsignificant journalism we award the palm to the _Kansas City Journal_.\r\nIts editor’s lack of decency is only equalled by his mental poverty.” The\r\n_Topeca Commonwealth_, speaking of a Mr. Griffin, says, “He is a dirty\r\nliar, a malicious libeller and a large-sized and highly-scented skunk—Mr.\r\nGriffin has not been heard from yet on this somewhat pointed argument.”\r\n\r\nBuffalo hunting—I suppose I ought to say Bison hunting, but I keep to the\r\nname made famous by Buffalo Bill and others—was one of the chief objects\r\nof our expedition. The Kansas and Pacific Railway hung out most tempting\r\npictures of sport in the Wild West—all their stations had buffalo heads\r\nas advertisements with prodigious pictures of railway trains charging\r\nherds of myriads—“verra awkward for the coo.” In the afternoon, Mr.\r\nWeston, an Englishman in the employ of the railway, came to see us.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the year for the trek northwards of the herds which had\r\nmigrated to the South before the winter. However, Mr. Weston sent a\r\ntelegram of inquiry down the line, and the happy answer came back from\r\nFort Wallace, “Buffalo been seen within forty miles of this place.” So to\r\nFort Wallace we determined to go.\r\n\r\nWe started at nightfall and ought to have reached Fort Wallace in about\r\ntwenty-four hours, but the line was obstructed by the breaking down of\r\na goods train, so we had to undergo some thirty-two hours of very real\r\ndiscomfort, in the company of rowdy gamblers, the curse of those days\r\nin the West, women of no doubtful character and squalling children. The\r\nspitting of the gamblers was a fine art. During the day-time there was\r\nno consolation of fine scenery, for we were travelling through that most\r\ndismal wilderness the blooming prairie—of the night the less said the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nTravelling through the desert was something which no one will ever see\r\nagain. The march of civilization has created a revolution in the whole\r\naspect of the West. Cities have sprung up, farm steadings have been\r\nbuilt, and the vast expanse which I have seen black with the wandering\r\nbuffalo is now covered with waving crops. The buffalo has been improved\r\noff the face of the earth, only bred here and there in artificial\r\nreserves as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nForty years ago, in that dismal waste, at distances of about forty miles,\r\nwere log huts occupied by one man, where the engine pulled up to drink;\r\nbetween them not a dwelling—not a tree—a few sage bushes—a sort of dwarf\r\ncactus—hardly a blade of grass—the abomination of desolation. How in\r\nthis wilderness, this boundless desert with a round horizon, animal life\r\ncontrived to sustain itself was a mystery. Vast herds, probably millions\r\nof buffaloes, travelled north from Mexico in summer and back again south\r\nin the autumn. There were antelopes and coyotes (a sort of wolf), skunks,\r\nsquirrels, here and there horses that had run wild; of birds—larks,\r\nvultures, blackbirds with glorious yellow breasts, prairie chickens, wild\r\nducks. Then there were the pretty little prairie dogs, the tiny owls and\r\nthe rattlesnakes—the three said to live together in amity in the same\r\nholes. The beasts and birds had company, the lonely railway man in the\r\nlog hut had but himself and his thoughts.\r\n\r\nGovernor Lowe, who was British Minister at Peking, told me a capital\r\nstory of how the famous Senator Wade, who was Senator for Ohio,\r\ntravelling West found at one of these solitary huts an Ohio man, who at\r\nonce recognized him, shook him by the hand and said, “Why, Mr. Senator, I\r\nam right pleased to see you!” The Senator thanked him for his welcome and\r\nanswered, “But what in the name of wonder are you doing here?” “Well, Mr.\r\nSenator, I’m going to tell you. This is going to be one of the greatest\r\ncities in the world.” The Senator failed to see the possibilities of that\r\none log hut in the wilderness. “Yes, sir! There is a river runs about\r\nseven miles from here, and we air calculating to divert the course of\r\nthat river and bring it along here. Then we shall get a few first-class\r\nfamilies from East and West to come and locate here and this will become\r\na great town, giving the go-by to New York, San Francisco, and may be\r\neven to London and Paris. All that is wanted here, sir, is a little water\r\nand good society.” “Yes,” answered the witty Senator, “and the same\r\nremark applies equally to Hell.” The “We” of the solitary eremite speaks\r\nvolumes. In it lies the keynote of American confidence and success.\r\n\r\nIt was freezing hard at 5.30 in the morning of the 25th when we left\r\nthat miserable train with its unholy crew of undesirables, having had\r\nto pass a second night on board instead of comfortably in Mr. Ruggles’\r\nexcellent inn at Fort Wallace. He was sitting up for us, for we had\r\nwarned him of our coming; he struggled out of that yawny state of coma\r\nwhich is engendered by a night of arm-chair and tobacco and showed us\r\nto our rooms. A few pails of ice-cold water washed away the memories of\r\nthose two wretched nights, and a delicious breakfast of milk, new laid\r\neggs and buffalo steaks made new men of us. Mr. and Mrs. Ruggles were\r\nreally delightful people. She, poor lady! was a very different person\r\nfrom the landlady whom one would imagine presiding over a prairie hotel.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange life for a highly educated lady, whose mind had been\r\nformed by travel and stored with memories of London, Paris, Venice,\r\nFlorence, Rome! That she should turn cateress for a rough crowd of\r\nengineers, navvies, teamsters and hunters! We were truly in a land of\r\nsurprises where your tavern-keeper may be a polished gentleman and the\r\nchief of the State an ignorant boor. After breakfast we held a council\r\nof war, Mr. Ruggles being the chief spokesman. After some debate we\r\nagreed by his advice to enter into negotiations with one Mr. Dodge, the\r\nboss of an “outfit” about thirty miles off, to which he was going to\r\nsend out a team with flour for his men—in that “outfit” there was the\r\nunique advantage of a small tent—in any other we should have to lie under\r\nthe stars; a glance at a frozen fountain which the sun’s rays had not\r\nyet been able to melt decided us. The tent was the great lure, and we\r\ndetermined to join Mr. Dodge’s outfit if he would have us. Mr. Ruggles\r\nsoon settled that for us, and at ten o’clock, having crammed a few\r\nnecessaries into a bag and put our rifles together, we started under the\r\nconvoy of Andy Phillips, teamster, hunter, and partner in some sort with\r\nMr. Dodge.\r\n\r\nBy this time a whole troop of idlers, hunters and navvies had crept out\r\nof sundry very dirty blankets and buffalo robes in which they had been\r\nhuddled in back rooms and outhouses, and we had to run the gauntlet of a\r\nvolley of chaff as we sallied forth. “What will you take for your skins?”\r\n“What’s your contract for heads?” They did not believe in us nor in our\r\nsmart-looking Rigby rifles. It is astonishing how suspicious men of a\r\ncertain class are of cleanliness; dirt alone is to them workmanlike. The\r\nlast thing I heard was: “Wal! Wal! Wal! Damn me if them fellers don’t\r\nthink they’re gwine to hunt bufflers! Wal! Wal! Wal!” The contemptuous\r\nway in which this was said was greeted with loud applause and laughter.\r\n\r\nOur way lay for a while eastward along the line of the railway, and then\r\nwe struck off north on to the open prairie.\r\n\r\nAndy Phillips, our teamster, was a character. A small, wiry man, dressed\r\nin a flannel shirt worn so long that it had become a second skin; an old\r\ncoat many sizes too big for him, tied together at the breast by a bit of\r\nstring, the sleeves being rolled up so as to give his hands a chance of\r\ncoming out; a rusty old billycock hat, much indented and of uncertain\r\nbrim. The fierce sun and wind and frost, weather and dirt, had tanned\r\nman and clothes to one uniform neutral tint; no human being could say\r\nwhat might once have been the colour of either. In conversation he did\r\nnot shine, but when directly challenged to give an opinion he had an\r\noracular way of delivering short, jerky sentences, prefaced by a turn of\r\nhis quid and a spit, which was very imposing. There was no temptation to\r\ntalk, though, for the cart was springless and the prairie not as smooth\r\nas a billiard table, so we were most mercilessly jolted and pitched about\r\nwhenever the mules broke into the semblance of a trot.\r\n\r\nVery amusing were the prairie dogs, quaint little beasts living in\r\ntownships of small mounds, arranged like ant-hills, with so much method\r\nand regularity that one might fancy that each little colony had its\r\nmayor, municipal officers, laws, ordinances and rules of etiquette. As we\r\ndrew near, the inhabitants—tiny yellow beasts something between squirrels\r\nand weasels—would turn out in strength, taking their stands each on the\r\ntop of his house, with tails most impertinently cocked, barking, yapping,\r\nscolding with absurd little voices to warn us off; but as soon as the\r\ncart came close to the village, there was universal panic and _sauve\r\nqui peut_; the braggarts with one consent would take headers into their\r\nholes; not a prairie dog to be seen until we reached the next township,\r\nwhere the same comedy of threats, rage and terror would be played anew.\r\n\r\nFor many miles we jolted along without seeing anything in the way of game\r\nto shoot at, but at last we came within a few hundred yards of a couple\r\nof antelope. Their backs were turned to us and they were feeding up wind,\r\nso Oliver got down and tried to stalk them, but there was not covert\r\nenough to hide a shrew-mouse, let alone a big Blue well over six feet;\r\none of them curled round and caught a sight of him as he was crawling up,\r\nand they galloped away into space.\r\n\r\nThe only chance of getting near to the pretty, shy creatures would be\r\nwhen the nature of the ground, where the prairie is cut up into divides\r\nby dry water-courses (canyons), would enable the hunter to creep up to\r\nthem unseen, or bring him upon them suddenly without his having had any\r\nprevious inkling of their whereabouts. Although the eye stretched to the\r\nbounds of a round horizon, the irregularities of the prairie sometimes\r\nhid objects close by, or on the next divide.\r\n\r\nIn this way, later in the day, Oliver got another chance at an antelope;\r\nit was a long and difficult shot, and though he made practice good enough\r\nto draw a note of admiration even from the undemonstrative Andy, he was\r\nunsuccessful. As for me, the only chance I had all day was at an old grey\r\nwolf-coyote, who was lumbering along at that awkward, shuffling pace\r\nwhich seems so slow and is so fast. He was more than two hundred yards\r\noff and both my bullets struck the ground so close to him that he gave a\r\ngreat terror-stricken jump each time;—unfortunately very near does not\r\ncount at any game. We stopped for our mid-day meal at a creek where we\r\nfound a pool of stagnant water from which we scared half a dozen mallard;\r\nwe had some bread and cold meat, and Mr. Dodge had thrown into the cart\r\na can or two of preserved strawberries and oysters—the former tasted of\r\ntin and sugar, the latter of tin and salt, but friend Andy enjoyed them\r\nmightily.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mules had fed and rested, Andy gave the signal for a\r\nmove. “Now then, you fellers! If you’re ready I’m a-gwine to move on,\r\nand I guess we’ll beat the sun an hour.” The further we advanced in the\r\nprairie, the more frequent became the carcases of dead buffaloes, some\r\nalready blanched skeletons, others more recently killed, torn and mangled\r\nby wolves and vultures. Even had economic and agricultural reasons\r\nnot determined their extermination, there would probably have been few\r\nbuffaloes left by now.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter was on a huge scale. Old bulls and young, even cows heavy\r\nin calf were slain mercilessly, often in places where the skins could not\r\nbe removed, so that the massacre was profitless and without excuse. The\r\nhunters seemed to be bent on killing the goose that laid the golden egg.\r\nA good bull’s skin was worth two dollars, a cow’s skin one dollar; to-day\r\nI am told that a bison’s head in good condition is worth a huge sum to\r\ndecorate the walls of some sporting club in the West.\r\n\r\nOur day was not quite blank, for Oliver shot a jackass rabbit, a sort of\r\nbig hare with huge, flapping ears; the expanding bullet made mince-meat\r\nof it, but we picked up the pieces and were thankful for them at\r\nsupper-time. Towards the end of the day Oliver’s keen eyes spied some\r\nhuge black lumps in the distance—buffalo! We were mad to go after them,\r\nbut Andy looked at the herd and then looked at the sun, which by this\r\ntime was low in the heavens, turned his quid in his mouth, and saying,\r\n“I guess a man feels pretty bad if he’s lost on this yar prairer after\r\ndark,” whipped up his mules and drove on. Next day, when I was being led\r\non for mile after mile by a herd, I knew how wise he had been. But at the\r\ntime I hated him and his prudence; I thought he lacked keenness. Andy not\r\nkeen! I soon had occasion to know better.\r\n\r\nThe day was fast waning when we reached the camp. How the same word\r\nmay mean different things! In the East the camp used to mean three or\r\nfour luxurious tents comfortably carpeted and furnished with iron beds\r\nand arm-chairs, pitched under the shade of trees by a running stream,\r\na bustling dragoman ready to conjure tea, coffee, cigars, anything and\r\neverything out of his saddlebags. Here a fire of dried buffalo dung near\r\na creek of muddy water full of little red worms; the air poisoned by the\r\nsmell of drying hides, out of which one, rather better seasoned than the\r\nothers, would serve as a bed. The boasted tent turned out to be nothing\r\nmore than a bit of torn canvas stretched on three poles, open to the four\r\nwinds of heaven. This was our “camp” in the West.\r\n\r\nBy and by “the boys” came in from hunting; a tatterdemalion crew, ragged,\r\nunkempt and very, very dirty; it would be difficult to imagine a rougher,\r\nwilder-looking lot. Throwing down their rifles on the iron-hard ground\r\nas if they rather wished to break them, they set to work to prepare\r\nsupper, taking little or no notice of us. There was Captain Vogel, the\r\nboss of the outfit, Prairie Bill, his partner, Mexico Bill and two minor\r\nsatellites who spoke not, and apparently had no names worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nThe dung fire was quickly made up again; one man set to work to make\r\ndamper in a skillet; another cut some lumps of buffalo flesh off a\r\nhuge carcase and threw them into a frying-pan; a third boiled some\r\nroughly-ground coffee in the foul water of the creek—this, with the\r\nfragments of Oliver’s jackass-rabbit, constituted our feast. No whisky\r\nor other spirits, for the hunters only drank when they went into a\r\nsettlement to spend and gamble away their hard-earned money. Then, to use\r\ntheir own expression, they would “make the place howl.”\r\n\r\nAs the pannikin of coffee went round, our hosts became more communicative\r\nand began telling us hunting stories garnished with all that wealth of\r\nimprecation for which the language of the Wild West is justly famous.\r\nOne story of Prairie Bill’s I jotted down in my pocket-book that night.\r\nPrairie Bill was a tall, active fellow, as lean as a lath, all wire and\r\nmuscle, with keen, beadlike, black eyes and an impudent little snub\r\nnose—a regular dare-devil. Looking at him I felt half tempted to believe\r\nthat his story might be true. By way of preface he swore steadily for\r\nseveral seconds, and having thus relieved his mind, he spat furiously,\r\nand was then in trim to proceed.\r\n\r\n“If you fellers want to hear how I once killed a bloomin’ buffler,\r\nblarm me to most etarnal smash if I don’t tell yer.” (oath). “I’d been\r\na-follerin’ a herd all the ruddy day without gettin’ near enough for a\r\nshot, when all on a sudden a big bull drops astarn and looks me in the\r\nface. Wal! I fired and hit him, and darn me if I didn’t plug him seven\r\ntimes out of my Spencer rifle without killin’ him.” (Many oaths.) “When\r\nthe big brute see as I hadn’t got a shot left, darned if he didn’t put\r\nhis ruddy head down and come bang at me.” (More oaths.) “Guess I felt\r\nconsiderable mean, you bet! But there warn’t no time for thinkin’, and\r\nas he comes a tearin’ up, ready to give me Hell, I steps on one side,\r\nand ketchin’ hold of his mane, swings myself on to the back of him.”\r\n(Oaths of attestation.) “Wal! there I was, darn me, a-ridin’ on the ruddy\r\nbuffler across the ruddy prairer. What did I do then? Why I pulled out my\r\nold knife and kep’ a-stickin’ of him in his ruddy neck till he dropped\r\ndown as dead as General Washin’ton. And next day darned if me and the\r\nCaptain here didn’t skin him.”\r\n\r\nPrairie Bill ended as he had begun, with a long volley of oaths. His\r\nmates joined in, swearing in sympathetic chorus—all except Captain Vogel,\r\nwhom I never heard utter an oath.\r\n\r\nThe night became cruelly cold; if we sat to the leeward of the fire the\r\nsmoke and dung ashes were blown into our noses and eyes; if we faced it\r\nour backs were frozen; our legs were cramped sitting tailor fashion, and\r\naltogether we were so uncomfortable that we soon were glad to turn in.\r\nWe lay down dressed as we were on hides stretched over the hard, frozen\r\nground, with our rifle-cases for pillows. The camp dogs barked, and the\r\nmen grunted, muttered and snored. Sleep was fitful; we were all rather\r\ncrusty and dismally uncomfortable, for we were huddled together under\r\nthat imposture of a tent, packed as tight as a box of figs.\r\n\r\nThere was no temptation to play the sluggard and I rose as soon as the\r\nfirst streaks of daylight tinged the blackness of the east. On my way to\r\nthe camp fire I met Andy Phillips, trembling with excitement. He had been\r\nalong the creek to look after his mules, which had been so badly tied up\r\nthe night before by Mexico Bill that they had strayed. He had not found\r\nthem, but he had seen a herd of buffalo. When he saw me he hurried up\r\nand hissed out laconically, “Bufflers t’crik!” “Do you think we can get\r\nat them?” “Guess we kin.” I ran back for my rifle and off we started. As\r\nwe went along Andy told me that in the herd which he had seen there were\r\nseveral very fine old bulls; they had come down to the creek to drink at\r\na point about a mile and a half off, and he did not think they would move\r\nfar away. So we got down into the winding creek, which in most places was\r\nquite dry, the banks being high enough to hide us; so Andy felt confident\r\nthat I should get a shot. I was by no means sure of myself, though, for\r\nI was nervous and in a fever of excitement, madly eager to get a head,\r\nand my hands were numbed and stiff from the blistering cold iron of the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the spot indicated by Andy I could almost hear the\r\nbeating of my own heart. Very cautiously we crawled up the bank and\r\npeered over. Not a sign of a buffalo to be seen! I was greatly vexed, not\r\nthinking for the moment of the inequality of the levels of the divides,\r\nand forgetting that the whole herd, not having been disturbed, could\r\nhardly be more than half a mile off at most. “The critturs is bound to\r\nbe close by, anyways,” whispered Andy as he marched off again up the\r\ncreek. He knew the sort of ground and stopped at a place where the bank\r\ncommanded a view of the next divide, and sure enough there the herd was,\r\nthirty or forty great awkward, shaggy, black monsters, quietly feeding\r\nabout five hundred yards off. Luckily the creek here took a sharp turn\r\nwhich enabled us to get within closer range, the wind not betraying us,\r\nand when next we put our noses over the bank the nearest beasts were not\r\nmuch more than a hundred and fifty yards from us.\r\n\r\nAs we were watching them the biggest bull, a fine old fellow with a huge\r\nblack mane and a long goat’s beard, detached himself from a bunch of\r\ncows and stood stretching himself and cocking his tail. There he stood,\r\nbroadside on to me, a glorious chance. “Take the old chap as is a-cockin’\r\nhis tail,” Andy whispered in my ear, but there was no need of the hint;\r\nbefore the words were well out of his mouth the rifle had spoken and the\r\ndull thud that followed told that the bullet had struck home. “He has it,\r\nby the Lord!” shouted Andy. No apathy about him now! The old bull bowed\r\nto the shot, took a pace or two to the front, then turned to the right,\r\ntottered for a couple of seconds, sank down, and rolled over stone dead,\r\nshot through the heart. The rest of the herd, when they saw their chief\r\nstricken, gathered round him for a few moments, as is their wont at the\r\nsight of blood, and when the prairie rang with the noise of his fall, an\r\nalmost metallic sound, trotted slowly off, Andy sending a parting shot\r\nafter them in vain.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was too much excited over my first buffalo to think of\r\nfiring a second shot. I ran up to get a close look at him. We measured\r\nthe distance; one hundred and seventy yards. Andy, highly delighted at my\r\nsuccess, made short work of cutting off the head, which now hangs in my\r\nhall at Batsford. We were now pretty hungry and went back to breakfast in\r\ngreat glee. How good the muddy coffee and the tough buffalo steak tasted!\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the camp we found that the others had naturally\r\nbreakfasted and started. Oliver with Prairie Bill as his aide-de-camp,\r\nTom Nickalls under the guidance of young Mexico. It was just as well for\r\nthe latter that he was out of the way when Andy turned up, or there would\r\nhave been an explosion in the matter of those strayed mules. Captain\r\nVogel had stayed behind for me.\r\n\r\nMy second campaign under Captain Vogel was very different from the first.\r\nWe had to face our quarry on the open prairie, stalking was out of the\r\nquestion, trickery and deceit the only means of getting near the poor,\r\nstupid brutes. We had to play at being buffaloes. It was not a difficult\r\ngame. The two men sticking so close together as to show no daylight\r\nbetween them, and hunching their backs, had to lead a horse equally close\r\nbehind them. The innocent simplicity of the bison was quite taken in\r\nby the stratagem, and even in the springtime, when the beasts were the\r\nmost suspicious, the hunter had no difficulty in getting to within two\r\nhundred yards of his prey, provided the wind were right. Should the herd\r\nbe puzzled, they would not move off except for a little way—slowly and\r\nstopping from time to time. When they stopped the men must stop too. By\r\ndegrees the beasts would become more familiar, and so it was generally\r\neasy to get a shot at from one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards. In\r\nthe late summer and autumn they would allow themselves to be approached\r\nquite near, so that the hunters could shoot them as easily as cows in a\r\nbyre.\r\n\r\nCaptain Vogel was a small, lean man, not strongly built but toughened\r\nby hard work and a strenuous life. Long elf-locks of fair, sun-bleached\r\nhair fell over his shoulders; his beard was thick and tangled. He had\r\nbright blue eyes which always seemed to be looking into the distance—a\r\nhunter’s eyes. His features were regular and showed breeding. He was clad\r\nin a nondescript suit of grey rags and a battered old wideawake; his\r\narms were a heavy three-barrelled rifle, the only one of its kind that\r\nI ever saw—and a hunting-knife. A strange man, as gentle as a woman, a\r\nparagon alone among the hunters of the West, for he neither swore, nor\r\nsmoked, nor chewed, nor drank spirits, nor gambled; not even when resting\r\nduring a holiday in some town. As his name implied, he was of German\r\norigin, but he had no knowledge of his birth tongue, though he remembered\r\nhearing his father and mother speak it when he was a child. Born in the\r\nEastern States he came West many years ago, a sickly youth, condemned by\r\nthe doctors, and took to hunting in search of health. He found it in the\r\nkeen air of the prairie. Now sickness and pain were strangers to him, and\r\nfatigue had lost its power over him. His little three-year-old mare, his\r\nsolitary pet, followed him about like a dog. His one ambition was to set\r\nup as a farmer somewhere in the Wild Country when he should have saved\r\nmoney enough.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 times were not so good for the hunters as they had been. A year\r\nago a bull’s skin was worth three dollars and a cow’s two; now prices\r\nhad gone down. A bull’s skin only fetched two dollars and a cow’s one.\r\nHe calculated his expenses at a dollar and a half a day, and he and his\r\npartner, Prairie Bill, could each reckon on six dollars a day profit. He\r\nwould soon have made his little pile, for he banked all his money instead\r\nof gambling. Were his parents alive? Had he any friends left? He did\r\nnot know; it was long years since he had had a letter. He could give no\r\naddress; here to-day and there to-morrow, a wanderer on the face of the\r\nearth. Last year he fell in with a man from his old neighbourhood, but\r\nthe man was too drunk to understand or to tell him anything, and the next\r\nmorning he had gone away nobody knew whither, vanished into space. With\r\nsuch talk we went our way into the prairie to play at being buffaloes.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone very far when we spied a large herd in the distance;\r\nthey were moving towards us, evidently having been disturbed, for every\r\nnow and then they would turn to look behind them. It is the unwritten\r\nlaw of the prairie that no man shall interfere with a herd that is being\r\nfollowed by another hunter, so we stood still and watched. In a few\r\nminutes we saw Oliver and Prairie Bill come over the horizon and on to\r\nthe same divide with the buffaloes; then there was a general stampede and\r\nOliver, leaping on to his horse, gave chase.\r\n\r\nCaptain Vogel was much excited and annoyed, for in his judgment his\r\npartner had bungled the hunt badly. All of a sudden the hindmost beasts\r\nof the flying herd stopped, and Oliver, jumping off as quick as thought,\r\ndropped a cow just as she was galloping off again. It was a pretty sight,\r\nmade all the more so by the mirage which threw a mist over the distance.\r\nIt was like a vision seen in a dream; a ghostly hunter pursuing phantom\r\nbuffaloes over a desert shrouded in the dim mystery of an opalescent haze.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Oliver’s cow the herd broke into two divisions, the\r\none trekking off to the south, with Oliver and Prairie Bill after them,\r\nthe other moving northwards; it would have been no breach of etiquette\r\nhad we followed these, but they were a long way off—a mile or more—and\r\nCaptain Vogel preferred going forward in the hope of finding a herd that\r\nhad not been “skeered.” For some three or four miles we travelled wearily\r\non under a blazing sun, our feet sinking in the dry, hot dust, without\r\nseeing anything. At last a change in the level brought us in sight of\r\nfive huge old bulls lying down about four or five hundred yards away,\r\nand close to them, on the left, three antelopes peacefully feeding. Here\r\nwas a rare piece of luck! I would rather have one antelope than all five\r\nbulls, so we crept slowly on towards the left, but we did not dare try to\r\nget very near lest they should take fright and gallop off. We halted at\r\nbetween two and three hundred yards from them and lay down, waiting for\r\none to turn his side to me.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed an age of suspense, the psychological moment came. I\r\ndrew a long breath, took a very deliberate aim, and pulled the trigger.\r\nTo my bitter disappointment the bullet just grazed the antelope high in\r\nthe shoulder. Two inches lower and I should have had my trophy. In an\r\ninstant the three pretty creatures were skimming like swallows over the\r\nhorizon. I was glad to think that my intended victim was only scratched.\r\n\r\nStartled by the crack of the rifle the five buffaloes struggled up\r\nin their ungainly fashion and looked uneasily about them, but seeing\r\nnothing that they considered dangerous—for the clever little mare knew\r\nher business too well to budge an inch, and we were acting our strange\r\npart most convincingly—they only shuffled lazily a few paces off, we in\r\npursuit, slackening our pace when they turned, hurrying when they went\r\nforward. In this way we soon came within easy shot, and I dropped the\r\nbiggest of the five, the great clumsy creature rolling over and over and\r\nraising a cloud of dust. We both thought that he would get up again, but\r\nhaving watched him for a minute or two and seeing his legs stiffen, we\r\naccounted him dead and went on after his mates, who had pursued their\r\nslow course, in no wise affected by his fate. Just as I was preparing for\r\na second shot we heard a terrific noise and there was the big bull whom\r\nwe had left for dead coming on at full gallop in the best of health, with\r\nhis head down, snorting and blowing up the dust, which looked like smoke\r\ncoming in two volumes out of his nostrils.\r\n\r\nWe knelt down and prepared to receive cavalry, thinking that he was going\r\nto charge us; but his only thought was to rejoin his faithless friends,\r\nand the five monsters, now thoroughly frightened, fled into the mirage\r\nand we saw them no more. The mirage was very baffling; it was one of the\r\ndifficulties of the hunter. In the first place, for some unexplained\r\nreason, it made all the beasts very wild, and in the second it made a\r\nfield glass useless. This, however, did not affect the native hunters;\r\nlike the Indian shikari they preferred to trust to their own eyes and\r\nwere afraid to use a glass lest they should weaken their eagle sight.\r\n\r\nOn the furthest divide that we reached we found an enormous herd; the\r\nprairie was black with them. Captain Vogel reckoned that there must have\r\nbeen over two thousand heads. Playing the same game I shot three fine\r\nbulls without difficulty or adventure. Two others, for which we could not\r\nstop, would be gathered next day. Vogel shot very badly, not killing a\r\nsingle beast, but he said himself that he did not pride himself so much\r\non shooting as on getting up to game; of that craft he certainly was a\r\nmaster. I could not help thinking that his wonderful old three-barrelled\r\nshooting-iron had something to do with the missing. One old bull led us\r\na fine dance, making us follow mile after mile without ever giving us a\r\nbroadside chance. Further and further on we followed him until at last\r\nwe had to give him up as a bad job, for we were between ten and twelve\r\nmiles from camp and we had twisted and turned in so many windings that\r\nVogel declared that he did not know where we were. A terror! We were\r\nparched with thirst and my feet were sore from walking in the hot dust.\r\nThere were, of course, no landmarks, so we had to guess at our homeward\r\nroute with the help of the sun and my pocket compass.\r\n\r\nA long, anxious tramp brought us to a divide where Vogel recognized some\r\ncarcases which he had skinned the week before; close by he knew of a\r\npuddle of water at which he and the mare drank luxuriously; I could not!\r\nIt was full of live insects and green vegetable matter, so I preferred to\r\ncarry the leather which had once been my tongue into camp rather than run\r\nthe risk of that poisonous draught. Four or five miles more brought us\r\ninto camp where Tom Nickalls was blazing away with his rifle at a prairie\r\nchicken which was fool enough to stop until a lucky shot cut its head\r\noff. Oh! the joy of a drink of almost clean water out of Tom’s flask!\r\n\r\nCaptain Vogel and I were the last to come into camp. On comparing notes\r\nwe found that our bag consisted in all of nine buffalo—not counting the\r\ntwo of mine that Vogel would be sure to find and skin the next day.\r\nOliver had killed four, Tom Nickalls one, I four. Not a bad piece of\r\nwork, as even the hunters were obliged to confess, and they are not given\r\nto paying compliments. Our guns were greatly praised. Prairie Bill, with\r\npicturesque and highly ornate additions, declared that they had only one\r\nfault, and that was that they did not belong to him.\r\n\r\nAndy, mourning over his mules, not yet found, stopped in the midst of\r\na torrent of abuse addressed to young Mexico, to swear that “them guns\r\nshoots wicked.” “You may bet your pile on that,” said Captain Vogel. The\r\nmen said, however, that our rifles were too light for their use in the\r\nautumn time, when the big slaughter takes place. At that time they needed\r\nweapons with plenty of weight of metal so that they should not heat\r\nreadily. That great sportsman and rifleman, Lord Elcho (the late Lord\r\nWemyss), once laughed at my Rigby as being too heavy. I wonder what he\r\nwould have said to Captain Vogel’s three-barrelled cannon.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this buffalo hunting was tame sport; one day of it, just for\r\nthe novelty of the thing, was all very well, but neither of us would\r\nhave cared for a renewal of the experience. The vast dreariness of the\r\nprairie offered no charm of scenery, none of the poetry of deer-stalking\r\ncelebrated by Scrope. The American bison, fierce as he looked, was not\r\na savage, revengeful enemy like the Indian buffalo; even when wounded\r\nhe rarely turned upon his man. Hunting the creatures on horseback, and\r\npistolling the master bull, which was the sport of the United States\r\nofficers garrisoning the outlying forts, must have been fine fun. But for\r\nthat we had not the necessary mounts. Had I had another day I should have\r\nconfined myself to going after antelope; that, at least, was an exciting\r\nsport, needing great wariness and patience.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life I on this day saw a herd of wild\r\nhorses—perhaps I ought to say “horses run wild,” for we are told that\r\nthere is no such thing as an indigenous American horse, so these\r\nmust have been runaways, even though their savage state might have\r\nbeen decades or even centuries old. They followed us cautiously at a\r\nrespectful distance, attracted, probably, by the charms of the good\r\nlittle mare. Mean-looking animals they were, in the poorest of condition;\r\ntheir manes and tails floating wildly in the wind; one, at least, must\r\nhave been a recent recruit escaped from some ranche, as the saddle galls\r\non his back proved. Horses that have once been broken in and have gone\r\nback to savagery and liberty are, so the hunters told me, the shiest of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAnother sight new to me was that of the “sun-dogs”; luminous clouds with\r\nprismatic colours hanging round the sun like beautiful satellites, a sure\r\nsign of coming storms and foul weather.\r\n\r\nRound the camp fire that night the battles of the day were fought over\r\nagain, but the main talk was about Indians. For the last week or two all\r\nAmerica had been ringing with the murder of General Canby and the Peace\r\nCommissioners by the Modoc Indians of the lava beds on the borders of\r\nCalifornia and Oregon; but the news, already stale even in Europe, had\r\nnot yet reached the prairie, and we were the first to tell the story to\r\nthe hunters. They were fiercely indignant, but far more so against the\r\nGovernment than against the Modocs. Even the wildest men, the men like\r\nPrairie Bill who held that “an Indian was never in his proper place till\r\nhe was six feet underground,” were bound to admit that the Government\r\ntreated them shamefully. The policy adopted at that time was, as the\r\nmarch of civilization advanced, to keep driving them back further and\r\nfurther on to reservations, as the parcels of land allotted to them\r\nwere called. In return for the rich territory of which they were robbed\r\nthe Government supplied them with blankets, arms, ammunition and other\r\nnecessaries, which were distributed by the “Indian Agents.”\r\n\r\nThere were few warmer berths in the gift of the ministry than that of an\r\nIndian Agent. There were practically no limits to his powers of robbery,\r\nand right good or bad use he made of his opportunities, charging for\r\nfirst-class double blankets and supplying the poor Indian starvelings\r\nwith half blankets of the thinnest and meanest description; and so it\r\nwas with all other stores. In a few years the agent was a rich man. The\r\nIndians knew they were being swindled, but there was no redress, and one\r\nfine day there would come a day of reckoning such as we were discussing.\r\nThen the soldiers must be called out to wreak vengeance which is not\r\nconsummated until many valuable lives have been lost; for what chance\r\nhave drill and discipline and regular troops against the cunning of\r\nsavages fighting on the vantage ground of such a stronghold as the lava\r\nbeds. “Why don’t they call out the hunters?” said Prairie Bill; “guess\r\nwe’re used to trackin’ varmin!”\r\n\r\nWherever there were gathered together ten men who live by honest labour,\r\nwhether they were merchants in New York, miners in California, farmers\r\nor hunters on the prairie, one heard the same abuse of the Government,\r\nthe same tale of bribery, extortion and corruption. These men, with whom\r\nwe were talking, were rough and wild and uncouth, but they were not bad\r\nfellows, as Mr. Ruggles testified, and they earned their bread hardly and\r\nhonestly by the sweat of their brows. Nay more! They had a fair right to\r\ncomplain, for they were the most likely men to suffer by the policy of\r\na Government which provoked the savages by robbery, and then furnished\r\nthem with arms to avenge their outrages. It was the scalp of the hunter\r\nand not that of the Minister at Washington that was in peril. The Indian\r\nagent was surely one of the most striking products of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful “sun-dogs” were true prophets; the wind got up in the night\r\nand beat fiercely upon us as we lay under our tattered awning; towards\r\nthe dawn the rain came down and soaked us through and through. Tired\r\nas we were after our long tramp through the dust of the desert sleep\r\nwas impossible. The break of day was a relief. No news of Andy’s mules.\r\nHe had been after them all the day before, but found no trace of them;\r\nperhaps he had not sworn quite sufficiently at young Mexico. We were\r\nobliged to start and there was nothing for it but to borrow Vogel and\r\nPrairie Bill’s horses, Andy hoping that as his beasts were in the habit\r\nof travelling backwards with skins and forwards with stores, they might\r\nhave made tracks home to their stables. By this time we had become quite\r\nfriendly with our hunters and they bade us a touching farewell. I often\r\nthought of them afterwards. Did Vogel ever succeed in stocking a farm?\r\nWhat became of that reckless but very attractive scamp, Prairie Bill? And\r\nyoung Mexico, what was his fate?\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Fort Wallace with two heads and having accounted for\r\neight other beasts, for Tom Nickalls shot one on the way home, the\r\nhunters and loafers who had chaffed us so unmercifully on our departure\r\nchanged their tune. No praise was too high for us, we became heroes, and\r\nour once despised rifles were passed round, handled and admired by every\r\nidler about the place.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ruggles were delighted at our success. They too had had a\r\nlittle excitement during our absence, for a thief had broken into the\r\nhouse and stolen all Mrs. Ruggles’ jewellery and trinkets, keepsakes\r\nwhich are more valuable than ever in this dreary banishment. The man had\r\ngot in through the window of Oliver’s room and happily not noticing some\r\nof our boxes, in which there were a few articles of more or less value,\r\nmade straight for the poor lady’s apartment. In these parts a man had to\r\ntake the law into his own hands. Ruggles soon found out who was missing\r\nfrom the settlement, and starting by the next train caught the rogue at\r\na station down the line. Revolver in hand Ruggles offered him his choice\r\nbetween disgorging and having his brains blown out. He chose the former,\r\nso all was recovered save a dollar or two, which had been spent in drink.\r\nThe thief was a man well connected, who had gone down in the world,\r\nwrecked by drink and debauchery, and was now a navvy on the railroad.\r\nTowards eight o’clock in the evening the train carried us westward.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards learned from United States officers that our expedition\r\nhad been a little imprudent. The Sioux Indians, though not absolutely on\r\nthe war-path, were in an uncomfortable state of ferment. The news of the\r\nModoc massacre had spread among the tribes in the same mysterious manner\r\nthat tidings spread through the bazaars of India, and there was a general\r\nfeeling of uneasiness. At no time would it be pleasant, as we knew from\r\nour hunter friends, to meet Indians on the plain; at any rate they would\r\ntry to steal, a game at which they were very successful, especially when\r\nthe booty consisted of horses or cattle belonging to white men. All’s\r\nwell that ends well. We saw no Sioux, our scalps were tight upon our\r\nheads, and there is a certain tinge of pleasure in the idea of having\r\nincurred an even remotely possible danger!\r\n\r\nApril 28th.—Could there be a more delightful change after the dreary\r\nmonotony of the desert than to lift one’s eyes on waking to the radiant\r\nsnows of the Rocky Mountains?\r\n\r\nWe were hardly prepared to find Denver City so pleasant a place, and,\r\nabove all, so quiet and orderly; for in the Eastern States we had been\r\nled to believe that we should find one of those wild, lawless settlements\r\nof the West—models from which Bret Harte painted “The Luck of Roaring\r\nCamp” and other masterpieces, in which the six-shooter makes such a show.\r\nIndeed, in a New York paper I read an advertisement which ran as follows:\r\n“An hotel with bullet-proof walls has recently been erected at Denver\r\nCity, so that a gentleman can sit and listen to the shooting going on in\r\nthe next room without being incommoded by any feeling of danger.”\r\n\r\nThe East was in those days very hard upon the West, and, as I thought,\r\nvery unjustly; for there were vigilance committees everywhere, and Judge\r\nLynch—an obvious necessity in wild young communities—made short work of\r\nsweeping out ruffians who misbehaved themselves. Indeed, the West might\r\nboast that whereas the Tombs, the famous prison at New York, was full of\r\nmurderers, who might or might not be punished as politics might dictate,\r\nin Denver or Virginia City justice marched with no lame or uncertain\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nWe found a capital hotel, kept by one Charpiot, a Frenchman; gifted\r\nwith the genius of his race for cooking and serving things nicely, he\r\nwas known to fame as the Delmonico of the West; we had not been fed so\r\nwell since we left New York. What a pretty little town it was! Now I\r\nsuppose it has grown out of all recollection, but at the time of which I\r\nam writing (1873) it had but twelve thousand inhabitants. However much\r\nit may have spread it must still have its glorious view of the Rockies,\r\nwith the famous Pike’s Peak as the chief feature. The air was so pure and\r\nclear that though the great chain was fifteen miles off the mountains\r\nseemed quite close, as though a man might walk there under the hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough the town only began to be built in 1853 it was already a\r\nbustling, thriving little place. I wrote in my journal: “Being the centre\r\nof a rich agricultural and mineral district it does a brisk trade, and as\r\nthe prosperity of Colorado is developing itself with giant strides Denver\r\nCity is likely to continue its rapid growth.” I fancy that I might have\r\nworded my prophecy more strongly.\r\n\r\nWe found the town in a fever of excitement. President Grant with his wife\r\nand daughter had arrived and there was to be a grand reception in the\r\nevening at the house of Governor McCook, where the President was staying.\r\nBut the great attraction was the advent of a number of Indians who had\r\ncome in from their “reservation” to see the great Father. Their chief,\r\nold George Washington, as he called himself, was a small, thick-set old\r\nman, with a most villainous expression, heightened by dabs of blue, red,\r\nand yellow paint, which gave quite a fiendish look to his cruel mouth\r\nand cunning little bear’s eyes. Long, straight elf-locks of coarse black\r\nhair parted in the middle, and the parting painted vermilion, fell over\r\nhis shoulders. He wore a chimney-pot hat, decorated with red and yellow\r\nstreamers, a short blue coat with military buttons; necklaces and other\r\nornaments of coloured beads; two revolvers; leather trousers with tassels\r\nall down the sides; such was the noble savage of Fenimore Cooper, the\r\nmodern representative of Uncas and Chingachgook, as I saw him.\r\n\r\nHis crew were as ugly and evil-looking as their chief. Some carried bows\r\nand arrows in leathern quivers slung at their backs; not one was without\r\na revolver. Looking at their stunted, shapeless bodies, it was hard to\r\nsay whether they were men or women—“bucks or squaws” as an American\r\nwould put it. When we came upon them in one of the chief streets they\r\nwere bartering furs. The man in the shop said they were quite harmless.\r\n“Harmless, yes,” said a bystander; “so’s snakes when their teeth is\r\ndrawn. But I kinder guess it’s the sort of harmless you don’t want to be\r\ntoo near when you ain’t got a six-shooter about you.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril 29th.—When we left Denver City President Grant, with Mrs. Grant\r\nand the Princess Royal, as the American wags called her, was in the\r\ntrain, and for glory’s sake a crowd had assembled at Cheyenne to salute\r\nthe great man, soldiers and an ear-racking band being on the platform.\r\nThe President was no doubt a man who had rendered signal service to his\r\ncountry, but he was not of the quality which would find favour with the\r\nculture of Boston or the refinement of New York. The more delicately\r\nstrung of his countrymen looked upon him as common and boorish. The\r\nsecond Duke of Wellington used to tell a good story of him. The Duke\r\nalways felt it due to the name of his illustrious father, when any famous\r\nwarrior came to England, to offer him an entertainment at Apsley House.\r\nWhen General Grant came to England he was accordingly invited there to\r\ndinner. When he arrived and saw the portrait of the great Duke, he could\r\nfind nothing more appropriate to say than: “Ah! I have commanded more\r\nDivisions than that man ever commanded Regiments, and yet what a lot of\r\ntalk there has been about him.” “Yes,” answered the Duke in his droll,\r\ndry way, “I believe he was considered a meritorious person in his day.”\r\n\r\nThe second Duke was really a very witty man, and the fun of his\r\nconversation was enhanced by his rather grotesque appearance, and his\r\nhumorous manner. Alfred Montgomery used to imitate him, as he well knew,\r\nbut they loved one another dearly, and the Duke cared not one whit. One\r\nday at luncheon at Lady Dorothy Neville’s Mr. Edmund Yates was present.\r\nAlfred being mentioned, naturally the guests began telling stories of his\r\nwit. Yates turned round to the Duke and said: “You know, Mr. Montgomery\r\nis very fond of mimicking your Grace.” The Duke answered: “Yes! I know\r\nit, but let me give you a bit of advice, Mr. Yates. Don’t _you_ try to\r\nmimic a gentleman!” The Duke was a most admirable note writer. He told\r\nme how once Lady Dorothy Neville wrote to him saying that she was about\r\nrestoring the dear little church at Danksfee, and was asking her friends\r\nto help; so, feeling sure that he would wish to do something for the\r\nchurch in which he had so often worshipped, she had put down his name for\r\none hundred pounds. The answer was characteristic. He, too, was restoring\r\nthe church at Strathfieldsaye, and knowing that Lady Dorothy would wish\r\nto contribute in memory of old days he had put down her name for one\r\nhundred pounds. “In the circumstances no money need pass between us.”\r\n\r\nBut I am wandering and must hasten back to Cheyenne. We had some trouble\r\nwith our luggage, but when that was disposed of and we had had luncheon\r\nwe started for Ogden and Salt Lake City. It took us thirty-five hours to\r\nreach Ogden.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the journey was dull enough, spinning through the\r\neverlasting monotony of prairie, with glimpses of antelopes and wrathful\r\nprairie dogs. We turned into bed rather early and next day found\r\nourselves in the midst of the lovely wild scenery of the Rocky Mountains,\r\ngreat crags towering over the line with terrifying threats, as if the\r\nshaking of the train must bring them down upon us. In places great falls\r\nof snow had been tunnelled through, and the gorges were spanned by crazy\r\nwooden bridges that rocked under the long chain of cars. The line was\r\nhigh up among the snows, laid at giddy heights some eight thousand feet\r\nabove sea-level.\r\n\r\nIt was an Indian country, so there was a good deal of what Prairie Bill\r\nwould have called “poison” about. The curious-looking creatures, wrapped\r\nin their shoddy blankets, hung about the railway stations, impassive,\r\nunnoticing, impenetrable, as little moved as if they had been corpses by\r\nall that was going on around them. Had they any feelings? Perhaps, but\r\nthey never showed them. At Ogden we changed into the Salt Lake train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE MORMONS AND BRIGHAM YOUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nI had long wished to see the capital of the Mormons. Their story was so\r\nutterly unlike the nineteenth century, that in spite of much that was\r\nvulgar and contemptible it seemed to have a flavour of medieval romance.\r\nThe visions of Joe Smith, the farmer’s boy; the golden plates containing\r\nthe book of Mormon, revealed by an angel in 1823, and deciphered with the\r\nhelp of the Urim and Thummim; the persecutions and tortures endured by\r\nthe Saints with the heroism of martyrs; their flights, hounded from place\r\nto place; the murder of the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum Smith, after\r\nan audacious bid for the Presidentship of the United States; the Nauvoo\r\nMassacre; the crossing of the Mississippi to Council Bluffs; Brigham\r\nYoung succeeding to the mantle of the Prophet, and, like a second Moses,\r\nleading the Saints over the trackless desert and the terrors of the Rocky\r\nMountains, until on the 24th of July, 1847, decimated by all the horrors\r\nof extreme heat and cold, fatigue, hunger, thirst and disease, they\r\nreached their Pisgah! That much of all this, and more yet to come, should\r\nhave taken place within the memory of living men was indeed strange. And\r\nwhen the Mormons looked down upon the plain below the Wahsatch Mountains,\r\nand saw the great Salt Lake gleaming like a jewel in the sun, there arose\r\nfrom them a great cry recalling the “Thalatta! Thalatta!” of Xenophon’s\r\nten thousand, and with one voice they shouted: “The Land of Promise! The\r\nLand of Promise, held in reserve by the hand of God for the resting-place\r\nof His Saints!”\r\n\r\nThe city sprang into existence as if by magic. Brigham Young was\r\nall-powerful, bearing a more undisputed mastery than king or tsar or\r\nkaiser. He was a law unto himself, and had his _Vehmgericht_, or rather\r\nwas also a secret court unto himself. True, there was no _Folterkammer_,\r\nno _eiserne Jungfrau_, but those old methods were out of date; the\r\nrevolver and the bowie-knife were swifter and as sure; Jordan was the\r\noubliette. There has been some attempt to deny the existence of the\r\nDanites or Destroying Angels who were Brigham Young’s executioners. That\r\nis futile, for the men, as I can testify, were as well known in Salt Lake\r\nCity as the Prophet, and the Old Man of the Mountain himself was not more\r\nfaithfully or more bloodily served by his _hashishin_ than was the Lion\r\nof the Lord by his band of bravos. There were wholesale murders like\r\nthe Mountain Meadow Massacre, but there were also other crimes, secret\r\nmurders actuated by private spite, jealousy or lust, the stories of which\r\nare well known to those behind the scenes in Zion. It was not healthy for\r\na man to incur the wrath of the Prophet or of the leading Saints. It was\r\nnot conducive to long life to love a maid or wed a wife upon whom the\r\neyes of one of the holy ones might have fallen.\r\n\r\nBrigham Young was a very different man from his predecessor, Joe Smith.\r\nBoth men were needed for the building up of this strange people. Joe\r\nSmith, as some pretend an epileptic, but in any case a fanatic, probably\r\nin the first instance believed in the dreams that he dreamed and the\r\nvisions that he saw. To convince others a man must first convince himself.\r\n\r\nA Mohammed has faith in himself and founds a religion professed by\r\ncountless millions. A Grand Cophta Cagliostro believes in nothing—least\r\nof all in himself—and dies miserably in the Castle of San Leone. Joe\r\nSmith could never have obtained the steadfast adherence of the men who\r\nrallied round him, especially of so strong a man as Brigham Young, four\r\nyears older than himself, had he not possessed something of the faith\r\nwhich moves mountains. Moreover, his disciples were ready to die, and did\r\ndie, for their religion’s sake. The man who lays down his life for his\r\nfriends cannot be altogether damned as a wilful impostor.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there was very little of the inspired prophet about\r\nBrigham Young. He was essentially a ruler, an organizer, a law-giver.\r\nHis preaching was contemptible, but his strength of will inflexible;\r\nthat, and not any pretence to inspiration, was the secret of the power\r\nwhich he wielded. He was entirely uneducated, and rather seemed to\r\npride himself upon the fact, but he was an admirable worker and had a\r\nknowledge of several crafts besides that of painter and glazier, which\r\nwas his immediate business before joining Joe Smith. This served him in\r\ngood stead on the great trek; as a carpenter he helped to build anything\r\nthat might be needed from a boat to a tabernacle, and he was of great\r\npractical utility when the New Zion was in course of erection.\r\n\r\nAs an organizer and business man he excelled. Under his guidance\r\nindustries of all kinds sprang up in the new community; he started\r\nco-operative stores, banks and places of business. Schools were\r\nestablished, even schools of music and dancing academies, for the Lion\r\nof the Lord was himself a great dancer, and it was said that the austere\r\nman would even condescend to perform in a breakdown. The drama was a\r\npassion with him, so it was not long before a theatre was built. His own\r\ntrading was carried out on excellent principles. He bought cheaply and\r\nsold dearly, even succeeding in getting the better of the United States\r\nCommissariat Department. The Saints used to boast with pride of the\r\nwealth of their Prophet. He was a sound financier, deeply penetrated by\r\nthe truth of the maxim, “Les affaires sont l’argent des autres.”\r\n\r\nSuch poor thunders as the Jupiter of the United States hurled at him\r\npassed harmlessly over his head. Often, standing at the helm of the State\r\nwhich he had created, he defied the supreme power, dauntless and unmoved.\r\nApart from all the crimes and all the baser sides of his character it is\r\nimpossible to deny that he had many of the qualities which go to make a\r\nstatesman. If he was a destroyer he was also a constructor, and the New\r\nZion as I saw it in 1873 was his work, and his alone.\r\n\r\nThe sun was dipping in the western sky as we were carried past the pretty\r\nshores of the Great Salt Lake, a glorious metallic sheet glowing with\r\nrosy light. In the distance were the Wahsatch Mountains rich in beauty,\r\nsilver and swindles, and as we drew near there was a pink haze over the\r\nZion of the Saints. The houses, each standing in its own little orchard,\r\nwith the fruit trees in the full bloom of spring-time, reminded me\r\nof some Eastern city. There was only one shrieking ugliness, the huge\r\ntabernacle with its great oblong white roof shaped like a dish cover—a\r\nmonstrosity upon which ingenuity had spent itself in the successful\r\nendeavour to produce something which should defy the world to show\r\nanything equally hideous.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon homes, when we reached them, were commonplace enough, but\r\nthe general effect of one great riotous luxury of blossom seen in the\r\nopalescent light of that lovely gloaming was a dream. Blushing behind\r\nso fair a veil the meanest buildings became glorified. Next morning,\r\nno doubt, we should be affronted by the newness of a city which some\r\ntwenty-five years ago had sprung out of a wilderness that could show\r\nnothing more imposing than a sage-bush; but the glamour of this April\r\nevening transfigured everything in a glory of rosy light.\r\n\r\nWe were lucky in having as our travelling companion Mr. McCook, the\r\nGovernor of Colorado, with whom we had struck up an alliance, and Colonel\r\nSteinberger, who, it was said, was the bearer of a not very pleasant\r\nmessage from President Grant to the Prophet, Brigham Young. Captain\r\nForbes, who had gone before, met us at the station, and led the way to\r\nthe Walker House Hotel, where we were comfortably lodged. The Walker\r\nbrothers were remarkable men in Zion. Hailing from Yorkshire, they had,\r\nupon the ruin of their father, emigrated as boys to the United States\r\nand found their way to Salt Lake City, where they joined the Mormon\r\ncommunity, of which they had learned something in the old country. They\r\nwere as poor as Lazarus, but by steady industry and integrity they became\r\nwealthy merchants, prospering greatly.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when they grew disgusted with the Prophet, his\r\nteachings, and his pretensions. They were boycotted and persecuted in\r\nevery way, but they held good, and ended by largely breaking the tyranny\r\nof Brigham Young, hitting him hard by the _argumentum ad crumenam_, and\r\ndamaging the co-operative society which he had started in opposition\r\nto them and to the various Gentile firms, the front of whose doors was\r\npatrolled by Mormon police, taking note of any ill-advised Saint who\r\nmight try to do business with them.\r\n\r\nThe following morning—May the 1st—we were up betimes and went for a drive\r\nwith a Mr. Stanford, for whom I had a letter of introduction. At the foot\r\nof the Wahsatch Mountains, on an eminence overlooking the plain, stood\r\nCamp Douglas, where a park of United States artillery dominated the town\r\nabout two miles off—a standing threat against any violence on the part of\r\nBrigham Young and his Latter-day Saints.\r\n\r\nThe site was chosen in 1862 by Colonel Connor at the time when incidents\r\narising out of the murder by the Mormons of the rival prophet Morris, a\r\npoor, half-crazy Welshman, rendered it necessary for the United States\r\nGovernment to bid the Saints behave themselves. However degrading for a\r\nprophet it might be to have the guns of his country’s army turned upon\r\nthe windows of his harem, there the battery remained, ready at a moment’s\r\nnotice to blow the whole hierarchy of the Saints, their wives, and their\r\nhomesteads into the next world. The officers gave Oliver a soldier’s\r\nwelcome, and were most civil and courteous to us. But how they hated the\r\nMormons, and how one felt the delight that it would be to them to receive\r\norders to bombard the Eagle House, the Beehive House and the whole\r\ndetested city of lies, the “City of Confusion”!\r\n\r\nBut those orders were not likely to come, for the Government of the\r\nUnited States never made up their minds to deal effectively with the\r\ndanger within their gates, and even the so-called Mormon war was but\r\na very half-hearted affair. Instead of boldly taking in hand what was\r\nreally high treason against the Stars and Stripes, successive Presidents\r\nsheltered themselves behind the responsibility of the individual State\r\nconcerned, in order to shirk what was the duty of the Federation.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went with Governor McCook to visit Brigham Young at\r\nthe Beehive House. We were shown into quite a modest parlour such as\r\nyou might find in a well-to-do farmhouse or humble Scottish manse. No\r\nluxury, no sign of any artistic refinement, no pictures, no books. The\r\nProphet prided himself on a sublime contempt for study in any shape.\r\nThere were one or two elders in the room, waiting, like ourselves, for\r\nan audience of the Lion of the Lord, who presently appeared. He was big\r\nand burly, not conspicuously tall, but broad-shouldered and massive. He\r\nwas seventy-one years of age, but looked much younger, for he had plenty\r\nof wavy fair hair turning grey, and his face was framed in what used to\r\nbe called in London slang, “a Newgate fringe.” Had it not been for a\r\nmarvellously strong lower jaw indicating the iron will which had carried\r\nhim through so many dangers and difficulties, he would have passed\r\nunnoticed in a crowd; but the square jaw and chin, the firmly-set lips,\r\nand a certain ominously suspicious look in the rather colourless eyes\r\nspoke volumes.\r\n\r\nHe looked what he was—a master, and a cruel master to boot. He was\r\ndressed in a frock coat of black broadcloth, a concession, as it was\r\nsaid, to the whim of a recently wedded wife, to win whose consent he had\r\nbeen compelled to plead sartorially in a way quite unusual to him, for\r\nthe lady objected to the home-spun suit which had been good enough for\r\nhim till her rule began. He was a very common man, vulgar and uneducated,\r\nbut his whole appearance indicated force, dogged determination, a\r\nstubborn inflexibility. “I am and will be governor,” he once said in\r\na sermon, “and no power can hinder it, until the Lord Almighty says,\r\n‘Brigham, you need not be Governor any longer.’”[34] Those words summed\r\nup the whole character of the man, as it was written in his face. The\r\nstrength of a lion, the cunning of a weasel.\r\n\r\nOne of the twelve apostles who had come with us acted as master of the\r\nceremonies, and named Governor McCook and ourselves to the Prophet, who\r\nwas civil—for a prophet—but not genial nor making any pretence of being\r\npleased to see us. When the Governor addressed him as “Mr. Young” he\r\nforgot his show of urbanity for a moment, and gave McCook a look which\r\nin the days of miracles should have withered him up as the worm smote\r\nJonah’s gourd. The Prophet claimed to be called “Mr. President,” but how\r\ncould a high official of the United States give that title to any man\r\nsave one?\r\n\r\n“You carry your years well, Mr. Young,” said the Governor. “I suppose you\r\nattribute that to the fine, invigorating air of your mountains?”\r\n\r\n“Say rather, sir, to a mind at peace,” and with those words, uttered\r\nwith a sanctimonious snuffle, the poisonous look disappeared, and\r\nthe holy man turned up the whites of his eyes with an air of saintly\r\nbeatitude.\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my ears. The audacity of it! Did the man think\r\nthat we had never heard of the Mountain Meadow Massacre, and of Heaven\r\nknows how many other crimes with which his name was associated? If it be\r\ntrue that conscience is a question of digestion his digestion must have\r\nbeen perfect.\r\n\r\nWe were told that there had been a disagreeable interview that morning\r\nwith Colonel Steinberger and that the Prophet’s temper had been ruffled;\r\nat any rate, our visit was not very pleasant and there was no temptation\r\nto prolong it—indeed, the Lion of the Lord was evidently in a bad\r\nhumour, very much inclined to growl and show his teeth, so after a few\r\ncommonplaces we left him in his den. We had a further taste of his\r\nquality when we went to hear him preach.\r\n\r\nAs we walked through the Garden City we were joined by several Mormon\r\nnotables, amongst others by a well-known Danite, or Destroying Angel,\r\nwho very appropriately volunteered to show us over the cemetery. It\r\nwas impossible among the graves not to notice the frequency of the\r\ninscription, “Found dead in Jordan.” I asked the Angel how it was that\r\nso many men had fallen into the river in a community of Rechabites where\r\nsoberness was the strict rule. He grinned a significant and ghastly grin.\r\n“I guess they died in their boots.” Everybody who ever was in the West\r\nin the days described by Bret Harte knows the meaning of that euphemism.\r\nHow many booted men he personally had accounted for, if any, our Danite\r\nfriend did not say.\r\n\r\nBut the words of the Prophet were law and must be obeyed; persons\r\ninconvenient to himself or to the Church and its apostles and elders, for\r\nwhatever reason, political or domestic, must not block the way; so they\r\n“died in their boots.” The cemetery in Zion furnished something to think\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWe were hospitably invited into a bar-room kept by a gentile, where a\r\nUnited States judge asked us to “paint”—an expression derived from the\r\ntendency of whisky to promote high colour in the face and nose. After one\r\ncocktail another gentleman came in and said to me: “Pleased to know you,\r\nsir—will you paint?” I excused myself on the ground that I had just gone\r\nthrough the ceremony with the Judge. “What! not just a leetle sketch?”\r\nsaid my new friend, with his head persuasively on one side.\r\n\r\nForbes and I were very anxious to go up the Cottonwood Canyon and have a\r\nlook at the Emma and Flagstaff Silver mines, which had not long before\r\nbeen thrown on the London Market, highly over-capitalized. The Emma\r\nmine had been brought out under the ægis of General Schenk, the United\r\nStates Minister at the Court of St. James’s, the hero who also introduced\r\npoker into London Society. The Stock Exchange was quite taken in. It was\r\nimpossible that so high a personage as the diplomatic representative of\r\na great Power should give his name as director to a wildcat venture. The\r\nshares were greedily bought, inflated to 50 per cent. premium or more,\r\nand then collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe Flagstaff was fathered by one Williams, a very plausible benefactor\r\nof mankind, who, as was afterwards found out, had been a waiter at an\r\nhotel in San Francisco. It was a magnificent concern—paid 30 per cent.\r\ndividends on such shares as were first bought, and when all were sold it\r\nwas discovered that the dividend on the earlier shares had been paid out\r\nof the money subscribed, and the shares were not worth a lock of good\r\nMr. Williams’ hair. He, honest man, decamped with his spoils and was no\r\nmore heard of. His gains must have been considerable, for he had also\r\nlaunched another mine, with equal success to himself, equal disaster to\r\nthe shareholders.\r\n\r\nWe chartered a cart and a pair of horses and set out on a lovely drive\r\namong the mountains. Our teamster was a very amusing fellow, who, when\r\nhe found that Forbes was a naval man, interlarded his conversation with\r\nmuch sea-talk. All of a sudden, as we were slowly jaunting up the canyon,\r\nwe heard a pistol shot, and a bullet came singing its way close to our\r\nheads. Our driver stopped short. “Ah! that’s Bill Simmonds, he’s up the\r\ncanyon looking after a claim of his. He’s fired a shot across our bows,\r\nand maybe, if we don’t stop, the next shot will be some nearer.” So we\r\nwaited, and in a few seconds Mr. Simmonds appeared out of the scrub by\r\nthe road-side, very drunk, with a revolver in one hand and a whisky\r\nbottle in the other. He was grinning hospitality, and all he had stopped\r\nus for was to give us a drink. When we accepted he was delighted, swore\r\neternal friendship, declaring that we possessed every social and moral\r\nvirtue, and disappeared again into the bushes. We went on our way without\r\nfurther let or hindrance, and were shown over the two great swindles by\r\nthe most explanatory of managers.\r\n\r\nThe talk of one of those old-time mining bosses was quite an education\r\nin enthusiasm, and so, much edified, we wended our way back to Salt Lake\r\nCity. If we were not able to send a crumb of comfort to the victims\r\nin London we had at any rate had a delightful expedition in glorious\r\nscenery, drinking in an air that was almost as intoxicating as Mr.\r\nWilliam Simmonds’ whisky.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt, according to the geologists and mining experts, that\r\nthe beautiful mountains of the Cottonwood Canyon were rich in silver\r\nmines—therein lay the danger. Brought out as they were by very clever\r\nmanipulators, with abundant proof of the existence of the metal, they\r\ntook in some of the very elect in the City of London, and to the small\r\ninvestors, always captivated by the prospect of big dividends, they spelt\r\nruin. The poor parson, the widow, and the orphan, were specially created\r\nfor the benefit of promoters, as men of the Schenk and Williams type well\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday Forbes and I went to hear the Prophet preach. In the huge,\r\nugly tabernacle, capable, as we were told, of holding nine thousand\r\npeople, we were shown to the gentiles’ bench, just underneath Brigham\r\nYoung, who glared at us in the most hostile way. There was some singing\r\naccompanied by an organ, not bad in its way, for music is one of the arts\r\nwhich the Saints cultivate, the children being all taught to sing in\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nBut the portion of the service which interested us the most was, of\r\ncourse, the sermon. Brigham Young was no orator, he had no sacred spark\r\nof eloquence; his strength, as I have said before, lay in his power as\r\na leader and master; there he was matchless. His sermon was very poor,\r\nconsisting of the commonest platitudes interlarded with grotesquely\r\nbarbarized Old Testament phraseology. Just the sort of stuff that is\r\nspouted by the meanest of the Hyde Park ranters. All of a sudden\r\nhe stopped the current of a discourse which to us sounded almost\r\nblasphemous, leant over and, looking us straight in the face, burst into\r\na violent inflammatory tirade against England. Quite forgetting the way\r\nin which he had once been received, when, as he said himself on a former\r\noccasion, he landed in our island penniless and without a friend, he\r\nlashed himself into a fury of abuse of everybody and everything that was\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nIt was miserably poor stuff, but probably good enough for the purpose of\r\nkindling the hatred of his audience against us; it would not have been\r\nswallowed by the lowest and most ignorant socialism in England. It was\r\nviolent, truculent, absolutely unreal; I felt all the time as if the\r\nman were out-talking his own reason. One passage was very amusing. He\r\nlooked at me with a fixed stare—shaking his forefinger at me, and said:\r\n“I often wish that I had the power of Queen Victoria or Mr. Gladstone for\r\nforty-eight hours. I guess” (here he paused)—“Yes! I’m a Yankee, I am,\r\nand therefore I guess—I would soon see whether millions upon millions of\r\nacres should lie fallow and bare in order that a parcel of idle noblemen\r\nmay _PUR_sue pheasants with their dogs!” I know not how to express the\r\nstress which he laid upon the _pur_ in _pursue_ save by printing it in\r\ncapital letters. When he had reviled England to his satisfaction he\r\nturned to an exposition of the beauties of the Mormon faith. Here again\r\nhe was not happy, though his none too classical language was remarkable\r\nas showing the truth of what has always been said of his loyal devotion\r\nto and faith in the first Prophet and Founder of Mormonism.\r\n\r\nHe said: “I have often wondered why it was that God Almighty chose Joseph\r\nSmith, the poor uneducated farmer’s boy, to be the means of revealing\r\nHis Will to His people. I can only suppose that it was because He wanted\r\na white sheet of paper to write upon.” The image was not new, and not\r\nparticularly reverent or refined; but when he spoke of Joseph Smith I\r\ncould not but feel that there was in all that he said, in the tone of his\r\nutterance, something of faith, and more than faith, love, which, in a man\r\nso strong and of so coarse a fibre, was infinitely touching, infinitely\r\npathetic. He spoke in tears, and made me forget the cant and vulgarity\r\nof the rest of his discourse; for if Brigham Young was not eloquent he\r\nwas at any rate a master of coarse abuse.\r\n\r\nThere is a speech of his against a federal judge who had attacked\r\npolygamy, in which he is said to have “roared” a flood of abuse before\r\nwhich Billingsgate must hide its head in the shame of defeat. It winds\r\nup with a grand peroration: “If you or anyone else is such a baby calf,\r\nwe must sugar your soap to coax you to wash yourself Saturday nights! Go\r\nhome to your mammy straight away, and the sooner the better!”[35]\r\n\r\nBrigham Young never claimed to have received more than one revelation and\r\nthat was, as its first verse says, “the Will of the Lord concerning the\r\nCamp of Israel in their journeyings to the West.” It was really, so far\r\nas the first part is concerned, a military order regulating the conduct\r\nto be observed on the march from Council Bluffs in 1847. The latter\r\npart is worth reading as a specimen of a style which was anything but\r\nattractive even in a considered document, but which in the pulpit became\r\nrepellent. The congregation, however, were not a critical audience.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the Saints were not such as would appeal to men of\r\neducation, and I can honestly say that, although I became personally\r\nacquainted with a good many Mormons, I did not find one with whom it\r\nwould have been possible to hold an intelligent conversation on any\r\nquestion outside of his own particular business or that of the Community.\r\n\r\nI am speaking of my own experience in the early seventies; I am told\r\nby those who have been in Utah more recently that things have not\r\nchanged. If the preachers of Mormonism are twitted with this, the answer\r\nis naturally: “If we are poor and uneducated so were the Apostles of\r\nChristianity”; but they forget that the Apostles founded a faith which\r\nhas been for centuries the religion of the most civilized and cultured\r\nportion of the world, whereas the Mormons have existed for nearly a\r\ncentury without making a single convert of note. And yet a century, short\r\nas the time is in comparison to the twenty centuries of Christianity,\r\nhas in these days of rapid communication given them opportunities of\r\nspreading, such as Christianity did not possess until many hundred years\r\nafter its birth. Mormonism is growing and is now (1915) said to number\r\nover four hundred thousand members. But these are still confined to the\r\nignorant classes. No scholar could be won by the book of Mormon.\r\n\r\nAs regards material prosperity Salt Lake City was already, when I saw\r\nit, a triumph, and in all the Community, if what men said was true, no\r\nman was more prosperous than Brigham Young. One gentile—a very moderate\r\nman—told us that the Prophet had entered upon speculations of every sort.\r\nIf they succeeded they belonged to him, if they failed to the Church,\r\nan easy and profitable way of doing business. If he did not have every\r\ncomfort that his heart could desire it was his own fault. He lived in\r\nwhat to him, I suppose, was a sort of luxury in the Beehive House,\r\nhis wives in the larger Eagle House—and the two were joined by a low\r\nbuilding in which were his offices. His Court consisted of a dentist in\r\nordinary—doctors he could not abide.\r\n\r\nThe last time that I saw this wonderful man, who certainly must be\r\nreckoned as one of the most striking apparitions of his century, was at\r\nthe theatre, of which, as I have said, he was an assiduous patron—indeed\r\nit was reported that he himself was fond in his lighter moods of taking\r\npart in theatricals. That he lived not a few tragedies is certain, but\r\nit is difficult to think of that grim man in sock or buskin, or even to\r\nbelieve that he could have any “lighter moods.”\r\n\r\nThe grand tier was filled with the wives of the much-wedded Saints; but\r\nwhere were the lovely ladies over whose charms Messrs. Cannon and Knapp\r\nhave wasted so much printer’s ink? There must have been two or three\r\nhundred women present, all of them apparently recruited from the slums of\r\nLondon and Liverpool, Scandinavia, and, as we were told in the case of a\r\nfew, from Germany. The harems of the Mormons were no temptation to the\r\nGentile.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we left Salt Lake City. There is in Messrs. Cannon\r\nand Knapp’s book a photograph of the town as it is to-day. The\r\npicturesqueness which struck me so much appears to have been largely\r\nimproved off the face of the earth. Instead of the lowly but comfortable\r\nhouses standing in their own gardens the streets are bordered by huge\r\nmany-storied buildings scraping the sky—those monstrosities of which\r\nAmerica is so proud. It seems a sorry thing that the old patriarchal\r\nsimplicity of the place which made its beauty should have been ruthlessly\r\ntorn down by the almighty dollar. I left Zion the richer in that I had\r\nhad a personal interview with a prophet and hobnobbed with a Destroying\r\nAngel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVADA AND CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nFurther and further west! Forbes and I were bound to see Virginia City in\r\nNevada, where the colossal mining industries were turning out fortunes.\r\nJohn Mackay, the Silver King, a right good fellow with whom I kept up\r\na friendship for many years, was the head of the firm of Mackay, Fair,\r\nFlood and O’Brien, a group of Irishmen, and they were the kings of the\r\nplace. Forbes knew them well, so we were sure of a good reception.\r\n\r\nAt the railway station we found the famous Curly Bill, a charioteer of\r\ngreat renown who drove his team of six horses at a breakneck pace up\r\nhill and down hill, round corners where the slightest mistake would have\r\nmeant being hurled down a precipice Heaven knows how deep, for the road\r\nhugged the face of the rock—on one side the dead wall of the mountain,\r\non the other eternity. He must have had nerves of steel. Curly Bill was\r\na good-natured giant, very full of talk. In his humorous way he spun\r\nmany yarns about the old days of camp life among the wild devils of whom\r\nforty-one years ago there were still a good few to be found. He had much\r\nto say about the swift and summary justice of the Vigilance Committees,\r\nof which we gathered, though he did not admit it in so many words, that\r\nhe had been a prominent member. Judge Lynch was the only power capable of\r\nmaintaining law and order in those stormy days, for the arm of the United\r\nStates was not long enough to reach the far away camps. Besides, the\r\nminers had little respect for the procedure of the courts; there was too\r\nmuch corruption and too much delay.\r\n\r\nI thought of “The Tombs,” the famous prison in New York, where I had seen\r\neighteen murderers—among them Stokes, who killed Jem Fiske, the partner\r\nof Jay Gould—all waiting month after month to be tried, condemned, or\r\nbought off. I remembered how Stokes told me that he had been deprived\r\nof his daily walk in the prison yard, and when I asked the reason, he\r\nanswered, “Oh, politics; in New York everything is politics!” He had good\r\ncause to say so, for politics saved his neck in the end. I could not but\r\nfeel that there was much to be said for the Vigilance Committees. There\r\nmust be some protection for life and property, and I believe that they\r\nseldom, perhaps never, acted without just cause. It was a case of a quick\r\ntrial, a short shrift, and the nearest tree! The members of the Committee\r\nas well disguised as the executioners of the Holy Office, and they worked\r\nin secret, under oath, but I fancy they were pretty well known, all the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThree or four years ago I saw the death of Curly Bill recorded with no\r\nlittle regretful praise in the _Times_. He was in his way a celebrity;\r\neverybody who knew the country round about Carson liked him and he would\r\nbe greatly missed. It was a delight to look upon his good, wholesome,\r\nhonest face, to listen to his straight talk, and watch the strong skill\r\nof his coachmanship.\r\n\r\nVirginia City was quite a small, scattered place, perched like an eagle’s\r\nnest among the mountains, just big enough to hold a few hundred miners,\r\na bar or two, and a small hotel. The first thing that struck me was\r\nthe great number of well-dressed, well-to-do loafers hanging about the\r\nstreets, apparently with no work and no interest in life. I asked what\r\nit meant. “Them fellows is all rich miners,” said Curly Bill, “everyone\r\nof them has a share in the mine in which he works. It’s their time off\r\nnow—they work eight hours, sleep eight hours, and loaf eight hours—yes,\r\nsir! presently those men will all be going on their shift, and working\r\nnaked to the waist, with nothing on but a pair of cotton drawers and\r\ntheir shoes, down a couple of thousand feet or thereabouts, in a heat\r\nwhich would make Hell ashamed of itself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fair was the only one of the four magnificos who happened to be in\r\nVirginia City at the time of our visit: he was the most genial of hosts,\r\nand we dined with him that evening; he lived in the simplest fashion\r\nin a small white house with green shutters at one end of the town. The\r\norder of architecture was that of the cheap toy doll’s house—a door in\r\nthe middle, windows on each side—a ground floor and first floor and of\r\nnecessity a roof. There was one maid-servant, and kind, handsome Mrs.\r\nFair cooked the dinner, over which, after a slight change of toilette,\r\nshe presided with all the grace of a charming hostess. An excellent leg\r\nof mutton and a rice-pudding composed the bill of fare. That was the\r\nfrugal way in which this rich gentleman, worth millions of dollars—indeed\r\nof pounds—lived while he was at work, and that was how the great\r\nmillionaire ladies seconded their husbands; when their day came they knew\r\nhow to be magnificent. It is almost impossible for us Englishmen to think\r\nof another lady who in all the bloom of her youth and beauty did the\r\nwashing for her husband’s camp, and later in life girded at the pettiness\r\nof the authorities of Paris for not allowing her to buy or even to hire\r\nthe Arc de l’Étoile in order that she might more brilliantly illuminate\r\na great entertainment! But those were the changes and chances of the\r\nlives of those who worked in such places as Poker Flat or Roaring Camp.\r\nPatriarchal simplicity followed by a prodigality exceeding even what the\r\nvats and mash-tubs of the great brewers could aspire to.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of Jem Fair (Slippery Jem, as he was called; why, I\r\nknow not, for he was as straight and upright as the Nelson Column, but\r\nin the old mining days every man had a nickname, whether it fitted or\r\nnot), we were shown much that the ordinary, haphazard traveller has no\r\nopportunity of seeing. He took us down the famous Consolidated Virginia\r\nMine, where, far down in the bowels of the earth, we saw men stripped\r\nto the waist, working for dear life, hacking out wealth from the solid\r\nrock, like the Nibelungen of the Rhine Legends. Curly Bill had given the\r\nheat no more than its due. The half naked miners were streaming with\r\nperspiration, and we were glad when the lift swung us up again out of the\r\nrich gloom of Tartarus into the bright air of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of the mine was stupendous. Fair told me that much of it\r\nwas imported from England. He said that it was only in England that they\r\ncould rely upon the truthfulness of the make. Things have changed in the\r\nlast forty years! Now we hear of steel rails being bought for England in\r\nAmerica; then it was only the British manufacturer who could be trusted\r\nto produce the most important articles needed by the miners, such as\r\nsteel belts, for instance.\r\n\r\nJem Fair’s talk, like that of all men who have done something in the\r\nworld, was worth listening to, and he had a way of expressing the shrewd\r\ncommonsense of his opinions in short, compact sentences that were almost\r\nepigrams. I recollect an answer of his which was very much to the point.\r\nSomeone asked him what were the prospects of a certain mine which had\r\njust been started; he replied: “Well, sir, a miner can see no further\r\nthan the end of his pick.” It was a golden rule with him that a man\r\nshould not invest money in a concern too remote for him to have any voice\r\nin its management. He made his millions in the mines which he controlled;\r\nhe invested them in real estate in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nTo a young Englishman who wished to follow his lead he said: “No,\r\nsir, you’re too far off.” “But,” said the Englishman, “see how you’ve\r\nsucceeded.” “Yes, sir, but I’m here.” There was all the wisdom of\r\na financial Solomon in that little word “here,” and the look which\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nI saw Jem Fair again in the autumn, when he urged me to go and see him\r\nbefore returning home. I wonder why it is that one seems to know a man\r\nbetter if one sees him twice with an interval than if one were to spend\r\nthe same length of days or hours with him at one spell? Anyhow, I grew\r\nvery fond of Fair, and heard from him fitfully till his death. He became\r\nSenator for Nevada, but never took kindly to politics, and I think the\r\nhappiest days of his life were those of the old mining outfit before he\r\nhad become a great money potentate, after which wealth and sorrow and\r\nmany cares weighed upon him heavily.\r\n\r\nWhen we were on the railway, bound for San Francisco, we had a little\r\ntaste of the life of the Wild West. At a roadside station a great,\r\nburly man got into the car, very rough, very dirty, very drunk and very\r\nquarrelsome. Things had apparently not gone smoothly with him, and he\r\nwas thirsting for the blood of an enemy, failing whom, brandishing a\r\nrevolver, he declared himself determined to slay someone in the car. His\r\nlanguage was savage, indecent, and blasphemous. The women began to scream\r\nand hide their children in their petticoats; but as quick as thought\r\nthe guard, a tiny little man, went up to the big bully twice his size,\r\ndisarmed him and turned him out cowering at the next station. Not much of\r\nan adventure, but characteristic of the place and time.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco was amazing. It is probably much more marvellous now, since\r\nits resurrection from the ruins of the great earthquake. But to me, who\r\ncould recollect the gold fever in the forties, when I was old enough to\r\ntake interest in the pictures of the _Illustrated London News_—the only\r\nillustrated paper out at that time—it seemed simply miraculous to see\r\nthat city of palaces risen barely twenty-five years before out of the\r\nsand-heaps of the Pacific Coast. The greatest marvel of all were the men.\r\n\r\nI had letters for Mr. Ralston, the manager of the Bank of California;\r\nMr. Gänsel, the agent of the Rothschilds, and others; and through their\r\ngood offices I made the acquaintance with most of the heroes whose toil\r\nand industry had landed them winners in these great welter races of\r\nprosperity. It is notorious that new communities, especially those where\r\nthere are pigeons ready for the plucking, attract the failures of the\r\nworld, the flotsam and jetsam of the sea of rascaldom. The worst case\r\nthat I ever came across was Port Said in 1870, where the griffins on\r\ntheir way out to India, and older men homeward bound on furlough, who\r\nmight be accredited with having shaken such poor remnants of fruit as\r\nmight yet hang here and there on the pagoda tree, fell easy victims to\r\nthe croupiers of the hells and the sirens of the _cafés-chantants_. San\r\nFrancisco, in its salad days, was no exception to the rule. Gamblers,\r\nprofessors of poker, of euchre and other games, were there by the\r\nhundred; bullies, and swindlers, men living upon their wits, but chiefly\r\non the lack of wits in others; hawks ready to pounce upon any simple\r\nminer with brains lighter than his pouch who might come under the clutch\r\nof their talons. Evil men enough and to spare, but happily many more good\r\nones, rare pioneers, endowed with that grip and holdfast purpose which\r\nhave raised the United States to their proud position among the nations\r\nunder the sun.\r\n\r\nSitting in the luxurious hall of the Occidental Hotel, it was strange\r\nto hear some of the older men talk of the bygone times, when they lived\r\nin huts that were sent out to them in pieces from the Eastern States\r\nround Cape Horn, to be delivered through the Golden Gates and put up in\r\nthe old Spanish Town; and those log cabins meant soft comfort after the\r\nhardships of camp life, and the toil of the hunt for gold.\r\n\r\nJohn Mackay was one of the first men to call upon me, and we were much\r\ntogether. We used generally to have luncheon and dine at some restaurant.\r\nFor the former being a one-idea man his order was always the same, given\r\nwith a brogue, and a comic little stammer which were very amusing.\r\n“Waiter! let us have a t-t-tenderloin steak and let it be cooked r-rare!”\r\nIn spite of Dryden’s authority, I never could get quite used to the word\r\n_rare_ in that sense. At last one day I said to him: “Mackay, you are\r\nan Irishman, and of course you know Moore’s ‘Irish Melodies.’ Do you\r\nremember that lovely song which begins: ‘Rich and underdone were the gems\r\nshe wore’?” Mackay laughed, but he continued to order his steak “r-rare.”\r\nHe was one of the simplest and kindest of men, with not a particle of\r\npurse-pride about him; just as modest and unpretentious as he was when\r\nas a lad he owned little more than the clothes he stood in; and now,\r\nstill a comparatively young man, he had achieved riches which made him\r\na real power in the world. A man who, among other ventures, can start a\r\ntrans-Atlantic cable off his own bat, is something to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nKind as everybody in San Francisco was to the stranger that was within\r\nhis gates, none was more hospitable than my poor friend Ralston. It was\r\nnot only that he was lavish of expenditure. That in the ’Frisco of those\r\ndays was nothing. Everybody threw money out of the window—the more the\r\nbetter. He was lavish of painstaking thoughtfulness for the comfort\r\nand pleasure of his friends; lavish of genuine and heartfelt kindness;\r\nlavish of a welcome which I felt was a joy to himself and which therefore\r\ncould be accepted as it was offered. He organized the most delightful\r\nexpeditions for the benefit of his many guests—long drives into the\r\nglorious mountain scenery, with three or four teams of four horses in\r\nreadiness for a change at various points, and everything that forethought\r\ncould devise for our comfort.\r\n\r\nAmong his guests whom I met almost daily was Mr. Blaine, the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and the sworn foe of England. There was\r\nno such Anglophobe in all the United States and though perhaps it was\r\nnot in the best of taste to show his antipathy in our presence, he lost\r\nno opportunity of doing so. However, I was determined not to be drawn,\r\nand so gradually he became tamer. At the last, when after a few days we\r\nsaid good-bye, he said, “Well, Mr. Mitford, there are at any rate two\r\nthings in England of which you may be proud. A House of Commons in which\r\nthe courtesy and self-restraint are a model for the world, and a Press\r\nwhich never is inquisitorial in men’s private affairs.” Soon after I got\r\nback to England the editor of a “Society Paper” was put in prison for\r\nlibel, and the House of Commons had started upon its all-night sittings\r\nunder the lead of Mr. O’Donnell, Mr. Biggar, and others. I should hardly\r\nlike, as an Englishman, to write down the opinion expressed by some of my\r\nAmerican friends upon Mr. Speaker Blaine. It would be taking a leaf out\r\nof his book.\r\n\r\nOne of our drives was to the country house of Mr. D. O. Mills, the\r\nfather-in-law of that most distinguished Ambassador, Mr. Whitelaw\r\nReid. Mr. Mills’ house and surroundings were as beautiful as might be\r\nexpected in the midst of some of the most lovely scenery in the world.\r\nHe was the President of the Bank of California, and no man was more\r\nrespected. He had a great collection of modern pictures, many of which\r\nwere old acquaintances of previous years in the Royal Academy, and\r\nelsewhere. Kind, genial, and courteous, he made us very welcome in his\r\nbeautiful home. His daughter, at whose house I saw him again when she was\r\nAmbassadress in London, was then a very little girl in short petticoats.\r\n\r\nNot long after I left San Francisco came the tragedy of the Bank of\r\nCalifornia. The old story, mismanagement, a crash, ruin. Mr. Mills, who\r\nin the meantime had given up his position in the bank, stepped into the\r\nbreach, went heroically into harness again, and pulled round the concern.\r\nPoor Ralston could not face the shame. He died of a broken heart, a\r\nsuicide in the foul water of the docks of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAll California rang with the praise of Mr. Mills and admiration for\r\nhis self-sacrifice. A grateful American gentleman once said: “You see\r\nthat gentleman there—well, that’s D. O. Mills. He’s worth millions upon\r\nmillions of dollars, and there is not a dirty coin among them.” A grand\r\ntribute!\r\n\r\nBefore sailing again westward until the furthest East should be reached,\r\nit was a solemn duty to make a pilgrimage to the Yosemite Valley. What\r\nlover of trees could leave California without having seen the great\r\nWellingtonias? The trip is probably made much easier now, but forty\r\nyears ago a great deal of red dust, as fine and all-penetrating as the\r\nblack dust of a sand storm from the desert of Gobi, at Peking, had to be\r\nswallowed before reaching the goal.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular saying that the teamsters of California, by a natural\r\nprocess, developed gizzards to enable them to digest the quantities of\r\ngrit which they had to swallow. But the beauty of the country through\r\nwhich we travelled paid for all, and a bath, with a long, cool drink\r\nof many ingredients in crushed ice, prepared by the cunning hands of\r\nPublic-spirited Smith, the famous barman of the Valley, was a drink of\r\nthe water of Lethe, killing all memory of heat and that dust which adds\r\nso greatly to fatigue. But I was already under the spell, for as I rode\r\ninto the Yosemite Valley at nightfall the scene was striking. The huge,\r\neerie rocks, rising some two thousand feet sheer on either side, looked\r\nlike gigantic, black, threatening fortresses, built by the Titans in\r\ntheir war against the gods.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden a bright light began to search the gloom. I looked up,\r\nand just above the Bridal Veil Waterfall the full moon was rising. For\r\na few minutes it looked as if that thin, airy veil of the most delicate\r\ngossamer lace, waving from side to side in the gentlest of breezes, were\r\nbeing poured, a silvery stream, out of the very centre of the fairy\r\ndisc, scattering diamonds and opals as it touched the ground. I stopped\r\nmy horse and watched, half hoping that I, poor mortal, might surprise\r\nthe revels of the gnomes and fairies who surely must be holding high\r\nfestival among the moonlit patches in the thickets. Soon, in full glory,\r\nthe valley was lighted up, and I rode on, listening to the music of\r\nthe water, knowing that I had seen a sight full of mystery, the most\r\nbeautiful that ever had been or ever would be vouchsafed to my eyes.\r\n\r\nHow captivating is the charm even of the idea of beautiful scenery. Poor\r\nblind Bob Lowe, Lord Sherbrooke, used to say that the greatest enjoyment\r\nof which he was capable was that of travelling through beautiful\r\nscenery—beautiful scenery which he, unhappy man, never saw, but of which\r\nthe idea possessed him, dominated him as nothing else could. And what a\r\npity it was that he should have been so afflicted, for with his power of\r\nwords he would have brought home to us so much. There have been a few, a\r\nvery few, lords of language who have been able to describe, but even they\r\nare baffled by the masterpieces of God’s handiwork. Of these the Yosemite\r\nValley is one; it is too great for mere words; the most we can do is to\r\nfall down and worship in silence in one of God’s own cathedrals.\r\n\r\nI had just written the above lines about Lord Sherbrooke when, on turning\r\nover Aston’s “History of Japanese Literature” for a quite different\r\npurpose, I happened upon a quotation culled from the _Tsuré-Dzure-Gusa_\r\n(literally “Idle blades of grass” or “_obiter dicta_”) of Kenkō, a\r\nJapanese priest who lived in the fourteenth century, so appropriate that\r\nI feel inclined to quote his words. “It is not only when we look on the\r\nmoon or flowers with our eyes that they give us pleasure; but on a spring\r\nday, though we leave not the house, on a moonlight night, though we\r\nremain in our chamber, the mere thought of these cheers and delights.”\r\nMany wise, and, let me add, many pious thoughts, did the old priest who\r\ndied seven hundred years ago set down in writing, and they are as good\r\nto-day as when he wrote them.\r\n\r\nSomething of a _bon vivant_, too, in spite of his Buddhism, which ought\r\nto be so ascetic, was this dear old Kenkō (whose name before he entered\r\nreligion was Kanéyoshi), a man with a righteous respect for a cup of good\r\nwine and the joy of sharing it with a friend.\r\n\r\n“Two things fill my spirit with ever new and increasing admiration and\r\nawe the oftener and the more constantly my thoughts are occupied with\r\nthem: the star-studded heaven above me and the moral law within me.” So\r\nwrote Kant: had he seen them, he must have added as a third the giant\r\ntrees of California. To me they were more impressive than any of the\r\ngreat phenomena of Nature that I had seen. The vastness and the appalling\r\nroar of Niagara itself did not excite in me the same awe as did these\r\ngreat silent witnesses of the ages.\r\n\r\nHow old they might be I cared not. Their measurements left me\r\nindifferent. It was a wonder to see a great hollow tree lying on the\r\nground, to ride in on horseback at one end and out at the other. But\r\nthat was not what moved me; you cannot measure majesty, and when I saw\r\nthese great sequoias towering above the pines[36] which would themselves\r\nhave been Brobdingnagian anywhere else, the sense of majesty was almost\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\nThere are few subjects upon which more nonsense has been talked and\r\nwritten than there has been about the age of trees. Some years ago I\r\nsaw a letter written to the _Times_ (I think) about a catalpa tree in\r\nGray’s Inn Garden, which was said to have been planted by Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh (the catalpa, by the by, was first introduced into England in the\r\nyear 1726!), and in that letter the writer alluded to the sequoias or\r\nWellingtonias, which he said must have been already mature trees “when\r\nAbraham was a little boy!” I felt how pleased that gentleman was with\r\nhimself when he concocted that phrase. Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. Carruthers\r\nand I once took the trouble to count accurately the rings on the section\r\nof the sequoia in the Natural History Museum. They numbered one thousand\r\nthree hundred and thirty-five. “This particular tree was sixty-two feet\r\nin girth at eight feet from the ground; three hundred feet high, and\r\nwithout branches for two hundred feet of its height.” (Veitch’s “Manual\r\nof Conifers.”) “From these and other authentic data,” says Veitch’s\r\nbook, “it is not unsafe to infer that none of the existing Wellingtonias\r\nantedate the Christian Era, or that with very few exceptions, the oldest\r\nof them reach within five hundred years of that epoch, whose ages,\r\ntherefore, do not much exceed that of the oldest yews in Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nThe yew is, as is well known, the oldest tree that we have; but here\r\nagain there is great exaggeration. I was once shown a yew tree in Hayling\r\nIsland which I was solemnly assured was standing there at the time of\r\nJulius Cæsar’s landing. That a yew tree stood there is very possible; but\r\nthat particular yew tree, no! I have seen a young tree growing out of an\r\nold one that was a mere hollow shell, the seed having germinated within\r\nit. Many a legend in regard to yews may have started in that way; the\r\nold host gradually rotting away to make room for the guest. Seedlings may\r\nrise close to the recorded tree and in the course of centuries be taken\r\nby ignorant or careless observers for it. As regards the age of oaks,\r\nthe old homely tradition is probably founded on something like fact.\r\nThree hundred years of growth, three hundred standing still—which is,\r\nof course, nonsense, for in this world nothing stands still—and three\r\nhundred years in which to decay. Dryden put it into verse.\r\n\r\n    “The monarch oak, the patriarch of trees\r\n    Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees:\r\n    Three centuries he grows, and three he stays\r\n    Supreme in state: and in three more decays.\r\n\r\n                             “PALAEMON AND ARCITE.”\r\n\r\nThat there are many ancient oaks, veterans battered by the storms\r\nof centuries, we well know; but a Wellingtonia of Abraham’s time is\r\nunthinkable; so are the legends of the Mount of Olives. Surely enough,\r\nthere are trees there, grey and gnarled, that are the descendants of\r\nthose under which our Lord preached. Some of them are hoary with age and\r\nmay have been a third, hardly a second, generation from those sacred\r\nancestors. But though standing on the holy mount I looked upon them with\r\nall the veneration, all the awe inspired by the divine traditions of the\r\nplace, I could not persuade myself that they were the very trees among\r\nwhich the Saviour had so often wandered. The oldest tree in the world\r\nof the planting of which there is any record, is the famous Bō tree of\r\nAnuradhapura, of which I shall tell later on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days later I was steaming out of the Golden Gates into the Pacific\r\nOcean—anything but pacific, as my experience went to show. For the first\r\nday or two mountainous fogs that looked so solid that we almost expected\r\nto hear the ship crash and be shattered to splinters as we charged into\r\nthem. Then a succession of gales, in one of which our starboard paddle\r\nwas smashed, and we had to steam the second half of our voyage steering\r\nagainst the remaining one. Not a pleasant experience, for we were in the\r\nmonth of June, and as the old rhyme in regard to typhoons goes, a risky\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n    June, coming soon.\r\n    July, mind your eye.\r\n    August, must.\r\n    September, remember.\r\n    October, all over!\r\n\r\nHowever, in time the old slowcoach of a walking-beam ship landed us in\r\nJapan, of which I need say nothing here.\r\n\r\nLooking back upon my sojourn in California, it is a sad thought that none\r\nof the men with whom I spent those happy days are left—my three English\r\ntravelling companions all gone—Mackay, Fair, Ralston, D. O. Mills, Curly\r\nBill and the rest all dead. I believe that Mrs. Whitelaw Reid is the only\r\nperson whom I knew out in the Far West who is yet alive. But she was a\r\nlittle child!\r\n\r\nThe return voyage across the Pacific was very pleasant. We had as\r\nshipmates several very agreeable Americans, among them Governor Lowe,\r\nthe U. S. Minister at Peking, and Mr. Lothrop, a Boston man, who had\r\nbeen in business in Japan and seemed to have read almost every book that\r\nwas worth reading. Governor Lowe (he had been Governor of California\r\nbefore entering diplomacy, and retained the title) was one of the best\r\n_raconteurs_ that I ever met. One day I asked him why it was that his\r\nstories were so incomparably better than anybody else’s. His answer was\r\ninstructive. “Well, sir! I’m going to tell you. You will notice that I\r\nnever tell a story about _a man_. Nobody wants to hear anything about\r\nthat _man_. He isn’t a circumstance. No, sir, when I tell you a story I\r\ntell it with a name and a place, and sometimes a date. If I don’t know\r\nthem I invent them. That gives the anecdote a living interest. That’s my\r\nsecret, sir, and I make you a present of it.”\r\n\r\nHe kept our small company very much alive for about three weeks, for he\r\nhad a fine dry wit of his own besides his memory. He was going back now\r\nafter having held high office to join a bank in ’Frisco. Such is America.\r\nHe and Lothrop are, alas! both gone. The sister of the latter, when he\r\ndied, sent me as a remembrance of him a book which he had loved, and\r\nthere is at this moment, ticking away in my drawing-room, a tiny clock\r\nwhich he gave me when I married. The ticking of that little clock often\r\ncarries me thousands and thousands of miles away into the cloud-land of\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nI found Forbes at Salt Lake City, and we determined to make a shooting\r\nexcursion in the Rocky Mountains before going East. We were assured that\r\nwe should have sport to our hearts’ content and we were told of a hunter\r\nand tracker beside whom Fenimore Cooper’s Pathfinder was a mere baby. The\r\nintimate secrets of the lair of the grizzly were an open book to him, and\r\nas for the lordly wapiti—well, we should see! There was no need to take\r\nany meat with us, for game would be plentiful and our larder would be so\r\nstocked that we should not know what to do with its contents. Encouraged\r\nby these grand assurances we engaged waggons and teams, and set out on\r\nour great _shikar_.\r\n\r\nIt was now October and the nights were bitterly cold. We had no tents,\r\nbut lay out in the open in our buffalo robes. We had some fine tramps\r\nover the mountains amid the most glorious scenery. But where were the\r\ndoomed grizzly bears? Where the vast herds of antlered wapiti? Not a\r\nspoor did we see during all the days that we were out; our famous tracker\r\nturned out to be an utter fraud and most unscrupulous liar; in spite of\r\nwhich he went on romancing, brazen and unashamed. It was impossible not\r\nto admire his audacity, it was so perfect. The worst of it was that,\r\nputting our faith in his promises, we took no meat with us; we had plenty\r\nof biscuits, potatoes, coffee and a little whisky; so far, our condition\r\nwas better than that of the Mormons on the great trek, and as we lay\r\nround the camp fire at night, we regaled ourselves in imagination with\r\nthe juicy venison steaks that ought to be frizzling in the frying-pan.\r\n\r\nMany miles we climbed and wandered, changing our camp every day. One\r\nevening an old sage-hen came and stood watching us about seventy or\r\neighty yards off. We had no scatter-guns with us, so I took a pop shot at\r\nher with my rifle and luckily got her; we cleaned her (very important to\r\ndo that at once, otherwise the strong taste of sage becomes intolerable),\r\nplucked her, cut her in little pieces and threw her into the stew-pot;\r\nthat impudent bird, nasty as she was, seemed like a dish from a feast of\r\nHeliogabalus.\r\n\r\nOne night it was my turn to keep the camp-fire going, and I ought to\r\nhave remained awake till the time should have come to put on new logs; I\r\nwas very tired, having had an unusually tall climb that day, and I fell\r\nasleep before even having cut the needful logs of dead wood. All of a\r\nsudden I awoke, roused by the rays of the moon, which was shining through\r\nthe trees—a lovely, weird sight. To my dismay I saw that the fire was all\r\nbut out. I had neglected my duty. I jumped up, took the axe, and began\r\ncutting down a dead birch tree which I had marked the evening before; my\r\nfingers were numb with cold, for it was freezing hard, and the axe more\r\nthan once turned in my grip. However, at last I got together some logs,\r\nwhich were soon crackling merrily above the ashes; then I thought that I\r\nwould make myself a cup of coffee to warm me.\r\n\r\nI went to the little stream—a mere runlet of water—now frozen quite hard,\r\nbroke some ice, melted it, and put it in the kettle to boil. When my\r\ncoffee was ready I heard a voice from under one of the buffalo robes:\r\n“Wal! Wal! Wal! Blame me if you ain’t got quite a nice cup of corfy! I\r\nguess I’ll come and have some.” It was the voice of one of the teamsters,\r\nwho had been watching me take all the trouble without even offering to\r\nlend a hand, and now claimed his share of what my labour had earned.\r\nI was savage, but it was no use showing it, for these men are very\r\nindependent, and if I had been sulky, he would have been off at daylight\r\nwith his waggon and team, leaving us to get on as best we could with\r\nthose that remained.\r\n\r\nOn our last evening, as hungry and disconsolate we sat shivering by the\r\ncamp fire, we were startled by the tinkling of a bell. It was a kind old\r\ncow who had strayed out into the wilderness and came to be milked. Was\r\nthere ever sweeter music or a more royal feast than what she brought us?\r\nMoreover she told us that we were nearing civilization.\r\n\r\nWe had had enough of this very barren hunting, tightening our girdles day\r\nby day, and breaking the ice night and morning; so we settled up with our\r\nteamsters and Ananias the hunter, caught a train at the wayside station,\r\nand steamed away to New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n1874\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK OPAL\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Ibam forte viâ sacrâ, sicut meus est mos,\r\n    Nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis,\r\n    Accurrit quidam.”\r\n\r\n                               Horace, Sat. I. 9.\r\n\r\nOne fine day at the end of April I was walking down the “sacred\r\nstreet” of St. James, as usual thinking of I know not what trifles,\r\nutterly absorbed in them, when I felt a tap upon my shoulder. I turned\r\nround—Gloster, by all that was unexpected! Colonel Gloster, to whom I\r\nhad bidden farewell at Point de Galle nine years before! It was a happy\r\nmeeting, and we stopped to chat for a moment, but he had a business\r\nappointment, so we agreed that he should come to dinner with me in my\r\nrooms in Victoria Street that evening. As we parted I said: “What a pity\r\nthat Overbeck should not be in England! We could have such a delightful\r\ntalk over the days of the Lion’s Den on board the _Simla_!” I hailed a\r\nhansom and trotted off to order dinner: on my table was Overbeck’s card!\r\n“Only in London for two days—when and where can I see you?” I lost no\r\ntime in going to look him up; found him by great good luck, and so it\r\nhappened that we three came together again on that April day after nine\r\nlong and strenuous years, during which neither of us had met, though we\r\nhad corresponded fitfully.\r\n\r\nOverbeck came to dinner in morning clothes, as he had parted somehow with\r\nhis heavy luggage, and I noticed that he had a curious stone, unknown to\r\nme, mounted as a pin in his cravat. I asked what it was. “A black opal,”\r\nwas the answer. I had lately been hearing all sorts of tales about the\r\nbad luck which opals are supposed to bring. White opals he admitted\r\nwere known to be unlucky, but the black opal, on the contrary, was the\r\nluckiest of stones. He insisted that I must buy one, and promised to call\r\nthe next morning and go with me to hunt for one.\r\n\r\nWe spent a merry evening; in the discussion of the happenings of nine\r\nyears there was much to ask and much to tell, for we had all three led\r\npretty busy lives in the interval, and it was late when we separated,\r\nwondering over the chance that had so strangely brought us together again.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Overbeck turned up, quite determined that I must\r\ngo and buy a black opal, as to which my enthusiasm had had time to wane\r\nduring the night; however, he would take no denial, and so off we went to\r\nmy old friend, Mr. Phillips, in Cockspur Street, the man who was really\r\nthe first to introduce the artistic feeling of the sixteenth century\r\ninto the modern jewellers’ craft. He was a man of the most consummate\r\ntaste and culture, qualities repeated with additional intensity in his\r\ndistinguished son, Sir Claude, the great critic, the accuracy of whose\r\njudgment and historical knowledge in all that concerns the fine arts is\r\nundisputed.\r\n\r\nI knew that the best chance of finding anything a little out of the way\r\nwould be in Mr. Phillips’ hands, and so it proved to be, for he at once\r\nshowed me the gem that I wanted, mounted as a pin with tiny sparks of\r\ndiamonds round it. He told me that he had shown it to the Prince of Wales\r\nand the Duke of Edinburgh; both admired its beauty, but neither of them\r\nwould buy it, on account of the evil reputation of the white opal.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, weird stone, with a mysterious spark of fire in the\r\ncentre, which seemed to gleam fitfully, almost capriciously. Overbeck\r\nlooked at it for a moment, trembling with excitement, and then hissed in\r\nmy ear: “Buy it! Buy it! It surely brings you luck.” I laughed at his\r\neagerness, but I bought the pin for its beauty’s sake. As we left the\r\nshop Overbeck, who was greatly excited, stopped on the threshold, and\r\nsaid: “In ten days you’ll get a letter, mark my words; in ten days, more\r\nor less.” We parted in Cockspur Street and he went abroad that evening.\r\nI went home, delighted with my pretty new toy, and thought nothing more\r\nabout the famous letter which I was to receive, when on the evening\r\nof the 9th of May, exactly ten days from the visit to Mr. Phillips, I\r\nreceived the following note:\r\n\r\n                       “10, Downing Street, Whitehall. May 9th, —74.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MR. MITFORD,\r\n\r\n    “If you like to become Secretary to the Board of Works I shall\r\n    have pleasure in appointing you.\r\n\r\n                           “Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                        B. DISRAELI.\r\n\r\n    “Bertram Mitford, Esq.”\r\n\r\nThat letter changed the whole course of my life.\r\n\r\nI wrote and congratulated Overbeck on his prophetic powers. His answer\r\nwas, “You will get anything you wish.”\r\n\r\nOne night at a party I told my future wife, Lady Clementine Ogilvy, the\r\nstory, and when three months later we were betrothed, I sought all over\r\nLondon for a black opal for her, but there was not one to be had; the\r\nfame of my stone had somehow or other been spread abroad and everybody\r\nwas mad to buy its fellow. When she went to Paris with her mother,\r\ntrousseau buying, I commissioned her to hunt for a black opal, which she\r\ndid, and brought home a beautiful specimen which she still has—and on the\r\nday that she bought it I concluded the purchase of the house in Chelsea,\r\nwhere we were to spend so many happy years.\r\n\r\nWe are old folk now, the ink of Dizzy’s note, which I treasure, has faded\r\nalmost into nothingness, and my poor black opal was stolen some seven\r\nyears ago by burglars—but not before it had well and truly done its\r\nappointed work.\r\n\r\nWe were married on the 31st of December, 1874, in the little chapel of\r\nCortachy Castle. Had the wedding been fixed for a day later there would\r\nhave been no bridegroom, for all the trains in Scotland were held up by\r\na terrific blizzard, and the New Year’s hampers were looted to feed the\r\npassengers, who were starved with cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding breakfast I told the story of the black opal to the\r\nlate Lord Southesk, a famous collector of gnostic gems, perhaps sharing\r\nBartolommeo Scala’s belief in the mystic virtues of precious stones. “Ah!\r\nwonderful!” he said. “How little we know about the influence of gems!\r\nPerhaps——” Someone interrupted, and to my regret he was prevented from\r\nfinishing the sentence. People said it was a very pretty wedding—and so\r\nit must have been, in that glorious old castle with the richly-wooded\r\nriver Esk running under its walls, as it had done for seven centuries—but\r\na bridegroom, I take it, does not see much on his wedding-day.\r\n\r\nThere was a goodly company—chiefly neighbours from such places as Glamis,\r\nKinnaird, Kinnordy, Kinblethmont, Balnaboth. Many Ogilvys and Stanleys,\r\nand an army of tenants and retainers. The host looked every inch a scion\r\nof the old Mormaers of Scotland, and the stately châtelaine, at whose\r\nhands the venerable home had received such loving care, proudly did the\r\nhonours, a queen among her guests. The sun shone out gaily after the\r\nstorm, the wild skirl of many bagpipes screamed in the courtyard, pibroch\r\nfollowed by pibroch, as we made ready to drive through the bright, crisp\r\nair to Airlie Castle. That was indeed a romantic setting for a honeymoon,\r\nand never looked more beautiful than during those sharp winter days. The\r\nriver was almost entirely frozen over, and on one great ice-block was\r\na dead salmon, half eaten by the otter which had dragged it there; the\r\ntrees were heavily laden, snow-icicles sparkling with all the colours\r\nof the rainbow; the red sandstone walls of the bonnie House of Airlie\r\nglowing in the sun—winter in all its glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n1875\r\n\r\nThe honeymoon was cut very short, for at the end of five days I was\r\nsummoned south. There was trouble at the Office of Works, and I must\r\nperforce get back into harness with all speed. And so we bade good-bye to\r\nAirlie Castle and the year 1874. It had been for me a bright and a joyous\r\nyear, in which there had not been an hour that was not full of hope, and\r\nof happiness which is the child of hope.\r\n\r\nFor a few months, while our house in Chelsea was getting ready for us, we\r\ncamped in my old quarters in Victoria Street. We had a bright welcome\r\nthere, for my dear old friend, Sir Joseph Hooker, had made the rooms gay\r\nwith flowers, and the dinginess of London was left outside.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July we migrated into our new home at Chelsea, a delightful\r\nhouse looking over the river, carrying up and down with the tide the\r\nbrown-sailed barges and all its picturesque movement, with the famous\r\ngreen copper spire of Battersea Church across the water, and the\r\ndelightful old wooden bridge, now vanished, which has been immortalized\r\nin Whistler’s etchings and nocturnes and harmonies. At the time when\r\nChelsea was “a village of palaces” Lindsey House had seen better days.\r\nIt was built on part of the site occupied by Sir Thomas More’s country\r\nplace, a site full of memories of the great Chancellor and Erasmus and\r\nAnne Roper. Here Holbein, introduced by Erasmus, lived until he had\r\npainted the portraits of his host and hostess and the whole family, down\r\nto Patenson the jester and the little dog.\r\n\r\nThen came a day when Sir Thomas, prudent man, seeing that there was\r\nnothing left to paint, began to think that a tame artist was an expensive\r\nluxury. How to get rid of him decently? The Chancellor was a man of\r\nresource. He gave a great garden-party which the King announced his\r\nintention of honouring. Up the river came the royal barge, with banners\r\nflying and trumpets braying, a brave pageant. At Chelsea the King\r\nalighted, and was received with all due honour just outside my house that\r\nwas to be. Old Sir John Tyrrell—a famous character at the Carlton Club\r\nsome fifty years ago, used to say: “Yes! I’ll go and stay with you on two\r\nconditions; first, that I breakfast at my own time, and secondly that I\r\nam not taken round to see the improvements.” Sir Thomas More spared King\r\nHenry VIII. none of the “improvements.” When with royal courtesy he had\r\nadmired the outside, His Majesty was taken within, and there, like the\r\ngreat judge that he was, he was smitten by the beauty of the glorious\r\ncanvases and panels which hung everywhere. “Is such a painter yet alive,\r\nand to be had for money?” he exclaimed, and Holbein was produced out of\r\na closet in which he lay hidden. The King was overjoyed. The painter’s\r\nfortune was made and the Chancellor’s weekly bills were reduced.\r\n\r\nNext, in Charles II.’s time, all the way from St. Martin’s Lane came Sir\r\nTheodore Mayerne, the confidential doctor of three kings, and he too\r\nwas a patron of art, for he set up a furnace and worked at enamelling\r\nwith Petitot the Swiss miniaturist, the excellence of whose flesh tints\r\nare said to have been due to the discoveries of the great medicine-man.\r\nWhen Sir Theodore died his house was pulled down and Lord Lindsey bought\r\nthe property and built himself a home with the river in front and a\r\ngarden at the back. There is some reason, based upon internal evidence,\r\nfor supposing that Sir Christopher Wren may have been the architect.\r\nThere are still remaining some of those ogival chimney-pieces such as\r\nhe introduced into Hampton Court; and what more likely than that the\r\nfamous Court architect should have built for the hereditary Lord Great\r\nChamberlain? Here dwelt his descendant, the Duke of Ancaster, with his\r\nbeautiful duchess, whose portrait was painted both by Hudson and by a\r\nfamous pupil of his, one Sir Joshua Reynolds. The beautiful portrait by\r\nHudson, with shipping in the distance, was painted to record the mission\r\nof the Duchess when she went to Germany to bring back Queen Charlotte.\r\n\r\nTo the Ancasters succeeded Count Zinzendorf, chief of the Herrenhuters,\r\nwhose burial-ground was at the back where the Moravian preacher’s pulpit\r\nwas not so very long ago still to be seen—indeed perhaps it may be there\r\nyet. After that the glory of the great house departed. It was divided\r\ninto five and was known as Lindsey Row. In the first of these in 1874\r\nlived Whistler, in the next, which had once been owned by Martin the\r\npainter, the illustrator of Milton, dwelt a Mr. Boggett, a great grower\r\nof chrysanthemums; then came Mr. Nassau Senior, who married the beautiful\r\nand charming sister of Tom Hughes (“Tom Brown’s School-days”), and the\r\nlast two were empty. Those two I bought and threw into one with the help\r\nof Mr. Devey the architect. And here we lived for many happy years.\r\n\r\nIf in London the last person with whom you are likely to make\r\nacquaintance is the man who is living next door to you, in Chelsea it was\r\nquite different; we were very neighbourly; the Nassau Seniors were most\r\nfriendly—she, unfortunately a great invalid, hardly leaving her sofa, but\r\nalways a ray of sunshine, brightening all the lives with which she came\r\nin contact; as for Whistler, he was perpetually in and out of our house,\r\nand always welcome for the spirit of fun and devilry which he brought\r\nwith him. He would come in of a morning with a whole budget of papers,\r\nletters, of which many were afterwards published in “The Gentle Art of\r\nMaking Enemies,” which he would read out to us, exploding with laughter\r\nover his own witticisms. It was generally at some “art patron” that he\r\nloved to gird—the owner of the famous blue room being a favourite victim.\r\n\r\nThere was one batch of correspondence, however, which was never made\r\npublic—with eating appetite had come, and in these letters Whistler\r\nhad fed himself to bursting-point. The law of libel stopped even his\r\nmouth, and only a very small number of friends was allowed to listen to\r\nthose masterpieces of demoniacal satire. It was an unfortunate thing\r\nfor art that during his life-time—except so far as his etchings were\r\nconcerned—Whistler’s genius was not recognized. The result was that many\r\nof his finest paintings were destroyed. His financial difficulties were\r\nno secret.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I went to see him and found him boiling over with anger\r\nsurrounded by masterpieces which he had just cut to ribbons in a storm\r\nof mad fury lest they should fall into the hands of the bailiffs; and\r\nall for a miserable debt of thirty pounds, which, for the moment, he was\r\nunable to pay. There they lay in strips—portraits, nocturnes, harmonies,\r\nsymphonies, gems which now, after a lapse of from thirty to forty years,\r\nwould be worth many thousand pounds. Any one of his friends would have\r\nlent him the money over and over again, but he was as proud as Lucifer,\r\nthe devil entered his soul, and the art tragedy was consummated. The blow\r\nhit me cruelly, for he had just finished a beautiful portrait of my wife;\r\nwhat it must have meant for Whistler himself nobody ever knew; but when\r\nhe cooled down among the ruins it must have been misery, for he was as\r\nconfident as Thucydides himself of the value of his own work. But how\r\nlucky it was that neither the Mother nor the Carlyle were included in\r\nthat massacre of the innocents—surely two of the most reverent portraits\r\nthat genius ever produced.\r\n\r\nWhistler’s hospitality was great—his Sunday luncheons (breakfasts he\r\ncalled them) were perfect; he had an excellent cook, who, with her\r\nhusband, made up the household, and there were constant little surprise\r\ndishes over which he would chuckle and linger till late in the afternoon;\r\nas Amphitryon, he was the embodiment of human happiness—sitting at\r\nthe head of his table dispensing quaint cates and still quainter\r\nsayings—barbed arrows sometimes—he was a sight for gods and men; the\r\ntalk was always good, for he had the knack of surrounding himself with\r\nall manner of clever people—but, as was once told of Kinglake, no matter\r\nhow many good things might be said, his were sure to be the best. The\r\nlightning flashes of his wit—his epigrams—were matchless. They were like\r\nthe sting in the tail of his emblematic butterfly, an insect unknown to\r\nmere vulgar entomologists.\r\n\r\nI once or twice met Oscar Wilde there, and a set-to between that big\r\nfat man and the little gnome-like Whistler was certainly good to listen\r\nto—but the lightweight always carried off the belt. Charles Keene, whose\r\nblack and white sketches for _Punch_ were Whistler’s admiration, was a\r\nfrequent guest. He was a tall, solemn-looking Don Quixote who used to\r\nwander through the suburbs dressed as a _rapin_ should be in a loose\r\njacket and slouch hat, with a black cutty pipe always in his mouth, and a\r\nsatchel hanging from his shoulders. He had a dry, racy humour of his own,\r\nwhich worked in well with the salad of wit at the table.\r\n\r\nOne day the conversation turned on health and nostrums; “Well,” said Don\r\nQuixote, “I think that if a man is ill there is only one thing for him\r\nto do; he must give up smoking for a fortnight.” “Yes! but supposing\r\nhe don’t smoke?” asked I. “Then I don’t know what he is to do.” Having\r\nuttered these words with pious gravity Charles Keene retired behind his\r\npipe and once more became a listener.\r\n\r\nThere was another very agreeable scoundrel, the sort of man who has done\r\neverything and been everywhere, a capital foil to the others. But one\r\nfine day he disappeared. Whistler had found him out. There are not a\r\nfew men of that sort who contrive to make a living in some way out of\r\nart and artists. But they seldom last long. I shall never forget that\r\nman’s account of the recovery of Rossetti’s poems. When his wife died\r\nthe great artist in his misery had laid the MS. in her coffin as a last\r\nloving gift—they were hers, he said, and she should keep them. Always\r\nbeing urged to regain them, he in the end yielded. The needful authority\r\nwas obtained, and in the dead of night Rossetti with a friend went to the\r\ncemetery. The coffin was exhumed and opened, the lovely hair which his\r\npaintings had made famous rippled out in waves. The MS. all stained with\r\nthe horrors of death, lying on her bosom, was reverently secured and the\r\ncoffin fastened down again. A weird story, but the poems were saved.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when, to my great regret, Whistler made up his mind to\r\nleave the old house in which he had lived for eleven years and to build\r\nthe “White House” in Tite Street, mainly prompted, as he told me, by\r\nthe wish to show what he could achieve in decoration. E. W. Godwin was\r\nthe architect and it was not long before they quarrelled over the work,\r\nin commemoration of which Whistler caused a stone to be inserted in the\r\nfront of the house, engraved with the words, “Except the Lord build the\r\nhouse, they labour in vain that build it—E. W. Godwin F.S.A. built this\r\nhouse.” The stone has long since disappeared. Godwin died in 1886 and in\r\n1888 Whistler married his widow. A quaint ending to an artistic feud.\r\n\r\nUnlike the great plagiarist Oscar Wilde, Whistler was always original.\r\nHe was himself, he imitated nobody. The other man, brilliantly clever\r\nas he undoubtedly was, never hesitated to copy. Both were startling and\r\naudacious in their dress; but Whistler in his long coat, playing with a\r\nslender Wanghai cane as tall as himself, his little white plume standing\r\nup in the midst of his black, or blackened, hair, was unlike anything or\r\nanybody else. He was delicate, playful, whimsical, a creature of fancy.\r\n\r\nWilde, the last time I saw him, was got up like a low-comedy caricature\r\nof a Tom and Jerry “Corinthian.” That day he was minded to be Georgian,\r\nand was swaggering in the King’s Road dressed in a brown frogged coat,\r\ntrimmed with cheap fur; on his head was an extravagant hat with a brim as\r\nmuch curled as the roof of a Chinese pagoda; the size and flatness of his\r\nhuge splay feet were accentuated by being forced out of a pair of tight\r\ntrousers carefully strapped over a pair of aggressively varnished boots;\r\nWhistler might be vain, but it was the vanity of Puck. The other man was\r\nCaliban.\r\n\r\nWhen Whistler made his famous answer, “Why drag in Velasquez?” he was in\r\nhis sly way laughing at himself, just as he was full of malicious fun\r\nwhen on somebody praising Leighton’s versatility as musician, linguist,\r\norator and what not, he said, “Paints a little too sometimes, don’t he?”\r\nHow came so bright an elf, so gay, so mischievous, into the world? He\r\nmust have been a changeling brought by some wanton sprite straight from\r\nthe realm of King Oberon.\r\n\r\nLindsey Row, with all its traditions, soon became absorbed into Cheyne\r\nWalk, and the very name would have been forgotten and lost had I not had\r\nthe audacity to call my two-fifths of the old building Lindsey House.\r\n\r\nA little further to the east, past the quaint old church so full of\r\nancient monuments and thoughts that were sermons in themselves, was the\r\nhome of Thomas Carlyle. He and his wife had been friends of my family\r\nand of my wife’s for many years, and when I went to live in Chelsea he\r\nsent to bid me go and see him. Having known him from childhood I was not\r\nafraid of him as most people were, though of Mrs. Carlyle I used to stand\r\nin considerable awe; but she had now been dead eight years, and the old\r\nwise man was always kind and gentle to me. So I often used to go and see\r\nhim on Sunday afternoon when he sat in his dressing-gown in the little\r\nroom at the back, smoking his long churchwarden, and he even allowed me\r\nto light a cigar—a rare privilege, I was told—for, as a rule, in that\r\nsanctum nobody might smoke but himself.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would put away his pipe, don his long brown coat and\r\nsoft wide-awake hat, grasp his cudgel and come out for a walk on the\r\nEmbankment or in Battersea Park. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, a great\r\nfriend of Carlyle’s and afterwards his executor, was a pretty frequent\r\ncompanion on these Sunday walks. During these outings Carlyle used to\r\ncross-examine me about Japan, which greatly excited his curiosity. He\r\nmade me very proud once by saying that he had “read my ‘Tales of Old\r\nJapan’ from Alpha to Omega.” He did not like the stories; there was too\r\nmuch blood and murder in them—but that was not my fault—at any rate, I\r\nfelt that to have been read “from Alpha to Omega” by Carlyle was a bright\r\nfeather in my cap. Occasionally, if the weather was bad, Carlyle would go\r\nfor what he called his drive. This meant taking the omnibus in the King’s\r\nRoad as far as the Bank and coming back in a return bus. I only once bore\r\nhim company on one of these expeditions, but it was a memorable occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was at the time of the Bulgarian atrocities when Mr. Gladstone was\r\ngoading the country into fury with his eloquence, till Delane once said\r\nto me, “Upon my word I verily believe that Gladstone thinks that Dizzy\r\nhimself had a hand in those outrages upon women and children.” Carlyle\r\nwas as hot upon the subject as Gladstone himself. When we got into the\r\nomnibus the old man began lashing out. “Hoo! Sir!” he said, “there’s\r\nthat Disraeli or Beaconsfield, or whatever he chooses to call himself;\r\nhe thinks himself the wisest man on earth, and he’s just the foolishest\r\nthing that crawls upon the face of it”—and so he went off at score,\r\nrattling out the most fantastic invective against the Tory Government\r\nand “the unspeakable Turk”; accusations to make one’s hair stand on end,\r\nfor he was as great an artist in adjectives as Dizzy himself—witness the\r\n“sea-green incorruptible” and the “French Revolution” _passim_—and when\r\nhe had spent himself in his indignation, real or feigned, then would\r\ncome a loud guffaw of laughter as much as to say, “See what a sad dog I\r\nam!” There were a few people in the omnibus who listened in open-mouthed\r\namazement—but the conductors all knew him, and were used to his wonderful\r\nways.\r\n\r\nI call attention to those bursts of laughter. They were very\r\ncharacteristic and very significant. Those who from Froude downwards have\r\nrecorded much of Carlyle’s conversation have given the impression of an\r\nill-natured, discontented man carping with no little spite at the rest of\r\nmankind. That was not Carlyle. That he held violent opinions expressed in\r\nviolent language is a fact. But much of his so-called cynicism was, I am\r\nconvinced, misunderstood.\r\n\r\nWhere he suspected fraud of any kind he was pitiless—but half his\r\nutterances were redeemed by a loud laugh, a laugh which impressed me as\r\nbeing quite as much directed against himself as against his victim—and\r\nthat laugh took the sting of cruelty out of his speech. He did not suffer\r\nfools gladly, and he could not brook being lionized, but during all\r\nthe years that I knew him—from before the year 1850 to the time of his\r\ndeath—he was always kind to everybody with whom I saw him—kind and, in\r\nhis rough way, considerate.\r\n\r\nThe downright nature of the man was well shown by what he said of the\r\nDuke of Wellington’s speeches in the House of Lords: “He was no orator,\r\nbut he was the best man there, for he had something to say and he said\r\nit.” To the gewgaws and tinsel of oratory he paid no respect; so the\r\ncloth were good he cared not for the embroidery. His great admiration of\r\nthe old warrior was fully shared by Mrs. Carlyle. Is it not recorded in\r\none of her letters or writings that on one occasion, happening to meet\r\nthe Duke at some party, she contrived to brush up against him in order\r\njust to be able to say that she had once touched him?\r\n\r\nLike everybody else who held Carlyle in reverent affection I was shocked\r\nby Froude’s publications. No falser portrait of a great man was ever\r\nhanded down to posterity than that which he has painted. Would Carlyle’s\r\nfriends have loved him as they did had he been the snarling, spiteful,\r\ninhuman monster that he represents, without one scintilla of the rare\r\ngeniality and of the power of friendship which he possessed?\r\n\r\nThat he was a good hater—such a hater as Dr. Johnson would have loved—no\r\nman will deny; much of his hatred was political; in regard to social\r\nlife—the life of man with his kind—I have known him to melt into a\r\ntenderness that was all the more touching coming as it did from the\r\nrugged Scottish peasant nature. I have walked with him and sat with him\r\nby the hour, without hearing him say an ill-natured word of man or woman.\r\n\r\nAbove all it is a pity that the veil of sanctity which should mask the\r\nwedded life of even the humblest individual should have been lifted in\r\nthe case of two such remarkable personalities as the Carlyles. Froude has\r\ndone it, greatly to the prejudice of the friend who trusted him, but who\r\nwas careful to express the feeling that the papers which he confided to\r\nhim would need judicious editing, and that at a time when the one person\r\nfitted to edit them would be no more. In spite of my great admiration for\r\nFroude as a writer of English prose, I am bound to say that his treatment\r\nof Carlyle must always remain a blot upon his reputation not only as a\r\nman of letters but as a friend.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the Carlyles were an ill-assorted couple. She\r\nconsidered from the beginning that to marry him was an act of\r\ncondescension on her part. The daughter of a country doctor at Haddington\r\nhad descended from the skies like Diana to Endymion to marry the son of\r\na stone-mason! I feel inclined to say “Poor Endymion!” But he loved her\r\nand was happy in his love. Not so she! Jealous of him she was—furiously\r\njealous—not as a lover, for there she knew she was safe. But she could\r\nnot bear to think that if she was famous it was as his wife, whereas she,\r\nknowing herself to be brilliant, would fain have had him to be known as\r\nthe husband of that wonderful Mrs. Carlyle. It was his success, social\r\nand literary, that she resented; it irked her to be in the second place,\r\nand she could not forgive it.\r\n\r\nThat she entertained any sentimental feeling about Carlyle’s intimacy\r\nwith Lady Ashburton is an absurd supposition hardly worthy of\r\ncontradiction. Harriet Lady Ashburton was an ideal _grande dame_,\r\naccomplished, well read, with a strong spice of Irish wit inherited from\r\nher mother Lady Sandwich, who was a Corry, a daughter of Lord Belmore;\r\nI knew her from my childhood up, indeed it was at the Grange that my\r\nfather and aunt made the acquaintance of the Carlyles, who met there\r\na whole galaxy of famous people, Thackeray, Charles Buller, Fleming,\r\nMonckton Milnes, Dickie Doyle, Titania’s favourite painter, and a host\r\nof others, all of whom were like the Ashburtons, hearty admirers of\r\nCarlyle’s genius. Mrs. Carlyle was always welcome either at the Grange or\r\nat Addiscombe, but he was the sun, she the moon—the satellite.\r\n\r\nThere was something else of which the lady was jealous, and that was the\r\nagony of concentration which her husband’s work meant for him. At moments\r\nher _sæva indignatio_ against “that Carlyle,” as she would somewhat\r\ncontemptuously call him, passed all bounds.\r\n\r\nOne day my aunt went to call upon her and found her in one of her\r\ntantrums—what was the matter, she asked: “Oh! my dear, it’s just that\r\nCarlyle! Would you believe it, I have had a headache for three days, and\r\nhe’s only just found it out. ‘I’m afraid you’re not quite well, my dear,’\r\nhe said—and all the time he has been working, working! I just threw a\r\ntea-cup at his head.” Petruchio had a bad time of it that day.\r\n\r\nAnother time “that” Carlyle was in great disgrace and Mrs. Carlyle in\r\ntears because the poor man had resented the presence of a dead mouse\r\nembalmed in his porridge at breakfast.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Carlyle was much to be pitied, not for any wrong that he did\r\nher, but because she was one of those people who make themselves wretched\r\nand pass on their misery to those near them. My aunt was one of those\r\nsympathetic people to whom others carry their troubles, and Mrs. Carlyle\r\nspared her not a moan. Carlyle’s self-reproaches after her death were a\r\ndelusion, born of her own shrewish complaints, which in his sorrow he\r\nschooled himself into believing to be well founded. That she was not\r\nan easy woman to live with is shown by the fact that she had been just\r\nas cantankerous with her mother at home as she was afterwards with her\r\nhusband. Her letters to him are the witnesses of that.\r\n\r\nIn society Mrs. Carlyle certainly shone. Her conversation was bright,\r\nwitty and stimulating, but when she went home to the privacy of her\r\njournal, thanks to Froude’s indiscretion, we see another woman. She was\r\nready enough to accept favours and hospitality from great people; then\r\nshe would hie back to Cheyne Row and write down little petty unkindnesses\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nTo a house where she had been received with much cordiality she was\r\ninvited with other friends to go and see the bridal trousseau of one of\r\nthe daughters; out comes the journal, and with fluent pen she gives her\r\nfriends full measure of spiteful satire because the linen is marked with\r\na coronet. Perhaps she would have found equal fault had the coronet been\r\nomitted. She was in her inmost heart a discontented woman in whom the\r\nmilk of human kindness had been turned sour by praise that was not always\r\ndestined for her alone, and she had been much encouraged by her friend\r\nMiss Jewsbury, the novelist, a very clever woman whom I sometimes met and\r\ndid not like.\r\n\r\nMuch is said in Froude’s volumes about Mrs. Carlyle’s beauty. When I knew\r\nher she was an elderly, even an old woman, but I could see no trace of\r\ngood looks—and people who had known her when she was young laughed at\r\nthe idea. However, love is blind, and in Carlyle’s eyes she was all that\r\nis beautiful. If it be true that in her youth she had so many suitors,\r\nit must have been her wit, and perhaps the _beauté du diable_, that\r\nattracted them.\r\n\r\nWhen the end came in 1881 and the lovable wise old man died full of\r\nhonour, Chelsea, and yet not Chelsea alone, mourned his loss. It was sad\r\nto think that we should never again see the lonely, pathetic figure in\r\nhis long brown coat and soft hat slouching along swiftly, stick in hand,\r\nwith his peculiar shuffling gait. His face was a picture of hale old\r\nage with its ruddy cheeks streaked like a russet apple, and his strong\r\nwhite hair and crisp beard. It was a figure that might have stepped out\r\nof a painting by Raeburn, a thing of the past with a nobility which was\r\nall its own—the sturdy, rugged independence of the northern peasant.\r\nEverybody in the Village of Palaces knew him, and everybody was proud of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmong the notables in Chelsea at that time was old William Bell Scott,\r\npoet and painter—not one of the giants in either capacity, but yet a\r\nman of some merit, for after all, to have achieved the honour of being\r\na crony of such men as Rossetti and Swinburne—who wrote a sonnet on his\r\ndeath—means something. He was a delightful, kindly old gentleman, who was\r\nalways welcome in a society the entrance to which was difficult indeed.\r\n\r\nRossetti, who had a way of chastening his friends, chaffed him in one of\r\nthose sets of nonsense verses in which he delighted.\r\n\r\n    There is an old person called Scott\r\n    Who thinks he can paint and can NOT.\r\n    Shall I call him a poet?\r\n    Oh! not if I know it!\r\n    This curious person called Scott.\r\n\r\nRossetti himself lived at Tudor House further east, a remnant, as it is\r\nsaid, of the old house where Catherine Parr was visited by the Lord High\r\nAdmiral Seymour before their marriage was made public; for some time\r\nGeorge Meredith and Swinburne shared the house with him. It is a matter\r\nof regret to me that I never knew Rossetti. He was much interested in\r\nJapan and in Japanese art, and when I published my “Tales of Old Japan”\r\nin 1871 he took a fancy to the book, and it was arranged that I should go\r\nand see him with Lord Wharncliffe, who was a friend of his; but for one\r\nreason or another the visit never came off, and when I went to live near\r\nhim chloral had done its work, and his health was no longer such as to\r\nenable him to make new acquaintances.\r\n\r\nWhistler’s excellently told stories of his wild eccentricities were\r\namazing. The tale of the pet bull kept in the little back garden and\r\nthe alarming vagaries of the beast and its master was inimitable; but\r\nfunniest of all was that of the five-barred gate. It seems that Rossetti\r\nwalking in some by-street saw a little model of a five-barred gate fixed\r\nin the window of a humble dwelling. This for some reason caught his\r\nfancy, and he was fired with the desire to have all the windows of his\r\nhouse decorated with miniature five-barred gates. With him to have a wish\r\nwas to gratify it. In a few days the windows were fitted with their new\r\nornament, and Rossetti was enchanted. Life was now worth living. After a\r\nday or two the house began to be besieged by carts bringing baskets of\r\ndirty linen. The poet was at his wits’ end and gradually became furious.\r\nWas he a laundryman? At last the mystery was revealed. The five-barred\r\ngates were in the poorer suburban localities a washerwoman’s sign,\r\nmeaning, “Washing is taken in here and linen carefully attended to.”\r\n\r\nThose were the palmy days of the Monday Popular Concerts. They were a\r\ngreat weekly pleasure. Every Monday evening my wife and I found ourselves\r\namong the crowd of real lovers of music listening to the masterpieces\r\nof the great composers, given out by such artists as Joachim, Madame\r\nNorman Neruda, Piatti, Lazarus, Hallé, Clara Schumann. The audiences were\r\nalways the same and in the same groups; there were even familiar figures\r\namongst the unreserved shilling seats that regularly occupied their own\r\nparticular places—did they come hours beforehand to secure them or was\r\nthere some such law of courtesy as governs the reservation of certain\r\nseats in the House of Commons?\r\n\r\nClose to us sat Mrs. Sartoris, Leighton and Robert Browning and scores\r\nof other devotees of lesser note. It was the perfection of Chamber\r\nMusic, but it was even better heard at those delightful concerts which\r\nSir Frederic Leighton used to give in his studio in Holland Park. There\r\nwe had the same artists and met the pick of their admirers; but the\r\nspace was just what the music was suited to, and not the most delicate\r\nshade, not the tenderest phrasing was lost, as it sometimes was in the\r\nhuge concert hall. And then Leighton himself was such an admirable\r\nhost, so instinct with that finest of all courtesy which springs from\r\nkindliness of heart and the honest delight in giving pleasure. I first\r\nmade Leighton’s acquaintance in 1855, the year in which the picture which\r\nmade him famous, the procession of Cimabue’s Madonna, was exhibited. He\r\nwas then a young man of twenty-five—handsome, accomplished, a musician,\r\nspeaking French, German and Italian in great perfection, with what\r\nprobably was a unique mastery of the different Italian patois from\r\nVenetian to Neapolitan.\r\n\r\nOne great charm that he possessed and retained to the end, save only\r\nunder the paroxysms by which his heart was being tortured, was the look\r\nof happiness—a rare gift; whether he were painting a picture, listening\r\nto music, or presiding in his royal way, lounging in the great armchair\r\nat an Academy dinner, he seemed to radiate happiness. To his friends he\r\nalways gave a glad and genial welcome, to young artists a helpful hand\r\nand sound advice. His charity was boundless, and it may rightly be said\r\nof him that he obeyed the precept of the sermon on the mount, “When thou\r\ndoest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.”\r\n\r\nThere was one side of Leighton’s character which perhaps few people\r\nsuspected. Underneath the soft, willowy, rather effeminate manner which\r\nhe affected in general society there lay a foundation of chivalry worthy\r\nof a Bayard. For his beloved Academy, as its chosen champion, he was\r\nready to do battle in the most literal sense of the word. The removal of\r\nthe Duke of Wellington’s statue from the top of Decimus Burton’s arch at\r\nHyde Park Corner, to which I shall refer later, led to a debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons, when Sir Robert Peel the Second took the opportunity\r\nto deliver an attack on the Royal Academy whose members he declared to\r\nbe “people of no very good taste.” He then singled out the President as\r\na target to be shot at in the most vicious manner, quoting Leighton’s\r\nevidence in the famous case of Belt v. Lawes, and arguing therefrom that\r\nthe Royal Academy “was not worthy of consideration in this House;” and he\r\nwound up with a rather risky pun, not in the best of taste, which, roared\r\nout with a voice which was perhaps the finest—certainly the loudest—that\r\never electrified the House, convulsed the faithful Commons with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Leighton came to my office in a fury—his rage at white\r\nheat. The affront to himself was nothing, but the Academy had been\r\ninsulted and as President he must take up the glove, and he was there to\r\nconsult me as to the propriety of calling out Sir Robert, at the same\r\ntime suggesting that I, as an old friend and largely concerned in the\r\nHyde Park Corner scheme, should be the bearer of the message.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in calming him, arguing that after all abuse of the kind was\r\nnothing more than a wasteful expenditure of carbonic acid gas, which\r\naccording to the law of the diffusion of gases would be absorbed and\r\nforgotten—nobody being the worse. Nothing came of it, and Leighton went\r\naway only half convinced; the argument that duelling was out of fashion\r\ncarried no weight with it; on that morning he was full of fight and as\r\neager to go and buy a case of pistols as any fire-eating Sir Lucius\r\nO’Trigger of the eighteenth century. I did not tell this to Sir Robert\r\nPeel, who was a friend of mine, and he died unaware of the terrors from\r\nwhich I had saved him.\r\n\r\nThe honours list of New Year’s Day, 1896, contained Leighton’s name as\r\na peer. His patent was signed on the 24th of January and on the 25th he\r\ndied, having been a peer for one day, without taking his seat in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and without signing the roll. His funeral at St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral was attended by all sorts and conditions of men from the great\r\nLord Salisbury downwards. A notable feature in the service was the\r\nchorale of trombones which was written by Beethoven for his own funeral\r\nand had never been heard since. The pealing of that solemn dirge, the\r\ngreat sound-waves rolling through the aisles, was soul-stirring. A nobler\r\nrequiem could not have been chosen.\r\n\r\nLeighton did not marry. With his good looks, which had something that\r\nbelonged to an archaic type, his varied talents and the success which\r\nalways appeals to women, he might have been irresistible, yet no one ever\r\nsaw him pay more attention to any woman, however beautiful, than was\r\njustified by the most chivalrous courtesy. He was in love, but it was\r\nwith his Art—she was his mistress and to her he was faithful to the end.\r\n\r\nIn these days when rough sketches and mere hints are extolled as works\r\nof genius it is the fashion to decry Leighton’s work. The new men shirk\r\nall that makes the painting of a picture difficult. Leighton boldly faced\r\nall the great obstacles that stand in the way of the man who would fain\r\nbe the exponent of the highest art. Sometimes—indeed, often—he failed.\r\nHis flesh tints were apt to be waxy and his drawing in parts weak, though\r\nno man ever painted flowing drapery more beautifully. Still, there are\r\npaintings of his which will live. To name only two, the Daphnephoria\r\nseems to me to be a most nobly imagined picture, full of dignity,\r\nmovement and life, and the portrait of Richard Burton in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery is not only a speaking likeness but a masculine and\r\nvigorous work. Those are not the only ones. But whatever he did showed\r\ndistinction and grace and a loftiness of aim of which he never lost sight.\r\n\r\nWhen Leighton was elected to the Dilettante Club, of which I was then\r\na member, he whimsically enrolled himself as their sculptor, “with\r\npermission occasionally to relapse into painting.” This was a playful\r\nallusion to the fine piece of classical sculpture which he had produced\r\nin 1877—the “Athlete wrestling with a Python” in the Tate Gallery—of the\r\nfirst sketch of which he gave me a replica.\r\n\r\nA constant guest at Leighton’s parties was Robert Browning who, unlike\r\nnot a few poets—Swinburne and Tennyson to wit, who had not the gift of\r\ntune—was a fanatic lover of music and never failed to seek it where\r\nit was at its best. So it happened that we often met him, and once he\r\nhonoured us by dining with us.\r\n\r\nHe was very pleasant and agreeable, handsome in a rather leonine way,\r\nbut his conversation lost some of its charm owing to his rasping, grating\r\nvoice. I once heard him read one of his poems, “The Ride to Ghent,” at\r\nthe house of Lady Stanley of Alderley. There were only about a dozen\r\npeople present; it was not a pleasing performance; the effect of the\r\npoetry was marred by that hoarse croak, like that of Edgar Allan Poe’s\r\nraven, and though he read with intense emotion he failed to touch. Had he\r\npossessed the attraction of a musical speaking voice he would have been\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between Leighton and Joachim was close and real, and no\r\nwonder; the two personalities so artistic, so refined, were eminently\r\nsuited to one another. Both were above all, quite apart from their art,\r\ncharming companions. They were of about the same age; Joachim, who\r\nsurvived Leighton by nine years, was one year younger. At dinner at our\r\nhouse one day Joachim told us how it was that he became an artist. When\r\nhe was a tiny boy of about four years his father, who lived at Kittsee\r\nnear Pressburg, went one day into the town to attend a fair and brought\r\nhome as a fairing for the child a little sixpenny toy fiddle. Little\r\nJoseph seized upon it eagerly, it became his constant companion, he\r\ncontrived to coax a tune out of it, and his destiny was fixed.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that as an exponent of the highest masterpieces\r\nof classical music he was the greatest violinist that ever lived. There\r\nhave been other artists full of technical accomplishments, fired by the\r\nmost intense musical passion—but for the power of throwing himself, as\r\nit were, into the very inmost soul of the great masters and reverently\r\nrealizing their intentions he never had an equal. That he had all the\r\nfire of his rivals, all their passion, he could show upon occasion, as,\r\nfor instance, in his wild, corybantic rendering of the Hungarian dances\r\nwhich he and Brahms adapted; but when he was dealing with the more\r\nserious school of music he proved that he had something more. There,\r\ntender and true as a lover should be, he exercised the most supreme\r\nself-effacement, and became the very voice of the tone poet at whose\r\nshrine he was at the time officiating as high priest. So great was his\r\nsympathy for his composer that when he played it was not Joachim who was\r\nspeaking to you but Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most amiable of men, and would often carry his violin\r\nwith him to the house of a friend, never weary of giving pleasure.\r\nIn that he was unlike some artists who resent, as I must say I think\r\nthey are justified in doing, any attempt at making use of them. Arthur\r\nSullivan once told me how at an evening party the hostess went up to him\r\nand said: “Oh! Sir Arthur, it would be so sweet of you if you would play\r\nus something.” The answer was characteristic. “My dear lady, there is\r\nJohn Millais. If he will sit down and make a sketch for you, I will play.\r\nHe has been painting all day, I have been working at music all day, so we\r\nare both in the same boat.”\r\n\r\nThe highly-strung nature of artists is accountable for many\r\nmisunderstandings, few more unintelligible than that which arose between\r\nthe large-hearted Joachim and Brahms, the friend whom he admired and\r\nto whose fame he did so much to contribute. It all arose out of the\r\nperformance or non-performance of a work of Brahms in 1873. It was a\r\ntrifling matter which might probably have been set right with ease. It\r\nmust have embittered the long years of life which remained to both, each\r\nconscious of the worth of the other. Brahms died in 1897; Joachim ten\r\nyears later. The separation from his wife, whom he adored, and the loss\r\nof his friend, were cruel blows. There are other men besides Job who\r\nmight well say, “I have lived too long!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n1874\r\n\r\nLORD BEACONSFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield was always singularly kind to me. One evening, soon\r\nafter I went into the Foreign Office, I sat next to Mrs. Disraeli at a\r\ndinner at the house of Lord Combermere, the old Peninsular hero. All of a\r\nsudden she turned round to me and said, “Dizzy has got his eye upon you.”\r\nAnd so it proved to be, for many years after, when the kind old lady\r\nwhom Queen Victoria created Viscountess Beaconsfield was dead, he, still\r\nMr. Disraeli, gave me the first important appointment which fell to his\r\ngift as Prime Minister in 1874. He was then seventy years of age, but he\r\nlooked older in spite of his carefully dyed and curled hair and a certain\r\ndandiness of dress, a relic of the D’Orsay days, which remained with him\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nI used sometimes to fancy that when he walked in the streets leaning\r\non the arm of his faithful “mastiff,” as he playfully called Lord\r\nAbergavenny, or Monty Corry, there was a slight purposeful exaggeration\r\nof the old-man stoop; certainly when he stood upright to make a speech,\r\nfired with excitement, there was no indication of any failing of\r\nstrength, though his eyes latterly lost their brilliancy. Those eyes\r\nwere the despair of Von Angeli when he painted his portrait for the\r\nQueen. “Das Auge ist tot,” he said. The _Vanity Fair_ picture of him in\r\nhis long, pale brown coat, walking with Monty Corry, handsome, smart,\r\ncarefully groomed, and obviously so proud of his charge, was admirable.\r\nCertainly no politician ever had a more devoted shadow than my dear old\r\nfriend Monty was to him. The affection between them was most touching.\r\nIndeed Disraeli’s was one of those natures which compel affection by\r\ntheir own generous power of giving it. He loved his friends and they\r\nloved him.\r\n\r\nOne man, whom he had made, betrayed him; I knew that man well and was\r\nacquainted with the whole story; but Disraeli had the magnanimity of\r\na noble character; no one ever heard him utter a word against the\r\nconfidential subordinate who had used him so ill. This may, perhaps,\r\nbe contrasted with the bitterness of his early attacks upon Peel. But\r\nat the time of which I am writing he was no longer a disappointed man\r\nstruggling, as the French say, to “arrive.” He had “arrived,” and in his\r\nproud position took no heed of the malice and venom of lesser men.\r\n\r\nHis conversation was always delightful; but nowhere did he shine more\r\nthan at the Sunday dinners of Baron Lionel de Rothschild. Those dinners\r\nwere indeed brilliant—Dizzy, Charles Villiers, the famous free-trade\r\nmember for Wolverhampton, and Bernal Osborne were almost always there;\r\nJohn Delane, the Jupiter of the _Times_, another frequent guest.[37]\r\nTo listen to those wonderful wits, talking not for the gallery, but\r\nthrowing the ball to and fro for their own pleasure, was something worth\r\nremembering. Those were conversational fireworks.\r\n\r\nThere were always one or two of the smartest and most beautiful women\r\npresent, and one or two young men—often Henry Calcraft and myself. Baron\r\nLionel himself was one of the wisest, kindest and noblest men that I ever\r\nknew, and the Baroness, who must have been so beautiful in her youth,\r\nwas as a matron the picture of grace and dignity. In a Jewish house\r\nDisraeli was always happy. He retained (witness “Coningsby”) the greatest\r\nadmiration for the people from whom it was his pride to have sprung. One\r\nday I went to call upon Baron Lionel in Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n“Your friend has just left me,” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“Whom do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, Dizzy, to be sure—he is your friend, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\nI asked at haphazard what they had been talking about.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the Baron, “as usual, the Race.”\r\n\r\nThe great fascination of Lord Beaconsfield’s talk lay in the grotesque\r\nturn which he could give to the most ordinary subjects. His epithets\r\nwere sometimes quite startling, even in his Parliamentary speeches. A\r\nfriend of mine (I cannot remember who it was) once put this to me very\r\nwittily and very sadly. The House of Commons had been sitting all night.\r\nI went down to the House—to which my office gave me access—and saw the\r\ngreen benches, not crowded, but occupied by a number of members looking\r\nhideously debauched and being addressed by an Irishman, wild, unkempt,\r\nunshorn. As I entered the lobby my friend came out. “This is a pretty\r\nstate of things,” he said, “and there is no one in authority. Hartington\r\nhas gone to Goodwood, Dizzy has gone to the Lords, and Gladstone is\r\nreading Homer at Hawarden! If only Dizzy had been here he would have\r\ncrushed these men with an adjective!” It was so true!\r\n\r\nOne amusing instance of Dizzy’s adjectival powers is worth recording. Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt had attacked him in one of his most telling speeches,\r\nwith which he had evidently shown great self-satisfaction, as, indeed,\r\nwas his right, though it was a little imprudent to do so, seeing with\r\nwhom he had to deal. When Sir William sat down Dizzy got up to reply, and\r\nin his quiet, imperturbable way chaffed the honourable member about his\r\n“Herodian oratory.” This puzzled all the newspapers, who made many futile\r\nguesses at what the Prime Minister had meant. At last one paper—I think\r\nit was the _Pall Mall Gazette_—said that the word which Mr. Disraeli had\r\nused was Rhodian, not Herodian, the orators of Rhodes being in old times\r\nfamous for their eloquence! The next day there was a luncheon party at\r\nSir Stafford Northcote’s in Downing Street, and the conversation turned\r\nupon the speech and the much-discussed adjective. Lady Northcote asked\r\nDizzy, who was present, what he really had said, and what he really had\r\nmeant. “My dear lady,” was the very solemn answer, “are we not told that\r\nHerod made an oration and that he gave not God the glory?” There was a\r\nroar of laughter, in which we all joined.\r\n\r\nThere was much sympathy between Sir William Harcourt and Disraeli.\r\nIndeed, so close was the affection which the two bore to one another\r\nthat there was a moment when people imagined that they might join hands\r\npolitically. But that could not be. Sir William, for all his blue blood,\r\nand his royal extraction, was too convinced a Radical to be able to\r\npalter with the Carlton Club. He was a delightful companion, witty,\r\naccomplished; it was a pleasure to the two heroes to fence socially,\r\nsharpening their blades when the buttons were on the foils; but\r\npolitically, when the buttons were off, the tierce and quart were furious\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nBetween Gladstone and Disraeli there was no love lost; the two rivals\r\nwere utterly opposite and cordially disliked one another. Disraeli\r\nalmost always spoke of Gladstone with a spice of contempt. Once he told\r\nus how the Emperor of Brazil had sent him and Mr. Gladstone the grand\r\ncordon of some order. “I wrote him a letter of warmest thanks which\r\ncould make the dear man believe that he had satisfied the one ambition\r\nof my life; Gladstone sent his star back, with an expression of regret\r\nthat his Sovereign did not permit him to accept foreign decorations.\r\nClumsy fellow! Could he not have put it away in a drawer, as I did?”\r\nI remember well the gusto with which he accentuated the words “Clumsy\r\nfellow!” The truth is that there was in Gladstone a lack of that\r\nman-of-the-worldliness which Dizzy admired so much in Lord Granville.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the Captaincy of Deal Castle belongs to the Lord Warden\r\nof the Cinque Ports. When Lord Clanwilliam died Lord Granville, who was\r\nLord Warden, appointed Lord Sydney in his place; at the same time, lest\r\nthere should be any misconception, Lord Granville, with that courtesy of\r\nwhich he was such a master, wrote and told Lord Beaconsfield what he had\r\ndone. The answer was short and characteristic:\r\n\r\n                               “Hughenden Manor, October 21st, 1879.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    “Happy Sydney to be your neighbour!\r\n\r\n                           “Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                     “BEACONSFIELD.”\r\n\r\nHis notes were always charming. When he was living in Whitehall he wrote\r\nto Count Pierre Schuvaloff, the Russian Ambassador, inviting him to\r\na little informal dinner, saying, “You will make six ladies happy and\r\nfive men jealous.” “Mon cher ami,” Schuvaloff said, when he showed me\r\nthe note, “elles étaient toutes grandmères!” He had, by the by, a very\r\nhigh opinion of Schuvaloff’s ability. When he came back from Berlin\r\nhe was talking to me one day about the Congress, and the different\r\nstatesmen and diplomatists who had taken part in it, with several of\r\nwhom I was acquainted. Prince Gortchakoff and Schuvaloff were the two\r\nRussian representatives, but Prince Gortchakoff was a very different man\r\nfrom the Gortchakoff whom I had known some fifteen years before at St.\r\nPetersburg. He had grown old and feeble, and, as Lord Beaconsfield put\r\nit, lachrymose. Schuvaloff had to fight his battle alone, and, said Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, “I was amazed at the way in which he held his own against\r\nus all.” With all his dandified, rather frivolous ways, Schuvaloff struck\r\nhim as a very strong foeman.\r\n\r\nThat Bismarck shared this view of Count Schuvaloff is evident from his\r\n“Gedanken und Erinnerungen.” Between Bismarck and Prince Gortchakoff\r\nthere had long been a sort of silent feud. Gortchakoff rather posed as\r\nif he had been something like a Mentor to Bismarck, who latterly grew to\r\nlook upon him with ill-disguised contempt. He laughed at his vanity, his\r\nboastfulness, and even at his readiness to accept a diplomatic snuffbox\r\nmounted in diamonds, provided that they were “de bonnes grosses pierres”\r\n(“Gedanken,” etc., Vol. II., p. 125). For Schuvaloff, on the contrary,\r\nBismarck had a great liking, and, indeed, the correspondence between the\r\ntwo statesmen bears witness to an exceptional degree of respect and even\r\naffection on both sides (II., 249-252).\r\n\r\nBismarck says in so many words that it was against the wish of the\r\nEmperor of Russia that Gortchakoff took part in the Congress of Berlin,\r\nand that although, as Chancellor of the Empire, he nominally had\r\nprecedence, it was Schuvaloff, officially his subordinate, who was\r\nthe real and only plenipotentiary for Russia, but Bismarck’s opinion\r\nof him, formed during his embassy at St. Petersburg, is evident from\r\nthe following passage in the “Gedanken.” “Peter Schuvaloff, the most\r\nfar-seeing brain with which I came into contact there, a man who only\r\nneeded industry to play a leading part” (Vol, II., p. 244).\r\n\r\nIt is disappointing to find Lord Beaconsfield hardly mentioned in\r\nBismarck’s reminiscences. He had found his match and there was, perhaps,\r\na slight unwillingness (great men are not always above small vanities),\r\nto allude to the man who, far more than himself, was master of the\r\nsituation during the Congress; but Berlin has not yet forgotten the\r\nhistoric words with which he summed up his impressions of that famous\r\nmeeting: “Der alte Jude ist der Mann”—“The old Jew is the man.” It was\r\na great, if involuntary, tribute! The ordering of the special train,\r\nwhich brought Bismarck post-haste to “the old Jew’s” quarters and forced\r\nEngland’s views upon the panic-stricken Congress, was a volcanic triumph\r\nsuch as has rarely, if ever, been equalled in diplomacy. That is how\r\npeace with honour was carried back to England, to be proclaimed to the\r\neager crowd from a window in Downing Street.\r\n\r\nThere was one amusing incident in connection with the Berlin Congress:\r\none day it was announced that on the morrow Lord Beaconsfield was to\r\naddress the assembled statesmen and that he would speak in French. Lord\r\nOdo Russell, who was a master of tongues, heard this with no little\r\nalarm, for it was well known that Lord Beaconsfield’s French was very\r\nmuch of the Stratford-atte-Bowe type. Lord Odo, always clever, went to\r\nhim and adroitly turned the conversation on to the next day’s conference.\r\nLord Beaconsfield announced his intention of speaking. “In what language\r\ndo you propose to speak?” asked Lord Odo. “In French,” was the answer. “I\r\nam afraid that will be a very great disappointment to the colleagues,”\r\nsaid Lord Odo. “You see, they know that they have here in you the\r\ngreatest living master of English oratory, and of course they are longing\r\nto hear you.” The great man smiled his pleasure, and the speech was\r\ndelivered in English. Lord Odo was wont to declare that he never knew\r\nwhether he took the hint or accepted the compliment.\r\n\r\nPoschinger, in his “Conversations with Prince Bismarck,” records the\r\nfollowing appreciation by the latter of Lord Beaconsfield during the\r\nBerlin Congress: “I frequently had him to spend the evening with us; as\r\nhe was unwell he only came on the condition of being alone, and I thus\r\nhad many an opportunity of getting to know him well. I must say that, in\r\nspite of his fantastic novel writing, he is a capable statesman, far\r\nabove Gortchakoff and many others. It was easy to transact business with\r\nhim; in a quarter of an hour you knew exactly how you stood with him;\r\nthe limits to which he was prepared to go were clearly defined, and a\r\nrapid summary soon precised matters. Beaconsfield speaks magnificent and\r\nmelodious English, and has a good voice; he spoke nothing but English\r\nat the Congress. The Crown Princess asked me about this time whether\r\nBeaconsfield did not speak French very beautifully. I answered that I\r\nhad not heard anything of it up till then. ‘But in the Congress?’ she\r\ninquired further. ‘He only speaks English,’ said I; ‘and here she dropped\r\nthe conversation,’ added the Chancellor in English, with a significant\r\ngesture of his hand.”[38]\r\n\r\nAs regards what Bismarck called his “fantastic novel writing,” there may\r\nbe a word to be said. Perhaps of all his writings the one to which the\r\nepithet “fantastic” might the most righteously be applied was “Lothair,”\r\nand yet even in that book, of which superficial readers spoke with\r\nsome contempt, persons of more penetrating philosophical and political\r\njudgment perceived depths which were unsuspected by the vulgar herd of\r\ncirculating-library subscribers. Lord Russell, for instance—no friend to\r\nthe author—expressed his amazement that people should fail to see what\r\ndeep significance underlay the gaudy trappings. In his view it was the\r\nbook of a political seer; and he was right. Did it not forewarn us of the\r\ndangers of the Commune? The fiction of the novel-writer was in his hands\r\na vehicle for impressing the truths of the politician as they appeared to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Born in a library,” as he said of himself, he had amassed a rich store\r\nof out-of-the-way book-lore, and would often puzzle the reporters with\r\nsome quotation that was quite new to them. I remember a speech to the\r\npoint (not that Horace could be called an out-of-the-way book), in which\r\nhe said that if anybody should disagree with him “naviget Anticyras.”[39]\r\nThis plunged the newspapers into the blackest of fogs. I met him the\r\nnext day and we laughed a good deal over their bewilderment and their\r\nstruggles to get out of the gloom. “Let this be a lesson to you, my dear\r\nboy, never to use a quotation with which the reporters are not familiar.”\r\n\r\nOne day when he was in the House of Lords he was attacked by the Duke\r\nof Argyll upon an Indian question, as to which he was only partially\r\ninstructed, and in his reply he made some hideous blunder which\r\nfortunately nobody detected. Monty Corry, who had been listening on\r\ntenterhooks, was waiting for him outside, and they walked away together,\r\nas usual. “How could you make such a mistake?” asked Monty, “it was\r\nuncommonly lucky that nobody found you out.” Lord Beaconsfield stopped\r\ndead short, reflected for a second or two, and then said gravely and\r\nsolemnly: “My dear Monty, God is great! And upon my word I think He grows\r\ngreater and greater every day!”\r\n\r\nI don’t think that he had much love for the Duke of Argyll. When Lord\r\nGrey de Wilton (I think it was) spoke upon the address to the Queen at\r\nan opening of Parliament he alluded to the Prime Minister as the “man at\r\nthe helm not to be spoken to.” The Duke presently got up and delivered\r\none of his slashing party speeches, in which his noble voice rang out\r\nlike a trumpet: “The noble lord has spoken of the man at the helm. My\r\nLords, there is _no_ man at the helm.” Lord Beaconsfield sat sphinx-like,\r\nimmovable, unreadable—but I do not think he liked it.\r\n\r\nWhen it was expected that he would make a great speech in the House of\r\nLords the red benches were crowded. I once was present at the bar of the\r\nHouse when an Indian question was raised by the Duke of Argyll in a very\r\npowerful oration. Dizzy got up and answered the Duke, saying that the\r\npapers would shortly be laid, and that he hoped the Duke would read them\r\n“with pleasure and profit.” That was all—there was no speech, and great\r\ndisappointment. That time I don’t think the Duke liked it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD BEACONSFIELD AND LORD ROWTON.\r\n\r\n_From the “Vanity Fair” cartoon by Leslie Ward (“Spy”), by permission of\r\nthe Editor._]\r\n\r\nOne evening—it must have been in 1880, or very early in 1881—I met Lord\r\nBeaconsfield at a dinner-party at Lady Airlie’s. He was in high good\r\nhumour, and when he had greeted the hostess came up to me and said, “We\r\nhave been having great fun in the House of Lords—a first-rate set-to\r\nbetween the Duke of Argyll and Lytton.” I asked who got the best of\r\nit. “Lytton! He gave the Duke two black eyes and a bloody nose.” Then\r\nMatthew Arnold came up, and he changed the subject. I wondered if he\r\nwas thinking of the day when he acted as bottleholder to James Clay[40]\r\nin his great fight with the skipper at Constantinople. He was very\r\nproud of “Bob” Lytton, the son of his old friend—the man whom he made\r\nGovernor-General of India—recognizing in him a certain Oriental colouring\r\nand poetic mysticism in which there was a kinship to his own genius.\r\n\r\nBiography has so far scarcely done justice to Lord Beaconsfield’s memory.\r\nMonypenny’s scholarly book is a wonderful example of the infinite\r\ncapacity for taking pains, but it altogether lacks that personal note\r\nwhich is so attractive in the best biographies—Boswell’s “Johnson,”\r\nTrevelyan’s “Macaulay,” Morley’s “Gladstone,” “The Life of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill,” are delightful, not only as history, but also and mainly\r\nbecause of the long, intimate and personal connection in each case\r\nbetween the writer and his subject.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say who could have given us a perfectly satisfactory\r\nlife of Disraeli, handing down to posterity a living picture of the man.\r\nLord Rowton had all the materials, but he suffered from acute laziness,\r\nand there is nothing to show that he had the gift of penmanship. Henry\r\nCalcraft, had he lived, might have done it. He knew Lord Beaconsfield as\r\nintimately as it would be possible for a younger man to know one so much\r\nhis elder. He was very much behind the scenes in politics, and he could\r\nwrite. I know no one else who could have had so much chance of success.\r\n\r\nMonypenny’s book is like a posthumous portrait painted from photographs\r\nin memory of a great man, by one who never knew him—it is wanting in\r\nthe life spark which only sittings could give. The study is excellent\r\nhistory, but how one longs for those deft touches which belong to what\r\nGoethe called “the world of the eye.” Mr. Buckle, on the other hand, in\r\nhis continuation has been more successful. He has contrived to breathe\r\nsoul into the cold marble statue of the first two volumes, and makes his\r\nreader regret that he did not undertake the work from the beginning.\r\n\r\nDisraeli’s veneration for his father, his love for his sister and\r\ncorrespondent, Sarah, the tender reverence and gratitude in which he\r\nembalmed the memory of his wife, his faithful, unswerving allegiance\r\nto his friends, dead and alive, all these are traits in his character,\r\nwhich could hardly be told with living force save by those who heard his\r\nfamiliar talk, and listened to the music of a far-off sorrow which would\r\nsometimes come into that noble voice. Happily he himself in his “Letters\r\nHome,” and indirectly in his novels, has told us much of all this.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when he was living in Downing Street, I went to see him. It\r\nhappened to be the Queen’s birthday, and after we had sat talking for a\r\nlittle while he made me give him my arm to walk across to the Foreign\r\nOffice and see the preparations for his official dinner. We stood looking\r\nat the table, the flowers and all the glittering furniture of a great\r\nstate banquet, when all of a sudden he turned round, his eyes were dim,\r\nand his voice husky, as he said: “Ah! my dear fellow, you are happy, you\r\nhave a wife.” He was thinking of that devoted lady who could literally\r\nendure torture for his sake, and whose help he sorely missed to the end\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nThe story of her heroic devotion on a memorable occasion is so old that\r\nit may be almost new. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer and was to make\r\na great speech. Mrs. Disraeli drove with him to the House, where she was\r\nto leave him. In shutting the carriage the footman jammed her hand in the\r\ndoor; the agony was excruciating, but she sat like grim death and uttered\r\nnever a word lest she should distract him at a moment when he needed all\r\nhis wits; when he left the carriage she fell back in a dead faint! All\r\nher thoughts, all her heart, were centred in her husband and his fame;\r\nhe knew it, and was deeply grateful. She was older than he was, but had\r\nbeen pretty, and as the widow of his colleague in the representation\r\nof Maidstone she brought him a comfortable little private gentleman’s\r\nfortune; but the expenses of public life were great, and I doubt whether,\r\neven in spite of the legacy which he received from Mrs. Brydges Williams,\r\nhe was ever financially quite at his ease.\r\n\r\nOf art for the sake of the beauty that is in it I do not think that he\r\nhad any very great appreciation—sculpture galleries, the glories of\r\nHolbein, Raphael, Van Dyck, Sir Joshua, Gainsborough and the great\r\nmasters seemed to appeal to him chiefly as the fitting appanage of\r\npowerful nobles and stately palaces. Just as Kant saw in pictures no\r\nmore than the vanity of the man who hung them up, so to Disraeli they\r\nwere sacred rather as representing pedigree and tradition than as the\r\ninspiration of genius in the artist and a source of æsthetic pleasure to\r\nthe possessor.\r\n\r\nOn music I have heard him descant with but slight discrimination; but\r\nsuccess always appealed to him, and so he would be moved by the fame\r\nof a great musician, or a great painter, whose art might perhaps fail\r\nto stir his pulses. If he was as callous in these matters as I imagine\r\nhim to have been, it is curious that the only time when I saw him show\r\nany excitement—for he was past master in the art of concealing what he\r\nfelt—should have been about a matter connected with art.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Grant died in 1878, and there was to be an election to the\r\nhonour of President of the Royal Academy. On the evening of the election\r\nmy wife and I dined at a very small party at Kensington Palace. I sat\r\nnext to Lord Beaconsfield. Before dinner was announced he asked me\r\nwhether I had heard anything as to the chances of the election. I told\r\nhim that I knew that Horsley was a rival candidate, but that he could not\r\nhave much prospect of beating Leighton. “Surely they will never be so\r\nfoolish as to elect anybody else. He is the very man for the place.” More\r\nthan once during dinner he returned eagerly to the subject, in which he\r\ntook no pains to hide his interest. “Ah! well!” I remember his saying at\r\nlast, looking at the clock, “it’s all over by now.”\r\n\r\nI have spoken of his familiarity with rather out-of-the-way books. Upon\r\none occasion we were talking of Schliemann’s discoveries at Troy and of\r\nLowe’s refusal, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, to purchase\r\nthe contents of King Priam’s treasure house—a decision which I greatly\r\nregretted. I mentioned that Lowe snuffed out the suggestion with a\r\nquotation: “Etiam periere ruinæ” was all that he said. “Ah!” said Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, “from Lucan’s ‘Pharsalia,’ a fine poem.” The quotation is\r\nof course well known, but as Lucan is not one of the authors whom the\r\nhead masters have taken under their wing, I much doubt whether there\r\nwere two men in the two Houses of Parliament who could have said offhand\r\nwhence it came, or have given an opinion as to the merits of the poem.\r\n\r\nDeeply read as he was, I never heard him talk of modern literature. The\r\nonly comparatively modern book that I knew him to praise was “Walpole’s\r\nLetters.” Of those he spoke with enthusiasm: “No man need be dull who\r\npossesses ‘Walpole’s Letters.’” Indeed, although he was himself a man of\r\nletters, and had the deepest veneration for his father as a literary man,\r\nhe had but little knowledge of the writers of his own day. Probably he\r\nwas too much absorbed by politics to care for the society of the literary\r\nbrotherhood. On one occasion he asked me whether there was any man whom\r\nhe could invite to his official dinner on the Queen’s birthday as the\r\nrepresentative of letters.\r\n\r\nHis answer to a fine lady who at one of the Foreign Office parties asked\r\nhim “whether he wanted a really good novel?” raised much laughter. “My\r\ndear, when I want a good novel I write it.”\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield as an actor was inimitable. He was a master of stage\r\neffect, and he never gave a better example of his histrionic powers\r\nthan when, in 1877, he was attacked upon his appointment of Mr. Pigott\r\nto the Controllership of the Stationery Office, which a committee of\r\nthe House of Commons had declared ought to be filled by a professional\r\nstationer and printer. Ignoring this for wise and practical reasons,\r\nwhen the office became vacant he appointed to the post, which was worth\r\n£1,500 a year, Mr. Pigott, a clerk in the War Office. The truffle dogs\r\nof the House of Commons scented a job, and yapped all the more fiercely\r\nwhen they found out that Mr. Pigott was the son of the former rector\r\nof Hughenden. The Conservative Whips somehow mismanaged the affair,\r\nand a vote of censure was passed in the lower House by a majority of\r\nfour votes. There was a great commotion in the country and the _Times_\r\ncondemned the appointment as “too splendidly audacious.”\r\n\r\nI went to the House of Lords to hear the great man’s answer to all this\r\nhubbub. Never shall I forget the air of dejection, the hangdog look,\r\nwith which he entered the House. His head was bent, his gait uncertain,\r\nand he sat down wearily beside the Duke of Richmond. When the clerk of\r\nthe Parliaments called upon him he rose slowly and proceeded to explain\r\nthe motives which had led him to the selection of Mr. Pigott. Then came\r\nthe personal note. “My Lords, it has been said in an assembly almost as\r\nclassical as that which I am addressing, that this appointment was a\r\njob—that the father of Mr. Pigott was the parson of my parish, that I\r\nhad relations of long and intimate friendship with him, that he busied\r\nhimself in county elections, and that in my earlier contests in the\r\ncounty with which I am connected I was indebted to his exertions. My\r\nLords, this is really a romance.”\r\n\r\nHere his face began to brighten. “Thirty years ago there was a vicar of\r\nmy parish of the name of Pigott, and he certainly was father to this\r\ngentleman. He did not owe his preferment to me, nor was he ever under\r\nany obligation to me. Shortly after I succeeded to the property Mr.\r\nPigott gave up his living and retired to a distant county. I have never\r\nhad any relations with him. With regard to our intimate friendship and\r\nhis electioneering assistance, all I know of his interference in county\r\nelections is”—here he drew himself up to his full height and looked round\r\nthe House with his hands in his favourite attitude, one on each hip with\r\nthe thumbs turned outwards—“is that before he departed from the County of\r\nBuckingham he registered his vote against me.” The effect was electric;\r\nthe House of Lords for once was galvanized into something like life, and\r\nas he sat down radiant and triumphant amid the cheers and laughter of the\r\ngood peers, I felt that I never had seen, and never again should see, so\r\nfine a piece of acting. The Lord Beaconsfield who walked out of the House\r\nthat evening with a firm step was twenty years younger than the poor old\r\nman, borne down with care, and the weight of years who had shuffled into\r\nit so feebly an hour earlier.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons apologized. Is this unique?\r\n\r\nIn June, 1879, London was stirred by the news of the death of the Prince\r\nImperial in the Zulu war. That afternoon Sir Coutts and Lady Lindsay had\r\ninvited a few people to see the pictures at the Grosvenor Gallery. As\r\nI was going away I met Lord Beaconsfield on the stairs. He stopped me.\r\n“This is terrible news,” he said. “Yes,” I answered, “and I am afraid\r\nthat the French will accuse our people of having deserted him and left\r\nhim to his fate.” “I am not so sure that they will be wrong,” he said,\r\nand then after a pause, he added, “Well! my conscience is clear. I did\r\nall that I could to stop his going. But what can you do when you have\r\nto deal with two obstinate women?” With that he went on up the stairs,\r\nleaving me under the impression that he wished what he had said to be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe Empress overpersuaded the Queen, and the Prince went out. It was\r\na wild-cat scheme, for he was sent out with no status in the army and\r\ntherefore with no object, but the Empress thought that being a Buonaparte\r\nfighting would give him and the dynasty prestige with his people—and so\r\nan important life which could not but have weighed in the history of\r\nEurope was sacrificed. He was a gallant lad, with good abilities, and a\r\ngreat favourite with his contemporaries at our military college of whom\r\nmy brother-in-law was one and a great friend of his. I only met him once,\r\nbut was much struck by his charm of manner.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of great men should be recorded, otherwise anything in the\r\nshape of a memoir, or even sketch, becomes what a German critic would\r\ncall a mere _Ja und Amen Buch_. Lord Beaconsfield’s weakness consisted in\r\noccasionally, perhaps unconsciously, borrowing a good saying or epigram\r\nwhich had struck his imagination and serving it up as his own. In the\r\nfamous case of his speech on the death of the Duke of Wellington he went\r\na step further and translated verbatim a speech or essay by Thiers on the\r\nqualities which go to make up a great Captain.\r\n\r\nOf course this was duly shown up[41] and was the subject of much ridicule\r\nat the time—but he lived it down as he did all his other mistakes;\r\nall men, great and small, make mistakes, but whereas the small men are\r\ndrowned, the great men rise up again; that is one true sign of greatness.\r\n\r\nAlmost his last speech, certainly his last great speech, was delivered\r\non March the 4th, 1881, upon the subject of the proposed evacuation of\r\nCandahar, against which he fought stoutly and eloquently. In that speech\r\nhe used these words which have been preserved as a classical utterance:\r\n“But, my Lords, the key of India is not Herat or Candahar. The key of\r\nIndia is London.”\r\n\r\nPrince Lobanoff was at that time Russian ambassador, and three years\r\nlater, when he was Chancellor of the Empire, we met at Contrexéville,\r\nand used to breakfast, drive out, and dine together every day. He\r\ntalked a great deal of his London days and of his admiration for Lord\r\nBeaconsfield. But he told me that the day before the delivery of the\r\nCandahar speech he called in Curzon Street and had a long talk with\r\nLord Beaconsfield on the Indian question—the Russian question, as it\r\nwas called in England at that time. Lord Beaconsfield said: “We cannot\r\nevacuate Candahar, for it is the key of India.” Prince Lobanoff answered:\r\n“No! London is the key of India.” “Le lendemain il a reproduit mon mot\r\ndans son fameux discours!”\r\n\r\nPrince Lobanoff, by the by, was a great wit and a very accomplished\r\nman. His collection of books, papers, pasquinades and MSS. concerning\r\nthe great French Revolution was unique. His sudden and tragic death\r\nat Schepetowka when travelling in the suite of the Tsar on the return\r\njourney from Vienna to Kiew on the 30th of August, 1896, meant a great\r\nloss not only to Russia, but to his foreign friends. For a Russian\r\nstatesman and diplomatist he was singularly outspoken. We were talking\r\nonce about Russian politics. In answer to an observation of mine as to\r\nthe personal power of the Tsar he remarked: “Yes! so long as he is in\r\naccord with the policy of his ministers. Lorsqu’un Empereur de Russie a\r\nvoulu s’opposer à la volonté de ses ministres, on a toujours trouvé moyen\r\nde s’en débarrasser.” I was amazed!\r\n\r\nSeldom has the month of March been more cruel, even in England, than it\r\nwas in 1881. The weather was bitter, and the blighting east wind seemed\r\nto reduce men’s skin to powder. About the middle of the month we heard\r\nthat Lord Beaconsfield was ailing. The old story, a slight chill. At\r\nfirst there was no anxiety, but when men were told after some days that\r\nhe was still in bed, they began to shake their heads. That sick bed in a\r\ndull Curzon Street house (No. 19) was watched by some half dozen faithful\r\nfriends, Rowton, Barrington and two or three others, who prayed, and\r\nprayed in vain, that the east wind might cease, for the doctors had said\r\nthat all depended upon a change from the west bringing a little warm\r\nmoisture into the air. It was hoping against hope; day after day the\r\nblasts, charged with all the filth of the great city, blew fiercely and\r\nyet more fiercely, bringing poison to those parched lungs. On the 19th of\r\nApril he died, choked by London.\r\n\r\nThe mourning was universal all over the country; never, except in the\r\ncase of King Edward’s death, have I seen so much feeling shown; he had\r\nwon his way into the hearts of the people, who knew that in him England\r\nhad lost not only a great statesman but a true lover. A mighty man had\r\nfallen. Even his political enemies admitted that he left a void which\r\ncould not be filled.\r\n\r\nThere was no public funeral—no gorgeous ceremony in Westminster Abbey\r\nor St. Paul’s Cathedral. He had willed it otherwise. He was buried as\r\nhe wished to be, by the side of his dearly loved wife, almost under the\r\nshadow of those trees which had been so much to him and which gave their\r\nname to the county[42] with which he was so long bound up. “You may tire\r\nof mountains and rivers, you may tire of the sea, but you can never tire\r\nof trees,” was a favourite saying of his. And so we laid him in his\r\ngrave, simply, reverently. There was none of the paid panoply of woe, but\r\ngreat grief and true mourning. Men of all ranks were there, colleagues\r\nand foes.\r\n\r\nAs I stood by the open grave I happened to be next to Sir William\r\nHarcourt. In all that concourse there was no sadder face than that of\r\nthe man who had been his enemy and his friend for so many years. No one\r\nmourned him more sincerely than the Queen, whose faithful servant he\r\nhad been, and who rewarded him with an affectionate gratitude which was\r\ncharacteristic of her. She visited his grave and laid upon it an offering\r\nof primroses, with the inscription in her own hand, “His favourite\r\nflower.” Alive she had loaded him with honours; when he was dead she paid\r\nthat last simple tribute of respect to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe “his” in the Queen’s inscription referred to the Prince Consort,\r\nwhose favourite flower the primrose was. Borthwick, Drummond Wolf and\r\nothers took it to refer to Lord Beaconsfield, and upon that mistake the\r\nPrimrose League was founded! Lord Beaconsfield loved all trees and all\r\nflowers except the chrysanthemum—“the only vulgar flower”—he once said to\r\nme; but chrysanthemums have been wonderfully improved since his day. The\r\nQueen had been in the habit of talking much to Lord Beaconsfield about\r\nthe Prince Consort, and his sympathy never failed her. He would have\r\nunderstood the Queen’s meaning when she spoke of “his” favourite flower.\r\nIt was a tender and a gracious thought to lay upon that grave a nosegay\r\nof the humble flower which was dear to her because it had been dear to\r\nthe husband whom she had lost and whom she had never ceased to mourn.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June I had to go and see Dean Stanley in order to settle\r\nwith him the place in Westminster Abbey for Lord Beaconsfield’s statue—a\r\nlast sad duty in connection with the dead Chief. The Dean suggested the\r\nposition where the statue now stands—I concurred—“and,” said he, “I\r\nshall put Gladstone there, facing him.” Very shortly afterwards I had\r\nto go abroad, and at St. Moritz I received the news of the dear Dean’s\r\ndeath. Mr. Gladstone, whom he intended to “place there,” survived him by\r\nseventeen years.\r\n\r\nThat was the last time that I saw Dean Stanley, with whom I often had\r\nofficial relations, rendered the pleasanter in that he was a connection\r\nof my wife’s and the much loved friend of her family. As we were leaving\r\nthe Abbey, I made some remark about the vandals who carve and write their\r\nnames in the most sacred places. “Yes,” he said, “but even in these\r\noutrages there are sometimes compensations,” and he led me to a place\r\nwhere, scratched on the wall, were the letters I. W., saying, “Isaac\r\nWalton, I truly believe.”\r\n\r\nDean Stanley was a little man, insignificant in stature, rather shabbily\r\ndressed, with a sharply cut nose and chin, a keen, penetrating look.\r\nHis lustrous eyes would sometimes blaze up as if lighted by some hidden\r\nflame. He was not exactly eloquent, nor great in conversation. But when\r\nhe was excited his enthusiasm was arresting and infectious. His great\r\ncharm was universally acknowledged even by his bitterest theological\r\nopponents, and personally, everybody loved him, from the Queen downwards.\r\nHe and his wife were among her trustiest friends. His attitude to the\r\ndogmas of the Churches was that of St. Paul to “Jewish fables.” His\r\nChristianity was the teaching of Christ. I have often thought that,\r\nunless the haziest of traditions be absolutely worthless, the small,\r\neager, dark man that was St. Paul must have been very like Dean Stanley.\r\nBoth zealots, both fierce fighters, both so lovable.\r\n\r\nOne last word about Lord Beaconsfield. The abuse that has been showered\r\nupon him would fill volumes. No less has been written in his defence. He\r\nhas been accused of being an adventurer, a pretentious fop, an impostor,\r\na self-seeking charlatan, who by some uncanny means contrived to cajole\r\nthe Tory party, and to become master of the landed gentry of England.\r\nNothing could be more untrue. Had he been what his detractors described\r\nhim, he never could have won the confidence of perhaps the most exclusive\r\ncaste in the whole world.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Disraeli was an aristocrat to his fingers’ tips. He belonged\r\nby descent to the Sephardim, that proud race of Jews who, “in the time\r\nof Cicero, had been settled immemorially in Spain.”[43] Theirs was a\r\nnobility which dated back by tradition to Abraham, that Arab chieftain\r\nwhose wanderings from the fringe of the desert to Damascus and Padan-Aram\r\nare recorded in the Book of Genesis. “That,” says a great writer who is\r\nno friend to the Jews, “is nobility in the fullest sense of the word,\r\ngenuine nobility of race! Beautiful forms, noble heads, dignity in speech\r\nand deportment ... that out of such men prophets and psalmists should go\r\nforth, that I understood at the first glance.” Those words might stand\r\nfor a portrait of Disraeli.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy to which he belonged sprang from another continent,\r\nanother world from ours; but alien though it might be, it brought\r\nhim into close sympathy with the bluest blood in England, and that,\r\nI take it, is why he was able to gain an intimate personal influence\r\nin the inner sanctuaries of politics and of society which had never\r\nbeen achieved by men springing from the middle class, not even by Sir\r\nRobert Peel. “When I was a young and struggling man,” he is reported\r\nto have said shortly before his death, “they taunted me with being an\r\nadventurer. Now that I have succeeded they still bring the same reproach\r\nagainst me. Me! whose ancestors may have had personal relations with the\r\nQueen of Sheba!” It was a jest expressing a conviction, for, like the\r\npoet Heine—also a Jew by birth, a Christian by confession, in whom the\r\nPhilhellenic attraction of years paled before the romance of the Old\r\nTestament—as he grew older he became more and more imbued with a sacred\r\nsense of ancestry.\r\n\r\nNo mere vulgar adventurer could have welded into shape the Young England\r\nparty—his first great political achievement. Lord John Manners, Baillie\r\nCochrane (Lord Lamington), George Smythe, afterwards Lord Strangford,\r\nwere men of family, high culture, and distinction. Not for one moment\r\nwould they have admitted to their intimacy, and fallen under the sway\r\nof, a man whom they did not deem their equal. But Benjamin Disraeli,\r\nthe descendant of the Princes of the Desert, possessed a magnetic spark\r\nof the mysterious sacred fire which made him as welcome to those great\r\nDames who ruled Almack’s with a rod of iron as to Kensington Gore,\r\nwhere D’Orsay was King and Lady Blessington Queen of a society half\r\naristocratic, half Bohemian, wholly delightful. This it was which finally\r\nenabled him to win over and mould to his purpose the haughty magnates of\r\nthe Carlton Club.\r\n\r\nAlmost all his associations, almost all his friends, were among those\r\nwhose forbears had made history. He was fascinated by the power of race,\r\nthough sometimes he could not help remembering that even the descendants\r\nof Crusaders were but the mushroom aristocracy of a single night by the\r\nside of those of the courtiers of King Solomon. “Don’t talk to me of\r\ndukes! Dukes can be made!” he said impatiently on a memorable occasion\r\nwhen a great public dinner was kept waiting for a duke who was to take\r\nthe chair. But those were mere passing whims. To the end the ladies\r\nwhose society he courted were those who had been foremost queens of\r\nfashion in his boyish days. The Russian Ambassador might sneer at them as\r\nbeing “toutes grand’mères,”—for Dizzy, their race endowed them with the\r\ncharm of eternal youth; he enwrapped them in a poetical halo which had\r\nthe magic power of the Fontaine de Jouvence. Chief among them were the\r\nthree beautiful Forester sisters—Lady Chesterfield, Mrs. Anson and Lady\r\nBradford. Mrs. Anson died comparatively young, but the other two sisters\r\nreigned as goddesses in his Olympus so long as he lived. Tithonus grows\r\nold; Aurora never.\r\n\r\nAmong his male friends there was none of whom he spoke with such\r\naffectionate admiration as he did of Count D’Orsay. Dandy, wit and\r\nartist, recognized as the handsomest man of his day, the grandson of\r\na King, the spoilt child of society in Paris and London—the brilliant\r\nFrenchman appealed to an Oriental imagination which, as is well known,\r\nwas always dazzled by splendour and colour. I never saw Count D’Orsay,\r\nfor he died when I was but fifteen years old, and he had left England for\r\na year or two before that; but according to the testimony of such various\r\nmen as my father, Lord Beaconsfield, Jem Macdonald, Alfred Montgomery,\r\nand others he must have been a striking personality, exceptionally gifted\r\nand attractive. Even the great Duke of Wellington could not resist his\r\nfascination.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned some of the men to whom Dizzy was attached, but\r\nthere was one for whom he entertained an especial liking and respect,\r\nthough in him, as his estimate of him quoted by Monypenny shows, he was\r\nsensible of some shortcomings. Apart from ancient lineage, which he\r\nlacked, Lord Lyndhurst possessed many of the beauties, both of mind and\r\nform, in which Lord Beaconsfield recognized the hero. When I knew him the\r\nex-Chancellor was a very old man, for he died at the age of ninety-one\r\nin 1863. Aged as he was, his mind was as active and bright as ever, and\r\nthough he wore a wig, he retained to the end something more than traces\r\nof the splendid masculine beauty for which he had once been famous. I\r\nhave heard men say that when he delivered one of his great speeches he\r\nwas as good to look upon as he was to hear. He was at one time threatened\r\nwith blindness, but mercifully his eyes were saved. It was a green old\r\nage, noble and beautiful, tended by the love of wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nHis memory was prodigious. I remember one remarkable instance of it. I\r\nwas dining one night at his house in George Street, Hanover Square, when\r\nthere were two or three racing grandees present—among them Baron Meyer de\r\nRothschild (Lady Rosebery’s father), Sir Robert Peel, and Lord Coventry.\r\nBaron Meyer had at that time a mare called Tomyris about which there was\r\nsome excitement among Turfites. “Baron, what made you call that mare of\r\nyours Tomȳris?” asked Sir Robert, with a strong accent on the second\r\nsyllable. “I’m sure I don’t know,” answered the Baron, “I suppose because\r\nshe’s by King Tom.” But the old Lord had caught Sir Robert’s false\r\nquantity. “Tomȳris! who said Tomȳris?” he asked. “Don’t you remember the\r\nstory of Tomȳris the Queen of the Massagetæ who conquered and killed\r\nCyrus?” and then he went off at score telling the gruesome legend of\r\nhow, to avenge the death of her son, she caused the dead King’s head to\r\nbe cut off and put into a skin filled with human blood, saying: “You\r\nwanted to drink blood, now drink your fill of it!” And then the old Lord\r\nadded: “You will find the whole story at the end of the first book of\r\nHerodotus.” When I got home I looked up the passage. Surely a marvellous\r\nexample of memory.\r\n\r\nImmersed as he had been in law and politics for seventy years—a\r\nlife-time—how many years must have passed since he could have had leisure\r\nto read Herodotus? Outside his own house I never met him but once. There\r\nwas a great ball at Apsley House, and the grand old Chancellor had\r\nhimself carried upstairs and wheeled into the ballroom to see the young\r\nfolk dance. I was standing by his chair when the Duke of Wellington came\r\nup to bid him welcome. There was a touch of pathos in the handsome old\r\nman’s voice as he said, “Ah! time was when I used to skip up those stairs\r\ngaily enough, when I came to see your dear father.” The great Duke was\r\nbut three years older than Lord Lyndhurst, but he had already been dead\r\nsome ten years. The two had not only been political allies when Lord\r\nLyndhurst was Chancellor in the Duke’s Administration, but they were firm\r\nfriends, and the affection lived in the survivor when the friendship had\r\nceased to be aught but a happy memory.\r\n\r\nTo us who loved him, Lord Beaconsfield remains a brilliant and an\r\ninspiring memory; of those who did not love him I believe that none would\r\nnow even listen to the malignity with which he was once assailed. Though\r\nthey disapprove of his principles, they admit that he was actuated by no\r\nselfish motives and that under his rule England was governed in a spirit\r\nof true patriotism. That verdict would have been the realization of all\r\nhis ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Henry Lennox was First Commissioner of Works when I was appointed\r\nSecretary. He was not at all in a frame of mind to be in love with the\r\nbusiness of the department. In fact he was a disappointed man, deeply\r\nhurt at not being in the Cabinet and not a little angry at seeing a\r\nrival, Mr. Ward Hunt, made First Lord of the Admiralty, an office to\r\nwhich he conceived himself to have a just claim. This put an end to the\r\nold affectionate friendship which Mr. Buckle has recorded as existing\r\nbetween him and the Chief. He never forgave the indignity which he\r\nconsidered had been put upon him. As he once said of himself, he had\r\ninherited something of the character of his French ancestress, Louise de\r\nKéroualle.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli was a much abused man, but I doubt whether in all England\r\nhe was spoken of with such venomous acerbity as he was by Lord Henry;\r\nand although after he had left the Ministry, and when Lord Beaconsfield\r\nreturned from Berlin in 1878, he took upon himself more or less to\r\norganize the reception at Charing Cross, that was done for peculiar and\r\npersonal reasons; the poison never ceased to rankle. Lord Henry took very\r\nlittle interest in the business of the office, and it was not an easy\r\nmatter to get him even to pay attention to the Estimates which it was his\r\nduty to defend in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, after vain endeavours on my part to coach him up in\r\nthe details of the various votes, he gathered up his papers at the last\r\nmoment, and saying: “Impudence befriend me!” put on his hat and hurried\r\naway. Impudence did befriend him, for when the vote for the Royal Parks\r\ncame on some member who “wanted to know,” asked “What is the Longford\r\nRiver?” (as a matter of fact the Longford River is an aqueduct made in\r\nCharles the First’s time for the supply of water to Hampton Court Palace;\r\nfor some mysterious reason best known to themselves the Treasury included\r\nthe estimate for its maintenance in the Parks vote). Lord Henry, who had\r\nnot the remotest idea of what the Longford River was, looked sternly\r\nwith an air of rebuke at the too inquisitive member, and answered, “The\r\nLongford River, sir, is one of the Royal Parks.” I, sitting under the\r\nGallery, was in an agony, but the House did not so much as smile. Had the\r\nLongford River been included in the vote for Royal Palaces—which is where\r\nit ought to have been—he probably would have told the House that it was\r\none of the Royal Palaces.\r\n\r\nThose were halcyon days for ministers, who were seldom or never worried\r\nover their Estimates by inquisitorial members; days when the numberless\r\ncomplicated votes of the Office of Works were run through in a sitting\r\nalmost without a question. The heckling of ministers was an instrument of\r\ntorture invented a few years later by that brilliant brotherhood known\r\nas the Fourth Party, under the lead of Lord Randolph Churchill, and\r\nafterwards carried on with much self-satisfaction and unction by such\r\nmen as Sir George Campbell, an old Indian official, Mr. Peter Rylands,\r\nthe “Good old Peter gone wrong,” over whose defection upon the Home Rule\r\nquestion Mr. Gladstone shed oratorical tears, and others. Under their\r\nunited attacks the defence of Estimates became a ministerial nightmare.\r\n\r\nOne day I met Lord Randolph in the Park; it was the morning after a\r\nseries of awkward moments which my chief, the Liberal Government being\r\nthen in power, had been undergoing—I suffering vicariously, a dumb dog\r\nunder the Gallery. We walked together, and at last I said: “My dear\r\nRandolph, for goodness sake leave my unhappy Estimates alone!” “Very\r\nsorry for you, my dear fellow,” was the answer, “but we must harass the\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\nAnd harass them he did, for that was an art in which, even in those early\r\ndays of a Parliamentary career which became so famous, he was already\r\nan adept. He held stoutly to the creed that it was the duty of Her\r\nMajesty’s Opposition (who invented that phrase?) to oppose, and he acted\r\nup to his belief with all the great strength that was in him.\r\n\r\nRandolph, as I first knew him, was the most delightful of boys, bubbling\r\nover with fun and the sweetest devilry, devoted to his father, idolizing\r\nhis mother, that great Lady whom those whom she admitted to her intimacy\r\nwere fain to worship; ready to sacrifice himself and incur for his\r\nbrother’s sake what to most men would have been akin to social torture.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached young-manhood and was already giving to a budding\r\nmoustache the hoist made famous by John Tenniel and the caricaturists, he\r\nwas always ready to give up any pleasure of his own if he could be of any\r\nuse to one of those dear to him. His patience as a chaperon was saintly.\r\nWho could help loving him? Not I, for one—I treasure the memory of his\r\nfriendship as one of the most precious recollections of a long life.\r\n\r\nBy his desire I was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of his\r\nbrother; him too I had known from a boy, a youth of great promise marred\r\nby fate, shining in many branches of human endeavour, clever, capable of\r\ngreat industry, and within measurable distance of reaching conspicuous\r\nsuccess in science, mathematics and mechanics, when his early death\r\nsnapped the thread of what might have been a brilliant career, had not\r\nthe gods willed it otherwise.\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill’s memory has been crystallized by his brilliant\r\nson in one of the three best biographies in the English language, and\r\nhe has, moreover, been celebrated in a sketch written by his friend and\r\nschoolfellow, Lord Rosebery. What more is there to say?\r\n\r\nThe sad story of his resignation of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer\r\nhas been often told. A few days later he and his old crony and mine,\r\nSir George Wombwell, now, alas! no more, but then one of the very few\r\nsurviving officers of the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava,\r\nwere staying with me at Batsford. With the intimacy of old friends we\r\ntalked of the bolt which he had hurled out of the blue. I can see him\r\nnow leaning against the chimney-piece in the library when he said, “I\r\nnever thought of that damned fellow Goschen.” He believed, and he was\r\nvery nearly right, that he held all the trump cards in his hand, and that\r\nhe could dictate his own terms as to that reduction of expenditure upon\r\nwhich he was bent. He did not suspect that Goschen was ready to take his\r\nplace. Almost in the same breath, in answer to a question of mine about\r\nLord Salisbury’s attitude, he exclaimed: “That man is an angel!” and then\r\nwent on to express regret, I am bound to say in no measured terms, as to\r\nthe female influence by which the great Marquis had allowed himself to\r\nbe dominated. Over and over again he insisted upon his affection for his\r\nchief, and dwelt with strong expressions of gratitude upon the kindness\r\nwhich he had received from him. It was a touching tribute, coming from\r\nthe heart; a noble heart, which at that moment must have been feeling\r\nbruised and sore, but was incapable of nurturing an ungenerous animosity.\r\n\r\nNot long after my first appearance in the House of Commons, the fatal\r\nillness to which he fell a victim began to assert itself. We who\r\nloved him watched his gradually failing utterances in great sorrow.\r\nHe struggled bravely, but it was in vain. The House, a just and even\r\ngenerous assembly, remembered the lightning flashes by which it had been\r\nelectrified but a short time back—the bold and vigorous attacks when the\r\nyoung Ivanhoe tilted at the shield of the veteran Templar—the scathing\r\ncriticism of foes—the magnanimous defence of friends. Members from the\r\nfront benches downwards listened with respect; but it was manifestly the\r\nend: the highly-strung, passionate nature had broken down, and there was\r\nno hope. But all this belongs to later years: I am writing here of a time\r\nwhen Randolph Churchill was still a merry, devil-may-care youth just\r\nentering upon the first phase of his Parliamentary life as the spoilt\r\nchild of politics.\r\n\r\nThe mention of such a name as his calls up memories, and when I begin\r\nremembering my humble chronology is scattered to the winds, and, as\r\nusual, I wander. I ought to have kept the few lines which I feel\r\ncompelled to write in loving memory of him for any notes which I could\r\nmake of my days in the House of Commons; but I can only tell my story in\r\nmy own untidy way.\r\n\r\nLord Henry Lennox was succeeded in 1876 by Mr. Gerard Noel, who had been\r\nthe chief Parliamentary Whip of the Tory party. He was a most delightful\r\npersonality, whom everybody liked and respected, and it was a real\r\nhappiness to work under him. Much of the business of the office was very\r\ncongenial to him and he took the greatest interest in everything that\r\nconcerned the Royal Parks. What a joy it must be to have the tact and the\r\npower of pleasing that he had!—to feel that every man is glad to see you\r\nand welcome you, every man sorry when the time comes to say farewell! And\r\nMr. Adam, who succeeded him, for the Office of Works seemed to be the\r\nheritage of First Whips, was just such another.\r\n\r\nIf some good fairy were to ask me to choose a gift with which to enter\r\nthe world, I should ask for tact, and I should wish it to be just such\r\ntact as was possessed by Mr. Noel and Mr. Adam. The reign of the latter\r\nlasted but a short time, for at the end of 1880 he was appointed to go as\r\nGovernor to Madras, and then he paid me the handsomest compliment that\r\none man could offer to another. Though civil servants, of course, put\r\ntheir politics in their pockets so long as they are in office, he knew\r\nquite well that I belonged to the opposite camp, but in spite of that\r\nhe asked me to go with him to India as secretary. I could not accept,\r\nfor the appointment was one which would cease with his governorship. In\r\nspite of that, had I been unmarried, I think I should have gone with him,\r\nfor he was one of those men whom it is a joy to serve. In less than six\r\nmonths he died in India, so I should have been stranded.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw Lefevre followed Mr. Adam as First Commissioner. By one of\r\nthose wonderful inconsistencies, which, thanks to the ability and\r\ndevotion of the permanent civil servants of the Crown, England, in\r\nsome incomprehensible way, manages to survive, Mr. Shaw Lefevre, who\r\nhad devoted his whole life and energies to the solution of problems\r\nconnected with the land, had been sent to the sea, and made Secretary to\r\nthe Admiralty. But being a man of ability and industry, he was obviously\r\nmarked for promotion. He had a great power of mastering detail and was a\r\nmost valuable exponent in Parliament of the very complicated Estimates\r\nof his department which, in addition to all the services which it now\r\ncontrols, had at that time to deal with the Ordnance Survey, Kew Gardens\r\nand those parks (Victoria, Kennington and Battersea) which are now\r\nmanaged by the County Council. Mr. Shaw Lefevre, moreover, though as\r\nFirst Commissioner he did not have a seat in the Cabinet, had the knack\r\nof bringing great influence to bear upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nand was thus able to push through more than one useful scheme, some of\r\nwhich had been periodically shelved.\r\n\r\nThe last two months of 1882 were a busy time for the Office of Works.\r\nOn the 18th of November the Queen reviewed the troops that had come\r\nback from Egypt on the Horse Guards Parade in St. James’ Park. The\r\narrangements for the review, erection of stands, issue of tickets and\r\nother details fell upon us. It was a difficult undertaking on account of\r\nthe smallness of the space; however, we got through it without a hitch.\r\nLord Wolseley was delighted; and came up to me in the evening, saying,\r\n“To-day was your triumph.”\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley was always very friendly to me. I used to meet him\r\nvery often at Eastwell during the tenancy of the Duke and Duchess of\r\nEdinburgh, with whom he was intimate, and we often had long and very\r\ninteresting talks. Like most successful men—and he was very successful—he\r\nhad his enemies; but also, like most men who have rendered good services\r\nand done really great work in the world, I always found him as singularly\r\nmodest about his own achievements as he was firm in his opinions,\r\nespecially as regarded administration. Naturally the _noli me tangere_\r\nschool dreaded and disliked him.\r\n\r\nA very serious matter, which gave rise to no little anxiety, was the\r\nopening of the Law Courts by Queen Victoria on the 4th of December.\r\nThe Government were seriously alarmed lest there should be any attempt\r\nupon Her Majesty’s life by Fenians, who had been giving a great deal\r\nof trouble. In Ireland there had been many murders, the chief and most\r\ntragic of which was that of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke, on\r\nthe 7th of May, and it was known that plots had been hatched for the\r\nblowing up of public buildings and monuments in England.\r\n\r\nA marked man among the conspirators, who had hitherto eluded all\r\nendeavours to arrest him, was one Tynan, known among the fraternity as\r\n“Number One,” a rebel who, it was believed, would hesitate at no crime.\r\nIt was a time of anxiety which, as after events, such as the attempts to\r\nblow up the Tower, London Bridge and the House of Commons, proved was not\r\nwithout justification, and I was in daily communication with Sir Edmund\r\nHenderson, the Chief Commissioner of Police. He was a delightful man to\r\ndo business with, so wise, so cool and imperturbable—a man who inspired\r\nconfidence. He had, moreover, a rare sense of fun and humour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Fenian activities the opening of the new Law Courts was held\r\nto be a national and historic occasion of such importance that it was\r\nfitting that the opening ceremony should be performed by the Queen. Her\r\nMajesty, who might well have felt a little nervous, was not the sort\r\nof person to shirk a duty on account of danger. She had the gift of\r\nindomitable courage and did not hesitate for a moment.\r\n\r\nNaturally every precaution was taken. On the evening before the opening I\r\nwas sent, with a strong force of police, the clerk of the works and two\r\nor three trusty workmen to go over the whole building and see that there\r\nwas no person and nothing dangerous concealed anywhere. We searched the\r\nplace from cellar to roof, leaving a policeman at every door; immediately\r\nunder the spot where the Queen was to stand we found a mysterious and\r\nmost suspicious box: there was some alarm and there were some blank\r\nfaces, but the clerk of the works came up and the guilty-looking box\r\nwas able to prove its innocence; it contained nothing but a few broken\r\nornamental tiles which the workmen had forgotten to take away.\r\n\r\nAfter the examination of the building my orders were to go to the\r\n_Times_ office and draw up a memorandum stating what had been done, the\r\nGovernment knowing that there was much uneasiness which it would be well\r\nto allay.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid ceremonial and the whole affair passed off\r\nprosperously, though I may say in passing that there was one feeling of\r\ndeep regret among all who knew him, that Mr. Street, the architect, a man\r\nof perfect distinction, had died the previous year. Had he lived he would\r\nundoubtedly have received the honour of knighthood in the great hall\r\nwhich his genius had designed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s presence on the occasion bore good fruit. Not only did it\r\ngive an immense amount of pleasure to her people, but politically it was\r\nof great avail in calming anxiety.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the curious part of the story. The guard of honour outside\r\nthe Courts was furnished by the Queen’s Westminster Volunteers. The\r\nnext day, in Whitehall Place, I met Colonel Bushby, who commanded them.\r\nHe was in a state of great agitation. He told me that he had just\r\ndiscovered, to his horror, that the centre file of the guard of honour\r\nwas no other than Tynan, the famous Number One! It seems that the man\r\nhad enlisted, bringing unexceptionable letters of recommendation, and\r\nhad been an excellent recruit, nobody suspecting anything wrong. When\r\nit was known that the regiment was to furnish the guard of honour, he\r\nwent to the orderly room where the Colonel and Adjutant were, and begged\r\nto be allowed to serve on it. They refused on the ground that he was\r\nnot tall enough; however, he prayed so earnestly, saying that he was\r\nleaving England for good at once, and it would be such a pride to him in\r\nafter days to think of this honour, that they were touched by the man’s\r\nenthusiasm and Colonel Bushby said, “Well, if we make you the centre file\r\nit won’t so much matter, so we will let you serve.”\r\n\r\nHow the discovery was made I do not remember, but poor Bushby was on\r\nhis way to Sir Edmund Henderson to make a clean breast of it. Meanwhile\r\nthe man had disappeared, and I believe was not heard of again. It made\r\nme shudder to think what might easily have happened in spite of all\r\nprecautions, had the man meant to do the evil thing of which he was\r\nsupposed to be capable. Evidently the Devil was not so black as his\r\nportrait. Needless to say, the Queen was never told all this.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at the office that morning I found a charming little note\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone—always so gracious—telling me that he had recommended\r\nme to the Queen for the honour of C.B.; also a note from Sir Henry\r\nPonsonby, saying, “I think you deserve to be congratulated on yesterday’s\r\nproceedings. They were most successful and the Queen highly pleased.”\r\n\r\nWhen I went to Windsor to be invested, the Queen sent afterwards to\r\ndesire me to write my name in her private book. I mention this because,\r\nby a curious coincidence, the name preceding mine was that of my old\r\nchief, Sir Harry Parkes.\r\n\r\nHere is one amusing story in connection with the Fenian scare which,\r\nafter all these years, it can do no harm to tell. The police had received\r\nintelligence that a certain rich Irish-American was starting from New\r\nYork with the intention of blowing up the Albert Memorial in Kensington\r\nGardens. Sir Edmund Henderson came to see me and told me all about it,\r\nand the steps which he considered ought to be taken. The man arrived\r\nat Liverpool and, I need hardly say, was met by his shadow. Reaching\r\nLondon, he drove to Long’s Hotel in Bond Street, and within an hour or\r\ntwo, drove straight to the Memorial, where he found a number of quiet,\r\ninoffensive-looking people absorbed in the contemplation of the various\r\nsculptures. This happened two or three days in succession, after which\r\nhe changed his hotel. He had plenty of money and spent his evenings in\r\namusing himself at theatres and music halls. But in the day-time the\r\nattraction of the Albert Memorial was irresistible. It was unfortunate\r\nfor his schemes that so many other people should all of a sudden be\r\nequally fascinated by its charms.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing came to an end in an unexpected way. One night, after\r\nthe play, the would-be iconoclast was driving to St. John’s Wood with a\r\nlady, when the driver of his hansom cab became aware that another cab was\r\nfollowing them. The driver of the hansom was a good-natured fellow, and,\r\nthinking that his fare was being watched for divorce proceedings, told\r\nhim what he had seen. The game was up, and it was a case of stalemate.\r\nThe Irishman knew that he was found out, and the police had nothing\r\ntangible upon which they could act. So there was disappointment for\r\nthe one player, and a rapid return to America for the other. When the\r\ngood-natured cabman, being questioned, told the detective how he had let\r\nthe cat out of the bag and spoilt sport, he was perhaps the sorest of the\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1883, I had a very interesting experience.\r\nThere was a scheme on foot for uniting the north and south of western\r\nLondon by an underground railway, which would have been carried under a\r\npart of Hyde Park. It was essential that the Queen’s pleasure should be\r\ntaken upon the subject, and I was instructed to go to Balmoral in order\r\nto explain to Her Majesty exactly what had been proposed.\r\n\r\nThere was an idea abroad that to tunnel under the Park would drain the\r\nsoil of all natural moisture, and even that the roots of the trees would\r\nbe affected. Whatever reasons there might be against the project, I felt\r\nsure that this danger was exaggerated. Looking at the plane trees and the\r\ncatalpas by the Houses of Parliament, it was evident that the underground\r\nrailway had done them no harm. I went to Kew in order to consult Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker as to the maximum depth to which the roots of trees reach.\r\nHe told me that very little was understood upon the subject, and he knew\r\nof no authoritative writer to whom he could refer me. However, after\r\nsome search he unearthed a French pamphlet which was full of interest.\r\nFrom this it appeared that in proportion to its height wheat is probably\r\nthe plant which sends down the deepest roots; this would account for\r\nthe prosperity of the plant in dry seasons when other crops fail. Of\r\ntrees the vine was said to be the deepest; as a denizen of the limestone\r\nrocks its roots have to travel far, piercing through chinks and crannies\r\nin order to seek water. This was interesting, because it showed that\r\npossibly the old story that the great vine at Hampton Court sends its\r\nroots out all the way to the Thames may be true. Since that time a tree\r\nclosely allied to the laburnum was discovered in India, which sent its\r\nroots so deep that they broke off in a deep well long before their ends\r\nwere found. In any case it was clear that the roots of the trees in Hyde\r\nPark, all of which are very shallow, would not be affected. But this is a\r\nmere parenthesis.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Ballater in the afternoon of the 12th of November, prepared\r\nto take a room at the inn and go on to Balmoral after a bath. However,\r\nat the station I found a carriage and a footman with a note saying that\r\nI was to go on and sleep at Balmoral. It was bitterly cold and snowing\r\nheavily, but when I reached the Castle a second note from Sir Henry\r\nPonsonby was awaiting me. “Please go to your room, order tea and make\r\nyourself comfortable. We are off to a picnic.”\r\n\r\nIt was real Queen’s weather, for she loved the cold, as I well knew,\r\nfor whenever we had to prepare for any ceremony at which she was to be\r\npresent, we had to watch the thermometer jealously. As for me, I sat\r\nhuddled up, dozing over the fire, thinking that if I were a polar bear\r\nI might possibly enjoy such weather, when, after a couple of hours, Sir\r\nHenry Ponsonby came in looking frozen. We had a little talk while he\r\nthawed and then he left me. Presently there came a knock at the door and\r\na page announced, “Mr. Mitford is to dine with the Queen this evening.”\r\n\r\nAt dinner—quite a small party—I sat next to Princess Beatrice, who was\r\non the Queen’s right, and Her Majesty talked a great deal to me across\r\nthe Princess. She was in great spirits, and her conversation, as always,\r\nwas most interesting. She had such a fund of knowledge and her memory\r\nwas so rich that it was a delight to listen to her. Without for a moment\r\nsacrificing one jot of that dignity for which she was famous the Queen\r\nhad a great sense of humour. Perhaps it was her appreciation of wit that\r\nwas one of the secrets of the favour in which Sir Henry Ponsonby was so\r\nlong held at Court, for he was a man of a most delicate wit, and without\r\ncompare the best note-writer that I ever came across.\r\n\r\nThe talk at the Queen’s table, when the numbers were so small as to\r\nmake it more or less intimate, was gay, lively, and, when Her Majesty\r\ndrew upon her own recollections, illuminating. After dinner in the\r\ndrawing-room each guest had his little audience. When it came to be\r\nmy turn to be sent for I supposed that the Queen would allude to the\r\nbusiness which had brought me, but upon that she was studiously silent,\r\ntalking upon every conceivable subject with all the conversational talent\r\nof a consummately informed woman of the world.\r\n\r\nThe next day the snow had come to an end, the weather was glorious,\r\nthe air crisp and sharp, and I had a long walk with my old friend, Sir\r\nWalter Campbell, who was groom-in-waiting. But there was still no word\r\nof business. In the evening I was again summoned to dine with the Queen,\r\nand after dinner had my audience, at which, as before, Her Majesty very\r\ndelightfully avoided any mention of business, treating me in all respects\r\nas if I had been an invited guest instead of a mere official on duty.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast on the following morning there came a knock\r\nat my door. It was the Duchess of Roxburghe bringing me from the Queen a\r\ncopy of the large illustrated edition of her “Journal in the Highlands”\r\nwith her autograph. She also told me the hour at which the Queen would\r\nsee me to discuss my business. Her Majesty went very carefully into the\r\nwhole scheme, examining the plans and criticizing them minutely; she\r\nended by saying, rather sadly: “But I so seldom go to London now that\r\nI hardly feel as if I had the right to express an opinion.” My answer\r\nwas: “I only wish, Madam, that we at the Office of Works oftener had the\r\nopportunity of profiting by Your Majesty’s advice.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen dismissed me with great kindness and I left the Castle that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe congestion of the traffic at Hyde Park Corner caused by the\r\nincreasing railway business at Victoria Station had long been a\r\ndifficulty confronting the Office of Works. Decimus Burton’s arch,\r\nstanding flush with Piccadilly, was then the entrance to the Green Park.\r\nOn it, to the lasting sorrow of the architect, stood the colossal statue\r\nof the Duke of Wellington on horseback, by Matthew Wyatt. A work of art\r\nwhich provoked from a French general the grateful cry, “Enfin nous sommes\r\nvengés.”\r\n\r\nVarious schemes were brought forward to solve the difficulty; none was\r\nsatisfactory. It was obvious that a wider approach to Grosvenor Place was\r\nessential to success. There were many obstacles in the way, the chief of\r\nwhich was the difference in levels. Old people will remember that the\r\napproach to the Green Park from Grosvenor Place was by a narrow passage,\r\na steep slope at the north-west end of Buckingham Palace garden. Had we\r\nbeen dealing with a bare piece of virgin ground without limitations no\r\ndoubt a better scheme might have been possible; but to carry out such\r\na plan would have involved taking a large slice off the Green Park and\r\nanother off the end of the Palace garden—neither was practicable.\r\n\r\nAn infinitesimal piece of the park was conceded, but there still remained\r\nthe difficulty of the arch, which would have remained in an absurd\r\nisland, perched up on a hillock above the surrounding roads. I proposed\r\nthat it should be removed and placed where it now stands, at the end of\r\nConstitution Hill. I showed the plan, which was prepared accordingly by\r\nMr.—afterwards Sir—John Taylor, to Mr. Gerard Noel, who was then First\r\nCommissioner of Works. He took it to Lord Beaconsfield. The Government\r\ndid not wish to spend any money—a chronic condition of things—and the\r\nPrime Minister crushed the scheme with a _bon mot_. “Do away with the\r\ncongestion of traffic at Hyde Park Corner? Why, my dear fellow, you\r\nwould be destroying one of the sights of London!” And so for the time\r\nthe plan was laughed out of court and pigeon-holed. In 1884 Mr. Shaw\r\nLefevre persuaded the Government to take in hand a matter which was daily\r\nbecoming more urgent. The scheme was carried out.\r\n\r\nNaturally, in order to remove the arch, the statue must come down, and\r\nthen came the great question, Was it to go back again? This was just the\r\nsort of problem which would provoke violent differences of opinion. I\r\nhad a great deal of talk about it with the Prince of Wales, who took the\r\nliveliest interest in it, and finally appointed a committee of advice,\r\nwhich met at Marlborough House and at which he took the chair.[44] The\r\ntwo protagonists for replacing the statue and against so doing were the\r\nDukes of Rutland and Wellington. Filial piety prompted the former to\r\nstand up stoutly for a statue erected by a committee of which his father\r\nhad been chairman; filial piety caused the Duke of Wellington to raise\r\nhis voice against replacing what he considered to be an insult to his\r\nfather’s memory. The duel became very comic. The Duke of Rutland wound up\r\nby saying that it would be a monstrous thing to banish a statue for which\r\nthe great Duke had sat to the sculptor in the very clothes which he wore\r\nat Waterloo. This the Duke felt to be unanswerable, and he looked round\r\nat us in triumph. “Nothing of the kind,” said the Duke of Wellington.\r\n“My father only sent his valet to the sculptor’s studio with a bag of\r\nclothes.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of further objections raised by Sir Stafford Northcote and Lord\r\nJohn Manners, the last of whom had been one of the speakers in the debate\r\nin the House of Commons in 1846 which resulted in the erection of the\r\nmonster, the Duke of Wellington’s bag of clothes, so far as the committee\r\nwas concerned, clinched the historic part of the discussion, and the\r\næsthetic side was not long in doubt. But there was still Parliament to\r\nbe faced. In the meantime the Prince went abroad, first to Darmstadt\r\nand then to Royat in Auvergne. In the House of Commons our proposals\r\nwere carried by a majority of one hundred and eleven, a result which I\r\ncommunicated to His Royal Highness, who wrote from Darmstadt on May 4th:\r\n“I rejoice with you at the majority of one hundred and eleven obtained\r\nin the House of Commons on the important matter which we have so much at\r\nheart.... Both you and your chief will, I am sure, agree with me that I\r\nwas right, when I saw you this day week, in insisting on being firm and\r\nrisking the result of the division. I have at any rate had my reward.”\r\nThe Prince wrote to me again from Royat in some anxiety upon the subject,\r\nwhich was to be brought forward in the Upper House by Lords de Ros and\r\nStratheden.\r\n\r\nHowever, all went well—for that time then present—but when I survey the\r\ngroup which now surmounts that unhappy arch, I feel as if we had escaped\r\nfrom the frying-pan into the fire. A motherly female of vast proportions\r\nstands in a car which might have served her baby’s doll. In one hand she\r\ncarries a palm branch, in the other a fragment of some mystic vegetable,\r\npossibly intended for an olive branch. The arms are placed in the\r\nposition adopted by the American barman when he performs his great feat\r\nof pouring a cocktail from one goblet into another. Her car is drawn by\r\nfour Iceland ponies, guided by a charioteer, apparently modelled from\r\none of the pygmies of the Aruwhimi forest, so skilfully concealed in the\r\ncarefully muddled group that only from one or two points on the further\r\nside of Piccadilly is the onlooker aware of his puny existence. And this\r\nmust remain for future ages as the last word of British sculpture at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century!\r\n\r\nAs regards the place itself, which has been severely criticized, and no\r\ndoubt with some show of reason, the difficulties have been forgotten, but\r\nI still think that the best was done that could have been effected in the\r\ncircumstances, and I would remind the cavillers of the lines written in\r\ndefence of General Wade’s roads in Scotland.\r\n\r\n    “If you’d known these roads before they were made\r\n    You’d see good cause to bless General Wade.”\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the Prince of Wales took me with him to Aldershot to\r\nselect a site for the old statue—and there it now stands.\r\n\r\nThe year 1884 was fraught with many emotions for Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nGovernment, and there was further trouble ahead. Egypt was the\r\nchief anxiety. On the 6th of November Henry Fawcett, the blind\r\nPostmaster-General, who, with superhuman courage, had defied fate and\r\nraised himself to the front rank among men, died. An opportunity occurred\r\nfor adding much needed strength to the Cabinet of which Mr. Fawcett, no\r\ndoubt on account of his infirmity, had not been a member. Lord Rosebery,\r\nwho had two years earlier resigned the Under-secretaryship of State for\r\nHome Affairs—an office which, I am not singular in thinking, ought never\r\nto have been offered to a man of his worth—rejoined the Government as\r\nFirst Commissioner of Works, with a seat in the Cabinet. In order to\r\nbalance the numbers of Peers and Commoners in that mysterious body which\r\nrules England without being known to the Constitution, Mr. Shaw Lefevre\r\nwas appointed Postmaster-General and raised to Cabinet rank.\r\n\r\nI shall not easily forget the pleasure with which I received a note\r\nfrom Lord Rosebery, whom I had known for many years, announcing his\r\nappointment and asking me to meet him at Euston Square and talk over\r\nmatters during the drive to Whitehall. Equally difficult is it to record\r\nthe many acts of kindness and consideration which I received during the\r\nfew months that I served under him.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery’s reign at the Office of Works was short, but long enough\r\nto make me wish that I might have kept so good a master longer. To say\r\nmore of a man so eminent would be presumptuous, to say less ungrateful.\r\nThe Government was moribund when he accepted office, and even he could\r\nnot galvanize it into new life. The tragedy of Khartoum in January,\r\n1885, had made Ministers very unpopular, and in the summer they fell.\r\nLord Salisbury’s first flash-in-the-pan administration lasted only a few\r\nmonths, but when Mr. Gladstone returned to power Lord Rosebery was called\r\nto higher functions.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Salisbury’s government was formed in 1885 Mr. Plunket\r\nbecame First Commissioner. Like Lord Rosebery’s, his rule was short\r\nbut delightful, for in the following January Mr. Jesse Collings’\r\nthree-acres-and-a-cow amendment to the address turned out the Government\r\nand Mr. Gladstone was once more Prime Minister. In the shuffling of the\r\ncards Lord Morley, afterwards Chairman of Committees in the House of\r\nLords, became our Lord Paramount. But here again the fates interfered\r\nwith what promised to be a most valuable administration. The Home Rule\r\nsplit came. Mr. Gladstone had thrown himself into the arms of the Irish\r\nNationalists and many of his followers were estranged from him.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April Lord Morley, who was an old friend of mine, told me\r\nconfidentially that he had resigned. He was the first Minister to do so.\r\nMr. Gladstone knew the value of the force of example and did all in his\r\npower to induce Lord Morley to reconsider his decision. He might as well\r\nhave tried to move the rock of Gibraltar. Lord Morley stuck to his guns\r\nand Lord Elgin was named in his place. He was the last chief under whom\r\nI served at the Office of Works, for in the month of May my cousin, Lord\r\nRedesdale, died, and I found myself faced by so much private business\r\nthat I resigned.\r\n\r\nI received many very flattering letters: I am prompted by vanity to copy\r\nthree of them. Sir Henry Ponsonby wrote:\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MITFORD,\r\n\r\n    “I did not answer your letter till I had seen the Queen on her\r\n    return from Scotland.\r\n\r\n    “She desired me to assure you that she heard of your\r\n    resignation with sincere regret, as Her Majesty considers you\r\n    have done your duty at your Office not only to her entire\r\n    satisfaction, but also in a manner which has proved to be of\r\n    great benefit to the public.\r\n\r\n    “Her Majesty feels very anxious as to who may be your successor\r\n    and commands me to ask if you have any suggestion to make.\r\n\r\n                           “Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                     (_Signed_) “HENRY F. PONSONBY.”\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Gladstone I received the following holograph letter:\r\n\r\n                                                   “June 24th, 1886.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MR. MITFORD,\r\n\r\n    “I received with very great regret the announcement of your\r\n    resignation, which at the same time I admit to be no desertion\r\n    on your part, but to be reasonable and just.\r\n\r\n    “But it will, I fear, be very difficult to fill your place with\r\n    a person possessed in the same degree with yourself of the\r\n    varied and high qualifications which it requires.\r\n\r\n    “Believe me,\r\n\r\n                        “Most faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                       (_Signed_) “W. E. GLADSTONE.”\r\n\r\nI had several letters on the subject from the Duke of Cambridge; some\r\nof them are of too confidential a character to be published, but I may\r\nreproduce part, at any rate, of one letter which he wrote me.\r\n\r\n    “June 23rd, 1886. It is with the _deepest_ regret that I find\r\n    from your letter that you have handed in your resignation.\r\n    You will be a very great loss to the office and to myself\r\n    personally as Ranger of the Royal Parks, for you have, by your\r\n    tact and judgment, been enabled to assist me in meeting so many\r\n    little difficulties, which in these times arise constantly in\r\n    connection with these parks.... Though our official connection\r\n    will, unfortunately, cease, I hope our personal one will be\r\n    continued as heretofore, and I shall at all times be only too\r\n    happy to talk over many little matters with you in which we\r\n    both take an interest.\r\n\r\n    “I remain,\r\n\r\n                         “Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                (_Signed_) “GEORGE.”\r\n\r\nFew men, whether princes, peers or peasants, have been so generally\r\npopular as the late Duke of Cambridge. Indeed, he had everything in his\r\nfavour. Tall, burly and athletic in his youth, and when I first knew\r\nhim, in the fifties, he was strikingly handsome, the perfect type of\r\nan Englishman. Gifted with a singularly frank and genial manner his\r\nsoldier-like bearing could not fail to arrest attention. In later years\r\nhe grew stout, but his goodly height enabled him to carry off the more\r\nample figure, and he remained vigorous and active, a keen sportsman at an\r\nage when most men no longer care to face the buffets of wind and weather.\r\nHis varied experience made him a most agreeable companion; he had seen\r\nactive service, and had had a horse shot under him in the Crimea; he had\r\ntravelled much and had had familiar intercourse with all the sovereigns\r\nand statesmen in Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was a capital after-dinner speaker; his downright, honest periods,\r\ngiven out with that sonorous and beautiful voice for which the\r\ndescendants of George the Third are famous, went straight home to the\r\nhearts of his audience. Probably nine out of ten of his speeches were\r\nin response to the toast of the Army, and right fitting it was that\r\nthey should be so, for he was, above all things, a soldier, devoted to\r\nthe Army, watchful over its interests, and, indeed, over those of every\r\nindividual member of it who came under his ken. The Duke’s mastery of\r\nthe working of the whole complex machinery of the Army was phenomenal.\r\nStill more extraordinary was his knowledge of its officers. This was\r\ndue to the fact that during the whole time of his tenure of office no\r\npromotion to any rank above that of captain was made without his personal\r\ninvestigation and sanction. In this way, being gifted with a singularly\r\nretentive memory, he had an intimate acquaintance with the careers and\r\ncapabilities of all the senior officers. He was no admirer of change for\r\nchange’s sake, and yet ready to accept it when he thought that opposition\r\nwould be against the interests of the Crown and of the service which\r\nhe loved. To that service he conscientiously gave up his life, being\r\nas convinced as was the great Duke of Wellington of the importance of\r\nmaintaining the closest bond between the Sovereign and the Army. It will\r\nbe remembered that on this ground the Duke of Wellington in 1850 went\r\nso far as to urge the acceptance by the Prince Consort of the office of\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The Duke of Cambridge looked upon that principle as a\r\nfamily, as well as a national, tradition.\r\n\r\nThere were many alterations introduced into the Army by various\r\nSecretaries of State which were certainly not to his taste, but he\r\nwas wise enough to see that the real alteration was in the spirit\r\nof the times, and he was enough of a patriot to yield where a\r\nstubborn opposition would have been useless, and in his judgment\r\ndangerous. Even so, he drew a firm line between the administrative\r\nand executive functions of the War Office. Whilst willing always\r\nto accept the Secretary of State as the administrative power, he\r\nbrooked no interference with his own executive duties. He was the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and there he insisted upon being master. The Duke\r\nwas always very outspoken upon these matters, perhaps more so with me\r\nthan with most people, from the fact that I had no direct interest in the\r\nArmy, no military axe to grind; and so I knew how entirely, upon more\r\nthan one occasion, he laid self on one side, content to work solely for\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s life was very full, for until the Prince of Wales reached\r\nmanhood it was upon him that many of the functions that the Royal Family\r\nhave to perform devolved; the Queen and Prince Albert only appearing on\r\nrare and special occasions. Charity dinners, the laying of foundation\r\nstones, hospital meetings and the hundred and one other duties which\r\nhe undertook in addition to the laborious work of Commander-in-Chief,\r\nwork which he never scamped and of which no detail escaped him, gave him\r\nlittle leisure. Half a dozen days’ shooting, to which he often did me the\r\nhonour to invite me, a country visit or two, and a rare trip abroad, were\r\nall the holidays that he allowed himself, and even when he travelled his\r\nwork followed him.\r\n\r\nThe abolition in 1895 of the office of Commander-in-Chief, an office\r\nwhich he had held for thirty-nine years, was a cruel blow to the Duke. It\r\nwas no consolation to him that in announcing his so-called resignation\r\nto the House of Commons on the 21st of June Mr. Campbell Bannerman\r\n(afterwards Sir Henry) should have plastered him with eulogy and shed\r\ncrocodile tears over his loss, and it must have been bitter to the Queen,\r\nwhen, in her own interest as well as in his, she felt bound to advise her\r\ncousin to resign. I was in the House of Commons at the time and heard\r\nthe War Secretary’s speech. It was fulsome and disingenuous. It did not\r\nring true. When he spoke about his “emotion” the House felt that it was\r\nfudge. If the changes which were proposed were necessary, and involved\r\nthe abolition of the Duke’s office, it would have been honest to say so,\r\ninstead of keeping up the farce that “The Duke makes way in order that\r\ncertain changes may be introduced.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s activities in other spheres, especially in all charitable\r\nendeavours, did not cease with his retirement from the Army, in which,\r\nfrom the outside, he continued to take the deepest interest. He was\r\nstrong enough in 1901 to ride at Queen Victoria’s funeral, though he\r\nwas then eighty-two years old; three years later, on the 17th of March,\r\nhe died. He was a warm-hearted man, and a most faithful friend, honest,\r\nupright, and true in every relation of life.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge’s affectionate nature was shown in the deep\r\nattachment which existed between him and his mother. Never were mother\r\nand son in more complete sympathy. The Duchess, indeed, was one of\r\nthose exceptional people who have the gift of winning hearts. During\r\nthe years when she and Princess Mary—before her marriage to the Duke of\r\nTeck—were the only members of the Royal Family who were seen in general\r\nsociety, their presence always gave pleasure. They were so gracious and\r\nso unaffectedly gratified by any attempt to entertain them. Those who\r\nsaw Princess Mary sail up the aisle of St. George’s Chapel at a royal\r\nwedding, looking as if the regal dignity of a hundred kings had been\r\nconcentrated in her, will never forget it. The Garter Standards seemed to\r\nbow and do homage to her.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess’ receptions at St. James’s Palace in what is now York House,\r\nand at Cambridge Cottage, were delightful. At Kew they often took\r\nthe shape of a dinner, followed by a little dance. I remember a very\r\ndroll incident at one of her parties at St. James’s Palace at which\r\nthe future King of Greece, then a midshipman in the Danish Navy, was\r\npresent. Levassor, the greatest of all _amuseurs_, had been engaged\r\nand was singing his very best. “Titi à la représentation de Robert le\r\nDiable,” the drollest sketch of a Parisian street-arab at the opera,\r\nand what he thought of it, was perhaps his masterpiece. When he came to\r\nthe third act, after an imitation of the famous trombone introduction\r\nhe said “On annonce”—at that very moment, from down below, there came a\r\nloud, cockneyfied voice which was heard all over that small house: “The\r\nLord Mayor’s carriage stops the way!” It was excruciatingly funny, the\r\nlaughter was electric, and Levassor was bound to admit afterwards that he\r\nhad been beaten in his own special vocation by a London footman.\r\n\r\nI feel inclined to add one word about the Duke’s father, whom I remember\r\ncoming down to Eton as an old man when I was a very small boy. He\r\nattended Chapel, so I heard him give his famous, loud-voiced response\r\nwhen the officiating clergyman said, “Let us pray,” and he piously and\r\nfervently ejaculated, “With all my heart!” After Chapel he went into\r\nthe playing-fields to see a cricket match in Upper Club, but broke away\r\nfrom the big-wigs as soon as he could and made me pilot him. I never saw\r\nhim again, for he died in 1850. He was the only one of King George the\r\nThird’s sons whom I ever saw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had held the office of Secretary for twelve years. When I was first\r\nappointed Mr. Disraeli gave me to understand that the department was in a\r\nmost unsatisfactory state. Mr. Corry, his private secretary, told me that\r\n“the Chief” said “the place was an Augean stable and must be swept out.”\r\nI was to evolve kosmos out of chaos, and chaos it certainly was. I was at\r\nonce opposed tooth and nail by Lord Henry Lennox backed by the solicitor\r\nto the department and the director of works, an engineer officer. The\r\nposition became untenable, and I wrote to the Prime Minister telling him\r\nthat in view of this obstruction it was not possible for me to carry out\r\nhis instructions, and so I put my resignation in his hands. The result\r\nwas the appointment of a Committee of the Cabinet of which the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer was Chairman and which included, among others, Lord\r\nJohn Manners, a former First Commissioner. The Committee fully justified\r\nme, and when I produced my scheme it was accepted in its entirety by a\r\nDepartmental Committee of which Sir William Stephenson was Chairman.\r\n\r\nIt is no use going into the details of old official squabbles, however\r\ntroublesome they may have been at the time. They are only worth\r\nmentioning as a proof of the generous way in which Lord Beaconsfield\r\nalways supported his subordinates—if they were in the right—even at\r\ninconvenience to himself from a political point of view; and in this\r\ncase it put him in a great difficulty on account of Lord Henry Lennox’s\r\nposition and family. However, the Duke of Richmond, meeting my father,\r\nsaid: “I hope you do not think that I am supporting the attack upon your\r\nson”—so all was well.\r\n\r\nWhen once I got into harness I felt that no man could have more congenial\r\nwork. It was all the more interesting from the fact that there was a\r\ngood deal of leeway to make up. It had been a tradition of the Office,\r\nas one of the senior clerks told me, that the Secretary should never\r\ngo and see anything, because if he did he would not be in such a good\r\nposition to say “No.” I felt that such an attitude would certainly not\r\nbe one that I could adopt. Saying “No” is one of the chief difficulties\r\nof the Secretary’s position, and it is one which often needs the use of\r\nconsiderable tact, especially when he is dealing with the mightiest in\r\nthe land, for the “accounting officer” can only work within the four\r\nvery tight corners of the Parliamentary votes; on the other hand I felt\r\nthat it was his duty to ascertain beforehand what was really needful and\r\nwhat was likely to be asked for and this could only be done by careful\r\npersonal inspection. If the request was right and reasonable it could be\r\nprovided for in the coming estimates; if not the “No” could be said with\r\neffective knowledge and without giving offence.\r\n\r\nApart from private requisitions, which are always difficult to deal with,\r\nthere were a great many old historical buildings which were showing\r\nunmistakable signs of decay. Of Hampton Court, for instance, it is\r\nhardly an exaggeration to say that in many places it was crumbling away.\r\nMost of “the King’s beasts” had toppled over from the roof of the great\r\nhall. Large patches of brickwork were literally rotting away. In the\r\ncloisters, the old brick walls were smothered with plaster, black with\r\nage, and covered with a whole pencil network of ignoble names. There was\r\nno fire brigade; should a fire occur the building was at the mercy of\r\nthe flames until some assistance could be procured from outside. During\r\nthe interregnum between the resignation of Lord Henry Lennox and the\r\nappointment of Mr. Noel I went to Mr. W. H. Smith, who was then Secretary\r\nto the Treasury, and always most sympathetic and liberal in dealing\r\nwith any question which I took to him, and put before him the piteous\r\ncondition in which this great and beautiful historic monument then\r\nwas. He saw the importance of the thing and the result was that a fire\r\nbrigade was formed, manned by the employés in the Palace, and Mr. Smith\r\nacceded to my request for an annual sum of £500 to be included in the\r\nestimate for such work of restoration, and what might almost be called\r\npatch-work, as might be necessary.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what the present fire arrangements are; they have probably\r\nbeen greatly improved since my time, but even with such appliances as we\r\nhad, three small outbreaks of fire were at once got under control, and,\r\nas everybody knows, in a case of fire it is the first five minutes that\r\nare of importance. With the £500 a year, an allowance which I believe is\r\nstill continued, the grand old buildings were gradually put into decent\r\ncondition and so they will be maintained. Mr. Ernest Law, antiquary and\r\nwriter on art, whose books on Hampton Court are the authority, was always\r\nready to put his knowledge at the service of the Office, and I had at my\r\nright hand, in Mr. Lessels, the architect in charge of the Palace, a man\r\nwho really delighted in his work. So long as Mr. Law lives the public may\r\nrest assured that a jealous eye will watch over the welfare of Cardinal\r\nWolsey’s magnificent structure, which has been his dearly-loved home from\r\nboyhood and the romantic beauties of which probably sowed the first seeds\r\nof art in his brain.\r\n\r\nGreat works of restoration were carried out at Windsor Castle, and at the\r\nTower of London and amongst the other great historic monuments. Of the\r\nworks at the Tower I have given some account in my “Tragedy in Stone.”\r\nThere was also much to be done in Scotland. But on all this I need not\r\ndwell here.\r\n\r\nOne part of my duties was a real delight to me. The care of the Royal\r\nParks became a passion, and successive First Commissioners very kindly\r\ngave me a free hand in dealing with work in which they knew that I took\r\nthe greatest interest. The flower gardening in Hyde Park had been begun\r\nmany years before by Mr. Cowper Temple when he was First Commissioner,\r\nand had been continued down to my time. But it was a very elementary\r\naffair. The trees and shrubs moreover had been totally neglected. The\r\ntrees, surely a most important consideration in any park, were crowded\r\nand killing one another. No new varieties had been introduced. The\r\nshrubs, old-fashioned lilacs, privets, ancubas and the like, had grown\r\nlanky, leggy, and hardly capable of flowering. St. James’s Park in\r\nespecial was in a most degraded condition. Battersea Park, where the\r\nsuperintendent had made a small sub-tropical garden, was the best tended\r\nof the Parks; but even there I found room for much improvement.\r\n\r\nIn short I endeavoured more or less to remodel all the Parks, and I\r\nthink the public was generally pleased with the work that was done. Two\r\nimprovements which have certainly given pleasure are the rhododendron\r\ngarden on both sides of Rotten Row and the Dell at the east end of the\r\nSerpentine.\r\n\r\nWhen I took over the care of Hyde Park the place where the Dell now\r\nis was a shrubbery with open hurdles which was the lair of all the\r\nnightbirds and undesirables who haunted the Park after dark. They slept\r\nunder the bushes and every morning a gang of men had to clear away a mass\r\nof filth indescribable. I determined to do away with this scandal. I put\r\nup an unclimbable fence, laid the place out as a sub-tropical garden with\r\npalms, tree-ferns, dracænas and other beauties, planted the little stream\r\nwith water-lilies, royal fern and so forth, and made it from an eyesore\r\nand a den of horrors into what it now is.\r\n\r\nFor that some years afterwards, long after I had left the Office of\r\nWorks, I earned a piece of praise which gave me intense pleasure.\r\nOne Sunday I saw quite a number of people looking at the Dell. I\r\ntoo was moved to go and see. Up came a couple of young guardsmen,\r\nnon-commissioned officers. They stood for a few moments and as they\r\nwalked away one of them said, “What’s the use of going abroad when we’ve\r\ngot such a thing as that here in London?” I never felt so flattered.\r\n\r\nTo the Queen and to the Duke of St. Albans as Lord Grand Falconer was\r\nconfined the privilege of driving in Rotten Row. The last time that I saw\r\nthe Queen drive there was once when she came up from Windsor to see my\r\nnewly-planted rhododendron garden. She was very much pleased, and I had\r\na letter from Sir Henry Ponsonby to say so. At one time the Duke of St.\r\nAlbans used to drive along Rotten Row once a year in order to keep up the\r\nprivilege, but whether that is continued now I know not.\r\n\r\nThere was one interesting piece of work outside the normal duties of\r\nmy office in which I was concerned. It was a graceful idea of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s to commemorate his victory in the famous Midlothian Campaign\r\nof 1880 by some sort of monument in Edinburgh. It occurred to him that\r\nit would be an appropriate gift if he were to reproduce the old City\r\nCross, the “Mercat” Cross as it was called, which used to stand in the\r\nHigh Street and from which the Royal proclamations used to be heralded.\r\nIt was from that Cross that Prince Charles Edward, the young Pretender,\r\nwas proclaimed King of England and Scotland in 1745. It was swept away\r\nin 1756 as an obstruction, an act of vandalism which Sir Walter Scott\r\nscourged in “Marmion.” It had been an octagonal tower surmounted by a\r\nshaft carrying a unicorn which had been destroyed by Cromwell. The shaft\r\nhad been removed to Drum, near Dalkeith. Mr. Gladstone was very keen upon\r\nrebuilding the little tower outside St. Giles’s Cathedral, and replacing\r\nthe shaft, which was to be brought back from Drum.\r\n\r\nHe asked me to help him in the business part of his undertaking, which\r\nI was only too glad to do. On the recommendation of Lord Rosebery, Mr.\r\nSydney Mitchell, a Scot, was chosen to be the architect. I had a good\r\ndeal of correspondence with Mr. Gladstone upon the subject, for he was a\r\nsedulous letter-writer. People at that time had not yet fallen into the\r\nlazy habit of using typewriters; all his letters were holograph in his\r\nown hand, and some of them very long. The modern fashion would have been\r\nquite out of tune with his exquisite old world courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Bath, who, though a Tory, was one of his great admirers,\r\nsaid to me once that Mr. Gladstone’s punctilious politeness always made\r\nhim feel shy. “He will take off his hat!” How he found time for writing\r\nis a mystery. Upon one detail he was much exercised. He had discovered,\r\nhow I know not, that Sir Walter Scott had managed to obtain some of\r\nthe stones of the old Mercat Cross, and used them in building the\r\nwalls at Abbotsford. He was very keen to gain possession of these and\r\nto incorporate them in the new Cross. To his great disappointment Sir\r\nWalter’s successor refused his request. He wrote to me at great length\r\nand almost indignantly upon the subject, but I felt bound to say that\r\nI thought that it was intelligible that the present possessors should\r\ndecline to tamper with Sir Walter’s building, indeed, that they might\r\nalmost consider that it would be an act of impiety to do so. However, in\r\nthe end the finished work gave Mr. Gladstone as great pleasure as it did\r\nto the citizens of Edinburgh. The Latin inscription was composed by Mr.\r\nGladstone, rather against his will, in deference to a general wish that\r\nthere should be an inscription of some sort. He wrote and consulted me\r\nupon the subject. With Dr. Johnson’s views in my head, I suggested that\r\nit should be in Latin. Mr. Gladstone wrote back:\r\n\r\n                                   “Hawarden Castle, Nov. 7th, 1885.\r\n\r\n    “The idea of a Latin inscription crossing my mind amidst\r\n    the perplexities of the stories about disestablishment[45]\r\n    disturbed me much. Why should there be an inscription beyond\r\n    the date of the re-erection? I quite agree that whatever there\r\n    is should be in Latin. It might be put on at a later date as\r\n    well as now. There is certainly the gallant malediction of\r\n    Scott to commemorate; but I should be glad to know what has\r\n    passed through your mind as to the substance before considering\r\n    the form.\r\n\r\n    “I go to Dalmeny on Monday and we will consider about a day for\r\n    the opening.”\r\n\r\nThe new Cross was finished in 1885, and dedicated in November of that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone then wrote to me:\r\n\r\n                               “10, Downing Street, Feb. 12th, 1886.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MR. MITFORD,\r\n\r\n    “I send the draft for the balance due on account of the Mercat\r\n    Cross, and have in addition only to repeat my thanks to you\r\n    personally for your most efficient aid and to express my\r\n    satisfaction with the manner in which this high class work has\r\n    been executed.\r\n\r\n    “I will write to Mr. Mitchell.\r\n\r\n                        “Yours most faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                       (_Signed_) “W. E. GLADSTONE.”\r\n\r\nThe last time that I saw Mr. Gladstone to speak to was on a fine summer’s\r\nday in 1886. I had gone over to Downing Street to see his private\r\nsecretary, Mr. (now Sir Henry) Primrose on business connected with my\r\nresignation. When we had finished our talk he said that he was sure\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone would like to see me. The great Prime Minister was\r\nsitting in the little garden reading, but got up and bade me welcome\r\nwith all the gracious courtesy which distinguished him. He was most kind\r\nand sympathetic, talking much of Lord Redesdale, whose page he had been\r\nat the Eton Montem when my cousin was in Sixth form and he a lower boy.\r\nMany a time and oft did I listen to his speeches in aftertimes, sitting\r\nopposite to him in the House of Commons, but never again did I hear his\r\nvoice in the privacy of personal conversation. He was one of those great\r\nmen whom to have known is a valuable privilege.\r\n\r\nIf I have dwelt longer on the story of the Mercat Cross than the subject\r\nitself might justly warrant, it must be ascribed to that pride which the\r\ndwarf of our childhood’s tales felt when he marched out to war side by\r\nside with the giant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nBATSFORD, AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI was now a free man, and after a trip of a month in France I sold my\r\nLondon house, took possession of Batsford and made up my mind to become a\r\ncountry squire. I was made a magistrate and a Deputy Lieutenant, attended\r\nPetty and Quarter Sessions and interested myself in agricultural matters.\r\nIn short, I tried to learn my business. I did not go about, as one of\r\nmy neighbours did, with a sample of wheat in my breeches pocket; but\r\nlandlording having become at that moment a poor trade, fast travelling\r\non its way to that bottom which it touched a year or two later, and from\r\nwhich it has now mercifully in a great measure recovered, I was anxious\r\nto see whether something could not be done to relieve the distress under\r\nwhich the farmers with wheat at less than twenty shillings a quarter were\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I met one of my tenants, a most capable man for whom I\r\nsoon grew to entertain a great respect, and joining company with him\r\nbegan to talk over matters. He suggested to me that nothing would be of\r\nsuch benefit to the farmers in the neighbourhood as having a high class,\r\nsound shire stallion. He said, and indeed I had myself noticed, that\r\nthere was not a decent cart-horse in the whole country-side. The land, he\r\npointed out, was excellently adapted for horse-breeding, good pasture,\r\nwith plenty of lime in the water to make bone, and he felt certain that\r\nwithin a few years a good trade in cart-horses might be got up. I jumped\r\nat the idea. I had always been a great admirer of a good cart-horse, my\r\nfancy being largely stimulated by the dash and vigour of Rosa Bonheur’s\r\n“Horse Fair,” which, if it does not satisfy the judges of horses in\r\nall respects, has yet the living spark of genius which belongs to a\r\nfine poem; her famous roan horse must have been inspired by the noble\r\ndescription in the Book of Job, which is far more a prophecy of the\r\nshire, pawing in the valley and rejoicing in his strength, than of the\r\nlordly thoroughbred. It was such horses as these that carried the mailed\r\nknights—Richard Cœur de Lion and Front de Bœuf—into the lists of chivalry\r\nat Ashby-de-la-Zouch—horses bred by the union of the old “great horse”\r\nof Britain with the mares of Flanders. That great horse had qualities\r\nwhich attracted the notice of Julius Cæsar. It astonished him to see a\r\nhorse strong enough, when forced back upon his haunches, to hold up a\r\nwar chariot going down hill; and when we think of what a clumsy affair a\r\nwar chariot must have been, carrying besides the charioteer at least one\r\nheavily armed man, perhaps more, we cease to wonder at Cæsar’s admiration\r\nof an animal that was new to him.\r\n\r\nAs a Londoner I had been greatly fascinated by the proud teams of some\r\nof the great brewers, horsed by the progeny of the sires owned by such\r\nmen as the late Lord Ellesmere, Lord Wantage, Mr. Edward Coke, Sir Walter\r\nGilbey and others. I told my farmer friend that I had seen that Mr. Coke\r\nwas going to have a sale at Longford, in Derbyshire, and knowing him to\r\nbe a fine judge of horseflesh, promised that if he would go with me, I\r\nwould try and obtain a horse. He was delighted, and agreed to help me.\r\n\r\nWe went and looked over the stallions, but there was not one that quite\r\nsatisfied my friend’s critical eye. We went round the stalls with my old\r\nschoolfellow Reggie Buller, a colonel in the Grenadier Guards (famous as\r\nthe first boy who introduced a cutaway coat in place of the old “tails”\r\nat Eton), who was a sort of uncle to Mr. Coke’s stud. Rather nettled\r\nat our not seeming to fall down and worship he turned to my friend and\r\nsaid, “You must have some very good horses in your neighbourhood if none\r\nof these please you.” “No,” was the answer, “we have nothing but rotten\r\nones, and that’s what makes me such a good judge of a bad horse!”\r\n\r\nWell, we failed to buy a stallion, but presently the auctioneer got into\r\nhis rostrum, and I, as always is the case with me, got intoxicated with\r\nthe excitement, and having come to the conclusion, not without reason,\r\nthat a horse would never make his reputation unless he had a few really\r\nfirst-rate mares by means of which to advertise his stock, determined to\r\nlay the foundation of a stud of my own by buying Chance, who was said to\r\nbe the best Shire Mare that ever was foaled. I had no reason to regret\r\nthe purchase, for she had never been beaten in the past from the day when\r\nshe was champion foal, and was destined never to be beaten in the future.\r\nShe won every prize for me, including the special gold medal given by\r\nQueen Victoria to commemorate her Presidentship of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety at its Jubilee Show at Windsor in 1889. It may be interesting\r\nhereafter to note the price, 520 guineas. Prices have gone up since then.\r\nI wonder what such a mare would be worth to-day.\r\n\r\nAs visitors at hotels are known by the numbers of their rooms and not by\r\ntheir names, so I became known in the agricultural world as the possessor\r\nof the famous mare. More than once at shows I heard the question and\r\nanswer, “Who’s that man?” “Why, don’t you know him? He’s the owner of\r\nChance.” Later on I bought two grand horses, Hitchin Conqueror, who was\r\nchampion, and Laughingstock, reserve for champion, at the Shire Horse\r\nShow at Islington, and was the first man to win a championship there with\r\nan animal of his own breeding; which I did with a beautiful mare called\r\nMinnehaha, a daughter of Laughingstock; but she, poor thing, caught\r\na cold at the Agricultural Hall and died of pneumonia. Her death was\r\nthe beginning of a long run of bad luck after a course of immense good\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nBut what pleased me most in my success was that it enabled me to start a\r\nShire Horse Show at Moreton-in-Marsh. The consequence was that in a few\r\nyears’ time the farmers round about me were able to show a grand lot of\r\ncart horses, and my triumph was complete when one of them sold a gelding\r\nto the agent of one of the railway companies for a hundred guineas. Those\r\nwho bred from pedigree mares made fancy prices for their foals, and the\r\nneighbourhood became famous among breeders and dealers as a horse centre.\r\n\r\nFor the last quarter of a century and more I have been much mixed\r\nup with the horse world. For many years I was on the Council of the\r\nLondon Shire Horse Society and was finally elected President. With the\r\nInternational Horse Show at Olympia I have been connected from the\r\nbeginning—first as judge and afterwards as director. With Lord Lonsdale\r\nas our President I think we may claim to have done something towards\r\nkeeping up horse-breeding at a moment when motor traction had dealt it a\r\nheavy blow; nor is that all.\r\n\r\nInternational competition has taught our people that we are not the only\r\nheirs of the centaurs, and has stimulated our army riders especially to\r\nnew endeavours. When I was a boy it used to be the fashion to laugh at\r\nthe idea that any foreigner could ride. We know better now. The French,\r\nthe Belgian, the Italian and the Russian cavalry-men are all magnificent\r\nhorsemen, and at first absolutely beat our men out of the field at show\r\nwork. But the lesson has been taken to heart, and with practice and\r\na little encouragement from the War Office, our officers have shown\r\nthat they can hold their own against all comers. But to produce such\r\nperfect machinery as is turned out by the school at Saumur for instance,\r\nneeds backing from above. I went last year (1914) at the invitation of\r\nthe Société Hippique to see the Saumur men ride—a piece of absolute\r\nperfection as illustrating the _entente cordiale_ between rider and\r\nmount, the brain and will-power of the man commanding the movement of\r\nevery muscle of the horse.\r\n\r\nIn breeding I did not confine myself to Shires. I inherited a famous old\r\nthoroughbred stallion called Arbitrator, that Admiral Rous pronounced to\r\nbe the best model of a steeplechaser that he ever saw. He was the sire\r\nof a good many capital hunters and carriage horses. I also bred Hackneys\r\nfor a few years, but they were not a success, though to head the stud I\r\nbought a son of Sir Walter Gilbey’s famous horse Danegelt.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have seen something of country life before the old system\r\nof County Management had been abolished by the introduction of County\r\nCouncils, which have swallowed all the duties of Quarter Sessions save\r\nonly their judicial functions. In Gloucestershire, under the chairmanship\r\nof Sir John Dorington, one of the ablest and most conscientious of\r\nadministrators, whose worth was afterwards acknowledged by his election\r\nto the chair of the County Council, the magistrates certainly did their\r\nwork admirably. Having had a pretty long experience of the civil service,\r\nworking under the stern and sometimes rather narrow rule of the Treasury,\r\nI was perhaps a more or less competent critic, and I must say that I was\r\nfull of admiration for the way in which the business of the county was\r\ncarried on. The County Council has larger duties to perform, and very\r\nwell its work is done; it is, moreover, a tribute to the efficiency of\r\nthe squirearchy that it is so largely represented in a body which is none\r\nthe worse for a leaven of the farmer and labour classes.\r\n\r\nThe quarterly meetings of the magistrates, which lasted for one, two\r\nor three days, were useful and pleasant gatherings. We put up at the\r\nJudges’ lodgings at Gloucester, and had the opportunity of discussing\r\nbusiness and comparing notes with men from distant parts of the county.\r\nThe loss of those meetings was an incident of the change which I greatly\r\nregretted. Quarter Sessions were of the nature of a very pleasant club\r\nat which, in addition to the transaction of business, there was all the\r\ncharm of a delightful social gathering. The motor car, which has made\r\nsuch a revolution in country life, has also borne a hand in the abolition\r\nof our agreeable symposia. There are few places so remote that it is\r\nnecessary to sleep out when you can travel to your County Hall at the\r\nrate of twenty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe men who habitually attended Quarter Sessions were all of them able\r\nmen, cultivated and well read. One dear man, now long since departed,\r\nwas a little too well read. He was very proud of his scholarship and\r\nespecially of his knowledge of Cicero—the one classic bore whom, above\r\nall others, I disliked. One night I had gone to bed with a bad headache,\r\nand unable to dine. My friend came to my room after dinner, full of\r\nsympathy. He sat down on my bed and quoted Cicero for an hour or more.\r\nThere was no escape. I lay there and listened in silent patience to\r\nexcerpts from the treatise “De Amicitia,” wishing that it had never been\r\nwritten, or at any rate that Amicitia would prompt my persecutor to leave\r\nme to bear the throbbings of my head in peaceful solitude.\r\n\r\nThe years of my life have been years of transition in many countries.\r\nIt would have been strange if my own country had been exempt; but I am\r\nold-fashioned enough and conservative enough to regret many changes, and\r\nmany losses; not the least of these regrets is given to the old Quarter\r\nSessions.\r\n\r\nHardly had I settled down at Batsford when the defeat of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nGovernment was followed by a general election. Lord Hertford, who was\r\npresident of the South-West Warwickshire Conservative Association, called\r\non me and asked me to stand for the Stratford-on-Avon Division. I did not\r\nsee my way to complying at that moment. Although I should have had little\r\nhesitation in standing for a borough, I felt that I did not know enough\r\nabout country life and the requirements of farmers and labourers to\r\nface the ordeal of a contest in an agricultural constituency. It seemed\r\nto me that I should be about the worst candidate that could be chosen.\r\nLord Hertford tried hard to persuade me, but I was obstinate, and I did\r\nwell, for an excellent Conservative candidate was found in Mr. Townsend\r\nof Honington Hall, near Stratford, a very accomplished and very popular\r\nman who won the election. He knew his lesson and I did not. I might, and\r\nprobably should, have made every sort of blunder.\r\n\r\nThe next few years were peaceful and uneventful. I was occupied with\r\nall those interests which made a country gentleman’s life so full of\r\ninterest. We seldom went to London, and then only for a few days at a\r\ntime, but in 1889 I bought a yacht and was elected to the Royal Yacht\r\nSquadron. That was a great pleasure and forged a new link with the outer\r\nworld, from which we had more or less cut ourselves adrift.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 there was again a general election, and this time Mr. Townsend\r\ndid not wish to stand again. He was a most conscientious member, never\r\nsparing himself, and his health was beginning to give way under the\r\nfatigue of the House of Commons. Once more Lord Hertford appealed to me.\r\nHe wrote to me, begging me to defend the seat, but adding very honestly\r\nthat it was a forlorn hope, as the opposite side had secured as their\r\ncandidate Mr. Fell, a prominent local contractor and great employer of\r\nlabour who would most probably win; at any rate, his popularity would\r\nmake him a very powerful enemy. This time I could hardly refuse, so I\r\nwent into harness at once and held my first meeting at Stratford itself.\r\n\r\nWe made a strong show, for the Liberal Unionists, led by Mr. Charles\r\nand Mr. Edgar Flower, had accepted me wholeheartedly, and gave me very\r\nzealous support. The opening of the campaign was full of good augury.\r\nBut I was certainly lucky. A few days later the dreaded Mr. Fell, for\r\nprivate reasons, retired from the contest, and the Radical party had to\r\nlook about for a new candidate. Their choice fell upon Mr. Warmington,\r\nan outsider, and I felt that, however able he might be, I should still\r\nhave a certain advantage over a carpet-bagger. And so it turned out.\r\nI won with a majority of more than seven hundred. It was not an easy\r\nconstituency to contest. The distances were very great. Railways gave\r\nlittle help, and motors had not yet sprung into existence. It was very\r\nhard work, but my friends were very kind, especially the Flowers, and\r\nthey lightened the burden as much as possible.\r\n\r\nI look back upon that election with much pleasure, in spite of its\r\nfatigue, as a time full of happy memories. Of these none is happier\r\nthan the thought of the relations between my opponent and myself. Mr.\r\nWarmington proved to be the most courteous and kindly of men; and I don’t\r\nthink that throughout the fight, which was pretty rough, there was an\r\nangry or even unfriendly word uttered by either of us. Our supporters\r\nwere not so discreet, and there were one or two meetings which were\r\ndistinctly unpleasant.\r\n\r\nParliament met on the 4th of August, and on the 11th Lord Salisbury’s\r\nGovernment was turned out by a vote of want of confidence, led by Mr.\r\nAsquith. It was a most telling speech, for Mr. Asquith is a lord of\r\nlanguage. But then, it is easy to preach to the converted. I have often\r\nheard it discussed whether a speech in the House of Commons ever turned\r\na vote. The question was once put to Lord John Russell. He was equal to\r\nthe occasion. Just as Mother Eve, according to Milton, was “the fairest\r\nof her daughters,” so Lord John was the most convinced of his own\r\nsupporters. He did not hesitate. “Yes,” he answered. “My great speech in\r\n1832 is known to have turned eighteen votes.”\r\n\r\nMy three years as a member of the House of Commons were passed in what\r\nhas been called the cold shades of Opposition. But those shades, chilly\r\nas they may be to the leaders, are warmth itself for the rank and file of\r\nthe party. When the sun is shining, speech is the exclusive privilege of\r\nthe front bench. The private member may not utter lest he encounter the\r\nsteely glance of the Chief Whip and the bored inattention of Ministers.\r\nDuring an eclipse he may deliver pin-pricks as he chooses, and the\r\nsharper their points are the better the leaders are pleased. But when the\r\nlight begins to blaze again, let not the poor little member think that\r\nhe has earned the right of speech. If he has the misfortune to catch the\r\nSpeaker’s eye, then he will learn to appreciate the arctic powers of a\r\nMinisterial frost.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the House of Commons Lord Randolph Churchill said to me,\r\n“You have come to the dullest place on earth, with great compensations.”\r\nLord Randolph was right. Except on field days, when there was a “full\r\ndress” debate, the House of Commons was a terribly “dull place” and the\r\ncompensations, like the rewards of virtue, were slow in coming. For three\r\nyears we streeled through the Division lobbies, sometimes sitting up all\r\nnight, only to see the mystic piece of paper containing the numbers of\r\nthe division turned over to the Government Whip, while our own shepherd,\r\nAkers-Douglas, now Lord Chilston, whom we all loved, had to stand by\r\nhim, empty-handed, but with great dignity preserving an equal mind in\r\narduous circumstances. Of the pin-pricks of which I spoke there was no\r\nlack. On the bench immediately behind the seats of the mighty there sat\r\nnear me Hanbury, afterwards Secretary to the Treasury and Minister of\r\nAgriculture, and Bowles, both sharp thorns in the side of the Government;\r\nthe latter producing damaging facts as a conjuror brings toys and flowers\r\nout of his hat; but what are damaging facts worth when set before a deaf\r\nadder that stoppeth her ear? And what adder is so deaf as the Government\r\nparty in the House; the party which never forgets the chances of some\r\nbenefit from the distributors of loaves and fishes? Now it is worse\r\nthan ever. There is the salary. Men think twice before turning out a\r\nGovernment, which means a dissolution, and the loss of £400 a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, who, eighteen years earlier, had given out that he felt\r\nhimself to be too old to remain actively engaged in public life, now, at\r\nthe age of eighty-two, entered the lists once more as Prime Minister,\r\nand as full of fight as ever, carrying mainly upon his own shoulders,\r\nbut splendidly seconded by Mr. John Morley, the whole weight of the\r\nHome Rule Bill, upon the passing of which he had set his heart. It was\r\nupon a titanic undertaking that he entered, in spite of his years; a\r\nreally superb effort; for this was to be no humdrum Parliament for the\r\ndiscussion of petty questions of fiscal or parochial interests.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a tussle of giants, and Mr. Gladstone knew it. Yet he did\r\nnot flinch from it, and his vigorous courage compelled the admiration of\r\nall of us, foes as well as friends. There came a moment when he felt that\r\nhe must husband his strength, and so one fine day we were informed that\r\nMr. Gladstone would, from that time forth, only lead the House up to the\r\ndinner hour, after which time Sir William Harcourt would be in command.\r\nThis led to quite the wittiest thing—given all the circumstances—that was\r\nsaid during that Parliament. On hearing the announcement, Mr. Darling\r\n(now Mr. Justice Darling) got up and said, “Are we to infer, then, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, that after to-day there will be a greater light to rule the day\r\nand a lesser light to rule the night?” There was a roar of laughter.\r\nThere was no great love between Mr. Darling and Sir William Harcourt,\r\nand the interjection was a hit, a very palpable hit. Sir William, in\r\nhis stately way, frowned an Olympian frown, but reserved his fire for a\r\nfuture occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was naturally upon the Home Rule Bill that the energies of the great\r\nmen on both sides were concentrated. Mr. Gladstone’s difficulties\r\nwere colossal; it was at one time doubtful whether he could count on\r\nthe whole-hearted support of all his partisans in regard to some of\r\nthe provisions of his measure. It was even whispered that his chief\r\nlieutenant, Mr. Morley, had been on the point of cutting the painter upon\r\nthe question of its finance. But however that may have been, the appeals\r\nto their loyalty that he made were successful, and he was saved from the\r\nposition of having to stand isolated like a rock attacked on all sides by\r\nthe Biscayan buffets of the waves of opposition. What remained to him of\r\nhis forces after 1886 rallied round him as a united party.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no measure was more violently fought over in the whole history of\r\nthe British Parliament; on one occasion, in July, 1894, it ended in what\r\nvery nearly became a free fight in Committee. It was said that Colonel\r\nSaunderson even struck a blow. I can certify that there was no truth in\r\nthat, for I was actually standing next to him, sleeve to sleeve; his\r\narm with his fist clenched was held out straight in front of him, but\r\nthere was no blow struck. The riot was furious and disgraceful enough\r\nwithout any exaggeration; Mr. Ashmead Bartlett theatrically shook his\r\nfist across the House at Mr. Gladstone, shouting: “This is your doing,\r\nSir.” The Speaker was sent for, and never shall I forget the effect of\r\nthe appearance of that majestic presence. Mr. Peel entered solemn and\r\ndignified, above all as calm and emotionless as a statue. His pale, noble\r\nfeatures might have been carved in ivory. In an instant the turbulent,\r\nnoisy mob of legislators was quelled like a parcel of naughty schoolboys\r\nby the mere sight of the Head Master. Mr. Peel’s command of the House was\r\nmagnetic, and he could cow the most unruly. I doubt whether any other man\r\ncould have exercised the same silent power that he did at that difficult\r\nand trying moment. He was the embodiment of the old Roman poet’s idea:\r\n“Vir pietate gravis.”\r\n\r\nIn the Home Rule debates Mr. Gladstone had to deal with formidable\r\nadversaries, men proof against all the magic of his great eloquence,\r\nand who never missed a chance of proving the joints in his armour. Mr.\r\nBalfour’s speeches were superb. He was not only gifted with the power of\r\nwords, but he was possessed of a consummate knowledge of the subject, a\r\nknowledge acquired during the time when, as Chief Secretary for Ireland,\r\nhe had by travel and personal investigation made himself master of every\r\ndetail in connection with the distressful country. All the floods of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s eloquence passed over him, leaving him high and dry. There\r\nwas no drowning him.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain, too, was a giant in debate, certainly the greatest\r\ndebater that I ever knew. His speeches were magnificent and full of that\r\nmysterious power over an audience which is one of the rarest of faculties\r\ngiven to a statesman; but when it came to the shorter discussion in\r\nCommittee, there he was absolutely matchless. No matter what card might\r\nbe played against him he always seemed to have the ace of trumps up his\r\nsleeve. Never was this better exemplified than in the debate of July 3rd,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nMr. John Dillon, member for East Mayo, had been accused by Mr.\r\nChamberlain of making a firebrand speech inciting to murder. Mr. Dillon\r\ncould not deny the accuracy of the charge, but he justified himself by\r\nsaying (I am quoting from Hansard): “The speech was delivered in 1886, a\r\nshort time after the massacre of Mitchelstown, where he had seen before\r\nhis own eyes three innocent men shot down—and shot down in cold blood,\r\nby policemen, who were acting under the orders of an officer who was so\r\nbankrupt in character that even the Rt. Hon. gentleman (Mr. Balfour),\r\nthe Tory Chief Secretary, had dismissed him from his employment.... That\r\nofficer was charged by the jury with gross incompetency, if not worse,\r\nand of being the cause of the murders committed at Mitchelstown.... The\r\nrecollection of these events was hot in his mind when he made the speech\r\nin question, and had been for weeks and months before.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Dillon uttered these words, with all the funereal solemnity for\r\nwhich he was famous, I saw Mr. Chamberlain give some instruction to one\r\nof his faithful runners sitting near him, who presently came back with a\r\nvolume in his hand. When Mr. Dillon sat down, Mr. Chamberlain got up to\r\nreply and said:\r\n\r\n“The Committee has heard the defence of the hon. member, that he was\r\nspeaking in circumstances of such intense provocation that in fact almost\r\nany language would be justified, and that he himself was in a condition\r\nof mind in which he could hardly control himself. Why? Because the\r\nmassacre of Mitchelstown had taken place only a short time ago and he\r\nwas still thrilling with the horrors of that massacre.” (_Ministerial_\r\ncheers.) “Yes! You cheered it!” (Renewed _ministerial_ cheers.) “Do\r\nyou know the fact is that the massacre of Mitchelstown took place on\r\nSeptember 9th, 1887, and that this speech was delivered on December 5th,\r\n1886? The hon. member for East Mayo, who had more than a week to prepare\r\nhimself, and has had the facts, dates, places and everything before him,\r\nnow comes down to this House and palms off a statement of that kind.\r\nWell, sir, in these circumstances how can we accept the hon. member’s\r\ntardy repentance?”\r\n\r\nThere was naturally much laughter. Mr. Dillon looked sheepish, and the\r\nRadical party felt that their cheers had been a little premature. I was\r\ngoing to dine at the House that evening, and before dinner I went into\r\nthe lavatory to wash my hands. One man was there before me—Mr. John\r\nDillon. To him entered another Irishman, who, probably not seeing me,\r\nsaid: “Ah! John, Joe had ye that time!” “Yes,” was the answer, and then,\r\nafter a pause, “DAMN him!” Never did I hear that prayer uttered with more\r\nheartfelt fervour.\r\n\r\nI had the greatest admiration for Mr. Chamberlain. I made his\r\nacquaintance first at dinner at Sir Charles Dilke’s in 1874, and often\r\nmet him afterwards. His talk was always good to listen to: the short,\r\ncrisp, incisive sentences which were so characteristic of his public\r\nspeeches were equally attractive in private conversation, and he had a\r\nvoice which was a mine of wealth in itself. I have rarely heard a more\r\nfascinating utterance than his. The language was extraordinarily good;\r\nthere never seemed to be a syllable too much and every word told. I\r\nthought his talk more pleasing than that of John Bright—though that is\r\nsaying a great deal. But in Bright there was always a certain assumption\r\nof superior righteousness—the sort of patronizing manner that made him\r\nsay to Lord Clarendon when he was staying at The Grove: “Now this is\r\nthe sort of estate to which I do not object.” Lord Randolph Churchill\r\nonce mercilessly ridiculed the self-righteous manner of John Bright. At\r\na time when Bright had more or less retired out of the fighting line,\r\nhe interrupted Randolph in the middle of a speech. Randolph turned upon\r\nhim as if he had been suddenly awakened out of a long sleep. “The Right\r\nHonourable gentleman interrupts me—I thought that he was no longer to\r\nbe reckoned with—but let him wait! I will tear from him those robes of\r\nrighteousness in which he loves to exhibit himself to his constituents,\r\nand he shall appear before them naked and ashamed!” I am quoting from\r\nmemory, but I do not think that I am far out.\r\n\r\nChamberlain could dispute a point, and did dispute many points with many\r\nmen, and the victory in argument, at any rate, was pretty sure to be with\r\nhim, but he fought on equal terms, claiming no superior vantage-ground\r\nfrom which to attack. To me he was a wonderfully attractive personality,\r\nand when he was stricken down I felt that it was a cruel blow to the\r\nBritish Constitution. Had he been spared to us the state of home politics\r\nwould have been very different now. It was a tragedy which deprived of\r\nutterance him to whom utterance meant so much—and not to him alone.\r\n\r\nThe two Irishmen for whom I conceived the greatest respect at that time\r\nwere Mr. John Redmond and Mr. Tim Healy, though I knew neither of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Redmond was then only the leader of the Parnellite party, and he had\r\nbut the merest handful of men with him—nine in all. Time after time he\r\ngot up, practically alone, without a supporting cheer—for owing to the\r\nsplit in the Irish party the anti-Parnellites listened to him in mute\r\nneglect, and the Government party who truckled to them followed suit,\r\nwhile we were silent for another reason; yet Mr. Redmond stood there,\r\nbrave and unmoved, never allowing the studied indifference of his hearers\r\nto chill his very real eloquence. It was a great test of courage—it\r\nwas a great performance. It was in a spirit of lofty scorn that he\r\naddressed the Irishmen around him—now his devoted slaves, then his\r\nfoes—saying: “Yes! You talk of your gratitude to the living Englishman”\r\n(Gladstone)—“but who now thinks of the dead Irishman?” (Parnell). The\r\nwords and the tone were withering.\r\n\r\nHere again I am quoting from memory, and I may be wrong in a word or\r\ntwo, but I think not. He seemed to scourge the men whom he taunted with\r\ntheir ingratitude to their former chieftain. The words I have quoted are\r\nfew enough, and written they seem cold; but as he uttered them they were\r\nliquid, scorching fire, and at that moment he reached a height which he\r\nhimself probably never suspected. Parnell had never been popular with his\r\nfollowers. They recognized his power, and they knew that he was necessary\r\nto them, but their allegiance was purely one of self-interest. He was too\r\nimperious and supercilious—looking down upon them from the height of his\r\nsuperiority—to command any affection. He held himself perfectly aloof\r\nfrom them, and would not even let them know where he was living.\r\n\r\nMr. Tim Healy’s talents were of a very different order. His caustic,\r\nsardonic humour was always telling; his knowledge of the forms of the\r\nHouse—a very sharp-edged weapon—was consummate, and he was past-master\r\nof the art of interjections. When he rose in his place, even though\r\nit should be for less time than it takes to write this, it was pretty\r\ncertain that somebody would be made to wince under his biting sneers.\r\nHe could make a capital speech as occasion served him, but it was as an\r\ninterruptor that his stinging words drew blood. He was recognized as a\r\npower in the House, and a welcome tonic bracing it up in its feeblest\r\nmoments of enervation.\r\n\r\nApart from the two men that I have mentioned the Irishmen of the ’92\r\nParliament were dreary and uninteresting. The old spirit of Irish wit\r\nseemed to have died out: if it still had a spark of life in the drivers\r\nof the jaunting-cars in Dublin there was none of it at Westminster among\r\nthe dull dogs whom Ireland sent to us. Their leader, Mr. Justin McCarthy,\r\nwas an amiable man of letters, whom, I believe, everybody who knew him\r\nliked, but as a politician he was not inspiring, and the rest of the\r\nmen were long-winded bores. When they got up to speak the tea-room, the\r\nlibrary and the smoking-room rapidly filled. The message that one of the\r\n_Dî majores_ was up—Gladstone, Chamberlain, Morley, Balfour, Hicks-Beach,\r\nwas needed to charm men back to the green benches, and among our men\r\nColonel Saunderson could always draw an audience. Party considerations\r\nand not Mr. Gladstone’s eloquence carried the Bill through. Just before\r\nthe final Division I was speaking with a not very violent Liberal friend\r\nof mine, and asked him how he, with his opinions, could vote for Home\r\nRule. His answer was that he did not like it any better than I did, “But\r\nI can’t desert the old man.” Shortly afterwards he was made a Baronet! I\r\ncannot do more than record a few sketchy impressions of what took place\r\nin regard to this revolutionary measure. Its history is public property.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule Bill was passed by the House of Commons on the 1st\r\nof September, after a fight which had lasted eighty-five days. It\r\nwas promptly thrown out by the House of Lords, in which the Duke of\r\nDevonshire led the attack. After a holiday of about a month the House of\r\nCommons met again and took in hand the Parish Councils Bill, a highly\r\ncontentious measure of great importance, in which Sir Henry Fowler was\r\nthe Prime Minister’s Chief Aide-de-Camp. The Employers’ Liability Bill,\r\nin which the Government were beaten by the Lords on the question of\r\ncontracting out under certain conditions, was another Bill of great\r\nweight which had to be dealt with, and with all this burden of work to\r\ncarry Parliament continued to sit on into March, when on the 3rd it was\r\nprorogued, after a session of thirteen months—the longest on record. The\r\nrespite was but short, for the new session began only eight days later.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an event of the greatest moment had taken place. Mr.\r\nGladstone, who was now eighty-four years of age, had definitely resigned\r\nthe Premiership, and retired into private life. For some time past his\r\nears and eyes had both been failing. As he told the Queen, his hearing\r\nhad become so dull that even in the Cabinet he was no longer able to\r\nfollow the discussions of his colleagues; he was suffering from cataract,\r\nfor which he underwent a successful operation, but though he regained\r\nhis sight, he felt that his activities were spent. After his retirement\r\nthere came, from time to time, flashes of the old glory, some of which\r\nmust have startled Constantinople, from Hawarden, Chester, Liverpool;\r\na polemical discussion with the Pope on the subject of the recognition\r\nof Anglican orders, if it achieved nothing, at any rate commanded\r\nadmiration. Such meteoric apparitions were all that his countrymen were\r\nnow to know of the great political hero who was thenceforth a recluse at\r\nHawarden. The political arena had lost its greatest living athlete, the\r\nHouse of Commons saw him no more.\r\n\r\nFrom Lord Morley’s “Life of Gladstone” it is plain that the Queen, in\r\naccepting his resignation, made it clear to him that it was not her\r\nintention to consult him as to her choice of his successor. Had she done\r\nso he would have recommended Lord Spencer. In the House of Commons the\r\ngeneral feeling had been that if Mr. Gladstone retired, which was fully\r\nexpected, his mantle would fall upon Sir William Harcourt. As to what\r\nactually took place that day at Windsor there were many wild stories\r\nfloating about. Some wise men said that Mr. Gladstone had suggested Lord\r\nRosebery’s name to the Queen—that we know was absolutely untrue; another\r\nstory was to the effect that Sir Henry Ponsonby was so sure of Her\r\nMajesty’s intentions that he actually summoned Sir William Harcourt to\r\nbe in attendance. Probably another lie. When the moment came the Queen,\r\nacting upon her own responsibility and initiative, upon which in the\r\nchoice of a Prime Minister she always insisted, sent for Lord Rosebery.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone died in 1898. Of those who play a conspicuous part, even\r\na noble part, in the history of their day, it is strange how very\r\nfew survive their own death. During a life-time which has now lasted\r\nperilously near to eighty years I can recollect the deaths of many men\r\nof whom it was said, and truly said, that the world was the poorer for\r\ntheir loss. But they crossed the Styx, and the world jogged on, decently\r\ninconsolable as a widow, and as forgetful.\r\n\r\nWithin the limit of my life in our own country two statesmen only, both\r\nnow long since dead (I do not count Peel, for I was but a small boy when\r\nhe died), yet stir the hearts of men—Disraeli and Gladstone, and even\r\nin the case of the latter the wick in the lamp is already beginning\r\nto flicker ominously. In America there has been one such man, Abraham\r\nLincoln. In France not one. In Italy two, Cavour the great politician\r\nand schemer, Garibaldi the Paladin hero of romance. Here again, as in\r\nthe case of our own two great men, we see a difference. The magic of\r\nCavour’s name would not now raise a company of bersaglieri, whereas that\r\nof Garibaldi would carry the fiery cross through the remotest mountain\r\ndistricts of Italy. The glamour which still casts a halo round the\r\nmemories of such men as Disraeli the mystic, and Garibaldi the great\r\n_condottiere_, lies in their appeal to the imagination. Admire Gladstone\r\nand Cavour as we may and must, we cannot but admit that it would have\r\nbeen impossible to create a flower league in honour of the one or to\r\ncompose a patriotic hymn in celebration of the other.\r\n\r\nThe one German hero of my time who “being dead yet liveth” is Bismarck.\r\nNor, as I think, could a better example be found to illustrate what I\r\nmean by the appeal to the imagination. The idea which his brain evolved,\r\na united Germany—his own creation—queening it among the nations of\r\nEurope, was not only a mighty conception, but it was also one which\r\nfitted into the poetry of the old Germanic mythology. Physically\r\nhe himself, the great heavy-handed giant, had something of the\r\ncharacteristics of the God Thor—Buddhists might have said that he was a\r\nreincarnation of the Thunderer. When Jules Favre went to discuss terms of\r\npeace with him, had not the unhappy Frenchman to face an orgie of strong\r\ndrinks that was a torture to him, topping up with a bowl of flaming\r\nbrandy such as none but an old Norse God could swallow? That was the\r\nhigh-water mark of Kultur and that is why Bismarck lives and will never\r\ndie to the end of time. He forged a terrific weapon, a Siegfried’s sword,\r\nand for the misfortune of the world it has fallen into hands directed by\r\na brain ill-fitted to use it.\r\n\r\nGamblers tell us that the cards never forgive a mistake. The same might\r\nbe said almost—not quite—as truly of politics. Bismarck’s one colossal\r\nmistake was the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, creating in Germany\r\nthat persistent nightmare, the dread of the _revanche_. But for that, the\r\nGermany of his dreams might still be a queen in commerce, in science, in\r\nliterature, a bright beacon shedding its light over the world, gratefully\r\nadmired and even loved. But now!\r\n\r\nGladstone made some mistakes and he left us one heritage of woe—yet his\r\npersonality and the respect which it commanded still survive; it will\r\nbe for another generation to estimate the results of what some of us\r\nthink to be the unhappy dislocation caused by his Irish policy. It has\r\ntaken forty-four years to show the full value of the theft of Alsace and\r\nLorraine. What will be said of Home Rule forty-four years hence? Let us\r\npray!\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt was now the leader of the House of Commons, and very\r\nwell and ably he filled that difficult office. He was really a great\r\nparliamentarian, thoroughly imbued with respect for the House and its\r\ngreat traditions, versed in all the intricacies of its procedure, and a\r\njealous defender of its dignity and privileges. People may say what they\r\nlike, but a great and commanding presence is an asset to him who would\r\nbe a ruler of men. Harcourt’s tall and imposing figure like that of Saul\r\nthe son of Kish, his ready wit and facility of speech, combined with ripe\r\nknowledge and tried experience, made him a great leader. His qualities\r\ngave point to his praise and inspired a certain awe in his followers. If\r\nofficially he was rather a Tartar, out of Office he was a most agreeable\r\nmember of society, full of fun and an excellent _raconteur_,—as a host\r\nincomparable.\r\n\r\nIn the new session the first spark of interest, or perhaps it would be\r\nmore fair to say of amusement, was struck by that delightfully saucy imp\r\nof mischief, Henry Labouchere who, with his tongue in his cheek, proposed\r\nan amendment to the address in which he argued for the abolition of the\r\nVeto of the House of Lords. No account of the House of Commons of his\r\ntime could by any possibility omit to take notice of “Labby.” In spite\r\nof all his impertinencies everybody liked him. The smoking-room was\r\nhis kingdom, and there he sat enthroned, always witty and amusing, and\r\nserving as a bond of union between men of all shades of opinion, some of\r\nwhom, but for him, would never have exchanged a word. He was no respecter\r\nof persons, but was never malevolent except in the case of the chief\r\nof his party, to whom he would quite openly allude as the “grand old\r\nAnanias.” “Don’t you trust that fraudulent old impostor,” was a frequent\r\nsaying of his. There must have been some deep-rooted cause of offence to\r\nprovoke such hostility, for Labouchere was really one of the kindest of\r\nmen. No trouble was too great for him to take on behalf of a friend.\r\n\r\nI remember a case where it was of vital importance to an acquaintance of\r\nhis, by no means an intimate, that a certain case should be kept out of\r\nthe newspapers. Labby sat down at once and wrote off to all the editors\r\nof the chief Radical papers—the Conservative press had already been\r\nsquared—begging them to boycott the case and use their influence with the\r\nsmaller fry in the same sense. No word of the affair ever saw the light.\r\nNow that is a far higher type of kindness than the mere gift of a few\r\npounds the loss of which would not be felt.\r\n\r\nIt was that same kindness which prompted his persistent attacks against\r\nthe harpies and bloodsuckers who prey upon society. His Christmas Toy\r\nFund was another most benevolent institution. In spite of all the violent\r\nabuse to which he was often subjected, I think that he went down to the\r\ngrave with a record of better work than many men who have died in the\r\nodour of sanctity. I knew him fairly well, for though he was about three\r\nyears older than myself we were at Eton together and afterwards in the\r\nDiplomatic Service at the same time, though never at the same post.\r\n\r\nAt the St. James’s Club I once asked him why he was so bitter against\r\nthe House of Lords. Bitterness he disclaimed with a laugh, but he went\r\non to say in his sneering way, “So long as I bring forward a motion from\r\ntime to time for the abolition of the Peers, my seat for Northampton is a\r\nfreehold.” He had just come back from a visit to his constituents who, as\r\nhe told me—with much humour—had entertained him at a public tea, in the\r\nmiddle of which a little girl about twelve or thirteen years old, with\r\ntwo tails down her back like the Kenwigs children in “Nicholas Nickleby,”\r\nwas made to stand upon a chair, being too short to be seen otherwise,\r\nand began to sing a song the impropriety of which was simply appalling.\r\n“I asked the meaning of it,” said Labouchere, “and was told that it was\r\na Malthusian hymn.” It used to be freely said that when his uncle Lord\r\nTaunton died he was in hopes that the peerage would be recreated for him.\r\nThe pranks that he had played when he was in the Diplomatic Service,\r\nthough innocent enough in their rebelliousness, counted against him—so he\r\nhad to content himself with abusing the grapes.\r\n\r\nHe could scoff and flout and sneer—no man better—but often he gave\r\nthe impression of laughing at himself quite as much as at those whom\r\nfor the moment he might be holding in his thumb-screw. It was as if a\r\nman preparing a bitter draught for some other person were careful to\r\nkeep the dregs for his own use and swallow them. Like Thomas Carlyle’s\r\nloud guffaw to which I have alluded elsewhere, his sneers had the\r\nback-hitting qualities of a boomerang. He hated the surroundings into\r\nwhich his affectations drove him, and being at heart an aristocrat of\r\nthe aristocrats, sneered at his class and at himself for being of it and\r\nloving it.\r\n\r\nI imagine that if Sir William Harcourt had been asked by what special\r\nachievement he would choose his worth as politician, statesman and\r\nfinancier to be measured, he would have selected the Death Duties Budget.\r\nAlthough I hated the Bill I am bound to admit that to pilot it through\r\nthe Commons was a great effort. It was full of highly contentious matter,\r\nsome of it as objectionable to his own party as to ours. It was not the\r\nsort of measure that a powerful minister with a servile majority at his\r\nback can bludgeon through a House that has never tamely submitted to\r\nbullying.\r\n\r\nEven now that members are paid there have been signs, comforting signs,\r\nthat an English Member of Parliament still recognizes the dignity and the\r\nself-satisfaction of a conscious independence.\r\n\r\nHarcourt was conciliatory and diplomatic, but he was as firm as a rock.\r\nPersonally, as I have said, I disliked the Bill and I had the audacity\r\nto think it bad finance. It seemed to me that the fortunes of the\r\ninhabitants of a country constitute its capital, and that at every death\r\nto take away a considerable portion of the corpus of the dead man’s\r\nestate is to deplete the capital of the country. If going a step further\r\nyou apply the portion so taken to the purposes of the year, you are then\r\nto that extent treating capital as income. To live upon capital can be\r\nhealthy neither for a private person nor in the case of the public purse.\r\nI maintain that the sum realized out of what I held to be capital should\r\nbe used not as income but for the reduction of the National Debt. I also\r\nthought and still think that an estate should be immune from death duty\r\nfor a certain number of years—otherwise two or more deaths in rapid\r\nsuccession must have a ruinously unjust effect upon estates—and indeed be\r\na still further injurious attack upon the capital of the country. “Then,”\r\nsaid my opponents, “the Bill would cease to be a ‘Death Duties Bill.’”\r\n“Bless my soul,” I answered, “with what equanimity should I behold that\r\ndisaster!” In short, I was told that I was wrong, that I knew nothing\r\nabout finance, and so I held my peace. But I am glad to see that after\r\nall these years there are now many men who are at one with the views of\r\nmy ignorance.\r\n\r\nLord Milner was pretty generally accredited with having been at Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt’s elbow and it was known that it was he who worked\r\nout the details of the Bill; some people went so far as to say that he\r\ninspired it. Lord Milner had been at that time Chairman of the Board\r\nof Inland Revenue for two years, and he was the authority whom, above\r\nall others, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was bound to consult. I am\r\ninclined to think that the idea of the death duties was the Chancellor’s\r\nown conception, which it became the not uncongenial duty of Lord Milner\r\nas a civil servant to work into shape.\r\n\r\nIn Committee especially the Bill met with stout opposition. The men of\r\nour front bench with Mr. Balfour and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach to lead\r\nthem and such doughty champions as Mr. Walter Long and Mr. Chaplin ready\r\nat any moment to spring to arms, fought with great determination. Mr.\r\nGoschen was less than half-hearted. But behind the front bench were\r\nMr. Hanbury, Mr. Byrne, afterwards a judge, and Mr. Bowles. Byrne was\r\na famous lawyer and fighter of inestimable value, a standing menace to\r\nthe Bill. Bowles who in his early days had had the advantage of sound\r\nfinancial training in the legacy department of Somerset House, had by\r\nsheer hard work and talent rapidly made himself a man of note in the\r\nHouse, to be enhanced later by the marked ability which he showed on the\r\nPublic Accounts Committee.\r\n\r\nThat inexorable coiner of happy nick-names, Toby M.P., had in consequence\r\nof a speech on naval affairs—the speech of a seaman full of technical\r\nknowledge—dubbed him “Captain Cuttle,” and Mr. Punch’s academicians from\r\nthat time forth made him famous in that character, by representing him\r\nclad in a reefer and tarpaulin hat, with a hook where he should have\r\nhad a hand. The joke was so exquisitely comic that it laid hold of the\r\npublic, and so well was he known by the hook assigned to him by Toby\r\nM.P., that on one occasion when he was speaking some stranger who was\r\ntold that he was Mr. Bowles indignantly denied the possibility, inasmuch\r\nas he had the full complement of hands, and no hook.\r\n\r\nWell, “the Cap’en,” as Toby called him, was the Chancellor’s most\r\nformidable foe, not only on account of his financial ability, but because\r\nby most accurate historical, legal and constitutional study he had made\r\nhimself master not only of the complicated forms of the House but also\r\nof the facts and precedents which had given rise to those forms. That\r\nknowledge is one of the deadliest weapons which a Parliamentarian can\r\nwield. It is a study which is too much neglected, because it is one\r\nwhich needs the greatest industry, the most patient research. To most\r\nmen it would seem intolerably dull; but it has its reward. It is not\r\ntoo much to say that most of the mistakes that have been made in recent\r\nyears—some of them almost criminal—would have been impossible had members\r\nrealized how they were flying in the face of the laws of their own august\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowles’ interleaved copy of the Bill with every line, every sentence,\r\nevery word, carefully weighed and annotated was a monument of industry.\r\nSo profound was this talented man’s study of its provisions that no\r\nflaw in its harness could escape him. There is no denying that he was\r\nHarcourt’s great danger; but the Bill had been very carefully drawn;\r\nthere might be a good many amendments, but there was no possibility of\r\naltering its principles. There was, however, a moment when Sir William\r\nwas almost in despair of being able to pass his Bill. He relied greatly\r\nupon the profound legal knowledge of Sir John Rigby, the Attorney\r\nGeneral, who was his right-hand man in the conduct of the Bill. Sir John\r\nRigby was to be raised to the Bench—and Sir William looked upon his loss\r\nas fatal—he even, according to Lord Tweedmouth, who had a way of letting\r\ncats out of bags, went so far as to tell the Cabinet that he must drop\r\nthe Bill. As a matter of fact that very loss saved the Bill. Sir John\r\nRigby might be a great lawyer but he was ineffective in the House. A\r\nrather ridiculous appearance likened to that of pantaloon in a pantomime,\r\nand a manner that was anything but dignified, marred his ability. The\r\nurbanity and general popularity of Sir Robert Reid (Lord Loreburn) who\r\nsucceeded him proved to be a godsend to the Chancellor and the measure\r\nwas never in danger.\r\n\r\nI myself had the good fortune to secure one of the rare amendments. In\r\nCommittee I ventured to plead for the exemption of legacies to schools\r\nand universities. Sir William in the most friendly way yielded in the\r\ncase of the universities, but when I pressed him upon the subject of\r\nschools he was obdurate. The curious thing was that not one of the\r\nmembers for universities took up the matter. They sat there silent and\r\nuncaring, and did not even back me up or thank me for having succeeded in\r\ndoing what was obviously their special duty and not mine.\r\n\r\nFor three months we fought ding-dong, and in the end, of course, the big\r\nbattalions won, though with severe gaps in their serried ranks. “Never\r\nmind,” said our men, “when we come into power again we shall put all\r\nthat straight.” I knew better. The ruin of families is a matter of small\r\naccount in the eyes of a Chancellor who is framing a Budget. The death\r\nduties had come to stay, and in staying, grow.\r\n\r\nAfter the emotions of the Home Rule Bill and the thirteen months’\r\nsession, the Parish Councils and the Death Duties Bills, the session of\r\n1895 seemed very insipid. It reminded me of the flesh of the penguins\r\nin the “Swiss Family Robinson,” which the father pronounced to be “une\r\nviande fade” (translated by one of my brothers seventy years ago and\r\nmore, “fade viands”).\r\n\r\nThe House droned on in conscientious dullness until at last it was roused\r\non the 21st of June by the War Minister’s announcement of the resignation\r\nof the Duke of Cambridge, to which I have alluded elsewhere, and an hour\r\nor two later it was thrown into the wildest excitement by the defeat of\r\nthe Government, by a majority of seven, on the supply of cordite. It was\r\nbut a small majority, but it was enough; and when the paper was handed to\r\nMr. Akers-Douglas the intoxication was mænadic. The Government was out.\r\n\r\nIt was the last Division of the House of Commons in which I was destined\r\nto take part, for I was perfectly determined not to stand again. I should\r\nhave liked the House well enough but for the holidays, which were odious.\r\nPrimrose League meetings, bazaars, political gatherings in schoolrooms,\r\nattended perhaps by a dozen yokels, two or three old women and a little\r\nboy, illuminated by a cheap lamp or two, one of which was sure to go out\r\nand smell horribly, made life impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter a session like that of 1893-94 I felt that I had a right to a\r\nlittle peace. Not a bit of it. Before a week was out there came the old\r\ncomplaint, “We have not seen much of our member lately.” Was I Sir Boyle\r\nRoche’s bird? So when the dissolution came I thanked the constituents and\r\nmade my bow, beaten by the hard work of the holidays.\r\n\r\nI was glad to have regained my freedom and went back gleefully to my\r\ngarden, my horses and my turnips; among the latter I include petty\r\nsessions, cottage hospital meetings and their kin. But a chapter in life\r\nis rarely closed without regret, and a seat in the House of Commons\r\ngives a man a sense of being in the swim which he hardly realizes until\r\nhe has lost it. Even so, he has had a great experience and has gained\r\na knowledge of the working of the machinery of the State which nothing\r\nelse can give. A Parliament in which one by one almost all the items of\r\nthe Newcastle[46] programme have been carried into effect, may hardly\r\noffer great temptations to an independent man believing in the good old\r\nConstitution which made England great. Still it is the governing power of\r\nthe country; every man should, as far as possible, make himself master of\r\nits procedure, and the best road to that end is to endeavour to gain a\r\nseat in it. Let him try the experiment for one Parliament, and if, at the\r\nend of that time, he does not like it, he can but put out the lights and\r\nring down the curtain—as I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n1896\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH HOOKER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1896 I brought out a little book, “The Bamboo Garden,” which was\r\nvery well received, though naturally it appealed only to a very limited\r\npublic. Besides a few indulgent friends, it could only interest those\r\nwho possess gardens of sufficient importance to enable them to grow the\r\nplants of which it treats. If I remember right the first account handed\r\nin by the publishers showed a deficit which had to be wiped out by a\r\nconsiderable cheque. In time the edition became exhausted and the book is\r\nnow out of print, so I suppose that in the long run I was no great loser.\r\nHowever, it brought me one triumph which was worth more than money. If\r\nanybody had told me beforehand that I should be mentioned in Sir Joseph\r\nHooker’s great work, “The Flora of British India,” I should have deemed\r\nit as improbable as that I should be made a Knight of the Garter. But\r\nwonderful as it is to me, there I am!\r\n\r\nMy pride may be forgiven if I copy what the great man said. After some\r\npreliminary remarks about the Arundinaria tribe, he writes: “Since\r\nthe above was written, Mr. Freeman-Mitford’s ‘The Bamboo Garden’ has\r\nappeared, a work replete with valuable observations upon the habits, mode\r\nof growth, and other characters of the hardy species of bamboo, including\r\nfive Indian, cultivated by him. In it is pointed out (see ‘Arundinaria\r\nSimoni,’ p. 60) for the first time the true characters of the two types\r\nof sheath and blade that occur in bamboos, and which do not, so far as I\r\nknow, in any other tribe of grasses. In a communication which Mr. Mitford\r\nhas been good enough to make to me on this subject, he has formulated\r\nhis views as follows, and has kindly allowed me to introduce them here.”\r\nThen follows a technical paper by me for which there is no place here.\r\nWas I not justified in feeling proud?\r\n\r\nThe Secretaryship of the Office of Works brought me into relations with\r\nmany of the princes of science, among them there was none who inspired\r\nme with more respect than Sir Joseph Hooker; indeed, for various reasons\r\nwe were brought together so closely that what began as a very pleasant\r\nfriendship warmed into an affection which only ceased with his life. He\r\nretired from his official position at Kew in 1885, and from that time\r\ntill his death, in 1911, we remained in intimate correspondence.\r\n\r\nHe was delightful in conversation. He had done so much and seen so much\r\nfrom the time when he qualified as a surgeon in order to accompany Sir\r\nJames Ross as botanist in the _Erebus_ on the Antarctic Expedition of\r\n1839. He had known practically all the eminent men of science of Europe\r\nand America, and was himself the last survivor of the mighty triumvirate,\r\nDarwin, Hooker, Huxley, whom I also knew as a most charming personality.\r\n\r\nA notable feature in Hooker’s character was his extreme modesty. Of\r\nhis apprenticeship in surgery—no mean feat, accomplished as it was\r\nin a few months—he was wont to talk as if it had been no more than a\r\nboyish lark. Of his great journey in India,—pregnant with important\r\nscientific results,—he spoke as if it had been the mere holiday trip of\r\na restless Englishman, whereas it produced not only what was admittedly\r\none of the best books of travel that ever were written, but also gave\r\nevidence of undaunted courage and of the most astute diplomatic talent\r\nin dealing with critical and unexpected conditions. Simple he was, and\r\nself-effacing, yet when Kew was attacked and a powerful Minister, Mr.\r\nAyrton, whom Dizzy once called the cleverest member of the House of\r\nCommons, attempted to reduce the noble scientific institution of which\r\nhe was the head to the level of the nurserymaid and her perambulator,\r\nhe could show fight to the death, and he won. In order that Kew should\r\nbe beautiful, he was willing to work with all his might. But it must\r\nbe something else besides: it must be a school of botany for the whole\r\nworld. Its first duty was to science.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with myself upon the subject of bamboos, to which I\r\nhave alluded above, bore witness to that quality of modesty which is the\r\nhall-mark of the greatest men, at any rate, it is only the greatest that\r\npossess it. Writing to me once upon a technical point, he told me that he\r\nthought I was wrong. Very timidly, and very respectfully, I stuck to my\r\nguns, and gave my reasons. His answer was characteristic. He admitted the\r\ntruth of what I had urged upon him, saying, “Never hesitate to correct me\r\nif I am wrong.” That, coming from so great a man, was magnificent.\r\n\r\nHooker’s life was ideally beautiful. Following in the footsteps of his\r\ndistinguished father, who was his first master and whom he adored with\r\nall that strength of veneration and love which he showed in all his\r\nfriendships, for instance in that with Darwin, he lived to be recognized\r\nboth at home and abroad as the greatest of living botanists. In middle\r\nlife he passed through a period of delicate health which certainly gave\r\nno promise of the ripe old age which he attained. In 1865, as Sir William\r\nThiselton Dyer tells us, he was so ill that he had to be carried in\r\nblankets by four men to see his dead father’s body leave the house.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, when I was Secretary of the Office of Works, under which Kew\r\nat that time was placed, Sir Joseph came to me and said that the work,\r\nespecially the correspondence with the colonies, had assumed such\r\ndimensions that it was impossible for him to carry it on single-handed.\r\nLord Salisbury was, of all the Ministry, the man most interested in\r\nscience, so, although the matter did not concern his department—then the\r\nIndia Office—I thought it would be a good thing to bespeak his support\r\nin the Cabinet before bringing forward a matter involving extra expense.\r\nLord Salisbury was most sympathetic, and in the end Mr. (now Sir William)\r\nThiselton Dyer was appointed Assistant Director.\r\n\r\nKew went on and prospered greatly; but in 1885 Sir Joseph’s old symptoms\r\nbegan to reappear and he had to resign. Upon the strength of a memorandum\r\nwritten by me, Sir William was appointed to succeed him. Sir William\r\nDyer, to my great regret, has told the world in his obituary notices of\r\nSir Joseph in the Proceedings of the Royal Society and in the “Dictionary\r\nof National Biography” that Kew “in 1850 passed to the control of the\r\nOffice of Works, to which officially it was only a pleasure ground\r\nand which _never_ felt much sympathy for its scientific character and\r\nfunctions.” I have underlined the word _never_ because it could only\r\nmean that Sir William was not referring exclusively to the wretched old\r\nhostility shown by Mr. Ayrton. That Sir Joseph did not always take the\r\nsame view of the relations between himself and the office of which I was\r\nthe head for twelve years—far longer than any other secretary—is proved\r\nby sheaves of letters which I received from him in which he constantly\r\nalludes to the support which I personally gave him. Moreover, those\r\nletters mostly end with the words, “Yours affectionately.” Had I felt\r\nno sympathy with Kew, Sir Joseph would hardly have shown the deepest\r\nsympathy with me for thirty-seven years. As a complete answer to Sir\r\nWilliam Dyer’s twice published attack I am tempted to bring forward\r\nSir Joseph Hooker’s dedication to me of the volume of the _Botanical\r\nMagazine_ for 1897.\r\n\r\n                         “The Camp, Sunningdale, December 1st, 1897.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MITFORD,\r\n\r\n    “Duty and pleasure alike prompt me to offer you the dedication\r\n    of vol. cxxiii. of the _Botanical Magazine_, giving me as it\r\n    does the opportunity of recalling the years of our cordial\r\n    official co-operation when the Royal Gardens profited so\r\n    greatly in every department through your energy, foresight, and\r\n    love of plants.\r\n\r\n    “To this claim I must surely add the service you have rendered\r\n    to horticulture and botany by your labours in introducing,\r\n    cultivating and studying the hardy bamboos, of which your\r\n    charming work, ‘The Bamboo Garden,’ is the first-fruits. Nor\r\n    can I omit an allusion to your own garden, unrivalled as it is\r\n    amongst the private collections of hardy plants in Europe for\r\n    extent, scientific interest and beauty.\r\n\r\n    “Believe me, my dear Mitford,\r\n\r\n                         “Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     “J. D. HOOKER.”\r\n\r\nArmed with this, to Sir William Dyer I think I can say “habet!”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the two alarms of 1865 and 1885, Sir Joseph Hooker’s\r\nvitality was so great that he lived till 1911, and was able to labour\r\non until the summer of that year. Only a few months before his death he\r\nwrote to me about the work upon which he was engaged, a study of the\r\nbalsams, and told me with pride that he was able to use his microscope as\r\nwell as ever.\r\n\r\nI went to see him that summer in his lovely suntrap at Sunningdale. He\r\nwas the same bright, cheerful friend of old days and most affectionate\r\nin his welcome. The microscope and the MSS. littered on his study\r\ntable still spoke of work, work, work. “It’s dogged as does it,” was\r\na favourite quotation of his. We went into the garden and Lady Hooker\r\ngave us tea under the trees. He chatted gaily over old times and about\r\nold friends, and was greatly interested in the talk of an American\r\nlady, a lover of trees, who had come to pay him a visit. But in spite\r\nof his indomitable spirits I found him much aged during the last few\r\nmonths—indeed, at ninety-four that was to be expected, and I felt that\r\nthis would be our last meeting. I was not much surprised when I heard\r\nthat on the 10th of December the dear old man had passed away, mercifully\r\nand painlessly, in his sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n1898\r\n\r\nANURADHAPURA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1898, business took me once more to Ceylon. One of my sons\r\nhad gone out there to start in life as a tea-planter, and I must needs\r\ngo to see how he was faring and what were his prospects for the future.\r\nAnd so we set out, my daughter Iris and I, and my old friend Reginald\r\nYorke, the best of shipmates, came with us. He, too, had a son in Ceylon,\r\nwho some years later was crushed to death against a tree by a wounded\r\nelephant in East Africa.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw Ceylon in 1865 Point de Galle was the place of call for\r\nsteamers—a bad and dangerous harbour, but so prodigally beautiful, with\r\nits coral reefs and its palm groves fringing the sea, studded with the\r\nquaint outrigged boats of the fisher-folk, that one could fancy oneself\r\narriving in such an island as those into which Captain Cook felt his way\r\nin the Pacific. Galle was quite unspoilt and primitive—just like the\r\npictures of the spice islands in the travel books of our childhood—a\r\nfitting approach to one of the fairest of God’s creations. I felt as if\r\nI should never weary of watching the intensely blue sea lapping the very\r\nroots of the cocoanut palms, which tradition said could never flourish\r\nfar from the sound of its waves. Here was indeed the poetry of travel,\r\nthe reward of them “that go down to the sea in ships ... and see the\r\nworks of the Lord and His wonders in the deep.”\r\n\r\nColombo is very different, and I am glad that my first amazed sight of\r\nthe tropics was at Galle, and not in a place, safe indeed, but eminently\r\nprosaic and uninspiring. Colombo is Ceylon, the land of business men,\r\nplanters, jewel merchants and Dutch-hybrids; Galle was Lanka, that\r\nancient island from which Wijayo, the invader, expelled the demons; the\r\nland of saints and heroes and kings; the land of romance and holy lore,\r\nof which the Mahawanso, “The Genealogy of the Great,” is the epic.\r\n\r\nThere was no temptation to spend a needless hour in Colombo. Happily the\r\ntrain soon whirls the traveller into the midst of the baffling beauty of\r\nthe scenery that lies between the sea and Kandy, scenery so lovely that\r\nthe traveller feels inclined to rub his eyes and ask whether this can be\r\nreal, whether he is not asleep, and tasting a dream-vision of paradise.\r\n\r\nHatton, whither we were bound, is less beautiful, for the glory of the\r\njungle has been ruthlessly swept away to make room for the tea-plant.\r\nEvery available inch is under cultivation of what at first sight look\r\nlike euonymus plants set out in a nursery gardener’s rows. Here and\r\nthere are pretty villas, with gardens full of all manner of strange and\r\nattractive plants: for Hatton is a great centre, and, lying high, is\r\nvery healthy, so there are many planters who come here for refreshment\r\nafter months spent in the feverish damp of the lowland rubber and\r\ncocoanut plantations. And yet even here a man may turn his back upon the\r\nrupee-bearing tea-plant and feast his eyes upon a great mountain shaped\r\nlike a crouching lion, or upon the distant majesty of Adam’s Peak, with\r\nits legends and its ghost. Here we stayed for some while, for there was\r\nplenty to do.\r\n\r\nAlong the road, not more than a mile or so, if my memory serves me, from\r\nHatton, there was a small Roman Catholic chapel and graveyard, to which\r\nsome good priest came from time to time, to say mass, hear confessions,\r\nand shrive his flock. It was no more than a tiny plaster hut, fifteen\r\nfeet by eight, with an altar, and on the altar two candlesticks on either\r\nside of the Figure on the Cross, to which some humble, pious soul had\r\nadded as ornaments his two most precious treasures: two empty Huntley and\r\nPalmer biscuit-tins! It was a most touching offering, reminding me of the\r\nwidow’s mite.\r\n\r\nOnce before I had come across the traces of the great Reading potentates\r\nin a strange place. It was in Mongolia, three or four hundred miles\r\nnorth of Peking. I had taken refuge from the noon-day sun in a Mongol\r\nencampment, and the chieftainess, a fat, hideous old woman, shapeless in\r\nher sheepskin robe, allowed me and my companion, for a consideration, to\r\nrest in her _yurt_, a leathern tent with an opening at the top to let out\r\nthe smoke of the camel-dung fire. She was a great lady in her way, though\r\nvery dirty, and the outward and visible sign of her high position was a\r\nlarge Huntley and Palmer tin, in which were growing a few heads of garlic\r\nwherewith to flavour the mess of mutton and millet, with chunks of brick\r\ntea and salt, which was stewing in her gipsy kettle. Of that tin she was\r\nas proud as a duchess of her strawberry leaves.\r\n\r\nWhen the preliminaries of my business were settled I had a few days\r\non my hands, while the lawyers were playing their part. If the law is\r\nslow in England it will readily be conceived that it acquires no speed\r\nin the sweltering heat of Colombo; so Yorke and I determined, after\r\nseeing Neuara Eliya and Kandy, to go and explore the mysteries of the\r\nburied city of Anuradhapura far away in the north. I believe that it\r\nis now brought into touch with the rest of the world by a railway; but\r\nseventeen years ago that did not exist. So we hired a carriage and\r\nstarted from Matalé. We saw the carved cave temples of Dambulla and in\r\nthe distance the great rock fortress of Sigiri—marvels in their way; but\r\nthe attraction was Anuradhapura, the capital of the kings when Lanka had\r\nnot yet become degraded into Ceylon.\r\n\r\nFor many miles the road ran through the thick, impenetrable forest—a\r\nlittle thinner in places close to the wayside. Here and there a small\r\nclearing and a few native huts; but for the most part not a human\r\nhabitation, nor a brown man, woman, or child, to be seen. The steamy air\r\nwas full of that subtle, mysterious perfume of heavily-scented flowers\r\nand rich, pungent spices which is wafted far out to sea. The very\r\nleaves of the forest seemed to thrill at the voluptuous caress of the\r\nsoft, perfumed breeze. A delicious, languorous, enervating atmosphere,\r\nin which to dream and never to do. Some of the huge butterflies are\r\nvery beautiful. Of birds we did not see many, nor did we hear their\r\nsong—though some are said to pipe most sweetly. One bird there is that\r\nbreaks the stillness with its hoarse melancholy croak in which the\r\nSinghalese imagination hears the words, “Ko Hattha Paroa! Ko Hattha\r\nParoa! Where are the seven axes!” Just as our children hear in the call\r\nof the cushat the exhortation to the thief to “take two coos, Taffy—take\r\ntwo coos, Taffy.”\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived in a village of Lanka a woman who had\r\nseveral sons, all of whom dwelt with her. One day the seven brothers\r\nwent out into the forest to cut wood. The night fell, the evening meal\r\nof rice was prepared, but no sons came home to partake of it. Their\r\nmother wondered, but took no great heed, thinking that some accident had\r\ndelayed them, until the next day men from a neighbouring village came and\r\ntold her that her sons had been killed and eaten by wild beasts. But she\r\nbeing a covetous and greedy woman uttered no wail of sorrow for the lost\r\nchildren whom she had borne, but only cried out: “Ko Hattha Paroa! Where\r\nare the seven axes?” Oh, cruel! cruel! oh, heartless mother! whose sons\r\nwere dead and she only mourned over the loss of the axes! So the Gods\r\nwere wroth, and to punish her turned her into a bird, laying upon her\r\nthis curse, that till the crack of doom, knowing no rest, she should flit\r\nthrough the darkness of the jungle, ever uttering her unhappy cry: “Where\r\nare the seven axes? Where are the seven axes?”\r\n\r\nThe road itself is the only sign of man’s handiwork. The forms and\r\ncolours of the jungle are often startlingly beautiful. Some of the trees\r\nremind one of home; others, roped together by graceful lianes, are a\r\nrevelation—their branching, their foliage, and their flowers a new\r\nsensation. Mixed with them are feathering bamboos, barbarously gorgeous\r\ncrotons and poinsettias, and here and there an orchid, peering out of\r\na cranny in a rock. From a great picturesque stone by the roadside I\r\nbrought back two deliciously scented odontoglossums which flourished for\r\nyears at Batsford.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, as we drove along, we were aware of a large company of\r\nmonkeys, some thirty or forty of them, of all sizes and ages, running\r\nby the side of the road, just inside the thicket. They were led by an\r\nold and venerable ape, very grey, with white whiskers, the image of a\r\nHyde Park preacher—had he only worn a shabby black coat, shiny in greasy\r\npatches and at the elbows, he would have acted the part to perfection. He\r\nwas a dictatorial old gentleman, whose word was a law unto his people. I\r\nsay “word,” for that he had some means of issuing his commands to them\r\nwas certain; that they understood him and obeyed his orders was equally\r\ncertain. Sometimes he led the way, sometimes he dropped back and gathered\r\nin stragglers. He was apparently much agitated, though we could not have\r\nbeen the cause, for he made no attempt to avoid us, but led his troop\r\nparallel to our carriage. After running like that for three or four\r\nhundred yards, he gave the word of command, and the whole troop crossed\r\nthe road in front of us. We stopped the carriage to see what happened.\r\nAfter, perhaps, a hundred more yards, the monkeys disappeared into the\r\njungle on the other side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard a rustling on the side on which the monkeys had first\r\nappeared. I was aware of two gleaming yellow eyes, and presently a\r\ngreat leopard, cautiously, stealthily, crept out of the dense foliage,\r\nevidently following the spoor. I could have shot him at less than ten\r\nyards. In a moment he caught sight of us as our carriage stood still in\r\nthe road, gave one spring back and vanished. He doubtless was the cause\r\nof the old preacher’s strategic retreat, and our presence helped him to\r\nmake it good.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw those yellow eyes I could but think of the myriads of eyes\r\nlurking in the jungle, watching unseen, like Fates—eyes of birds, eyes\r\nof beasts, eyes of strange, weird insects, little beadlike eyes peering\r\nsleeplessly out of flat, triangular heads that lie deadly in the centre\r\nof glistening scaled coils. Two little pricks, no more of a wound\r\nthan could be made by the point of a tiny needle, and in half an hour\r\ndeath—death unshriven. What a wicked, sinful, murderous jungle! How\r\nbeautiful and how mysterious!\r\n\r\nMen talk of the silence of the jungle. Is the jungle ever silent? Is\r\nthere not always the murmur of leaf and bough, stirred in some mysterious\r\nway like the quivering aspen—the legendary tree of the Holy Cross, never\r\nat rest—even when there seems to be no wind? Is there not always the\r\nrustling whisper of malevolent creatures in ambush, waiting to destroy\r\nsomething feebler or less cunning than themselves? What a sight it would\r\nbe if, as God paraded the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air\r\nbefore Adam that he might name them, we might cause the creatures of\r\njust one square mile of the Singhalese forest to be driven in procession\r\nbefore us! The variety of forms, the contrast of stature and girth,\r\nfrom the huge elephant down to the minutest of creeping things—what a\r\nwonder-world it would reveal!\r\n\r\nAs we neared the mystic city, the night fell. In this land there is\r\nno twilight, no delicious gloaming, no opalescent fading of the glare\r\nof day into the soft, loving mystery of night. The darkness came down\r\nlike a dense black veil upon the jungle: the death of the day was\r\nsudden, remorseless. But all at once, out of the gloom there shone a\r\ngreat light. There was no moon, but millions upon millions of fireflies\r\nfloated gracefully, dancing in the air over the jungle; it was as if the\r\nstars which were shining gloriously overhead had sent down shower after\r\nshower of dazzling sparks—tiny jewelled morsels of the Southern Cross—to\r\nilluminate our triumphant entry into what now looked like the city of\r\nsome wonder-working magician. We could see the outlines of buildings,\r\ntemples, palaces, and above all, here and there the great Dagobas, rising\r\nout of the plain like isolated hills covered with a pall of dense trees\r\nand lianes, piercing the darkness of the night. Once they were noble\r\nshrines of brickwork, proudly rearing their tiara-like towers heavenward,\r\nbuilt to encase some relic of the Wise One, the Buddha; but centuries of\r\nneglect have smothered them with vegetation out of all shape, till only\r\ntheir great height remains of all their former glory.\r\n\r\nWonderful are the ways of the jungle! A leaf falls and decays into dust,\r\nsettling into some chink of a mouldering wall. Little by little other\r\nleaves join it and decay into mould. A bird drops a seed; tropical\r\nrains wash it into the haven of rest; there, fulfilling its mission, it\r\ngerminates in the ever moist soil, to which as a pious child it in time\r\nadds its tribute of falling foliage. More seeds are borne by other birds,\r\nor carried on the wings of the wind. More decay breeds more life, until\r\nby degrees all trace of building vanishes, swallowed up by an omnivorous\r\nparasitic growth. The work of man’s hand, the record of the ambition of\r\nkings and of a priestly caste would be lost and forgotten, but for the\r\ninquisitive West, which never rests from digging into the secrets of the\r\nEast, guarded in vain by the seven-headed cobras, the Nagas of Hindu myth.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the learned curiosity of Mr. Turnour, the Mahawanso,\r\nthe great epic poem of Ceylon, the Book of Kings of the island, would\r\nperhaps never have been deciphered, and the secrets of the ruins of\r\nAnuradhapura would have remained as great a riddle as those of Stonehenge\r\nor the Rollright Stones. Although the reading of the Mahawanso did not\r\npresent the same gigantic difficulties as the cuneiform inscriptions of\r\nNineveh, it was yet a task of great difficulty. The records were kept\r\nby priests; they were written in Pali, the language of the Buddhist\r\npriesthood, imperfectly understood by themselves, but in diction so\r\nmystic and obscure that the ancient scribes found it necessary to write a\r\ncommentary, or translation into the vulgar tongue of the dark original.\r\nThis _tika_, as it was called, appears to have been lost until about\r\nthe year 1826, when it was discovered among a collection of manuscripts\r\nwhich were given to Mr. Turnour by the high priest of Saffragam. Even the\r\npriests, lazy and ignorant, could make nothing of the precious legacy of\r\ntheir predecessors. Once he was possessed of the invaluable clue, Mr.\r\nTurnour’s task must have been comparatively lightened. Still it remained\r\na great feat, thanks to which we are the richer by a human document of\r\nthe highest interest. Sir James Emerson Tennent’s account of Mr. Turnour\r\nand his labours is well worth reading.\r\n\r\nStrip the old Pali Poem of its monkish legends and fairy tales, and we\r\nhave the authentic story of an ancient civilization, some five hundred\r\nyears older than our own era. It is the tale of men who lived and loved\r\nand hated and fought; of men who bought and sold and were moved by the\r\nsame greed of gain, the same passions, the same ambitions that move us\r\nto-day. Whatever their faults or their crimes may have been, all that\r\nthey did was on a colossal scale. Their ideas were magnificent, heroic.\r\n\r\nWhen in the sixth century before Christ, the great conqueror Wijayo came\r\nfrom India as a merchant and established his power in Ceylon, the first\r\nneed was to assure the food supply of the island, which up to that time\r\nhad been mainly dependent upon imported rice; food meant agriculture,\r\nand agriculture meant irrigation; hence those vast reservoirs in which\r\nthe great crocodiles still lurk, basking lazily on the sunburnt rocks\r\nat Anuradhapura. Two hundred years later came the Apostle of Buddhism,\r\nMahindo.\r\n\r\nTissa—Dewananpia Tissa—the beloved of the saints—was at that time king;\r\nhe quickly became converted and begged Mahindo to pray Asoka, the famous\r\nKing of Maghada, to bestow upon him a cutting of the sacred Bō tree\r\n(ficus religiosa) under which Prince Siddartha sat in the Mrigadeva,\r\nthe deer forest near Benares, where he preached his first sermon after\r\nhe had attained perfect wisdom. Asoka was willing, but there was a\r\ndifficulty—the sacred tree must not be cut with a knife; so a miracle was\r\nrequired and the miracle came. With a vermilion pencil the king painted a\r\ncircle round the chosen branchlet. Immediately heavenly music was heard,\r\nthe wind raged and the thunder roared, the beasts of the forest howled,\r\nbirds screamed, demons yelled, men shouted; the little branch detached\r\nitself and planted itself in a golden vase prepared by Mahindo’s sister,\r\nthe holy Sanghamitta, when it happily took root and was transported with\r\ngreat solemnity and pomp to Ceylon, where with more miracles and divine\r\nmanifestations of the elements, it was planted in that sacred enclosure\r\nin which it stands to this day. It is undoubtedly the oldest tree in the\r\nworld for the planting of which the date can be fixed. For upwards of\r\ntwo thousand years there it has stood, the object of worship by pilgrims\r\nfrom all those countries where the memory of Buddha is held sacred. For\r\nall those centuries the same litanies have been recited before it, the\r\nperfume of the champak and other flowers, the offering beloved of Buddha,\r\nlaid in the same patterns, has risen from its four altars.\r\n\r\nKings and High Priests, men mighty in many lands, have carried hither\r\ntheir sins and their penitence, praying for the mercy of a pure life\r\nand the attainment of that mysterious hereafter which men call Nirvana.\r\nAnd the sacred tree itself?—The wonderful tree before which throughout\r\nthe ages millions upon millions of men have prostrated themselves in\r\nadoration? Not a majestic specimen as such trees go—indeed, it is\r\nundutifully dwarfed by its own descendants mounting guard over it in\r\nthe various courtyards of the Temple. Yet there it stands in all its\r\nsanctity, just as it was described by the old Chinese pilgrim Fa Hsien,\r\nwho saw it in the fourth century. The Temple, or, rather, perhaps I\r\nshould say the enclosure, occupies about two or three acres. It is\r\nsurrounded by an outer wall some twelve feet high. To the left and\r\nto the right of the entrance gate are two huge Bō trees, each with a\r\npalm-tree growing out of it, said to be emblems connected with primitive\r\nforms of nature worship. Some of the masonry is curious. The stones are\r\nlaid upon their edges, lozenge-wise, and of these the alternate stones\r\nare omitted, leaving a series of lozenge-shaped niches blackened with the\r\ngrease and smoke of ages, for on high days and holy days myriads of lamps\r\nare set a-burning in them.\r\n\r\nTravelling makes us feel the narrow boundaries which have been set for\r\nthe working of man’s brain. Wander over the face of the earth and you\r\nwill find the same proverbs, the same fairy-tales, the same legends, the\r\nsame ghosts, the same superstitions—even the same jokes. You will find\r\nthe stories of Boccaccio and the “Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles” repeated\r\nin China and Japan. In all these cases the difference is only in the\r\nclothing in which local custom dresses them. So with religious offerings:\r\nwe lay our roses and lilies and violets upon the altar; the Singhalese\r\nbrings the champak; the idea is the same. Flowers and lamps! Like the\r\nvestal virgins, all men light fire in their sacred places.\r\n\r\nOther relics were given by King Asoka. Dagobas were raised to contain\r\nthese—colossal structures of solid brickwork with a tiny receptacle for\r\nthe sacred treasure. So the new religion flourished greatly and the piety\r\nof successive kings founded great monasteries containing thousands of\r\nmonks, little heeding that these comfortable homes were the negation\r\nof a rule as strict as that of St. Francis, which enjoined upon the\r\nyellow-robed shavelings no better dwelling than a “pansala,” a shelter of\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nFancy and imagination are wonderful architects, but it is hard even for\r\nthem to build up a semblance of the glories of Anuradhapura as they must\r\nhave been in the days when the great Brazen Palace, of which the sixteen\r\nhundred jagged stone pillars still stand, upheld a colony of some two\r\nthousand monks in its nine stories: days when, scattered over the vast\r\nplain, buildings the magnificence of which is witnessed in the sculptured\r\nstones, seven-headed Nagas, and elaborately carved moonstones, huge half\r\ndiscs of granite decorated with processions of elephants, lions, horses\r\nand the sacred goose (hansa), and scroll-work that is almost Italian in\r\nfeeling, rose at the bidding of an art which had reached its zenith when\r\nwe were still in darkness. Gold, precious gems, and colours were used\r\nin profusion to adorn what is now the mere wreckage of a past barbaric\r\ngrandeur, swallowed up in the riotous vegetation of the tropics. Fa Hsien\r\nbears eloquent witness to the wealth of flowers used in the worship at\r\nthe temples, and the richness of the innumerable royal gardens is a\r\nmatter of history.\r\n\r\nAs regards the authenticity of the Bō tree, Tennent argues well that it\r\nmust be the identical tree and no substitute planted to replace one that\r\nhad died. Had that tree, sacred throughout the East, died, its death\r\ncould not have been concealed; the emotion created by the news would have\r\nbeen too deep. The story of the loss must have penetrated furthest Asia.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed much in the story of the ancient Buddhist Kings of Ceylon\r\nwhich calls up wonder and praise. They were great gentlemen. Here is\r\na story of knightly virtue that is worth retailing. Two hundred years\r\nbefore our era Elala, a Malabar adventurer, invaded Ceylon, defeated\r\nand killed the reigning King Asela, and reigned for forty years over\r\nthe island. At the end of that time Dutugaimunu, a prince of the old\r\nroyal family, whose dream it had been from boyhood to exterminate the\r\nMalabars, raised an army against Elala and after prodigies of valour\r\ndefeated and slew him. There his enmity ceased. Full of admiration for\r\nthe dead usurper’s courage, and for the justice which he had shown during\r\nforty years—even though a Brahman, protecting the Buddhist priesthood—he\r\nerected a great monument on the spot where Elala died, and there it\r\nstill stands a record of a true knight’s generosity. Moreover he issued\r\na decree that even the Kings of Lanka should on nearing the monument\r\nsilence the music of their processions and dismount from their litters,\r\nand this custom continued well into the nineteenth century, when the\r\nkings had long since disappeared. Could a Bayard have shown greater\r\nchivalry towards a dead enemy?\r\n\r\nThere are now probably more travellers who visit Anuradhapura than there\r\nwere when I was there. As for the residents, there were men who had\r\npassed the best years of their lives in Ceylon and had barely heard of\r\nit. The old city was to them as are St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower\r\nof London to the average West End Londoner—something so near that there\r\nis no need to hurry to go and see it. For myself, I would gladly have\r\nspent weeks among the scattered ruins, and even have gone further afield\r\nto see and learn—but time pressed and we had to hie back.\r\n\r\nI was loth to leave the wilds without obtaining a glimpse of the Veddahs,\r\nthose primitive savages whom the Indian Conqueror, Wijayo, drove into\r\nthe forests and rock caves which are still their lairs, just as Jimmu\r\nTennō, perhaps a century earlier, had hunted the Ainus of Japan. There\r\nis no doubt that these are the lineal descendants of the ancient Yakkos\r\ndescribed in the Mahawanso, of the truthfulness of which they are a\r\nliving proof. The testimony is reciprocal. No wonder that the Brahmans in\r\nall their pride of race and high breeding should have looked upon these\r\nhideous and degraded savages as Demons. Perhaps nowhere on the face of\r\nthis earth does there exist a more untamed race. They know no God and\r\nhave no religion; a few guttural sounds, which are their only means of\r\ncommunication, can scarcely be called a language. Twelve arrows were once\r\ngiven to them to be distributed equally among four recipients. There was\r\nno man among their chiefs who was capable of so abstruse a calculation.\r\nTheir food is of the filthiest, though they cook the flesh of the\r\nmonkeys and giant lizards which are their most relished dainties—the\r\nformer almost cannibalism. Their weapons are the bow and a sort of rude\r\nhatchet; their clothes as little as maybe; they have not to contend with\r\ncold, and decency is the least of their cares. In their persons they are\r\nappallingly ugly and repulsive. Their misshapen limbs are deformed, their\r\nmouths and teeth animal and revolting. Long and filthy matted black hair,\r\nand in the men beards, reach to their middle, falling in tangled strands.\r\nSuch is the description given of them by Tennent and others. The picture\r\nof a race belonging to a prehistoric age, to a long since forgotten\r\nworld. And yet in spite of all this, so great is the respect paid to\r\npedigree by the Singhalese, ashamed of their mixed ancestry, that these\r\ndegraded but pure-raced outcasts are looked upon as beings of a high\r\ncaste, their very barbarism shrouding them in the glamour of eld.\r\n\r\nHow many of these poor wretches there may be cannot be reckoned with\r\naccuracy; among scattered tribes living in hiding-places no census is\r\npossible. In the opinion of an old and well-informed settler in Ceylon,\r\nthey do not exceed two thousand—if indeed there are as many. It is\r\nnot too much to say that the Veddahs are one of the greatest of human\r\ncuriosities. It is difficult to think of a race living for twenty-five\r\ncenturies unchanged, untouched by any vestige of progress, and that too,\r\nnot cast away upon a desert island—not lost like Stanley’s pygmies in the\r\nbaneful swamps of the dark African forest, but living cheek by jowl with\r\nfive successive civilizations, the Brahman, the Buddhist, the Portuguese,\r\nthe Dutch, and the British. It is difficult to believe that as time\r\nspeeds on some measure of civilization will not at last penetrate even\r\nthis survival of the unfittest.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tiele, the learned Dutch author of “The History of Religion,”\r\nsays: “The statement that there are nations or tribes which possess no\r\nreligion, rests either on inaccurate observation, or on a confusion of\r\nideas. No tribe or nation has yet been met with destitute of belief in\r\nany higher beings; and travellers who asserted their existence have been\r\nafterwards refuted by the facts.” Ceylon is easily accessible and it\r\nwould be interesting if some scientific investigator would tell the truth\r\nof what has been said of the Veddahs. That they should believe in no\r\nspirit, worship no fetish, seems incredible.\r\n\r\nThis was a delightful journey, with something of the charm of the olden\r\ntime about it. We rode in our own carriage, such as it was; started at\r\nour own time, stopped where we pleased, and lingered by the way as our\r\nfancy might dictate. Nowadays—well, as Thackeray once put it, “We arrive\r\nat places, but we travel no more.”[47]\r\n\r\nI am loth to bid farewell even to the memory of the beautiful island.\r\nEight years later, in 1906, I was there again, but only on a flying\r\nvisit, when Prince Arthur’s mission was on its way to Japan to invest\r\nthe Mikado with the Order of the Garter. We had to make the most of the\r\nfew hours which were allotted to us, but we managed to run up through\r\ndreamland to Kandy, to stand in wonder by the side of the beautiful\r\nlake. Through a motley crowd, in which the picturesque old-world dresses\r\nof the chieftains, the bright yellow robes and brown shaven pates of\r\nthe Buddhist monks were conspicuous, we were taken to see the Temple of\r\nthe Tooth and its sacred relic, which was to be shown in honour of a\r\nRoyal Prince, but which no man but the ordained priest must touch. When\r\nthe King of Siam visited the Temple, he wished to be allowed to hold\r\nthe Tooth in his hand. But the priests would not hear of it. In vain\r\nhe pleaded that in his youth he, too, had been ordained. No! said the\r\npriests; he had forsaken the priesthood and abjured his vows and it must\r\nnot be. He insisted, but they were obdurate, and so in his misery, like\r\nthe Israelites by the waters of Babylon, the King of Siam sat down and\r\nwept.\r\n\r\nOnce, as we were told, the priest-guardians of the Holy Tooth were\r\noutwitted. Between forty and fifty years ago there arrived from Siam\r\na company of pious monks, bearing with them a vessel of their temple\r\nfilled with holy water, into which it was their purpose to dip the sacred\r\nTooth in order that they might carry back with them to their own country\r\nsome of its mystic virtues. On arriving at Kandy, they were told that\r\nto obtain this favour would be no easy matter—indeed, that it would be\r\nwell-nigh impossible. However, they made their wish known to one Tikiri\r\nBanda, a Singhalese of high caste and a man of authority, and he, not\r\nwithout due bribes, promised to make an agreement with the priests of the\r\nTemple in order that their wishes might be fulfilled. On a certain day\r\nthey went to the Temple, bearing with them their sacred vessel of holy\r\nwater. In the meantime it had become noised abroad that some desecration\r\nof the Tooth was contemplated; a crowd flocked into Kandy from the\r\nneighbouring villages, full of wrath lest this evil thing should be done:\r\nas at Ephesus when the holiness of the Temple of Diana was threatened,\r\nthere was a mighty stir and great confusion. The priests were willing\r\nenough to show the Tooth to their brethren from Siam, but they were not\r\nwilling that it should be touched or dipped in the water. So there arose\r\na hot dispute, in which Tikiri Banda was attacked by both sides.\r\n\r\nAs it fell out, the Government agent happened to be passing that way,\r\nand being aware of a great commotion, went into the Temple to see what\r\nwas amiss; recognizing Tikiri Banda, he called upon him to explain.\r\n“Sir,” said Tikiri Banda, “this is a small matter not worthy of your\r\nExcellency’s attention. These pious men do but wish to do thus in order\r\nthat their country may have a share in the virtues of this holy relic\r\nof our Lord Buddha.” And fitting the action to his words, before the\r\ndumbfoundered and gaping priests of the Temple could stop him, he took\r\nthe Tooth reverently between his fingers and dipped it in the bowl. The\r\ntrick was done.\r\n\r\nAnd that is how by this man’s cunning the priests of the Temple were\r\ndiscomfited and the priests from Siam having obtained their pious wish\r\nwere able to carry back the blessed water to their own country, where no\r\ndoubt it has performed many notable miracles and wonders.\r\n\r\nThe Tooth has often been described. It is of enormous size, and by\r\nheretics it is believed to be the tooth of an elephant. It must be\r\nremembered that according to monkish legend Buddha was of supernatural\r\nstature—one authority says that he was eighteen feet high; another\r\nthirty. A suitable tooth had to be found. Monasteries appear to be all\r\nover the world schools for the painting of lilies and the embroidery of\r\nfine gold.\r\n\r\nClose to the Shrine of the Tooth there is another temple, which we were\r\ntold was mixed Hindu and Buddhist. Only once in the year does a priest\r\nenter the sacred building; for the rest of the time its solitary tenant\r\nis a very old cobra, whom the priests feed with milk passed in under\r\nthe door in a platter. When the priest goes in the snake retires into\r\na corner, where he sits up, with his hood spread out, to watch the\r\nproceedings. Sheltered under the piety of his hosts, who may not take\r\nlife, not even that of a poisonous snake, he is safe from all hurt. Now\r\nsince cobras as is well known always live in pairs, as they came out of\r\nthe Ark, this ancient snake on the contrary seems to have followed the\r\nmonastic rule of celibacy appropriate to his holy domicile. Seeing that\r\nBuddhism was in its inception a revolution against Brahmanism, it seems\r\nincongruous, if true, that one sacred building should harbour the two\r\nreligions. Hardly more incongruous, perhaps, than that a sacred Bō tree,\r\na scion of the old tree of Anuradhapura, growing in the enclosure of the\r\nBritish church, and surrounded by two tiers of ornamental masonry, should\r\nbe hung with rags and _ex votos_ by humble penitents. It is good to think\r\nof the generosity of a clergyman who can respect the heartfelt religion\r\nof those among whom he dwells, even though it be not his own.\r\n\r\nIt was sad to be obliged to rush away from Ceylon as soon as we had\r\nreached it. A mere glimpse of its loveliness was tantalizing, but the\r\nfurthest East was calling, and we must obey the summons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n1900\r\n\r\nKING LEOPOLD II\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, 1900, England was startled and shocked by the news\r\nthat the Prince and Princess of Wales had been shot at. They were on\r\ntheir way to Denmark, and their train was at rest at Brussels when a\r\nyoung ruffian named Sipido fired two shots at the Prince point blank.\r\nHappily both shots missed their aim. Those who were with him assured me\r\nafterwards that the Prince never flinched or moved a muscle of his face.\r\nHe was absolutely cool and unconcerned—probably the only person present\r\nwho showed no emotion. England was deeply incensed. We could not think\r\nwhy a Prince who was so dearly loved both at home and abroad should have\r\nbeen the object of this wanton and murderous attack. I wrote at once to\r\ncongratulate him on his escape and by return of post received the gay,\r\nlight-hearted letter which was so characteristic of him:\r\n\r\n                                               “Copenhagen, April 7.\r\n\r\n    “I am most grateful for your kind letter of sympathy on what\r\n    might have been very serious, but fortunately ‘M. l’anarchiste’\r\n    was a novice at pistol shooting—as I cannot imagine how he\r\n    missed me at two yards. However, ‘All’s well that ends well,’\r\n    and the sympathy shown us has been most gratifying.”\r\n\r\nRoyal personages need some courage to face these attempts, which on one\r\noccasion King Umberto, after being shot at, turning round to his equerry,\r\ncoolly called the “buonamani del nostro mestiere!”[48] A later attack was\r\nmore successful and more tragic!\r\n\r\nThree men besides Sipido, who turned out to be a mere boy of fifteen,\r\nwere tried for the outrage. But the Belgian authorities did not behave\r\nwell on this occasion. The three accomplices were acquitted and young\r\nSipido was sentenced to be placed under police supervision until he\r\nshould come of age—an amazing sentence for such a crime! Probably not\r\nwithout connivance he escaped to France and was only sent back to Belgium\r\nunder the extradition treaty between the two countries at the demand of\r\nthe British Government. It was made out that the attack was a protest\r\nagainst the Boer War; but there was an undercurrent of hostility on\r\nthe part of Belgium which had been strengthening for some time. That\r\nhostility was the work of King Leopold.\r\n\r\nThe relations which existed between the old King Leopold, the Nestor of\r\nEurope, as he was called, and Queen Victoria, are well known. When his\r\nson came to the throne in 1865, the friendly relations between him and\r\nhis English cousins continued. The King was a great collector of Chinese\r\nworks of art, and the Prince of Wales brought him one day, in 1870, to\r\nmy father’s house to see the porcelain and enamels which I had brought\r\nback from Peking. The terms on which they then were could only be called\r\ncordial and affectionate, and thus they lasted until after the year 1878,\r\nwhen the Congo Free State was established.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the King, and the cruelties to which it led, entirely\r\nalienated the Prince of Wales, whose kind heart could brook nothing of\r\nthe kind; while the rumours which were current all over Europe as to the\r\nprivate life of the King made him personally odious to Queen Victoria;\r\nthe position became more and more strained, until at last the King’s\r\nvisits to England were more or less private and secret; on more than one\r\noccasion I met him prowling about the streets of London unattended, and\r\nevidently wishing to avoid recognition, though he spoke to me once when I\r\ncame suddenly upon him and he could hardly help it.\r\n\r\nI had good reason to know how bitterly he felt the coldness of his\r\nEnglish relations, accentuated as it was by the deservedly violent\r\nattacks upon him in the English Press, for in 1903 I was _Président\r\nd’honneur_ of the International Jury at the quinquennial exhibition of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Belgium held at\r\nGhent. The King came and it was part of my duty to accompany him round\r\nthe show. When we came to the Congo section, he took me on one side\r\nand spoke to me for the best part of an hour upon the subject of his\r\ngrievances against England, insisting upon it that he had been most\r\ncruelly traduced; he maintained that the barbarities of which the Belgian\r\nofficials had been accused were all lies, and, pointing to the exhibits,\r\nhe said, “How could we have obtained these results if we had been guilty\r\nof such atrocities. Is it credible that free men would come to serve us\r\nif we treated them as your press says that we do.” The words “free men”\r\ngave something to think about! My position was awkward, to say the least\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nYet although “There’s such divinity doth hedge a king,” the altar in\r\nKing Leopold’s case had long since been bereft of its sanctity; I could\r\nbut take refuge in the ambiguous truth that newspapers often deal in\r\nexaggeration, adding that the libretto of Offenbach’s _Grande Duchesse_\r\nperhaps made a mistake when it made Hortense Schneider sing: “Il faut\r\ntoujours ajouter foi à la gazette de Hollande.” The King laughed, and for\r\nthe moment the ugly corner was turned, but I had been careful not to lead\r\nhim to suppose that anybody could hold him guiltless.\r\n\r\nHis animosity against England increased with time. Five years later I\r\nwas again President at the Ghent Exhibition. This time when the foreign\r\nrepresentatives were formally presented to him, the King turned a glassy\r\neye upon me, and said: “I think I have seen you before. Was it here, or\r\ncould it have been at Bruges?” This from a King who had known me for\r\ntwenty-eight years, and had always been most friendly, and was, moreover,\r\nendowed with the royal faculty of never forgetting a face, seemed rather\r\nchilling, especially as he with obvious intent plastered my French\r\ncolleague, the Vice-President, with pretty speeches. Again I had to go\r\nround the show with him, but he never once uttered a word.\r\n\r\nKing Edward, when I told him that Sir George Holford and myself were\r\ngoing over to Ghent, very graciously wrote personally to the King, asking\r\nthat we might be allowed to visit the gardens at Laeken. King Leopold\r\ninstructed his Grand Maître de la Cour to tell me that the glass houses\r\nat Laeken were under repair, but that if, in spite of that, we “should\r\nmake a point of going,” etc., etc., etc. Needless to say we did not “make\r\na point of going.” King Edward was very much amused when I came back to\r\nLondon and told him what had happened. He recognized his Leopold, knowing\r\nfull well that the discourtesy was aimed at himself. His loving cousin\r\nwas an artist in pin-pricks.\r\n\r\nThe King was not a prepossessing person. He was a tall, thin man, during\r\nhis later years rather bent, lame, and limping with the help of a stout\r\ncane, on which he leaned heavily; yet never during a long tramp through\r\nthe Exhibition galleries showing the slightest trace of fatigue. A long\r\ngrey beard fell over his breast, masking the lower part of his face, of\r\nwhich the features were good, though his eyes were shifty and unpleasant.\r\nHe had a soft voice, but a soft voice is not always agreeable—his\r\ncertainly was not, for he had a curious, rather mincing utterance,\r\nspeaking as Agag walked—delicately, but not in such a way as to inspire\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nHe was undoubtedly a first-rate master of affairs, as General Gordon and\r\nall other men of business who had dealings with him well knew; such a man\r\nonce told me that King Leopold was the shrewdest financier whom he had\r\never come across; yet with all his cleverness he left behind him a tangle\r\nof affairs, public and private, which in no creditable fashion became a\r\nfat oyster for the lawyers of his country to wrangle over.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing for the world that he died when he did. Had he\r\nlived till now, Belgium would hardly have played the heroic part which\r\nshe did in August and September, 1914. It is whispered—indeed, it is an\r\nopen secret—that documentary evidence exists to show that King Leopold\r\nwas deeply engaged to Germany, and that he was prepared, not without\r\nreward, to allow Germany to invade France through Belgium. Sir Robert\r\nWalpole once said that every man has his price, the only difficulty being\r\nto ascertain what that price is. In King Leopold’s case the problem was\r\neasy. Not in vain had he studied the story of Danaë, and the penetrative\r\npowers of the shower of gold were familiar to him!\r\n\r\nHappily at the critical moment of her direst need, Belgium has been\r\nblessed with a King worthy of her own heroism, a King indeed of the\r\nBelgians, _primus inter pares_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1901\r\n\r\nWhen we celebrated our silver wedding on the 31st of January, 1899, we\r\nhad the rare happiness of seeing around us our nine children, all safe\r\nand sound. That, alas! can never happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n1903 AND 1905\r\n\r\nI have dealt elsewhere with the death of Queen Victoria and with the\r\ncoronation of King Edward. I have also spoken of the part played by the\r\nKing in foreign affairs: I feel inclined to say one more word upon that\r\nsubject here. In the spring of 1903, the year after the coronation, the\r\nKing had made up his mind to visit his friend the King of Portugal, and\r\nafterwards to go to Paris. It was a poorly kept secret, well known to all\r\nthose who were in any way behind the scenes at the time, that the King’s\r\nministers were very much averse to his paying those visits officially\r\nas King of England; they would have preferred that he should travel as\r\nBaron Renfrew, or Duke of Rothesay, or under any of those titles by\r\nwhich kings and queens are wont, ostrich-like, to hide their absolutely\r\npatent incognito. The Government dreaded any ceremonial on account of the\r\nunpopularity which had been carefully worked up abroad against England\r\nat the end of the Boer War. In France, moreover, the ill-will caused\r\nby the Fashoda business was supposed to be still rankling. Ministers\r\nwere afraid lest some affront should be offered to the King which might\r\nlead to diplomatic complications. His Majesty, however, with that\r\nperfect confidence in himself which distinguished him, was determined\r\nthat his first visits to Lisbon and Paris after his coronation should\r\nbe marked by all the ceremonial due to his exalted position. As the\r\nFrench statesman whom I have already quoted in a former chapter, said:\r\n“Il savait ce qu’il pouvait oser.” The visit to Lisbon was a brilliant\r\nsuccess. The King was received with acclamation and his popularity was\r\nboundless; it could not be otherwise; but ministers were still nervous\r\nabout the reception with which he might meet at Paris. They desired\r\nthat all official demonstrations should be waived and that he should be\r\nreceived with no more ceremony than might be accorded to a traveller of\r\ndistinction; they even suggested that there should be no Presidential\r\nbanquet, though they did not object to an informal luncheon(!), but that\r\nwas the utmost which, so far as they were concerned, they were prepared\r\nto consider permissible. The King put his foot down and would submit to\r\nno restriction. He was King of England, and as King of England he would\r\nenter Paris, in the full assurance that he would meet with a worthy\r\nwelcome. Sir Edward Monson, who was at that time Ambassador at Paris, and\r\nwho was to meet him at some half-way station, was urged to advise the\r\nKing, on reaching Paris, to make a speech which should tend to conciliate\r\nthose who might be less amiably disposed. His Majesty gave the Ambassador\r\nto understand that he knew quite well what he was about, and that he was\r\nnot afraid of the responsibility which he had taken upon himself. When\r\nParis was reached the reception at the station was perfectly polite and\r\ncourteous, but quite cold, lacking any sign of enthusiasm. This I was\r\ntold by a French friend who was present.\r\n\r\nNow for the transformation scene. The King drove straight to the Embassy,\r\nwhere he received a deputation from the British Chamber of Commerce.\r\nIn reply to their address, he made a speech in which he took occasion,\r\nin those gracious terms of which he was such a master, to express his\r\nfeelings of friendship for France and his love of Paris, speaking of the\r\njoy that it was to him to find himself once more among the Parisians as\r\none of themselves. The words uttered by him circulated like wildfire,\r\nand from that moment any gloom that there might have been (and indeed\r\nwas) had been dispelled, and the sun shone over a friendship which paved\r\nthe way for historic results. No honest man would attempt to detract\r\nfrom the merits due to Lord Lansdowne and the ministers who cemented and\r\nnursed the good understanding between France and England. No honest man\r\ncan say that their efforts were not greatly helped by the charm and the\r\ntact which achieved so marvellous a popularity, and smoothed away so many\r\nasperities.\r\n\r\nNor were these efforts of King Edward’s mere flashes in the pan, born of\r\nephemeral excitement or the thirst for personal popularity that would\r\nhave been utterly foreign to his keen, eager mind. They were strenuous\r\nattempts to exert in the cause of peace all those powers of fascination\r\nwith which he had been so generously gifted. He knew full well how potent\r\na factor for good or for evil the attitude of a king could be in public\r\naffairs. He felt himself to be in the highest sense the representative\r\nof his country, and he was determined to spare no effort, to shirk no\r\ndetail, in his endeavours to improve its position in the world. That was\r\nwith him the first and foremost consideration.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the famous first visit to Paris as crowned King came one\r\nof the first results of the “Entente.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT OF THE FRENCH FLEET IN 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1905 will always be memorable in the annals of the Royal Yacht\r\nSquadron, that greatest of all clubs, of which King Edward was, and King\r\nGeorge now is, the Admiral. In that year the friendly understanding\r\nbetween France and England, so happily conceived and so charged with\r\ndestiny, was celebrated by two meetings between the fleets of the\r\ntwo countries. The first of these took place at Brest, and it was\r\narranged that the return visit should be at Cowes during the regatta\r\nweek. The King also settled that the French Admiral and his principal\r\nofficers should be entertained officially—or perhaps I ought to say\r\nsemi-officially—at luncheon by the Royal Yacht Squadron on the 8th of\r\nAugust. It was certainly a unique and important occasion as being the\r\nfirst time that the club had been used as the scene of an international\r\npolitical banquet, and the gathering was worthy of it.\r\n\r\nIt was the command of the King, who took the greatest interest in all the\r\ndetails of the reception, that I should be the speaker to welcome our\r\nguests. Lord Ormonde, our Commodore, was in the chair, the Duke of Leeds,\r\nas Vice-Commodore, facing him. Besides Admiral Caillard and his officers,\r\nwe had as guests the French Ambassador, M. Paul Cambon, Sir Francis\r\nBertie, now Lord Bertie, our Ambassador at Paris, Sir John Fisher, First\r\nSea Lord of the Admiralty, now Lord Fisher, and, of course, all the\r\nprincipal members of the Squadron. After the toasts of the King and the\r\nPresident of the Republic had been proposed by the Commodore, I had to\r\nperform my rather difficult duty. My speech was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Messieurs, J’obéis à l’appel de notre Commodore. La tâche\r\n    qu’il m’a imposée serait bien difficile, bien au-dessus de\r\n    mon courage, n’étais-je sûr de pouvoir compter d’un côté\r\n    sur la bienveillance et sur l’indulgence de nos hôtes, et\r\n    si de l’autre je ne savais pas que ce sera à l’unanimité, à\r\n    l’unanimité enthousiaste, que mes collègues acclameront sinon\r\n    mes pauvres paroles, au moins les sentiments dont elles seront\r\n    la faible expression.\r\n\r\n    “Messieurs, nous célébrons aujourd’hui une occasion rare dans\r\n    l’histoire des pays—unique dans celle de notre cercle quoiqu’il\r\n    soit bientôt séculaire. Jamais ces vieux murs lézardés n’ont\r\n    assisté à pareille fête. Humbles amateurs, nous avons l’honneur\r\n    de recevoir chez nous les grands professionnels des deux plus\r\n    importantes marines du monde. Mais ce n’est pas tout—il y a\r\n    mieux que cela.\r\n\r\n    “Depuis neuf cents ans il n’y a pas eu d’invasion de\r\n    l’Angleterre. Nous en avons été menacés mainte fois. Les\r\n    Espagnols l’ont tentée. Les plongeurs fouillent jusqu’à\r\n    nos jours parmi les épaves de leur flotte, englouttie par\r\n    les vagues il y a près de quatre siècles. Les Hollandais\r\n    ont voulu recommencer la partie; cela ne leur a pas mieux\r\n    réussi. Aujourd’hui, trève de forfanterie, Messieurs, trève\r\n    de vantardise! Depuis hier l’invasion de l’Angleterre est un\r\n    fait accompli, et c’est à bras ouverts que nous accueillons\r\n    nos envahisseurs. Car il ne s’agit pas d’une invasion hostile,\r\n    mais d’une invasion d’amis, d’une invasion de cœurs battant à\r\n    l’unisson avec les nôtres. Les bouches à feu ont parlé, mais\r\n    cela n’a été que pour saluer de part et d’autre le Tricolor et\r\n    l’Union Jack.\r\n\r\n    “Messieurs, il n’en a pas toujours été ainsi. Proches voisines,\r\n    la France et l’Angleterre ont eu leurs jalousies, leur\r\n    querelles, et leurs hostilités. Entre voisines c’est bien\r\n    permis; c’est même, dit-on, d’usage. Mais nous avons changé\r\n    tout cela! Nous avons trouvé notre chemin de Damas, et c’est\r\n    notre auguste Souverain qui nous y a conduits. Aimant son\r\n    pays avant tout, travaillant sans relâche pour le bien de son\r\n    peuple, le Roi a gardé néanmoins, je le sais, un petit coin\r\n    bien chaud dans son cœur pour la France.\r\n\r\n    “C’est grâce à son initiative, admirablement secondée\r\n    d’ailleurs par Monsieur le Président de la République, par\r\n    les Ministres et par les Ambassadeurs des deux pays, que nous\r\n    montrons aujourd’hui au monde entier le spectacle de deux\r\n    grandes nations marchant comme deux bonnes sœurs, la main dans\r\n    la main, vers le même noble but—la paix—c’est-à-dire vers le\r\n    progrès, la civilisation et le bonheur de l’humanité.\r\n\r\n    “C’est pour cela que nous sommes fiers et heureux, Amiral, de\r\n    voir vos beaux cuirassés amarrés dans cette rade historique.\r\n    Formidables engins de guerre, ils sont ici Missionnaires de la\r\n    Paix, venus pour mettre le dernier sceau au pacte d’une amitié\r\n    qui nous est bien chère, d’une amitié saine, loyale, et combien\r\n    desirée par tous ceux qui ont à cœur les intérêts des deux pays!\r\n\r\n    “Que cette amitié soit durable, qu’aucune jalousie, aucune\r\n    intrigue ne vienne la troubler—voilà, je me plais à croire, le\r\n    vœu intime et sincère de tous ceux qui m’entendent.\r\n\r\n    “Messieurs, je crains d’avoir abusé de votre patience, aussi\r\n    vais-je me taire. Mais avant de m’asseoir je vous prie,\r\n    Messieurs mes collègues de l’Escadre Royale, de remplir vos\r\n    verres, et de boire avec moi à la santé de l’amiral Caillard,\r\n    à celle des officiers distingués dont il est entouré, et à la\r\n    gloire impérissable de la Marine Française.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral Caillard then rose and made the following reply:\r\n\r\n    “Tous, ici, nous partageons les sentiments exprimés par Lord\r\n    Redesdale. Nous sommes charmés de l’accueil sympathique qui\r\n    nous a été reservé au Royal Yacht Squadron Club, et cette\r\n    impression, s’ajoutant à celle des marques d’amitié que nous\r\n    donnèrent la flotte de l’Atlantique à Brest et, hier, la flotte\r\n    de la Manche, les graveront dans notre souvenir d’une façon\r\n    indélébile.\r\n\r\n    “Je bois à la santé du Royal Yacht Squadron Club.”\r\n\r\nThat night the French Admiral gave a reception on board his flagship, at\r\nwhich the King was present. There was cordial talk of the luncheon at the\r\nCastle, which had given the French Fleet great pleasure and no little\r\nsatisfaction to the King.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon of Wednesday, 9th August, His Majesty the King\r\nreviewed the French Fleet, which subsequently at 1 p.m. weighed anchor\r\nand proceeded to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nIn London there was a great luncheon in Westminster Hall given by\r\nboth Houses of Parliament with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, in\r\nthe chair. The French officers were also entertained at one of those\r\nmagnificent feasts for which the hospitality of the City is world-famous,\r\nand this furnished the occasion for what was one of the noblest\r\nexpressions of chivalrous feeling that could be conceived. It aroused\r\ngreat and admiring enthusiasm at the time, but in the course of years\r\nthese things are forgotten, and the French visit is worth recording here\r\nif for no other reason. When the procession of carriages passed through\r\nTrafalgar Square, where a great crowd had gathered, Admiral Caillard\r\nstood up in his landau, turned to the column, and with great dignity\r\nsaluted the statue of Nelson. All the officers of his following did the\r\nsame. It touched England to the quick, and even now, after the lapse of\r\nten years, I cannot tell the tale without emotion. Could that knightly\r\ninspiration, so gracefully carried out, have been bettered?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1905 King Edward did us the honour of paying us a\r\nvisit at Batsford; it was the fulfilment of an old promise, and on the\r\n8th of July he arrived. The King was an enthusiastic gardener, and for\r\nmany years I had the honour of sharing with him in what, in a letter to\r\na friend, he once described as his favourite pursuit. At Sandringham,\r\nBuckingham Palace, Windsor and Balmoral he never wearied of walking about\r\nwith Sir Dighton Probyn, another fanatic worshipper of the great god Pan,\r\nand myself, planning or listening to plans for improvements.\r\n\r\nAmong the guests who were to meet his Majesty we had invited two great\r\nhorticulturists, Mr. Chamberlain, whose special cult was that of orchids,\r\nand Georgina, Countess of Dudley, whose skill and care converted a\r\nhopeless jungle into one of the loveliest pleasaunces that could provoke\r\na poet’s song. The King brought with him Sir George Holford, the greatest\r\nof all English gardeners—so there was much flower talk. When the King\r\narrived I was rather taken aback, for almost the first thing that he said\r\nto me was, “Now I must warn you that I will not go up a hill”—with a\r\ngreat stress on the _not_. This was rather a blow, for such merit as the\r\ngarden at Batsford possesses is due to the fact that it is nothing but a\r\nhill, and indeed a pretty steep one. However, it was a lovely afternoon,\r\nand we all sallied forth. Presently, when we came to a turn leading\r\nupward, the King began wandering on and so, led by one view or grouping\r\nof plants after another that took his fancy, he climbed and climbed until\r\nhe had reached the furthest and highest point.\r\n\r\nThe next day was taken up with church and a long drive to Stanway over\r\nthe Cotswold Hills, which I was eager to show him, and so he saw Campden,\r\nBroadway and some of the picturesque neighbouring villages with their old\r\nseventeenth-century houses dating from a time before the grazing country\r\nwas broken up during the Napoleonic wars, owing to the boom in wheat—a\r\ntime when every man was a flock-master and every good-wife span. When the\r\nplough came, the old houses, so full of architectural charm, were divided\r\nup to furnish labourers’ cottages. The King was very much pleased with\r\nthis view of a part of his dominions that was new to him, and he was loud\r\nin his admiration of Inigo Jones’s beautiful work at Stanway, where Lord\r\nand Lady Elcho gave him tea.\r\n\r\nBut my triumph as a gardener was complete when on the Monday the King put\r\noff his return to London till midday so that he might once more walk up\r\nthe hill, which, at first, he had declared to be _tabu_.\r\n\r\nThe King’s visit was not only a great honour for us, but it gave immense\r\npleasure to a great many of his loyal subjects to whom, living as they do\r\nin a rather out-of-the-way part of the country, kings and queens had, up\r\nto that time, been like the gods of Olympus, mystic beings, venerated but\r\nunseen. The last king that had been seen in Moreton-in-Marsh was Charles\r\nthe First. The room in which the Martyr King slept is still shown at the\r\nWhite Hart.\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, 1905, the King sent for me and told me that he\r\nwas about to send the Garter to the Emperor of Japan, that Prince Arthur\r\nof Connaught was to take it, and that it was his Majesty’s wish that I\r\nshould go with the Mission. Of course I was only too glad to obey. We\r\nstarted in January, 1906, on what turned out to be a most delightful\r\nexpedition, a success in every way. The voyage out with halts at Aden,\r\nCeylon, Singapore, and Hong Kong was full of interest. The Prince played\r\nhis part admirably and the return journey through Canada gave me an\r\nimpression of that richly blest country which can never be forgotten. I\r\nhave already published an account of “the Garter Mission to Japan,” so I\r\nneed say no more about it here.\r\n\r\nBefore we left for Japan the King did me the honour of conferring upon me\r\nthe Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and when I came home I was\r\ngiven the K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n1908-9\r\n\r\nThe King’s relations with the Emperor of Russia had always been of the\r\nmost friendly and even affectionate character. As Tsarevitch the Emperor\r\npaid a visit to Sandringham, and the near relationship to Queen Alexandra\r\nhad been kept very much alive by those family parties in Denmark at which\r\nKing Christian’s sons and daughters with their husbands and children\r\nwere wont to keep up a patriarchal kinship. No family was ever united\r\nby stronger ties of love and affection than that of the Danish King and\r\nQueen, and those bonds were never allowed to slacken. It was only natural\r\ntherefore that our King and Queen should wish to pay a visit to their\r\nnephew in his own country.\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg was then not in such a condition politically as to\r\nwarrant their going there, so the meeting took place at Reval in the\r\nmonth of June. The visit was purely dictated by family affection, and\r\nthere was not the most distant suspicion of politics attached to it.\r\nThere were, however, a few—happily very few—ill-conditioned members\r\nof Parliament who chose to assume that the King, by going to Reval,\r\nwas more or less giving a sign of approval to the severity with which\r\nrebels were said to be treated in Russia, a severity, by the by, which\r\nhas since been shown to have been greatly exaggerated. The professional\r\nagitator seldom allows himself to be hampered by accuracy. The German\r\nPress also took exception to this meeting, and held it up as evidence\r\nof a dark and sinister anti-Teuton plot. It is really amazing that\r\nthe King should have been suspected of hatred against Germany. Nothing\r\ncould be further from the truth, as I have good reason to know. The King\r\ndelighted in his yearly visits to Germany; he loved the country where\r\nhe had many friends, not to speak of his near relations; he delighted\r\nin his intercourse with them, which was greatly facilitated by his\r\nexceptional knowledge of their language, in which he took some pride in\r\nexercising his skill; and yet the newspaper writers, who in Germany seem\r\nto be a singularly ill-informed race, were never weary of girding at the\r\nKing and proclaiming a hostility which was purely the invention of a\r\nmischief-making spite.\r\n\r\nAll this had the effect of irritating him; he could not see why he might\r\nnot give a token of affection to a near relation without being called\r\nover the coals by a section of his own people, and held up by foreign\r\npressmen to the hatred of a nation for which, as he had shown throughout\r\nhis life, he entertained nothing but the friendliest feelings. The King\r\nshowed his just displeasure by excluding from his invitations to a garden\r\nparty at Windsor the Members of Parliament who had attacked him. In that\r\nhe did no more than any private gentleman would have done. No gentleman\r\ninvites to his house a man who has offered him a public affront for which\r\nno apology has been offered. Is the King to be the only man in his realm\r\nwho must allow who will to insult him unchallenged and unrebuked? Yet\r\nthere were people who blamed him. In my humble judgment he did right.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1909, the Emperor Nicholas paid the King\r\na return visit at Cowes in his yacht, the _Standart_. There was a\r\nbrilliant gathering for the regatta week, and the King gave more than one\r\nentertainment in his nephew’s honour. I had the honour to be invited to a\r\ngreat banquet on board the _Victoria and Albert_, and after dinner had a\r\nlong talk with the Emperor, who asked many questions about the old days\r\nat St. Petersburg in his grandfather’s time. He was obviously very much\r\ndelighted with his reception, and was graciously pleased to accede to a\r\nsuggestion which I made by the King’s command that he should become a\r\nmember of the Marlborough Club.\r\n\r\nAgain the agitators snarled and sneered at the visit, but M. Isvolsky,\r\nwho was with the Tsar, very tactfully said that the protest only served\r\nto accentuate the cordiality of the welcome by the people. Nothing came\r\nof what was an ugly piece of discourtesy on the part of some men who\r\nshould have known better; and the Emperor sailed away from Cowes on the\r\n5th of August, leaving behind him in the minds of all those who had had\r\nthe good fortune to meet him a happy memory of a truly royal geniality\r\nand kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nBAYREUTH IN 1912\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1912 I received an invitation from Herr Siegfried Wagner to be present\r\nat the _General-Probe_ (dress rehearsal) of the Bayreuth Festival. My\r\ndaughter Iris, my usual travelling companion, went with me.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain quaint charm, an individuality, about the old German\r\ntowns that once upon a time, in days which are after all not so very\r\nremote, were the seats of small princely Courts and Governments. Bayreuth\r\nwas a typical example of an old “Residenz.” Broad streets flanked by\r\nsubstantial houses, squares with fountains or statues adorning their\r\ncentres, an old palace or castle—the relic of feudal times—and a more\r\nmodern palace of French eighteenth-century inspiration; outside the town\r\na “Hermitage,” with a Temple of the Sun, sham ruins and other rococo\r\nfollies built of cement plastered with mosaics of coloured stone and\r\nrock-crystal or glass, in a garden with deliciously shaded, cool walks:\r\nthese are the legacies of former glories, when the “high-well-born”\r\nwho crowded to the palace elbowed and jostled for a bow, a smile, or a\r\ngracious word from a Markgraf or a Markgräfin with all the honour-hunger\r\nof men and women in all times and in all Courts.\r\n\r\nThink of the bitterness and mortification of a lady left out from a\r\ngarden-party at the Hermitage when there were to be private theatricals\r\nin the Roman Theatre, at which Voltaire was to be stage-manager and act\r\nwith her Royal Highness in person! Think of the triumph, not untinged\r\nwith spite, of her next-door neighbour who could flaunt in her face\r\nthe coveted invitation card! Oh, it was a very real Court! There were\r\nchamberlains with their wands; ladies-in-waiting, maids-of-honour,\r\nprivy councillors, officials of all grades, an army chiefly composed\r\nof officers. There were hoop petticoats, powder and rouge and patches,\r\nred-heeled shoes, and if there were not many diamonds we may be sure that\r\nthere was plenty of paste. Just such a Court as Thackeray and Offenbach\r\nloved to make fun of, and even Frederick the Great, as we shall presently\r\nsee, made the target at which to sling his ridicule.\r\n\r\nHauff, writing in the first years of the nineteenth century, in his\r\nsardonic “Memoiren des Satans,” whom, by the by, he represents as taking\r\na special interest in the pigmy Courts, makes Satan ask the Wandering\r\nJew whether there is anything more grotesque to be seen than “diese\r\nduodez Länder,” these duodecimo countries. So it was not foreigners\r\nonly who laughed at the absurdities which they presented. However, _de\r\nmortuis nil nisi bonum_. All now vanished! Gone the transparencies,\r\ngone the chamberlains and the Court ladies, gone General Bourn and his\r\nstaff! All shades—shades that have crossed the Styx. The metamorphosis\r\nis complete. The palaces are used as museums or public offices, the\r\nhouses of the “high-well-born” are shops and places of business, the\r\nfountains, in which admiring courtiers saw the rivals of the Grandes Eaux\r\nde Versailles, play for an hour on Sundays for the benefit of honest\r\nburghers waxing fat upon their afternoon lager, as good Bavarians should,\r\nin the groves of the once exclusive Hermitage, turned by the wheel of\r\ntime into a glorified beer-garden.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of the Markgräfin Wilhelmine give a perfect, but none too\r\nattractive, picture of the little Court of Bayreuth. She was the daughter\r\nof King Frederick William of Prussia, and her mother was a Princess of\r\nHanover, sister of George the First of England. Her life as a child and\r\nas a young lady was one long misery. Her mother hated her, and the hatred\r\nwas increased by the failure of all her conspiracies to marry the girl\r\nto her first cousin, the Prince of Wales. Her father, too, had his views\r\nas to marrying her to suit his whims or interests, so that she became\r\nimmeshed in a perfect network of intrigues and plots and counterplots.\r\n\r\nFrederick William was a man of such a violent temper that one is tempted\r\nsometimes to doubt his sanity. His cruelty to his children was, even if\r\nwe largely discount the Markgräfin’s story, simply incredible. His son,\r\nafterwards Frederick the Great, when a grown-up youth, beaten, cuffed,\r\nkicked, and dragged round the room by his hair; later on arrested,\r\nthreatened with torture, and his best friend, Katt, beheaded before\r\nhis face;—Wilhelmine struck in the face with his clenched fist and\r\nhanded over to governesses who ill-used and tortured her. He was a man\r\nof no little political sagacity, and he laid the foundation upon which\r\nFrederick the Great built up the greatness of Prussia, but in his home\r\nhe was a savage utterly without control. The marriage with the Prince of\r\nWales fell through because King George very properly refused to subscribe\r\nto the King of Prussia’s conditions; the suitors favoured by the King\r\nwere sent to the right-about by Wilhelmine’s own strength of character.\r\nShe fought with her back to the wall, she won the day, and they were\r\ndismissed. And so it came to pass that at the age of twenty-two she, in\r\n1731, married the hereditary Prince of Bayreuth.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Family of Prussia were anything but a happy gathering. The\r\nKing and Queen were objects of terror so little tempered by any dutiful\r\nregard that, although Wilhelmine now and again makes little attempts at\r\nan expression of filial affection, too gushing to be real, they were\r\nrather hated than beloved by their children: the sisters were for ever\r\nquarrelling and plotting the one against the other, and as they grew\r\nup and married small Princes there was plenty of opportunity for the\r\nexhibition of petty jealousies and spite. Between Wilhelmine and her\r\nbrother, Frederick the Great, there was some show of affection, at any\r\nrate on her side, and in the days of his dire calamities she did what\r\nshe could to stand between him and the cruelty of their father; but on\r\nhis side the affection was only intermittently returned; and indeed by\r\nher own showing she can hardly have been the sort of person who would\r\narouse sympathy or attract love: clever she was, beyond a doubt—her\r\ncorrespondence with Voltaire testifies to that; but there was nothing\r\nsoft or womanly about her character.\r\n\r\nHer father-in-law, the Markgraf, was the object of her special hatred and\r\nof a contempt which she did not care to conceal. When the poor drunken\r\nfool was dying she was away at Potsdam with her father, and she received\r\nthe intelligence with undisguised pleasure. “Les nouvelles que je reçus\r\nde Bareith furent bien satisfaisantes. Mlle. de Sonsfeld me mandait que\r\nla santé du Margrave dépérissait à vue.” He did not die until two years\r\nlater, in May, 1735—a long period of waiting for a Princess who was in a\r\nhurry to be promoted to her full dignities!\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great entertained a very adequate respect for the glories\r\nof a Markgraf’s Court, nor had he the consideration for his sister’s\r\nfeelings which might have curbed his satire. When, shortly before the\r\ndeath of their father, the King of Prussia, he paid his sister a visit\r\nat Bayreuth, he seems rather to have taken pains to mortify her: “Il se\r\nfit présenter toute la Cour, et se contenta de regarder tous ceux qui\r\nla composaient d’un air moqueur, après quoi nous nous mimes à table. Il\r\nne fit dans toute la conversation que turlupiner tout ce qu’il voyait\r\nen me répétant plus de cent fois le mot de petit prince et de petite\r\nCour. J’étais outrée.” Poor little Court! But there was to be worse\r\nwithin the sacred precincts themselves than the cruellest mockery from\r\noutside. When the Princess became Markgräfin her favourite maid-of-honour\r\nwas a certain Fräulein von Marwitz, of whom in 1735 she wrote: “Pour la\r\nMarwitz je l’aimais à la passion; nous n’avions rien caché l’une pour\r\nl’autre. Je n’ai jamais vu un rapport de caractère pareil au nôtre; elle\r\nne pouvait vivre sans moi, ni moi sans elle; elle ne faisait pas un pas\r\nsans me consulter et elle était approuvée de tout le monde.” A beautiful\r\nfriendship! But alas for the inconstancy of female alliances! It was not\r\nvery long before the lovely Marwitz—for she was lovely—fulfilled her\r\ncourtly mission by setting her cap at the Markgraf, and stealing his\r\nheart from the mistress who loved her, if indeed she ever loved anybody\r\nbut herself.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, it was a very real Court. It was a centre of political\r\nintrigues; for the rivalries of Austria and Prussia kept the small\r\ncapitals of Germany in a continual fever; while, apart from greater\r\nquestions of policy, jealousies, ambitions, and heart-burnings worthy of\r\nVersailles and the Œil de Bœuf were directed upon petty promotions and\r\nevanescent favouritisms. As for the chief luminaries, they shed a light\r\nover their little firmament relatively not inferior to that of the Roi\r\nSoleil himself.\r\n\r\nThe last years of the Markgräfin’s chequered life were by far the\r\nhappiest. Their correspondence during those years shows the revival\r\nof a complete understanding between Frederick the Great and her, and\r\nbears every witness of mutual admiration. He appreciated her undoubted\r\ntalents; she sympathized with his endeavours and gloried in his success.\r\nTheir affection was warmer and more real than it had been even in their\r\nchildhood. She speaks of it with delight as a “retour de sentiments des\r\npersonnes qu’on aime.”\r\n\r\nBesides this natural source of a great joy there was also her\r\nintellectual friendship with Voltaire. She made his acquaintance in 1740\r\nat Reinsberg, a country place where the great Frederick had gathered\r\ntogether a whole assembly of men of letters and science, whom in\r\nspare moments he refreshed with his flute. Three years later Voltaire\r\naccompanied the King to Bayreuth, where he outstayed his royal patron\r\nfor a fortnight, during which he helped the Markgräfin in a whole series\r\nof entertainments and theatricals. Their correspondence, in which\r\nshe delighted, lasted till her death, upon which he wrote one of the\r\ntrashiest sonnets that ever appeared signed by a great name. The editor\r\nof her journal calls it a “monument immortel”!\r\n\r\nThe Markgräfin Wilhelmine was not only a woman of remarkable talent, but\r\nshe was a Princess typical of the times in which she lived and of the\r\nposition which she occupied. If she did not directly play a leading part\r\nin the historical events of those days, she was intimately mixed up with\r\nthose who did. She left her mark upon her husband’s principality, and it\r\nwill always be difficult to think of Bayreuth without remembering her as\r\na most notable personality in its princely family.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed; but if the tinsel of a pinchbeck Court has\r\ndisappeared, Bayreuth to-day is more brilliant and more famous than it\r\nwas in the days when the smiles or frowns of the Markgrafen and their\r\nconsorts made the Paradise or the Gehenna of their courtiers. Then the\r\nold Franconian capital could hardly have been known outside of Germany\r\nor Austria, and even there it only ranked as one of many such towns. Now\r\nthe mighty genius of one man has transformed it into the Mecca of a great\r\ncult, celebrated wherever the magic power of poetry, music, and art holds\r\nsway, drawing the willing pilgrims to its shrine.\r\n\r\nThe performance of a drama at the Fest-Spiel-Haus gives the impression\r\nof something sacred, something of the nature of a religious ceremony.\r\nAll the circumstances combine to give intensity to that idea. From the\r\nbeginning of time, ever since the Sumerians raised the Tower of Babel,\r\nas we are now told to imitate the sacred pinnacles of the highlands from\r\nwhich they swept down upon the Mesopotamian plain; long before Babylon\r\nor Nineveh were cities, hills and mountains in every country have been\r\nplaces of worship. Mount Zion, Sinai, Carmel, Ararat, Olympus, Fuji in\r\nfar Japan, a thousand peaks in a thousand lands tell the same tale.\r\nOutside the town of Bayreuth, at a distance of perhaps half a mile is\r\na little hill, and upon this fitting site is erected the Temple of\r\nthe great High Priest of Art. An avenue of horse-chestnut trees some\r\nthirty years old, that have just reached the dignity of giving a little\r\nwelcome shade, leads up to it. And here on a day when one of the great\r\nmasterpieces is to be played, for a full hour before the given time you\r\nmay see a long stream of the faithful toiling up under broiling sun or\r\npouring rain, careless of either, only eager to be in time when the\r\ntrumpet shall sound to tell that the doors are open. Laggards there are\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe Fest-Spiel-Haus (call it not a theatre!) is a very simple,\r\nunpretentious building: it is guiltless of all ornamentation both outside\r\nand inside: a covered verandah for shelter runs round it, but there is\r\nnothing superfluous, no pillars or gewgaws or caryatides, nothing to\r\nconvey an idea of the feast of poetry that will presently be opened. Only\r\nthe rapt look in the faces of the worshippers tells of expectancy and\r\nthe knowledge of the joy to come. It is the expression which may be read\r\nin the features of a pious Mussulman when at eventide he kneels on his\r\nprayer-carpet and turns his face towards the holy city of his faith; it\r\nis a look that you may see in a procession of poor Russian pilgrims when\r\nthey come in sight of the walls of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIn their appreciations of other men’s writings professed critics,\r\nespecially when their desire is to praise, are often led into\r\nmetaphysical analyses in which subtleties are discovered at which no one\r\ncould be more astonished than the authors to whom they are ascribed.\r\nWhen Pope was attacked by Crousaz for the heterodox opinions put forth\r\nin the “Essay on Man,” Bishop Warburton, who, by the by, had previously\r\nhimself fallen foul of the poet for the same reason, took up the cudgels\r\nfor him, professing to have discovered certain hidden meanings which had\r\npreviously escaped him. Pope in his gratitude wrote: “You understand my\r\nwork better than I do myself.” We almost feel that there is just a little\r\ntinge of perhaps unconscious satire in his gratitude.\r\n\r\nMuch has in this same analytical way been read into Wagner’s work by his\r\nadmirers and disciples. Yet there was no need for it, for the Tone-Poet\r\nhas himself told us of the motives and ideas which were at work in his\r\nbrain when he gradually gave birth to his great inventive conception, the\r\nTone-Drama.[49] But even when Wagner himself becomes his own interpreter\r\nwe prefer the work to the interpretation; for that is apt to be as\r\ncryptic to the average reader as St. Peter found the epistles of “our\r\nbeloved brother Paul”—“in which are some things hard to be understood,\r\nwhich they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the\r\nother scriptures, unto their own destruction.”\r\n\r\nA great work of art, as it seems to me, needs no interpreter. If a poem,\r\na picture, or a musical composition fails to touch me, then I think that\r\nthere must be something lacking, either in my power of apprehension, or\r\nin the work of art itself. In neither case will the interpreter be able\r\nto fill the gap. If my senses or my understanding are hard, he cannot\r\nsoften them. If the work is faulty, all the preaching in the world will\r\nnot make it right. The true test of a work of art is its power of appeal.\r\nThe master is the man who can make his fellow-men thrill with pleasure or\r\nshiver with horror; if he needs a third person to explain his meaning,\r\nthen he is no true artist, and his work is for the scrap-heap. Wagner\r\nwas essentially above all men of his time the one master who could stir\r\nthe feelings of those whom he addressed, the one man who could make\r\nhis own art an article of faith in others. To split hairs as to the\r\nwhy and the wherefore of his power, to read into his work metaphysical\r\nintentions, appears to me to be unnecessary and trivial, and therefore\r\nalmost a sacrilege. If by all the analyses and verbiage with which he\r\nhas been plastered you could educate other Wagners there would be some\r\njustification for them; but you cannot make Wagners, and his imitators\r\nhave been without exception wretched failures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the relation of the mental processes by which he\r\narrived at his great invention of the Tone-Drama is a psychological\r\nstudy of absorbing interest, and a story of profound significance in the\r\nhistory of art. Most of the commentators are long and wearisome beyond\r\nwords—especially is this the case with some of the lesser Germans. Would\r\nthey but lay to heart old Hesiod’s warning, νήπιοι οὔδ’ ἴσασιν πλέον\r\nἥμισυ πάντος. Children! and they know now how much better the half than\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nRichard Wagner was but six months old when his father, Friedrich, died.\r\nHe was a registrar of police in Leipzig, a man of a culture far above\r\nthe ordinary level of his humble official position. By the law he won\r\nhis bread, but his heart was in the theatre, and it was owing to him\r\nthat his friend, Ludwig Geyer, painter and actor, who had himself been\r\neducated for the law, definitely adopted the stage as his profession, in\r\nwhich he attained a great success. A few months after Friedrich’s death,\r\nthis Geyer, a good and worthy man, married the widow and devoted himself\r\nwith all a parent’s affectionate care to little Richard, who knew no\r\nother father, and loved him dearly. But the tender relationship did not\r\nlast long. Before Richard was nine years old Frau Geyer was again left\r\na widow. “She was a good wife and mother,” we are told, “and her son\r\nidolized her. The memory of her love supported him in all the storms of\r\nhis life, and he was talking of her on the evening before his death.”\r\n\r\nAfter Geyer’s loss she seems to have been the centre of a small literary,\r\nartistic, and theatrical coterie which met at her house, and in these\r\nsurroundings Richard Wagner’s childhood budded and bloomed. For him in\r\nhis earliest days the theatre was everything—always the theatre. He was\r\nthe constant companion and playmate of his stepfather, who carried the\r\nchild with him even to rehearsals. Indeed, the whole family was bitten\r\nby the stage-craze. His eldest brother, brought up to be a doctor,\r\nthrew away pills and potions and lancet, and became an actor; his three\r\nsisters followed the same bent: what wonder that this child, full of\r\nimagination and poetic fancy, brought up in the glare of the footlights,\r\nshould catch the contagious fever which was burning up all those near and\r\ndear to him? Even in the next generation the flame was still blazing.\r\nThe voice and acting of his niece Johanna is yet a glorious memory among\r\nthe very oldest opera-goers, and his son Siegfried, an architect by\r\nprofession, has found his true vocation in the direction of the Bayreuth\r\ntheatre, and is known as himself a composer of operas.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic impulse was vibrating in every fibre of Richard’s nature. By\r\nthe time he was sixteen he had completed a tragedy suggested partly by\r\n_King Lear_, partly by _Hamlet_, inspired wholly by heredity. And here\r\nwas laid the foundation of that dramatic art which was destined to bring\r\na new revelation to the world. He was a Poet—above all things a Poet; but\r\nit was borne in upon him that the message of the Poet must be incomplete\r\nas a language speaking to the soul unless it were united to the mystery\r\nof another power; that power was music, and of music he knew nothing, or\r\nno more than what enabled him to play the piano by ear.\r\n\r\nBut he felt his vocation. Listen to what he says of those early days.\r\n“Whilst I was finishing my great Tragedy I for the first time became\r\nacquainted with Beethoven’s music at the concerts of the Gewandhaus at\r\nLeipzig; its impression upon me was all-powerful; with Mozart, too, I\r\nmade friends, especially through his _Requiem_. Beethoven’s incidental\r\nmusic for _Egmont_ inspired me so that for nothing in the world would I\r\nlet my finished Tragedy leave the stocks until it should be furnished\r\nwith similar music. Without a moment’s hesitation I felt confident that\r\nI could myself write this all-important music, but still thought well\r\nfirst to furnish myself with a few chief rules of thorough-bass. In order\r\nto achieve this as far as possible, I obtained a week’s loan of Logier’s\r\n‘Methode des General-basses,’ and worked at it zealously. But the study\r\ndid not bear fruit so quickly as I had thought. Its difficulties charmed\r\nand riveted me; I determined to become a musician.” And this, remember,\r\nwas a boy of sixteen. Icarus himself, harnessing the horses of the Sun,\r\nwas not more audacious. But Wagner was not to share the fate of Icarus.\r\n\r\nI remember how once when a lady consulted Lord Leighton about her boy,\r\nwho showed a great talent for painting, his answer was: “Let him have the\r\neducation of a gentleman in the first place, then, if he should still\r\nhave an inclination for art, let him specialize.” The story of Wagner\r\nshows the wisdom of those words. His biographer tells us how greatly\r\nWagner profited by his classical education, and he points out what an\r\nuntold advantage this gave him over the other great musical writers, such\r\nas Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck. Had Mozart, for instance, as he suggests,\r\nbeen kept at school instead of being trotted out as an infant phenomenon\r\nat Courts and in the palaces of great nobles, would he have allied the\r\ngenius of his music to such piteous libretti as those with which he had\r\nto be satisfied? Is it not possible that in him, as in Wagner, the poet\r\nmight have been united with the composer?\r\n\r\nIn Wagner, as we have seen, the poet came first, then the musician: the\r\neducation of the gentleman was the dominant influence. During his school\r\nand college life he showed such a predilection for language that his\r\nmasters thought that he would become a great philological professor. They\r\nmissed the point that it was language in the singular, not in the plural,\r\nthat fascinated him: he had not the gift of tongues, nor did he take any\r\nspecial interest in comparative philology, but the power of expression,\r\nthe poet’s power, inspired his music, in the same way that his music\r\ngave birth to his poetry. The two wedded made him unique. Without his\r\nclassical education, which opened out to him Homer, Æschylus, Sophocles,\r\nand drove him to learn English in order that he might enjoy Shakespeare\r\nuntranslated, the two could never have grown to the noble stature which\r\nthey assumed; possibly they might never have been born.\r\n\r\nTo dwell upon the wretchedness, the poverty, the hunger, the crushed\r\nhopes of many years, to recall the miseries of a union with a wife who,\r\nfull of good intentions as she was, neither understood him nor believed\r\nin the ultimate victory of his mighty genius—to think of Wagner, “the\r\nmost German of all artists,” banished from the Fatherland which he loved\r\nso passionately, eating such bitter bread of sorrow that one cannot\r\nat this distance of time read the story without emotion—all this is\r\nonly so far necessary to an understanding of Bayreuth as it shows the\r\nindomitable courage of the hero.\r\n\r\nThat he should have lived through the tragic days of Paris and Zurich\r\nis little short of miraculous. Happily better times were in store for\r\nhim. He was able to come back to Germany. Poor Minna Planer, from whom\r\nhe had been separated for many years, died in 1866. Death severed a tie\r\nthat must have been intolerable to both. Marriage must be a vengeance of\r\ndevils or a reward of the gods. Wagner tasted both, for in his second\r\nmarriage he found all the comfort, the agreement, and the faith in him\r\nwhich had been lacking in the first.\r\n\r\nMinna Planer, the actress wife, had been nothing but a hindrance, a\r\nmillstone round the eager man’s neck. To be the helpmeet of a prophet,\r\na seer, a man of genius, a woman must above all things believe in her\r\nhusband, in his power to dominate men, in the magnetism of his will. What\r\nwould Mohammed have been without the faith of Khadijah, who trusted him\r\nwhen even his own relations cried “Fool” and “Madman”? Prince Siddartha\r\ndeserted his wife and her babe to wander into the wilderness in search\r\nof wisdom, but sweet Yasodhara bore him no grudge, for she had faith in\r\nhis mission, and when at last he became Buddha she joined the company of\r\nbelievers and followed his teaching. This is the sort of trust that it\r\nwas not in the nature of Minna to give. Her commonplace soul could not\r\nunderstand his impatience of the bonds of convention, or the wild flights\r\nof his soaring imagination. How he must have fretted under the galling\r\nrestraint! How the sword must have strained to leap from the scabbard!\r\n\r\nHappily the last years of his life were blessed by the loving care and\r\nsympathy of Cosima, the daughter of his best friend, Franz Liszt—a wife\r\nrare among women, whose soul and heart were in unison with his own—and\r\ncheered by watching the growth of children whom he adored, reared in the\r\nhome which he had made beautiful for their joy. But this is no attempt to\r\ngive even the thinnest outline of the Master’s life. For a biography and\r\nfor a complete study of his work the curious must go to the fountain head.\r\n\r\nFrom such study we may learn much. We hear wild talk about Wagner’s\r\n“operas”: it would be well that we should arrive at some understanding\r\nas to how far he may be said to have composed “operas” at all—that is to\r\nsay, “operas” in the old accepted sense of the word. Probably the best\r\nway of facing the problem will be to take refuge in a compromise.\r\n\r\nThe Master’s life has been divided into two equal halves—the first\r\nlasting from his birth in 1813 to 1848, the year of those political\r\ntroubles in which he became so unhappily involved; the second from 1848\r\nto his death in 1883. His creative activity began when he was yet a\r\nchild—we have seen how when he was but sixteen years old he had completed\r\nhis “great tragedy,” which taught him that music was essential to drama,\r\nthat the language of the senses must find its complement in the language\r\nof the soul, that music alone can appeal to the fancy and the imagination\r\nas poetry does to the reason.\r\n\r\nThis of course at once throws down the gauntlet to argument: no poet\r\nthat ever lived has been gifted with the musical faculty as was Richard\r\nWagner, yet who can assert that Shakespeare, Dante, that great prose poet\r\nCervantes, were not kings over the fancy and imagination of mankind?\r\nCan they be said to be incomplete because their works were not wedded\r\nto music? Still this was the principle which was the guiding beacon of\r\nthe Wagnerian inspiration, and from that he never steered aside. The\r\narguments of enthusiasm are sometimes hard to follow. We are warned that\r\nwe must not look upon Wagner “as a poet and a musician as if he were in\r\nsome monstrous way gifted with two extraordinary talents, but that the\r\nyearning for music in the deepest and most hidden depths underlies the\r\npoetical impulse, and that music which then pours forth from the poetry\r\nlike perfume from the leaves and flowers of trees, is in very truth the\r\ninforming though unseen sap of this tree.”\r\n\r\nHere, we are told, is the key to the understanding of this poet. And\r\nyet we have seen that the boy was first of all a poet, and that it\r\nwas the poetic faculty which called forth the musical faculty! I find\r\nit difficult to reconcile the two ideas. Apart from the merits of his\r\nwork, the great gulf which separates him from all other composers lies\r\nin the fact that whereas before him there have been great poets and\r\ngreat musicians—Shakespeare, Dante, Milton, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart,\r\nGluck, and others—it was in Wagner that for the first time the genius of\r\nmusic and the genius of poetry were united. But it was not until he had\r\ndiscovered his power in poetry that his power in music was revealed to\r\nhim. This seems to me unanswerable. But there is further evidence to be\r\nbrought forward in the shape of his own _Frederick Barbarossa_. Here was\r\na work which, when he had completed it, he found to be unsuited to music:\r\nit failed to inspire him and so it remained unwedded. That teaches us\r\nmuch in regard to the relationship between poetry and music in Wagner—not\r\nall poetry was to be expressed in music. We must return to this question\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe works of the first half of Wagner’s life were operas in the strict\r\nsense of the word. That they differed from all existing operas is\r\ncertain, but that was no more than would be expected from their genesis\r\nand their author. So do Rossini’s operas differ from Mozart’s,—the whole\r\nItalian school from the German. _Die Feen_ and _Das Liebesverbot_,\r\nfounded on Shakespeare’s _Measure for Measure_; _Rienzi_ and _The Flying\r\nDutchman_, _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_ (surely the most entrancing of\r\nall romantic operas), _Siegfried’s Death_, can have no other title;\r\nand—apart from _Barbarossa_, which had no claim to it—they make up the\r\nsum of the theatrical work executed before 1848. Wagner, writing for the\r\nstage, found the model in existence and adopted it. Even the strictest\r\nof his disciples admit this. Indeed how can they deny what he himself\r\nasserted?\r\n\r\nThose were hard times. But music which had come at the Poet’s call\r\nfurnished him a scanty means of life as Kapellmeister. Then came 1848\r\nand banishment, days of still greater stress and need, and misery\r\nindescribable, when only the dreariest drudgery of a music-seller’s hack\r\nkept body and soul together. Yet those were the days when he threw off\r\nthe last shackles of conventionality and gave to the world the newly born\r\nidea of the Tone-Drama. That was the time when he first found himself and\r\nopened the wings of his mighty genius, soaring into regions which no man\r\nbefore him had dared or indeed been able to attempt.\r\n\r\nThe unsuitability to music of his _Barbarossa_ had opened out a new\r\nconviction in the Tone-Poet’s mind. Music and poetry must go hand in\r\nhand; the idea of writing music to another man’s verse—that is to say,\r\nto command—was intolerable to him; but that the union should be happy\r\nthe subject must be fitting; it must be “the purely human freed from all\r\nconventionality.” Again: “When I with full consciousness and of my own\r\nfree will gave up Frederick [Barbarossa], I had entered upon a new and\r\ndecisive period of my development as artist and as man, the period when\r\nmy conscious artistic will set out upon an entirely new path made with\r\nunconscious necessity, a path upon which I am now starting as artist and\r\nman to meet a new world.” Upon this his greatest critic says: “The works\r\nwhich followed, created upon this foundation and freed from the Ghost of\r\nOpera, reveal this _new world_.”\r\n\r\nWagner recognizes the dual nature of man. There is the outer man and the\r\ninner man. The perfect drama appeals to both. But music is the language\r\nof the inner man, which has for its special duty the expression of\r\nfeelings and sensibilities—indeed, it can represent nothing else.\r\n\r\nNo man that ever lived was so fitted both by nature and by experience\r\nto appreciate the true functions of the drama as Richard Wagner—he was\r\nborn a poet, he was cradled in the theatre, his classical education,\r\n“the education of a gentleman,” as Leighton put it, opened out to him\r\nthe masterpieces of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Shakespeare. When under the\r\nspell of a distinctly felt want he took to music, behold! that was his\r\nbirthright also—he was the child of the Muses. His long apprenticeship as\r\nKapellmeister—conductor of the orchestra—in the Opera House at Dresden\r\nmade him familiar with the operatic works of the great masters. But it\r\ntaught him a great lesson: it showed him what was the true value of\r\nmusic, what was its relation to the sister art of poetry, and he, poet\r\nand musician as he was, learnt how to give the highest dignity to both.\r\nTheir union was his task, and in 1848 he had come to the realization of\r\nthe significance of that task, for he felt in the fullest degree the\r\nfetters in which the masters who preceded him had worked. He perceived\r\nthat their noblest inspirations were only to be found in the expression\r\nof feelings: where they failed was when they attempted to describe facts.\r\n\r\n“Music,” said Schopenhauer, “never expresses a manifestation, but only\r\nthe inner essence of all manifestations.” The key to Wagner’s music is\r\nto be found in the following propositions which he himself lays down as\r\nfundamental:\r\n\r\n“1. Feelings and sensibilities alone are what is to be expressed in the\r\nlanguage of music. It expresses in the fullness of perfection the inner\r\nfeeling of the purely human language set free from that language of words\r\nwhich has become the special organ of the understanding.\r\n\r\n“2. That which is impossible of expression in the absolute language of\r\nmusic is the exact definition of the subject of feeling and sensibility\r\nin which these reach a true reality.\r\n\r\n“3. The widening and extension of the musical expression consists in the\r\nwinning of the power to indicate that which is individual and special\r\nwith clear distinctness, and\r\n\r\n“4. The language of music can only attain this in its marriage with the\r\nlanguage of words.\r\n\r\n“5. This marriage can only be successful when the language of music is\r\nat once joined to so much of the language of words as is in harmonious\r\nrelation to itself; the union must go forward exactly in the direction\r\nwhere the language of words has itself already manifested an imperious\r\nnecessity for true sensuous expression of feeling.\r\n\r\n“6. This is defined only according to the inner meaning of that which is\r\nto be expressed, so far as this grows from a matter of understanding to\r\na matter of feeling—an inner meaning which can only be grasped by the\r\nunderstanding remains only expressible by the language of words, but the\r\nmore it extends to a movement of feeling the more explicitly it needs a\r\nmeans of expression with which the language of music alone can furnish\r\nit. (Conclusion from these premises.) Here then is clearly defined that\r\nwhich the word-and-tone poet has to express: it is the purely human\r\nset free from all conventionality (from all that which is formal and\r\nhistorical).”\r\n\r\nSuch are the principles upon which the second half of Wagner’s work,\r\nthat which was carried out after 1848, is based; at least such is\r\nWagner’s own setting forth of those principles. How far these views,\r\nso confidently laid down as artistic canon law, are justified by his\r\nown creations and by those of others is a question capable of being\r\ndebated. Wagner’s own work is not uniformly in consonance with them. If\r\nthe historical and the formal are to be shut out from the realm of music\r\nas unfitting, how can we account for so grand a conception as _Rienzi_,\r\na work at least as historical and formal as the discarded _Barbarossa_?\r\nIf nothing conventional is to be portrayed, what is to be said of the\r\n_Meistersinger_, one of the greatest of all Tone-Dramas, though it is\r\nthroughout a picture of medieval middle-class life in Germany? Divest it\r\nof the poet’s inspiration and of the magic charm of music and it sinks at\r\nonce into the commonplace from which genius has lifted it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact there is no phase of man’s life and man’s activity\r\nso prosaic that “das rein-menschliche,” the purely human or ideal, is\r\nnot in some shape or other contained in it. To amplify Schopenhauer’s\r\ndictum, music cannot describe a cathedral with its apse, its nave, its\r\nclerestory, its towers; but it can and does describe the spirit of piety\r\nwhich raised that monument of faith; and it is conceivable that a great\r\ntone-poet, such as Beethoven, should even describe in music the act of\r\nbuilding it. Wagner himself described the forging of the sword by the\r\nDwarf. He could not in the language of music have portrayed the sword\r\nwhen forged. The question is to find the ideal wherever it may be hidden.\r\nWagner found it in _Rienzi_ and in the _Meistersinger_: he failed to find\r\nit in _Barbarossa_. Here surely is one of those arbitrary contradictions\r\nwith which we occasionally meet in men of transcendent genius. It is only\r\nthe smooth man of average brains that is uniformly consistent.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the ideal is revealed in the _Ring des Nibelungen_,\r\nwhich is wholly Fairy Tale, and in _Parsifal_, which is wholly\r\nWorship. In these as poet and as musician Wagner reaches his highest\r\nachievement—poetry and music are united in an indissoluble wedlock; the\r\nsenses are enthralled, and the world bows before the great wizard.\r\n\r\nIf we turn for a moment to the dramatic composition of other composers\r\nwe shall see how entirely they are at their best when their works are\r\ninspired by the ideal, “das rein-menschliche.” That is where the great\r\noratorios derive their glory. They are the musical expression of the\r\nloftiest thoughts of which man’s soul is capable; that is why such\r\na masterpiece as the opening recitative of Handel’s _Messiah_ cries\r\ndirectly to the soul—no one who once heard Sims Reeves deliver the great\r\nmessage of comfort could ever forget it. To go to the opposite pole\r\nof music, the brightest comic opera that ever was produced was surely\r\nRossini’s _Barbiere_. I am old enough to have heard it sung by the\r\ngreatest cast that could be imagined—Bosio as Rosina, Mario Almaviva,\r\nthe grand old Lablache as Dottor Bartolo, Ronconi the barber, Tagliafico\r\nDon Basilio. Rendered by such incomparable singers and actors, the whole\r\nopera sparkled from the first bar to the finale.\r\n\r\nBut what took one out of one’s self was Don Basilio’s _La Calunnia_,\r\na piece of almost Wagnerian declamation. Calumny is “purely human,”\r\nindeed a human monopoly, for animals do not traduce one another, and as\r\nTagliafico, a great artist, told the tale, the effect was electric. The\r\ntrivial and commonplace but quite delightful prettiness of the rest was\r\nforgotten in the presence of a great dramatic effect. It would be easy to\r\nmultiply instances, but these two suffice to show the overwhelming power\r\nof music to express the ideal.\r\n\r\nA main difference between Wagner’s Tone-Drama and what we have known\r\nas “opera” lies in the union of the Tone-Poem with the Word-Poem as\r\ntwo sisters of equal rank, each prepared as the occasion requires it\r\nto give precedence to the other. In the so-called opera the music is\r\neverything; the book may be, and often is, the merest balderdash, void\r\nof all literary or poetic worth. In what Wagner calls “the art work of\r\nthe future,” the music, as he himself puts it, “has to take up a quite\r\ndifferent position; it is only where the music is the predominant partner\r\nthat it may unfold itself to its full breadth; but, on the other hand,\r\nwherever dramatic speech is the most important, there the music must\r\nabsolutely subordinate itself to it. But it so happens that music has the\r\ncapability, without being altogether silent, of so imperceptibly effacing\r\nitself before language that is teeming with thought, as to make it appear\r\nthat that alone is of importance and yet to continue giving it support.”\r\nIt must be evident that this perfect accord between the poem and the\r\nmusic is one of the secrets of the incomparable dignity of Wagner’s\r\nwork. The recognition of the equal value of both precludes the infusion\r\nof anything mean or trivial into either. Here again we may bring into\r\ncomparison the oratorio, in which the music is wedded to the glorious\r\nlanguage of the Bible.\r\n\r\nProbably one reason why it was so long before Wagner achieved anything\r\nlike general success outside of Germany lay in the misuse of the word\r\n“opera,” and also in the fact that his dramas were brought out in\r\ntheatres intimately associated with works of less lofty aspirations.\r\nSmart ladies, mounted in diamonds, and white-waistcoated dandies, had\r\nbeen accustomed to listen entranced to lovely, if somewhat sugary,\r\nmelodies threaded like pearls on strings of recitative, during which\r\nconversation and flirtation were not only permitted but expected.\r\nThey came to hear Wagner looking for the same musical diet, and were\r\ndisappointed. They expected to hear Wotan grind out barrel-organ tunes,\r\nor Brünnhilde declare with many trills that she is “vergine vezzosa.”\r\nThe dignified declamation of Wagner’s heroes and heroines was lost upon\r\nthem. Philistia was bored and showed it. At first they did not realize\r\nthe fact that a work like the _Ring des Nibelungen_ is one comprehensive\r\nwhole, of which one part separated from the rest tells no tale. They know\r\nbetter now; yet even to-day people go into raptures over one portion of\r\nthe _Ring_ without hearing what has gone before or what is to follow.\r\nThey believe that they have heard a Wagner “opera.” The great tragedy of\r\nWotan is missed. _Lohengrin_, with its romantic and beautiful poem, took\r\nthe fancy of the English public much more readily. _Tristan_ too became\r\na favourite; but I have often wondered whether the _Meistersinger_, in\r\nspite of the noble character of the poet-shoemaker Hans Sachs, has ever\r\nquite appealed to nine-tenths of the Covent Garden audience.\r\n\r\nBut at any rate Wagner has become the fashion, and it is now essential\r\nto good breeding and a reputation for culture that he should be received\r\nas The great master—always, be it understood, of “opera.” Yet for the\r\nreasons at which I have hinted I rather doubt the sincerity of the\r\nadoration which is expressed. Dr. Johnson once said, “No man is a\r\nhypocrite in his pleasures”; had Dr. Johnson seen the tiaras and the\r\nwhite waistcoats displaying their nobility in the boxes and stalls of\r\nCovent Garden he might have seen fit to modify his opinion.\r\n\r\nAt Bayreuth things are very different: the sincerity of the audience is\r\nalmost as striking as the beauty of the performance. A drama given in the\r\nFest-Spiel house is no mere theatrical entertainment; it is more like\r\na religious ceremony. The people standing outside the building, like a\r\ncongregation in some country churchyard waiting for service to begin, are\r\nvery quiet, speaking little, and that little in hushed voices, tuning\r\nthemselves to the diapason of the solemn feast which is in store for\r\nthem. When the doors are opened they troop in silently, and reverently\r\ntake their places. There is no chatter; if speech be needed it is in a\r\nwhisper. The audience—worshippers would be a better word—sit in rapt\r\ncontemplation, waiting for the ceremony to begin.\r\n\r\nAfter a while subdued and solemn strains from the hidden orchestra creep\r\ninto the theatre—the opening notes of the _Rheingold_. The performance\r\nof the _Ring des Nibelungen_ has begun. The house is darkened, and will\r\nhave no more light than what is sent to it from the stage. Slowly, very\r\nslowly, the curtain is drawn aside, and through a dim mist faintly we\r\nsee the Rhine-maidens swimming in the sacred stream. So perfect is the\r\nillusion that we seem to be looking into the very depths of the river\r\nfrom some fairy vantage-ground. The poetry of music, language, motion\r\n(dancing was one of those elements of the ancient Greek drama of which\r\nWagner recognized the value), all combine to make that perfect appeal to\r\nsight and hearing and the senses of the soul which is the essence of the\r\nTone-Drama.\r\n\r\nThere is no dropping of the curtain at the end of the first act—clouds\r\nof steam roll up lazily in the foreground, and are met by falling mists\r\nof gauze and network—the stage grows dimmer and more dim, until all is\r\nhidden. Slowly and mysteriously the clouds fade away, and the second\r\nscene is revealed. Beautiful as are the first two scenes, I think that\r\nthe Cave of the Dwarfs is even more captivating. The great rocks on the\r\nright of the stage run back into the mystery of space; the trickling of\r\nwater gleaming here and there amid the mosses gives a most realistic\r\neffect—just what may be seen in some natural Alpine cavern. On the left\r\nis the glowing forge of the gnomes, which looks as if the whole stage\r\nmust presently blaze into flames. The horrors of this miniature hell,\r\nwith the appearance of the laidly worm and the little crooked dwarfs\r\nrushing about intent upon some weird business, leave the impression\r\nof a Satan’s Sabbath. It is a scenic effect beyond all anticipation,\r\ndifficult to realize. Wagner was a great magician, and could transport\r\nhis people whither he listed—for, mark you! it is all his doing—his the\r\nconception, his the execution. The book, the music, the scenery, the\r\nstage-management, all the invention of that one brain. What a power he\r\nwielded!\r\n\r\nYou must journey to Bayreuth to feel its full force. There the master\r\nmind, the singers, the orchestra, and last, not least, the audience, are\r\nall in sympathy, and it is the creation of this sympathy which shows how\r\ngreat Wagner was.\r\n\r\nThe religious feeling which runs through the performance, the reverence\r\nwith which it is received, are enhanced by the abstention from anything\r\nlike applause. The nearest approach to it is something approaching to\r\na sob of relief which follows upon such supreme moments as the fall of\r\nthe curtain upon the flames of Valhalla (in the _Götterdämmerung_); but\r\nthat sob says more than all the ridiculous calls before the curtain with\r\nwhich we destroy any illusion that may have been created by the finest\r\nefforts of our actors. Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Ophelia, Othello\r\nand Desdemona called to life again to grin a fatuous good-night to the\r\naudience! _Proh pudor!_ Let the players go to Bayreuth and learn what is\r\ndue, if not to the dignity of their own art, at any rate to the genius of\r\nthe poet whose interpreters they are.\r\n\r\nWagner felt music as the revelation of the language of another world—a\r\nlanguage of which Beethoven, Mozart, Bach were the teachers. We have seen\r\nhow the music of _Egmont_ appealed to him as a boy. With what force he\r\nused that language to appeal to the deepest feelings of those to whom he\r\nspecially addressed himself will best be recognized by those who may have\r\nthe privilege of attending the _General-Probe_, the dress rehearsal of\r\none of the festivals.\r\n\r\nHere are no tourists, no sham amateurs travelling to the little\r\nFranconian town because it is “the thing” to do, and as though the\r\npilgrimage conferred a degree in culture. The guests are all invited from\r\nthe very flower of Germany’s intellect—men who have earned honour in the\r\nmost varied careers, women who are famous in many branches of work. These\r\nare the worshippers who flock to the shrine of the Cult, these the minds\r\nthat the great poet holds in the thraldom of his genius. With the silence\r\nof conviction they accept his preaching: the Early Christians meeting in\r\nthe Catacombs could hardly have been more reverent or more reserved.\r\n\r\nIn any sketch of Bayreuth, however flimsy, a word must be said about\r\nWahnfried, the home of Wagner’s happiest days, the house where those who\r\nwere nearest and dearest to him must almost feel as if they were still\r\nunder the guardianship of that mighty soul: so filled is the place with\r\nmemories of his presence that even strangers seem to be held by the spell\r\nof his spirit hovering over the trees that he loved, the garden that he\r\nlaid out with such care and such consummate simplicity.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing ambitious, nothing pretentious here. It is just a plain,\r\ndignified gentleman’s home, _entre cour et jardin_; the court surrounded\r\non three sides by shady alleys, an avenue of horse-chestnuts leading\r\nto a little forecourt in which the central ornament is a bust of King\r\nLouis of Bavaria, after Liszt, Wagner’s greatest friend, and certainly a\r\npowerful protector, who would have done so much more for him had he been\r\nable. Over the doorway is a sgraffito, “Wotan the Wanderer”; no other\r\ndecoration save only in great letters the famous inscription, “Hier we\r\nmein Wähnen Frieden fand WAHNFRIED sei dieses Haus von mir benannt.”\r\n“Here where my wild dreams peace attained WAHNFRIED [Dreams-Peace] be\r\nthis house by me named.” A poor jingle of a translation, but perhaps the\r\noriginal is not to be rendered in another tongue. But what a tinge of\r\nmelancholy lies in it! A long day of struggles and misery, an evening of\r\npeace and happiness, and then suddenly at Venice—the Night!\r\n\r\nFew people will deny that in a man’s home much of himself will be found\r\nreflected. I am not now speaking of those houses built to a pattern,\r\neven if it be a fanciful one, and adorned and furnished by some famous\r\ndecorator: in these the reflection is that not of a mind, but of a firm,\r\nand there is a brotherly or at farthest a cousinly likeness between all\r\nthose that are the work of the same partners: the difference is mainly\r\none of pounds, shillings, and pence: even the books in the library look\r\nas if they had been ordered by the yard. The piano is placed for looks,\r\nnot for sound. The pictures are chosen by the fashionable dealer of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe house of a man of character and distinction bears the impress of his\r\nown imagination. Especially is this the case when he himself has built\r\nit. In Wahnfried everything speaks to you of Wagner. The design was his:\r\nthe admirably proportioned rooms were planned and measured by him: every\r\ndetail was thought out with strenuous care and loving foresight. The\r\nlibrary, it has been said, “bears eloquent testimony to the universality\r\nof Wagner’s genius.” The works of art, the knick-knacks, all tell their\r\nstory. There are several quite admirable portraits by Lenbach, pictures\r\nthat will live; one portrait especially of Frau Wagner is a masterpiece\r\nthat will not be denied.\r\n\r\nBut a likeness of Schopenhauer, painted by Lenbach after the\r\nphilosopher’s death, has a story that is worth repeating. When\r\nSchopenhauer died, Wagner, who had the greatest admiration for him,\r\nbegged Lenbach to paint a portrait of him. “But I never saw him,” said\r\nthe artist, and declared that it was impossible. Now it so happened\r\nthat a certain photographer, in cleaning out his drawers, came upon\r\na photograph of Schopenhauer, the existence of which he had quite\r\nforgotten. Wagner, who had secured it, showed it to Lenbach and asked him\r\nwhether that would not help him. The painter looked at it, and exclaimed,\r\n“Why that is my little old man!” and then told the tale of how one\r\nday walking in the street he had met a curiously comic little old man\r\nfidgeting about hither and thither from one shop-window to another, and\r\nhad been so struck by the grotesqueness of the little creature that he\r\nfollowed him about, making mental notes of him, for the whole afternoon.\r\nSo he was delighted to undertake the portrait, and by the help of the\r\nphotograph, supplementing his own memory, produced what must be reckoned\r\na famous work of art.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the house is the garden. Here too the all-embracing genius\r\nof the master found room for play. He laid it out with exquisite and\r\ndelicate taste. A lawn with flowers leads to a little shady wood, and\r\nthat again opens on to the public gardens of the town. In front of the\r\nwood, or rather in a recess screened and shaded by it, is a bust of the\r\nmaster facing the house. It marks his grave. He lies in the home which he\r\nloved, in the place where he found Peace.\r\n\r\nIt was in this sacred grove that I had the honour of being received by\r\nthe gracious lady of Wahnfried. She is now, alas! able to see very few\r\npeople, but she made an exception in my favour, and I had half an hour’s\r\ndelightful conversation with her. In appearance I thought her little\r\naltered from what I remember her in 1877, when she came with her husband\r\nfor the great concerts at the Albert Hall, and when those who had not the\r\nprivilege of speaking with her were fascinated by her beautiful presence.\r\nThough she is not strong, the years have touched her lightly—a little\r\nmore snow in the hair, the features a little more marked, reminding one\r\nmore than ever of her great father, Franz Liszt—but she has retained all\r\nthe grace, all the charm, all the magic of sympathy, all the keenness of\r\nthought for which she has been world-famous. Indeed, the world owes her\r\nno small meed of gratitude for the zeal and brilliant talent with which\r\nafter the master’s death she threw herself into the work of keeping alive\r\nthe great performances of the Fest-Spiel-Haus.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of financial difficulty when the fate of Bayreuth\r\ntrembled in the balance; she has swept away all doubt, and her enthusiasm\r\nhas been so infectious that the little Franconian town has become one of\r\nthe centres of the world’s culture: all its past is forgotten, even Jean\r\nPaul is hardly remembered, so all-absorbing is the Wagnerian aura. Royal\r\npersonages, the princes in the several realms of art, science, letters,\r\nand politics, men and women famous in all the walks of life, have made\r\nthese celebrations their trysting-place, and people who elsewhere grumble\r\nat the highest extravagance of luxury are content to put up with the\r\nsimplest of fare and the humblest accommodation if only they may be\r\nallowed to lay their tribute on the high altar of genius.\r\n\r\nA gathering at Wahnfried is something to remember; it is a goodly\r\ncompany, a cosmopolitan galaxy of talent. Failing health prevents the\r\ngreat hostess from welcoming her guests in person, but she is well\r\nrepresented by her children, Siegfried Wagner and his sister, round whom\r\nare assembled all the most distinguished of the visitors to the town. It\r\nis a company in which a man must needs feel very humble. For here every\r\none has achieved something in the world. Here is a recognized authority\r\nas antiquary and historian; there the great physician who watched over\r\nPrince Bismarck’s latest years: famous musicians, learned professors,\r\na few notable soldiers, are much to the front: one lady is translating\r\ninto German an American philosophical work; other ladies are engaged in\r\nvarious branches of art; some are successful actresses, others well-known\r\nand cherished singers; here are painters who have achieved fame, younger\r\nmen who are climbing that same giddy ladder; of literary men there is no\r\nlack. The conversation is brilliant; it is only interrupted now and then\r\nby such music as would compel even the Philistines to hold their peace.\r\nIt would be strange indeed if in the home of Richard Wagner obedience\r\nwere not given to the old Italian warning, “Il più grande omaggio alla\r\nmusica è il silenzio.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nA LAST WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my memory of what took place at St. Petersburg in 1864 was made\r\nready for the printer, the storm which some of us foresaw as the\r\ninevitable consequence, sooner or later, of the shameless betrayal of\r\nDenmark in that year, has burst upon the world in all the fulness of its\r\nfury. Never have the vials of wrath been poured upon mankind with such\r\nremorseless cruelty; of that cup of a poison which has been brewing for\r\nfifty years we now have to drink the bitter dregs.\r\n\r\nHow clearly does every link in the chain of villainy stand out! In 1864 a\r\nscrap of paper, signed by Prussia in 1852, assuring the inviolability of\r\nDenmark, is torn up. England, after much bluster and many threats, stands\r\nby and looks on unconcerned. Remember the words of Prince Gortchakoff:\r\n“I put on one side the supposition that England will ever make war for\r\na question of honour” (see pages 241-245). Then followed 1866, when the\r\nrobbers quarrelled over their booty. Then 1870, when France paid the bill\r\nfor the mistakes of her Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Louis Napoléon was not fortunate. He never\r\naltogether recovered the prestige which he lost in Mexico—an unhappy\r\nventure if ever there was such—but how bitterly he must have repented\r\nhis attitude in 1864, when for an affront to his vanity he stood aloof.\r\nYet mortified vanity was not the only motive power which goaded him\r\nto his ruin. He hated Austria—as he proved by his actions. But in the\r\nbeginning of his reign he had a great predilection for Prussia. I have\r\nbeen told by a distinguished Frenchman who knew intimately all that\r\noccurred behind the scenes in the late fifties and early sixties that at\r\na banquet which took place at the Tuileries the ambition of Prussia came\r\nunder discussion. The French Emperor professed unbounded admiration for\r\nthe North German character, in contrast to that of the Southern German\r\nand Austria. He said that he considered that Prussia stood for progress,\r\nculture and civilization. The Empress, on the contrary, made no secret of\r\nher preference for Austria.\r\n\r\nWhat an answer to Louis Napoléon’s infatuation are the tragedies of\r\nLiége, Louvain, Reims, Arras, Ypres; and how true the prophetic words\r\nof the mad German philosopher-poet, Nietzsche: “There are political\r\nand social fanatics who zealously and eloquently call for an overthrow\r\nof all institutions, believing that the proudest temple of a beautiful\r\nhumanity would then rise automatically ... unfortunately we know by\r\nhistorical experience that every such overthrow revives the wildest\r\nenergies, the long-buried horrors and excesses of remote ages.” The last\r\ninstitution to be overthrown has been that of international rights and\r\nthe honour-compelling force of treaties. We have seen the consequences.\r\n\r\nEven worse than the folly of Louis Napoléon was that of those Frenchmen\r\nof fifty years ago who, seeing that Kiel would give Germany a navy,\r\nurged that it would be good policy for France to further, even by her\r\ninactivity, the ambition of Bismarck. Would it not lead to the lowering\r\nof England’s sea-power, and, as M. de Massignac—no visionary, but a sober\r\ndiplomatist—put it—“would not that be for the advantage of France?” (see\r\npage 241).\r\n\r\nHow would France stand to-day were the German fleet not locked up,\r\nfearing to move out of its mine-protected harbour, stolen from Denmark?\r\nWhat would be the condition of the French towns on the shores of the\r\nNorth Sea?\r\n\r\nBeing a trustee of the Anglo-German Foundation, that more than princely\r\ngift which Sir Ernest Cassel dedicated to the memory of King Edward\r\nthe Seventh, I had to go to Berlin on business, in the month of\r\nOctober, 1913. My colleagues and myself were treated to a right royal\r\nreception—right royal in every sense of the words. I had the opportunity\r\nof talking with all the leading men, from the highest downward. There\r\nwas one subject upon which they all dwelt without exception, and\r\nthat was the embarrassment of the English Government in the face of\r\nthe difficulties in Ireland, the rights of women, colonial and Indian\r\ndiscontent. Of course the conversation took the shape of disinterested\r\ndiscussion: subsequent events showed that in reality my hypocritical\r\nentertainers had not been above trying to pick the brains even of\r\nso inconspicuous a person as myself. Nothing pleased them more than\r\nspeculating upon the possible attitude of individual members of our\r\nGovernment and of the Opposition, discussing them all one by one. Was\r\nthe North of Ireland really determined? Would Ulster fight, and if so,\r\nhow far could the army be relied upon? How far would the influence of\r\nSir Edward Carson prevail? Would the Government deal firmly with the\r\nsuffragists, and if so how? What fiscal sop would have to be thrown to\r\nthe Colonies? Was India disloyal? It was impossible not to be touched by\r\nthe sympathy shown by the kindly and disinterested Teuton in the troubles\r\nof England!\r\n\r\nThe very able and interesting article signed “Americanus” in the\r\n_Spectator_ of August 7th, 1915, after pointing out the preparations\r\nmade by Germany for four decades and “her practical anticipation for at\r\nleast two years of the present alignment of the nations,” goes on to\r\nsay: “The avowed surprise of German statesmen as to the intervention\r\nof this country in behalf of Belgium is thus shown to be a diplomatic\r\naffectation,” and he indicates that the evidence brought forward in\r\nthe Beck case at Boston “establishes in the most practical way the\r\nexpectation of Germany for over two years that her own ambitions might\r\nbring her at any time into conflict with England, Russia and France.”\r\n\r\nThe surprise was no affectation. It was very real. The German\r\nExcellencies, it is true, were well aware that all England’s sympathies\r\nwould be with France and Russia, and that she would bitterly resent any\r\nviolation of Belgian territory. Their ultimate objective, moreover, was,\r\nas we now know, England. All their preparations had been made with the\r\nintention of destroying our naval supremacy. The surprise lay in the\r\ndiscovery that England was ready to put all internal trouble on one side\r\nand to throw her whole might into the scale with her allies. But when\r\nthe mere declaration of war swept away every trace of disagreement and\r\nserved only to knit together into the closest bonds of union England,\r\nIreland, discontented women, India, and the Colonies—all the elements\r\nof distraction—and to act as an amalgam, welding together the British\r\nEmpire into a solid fusion such as no man had ever dreamed of—then\r\ntheir indignation knew no bounds. The Germans believed that they had\r\nfound their Day for crushing Russia and devastating France, with such\r\nsubsidiary advantages as the annexation of Belgium and Holland. After\r\nthat should come the turn of England—England without a friend, an ally,\r\nor a lover. The psychological moment had arrived when England’s hands\r\nwere, as they thought, tied, and she would be compelled to renounce her\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nHere I can add a piece of evidence which has probably escaped attention.\r\nStraws show which way the current is set. The Kaiser, firmly convinced\r\nthat all would go on as usual in an England apathetic in all matters save\r\nthose relating to sport, on the 10th of July entered his yacht for the\r\nCowes Regatta, and as usual sent the great cup which he gave annually\r\nto the Royal Yacht Squadron. Prince Henry of Prussia was expected at\r\nCowes, was actually in England, and only telegraphing his excuses to\r\nhis host and hostess on the Saturday morning hurried back to Germany.\r\nOn the 3rd of August the Royal Yacht Squadron held a meeting and by\r\nspecial desire of the King we abandoned the Regatta. On the 4th of August\r\nEngland declared war. The disillusion must have been mortifying. As for\r\nthe _Meteor_, she remained at Kiel, where, with the rest of the Kaiser’s\r\nships—as harmless as herself—she still lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n          _Printed at The Chapel River Press, Kingston, Surrey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Maéda, the family name of the Princes of Kaga.

They are correctly\r\ngiven here. I have submitted the account to Admiral Sir Henry Stephenson\r\nand he confirms my account in every detail. Herr von Brandt gives the\r\ndate of Admiral Bell’s loss as the 8th, which is right, but he says our\r\nadventure took place a few days earlier, which is wrong.\r\n\r\n[5] He was not even in Japan, for he was only appointed to a student\r\ninterpretership in the following year.\r\n\r\n[6] The universal custom among married women in Old Japan. I suppose\r\nthat to-day it would be impossible to find such a case throughout all\r\nthe islands, where the ladies now follow French fashions and are dressed\r\nby Paris. The shaving of the eyebrows was an important event, announced\r\nin the case of the Empress in the _Kiōto Gazette_ of April 20th, 1869,\r\nin the following words: “To the Princes of the Blood, Kugés and Princes.\r\nThe first day of next month having been fixed for the ceremony of\r\nshaving off the eyebrows of the Empress, you are ordered to offer your\r\ncongratulations at the Palaces of the Empress Dowager and of the Empress.\r\nIt is not necessary to present offerings. Persons in mourning will attend\r\non the following day.” The recipe for lacquering the teeth is given in my\r\n“Tales of Old Japan.” It was formerly the fashion for the Emperor and his\r\nnobles to blacken their teeth. It originated with one Hanozono Arishito,\r\nwho was Sadaijin, or minister of the left, at the Court of the Emperor\r\nToba early in the twelfth century. He was an æsthete, with feminine\r\ntastes, who plucked out his eyebrows, blackened his teeth, powdered his\r\nface and rouged his lips, so as to look as like a woman as possible. The\r\ncustom became widely spread among nobles in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n[7] Ashikaga Yoshimasa ruled Japan as Shōgun in the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth century. He was famous for his culture and for his æsthetic\r\ntastes. His symposia at Ginkakuji, the Temple of the Silver Pavilion, are\r\ncelebrated in Japanese history.

The Empress Jōtō, astonished at this, asked the\r\nreason. The Emperor answered and said, ‘The season is now cold; I think\r\nof the poor who are naked.

The cost to\r\nFrance in blood and money must have been something huge.\r\n\r\n[31] Latakieh.\r\n\r\n[32] Acts of the Apostles, ix., 11.\r\n\r\n[33] Sir William Howard Russell, the famous war correspondent of the\r\n_Times_.\r\n\r\n[34] “Cannon and Knapp,” p. 248.\r\n\r\n[35] “Cannon and Knapp,” p. 222.\r\n\r\n[36] Pinus Lambertiana—the sugar pine.\r\n\r\n[37] Delane’s memory was prodigious. I remember a dinner at the house of\r\nthe Lord Chief Justice, Sir Alexander Cockburn; the conversation turned\r\nupon a certain _cause célèbre_. Cockburn said that he knew nothing about\r\nit. “That is strange,” said Delane, “for you were one of the junior\r\ncounsel.”\r\n\r\n[38] “Conversations with Prince Bismarck.” Poschinger.

His dinners in Montagu\r\nSquare, at which I was often a guest, were delightfully Bohemian and\r\nartistic.\r\n\r\n[41] Curiously enough it was Disraeli himself who let the cat out of\r\nthe bag. It was he who called the attention of George Smythe (Lord\r\nStrangford), his old colleague in the Young England Party, to an article\r\nin the _Morning Chronicle_ in 1848, in which the words of Thiers were\r\ntranslated. The _Globe_ published Disraeli’s speech and Thiers’ article\r\nin columns side by side—and George Smythe told the whole story in defence\r\nof Disraeli in a letter to the _Times_. It is always said that Thiers’\r\n“speech” was a panegyric on the death of Marshal St. Cyr. This can hardly\r\nbe right, for St. Cyr was alive in 1848 and Thiers would scarcely have\r\npronounced such a eulogy upon a third-rate living General. See Mr. T.
