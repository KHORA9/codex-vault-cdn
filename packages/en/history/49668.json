JENKINS,\r\n 114 Nassau street, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is intended to form the first of a series of volumes,\r\nconsisting of original memoirs on different branches of knowledge\r\npublished at the expense, and under the direction of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. The publication of this series forms part of a general\r\nplan adopted for carrying into effect the benevolent intentions of\r\nJAMES SMITHSON, Esq., of England. This gentleman left his property\r\nin trust to the United States of America, to found at Washington an\r\ninstitution which should bear his own name, and have for its objects\r\n“the «increase» and «diffusion» of knowledge among men.” This trust\r\nwas accepted by the Government of the United States, and an Act of\r\nCongress was passed August 10th, 1846, constituting the President and\r\nthe other principal executive officers of the general government, the\r\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Mayor of Washington, and such\r\nother persons as they might elect honorary members, an establishment\r\nunder the name of the “SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE INCREASE AND\r\nDIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG MEN.” The members and honorary members\r\nof this establishment are to hold stated and special meetings for the\r\nsupervision of the affairs of the Institution, and for the advice and\r\ninstruction of a Board of Regents, to whom the financial and other\r\naffairs are entrusted.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Regents consists of three members ex officio of the\r\nestablishment, namely, the Vice President of the United States, the\r\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Mayor of Washington,\r\ntogether with twelve other members, three of whom are appointed by\r\nthe Senate from its own body, three by the House of Representatives\r\nfrom its members, and six citizens appointed by a joint resolution of\r\nboth houses. To this board is given the power of electing a Secretary\r\nand other officers, for conducting the active operations of the\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nTo carry into effect the purposes of the testator, the plan of\r\norganization should evidently embrace two objects,—one, the increase\r\nof knowledge by the addition of new truths to the existing stock;\r\nthe other, the diffusion of knowledge thus increased, among men. No\r\nrestriction is made in favor of any kind of knowledge, and hence each\r\nbranch is entitled to and should receive a share of attention.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress, establishing the Institution, directs, as a part\r\nof the plan of organization, the formation of a Library, a Museum,\r\nand a Gallery of Art, together with provisions for physical research\r\nand popular lectures, while it leaves to the Regents the power of\r\nadopting such other parts of an organization as they may deem best\r\nsuited to promote the objects of the bequest.\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, the Regents resolved to divide the annual\r\nincome, thirty thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars, into two\r\nequal parts,—one part to be devoted to the increase and diffusion of\r\nknowledge by means of original research and publications,—the other\r\nhalf of the income to be applied in accordance with the requirements\r\nof the Act of Congress, to the gradual formation of a Library, a\r\nMuseum, and a Gallery of Art.\r\n\r\nThe following are the details of the two parts of the general plan\r\nof organization provisionally adopted at the meeting of the Regents,\r\nDec. 8th, 1847.\r\n\r\nDETAILS OF THE FIRST PART OF THE PLAN.\r\n\r\nI. TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.—«It is proposed to stimulate research, by\r\noffering rewards, consisting of money, medals, etc., for original\r\nmemoirs on all subjects of investigation.»\r\n\r\n1. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,\r\nin a quarto form, and entitled “Smithsonian Contributions to\r\nKnowledge.”\r\n\r\n2. No memoir, on subjects of physical science, to be accepted\r\nfor publication, which does not furnish a positive addition to\r\nhuman knowledge, resting on original research; and all unverified\r\nspeculations to be rejected.\r\n\r\n3. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for\r\nexamination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning\r\nin the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for\r\npublication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.\r\n\r\n4. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,\r\nand the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless\r\na favorable decision be made.\r\n\r\n5. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the Transactions\r\nof literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all\r\nthe colleges, and principal libraries, in this country. One part of\r\nthe remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully\r\npreserved, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand\r\nfrom new institutions.\r\n\r\n6. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs\r\nto be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nII. TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.—«It is also proposed to appropriate a\r\nportion of the income, annually, to special objects of research,\r\nunder the direction of suitable persons.»\r\n\r\n1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended by\r\ncounsellors of the Institution.\r\n\r\n2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that in\r\ncourse of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.\r\n\r\n3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,\r\nwith the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian\r\nContributions to Knowledge.\r\n\r\n4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made:\r\n\r\n(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the\r\nproblem of American storms.\r\n\r\n(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,\r\nmagnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the\r\nformation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.\r\n\r\n(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination\r\nof the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and\r\nof light; chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and\r\npublication of articles of science, accumulated in the offices of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,\r\nmoral, and political subjects.\r\n\r\n(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated\r\nin American history.\r\n\r\n(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the\r\ndifferent races of men in North America; also explorations, and\r\naccurate surveys, of the mounds and other remains of the ancient\r\npeople of our country.\r\n\r\nI. TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE.—«It is proposed to publish a series of\r\nreports, giving an account of the new discoveries in science, and of\r\nthe changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not\r\nstrictly professional.»\r\n\r\n1. Some of these reports may be published annually, others at longer\r\nintervals, as the income of the Institution or the changes in the\r\nbranches of knowledge may indicate.\r\n\r\n2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators, eminent in the\r\ndifferent branches of knowledge.\r\n\r\n3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and\r\npublications, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of\r\nhis report; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named\r\non the title-page of the report.\r\n\r\n4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons\r\ninterested in a particular branch, can procure the parts relating to\r\nit without purchasing the whole.\r\n\r\n5. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial\r\ndistribution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and\r\nscientific institutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.\r\n\r\n«The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the\r\nreports:»\r\n\r\nI. PHYSICAL CLASS.\r\n\r\n1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, and\r\nmeteorology.\r\n\r\n2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.\r\n\r\n3. Agriculture.\r\n\r\n4. Application of science to arts.\r\n\r\nII. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.\r\n\r\n5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,\r\nantiquities, &c.\r\n\r\n6. Statistics and political economy.\r\n\r\n7. Mental and moral philosophy.\r\n\r\n8. A survey of the political events of the world; penal reform, &c.\r\n\r\nIII. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n9. Modern literature.\r\n\r\n10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.\r\n\r\n11. Bibliography.\r\n\r\n12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.\r\n\r\nII. TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE.—«It is proposed to publish occasionally\r\nseparate treatises on subjects of general interest.»\r\n\r\n1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs\r\ntranslated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the\r\ndirection of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for\r\nthe best exposition of a given subject.\r\n\r\n2. The treatises to be submitted to a commission of competent judges,\r\nprevious to their publication.\r\n\r\nDETAILS OF THE SECOND PART OF THE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThis part contemplates the formation of a Library, a Museum, and a\r\nGallery of Art.\r\n\r\n1. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be\r\nrequired, consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the\r\ntransactions and proceedings of all the learned societies in the\r\nworld; 2d, of the more important current periodical publications, and\r\nother works necessary in preparing the periodical reports.\r\n\r\n2. The Institution should make special collections, particularly\r\nof objects to verify its own publications. Also a collection of\r\ninstruments of research in all branches of experimental science.\r\n\r\n3. With reference to the collection of books, other than those\r\nmentioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the\r\nUnited States should be procured, in order that the valuable books\r\nfirst purchased may be such as are not to be found elsewhere in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n4. Also catalogues of memoirs, and of books in foreign libraries, and\r\nother materials, should be collected for rendering the Institution\r\na centre of bibliographical knowledge, whence the student may be\r\ndirected to any work which he may require.\r\n\r\n5. It is believed that the collections in natural history will\r\nincrease by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can\r\nmake provisions for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom\r\nbe necessary to purchase any articles of this kind.\r\n\r\n6. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts of\r\nthe most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.\r\n\r\n7. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense,\r\nfor the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other similar\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n8. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of\r\nantiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.\r\n\r\n9. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, only\r\none permanent assistant to the Secretary will be required, to act as\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\n10. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,\r\nwill be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to\r\nexhibit new objects of art; distinguished individuals should also be\r\ninvited to give lectures on subjects of general interest.\r\n\r\n11. When the building is completed, and when, in accordance with the\r\nAct of Congress, the charge of the National Museum is given to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, other assistants will be required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first memoir of the proper character presented after the adoption\r\nof the foregoing plan of organization, was the one which occupies\r\nthe present volume. It was submitted in accordance with the rule\r\nadopted, to a commission of examination, consisting of a committee\r\nof the members of the American Ethnological Society, and on the\r\nfavorable report of this committee and the responsibility of the\r\nSociety, the memoir was accepted for publication. The following is\r\nthe correspondence which took place on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.\r\n\r\n CHILLICOTHE, OHIO, «May» 15, 1847.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR:—It is proposed in the recognized plan of organization of\r\n the Smithsonian Institution, of which you are the executive officer,\r\n to publish, under the title of “«Smithsonian Contributions to\r\n Knowledge»,” such original papers and memoirs “as shall constitute\r\n valuable additions to the sum of human knowledge.” Under the belief\r\n that it falls legitimately within the scope of the above plan,\r\n the undersigned herewith submit for acceptance and publication,\r\n subject to the prescribed rules of the Institution, a MS. memoir\r\n entitled “ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY, «comprising\r\n the results of Extensive Original Surveys and Explorations:» by E.\r\n G. SQUIER and E. H. DAVIS.” The extent of these investigations, and\r\n their general character, are sufficiently indicated in the prefatory\r\n remarks to the volume.\r\n\r\n                     With high consideration, we are truly yours,\r\n                                                          E.

The accompanying memoir, entitled ‘ANCIENT MONUMENTS\r\n OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY,’ etc. etc., having been presented for\r\n publication, I beg leave to refer the same, through you, to the\r\n American Ethnological Society, with the request that a committee of\r\n the members may be appointed to examine and report on the character\r\n of the work, with reference to the particulars above mentioned.\r\n If the report of the committee be favorable, the memoir, without\r\n further consideration, will be accepted for publication; full\r\n confidence being placed in the ability of the committee to judge of\r\n the article, and in their caution in making up their opinion.\r\n\r\n “I have the honor to be, very respectfully,\r\n                              “Your ob’t servant,   JOSEPH HENRY,\r\n                                              “Secretary Smithsonian Inst.\r\n “Hon.

E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis,\r\n submitted with your letter of the 2d instant.\r\n\r\n “I approve entirely of the resolutions and recommendations of the\r\n Society. The publication of Mr. C. Atwater, in the first volume of\r\n the Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society of Worcester,\r\n which appeared twenty years ago, is as yet, so far as I know, the\r\n only general account of the antiquarian remains of the West, which\r\n is entitled to any credit. Yet, many mistakes have been discovered\r\n in it, and it is very incomplete, and in no degree to be compared to\r\n the extensive researches of the gentlemen above mentioned. What has\r\n particularly recommended their labors to me is their love of truth.\r\n\r\n “Such are the combined effects of the fondness for the marvellous,\r\n of the illusions of the imagination, of credulity, thirst of\r\n notoriety and lack of discrimination, that, in many specific\r\n statements, and in almost all the general accounts of our Western\r\n antiquities, which I have seen, the most vague and fabulous reports\r\n (independent of most groundless theories), and even flagrant\r\n impositions, are so mixed with true accounts, as to render it\r\n almost impossible, even for the American reader, to make the proper\r\n discrimination, or arrive at a correct estimate of their extent or\r\n character.\r\n\r\n “Whatever may be the intrinsic value of the remains of former times\r\n which are found in the United States, it is necessary that they\r\n should at least be correctly described, and that existing gross\r\n errors should be corrected; and I repeat my conviction that, though\r\n ardent, Messrs. Squier and Davis are animated by that thorough love\r\n of truth, which renders their researches worthy of entire confidence.\r\n\r\n “Late Ethnological researches have thrown such light on the History\r\n of Man, that it is unnecessary to dwell on their general utility.\r\n With respect to those which relate to the Indians of the United\r\n States, I am ready to acknowledge, the field is comparatively\r\n barren, and the results hitherto attained neither satisfactory nor\r\n refreshing. Still, with proper caution, important information may\r\n be acquired, on what man, insulated, and without intercourse with\r\n other nations, can, by his solitary efforts, accomplish. In order,\r\n however, to attain these results, considerations, foreign to the\r\n immediate object of this letter, are required, which may hereafter\r\n be made the subject of another communication.\r\n\r\n                 “I have the honor to be, &c.\r\n                                                      “ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n               “Professor J. HENRY, Secretary Smithsonian Institution.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “At a regular meeting of the American Ethnological Society, held\r\n at the house of Hon. ALBERT GALLATIN, on the evening of the 4th\r\n of June, the President laid before the members a communication\r\n from Professor J. HENRY, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution;\r\n transmitting for the examination and opinion of the Society, a MS.\r\n work on the Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. On motion,\r\n the letter and accompanying MS. were referred to a committee,\r\n consisting of EDWARD ROBINSON, D.D., JOHN R. BARTLETT, Professor\r\n W. W. TURNER, SAMUEL G. MORTON, M.D., and Hon. GEORGE P. MARSH, to\r\n report upon the same. At a subsequent meeting of this Society, the\r\n committee submitted the following Report and Resolutions, which were\r\n unanimously accepted and adopted:—\r\n\r\n\r\n “REPORT.\r\n\r\n “The Committee of the American Ethnological Society, to which was\r\n referred the communication of the Secretary of the Smithsonian\r\n Institution, transmitting a manuscript work entitled ‘ANCIENT\r\n MONUMENTS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY; «comprising the Results of\r\n Extensive Original Surveys and Explorations», by E. G. SQUIER and E.\r\n H. DAVIS,’ beg leave to report that—\r\n\r\n “They have examined the work in question, and regard it not only as\r\n a new and interesting, but an eminently valuable addition to our\r\n stock of knowledge on a subject little understood, but in which is\r\n felt a deep and constantly increasing interest, both in our country\r\n and abroad. In their judgment the work is worthy of the subject,\r\n and highly creditable to the authors. Its chief features are, a\r\n scientific arrangement, simplicity and directness of statement, and\r\n legitimate deduction of facts, while there is no attempt at mere\r\n speculation or theory. If published, it will be an enduring monument\r\n to connect the names of the investigators in honorable and lasting\r\n remembrance with the great subject of American Archæology.\r\n\r\n “The existence and progress of these investigations were made known\r\n to the Society by correspondence, early in the year 1846; and in\r\n June of that year, specimens of the relics recovered, accompanied by\r\n numerous maps and plans of ancient Earthworks and Sectional Views\r\n of the Mounds from which the remains were taken, were laid before\r\n the Society by Mr. Squier in person. These excited deep interest\r\n and surprise in all who saw them; and the Society immediately\r\n took measures to encourage further investigation, and secure the\r\n publication, under its own auspices, of the important results\r\n already obtained. A few months later, the chairman of the present\r\n committee, being in Ohio, was enabled, through the kindness of\r\n Messrs. Squier and Davis, to visit several of the more important\r\n monuments in the immediate vicinity of Chillicothe; and among these\r\n ‘Mound City,’ so called, from which very many of the minor relics\r\n and specimens were procured. He was struck with the accuracy of the\r\n plans and drawings as well as of the accounts which had been laid\r\n before the Society; and bears full testimony to the fidelity and\r\n integrity with which the process of investigation and delineation\r\n has been conducted.\r\n\r\n “During the last and present season the researches of these\r\n gentlemen have been actively prosecuted and widely extended, and\r\n the above work, largely illustrated, comprising the results,\r\n has been prepared. These results are so numerous and important,\r\n and consequently such is the extent and magnitude of the work\r\n itself, as to put its publication beyond any means which the\r\n Society can command. Under these circumstances, your Committee\r\n learn with pleasure that preliminary arrangements have been made\r\n for its publication by the Smithsonian Institution, among its\r\n ‘Contributions to Knowledge.’ It can only be a matter of sincere\r\n gratification to this Society, to see that which it cannot itself\r\n accomplish for the history and antiquities of our country, taken\r\n up and carried out under such favorable auspices; and they cannot\r\n but rejoice that an opportunity is thus afforded to that noble\r\n institution of opening its high career, by fostering scientific\r\n research into the interesting problems connected with the\r\n Ante-Columbian history and Ancient Monuments of our own country.\r\n\r\n “In view of these facts, your Committee would recommend the adoption\r\n of the following resolutions by the Society:—\r\n\r\n “Resolved, That this Society regard the researches of Messrs. Squier\r\n and Davis, as of very great importance in American Archæology, and\r\n as casting much light upon our Aboriginal Antiquities, especially\r\n upon the character and habits of the earliest races which had their\r\n seat in the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n “Resolved, That we regard the work prepared upon this subject, as\r\n one of great general interest, and as worthy to be adopted for\r\n publication by the Smithsonian Institution, both as resting on\r\n original researches, and as affording remarkable illustrations of\r\n the history of the American Continent.\r\n\r\n “Your Committee would also append to this Report, the accompanying\r\n letters from Samuel G. Morton, M.D., of Philadelphia, and Hon.\r\n George P. Marsh, of Vermont, both members of this Society, and joint\r\n members of this Committee.\r\n\r\n “All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n «Committee.»\r\n    EDWARD ROBINSON,\r\n    JOHN R.

It is fortunate for the cause of American Archæology, that\r\nthe systematic attempt at its elucidation should have been conceived\r\nand executed in so truly philosophical a spirit; and, rich as this\r\nage already is in antiquarian lore, it has, I think, received few\r\nmore important contributions than that which the enlightened and\r\ngenerous zeal of these two private gentlemen is about to confer\r\nupon it. The Smithsonian Collection could not begin with a more\r\nappropriate or creditable essay; and I hope that every facility may\r\nbe afforded to the investigators, in bringing before the public the\r\nresults of their honorable labors, in as suitable a form and with as\r\nlittle delay as possible.\r\n\r\n (Signed)   GEO.

Site of Sculptured Rocks of the Guyandotte            299\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact of the existence, within the valley of the Mississippi river\r\nand its tributaries, of many ancient monuments of human labor and\r\nskill, seems to have escaped the notice of the adventurers who first\r\nmade known to the world the extent and fertility of that vast region.\r\nExcept some incidental allusions by La Vega, and the Portuguese\r\nchronicler of De Soto’s unfortunate expedition, to structures\r\nbearing some analogy to those of the West, (and which seem to have\r\nbeen occupied, if they were not built, by the Indians of Florida,)\r\nwe find no mention made of these monuments by any of the earlier\r\nexplorers. No sooner, however, had trade been opened with the Indians\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies, and the valley of the Mississippi begun to\r\nattract the attention of the rival nations that laid claim to this\r\ndivision of the continent, than the less prominent features of the\r\ncountry became subjects of observation and remark. Then, for the\r\nfirst time, we find these ancient monuments distinctly alluded to.\r\nIt was not however until some time afterwards, when settlements had\r\nbeen established at various prominent points within the valley, and\r\nthe tide of emigration began to flow thitherward, that any special\r\nattention was directed to them. Carver in 1776, and Hearte and others\r\nin 1791, were among the earliest of these observers at the North.\r\nTheir accounts, however, served scarcely to make known the existence\r\nof these remains, and failed to convey any clear idea of their\r\nextent or character. But as the country became better known and more\r\ndensely populated, notices of their existence became more numerous,\r\nand some detailed accounts of particular groups were presented to\r\nthe world, in the form of incidental notices in books of travel and\r\nlocal gazetteers, or in contributions to the pages of periodicals,\r\nand to the transactions of learned societies. HARRIS, in his “«Tour\r\ninto the Territory north-west of the Ohio»,” published in 1805,\r\nnoticed at considerable length the ancient remains at Marietta on\r\nthe Ohio river; and H. H. BRACKENRIDGE, one of the most accurate\r\nof the early explorers of the West, in his “«Views of Louisiana»,”\r\npublished in 1814, and in a paper in the first volume of the new\r\nseries of the Transactions of the “American Philosophical Society,”\r\npresented accounts of ancient remains at various points, together\r\nwith some general remarks upon our antiquities, distinguished for\r\ntheir comprehensiveness and sound philosophical spirit. Bishop\r\nMADISON of Virginia, in 1803, addressed to Dr. Barton, then Vice\r\nPresident of the American Philosophical Society, a communication of\r\nconsiderable length “upon the supposed fortifications of the western\r\ncountry,” which was published in the sixth volume of the old series\r\nof the Transactions of that institution. It contains some interesting\r\nfacts relative to the ancient remains found within the valley of\r\nthe great Kenhawa river, in Virginia, and is principally devoted\r\nto combating the popular notion that «all» the ancient earthworks\r\nwere of defensive origin. BARTRAM, in his animated Journal of\r\nTravels in Florida, published in 1779, makes frequent mention of the\r\nancient remains which fell under his notice. His accounts have been\r\namply confirmed by later observations, and they may be regarded as\r\npresenting a very accurate view of their general character. Previous\r\nto Bartram’s expedition, Adair, in his “Account of the American\r\nIndians,” published in 1775, mentioned the existence of these\r\nremains, but gave no details respecting them.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, DE WITT CLINTON, whose active mind neglected no department\r\nof inquiry, read a paper before the “Literary and Philosophical\r\nSociety of New York,” (an institution no longer existing,) upon the\r\n“Antiquities of the western part of New York,” which was subsequently\r\npublished in a pamphlet form. It gave a connected view of these\r\nantiquities so far as then known, and indicated their character with\r\nsuch clearness, as to identify them at once as belonging to that\r\nimposing class of remains found in the valley of the Mississippi.\r\nMCCAULEY, in his “«History of New York»,” published at a later\r\nperiod, (1829,) added considerably to the number of facts presented\r\nby Mr. CLINTON.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest and more important contributions to the general\r\nstock of information respecting the western monuments, is the\r\nchapter entitled “Antiquities,” contained in “«The Natural and\r\nStatistical View of Cincinnati and the Miami country»,” by DANIEL\r\nDRAKE, M.D., published in 1815. It not only embraces many facts,\r\nbut is free from the tendency towards exaggeration which has been\r\nthe prevailing fault of most that has been written upon the subject\r\nof American Antiquities. In connection with what was published by\r\nMr. BRACKENRIDGE, and at a subsequent date by the late President\r\nHARRISON, (Address before the Historical Society of Ohio, 1832,) it\r\npresents a better view of the ancient remains of the region north of\r\nthe Ohio, than can be obtained from any other source,—Mr. ATWATER’S\r\nMemoir, in the Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society,\r\nalone excepted.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, as it is unnecessary, particularly to\r\npoint out all that has been published upon this subject, chiefly\r\nconsisting, as it does, of detached and incidental observations.\r\nIn addition to the several authorities above named, we may mention\r\nLEWIS and CLARKE, Major LONG, Dr. EDWIN JAMES, HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT,\r\nTIMOTHY FLINT, HUGH WILLIAMSON, Dr. BARTON, Rev. JOSEPH DODDRIDGE,\r\nPresident JEFFERSON, Dr. LEWIS C. BECK, Dr. S. P. HILDRETH, KEATING,\r\nHAYWOOD, HOWE, NUTTALL, LATROBE, ROCHEFAUCAULT, SHORT, COLLINS,\r\nDICKESON, BROWN, FEATHERSTONHAUGH, Professors GERARD TROOST, JOHN\r\nLOCKE, and C. G. FORSHEY, R. C. and S. TAYLOR, Prince MAXIMILIAN,\r\nProf. RAFINESQUE, CHARLES WHITTLESEY, etc., etc., as among those\r\nwho have contributed to the general stock of information upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt towards a general account of the ancient\r\nmonuments of the West, was made by Mr. CALEB ATWATER, who deserves\r\nthe credit of being the pioneer in this department. His Memoir,\r\nconstituting 150 octavo pages, was published in the first volume\r\nof the “Archæologia Americana,” in 1819. It contains plans and\r\ndescriptions of a considerable number of ancient works,—embracing the\r\nimposing structures at Marietta, Newark, Portsmouth, Circleville,\r\netc., etc.,—with accounts of a variety of ancient remains found in\r\nthe mounds. It gives a better conception of the number, magnitude,\r\nand more obvious characteristics of the monuments treated of, than\r\nwas before possessed, and for a time appeared to have satisfied\r\npublic inquiry. It contains many errors, for which however we can\r\nfind a ready apology in the unsettled state of the country, and\r\nthe attendant difficulties of investigation at the time it was\r\nwritten,—errors which, under present advantages of research, would be\r\ninexcusable.\r\n\r\nThe facts presented by the earlier of the authorities above named,\r\nhave been collected by various authors, either in support of a\r\nfavorite hypothesis, or with a view of conveying to the world some\r\nconception of the antiquities of our country. These compilations,\r\nhowever, have proved eminently unsatisfactory, not less from the\r\nvague nature of the original accounts, than from the circumstance\r\nthat they were in most instances mixed up with the crudest\r\nspeculations and the wildest conjectures. Even when this was not\r\nthe case, the fact that the original observations were made in a\r\ndisconnected and casual manner, served still further to confuse the\r\nmind of the student and render generalization impossible. It was\r\nunder an impression of existing deficiencies in these respects,—the\r\npaucity of facts, and the loose manner in which most of them had\r\nbeen presented,—that the investigations recorded in this memoir\r\nwere commenced and prosecuted. At the outset, as indispensable to\r\nindependent judgment, all preconceived notions were abandoned,\r\nand the work of research commenced «de novo», as if nothing had\r\nbeen known or said concerning the remains to which attention was\r\ndirected. It was concluded that if these monuments were capable of\r\nreflecting any certain light upon the grand archæological questions\r\nconnected with the primitive history of the American Continent, the\r\norigin, migrations and early state of the American race, that then\r\nthey should be more carefully and minutely, and above all, more\r\nsystematically investigated.\r\n\r\nThe locality chosen for the commencement of operations, is a section\r\nof the Scioto river and Paint creek valleys, of which the city of\r\nChillicothe is the centre, and which possesses a deserved celebrity\r\nfor its beauty, unexampled fertility, and the great number, size, and\r\nvariety of its ancient remains. Situated in the middle of southern\r\nOhio, and possessing a mild and salubrious climate, this seems to\r\nhave been one of the centres of ancient population; and, probably,\r\nno other equal portion of the Mississippi basin furnishes so rich\r\nand interesting a field for the antiquarian. A glance at the “«Map\r\nof a Section of Twelve Miles of the Scioto Valley, with its Ancient\r\nMonuments»,” Plate II, will fully illustrate this remark.\r\n\r\nThe plan of operations was agreed upon, and the field-work commenced,\r\nearly in the spring of 1845. Subsequently, the plan was greatly\r\nextended, and the investigations were carried on, over Ohio and the\r\nadjacent States, with slight interruption, up to the summer of 1847.\r\n\r\nThe body of this memoir will indicate with sufficient clearness, the\r\nmode in which these investigations were conducted, and the extent to\r\nwhich they were prosecuted. It is perhaps enough here to say, that\r\nthe surveys of ancient works were, for the most part, made by the\r\nauthors in person, and that the excavations of mounds, etc., were all\r\nof them conducted under their personal direction and supervision.\r\nCare was exercised to note down, on the spot, every fact which it\r\nwas thought might be of value, in the solution of the problems of\r\nthe origin and purposes of the remains under notice; and particular\r\nattention was bestowed in observing the dependencies of the position,\r\nstructure, and contents of the various works in respect to each other\r\nand the general features of the country. Indeed, no exertion was\r\nspared to ensure entire accuracy, and the compass, line, and rule\r\nwere alone relied upon, in all matters where an approximate estimate\r\nmight lead to erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe ancient enclosures and groups of works personally examined or\r\nsurveyed, are upwards of one hundred in number. Some of these had\r\nbefore been noticed, but most are now for the first time presented\r\nto the world. About two hundred mounds, of all forms and sizes,\r\nand occupying every variety of position, have also been excavated.\r\nSeveral thousand remains of ancient art were collected in the course\r\nof these investigations, chiefly from the mounds themselves. These\r\nconstitute a cabinet, as valuable in its extent, as it is interesting\r\nin the great variety and singular character of the illustrations\r\nwhich it furnishes of the condition of the minor arts, and the\r\nconnections and communications of the people by whom these monuments\r\nwere erected.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of these researches naturally led to an acquaintance\r\nand correspondence with a large number of gentlemen in various\r\nparts of the Union, who felt interested in them, or who had devoted\r\nattention to the same subject. All of these have kindly rendered\r\ntheir services in cases where they could prove of value, or have\r\nfreely contributed the results of their own labors to complete the\r\ndesign of the authors, in presenting as full and comprehensive a view\r\nof the ancient monuments of our country, as private means and limited\r\nfacilities would allow.\r\n\r\nFirst among these, it will not be invidious to name JAMES MCBRIDE,\r\nEsq., of Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio, whose valuable contributions\r\nconstitute an important feature in the memoir herewith presented.\r\nThis gentleman, residing for a long time in the centre of the fertile\r\nvalley of the Great Miami river, amidst the numerous evidences of\r\nancient population with which that valley abounds, has devoted\r\na large proportion of his time to their attentive examination.\r\nPersonally, and with the assistance of J. W. ERWIN, Esq., resident\r\nengineer on the Miami canal, he has made numerous surveys of ancient\r\nenclosures and groups of works in that valley, distinguished for\r\ntheir minute fidelity. He also, without however resorting very\r\nextensively to direct excavations, has collected an interesting\r\ncabinet of aboriginal relics. Anxious to contribute his share to\r\nwhatever might elucidate the subject of American Archæology, Mr.\r\nMCBRIDE, with a generous liberality, placed in the hands of the\r\nauthors his notes, plans, and drawings, without restriction, to be\r\nused as they deemed proper. This tender was accepted in the same\r\nspirit it was made, and the materials thus furnished have been freely\r\nused in the succeeding pages, where they rank second to none in\r\ninterest and value.\r\n\r\nAmong the most zealous investigators in the field of American\r\nantiquarian research, is CHARLES WHITTLESEY, Esq., of Cleveland,\r\nformerly Topographic Engineer of Ohio. His surveys and observations,\r\ncarried on for many years and over a wide field, have been both\r\nnumerous and accurate, and are among the most valuable, in all\r\nrespects, of any hitherto made. Although Mr. Whittlesey, in\r\nconjunction with JOSEPH SULLIVANT, Esq., of Columbus, Ohio,\r\noriginally contemplated a joint work, in which the results of his\r\ninvestigations should be embodied, he has nevertheless, with a\r\nliberality which will be not less appreciated by the public than\r\nby the authors, contributed to this memoir about twenty plans of\r\nancient works, which, with the accompanying explanations and general\r\nobservations, will be found embodied in the following pages. Relating\r\nprincipally to the aboriginal monuments of northern Ohio, (as do\r\nthose of Mr. McBride to the remains of western Ohio,) they contribute\r\nmuch to the interest and completeness of this memoir. It is to be\r\nhoped the public may yet be put in possession of the entire results\r\nof Mr. Whittlesey’s labor, which could not fail of adding greatly to\r\nour stock of knowledge on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment is also due to Rev. R. MORRIS, of Mount Sylvan,\r\nLafayette county, Mississippi, for valuable facts relating to the\r\nmonuments of the South. Although but recently commenced, Mr. Morris’s\r\ninvestigations have been prosecuted in a manner which gives promise\r\nof important results.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that several plans and notices of ancient works\r\nare presented in the succeeding chapters, upon the authority of the\r\nlate Prof. C. S. RAFINESQUE. This gentleman, while living, devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to the antiquities of the Mississippi valley,\r\nand published several brief papers relating to them. His notes\r\nand plans, for the most part brief, crude, and imperfect, at his\r\ndeath found their way into the possession of BRANTZ MAYER, Esq., of\r\nBaltimore, late Secretary of the American Legation to Mexico. This\r\ngentleman placed them in the hands of the authors, with liberty to\r\nmake use of the information which they contained. They, however,\r\nhave chosen to avail themselves of this permission, only so far as\r\nto adopt Prof. Rafinesque’s plans, etc., in cases where they have\r\neither been able to verify them in person, or to assure themselves by\r\ncollateral evidence of their accuracy in all essential particulars.\r\nHis notes are principally important, as indicating the localities of\r\nmany interesting monuments, rather than as conveying any satisfactory\r\ninformation concerning them.\r\n\r\nTo SAMUEL GEORGE MORTON, M.D., of Philadelphia, the eminent author\r\nof “«Crania Americana»,” is acknowledgment especially due, not only\r\nfor the warm interest manifested in these investigations from their\r\ncommencement, but for the use of valuable manuscripts relating to\r\nour antiquities,—the collections of many years of laborious research\r\nin collateral departments. Among these is the brief account of the\r\nancient remains on the Wateree river in South Carolina, by Dr.\r\nWILLIAM BLANDING; and also the highly important account of the\r\nmonuments of the States bordering the Gulf of Mexico, by WILLIAM\r\nBARTRAM, the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical\r\nforests of Florida. The history of the MSS. from which the latter\r\naccount was taken, is unknown. It found its way by accident into the\r\nhands of its present possessor. It consists of answers to a series of\r\nquestions, by a second person, (probably Dr. Barton,) relating to the\r\nhistory, religion, manners, institutions, etc., of the tribes which\r\ncomposed the Creek confederacy, and is undoubtedly the most complete\r\nand accurate account of those Indians in existence.\r\n\r\nDr. S. P. HILDRETH, of Marietta, and Prof. JOHN LOCKE, of Cincinnati,\r\nboth of whom have devoted much attention to our antiquities,\r\nand whose observations upon the subject are distinguished for\r\ntheir accuracy, are also entitled to honorable mention for facts\r\ncontributed, and assistance rendered. So also, for surveys of ancient\r\nworks, drawings and descriptions of ancient relics, and facts of\r\nvarious kinds, is acknowledgment due to J. DILLE, Esq., of Newark,\r\nOhio; S. T. OWEINS and W. B. FAIRCHILD, Esqs., of Xenia, Ohio; Col.\r\nB. L. C. WAILES, of Washington, Mississippi; J. H. BLAKE, Esq., of\r\nBoston; THOMAS REYNOLDS, M.D., of Brockville, Canada West; ARIUS\r\nNYE, Esq., and CHARLES SULLIVAN, Marietta, Ohio; HENRY HOWE, R.\r\nBUCHANAN, JOSEPH CLARKE, ERASMUS GEST, jr., and U. P. JAMES, Esqs.,\r\nof Cincinnati; J. E. WHARTON, Esq., of Wheeling, Virginia; DANIEL\r\nMORTON, Esq., of New York; L. K. DILLE, M.D., of Cedarville, Ohio;\r\nCHARLES O. TRACY, of Portsmouth, Ohio; Prof. W. W. MATHER, Jackson,\r\nOhio; Rev. W. B. STEVENS, Athens, Georgia; Hon. T. H. CLINGMAN, North\r\nCarolina; ASHEL AYLESWORTH, Granville, Ohio; P. N. WHITE, Esq.,\r\nCircleville, Ohio; C. J. ORTON, Lower Sandusky, Ohio; Lieut. JOHN\r\nH. ALLEN, now of Easton, Md.; T. B. HUNT, Esq., of New Haven; WM.\r\nF. CLEMSON, Esq., of Chillicothe, Ohio; and JOSEPH SULLIVANT, Esq.,\r\nColumbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAnd while rendering these acknowledgments, it is but proper to\r\nexpress the obligations which the authors of these investigations\r\nfeel themselves under to gentlemen in the various Atlantic cities,\r\nwho, if they have not been able to add to the number of facts\r\nhere presented, have nevertheless by their thorough appreciation\r\nof the subject, friendly encouragement, and disinterested aid,\r\nextended in various ways, facilitated this new attempt towards the\r\nelucidation of the antiquities of our own country. To the learned\r\nand venerable President of the American Ethnological Society, Hon.\r\nALBERT GALLATIN, the closing years of whose long, active, and useful\r\nlife have been closely and successfully devoted to researches in\r\nthe wide field of American Ethnological Science, are our grateful\r\nacknowledgments especially due. His assistance and enlightened\r\napprobation have had a controlling influence in sustaining and\r\ncarrying on these investigations. To JOHN R. BARTLETT, Esq., of New\r\nYork, Foreign Corresponding Secretary of the Ethnological Society,\r\ndistinguished for his zeal and energy in organizing and promoting\r\nhistorical and ethnological research, we cannot sufficiently express\r\nour obligations. His assistance, in a variety of ways, has been of\r\nvalue, especially in directing public attention to the importance\r\nof a subject, the extent and bearings of which were but imperfectly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nHon. GEO. P. MARSH, of Burlington, Vermont, whose disinterested\r\nexertions have mainly contributed to the appearance of this memoir\r\nin its present form, has kindly examined the following chapters and\r\ngiven them the benefit of his sound and critical judgment. To Prof.\r\nEDWARD ROBINSON, D.D., and to Prof. W. W. TURNER, both of New York,\r\nand both officers of the American Ethnological Society, are we also\r\nindebted. The gentleman last named has supervised the memoir, and\r\nhis suggestions have been deferred to with a readiness implying a\r\nconfidence in his critical abilities, which is shared alike by the\r\nauthors and by the public.\r\n\r\nTo Professors B. SILLIMAN and B. SILLIMAN, jr., of New Haven; Prof.\r\nJEFFRIES WYMAN, of Boston; Prof. LEWIS AGASSIZ, of Cambridge; S.\r\nF. HAVENS, Esq., Librarian of the American Antiquarian Society,\r\nWorcester; and to numerous other gentlemen in various parts of the\r\nUnion, and particularly to GEO. R. GLIDDON, Esq., whose lectures\r\nand publications upon the subject of Egyptian Archæology have\r\ngiven a new and powerful impulse to cognate researches in America,\r\nand invested them with a popular interest indispensable to their\r\nsuccessful prosecution,—to all of these are the warmest thanks of the\r\ninvestigators due.\r\n\r\nIt will not be improper here to mention, that the literary part of\r\nthe present work, the responsible task of arranging and embodying\r\nfor publication the original MSS. and other materials jointly got\r\ntogether in the course of these investigations, has devolved mostly\r\nupon the gentleman whose name stands first upon the title-page, who\r\nhas also prepared the plans, drawings, and other illustrations. The\r\nother gentleman has been engaged for a number of years in researches\r\nconnected with our ancient monuments, and in collecting relics of\r\naboriginal art; and it is due to him to say, that the investigations\r\nhere recorded, so far as they involve inquiries in natural science,\r\nhave principally been made by him. He has also sustained the larger\r\nproportion of the expenses attending these explorations, and devoted\r\nconsiderable time to the restoration and arrangement of the relics\r\nrecovered from the mounds.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these prefatory remarks,—already extended beyond\r\nthe original design,—we may be permitted to say that it has been\r\na constant aim in the preparation of this memoir, to present\r\nfacts in a clear and concise form, with such simple deductions\r\nand generalizations alone, as may follow from their careful\r\nconsideration. With no hypothesis to combat or sustain, and with a\r\ndesire only to arrive at truth, whatever its bearings upon received\r\ntheories and current prejudices, everything like mere speculation\r\nhas been avoided. Analogies, apparently capable of reflecting light\r\nupon many important questions connected with an enlarged view of\r\nthe subject, have seldom been more than indicated. Their full\r\nconsideration, as also that of the relations which the ancient\r\nmonuments of the Mississippi valley bear to those of other portions\r\nof America and the world, has not been attempted here. To such an\r\nundertaking, involving long and careful research, as also a more\r\ncomprehensive view of the monuments of the central parts of the\r\ncontinent, this memoir is only preliminary. It yet remains to be seen\r\nwhether all the ancient monuments of the Mississippi valley were\r\nconstructed upon similar principles; whether they denote a common\r\norigin, and whether they were probably contemporaneous or otherwise\r\nin their erection. It remains to be settled whether the singular and\r\nanomalous structures of Wisconsin and the North-west are part of the\r\nsame grand system of defensive, religious, and sepulchral monuments\r\nfound in the valley of the Ohio, and the more imposing, if not more\r\nregular remains which abound in the Southern States. The work of\r\ninvestigation has been just commenced; its future progress may, and\r\nno doubt will, result in new and perhaps more important disclosures\r\nthan any hitherto made.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a complete and speedy examination of the whole\r\nfield, cannot be over-estimated. The operations of the elements,\r\nthe shifting channels of the streams, the levelling hand of public\r\nimprovement, and most efficient of all, the slow but constant\r\nencroachments of agriculture, are fast destroying these monuments of\r\nancient labor, breaking in upon their symmetry and obliterating their\r\noutlines. Thousands have already disappeared, or retain but slight\r\nand doubtful traces of their former proportions. Such an examination\r\nis, however, too great an undertaking for private enterprise to\r\nattempt. It must be left to local explorers, to learned associations,\r\nor to the Government. And if this memoir shall succeed in directing\r\nthat attention to the subject which it merits, and thereby in some\r\nmanner secure the thorough investigation of these monuments, that\r\nresult will prove an ample recompense for labors performed in a field\r\nof absorbing interest, and one which holds out abundant attractions\r\nto the Antiquary and Archæologist.\r\n\r\nCHILLICOTHE, OHIO, «June», 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p001]\r\n\r\n ANCIENT MONUMENTS.\r\n CHAPTER I.\r\n GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient monuments of the Western United States consist, for the\r\nmost part, of elevations and embankments of earth and stone, erected\r\nwith great labor and manifest design. In connection with these, more\r\nor less intimate, are found various minor relics of art, consisting\r\nof ornaments and implements of many kinds, some of them composed of\r\nmetal, but most of stone.\r\n\r\nThese remains are spread over a vast extent of country. They are\r\nfound on the sources of the Alleghany, in the western part of the\r\nState of New-York, on the east; and extend thence westwardly along\r\nthe southern shore of Lake Erie, and through Michigan and Wisconsin,\r\nto Iowa and the Nebraska territory, on the west.[1] We have no record\r\nof their occurrence above the great lakes. Carver mentions some\r\non the shores of Lake Pepin, and some are said to occur near Lake\r\nTravers, under the 46th parallel of latitude. Lewis and Clarke saw\r\nthem on the Missouri river, one thousand miles above its junction\r\nwith the Mississippi; and they have been observed on the Kanzas\r\nand Platte, and on other remote western rivers. They are found all\r\nover the intermediate country, and spread over the valley of the\r\nMississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. They line the shores of the Gulf\r\nfrom Texas to Florida, and extend, in diminished numbers, into South\r\nCarolina. They occur in great numbers in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Texas. They are found,\r\nin less numbers, in the western portions of New-York, Pennsylvania,\r\nVirginia, and North and South Carolina; as also in Michigan, Iowa,\r\nand in the Mexican territory beyond the Rio Grande del Norte. In\r\nshort, [p002] they occupy the entire basin of the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries, as also the fertile plains along the Gulf.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact but recently made known, that there are an abundance\r\nof small mounds, or tumuli, in the territory of Oregon. We are not\r\ninformed, however, whether there are any enclosures, or other works\r\nof like character with those usually accompanying the mounds of the\r\nMississippi valley, nor whether the mounds of Oregon are generally\r\ndisseminated over that territory.[2] That they are of frequent\r\noccurrence upon the river Gila, in California, and also upon the\r\ntributaries of the Colorado of the West, is also a fact but recently\r\nascertained. Whether these mounds possess features identifying them\r\nwith those of the Mississippi valley, or indicating a common origin,\r\nremains to be decided.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood that these works are dispersed equally\r\nover the area above indicated. They are mainly confined to the\r\nvalleys of the rivers and large streams, and seldom occur very far\r\nback from them. Occasional works are found in the hill or broken\r\ncountry; but they are not frequent, and are always of small size.\r\n\r\nAlthough possessing throughout certain general points of resemblance,\r\ngoing to establish a kindred origin, these works, nevertheless,\r\nresolve themselves into three grand geographical divisions, which\r\npresent, in many respects, striking contrasts, yet so gradually\r\nmerge into each other, that it is impossible to determine where one\r\nseries terminates and the other begins. In the region bordering the\r\nupper lakes, to a certain extent in Michigan, Iowa, and Missouri, but\r\nparticularly in Wisconsin, we find a succession of remains, entirely\r\nsingular in their form, and presenting but slight analogy to any\r\nothers of which we have an account, in any portion of the globe. The\r\nlarger proportion of these are structures of earth, bearing the forms\r\nof beasts, birds, reptiles, and even of men; they are frequently of\r\ngigantic dimensions, constituting huge «basso-relievos» upon the face\r\nof the country. They are very numerous, and in most cases occur in\r\nlong and apparently dependent ranges. In connection with them, are\r\nfound many conical mounds and occasional short lines of embankment,\r\nin rare instances forming enclosures. These animal effigies are\r\nmainly confined to Wisconsin, and extend across that territory from\r\nFond du Lac, in a south-western direction, ascending the Fox river,\r\nand following the general course of Rock and Wisconsin rivers to the\r\nMississippi. They may be much more extensively disseminated; but it\r\nis here only that they have been observed in considerable numbers. In\r\nMichigan, as also in Iowa and Missouri, similar elevations, of more\r\nor less regular outline, are said to occur. They are represented as\r\n[p003] dispersed in ranges, like the buildings of a modern city,\r\nand covering sometimes an area of many acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II. Map of a section of twelve miles of the Scioto\r\nValley with its ancient monuments.]\r\n\r\nFurther to the southward, in the region watered by the Ohio and its\r\ntributaries, we find ancient works of greater magnitude and more\r\nmanifest design. Among them are a few animal-shaped structures; but\r\nthey seem to have been erected on different principles and for a\r\ndifferent purpose from those just noticed. Here we find numberless\r\nmounds, most of them conical but many pyramidal in form, and often\r\nof great dimensions. The pyramidal structures are always truncated,\r\nsometimes terraced, and generally have graded ascents to their\r\nsummits. They bear a close resemblance to the Teocallis of Mexico;\r\nand the known uses of the latter are suggestive of the probable\r\npurposes to which they were applied. Accompanying these, and in some\r\ninstances sustaining an intimate relation to them, are numerous\r\nenclosures of earth and stone, frequently of vast size, and often\r\nof regular outline. These are by far the most imposing class of our\r\naboriginal remains, and impress us most sensibly with the numbers\r\nand power of the people who built them. The purposes of many of\r\nthese are quite obvious; and investigation has served to settle,\r\npretty clearly, the character of most of the other works occurring in\r\nconnection with them.\r\n\r\nProceeding still further southwards, we find, in the States bordering\r\non the Gulf of Mexico, the mounds increasing in size and regularity\r\nof form, if not in numbers. Conical mounds become comparatively rare,\r\nand the Teocalli-shaped structures become larger and more numerous,\r\nand assume certain dependencies in respect to each other, not before\r\nobserved. The enclosures, on the other hand, diminish in size and\r\nnumbers; and lose many of the characteristic features of those of\r\na higher latitude, though still sustaining towards them a strong\r\ngeneral resemblance. Here, for the first time, we find traces of\r\nbricks in the mounds and in the walls of enclosures.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of these several divisions will be more\r\nparticularly pointed out in the progress of this work; when the\r\npoints of resemblance and difference will become more apparent.\r\nThe succeeding observations relate more especially to the remains\r\nincluded in the central geographical section above indicated, where\r\nthe investigations recorded in this volume were principally carried\r\non, and which, in the extent, variety, and interesting nature of its\r\nancient monuments, affords by far the richest and most important\r\nfield for archæological research and inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe number of these ancient remains is well calculated to excite\r\nsurprise, and has been adduced in support of the hypothesis that\r\nthey are most, if not all of them, natural formations, “the\r\nresults of diluvial action,” modified perhaps in some instances,\r\nbut never erected by man. Of course no such suggestion was ever\r\nmade by individuals who had enjoyed the opportunity of seeing and\r\ninvestigating them. Simple structures of earth could not possibly\r\nbear more palpable evidences of an artificial origin, than do most of\r\nthe western monuments. The evidences in support of this assertion,\r\nderived from the form, structure, position, and contents of these\r\nremains, will sufficiently appear in the progress of this work.\r\n\r\nPLATE II, «exhibiting a section of twelve miles of the Scioto valley,\r\nwith its ancient» [p004] «monuments», will serve to give some\r\ngeneral conception of the number of these remains. The enclosures are\r\nhere indicated by dark lines, the mounds by simple dots. Within the\r\nsection represented, it will be observed that there are not less than\r\n«ten» groups of large works, accompanied by a great number of mounds,\r\nof various sizes. Within the enclosure designated by the letter E are\r\nembraced twenty-four mounds. The enclosures D, H, I, K, have each\r\nabout two and a half miles of embankment; and H and K enclose but\r\nlittle less than one hundred acres each. It is proper to observe,\r\nto prevent misconception, that there are few sections of country\r\nof equal extent which embrace so large a number of ancient works.\r\nThe fertile valley of the Scioto river was a favorite resort of the\r\nancient people, and was one of the seats of their densest population.\r\nThe various works indicated in these maps, will be described at\r\nlength in the subsequent pages. An enlarged plan of the enclosure\r\ndesignated by the letter A is given on Plate XXIII; B, on Plate\r\nXVIII; C, Plate XVIII; D, Plate XVII; E and F, Plate XIX; G, Plate\r\nXXII; H, Plate XXI; I, Plate XVI; K, Plate XX.\r\n\r\nPLATE III, No. 1, «exhibits a section of six miles of the Valley\r\nof Paint Creek», a tributary of the Scioto river. The village of\r\nBourneville is ten miles west of Chillicothe. Within this limit are\r\nembraced three works of extraordinary size, besides several smaller\r\nones. The works, designated by the letters A and B, have each upwards\r\nof two miles of heavy embankment, and contain not far from one\r\nhundred acres. The stone work C has an area of one hundred and forty\r\nacres, enclosed within a wall upwards of two and a fourth miles long.\r\nEnlarged plans of the various works here indicated are given in the\r\nfollowing pages. A and B, Plate XXI; C, Plate IV; D and E, Plate XXX.\r\n\r\nPlate III, No. 2, «presents a section of six miles of the Great Miami\r\nvalley», included principally within the limits of Butler county,\r\nOhio. Not less than seven enclosures, of considerable size, occur\r\nwithin these bounds. The work indicated by the letter G contains\r\nninety-five acres. An enlarged plan of the work marked A, is given on\r\nPlate VI; of B, on Plate XI; C and F, on Plate XXX; D, Plate XXXI;\r\nand G, on Plate XIII.\r\n\r\nNot far from one hundred enclosures of various sizes, and five\r\nhundred mounds, are found in Ross county, Ohio. The number of tumuli\r\nin the State may be safely estimated at ten thousand, and the number\r\nof enclosures at one thousand or fifteen hundred. Many of them are\r\nsmall, but cannot be omitted in an enumeration. They are scarcely\r\nless numerous on the Kenhawas in Virginia, than on the Scioto and\r\nMiamis; and are abundant on the White river and Wabash, as also\r\nupon the Kentucky, Cumberland, Tennessee, and the numerous other\r\ntributaries of the Ohio and Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III. Map exhibiting a section of six miles of the\r\nGreat Miami Valley, with its ancient monuments.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Map exhibiting a section of six miles of the Paint Creek\r\nValley, with its ancient monuments.]\r\n\r\nNor is their magnitude less a matter of remark than their great\r\nnumber. Lines of embankment, varying in height from five to thirty\r\nfeet, and enclosing areas of from one to fifty acres, are common;\r\nwhile enclosures of one or two hundred acres area are far from\r\ninfrequent. Occasional works are found enclosing as many as [p005]\r\nfour hundred acres.[3] The magnitude of the area enclosed is not,\r\nhowever, always a correct index of the amount of labor expended in\r\nthe erection of these works. A fortified hill in Highland county,\r\nOhio, has one mile and five-eighths of heavy embankment; yet it\r\nencloses an area of only about forty acres. A similar work on the\r\nLittle Miami river, in Warren county, Ohio, has upwards of four miles\r\nof embankment, yet encloses little more than one hundred acres. The\r\ngroup of works at the mouth of the Scioto river has an aggregate of\r\nat least twenty miles of embankment; yet the entire amount of land\r\nembraced within the walls does not probably much exceed two hundred\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe mounds are of all dimensions, from those of but a few feet\r\nin height and a few yards in diameter, to those which, like the\r\ncelebrated structure at the mouth of Grave Creek in Virginia,\r\nrise to the height of seventy feet, and measure one thousand feet\r\nin circumference at the base. The great mound in the vicinity\r\nof Miamisburgh, Montgomery county, Ohio, is sixty-eight feet\r\nin perpendicular height, and eight hundred and fifty-two in\r\ncircumference at the base, containing 311,353 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Great Mound at Miamisburgh, Ohio.\r\n\r\nFrom a sketch by Henry Howe, Esq.]\r\n\r\nThe truncated pyramid at Cahokia, Illinois, has an altitude of\r\nninety feet, and is upwards of two thousand feet in circumference\r\nat the base. It has a level summit of several acres area. The great\r\nmound at Selserstown, Mississippi, is computed to cover six acres\r\nof ground. Mounds of these extraordinary dimensions are most common\r\nat the south, though there are some of great size at the north. The\r\nusual dimensions are, however, considerably less than in the examples\r\nhere given. The greater number range from six to thirty feet in\r\nperpendicular height, by forty to one hundred feet diameter at the\r\nbase.[4] [p006]\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned constructions are composed of earth or\r\nstone; though a combination of these materials in the same work is\r\nby no means rare. When there are no ditches interior or exterior to\r\nthe embankments, «pits» or “dug holes,” from which the earth for\r\ntheir formation was taken, are generally visible near by. These are\r\nsometimes very broad and deep, and occasionally quite symmetrical\r\nin shape.[5] In the vicinity of large mounds such excavations are\r\ncommon. The earth and stone composing these works are sometimes\r\nforeign to the locality which they occupy, and must have been brought\r\nfrom considerable distances.\r\n\r\nA large, perhaps the larger, portion of these enclosures are\r\nregular in outline, the square and the circle predominating. Some\r\nare parallelograms, some ellipses, others polygons, regular or\r\nirregular. The regular works are almost invariably erected on level\r\nriver-terraces, great care having evidently been taken to select\r\nthose least broken. The irregular works are those which partake most\r\nof the character of defences, and are usually made to conform to the\r\nnature of the ground upon which they are situated,—running along\r\nthe brows of hills, or cutting off the approaches to strong natural\r\npositions. The square and the circle often occur in combination,\r\nfrequently communicating with each other or with irregular works\r\ndirectly, or by avenues consisting of parallel lines of embankment.\r\nDetached parallels are numerous. The mounds are usually simple cones\r\nin form; but they are sometimes truncated, and occasionally terraced,\r\nwith graded or winding ascents to their summits. Some are elliptical,\r\nothers pear-shaped, and others squares or parallelograms, with\r\nflanking terraces. Besides these, there are others already alluded\r\nto, most common in the extreme north-west, which assume the forms of\r\nanimals and reptiles. Another variety of remains are the causeways or\r\n“roads,” and the graded descents to rivers and streams, or from one\r\nterrace to another. These several classes of works will be described\r\nat length, under appropriate heads.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, these remains occur mainly in the valleys\r\nof the Western rivers and streams. The alluvial terraces, or\r\n“river-bottoms,” as they are popularly termed, were the favorite\r\nsites of the builders. The principal monuments are found where these\r\n“bottoms” are most extended, and where the soil is most fertile and\r\neasy of cultivation. At the junction of streams, where the valleys\r\nare usually broadest and most favorable for their erection, some\r\nof the largest and most singular remains are found. The works at\r\nMarietta; at the junction of the Muskingum with the Ohio; at the\r\nmouth of Grave Creek; at Portsmouth, the mouth of the Scioto; and\r\nat the mouth of the Great Miami, are instances in point. Occasional\r\nworks are found on the hill tops, overlooking the valleys, or at\r\na little distance from them; but these are manifestly, in most\r\ninstances, works of defence or last resort, or in some way connected\r\nwith warlike purposes. And it is worthy of remark, that the sites\r\nselected for settlements, towns, and cities, by the invading\r\nEuropeans, are often those which were the especial favorites of the\r\nmound-builders, and the seats of their heaviest population. Marietta,\r\nNewark, Portsmouth, Chillicothe, [p007] Circleville, and Cincinnati,\r\nin Ohio; Frankfort in Kentucky; and St. Louis in Missouri, may be\r\nmentioned in confirmation of this remark. The centres of population\r\nare now, where they were at the period when the mysterious race of\r\nthe mounds flourished.[6]\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal monuments of the Mississippi valley, the general\r\ncharacter of which has been thus briefly and imperfectly indicated,\r\nfall within two general divisions, namely, CONSTRUCTIONS OF EARTH OR\r\nSTONE, comprising «Enclosures, Mounds, etc.»; and MINOR VESTIGES OF\r\nART, including the «Implements, Ornaments, Sculptures, etc.» of the\r\nancient people.\r\n\r\nThe Earth and Stone Works resolve themselves into two classes, viz:\r\nENCLOSURES, bounded by embankments, circumvallations, or walls; and\r\nsimple tumuli, or MOUNDS.[7] They constitute, together, a single\r\nsystem of works; but, for reasons which will satisfactorily appear,\r\nit is preferred to classify them as above. These grand classes\r\nresolve themselves into other subordinate divisions: ENCLOSURES FOR\r\nDEFENCE, SACRED AND MISCELLANEOUS ENCLOSURES; MOUNDS OF SACRIFICE,\r\nTEMPLE MOUNDS, MOUNDS OF SEPULTURE, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Some ancient works, probably belonging to the same system with\r\nthose of the Mississippi valley, and erected by the same people,\r\noccur upon the Susquehanna river, as far down as the Valley of\r\nWyoming, in Pennsylvania. The mound-builders seem to have skirted the\r\nsouthern border of Lake Erie, and spread themselves, in diminished\r\nnumbers, over the western part of the State of New-York, along the\r\nshores of Lake Ontario to the St. Lawrence river. They penetrated\r\ninto the interior, eastward, as far as the county of Onondaga, where\r\nsome slight vestiges of their works still exist. These seem to have\r\nbeen their limits at the north-east.\r\n\r\n[2] The only reference we have to the mounds of Oregon is contained\r\nin a paragraph in the Narrative of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition, vol. iv. p. 313:\r\n\r\n“We soon reached the Bute Prairies, which are extensive, and covered\r\nwith tumuli, or small mounds, at regular distances asunder. As far as\r\nI can learn, there is no tradition among the natives concerning them.\r\nThey are conical mounds, thirty feet in diameter, about six or seven\r\nfeet above the level, and «many thousands in number». Being anxious\r\nto ascertain if they contained any relics, I subsequently visited\r\nthese prairies, and opened three of the mounds, but found nothing in\r\nthem but a pavement of round stones.”\r\n\r\n[3] Lewis and Clarke describe one on the Missouri river which they\r\nestimated to contain not far from six hundred acres.—«Travels», p. 47.\r\n\r\n[4] “We have seen mounds which would require the labor of a thousand\r\nmen employed upon our canals, with all their mechanical aids, and the\r\nimproved implements of their labor, for months. We have more than\r\nonce hesitated, in view of one of these prodigious mounds, whether\r\nit were not really a natural hill. But they are uniformly so placed,\r\nin reference to the adjacent country, and their conformation is so\r\nunique and similar, that no eye hesitates long in referring them to\r\nthe class of artificial erections.”—«Flint’s Geography», p. 131.\r\n\r\n[5] These are the “«wells»” of Mr. Atwater and other writers on\r\nAmerican antiquities. It is barely possible that a few were really\r\nwells, or «secondarily» designed for reservoirs.\r\n\r\n[6] “The most dense ancient population existed in precisely the\r\nplaces where the most crowded future population will exist in ages to\r\ncome. The appearance of a series of mounds generally indicates the\r\ncontiguity of rich and level lands, easy communications, fish, game,\r\nand the most favorable adjacent positions.”—«Flint.»\r\n\r\n“The most numerous, as well as the most considerable of these remains\r\nare found precisely in any part of the country where the traces of a\r\nnumerous population might be looked for.”—«Brackenridge.»\r\n\r\n[7] The term «Mound» is used in this work in a technical sense, as\r\nsynonymous with «Tumulus» or «Barrow», and in contradistinction to\r\nembankment, wall, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p008]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER  II.\r\n EARTHWORKS—ENCLOSURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Enclosures, or, as they are familiarly called throughout the\r\nWest, “Forts,” constitute a very important and interesting class\r\nof remains. Their dimensions, and the popular opinion as to their\r\npurposes, attract to them more particularly the attention of\r\nobservers. As a consequence, most that has been written upon our\r\nantiquities relates to them. A considerable number have been surveyed\r\nand described by different individuals, at different times; but\r\nno systematic examination of a sufficient number to justify any\r\ngeneral conclusion as to their origin and purposes has heretofore\r\nbeen attempted. We have therefore had presented as many different\r\nhypotheses as there have been individual explorers; one maintaining\r\nthat all the enclosures were intended for defence, while another\r\npersists that none could possibly have been designed for any such\r\npurpose. Investigation has shown, however, that while certain works\r\npossess features demonstrating incontestibly a military origin,\r\nothers were connected with the superstitions of the builders, or\r\ndesigned for other purposes not readily apparent in our present state\r\nof knowledge concerning them.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that the square and the circle, separate\r\nor in combination, were favorite figures with the mound-builders;\r\nand a large proportion of their works in the Scioto valley, and in\r\nOhio generally, are of these forms. Most of the circular works are\r\nsmall, varying from two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet in\r\ndiameter, while others are a mile or more in circuit. Some stand\r\nisolated, but most in connection with one or more mounds, of greater\r\nor less dimensions, or in connection with other more complicated\r\nworks. Wherever the circles occur, if there be a fosse, or ditch,\r\nit is almost invariably «interior» to the parapet. Instances are\r\nfrequent where no ditch is discernible, and where it is evident that\r\nthe earth composing the embankment was brought from a distance,\r\nor taken up evenly from the surface. In the square and in the\r\nirregular works, if there be a fosse at all, it is «exterior» to the\r\nembankment; except in the case of fortified hills, where the earth,\r\nfor the best of reasons, is usually thrown from the interior. These\r\nfacts are not without their importance in determining the character\r\nand purpose of these remains. Another fact, bearing directly upon\r\nthe degree of knowledge possessed by the builders, is, that many, if\r\nnot most, of the circular works are «perfect circles», and that many\r\nof the rectangular works are «accurate squares». This fact has been\r\ndemonstrated, in numerous instances, by careful admeasurements; and\r\nhas been remarked in cases where the works embrace an area of many\r\nacres, and where the embankments, or circumvallations, are a mile and\r\nupwards in extent. [p009]\r\n\r\nTo facilitate description, and to bring something like system out of\r\nthe disordered materials before us, the enclosures are, to as great a\r\ndegree as practicable, divided into classes; that is to say, such as\r\nare esteemed to be works of defence are placed together, while those\r\nwhich are regarded as sacred, or of a doubtful character, come under\r\nanother division.\r\n\r\n\r\n WORKS OF DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nThose works which are incontestibly defensive usually occupy strong\r\nnatural positions; and to understand fully their character, their\r\ncapability for defence, and the nature of their entrenchments, it\r\nis necessary to notice briefly the predominant features of the\r\ncountry in which they occur. The valley of the Mississippi river,\r\nfrom the Alleghanies to the ranges of the Rocky Mountains, is a\r\nvast sedimentary basin, and owes its general aspect to the powerful\r\nagency of water. Its rivers have worn their valleys deep into a\r\nvast original plain; leaving, in their gradual subsidence, broad\r\nterraces, which mark the eras of their history. The edges of the\r\ntable-lands, bordering on the valleys, are cut by a thousand ravines,\r\npresenting bluff headlands and high hills with level summits,\r\nsometimes connected by narrow isthmuses with the original table, but\r\noccasionally entirely detached. The sides of these elevations are\r\ngenerally steep, and difficult of access; in some cases precipitous\r\nand absolutely inaccessible. The natural strength of such positions,\r\nand their susceptibility of defence, would certainly suggest them\r\nas the citadels of a people having hostile neighbors, or pressed by\r\ninvaders. Accordingly we are not surprised at finding these heights\r\noccupied by strong and complicated works, the design of which is no\r\nless indicated by their position than by their construction. But in\r\nsuch cases, it is always to be observed, that they have been chosen\r\nwith great care, and that they possess peculiar strength, and have\r\na special adaptation for the purposes to which they were applied.\r\nThey occupy the highest points of land, and are never commanded\r\nfrom neighboring positions. While rugged and steep on most sides,\r\nthey have one or more points of comparatively easy approach, in the\r\nprotection of which the utmost skill of the builders seems to have\r\nbeen exhausted. They are guarded by double, overlapping walls, or\r\na series of them, having sometimes an accompanying mound, designed\r\nperhaps for a look-out, and corresponding to the barbican in the\r\nsystem of defence of the Britons of the middle era. The usual defence\r\nis a simple embankment, thrown up along and a little below the brow\r\nof the hill, varying in height and solidity, as the declivity is more\r\nor less steep and difficult of access.\r\n\r\nOther defensive works occupy the peninsulas created by the rivers\r\nand large [p010] streams, or cut off the headlands formed by their\r\njunction with each other. In such cases a fosse and wall are thrown\r\nacross the isthmus, or diagonally from the bank of one stream to the\r\nbank of the other. In some, the wall is double, and extends along the\r\nbank of the stream some distance inwardly, as if designed to prevent\r\nan enemy from turning the flanks of the defence.\r\n\r\nTo understand clearly the nature of the works last mentioned, it\r\nshould be remembered that the banks of the western rivers are\r\nalways steep, and where these works are located, invariably high.\r\nThe banks of the various terraces are also steep, and vary from\r\nten to thirty and more feet in height. The rivers are constantly\r\nshifting their channels; and they frequently cut their way through\r\nall the intermediate up to the earliest-formed, or highest terrace,\r\npresenting bold banks, inaccessibly steep, and from sixty to one\r\nhundred feet high. At such points, from which the river has, in some\r\ninstances, receded to the distance of half a mile or more, works of\r\nthis description are oftenest found.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a fact of much importance, and worthy of special note, that\r\nwithin the scope of a pretty extended observation, no work of any\r\nkind has been found occupying the first, or latest-formed terrace.\r\nThis terrace alone, except at periods of extraordinary freshets, is\r\nsubject to overflow.[8] The formation of each terrace constitutes\r\na sort of semi-geological era in the history of the valley; and\r\nthe fact that none of the ancient works occur upon the lowest or\r\nlatest-formed of these, while they are found indiscriminately upon\r\nall the others, bears directly upon the question of their antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the several descriptions of defensive works above\r\nenumerated, there are others presenting peculiar features, which\r\nwill be sufficiently noticed in the plans and explanations that\r\nfollow. These plans are all drawn from actual and minute, and in\r\nmost instances personal survey, and are presented, unless otherwise\r\nspecially noted, on a uniform scale of five hundred feet to the inch.\r\nWhen there are interesting features too minute to be satisfactorily\r\nindicated on so small a scale, enlarged plans have been adopted.\r\nThis is the case with the very first plan presented. Sections and\r\nsupplementary plans are given, whenever it is supposed they may\r\nillustrate the description, or assist the comprehension of the\r\nreader. To shorten the text, the admeasurements are often placed\r\nupon the plans, and the “Field Books” of survey wholly omitted.\r\nThe greatest care has, in all cases, been taken to secure perfect\r\nfidelity in all essential particulars. In the sectional maps, in\r\norder to show something of the character as well as the positions\r\nof the works, it has been found necessary to exaggerate them beyond\r\ntheir proportionate size. Some of the minor features of a few works\r\nare also slightly exaggerated, but in no case where it would be apt\r\nto lead to misapprehension or wrong conceptions of their character.\r\n[p011]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV. Ancient Stone Work near the village of\r\nBourneville, Ross Co. Ohio, 12 miles west of Chillicothe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE IV.[9]\r\n STONE WORK, NEAR BOURNEVILLE, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis work occupies the summit of a lofty, detached hill, twelve\r\nmiles westward from the city of Chillicothe, near the village\r\nof Bourneville. The hill is not far from four hundred feet in\r\nperpendicular height; and is remarkable, even among the steep hills\r\nof the West, for the general abruptness of its sides, which at some\r\npoints are absolutely inaccessible. It is the advance point of a\r\nrange of hills, situated between the narrow valleys of two small\r\ncreeks; and projects midway into the broad valley of Paint creek,\r\nso as to constitute its most prominent natural feature. It is a\r\nconspicuous object from every point of view. Its summit is a wide\r\nand fertile plain, with occasional considerable depressions, some of\r\nwhich contain water during the entire year.\r\n\r\nThe defences consist of a wall of stone which is carried around the\r\nhill, a little below the brow; but at some places it rises, so as to\r\ncut off the narrow spurs, and extends across the neck that connects\r\nthe hill with the range beyond. It should not be understood by the\r\nterm «wall», that, at this time, anything like a wall of stones\r\nregularly laid up exists; on the contrary, where the line is best\r\npreserved, there is little evidence that the stones were laid one\r\nupon the other so as to present vertical faces, much less that they\r\nwere cemented in place. At a few points, however, more particularly\r\nat the isthmus D, there are some indications of arrangement in the\r\nstones, tending to the belief that the wall here may have been\r\nregularly faced on the exterior. The appearance of the line, for the\r\nmost part, is just what might be expected from the «falling outwards»\r\nof a wall of stones placed, as this was, upon the declivity of a\r\nhill. Upon the western, or steepest face of the hill, the range of\r\nstones covers a space varying from thirty to fifty feet in width,\r\nclosely resembling the “«protection walls»” carried along the\r\nembankments of rail-roads and canals, where exposed to the action of\r\nrivers or large streams. But for the amount of stones, it might be\r\ntaken for a natural feature,—the «debris» of the out-cropping sand\r\nstrata. Such, certainly, is the first impression which it produces\r\nupon the visitor; an impression, however, which is speedily corrected\r\nupon reaching the points where the supposed line of «debris», rising\r\nupon the spurs, forms curved gateways, and then resumes its course as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nUpon the eastern face of the hill, where the declivity is least\r\nabrupt, the wall is heavier and more distinct than upon the west,\r\nresembling a long stone-heap of fifteen or twenty feet base, and\r\nfrom three to four feet in height. Where it crosses the isthmus\r\nit is heaviest; and although stones enough have been removed from\r\nit, [p012] at that point, to build a stout division wall between\r\nthe lands of two proprietors, their removal is not discoverable.\r\nThis isthmus is seven hundred feet wide, and the wall is carried\r\nin a right line across it, at its narrowest point. Here are three\r\ngateways opening upon the continuous terrace beyond. These are formed\r\nby the curving inward of the ends of the wall for forty or fifty\r\nfeet, leaving narrow pass-ways between, not exceeding eight feet in\r\nwidth. At the other points, A and C of the plan, where there are\r\njutting ridges, are similar gateways. It is at these points that\r\nthe hill is most easy of access. At A is a modern roadway; at C is\r\na pathway leading down into the valley of “Black Run.” At B appears\r\nto have been a similar gateway, which for some reason was closed\r\nup; a like feature may be observed in the line D. At the gateways,\r\nthe amount of stones is more than quadruple the quantity at other\r\npoints, constituting broad, mound-shaped heaps. They also exhibit the\r\nmarks of intense heat, which has in some instances vitrified their\r\nsurfaces, and fused them together. Light, porous scoriæ are abundant\r\nin the centres of some of these piles. Indeed, strong traces of fire\r\nare visible at many places on the line of the wall, particularly at\r\nF, the point commanding the broadest extent of country. Here are two\r\nor three small mounds of stone, which seem burned throughout. Nothing\r\nis more certain than that powerful fires have been maintained, for\r\nconsiderable periods, at numerous prominent points on the hill;\r\nfor what purposes, unless as alarm signals, it is impossible to\r\nconjecture.[10]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the wall is interrupted for some distance\r\nat E, where the hill is precipitous and inaccessible. There are, as\r\nhas already been remarked, several depressions upon the hill which\r\ncontain constant supplies of water. One of them covers about two\r\nacres, and furnishes a supply estimated by the proprietor as adequate\r\nto the wants of a thousand head of cattle. Water is obtained in\r\nabundance at the depth of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThe area enclosed within this singular work is something over one\r\nhundred and forty acres, and the line of the wall measures upwards of\r\n«two and a quarter miles» in length. Most of the wall, and a large\r\nportion of the area, are still covered with a heavy primitive forest.\r\nTrees of the largest size grow on the line, twisting their roots\r\namong the stones, some of which are firmly imbedded in their trunks.\r\n\r\nThat this work was designed for defence, will hardly admit of doubt;\r\nthe fact is sufficiently established, not less by the natural\r\nstrength of the position, than by the character of the defences. Of\r\nthe original construction of the wall, now so completely in ruins,\r\nwe can of course form no very clear conception. It is possible that\r\nit was once regularly laid up; but it seems that, if such were ever\r\nthe case, some satisfactory evidence of the fact would still be\r\ndiscoverable. We must consider, however, that it is situated upon a\r\nyielding and disintegrating declivity; and that successive forests,\r\nin their growth and prostration, aided by the action of the elements,\r\nin the long period which must certainly have elapsed since its [p013]\r\nconstruction, would have been adequate to the total demolition of\r\nstructures more solid and enduring than we are justified in supposing\r\nany of the stone works of the ancient people to have been. The stones\r\nare of all sizes, and sufficiently abundant to have originally formed\r\nwalls eight feet high, by perhaps an equal base. At some points,\r\nsubstantial fence-lines have been built from them, without sensibly\r\ndiminishing their numbers. It can readily be perceived that, upon\r\na steep declivity, such as this hill presents, so large an amount\r\nof stones, even though simply heaped together, must have proved\r\nan almost insurmountable impediment in the way of an assailant,\r\nespecially if they were crowned by palisades.\r\n\r\nIn the magnitude of the area enclosed, this work exceeds any\r\nhill-work now known in the country; although the wall is considerably\r\nless in length than that of “Fort Ancient,” on the Little Miami\r\nriver. It evinces great labor, and bears the impress of a numerous\r\npeople. The valley in which it is situated was a favorite one with\r\nthe race of the mounds; and the hill overlooks a number of extensive\r\ngroups of ancient works, the bearings of which are indicated by\r\narrows on the plan.\r\n\r\nPaint creek washes the base of the hill upon the left, and has for\r\nsome distance worn away the argillaceous slate rock, so as to leave\r\na mural front of from fifty to seventy-five feet in height. It has\r\nalso uncovered a range of «septaria», occurring near the base of the\r\nslate stratum; a number of which, of large size, are to be seen in\r\nthe bed of the creek, at «a». These, most unaccountably, have been\r\nmistaken for works of art,—“stone covers” for deep wells sunk in\r\nthe rock. This notion has been gravely advanced in print; and the\r\nhumble septaria, promoted to a high standing amongst the antiquities\r\nof America, now figure prominently in every work of speculations on\r\nthe subject. The reason for sinking wells in the bed of a creek, was\r\nprobably never very obvious to any mind. The supposed “wells” are\r\nsimple casts of huge septaria, which have been dislodged from their\r\nbeds; the cyclopean “covers” are septaria which have resisted the\r\ndisintegrating action of the water, and still retain their places.\r\nParallel ranges of these singular natural productions run through the\r\nslate strata of this region: they are of an oblate-spheroidal figure,\r\nsome of them measuring from nine to twelve feet in circumference.\r\nThey frequently have apertures or hollows in their middle, with\r\nradiating fissures, filled with crystalline spar or sulphate of\r\nbaryta. These fissures sometimes extend beyond them, in the slate\r\nrock, constituting the “good joints” mentioned by some writers.\r\nThe slate layers are not interrupted by these productions, but are\r\nbent or wrapped around them. The following cut illustrates their\r\ncharacter. A is a vertical section: «a» exhibiting the water, «b» the\r\nrock. At «c» the septarium has disintegrated, or has been removed,\r\nand its cavity or bed is filled with pebbles. At «d» the nodule still\r\nremains. B exhibits the appearance presented by «d» from above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nA stone work, somewhat similar in character to that here described,\r\nexists near the town of Somerset, Perry county, Ohio. It is described\r\nby Mr. Atwater in the Archæologia Americana, vol. i. p. 131. [p014]\r\n\r\nStill another, of small size and irregular outline, is situated on\r\nBeaver creek, a branch of the Great Kenhawa, in Fayette county,\r\nVirginia, of which an account was published by Mr. I. Craig of\r\nPittsburgh, in the “American Pioneer,” vol. i. p. 199.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE V.\r\n “FORT HILL,” HIGHLAND COUNTY, OHIO.[11]\r\n\r\nThis work occurs in the southern part of Highland county, Ohio; and\r\nis distant about thirty miles from Chillicothe, and twelve from\r\nHillsborough. It is universally known as “Fort Hill,” though no\r\nbetter entitled to the name than many others of similar character.\r\nThe defences occupy the summit of a hill, which is elevated five\r\nhundred feet above the bed of Brush creek at its base, and eight\r\nhundred feet above the Ohio river at Cincinnati. Unlike the hills\r\naround it, this one stands detached and isolated, and forms a\r\nconspicuous object from every approach. Its sides are steep and\r\nprecipitous; and, except at one or two points, if not absolutely\r\ninaccessible, extremely difficult of ascent. The points most easy of\r\naccess are at the southern and northern angles, and may be reached\r\non horseback. The top of the hill is level, and has an area of\r\nnot far from fifty acres, which is covered with a heavy primitive\r\nforest of gigantic trees. One of these, a chestnut, standing on the\r\nembankment near the point indicated by the letter «e», measures\r\n«twenty-one feet» in circumference; another, an oak, which also stood\r\non the wall, at the point «f», though now fallen and much decayed,\r\nstill measures «twenty-three feet» in circumference. All around are\r\nscattered the trunks of immense trees, in every stage of decay; the\r\nentire forest presenting an appearance of the highest antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V. Fort Hill, Highland Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThus much for its natural features. Running along the edge of the\r\nhill is an embankment of mingled earth and stone, interrupted at\r\nintervals by gateways. Interior to this is a ditch, from which the\r\nmaterial composing the wall was taken. The length of the wall is\r\neight thousand two hundred and twenty-four feet, or something over a\r\nmile and a half. In height, measuring from the bottom of the ditch,\r\nit varies from six to ten feet, though at some places it rises to\r\nthe height of fifteen feet. Its average base is thirty-five or forty\r\nfeet. It is thrown up somewhat below the brow of the hill, the level\r\nof the terrace being generally about even with the top of the wall;\r\nbut in some places it rises considerably above, as shown in the\r\nsections. The outer slope of the wall is more abrupt than that of the\r\nhill; the earth and stones from the ditch, sliding down fifty or a\r\nhundred feet, have formed a [p015] declivity for that distance, so\r\nsteep as to be difficult of ascent, even with the aid which the trees\r\nand bushes afford. The ditch has an average width of not far from\r\nfifty feet; and, in many places, is dug through the sandstone layer\r\nupon which the soil of the terrace rests.[12] At the point A, the\r\nrock is quarried out, leaving a mural front about twenty feet high.\r\nThe inner declivity of the ditch appears to have been terraced. It\r\ndescends abruptly from the level for a few feet, then declines gently\r\nfor some distance, and again dips suddenly, as it approaches the\r\nwall. The vertical section «a b» exhibits this feature.\r\n\r\nThere are «thirty-three» gateways or openings in the wall, most of\r\nthem very narrow, not exceeding fifteen or twenty feet in width at\r\nthe top: only eleven of these have corresponding causeways across\r\nthe ditch. They occur at irregular intervals; and some of them\r\nappear to have been rather designed to let off the water which\r\nmight otherwise accumulate in the ditch, than to serve as places of\r\negress or ingress. Indeed, most of them cannot be supposed to have\r\nbeen used for the last named purposes, inasmuch as they occur upon\r\nthe very steepest points of the hill, and where approach is almost\r\nimpossible. At the northern and southern spurs or angles of the hill,\r\nthe gateways are widest, and the parapet curves slightly outwards.\r\nThe ditch is interrupted at these points.\r\n\r\nThere are three depressions or ponds within the enclosure; the\r\nlargest of these, «g», has a well-defined artificial embankment on\r\nits lower side, which has recently been cut through, and the water\r\nprincipally drawn off. When full, the water must have covered very\r\nnearly an acre. Bog-clumps are growing around its edges, and it is\r\nfree from trees. It does not seem to have any perennial sources of\r\nsupply. There are several other small circular depressions, a number\r\nof which occur together at the bluff A; there are also traces of\r\nother excavations, not clearly defined, at various points on the hill.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the plan of the work, shows that it is naturally\r\ndivided into three parts; that at A being, in many respects, the\r\nmost remarkable. It is connected with the main body of the work by\r\na narrow ridge but one hundred feet wide, and terminates at a bold,\r\nbluff ledge, the top of which is thirty feet above the bottom of the\r\ntrench, and twenty feet above the wall. This bluff is two hundred\r\nfeet wide. It is altogether the most prominent point of the hill,\r\nand commands a wide extent of country. Here are strong traces of\r\nthe action of fire on the rocks and stones; though whether remote\r\nor recent, it is not easy to determine. The connection between the\r\ntwo principal divisions of the work is also narrow, being barely two\r\nhundred and fifty feet in width.\r\n\r\nSuch are the more striking features of this interesting work.\r\nConsidered in a military point of view, as a work of defence, it is\r\nwell chosen, well guarded, and, with an adequate force, impregnable\r\nto any mode of attack practised by a rude, or semi-civilized people.\r\nAs a natural stronghold, it has few equals; and the [p016] degree\r\nof skill displayed and the amount of labor expended in constructing\r\nits artificial defences, challenge our admiration, and excite our\r\nsurprise. With all the facilities and numerous mechanical appliances\r\nof the present day, the construction of a work of this magnitude\r\nwould be no insignificant undertaking. And when we reflect how\r\ncomparatively rude, at the best, must have been the means at the\r\ncommand of the people who raised this monument, we are prepared to\r\nestimate the value which they placed upon the objects sought in its\r\nerection, and also to form some conclusion respecting the number and\r\ncharacter of the people themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary to recapitulate the features which give to\r\nthis the character of a military work; for they are too obvious to\r\nescape attention. The angles of the hill form natural bastions,\r\nenfilading the wall. The position of the wall, the structure of the\r\nditch, the peculiarities of the gateways where ascent is practicable,\r\nthe greater height of the wall where the declivity of the hill is\r\nleast abrupt, the reservoirs of water, the look-out or citadel, all\r\ngo to sustain the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of antiquity afforded by the aspect of the forest, is\r\nworthy of more than a passing notice. Actual examination showed the\r\nexistence of not far from «two hundred» annual rings or layers to the\r\nfoot, in the large chestnut-tree already mentioned, now standing upon\r\nthe entrenchments. This would give nearly «six hundred years» as the\r\nage of the tree. If to this we add the probable period intervening\r\nfrom the time of the building of the work to its abandonment, and\r\nthe subsequent period up to its invasion by the forest, we are led\r\nirresistibly to the conclusion, that it has an antiquity of at least\r\n«one thousand years».[13] But when we notice, all around us, the\r\ncrumbling trunks of trees half hidden in the accumulating soil, we\r\nare induced to fix upon an antiquity still more remote.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note, that this work is in a broken country, with no\r\nother remains, except perhaps a few small, scattered mounds, in its\r\nvicinity. The nearest monuments of magnitude are in the Paint creek\r\nvalley, sixteen miles distant, from which it is separated by elevated\r\nridges. Lower down, on Brush creek, towards its junction with the\r\nOhio, are some works; but none of importance occur within twelve\r\nmiles in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI. Fortified Hill, Butler Co. Ohio, 3 Mile S. W. of\r\nthe town of Hamilton.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VI.\r\n FORTIFIED HILL, BUTLER COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis fine work is situated in Butler county, Ohio, on the west side\r\nof the Great Miami river, three miles below the town of Hamilton.\r\nThe plan is from a [p017] survey by JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq., and the\r\ndescription is made up from his notes. The hill, the summit of which\r\nit occupies, is about a half mile distant from the present bed of\r\nthe river, and is not far from two hundred and fifty feet high,\r\nbeing considerably more elevated than any other in the vicinity. It\r\nis surrounded at all points, except a narrow space at the north, by\r\ndeep ravines, presenting steep and almost inaccessible declivities.\r\nThe descent towards the north is gradual; and from that direction,\r\nthe hill is easy of access. It is covered with a primitive forest of\r\noak, hickory, and locust, of the same character with the surrounding\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nSkirting the brow of the hill, and generally conforming to its\r\noutline, is a wall of mingled earth and stone, having an average\r\nheight of five feet by thirty-five feet base. It has no accompanying\r\nditch; the earth composing it, which is a stiff clay, having been for\r\nthe most part taken up from the surface, without leaving any marked\r\nexcavation. There are a number of “dug holes,” however, at various\r\npoints, from which it is evident a portion of the material was\r\nobtained. The wall is interrupted by four gateways or passages, each\r\ntwenty feet wide; one opening to the north, on the approach above\r\nmentioned, and the others occurring where the spurs of the hill are\r\ncut off by the parapet, and where the declivity is least abrupt. They\r\nare all, with one exception, protected by inner lines of embankment,\r\nof a most singular and intricate description. These are accurately\r\ndelineated in the plan, which will best explain their character. It\r\nwill be observed that the northern gateway, in addition to its inner\r\nmaze of walls, has an exterior work of a crescent shape, the ends of\r\nwhich approach to within a few feet of the brow of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe excavations are uniformly near the gateways, or within the lines\r\ncovering them. None of them are more than sixty feet over, nor\r\nhave they any considerable depth. Nevertheless, they all, with the\r\nexception of the one nearest to gateway S, contain water for the\r\ngreater portion, if not the whole of the year. A pole may be thrust\r\neight or ten feet into the soft mud, at the bottom of those at E.\r\n\r\nAt S and W, terminating the parapet, are two mounds, each eight feet\r\nhigh, composed of stones thrown loosely together. Thirty rods distant\r\nfrom gateway N, and exterior to the work, is a mound ten feet high,\r\non which trees of the largest size are growing. It was partially\r\nexcavated a number of years ago, and a quantity of stones taken out,\r\nall of which seemed to have undergone the action of fire.\r\n\r\nThe ground in the interior of this work gradually rises, as indicated\r\nin the section, to the height of twenty-six feet above the base of\r\nthe wall, and overlooks the entire adjacent country.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of this work, are a number of others occupying the\r\nvalley; no less than six of large size occur within a distance of six\r\nmiles down the river. [See Plate III. No. 2. This work is marked A on\r\nthe map.]\r\n\r\nThe character of this structure is too obvious to admit of doubt.\r\nThe position which it occupies is naturally strong, and no mean\r\ndegree of skill is employed in its artificial defences. Every avenue\r\nis strongly guarded. The principal approach, the only point easy\r\nof access, or capable of successful assault, is rendered doubly\r\nsecure. A mound, used perhaps as an alarm post, is placed at about\r\none-fourth of the distance down the ascent; a crescent wall crosses\r\nthe isthmus, leaving but [p018] narrow passages between its ends\r\nand the steeps on either hand. Next comes the principal wall of the\r\nenclosure. In event of an attack, even though both these defences\r\nwere carried, there still remains a series of walls so complicated\r\nas inevitably to distract and bewilder the assailants, thus giving\r\na marked advantage to the defenders. This advantage may have been\r\nmuch greater than we, in our ignorance of the military system of this\r\nancient people, can understand. But, from the manifest judgment with\r\nwhich their defensive positions were chosen, as well as from the\r\ncharacter of their entrenchments, so far as we comprehend them, it is\r\nsafe to conclude that all parts of this work were the best calculated\r\nto secure the objects proposed by the builders, under the modes of\r\nattack and defence then practised.\r\n\r\nThe coincidences between the guarded entrances of this and similar\r\nworks throughout the West, and those of the Mexican defences, is\r\nsingularly striking. The wall on the eastern side of the Tlascalan\r\nterritories, mentioned by Cortez and Bernal Diaz, was six miles long,\r\nhaving a single entrance thirty feet wide, which was formed in the\r\nmanner represented in the supplementary plan A. The ends of the wall\r\noverlapped each other, in the form of semicircles, having a common\r\ncentre.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VII.\r\n “FORT ANCIENT,” WARREN COUNTY, OHIO.[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII. Fort Ancient, East Bank of the Little Miami\r\nRiver, 33 miles above Cincinnati.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive, if not the most extensive, work of this\r\nclass, in the entire West, occurs on the banks of the Little Miami\r\nriver, about thirty-five miles north-east from Cincinnati, in Warren\r\ncounty, Ohio. It has not far from four miles of embankment, for the\r\nmost part very heavy, rising, at the more accessible points, to the\r\nheight of eighteen and twenty feet. The accompanying map is from a\r\nfaithful survey, made by Prof. LOCKE, of Cincinnati, and published by\r\nhim amongst the papers of the American Association of Geologists and\r\nNaturalists, in [p019] 1843. One or two slight additions have been\r\nmade to his map, to indicate features which may be of some importance\r\nin a consideration of the work and its character. The description of\r\nProf. Locke, accompanying the map, though brief, and written with\r\na view to certain geological questions, may not be omitted in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n“This work occupies a terrace on the left bank of the river, and two\r\nhundred and thirty feet above its waters. The place is naturally\r\na strong one, being a peninsula, defended by two ravines, which,\r\noriginating on the east side near to each other, diverging and\r\nsweeping around, enter the Miami, the one above, the other below\r\nthe work. The Miami itself, with its precipitous bank of two\r\nhundred feet, defends the western side. The ravines are occupied by\r\nsmall streams. Quite around this peninsula, on the very verge of\r\nthe ravines, has been raised an embankment of unusual height and\r\nperfection. Meandering around the spurs, and re-entering to pass\r\nthe heads of the gullies, it is so winding in its course that it\r\nrequired one hundred and ninety-six stations to complete its survey.\r\nThe whole circuit of the work is between four and five miles. The\r\nnumber of cubic yards of excavation may be approximately estimated at\r\nsix hundred and twenty-eight thousand eight hundred. The embankment\r\nstands in many places twenty feet in perpendicular height; and\r\nalthough composed of a tough, diluvial clay, without stone, except in\r\na few places, its outward slope is from thirty-five to forty-three\r\ndegrees. This work presents no continuous ditch; but the earth for\r\nits construction has been dug from convenient pits, which are still\r\nquite deep, or filled with mud and water. Although I brought over a\r\nparty of a dozen active young engineers, and we had encamped upon the\r\nground to expedite our labors, we were still two days in completing\r\nour survey, which, with good instruments, was conducted with all\r\npossible accuracy. The work approaches nowhere within many feet of\r\nthe river; but its embankment is, in several places, carried down\r\ninto ravines from fifty to one hundred feet deep, and at an angle\r\nof thirty degrees, crossing a streamlet at the bottom, which, by\r\nshowers, must often swell to a powerful torrent. But in all instances\r\nthe embankment may be traced to within three to eight feet of the\r\nstream. Hence it appears, that although these little streams have cut\r\ntheir channels through fifty to one hundred feet of thin, horizontal\r\nlayers of blue limestone, interstratified with indurated clay marl,\r\nnot more than three feet of that excavation has been done since\r\nthe construction of the earthworks. If the first portion of the\r\ndenudation was not more rapid than the last, a period of at least\r\nthirty to fifty thousand years would be required for the present\r\npoint of its progress. But the quantity of material removed from\r\nsuch a ravine is as the square of its depth, which would render the\r\nlast part of its denudation much slower, in vertical descent, than\r\nthe first part. That our streams have not yet reached their ultimate\r\nlevel, a point beyond which they cease to act upon their beds, is\r\nevident from the vast quantity of solid material transported annually\r\nby our rivers, to be added to the great delta of the Mississippi.\r\nFinally, I am astonished to see a work, simply of earth, after\r\nbraving the storms of thousands of years, still so entire and well\r\nmarked. Several circumstances have contributed to this. The clay of\r\nwhich it is built is not easily penetrated by water. The bank has\r\nbeen, and is still, mostly covered by a forest [p020] of beech trees,\r\nwhich have woven a strong web of their roots over its steep sides;\r\nand a fine bed of moss («Polytrichum») serves still further to afford\r\nprotection.”\r\n\r\nUpon the steep slope of the hill, at the point where it approaches\r\nnearest to the river, are distinctly traceable three parallel\r\nterraces, which were not represented in the original map, but which\r\nare indicated here. It is not impossible that they are natural, and\r\nwere formed by successive «slips» or slides of earth, a feature not\r\nuncommon at the West. They nevertheless, from their great regularity,\r\nappear to be artificial, and are so regarded by most persons. A very\r\nfine view of the valley, in both directions, is commanded from them;\r\nthough, perhaps, no better than may be obtained from the brow of the\r\nhill along which the embankment runs. It has been suggested that they\r\nwere designed as stations, from which to annoy an enemy passing in\r\nboats or canoes along the river. This feature is illustrated in the\r\nsection «r s».\r\n\r\nFrom a point near the two large mounds on the neck of the peninsula,\r\nstart off two parallel walls, which continue for about thirteen\r\nhundred and fifty feet, when they diverge suddenly, but soon close\r\naround a small mound. As this outwork is in cultivated grounds, it\r\nhas been so much obliterated as to escape ordinary observation,\r\nand is now traceable with difficulty. These parallels are shown in\r\nthe Supplementary Plan A. They are almost identical, in all their\r\ndimensions, with similar parallels attached to ancient works in the\r\nScioto valley.\r\n\r\nIt is a feature no less worthy of remark in this than in other works\r\nof the same class, and one which bears directly upon the question of\r\ntheir design, that at all the more accessible points, the defences\r\nare of the greatest solidity and strength. Across the isthmus\r\nconnecting this singular peninsula with the table land, the wall is\r\nnearly double the height that it possesses at those points where the\r\nconformation of the ground assisted the builders in securing their\r\nposition. The average height of the embankment is between nine and\r\nten feet; but, at the place mentioned, it is no less than «twenty».\r\nAt the spur where the State road ascends the hill, and where the\r\ndeclivity is most gentle, the embankment is also increased in height\r\nand solidity, being at this time not less than fourteen feet high by\r\nsixty feet base.\r\n\r\nThere are over seventy gateways or interruptions in the embankment,\r\nat irregular intervals along its line. For reasons heretofore given,\r\nit is difficult to believe they were all designed as places of\r\ningress or egress. We can only account for their number, upon the\r\nhypothesis that they are places once occupied by block-houses or\r\nbastions composed of timber, and which have long since decayed. These\r\nopenings appear to have been originally about ten or fifteen feet in\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNos. 1–2. Butler Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Miami Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Montgomery Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThis work, it will be seen, consists of two grand divisions, the\r\npassage between which is long and narrow. Across this neck is carried\r\na wall of the ordinary dimensions, as if to prevent the further\r\nprogress of an enemy, in the event of either of the principal\r\ndivisions being carried,—a feature which, while it goes to establish\r\nthe military origin of the work, at the same time evinces the skill\r\nand foresight of the builders. This foresight is further shown,\r\nin so managing the excavations necessary for the erection of the\r\nwalls, as to form numerous large reservoirs; sufficient, in [p021]\r\nconnection with the springs originating within the work, to supply\r\nwith water any population which might here make a final stand before\r\nan invader. Even in the absence of these sources, surrounded as the\r\nwork is on every hand by streams, it would be easy, in face of the\r\nmost formidable investment, to procure an adequate supply.\r\n\r\nAt numerous points in the line of embankment, and where from\r\nposition they would yield the most effective support, are found\r\nlarge quantities of stones. These are water-worn, and seem, for the\r\nmost part, to have been taken from the river. If so, an incredible\r\namount of labor has been expended in transporting them to the places\r\nwhich they now occupy,—especially will it appear incredible, when we\r\nreflect that all of them were doubtless transported by human hands.\r\n\r\nA review of this magnificent monument cannot fail to impress us\r\nwith admiration of the skill which selected, and the industry\r\nwhich secured this position. Under a military system, such as we\r\nfeel warranted in ascribing to the people by whom this work was\r\nconstructed, it must have been impregnable. In every point of view,\r\nit is certainly one of the most interesting remains of antiquity\r\nwhich the continent affords.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VIII. No. 1.\r\n [From the Surveys and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis work occurs on the bank of the Great Miami river, four miles\r\nabove the town of Hamilton, in Butler county, Ohio, and is one\r\nof the most interesting hill-works known. It corresponds in all\r\nessential particulars with those of the same class already described.\r\nIt occupies the summit of a promontory cut from the table lands\r\nbordering the Miami river, which upon three sides presents high and\r\nsteep natural banks, rendered more secure for purposes of defence by\r\nartificial embankments thrown up along their brows. The remaining\r\nside is defended by a wall and ditch, and it is from this side only\r\nthat the work is easy of approach. The walls are low, measuring\r\nat this time but about four feet in height. The area enclosed is\r\nlevel, subsiding somewhat towards the north, so as to form a sort\r\nof natural terrace along the river. Previous to the construction of\r\nthe Miami canal, this terrace was eight or ten rods wide, having a\r\nperpendicular bank next the river, some fifty or more feet high. Upon\r\nthis terrace are situated several small mounds. The point indicated\r\nby «c» in the plan is the most elevated within the enclosure.\r\nThe ground here was intermixed with large stones, most of which\r\nwere removed in building the canal. Among them, it is said, were\r\nfound several human skeletons, and also a variety of carved stone\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature in connection with this work is the\r\nentrance on the south, of which the enlarged plan can alone afford\r\na fair conception. The ends [p022] of the wall curve inwardly\r\nas they approach each other, upon a radius of seventy-five feet,\r\nforming a true circle, interrupted only by the gateways. Within the\r\nspace thus formed, is a small circle one hundred feet in diameter;\r\noutside of which and covering the gateway is a mound, «e», forty\r\nfeet in diameter and five feet high. The passage between the mound\r\nand the embankment, and between the walls of the circles, is now\r\nabout six feet wide. The gateway or opening «d» is twenty feet wide.\r\nThis singular entrance, it will be remarked, strongly resembles\r\nthe gateways belonging to a work already described («Plate VI.»),\r\nalthough much more regular in its construction.\r\n\r\nThe ditches, «f f», which accompany the wall on the south, subside\r\ninto the ravines upon either side. These ravines are not far from\r\nsixty feet deep, and have precipitous sides, rendering ascent almost\r\nimpossible. The mound «h» is three feet high.\r\n\r\nThe area of the work is seventeen acres; the whole of which is yet\r\ncovered with a dense primitive forest. The valley beyond the river\r\nis broad, and in it are many traces of a remote population, of which\r\nthis work was probably the fortress or place of last resort, during\r\nturbulent periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VIII. No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis work is situated six miles south-west of the town of Hamilton,\r\nin Butler county, Ohio. It has no very remarkable features, although\r\npossessing the general characteristics of this class of works. It\r\nconsists of a simple embankment of earth carried around the brow\r\nof a high, detached hill, overlooking a wide and beautiful section\r\nof the Miami valley. The side of the hill on the north, towards\r\nthe river, is very abrupt, and rises to the height of one hundred\r\nand twenty feet above the valley. The remaining sides are steep,\r\nthough comparatively easy of ascent. The walls are scarcely four\r\nfeet high, and seem to have been much reduced by time. There are six\r\ngateways, two of which open upon natural bastions or look-outs, and\r\nthe remaining four towards copious springs, as shown in the plan. The\r\nground within the walls rises gradually to the centre, from which an\r\nextended view of the valley and surrounding country may be obtained.\r\nThere are two mounds of earth placed near together on the highest\r\npoint within the enclosure, measuring respectively ten feet in height.\r\n\r\nSouth-east of the work, and nine hundred feet distant, is an eminence\r\nA, about fifty feet higher than the one occupied by the above\r\nmentioned work,—being much the highest point in the neighborhood. The\r\narea on the top is, however, inconsiderable. There are some traces of\r\nancient occupation here, though they are far from being distinct or\r\nconsiderable. [p023]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VIII. No. 3.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure here represented is situated on the left bank of the\r\nGreat Miami river, two and a half miles above the town of Piqua,\r\nMiami county, Ohio, upon the farm of Col. John Johnston, a prominent\r\nactor in the early history of Ohio. It occupies the third terrace,\r\nwhich here forms a bluff peninsula, bounded on three sides by\r\nstreams. The banks of the terrace vary from fifty to seventy-five\r\nfeet in height. The embankment is carried along the boundaries of the\r\npeninsula, enclosing an oval-shaped area of about eighteen acres.\r\nIt is composed of earth intermixed with large quantities of stone,\r\nand is unaccompanied by a ditch. The stones that enter into the\r\ncomposition of the rampart are water-worn, and must have been brought\r\nfrom the bed of the river; which, according to Dr. Drake, for two\r\nmiles opposite this work, does not at present afford a stone of ten\r\npounds weight. A mound, five feet high and surrounded by a ditch,\r\noccurs within the work. There is also another, exterior to the walls,\r\nupon the second terrace, towards the river. This is classed as a\r\ndefensive work, for very obvious reasons.[16]\r\n\r\nBelow this entrenchment, and on the present site of the town of\r\nPiqua, a group of works formerly existed, consisting of circles,\r\nellipses, etc. These have been described at length, by Major\r\nLong.[17] There are also various small works on the opposite bank of\r\nthe Miami. Indeed, the whole valley is here covered with traces of a\r\nformer dense population.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE VIII. No. 4.[18]\r\n\r\nThis work resembles one already described, No. 2 of this Plate. It\r\nis situated on the bank of the Great Miami river, three miles below\r\nDayton, Montgomery county, Ohio. The side of the hill towards the\r\nriver is very steep, rising to the [p024] height of one hundred and\r\nsixty feet. The remaining sides are less abrupt. Upon the south is\r\nthe principal gateway, and here the declivity is gentle. This gateway\r\nis covered upon the interior by a ditch, «c c», twenty feet wide, and\r\nseven hundred feet long. At «d d d» are dug holes, from which it is\r\napparent a portion of the earth composing the embankments was taken.\r\nAt «b» is a natural depression forty feet deep, and covering not far\r\nfrom one and a half acres. At the northern slope of the narrow ridge\r\nwhich intersects the work, and within the line of the embankment of\r\nwhich it forms a part, is a small mound. From its top a full view\r\nof the surrounding country, for a long distance up and down the\r\nriver, may be obtained. A terrace, apparently artificial, skirts the\r\nnorth-west side of the hill, thirty feet below the embankment. As\r\nremarked in a former instance, this terrace may be natural; it has,\r\nhowever, all the regularity of a work of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE IX. No. 1.\r\n FORTIFIED HILL, NEAR GRANVILLE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe work here represented is situated two miles below the town of\r\nGranville, Licking county, Ohio. It encloses the summit of a high\r\nhill, and embraces an area of not far from eighteen acres. The\r\nembankment is, for the most part, carried around the hill at a\r\nconsiderable distance below its brow, and is completely overlooked\r\nfrom every portion of the enclosed area. Unlike all other hill-works\r\nwhich have fallen under notice, the ditch occurs «outside» of the\r\nwall; the earth in the construction of the latter having been thrown\r\nupwards and inwards. This is observed equally at the points where\r\nthe hill is steepest; and the result has been, in the lapse of time,\r\nthat the ditch is almost obliterated, while the accumulating earth\r\nhas filled the space above the wall, so that the appearance of the\r\ndefence, at these points, is that of a high, steep terrace. The\r\nheight of the wall varies at different places; where the declivity\r\nis gentle and the approach easy, it is highest,—perhaps eight or\r\nten feet from the bottom of the ditch; elsewhere it is considerably\r\nless. The embankment conforms generally to the shape of the hill. It\r\nis interrupted by three gateways, two of which open towards springs\r\nof water, and the other, or principal one, upon a long narrow spur,\r\nwhich subsides gradually into the valley of Raccoon creek, affording\r\na comparatively easy ascent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Fortified Hill, Near Granville, Licking Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Fortified Hill, Near the mouth of the Great Miami River,\r\nHamilton Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Ancient Work, near Lexington, Kentucky.]\r\n\r\nUpon the highest part of the ground enclosed in this work, is a small\r\ncircle, one hundred feet in diameter, within which are two small\r\nmounds. There is also another truncated mound, a little distance\r\nto the northward of the circle. The mounds within the circle, upon\r\nexcavation, were found, in common with all similar structures\r\noccurring within enclosures, to contain «altars». No enduring remains\r\nseem to have been deposited upon these altars, which were covered\r\nwith ashes, intermixed with small fragments of pottery. This is\r\nthe only hill-work which has [p025] been observed to embrace a\r\nminor work of the description here represented. The character of\r\nthe principal enclosure can hardly be mistaken; it is palpably a\r\ndefensive work, although deficient in that grand essential, a supply\r\nof water. If we concede, what can hardly admit of doubt, that the\r\nminor structure had a sacred or superstitious origin, we must of\r\nnecessity arrive at the conclusion that the altars of the ancient\r\npeople sometimes accompanied their defences.\r\n\r\nThis work constitutes one of the Newark Group, and is indicated\r\nby the letter B in the “«Map of six miles of the Newark Valley»,”\r\npresented upon a succeeding plate. This section of country was once\r\ndensely populated, as is evidenced by the number and extent of the\r\nancient remains which it includes; and it is probable that the work\r\nhere noticed, together with one of like character upon the opposite\r\nside of the valley, three miles distant, constituted the places of\r\nlast resort of the ancient inhabitants. The extensive works in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Newark, of which a full account is elsewhere\r\ngiven, can hardly be supposed to partake of a military character.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE IX. No. 2.[19]\r\n FORTIFIED HILL AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT MIAMI RIVER,\r\n HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis work is strictly analogous to the other hill-works already\r\ndescribed, and is so well exhibited in the engraving as to need\r\nlittle explanation. It occupies the summit of a steep, insulated\r\nhill, and consists of a wall carried along its brow, composed of\r\nearth, thrown as usual in such cases from the interior. The wall\r\nconforms strictly to the outline of the hill, except at the west,\r\nwhere there is a considerable promontory, which is left unenclosed.\r\nUpon this promontory is a mound, corresponding doubtless in its\r\npurposes with the one on the principal avenue of approach to the\r\nremarkable fortified hill, higher up on the Miami, in Butler\r\ncounty (Plate VI.) The late President Harrison regarded this work\r\nas admirably designed for defence, and as evincing extraordinary\r\nmilitary skill. He says:\r\n\r\n“The work at the mouth of the Great Miami was a citadel, more\r\nelevated than the Acropolis of Athens, although easier of access, as\r\nit is not like the latter a solid rock, but upon three sides is as\r\nnearly perpendicular as could be, to be composed of earth. A large\r\nspace of the low ground was, however, enclosed by walls uniting it\r\nwith the Ohio. The foundation of that (being of stone as well as\r\nthose of the citadel) which formed the western defence, is still\r\nvisible where it crosses [p026] the Miami river, which, at the\r\nperiod of the erection of the work, must have discharged itself into\r\nthe Ohio at a point much lower down than it now does. I have never\r\nbeen able to discover the eastern wall of the enclosure; but if its\r\ndirection from the citadel to the Ohio was such as it should have\r\nbeen, to embrace the largest space with the least labor, there could\r\nnot have been less than three hundred acres enclosed.”[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE IX. No. 3.\r\n ANCIENT WORK NEAR LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.\r\n [From the RAFINESQUE MSS.]\r\n\r\nThis work is situated at the junction of the Town and South forks of\r\nthe Elkhorn river, seven miles from the town of Lexington, Kentucky.\r\nIts character is sufficiently explained by the engraving. It is\r\nentirely singular in having a stream, of considerable size, running\r\nthrough it. The river has probably encroached upon its original\r\nproportions. About one hundred yards to the eastward of this work is\r\na small, oblong enclosure, and a large, elliptical, truncated mound.\r\nOther mounds and enclosures occur in the vicinity.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE X.\r\n CLARK’S WORK; NORTH FORK OF PAINT CREEK.[22]\r\n\r\nThe work here presented is one of the largest and most interesting\r\nin the Scioto valley. It has many of the characteristics of a\r\nwork of defence, and is accordingly classified as such, although\r\ndiffering in position and some other respects from the entrenched\r\nhills just described. The minor works which it encloses, or which\r\nare in combination with it, are manifestly of a different character,\r\nprobably religious [p027] in their design, and would seem to point\r\nto the conclusion, that this was a fortified town, rather than a\r\ndefensive work of last resort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X. North Fork, Works, Ross Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nIt is situated on the North fork of Paint creek, on the estate of W.\r\nC. CLARK, Esq. and occupies the entire width of the second terrace,\r\nwhich here presents a broad and level plain, of exceeding beauty and\r\nfertility. Its general form is that of a parallelogram, twenty-eight\r\nhundred feet by eighteen hundred, with one of its corners somewhat\r\nrounded. On the side next the creek, it is bounded by a wall four\r\nfeet high, running along the very edge of the terrace-bank, and\r\nconforming to its irregularities; these however are slight. Its\r\nremaining sides are bounded by a wall and exterior ditch; the\r\nwall is six feet high by thirty-five feet base, and the ditch of\r\ncorresponding dimensions. The lines ascend the declivity of the table\r\nland back of the terrace, and extend along its brow, dipping into the\r\nravines and rising over the ridges into which it has been cut by the\r\naction of water. Wherever the ravines are of any considerable depth,\r\nthe wall has been washed away; but in all cases leaving evidences\r\nthat it once extended uninterruptedly through. The bank of the\r\nterrace is thirty, that of the table-land fifty feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe area thus enclosed is one hundred and eleven acres. To the right\r\nof the principal work, and connecting with it by a gateway at its\r\ncentre, is a smaller work of «sixteen acres area». It is a «perfect\r\nsquare»; its sides measuring respectively eight hundred and fifty\r\nfeet. It has gateways at the middle of each side, thirty feet wide,\r\nand covered by small mounds, which are placed fifty feet interior to\r\nthe walls. There are gateways also at the two outer corners, which\r\nare unaccompanied by mounds. The opening which leads to the principal\r\nenclosure is twice as wide as the others. The walls of the smaller\r\nwork are much lighter than those of the large one, and have no\r\nattendant ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nWithin the area of the great work, are two small ones: one of them\r\nis a perfect circle, three hundred and fifty feet in diameter,\r\nbounded by a single slight wall, with a gateway opening to the\r\nwest; the other is a semi-circular enclosure, two thousand feet in\r\ncircumference, bounded by a slight circumvallation and ditch as\r\nrepresented in the plan. Within this last enclosure (of which Fig.\r\n3 is a view) are seven mounds; three of which are joined together,\r\nforming a continuous elevation thirty feet high by five hundred feet\r\nlong, and one hundred and eighty broad at the base. (See longitudinal\r\nsection «n o».) The ground within this work appears to be elevated\r\nabove the general level of the plain, whether designedly or by the\r\nwasting of the mounds it is impossible to say. There are other\r\nmounds at the points indicated in the plan, most of which have been\r\nexplored; with what results will appear in the chapter on mounds.\r\nIt may nevertheless be proper to remark, that nearly all the mounds\r\nexamined were places of sacrifice, containing altars; thus confirming\r\nthe opinion already confidently expressed, respecting the character\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nWhere the defences descend from the table lands to the left, is a\r\ngully or [p028] torrent-bed, which, before the construction of this\r\nwork, kept the course indicated by the dotted line «x». It was turned\r\nby the builders from its natural channel into the ditch, along which\r\nit still runs for a considerable distance; but at one place it has\r\nbroken over the wall, obliterating it for nearly two hundred feet. It\r\nis dry at most seasons of the year; and, unless much swollen by the\r\nrains, keeps the course of the ditch, terminating in a deep gully,\r\nformed by the flow of water from a copious and unfailing spring. This\r\ngully is made to answer as a ditch, for the space yet intervening,\r\nto the edge of the terrace. It is fifteen feet deep, by sixty or\r\nseventy wide. In several other instances, this artificial change in\r\nwater-courses has been observed.\r\n\r\nThe gateways of this work are six in number; one opening into the\r\nsmaller enclosure to the east, two upon the table lands, one to\r\nthe spring first mentioned, and two others towards the creek. Two\r\nconsiderable springs occur within the walls. It is not necessary,\r\nhowever, upon the hypothesis already advanced in respect to this\r\nwork, to suppose its ancient population wholly dependent upon these\r\nsources for their supply of water; inasmuch as it is very evident\r\nthat many centuries have not elapsed since the creek, now one hundred\r\nrods distant, washed the base of the terrace upon which it stands.\r\nIndeed, until recently, and until prevented by dykes above, the creek\r\nat its highest stages continued to send a portion of its waters along\r\nits ancient channel.\r\n\r\nThe slight wall along the terrace bank is composed chiefly of smooth,\r\nwater-worn stones, taken from the creek, and cemented together by\r\ntough, clayey earth. The wall of the square is wholly of clay, and\r\nits outlines may be easily traced by the eye, from a distance, by\r\nits color. It appears, as do the embankments of many other works, to\r\nhave been slightly burned. This appearance is so marked, as to induce\r\nsome persons to suppose that the walls were, in certain instances,\r\noriginally composed of bricks partially baked, but which have in\r\nprocess of time lost their form, and subsided into a homogeneous\r\nmass. That they have in some cases been subjected to the action of\r\nfire, is too obvious to admit of doubt. At the point «z» in the lower\r\nwall of the square, stones and large masses of pebbles and earth,\r\nmuch burned, and resembling a ferruginous conglomerate, are turned\r\nup by the plough. May not this feature be accounted for by supposing\r\nthe walls to have been originally surmounted by palisades, which were\r\ndestroyed by the action of fire? Such a cause, however, seems hardly\r\nadequate to produce so striking results.\r\n\r\nThe broken table land upon which the main work extends, forms natural\r\nbastions at «T» and «S», which have gateways opening to them. At the\r\npoint marked «C» in the embankment, a quantity of calcined human\r\nbones are observable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI. Ancient Work, Butler Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the features of this interesting work; and if their\r\ndetail has been tedious, it may be urged in extenuation of such\r\nminuteness, that descriptions have hitherto been quite too vague and\r\ngeneral. Minute circumstances are often of the first importance in\r\narriving at correct conclusions. The comparative slightness of the\r\nwall and the absence of a ditch, at the points possessing natural\r\ndefences,—the extension of the artificial defences upon the table\r\nlands overlooking and commanding the terrace,—the facilities afforded\r\nfor an abundant supply of water, as well as the large area enclosed,\r\nwith its mysterious circles and sacred [p029] mounds,—«all» go to\r\nsustain the conclusion, that this was a fortified town or city of the\r\nancient people. The history of its fall, if its strange monuments\r\ncould speak, would perhaps tell of heroic defence of homes and\r\naltars, and of daring achievements in siege and assault.\r\n\r\nThe amount of labor expended in the construction of this work, in\r\nview of the imperfect means at the command of the builders, is\r\nimmense. The embankments measure together nearly «three miles» in\r\nlength; and a careful computation shows that, including mounds, not\r\nless than three millions cubic feet of earth were used in their\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nWithin this work, some of the most interesting discoveries recorded\r\nin this volume were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XI. No. 1.\r\n [From the Surveys and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis highly interesting work is situated in Butler county, Ohio,\r\non the banks of Seven Mile creek, five miles north of the town of\r\nHamilton. It is formed by two irregular lines of embankment, and an\r\nexterior ditch, cutting off a jutting point of the second terrace;\r\nand has an area of twenty-five acres. These embankments are parallel\r\nthroughout, and were evidently both made from the same ditch. The\r\nouter one has an average height of four, the inner one of three feet.\r\nThe ditch is between five and six feet deep, by thirty-five feet\r\nwide. At the southern portion of the work, both walls and the ditch\r\nhave their greatest dimensions. The side of the work next the stream\r\nis bounded by an abrupt natural bank, eighteen feet high. Distant a\r\nfew rods from the north-eastern angle of the work, is an elliptical\r\nmound eleven feet high; its conjugate and transverse diameters are\r\nninety-two and one hundred and eighteen feet respectively.\r\n\r\nThis work has a single gateway thirty feet wide. The inner wall,\r\nnear its southern extremity, curves inward along the terrace-bank\r\nfor a considerable distance. The first, or creek terrace, is a low\r\nalluvion, not subject to overflow. It is evident, however, that the\r\ncreek once ran at the base of the natural bank (now bounding one\r\nside of this work), probably at the period of its construction and\r\noccupancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XI. No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis work affords a very fair illustration of one portion of the\r\ndefensive structures of the West, already alluded to in the general\r\nremarks on the subject, at the [p030] beginning of this chapter.\r\nIt occurs in Oxford township, Butler county, Ohio (Lot 6, Sec. 31,\r\nTp. 5, Range 2, E. M.), at a point on Four Mile creek, where that\r\nstream forms a remarkable bend, constituting a peninsula one thousand\r\nand sixty feet across at its neck, and one thousand three hundred\r\nand twenty feet deep. This peninsula is, in fact, a bold head-land,\r\nwith precipitous banks, rising sixty feet above the water in the\r\ncreek, and overlooking the low bottoms that surround it. Across the\r\nneck of this peninsula is carried a crescent-shaped wall with an\r\nouter ditch. The wall is now but little over three feet in height,\r\nand the ditch of corresponding depth. Formerly it was much higher,\r\nprecluding cultivation. It has been reduced by the present occupant,\r\nwho has ploughed along it longitudinally, throwing the furrows into\r\nthe ditch,—a common practice, which is fast reducing and obliterating\r\nthese interesting monuments of antiquity. A single gateway twenty\r\nfeet wide leads into the enclosure, which has an area of twenty\r\nacres. A terrace, apparently artificial, and thirty feet wide, occurs\r\non the northern bank, at about midway from the water to the top.\r\nIt may be a natural feature, and caused by the subsidence of the\r\nbank from the undermining of the stream. The creek, at one time,\r\nunquestionably ran close under the banks of the peninsula; whether or\r\nnot the recession, leaving the intervening low bottom, B, took place\r\nsubsequently to the erection of the work, it is of course impossible\r\nto determine.\r\n\r\nIn this work will be remarked the lapping round of the parapet,\r\non the natural bank of the stream at «b»,—a feature heretofore\r\nmentioned, as probably designed to protect the flank of the defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XI. No. 3.\r\n\r\nAmong the works remarkable as possessing double walls, is the one\r\nhere presented. It is situated on the Great Miami river, four miles\r\nsouth-west of the town of Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio. The plan\r\nobviates the necessity of a detailed description. The outer line\r\nof defence consists of a simple embankment five feet high, with an\r\nexterior ditch four feet deep. It has a single gateway fifteen feet\r\nwide. There are apparent gateways at «a a», but the ditch only is\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nInterior to this line of embankment, is another of less dimensions,\r\nhaving also but one opening. At «b» is a large broad mound, over\r\nwhich, and somewhat below the summit on the outer side, the\r\ninner line of embankment is carried. The ditch also continues\r\nuninterruptedly over the mound, which is thirty feet high. From\r\nits summit, a view of the entire work and surrounding country\r\nis commanded. Another mound, ten feet high, occurs at the point\r\nindicated in the plan. It is composed of stone and gravel, apparently\r\ntaken from the river, and probably belongs to the class of mounds\r\ndenominated “sacrificial,”—the characteristics of [p031] which\r\nare explained in another chapter. At «c», the outer wall appears to\r\nhave formerly extended down to a lower level; but it has been much\r\nobliterated by the washing of the bank. The natural banks, on the\r\nside towards the river and next to Big Run, are inaccessibly steep,\r\nand between sixty and seventy feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XII. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Duck River, Franklin Co. Tennessee.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Preble Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Greene Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Ross Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThe area, embraced within the exterior lines, is a trifle less than\r\neighteen acres. The defensive character of this work can hardly be\r\ndoubted. It has been suggested that the large mound, over which the\r\ninner wall is carried, was designed as a look-out, or alarm post.\r\nThis may not have been its primary, but it is not impossible that\r\nsuch was its secondary purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XII. No. 1.\r\n STONE WORK, ON DUCK RIVER, TENNESSEE.[23]\r\n\r\nThis work is situated in Franklin county, Tennessee, at the junction\r\nof the east and west branches of Duck river, and near the main road\r\nfrom Nashville to Winchester.\r\n\r\n“It includes an area of about thirty-two acres. The walls are\r\ncomposed of stones of various sizes, collected from the surface of\r\nthe surrounding country, and rudely thrown together; there is no\r\nappearance of their having been united by cement, nor do they exhibit\r\nany marks of the hammer. The wall on the south is covered with a\r\nlayer of earth from one to two feet deep, and is about sixteen feet\r\nin thickness at the base, about five feet at the top, and from eight\r\nto ten feet high.\r\n\r\n“At the northern extremity, near the front wall, are two conical\r\nmounds of stone, designated by M, M, in the plan. Each of these\r\nmounds is about six feet high, and ten feet in diameter at the base;\r\noriginally they may have been of somewhat greater altitude, and being\r\non the exterior of the wall, may have been intended as watch towers.\r\nIn the rear of the mounds is the northern wall, extending to a high\r\nbank on either branch of Duck river, and opposite to a waterfall on\r\neach, of ten or twelve feet in height. In the northern wall is an\r\nentrance or gateway, and in the rear of the gateway are what appear\r\nto be the remains of two stone buildings [p032] (exaggerated in\r\nthe plan), one about sixteen feet square, the other about ten feet;\r\nthe stones are rough and unhewn. Stretching south, the walls are\r\ncontinued on both sides until they reach the points «a a», at a bold\r\nlimestone bluff, which forms a good natural defence. South of the\r\nbluff the walls are continued of the same height and thickness, until\r\nthey reach the angles of the wall fronting the south, which wall also\r\nextends from the bank of one river to the other, and has a gateway\r\nnearly opposite to that in the northern wall. At the points «a a», it\r\nis supposed by many who have examined this work, there were formerly\r\nexcavated passages leading to each branch of Duck river, with steps\r\ncut in the rock. There does not, however, appear to be sufficient\r\nevidence to sustain this conclusion. The ascent or descent is not\r\nvery difficult; the steps appear to be formed by the projection of\r\nthe rock strata; and it was no doubt by these passages that the\r\noccupants of the work gained access to the river, and were supplied\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n“Near the base of the wall on the south side is a ditch, from sixteen\r\nto twenty feet wide, and six or eight deep. A short distance farther\r\nfrom the southern wall is another and much more extensive ditch or\r\nexcavation. In some places it is seventy or eighty feet wide, and\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty feet deep. The earth from these ditches\r\nwas probably removed to cover the walls of the fort, or employed in\r\nthe erection of the neighboring mounds, while the ditches themselves\r\nconstituted an additional means of defence.\r\n\r\n“About three quarters of a mile north of this work is a mound of an\r\noblong form, about twenty-five feet high, one hundred feet long,\r\nand twenty broad. On the north-west, about half a mile distant, is\r\nanother mound of similar form, twenty feet high, eighty long, and\r\nsixty wide. These mounds are constructed with the same regularity\r\nthat distinguishes all the other works of similar character. On both\r\nthese mounds, trees are growing as large as any in the surrounding\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n“This work differs in its form, and in the material used in its\r\nconstruction, from all others in the vicinity; but it does not\r\nexhibit greater evidence of skill. The difference in form was\r\nprobably owing to its location; it having evidently been made to\r\nconform in all respects to the nature of the ground. Stones were\r\nemployed because they could be readily procured. Although the hammer\r\nhad nothing to do with the preparation of the materials, it was\r\nnevertheless a work of great labor, and the place of location was\r\nselected with a military eye.”\r\n\r\nNumerous other defensive works are represented to exist in Tennessee;\r\nbut very few of them have been surveyed and described. In Bedford\r\ncounty there is a stone work of considerable size, the walls of\r\nwhich are said to be from sixteen to twenty feet wide at the base,\r\nand four to five feet wide on the top. Other works adjoin it. It is\r\ngenerally believed to have been erected by De Soto; but in 1819 an\r\noak-tree standing on the wall was cut down, which exhibited three\r\nhundred and fifty-seven annual layers, and must consequently have\r\nbeen seventy-eight years old when De Soto landed in Florida.[24]\r\n\r\nA stone work, less in size, but of the same general character,\r\noccurs in Larue [p033] county, Kentucky. It is situated on one of\r\nthe bluffs of the Rolling Fork of Salt river, where the creek makes\r\na sharp bend. A plan of it is published in Collins’s History of\r\nKentucky, p. 398. An account of another, of much the same character,\r\nin Allen county, is published in the same work, p. 167.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XII. No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis work is situated at the junction of the two principal forks\r\nof Twin creek, an affluent of the Great Miami river, six miles\r\nsouth-east of the town of Eaton, Preble county, Ohio, on S. E. corner\r\nof Sec. No. 10, Township 5, of Range 3, E. M. The plan is from a\r\nsurvey by Mr. MCBRIDE.\r\n\r\nIn position and mode of construction, this work does not differ\r\nmaterially from a number of others already described. The embankment\r\nhas an average height of about four feet, and the ditch is not far\r\nfrom five feet deep. The bluff bordering upon the Franklin fork\r\nof the creek is for the most part precipitous, and has an average\r\nheight of between fifty and sixty feet. At its base are several\r\nnever-failing springs. The height of the bluff fronting upon the\r\nother fork varies from thirty feet near the end of the wall, to sixty\r\nfeet at the junction of the two streams. At its highest part, the\r\nbluff consists of a conglomerate, composed of gravel and stones of\r\nconsiderable size. It is very porous, and overhangs about ten feet.\r\nThere are a number of large cavities in it, which were once supposed\r\nto be artificial, and the entrances to subterranean chambers. They\r\nare formed by the disintegration of the materials composing the bluff.\r\n\r\nNearly in the centre of the work, in the position indicated in the\r\nplan, is a line of large stones. They occupy a space about seven\r\nhundred feet long, by twelve broad, and are laid compactly together.\r\nThough much sunk in the earth, they are yet distinctly traceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XII. No. 3.[25]\r\n\r\nThe fortification here presented affords a fine illustration of\r\nthe character of the ancient defences of the West. It is situated\r\non Massie’s creek, a tributary of the Little Miami river, seven\r\nmiles east from the town of Xenia, Greene county, [p034] Ohio; and\r\nconsists of a high promontory, bounded on all sides, excepting an\r\ninterval at the west, by a precipitous limestone cliff. Across the\r\nisthmus, from which the ground gradually subsides towards the plain\r\nalmost as regularly as an artificial glacis, is carried a wall of\r\nearth and stones. This wall is now about ten feet high by thirty\r\nfeet base, and is continued for some distance along the edge of the\r\ncliff where it is least precipitous, on the north. It is interrupted\r\nby three narrow gateways, exterior to each of which was formerly a\r\nmound of stones, now mostly carried away. Still exterior to these\r\nare four short crescent walls, extending across the isthmus. These\r\ncrescents are rather slight, not much exceeding, at the present time,\r\nthree feet in height. The cliff has an average height of upwards of\r\ntwenty-five feet, and is steep and almost inaccessible. At «d d» are\r\nbreaks in the limestone, where the declivity is sufficiently gentle\r\nto admit of a passage on horseback. At E is a fissure in the cliff,\r\nwhere persons may ascend on foot. The valley, or rather ravine, C C,\r\nis three hundred feet broad. Massie’s creek, a considerable stream,\r\nwashes the base of the promontory on the north. The area bounded by\r\nthe cliff and embankment is not far from twelve acres. The whole is\r\nnow covered with the primitive forest.\r\n\r\nThe natural strength of this position is great, and no inconsiderable\r\ndegree of skill has been expended in perfecting its defences. A\r\npalisade, if carried around the brow of the cliff and along the\r\nsummit of the wall, would render it impregnable to savage assault.\r\nAbout one hundred rods above this work, on the opposite side of the\r\ncreek, is a small circle, two hundred feet in diameter, enclosing a\r\nmound. About the same distance below, upon the same bank, is a large\r\nconical mound, thirty feet in height and one hundred and forty feet\r\nin diameter at the base. No other works of magnitude are known to\r\nexist, nearer than the great defensive structure on the Little Miami\r\n(Plate VII.), twenty-one miles distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XII. No. 4.\r\n\r\nThis work, unlike those just described, occurs upon the high\r\ntable-land bordering the Scioto river bottoms, on the west bank\r\nof that stream, twelve miles above the city of Chillicothe. It\r\nconsists of a single wall and ditch, cutting off a high promontory,\r\nformed by the declivity of the table land, and the bank of a wide\r\nand deep ravine. These banks are not far from one hundred feet in\r\nheight, and at most points are absolutely inaccessible. It has a\r\nsingle gateway, opening towards a copious spring, at the head of the\r\nravine just mentioned. The wall is four feet high, and the ditch of\r\ncorresponding depth. There are no mounds within this enclosure, nor\r\nin its immediate vicinity; but a number of natural elevations are\r\ndiscernible, which an unpractised eye might mistake for works of art.\r\nIn this instance, they may have subserved some of the purposes of the\r\nmounds. [p035] The water flowing through the ditch has formed deep\r\ngullies at the points where it terminates. The soil is here clayey\r\nand hard. The level at the foot of the promontory upon which this\r\nwork stands, is the first or latest-formed terrace of the Scioto;\r\nindicating that the river, at one period, swept along where the Ohio\r\ncanal now passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIII. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. In Bourbon Co. Kentucky.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Near Colerain, Butler Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XIII. No. 1.\r\n [From the RAFINESQUE MSS.]\r\n\r\nThis work, which seems incontestibly of a defensive character, is\r\nsituated on Stoner’s creek, at the mouth of Flat Run, in Bourbon\r\ncounty, Kentucky. The wall throughout is composed of earth, and is\r\nslight, not exceeding three or four feet in height. A number of\r\nmounds and excavations occur within the enclosure, together with\r\nother remains, consisting of raised outlines, two or three feet broad\r\nand one foot high. These are indicated by the letter «a», and are\r\ndenominated “remains of dwellings” by Rafinesque. Twenty of them are\r\nfound within, and fourteen without the walls; the latter occupying\r\nthe point of land to the north of the enclosure. The larger one is\r\ncalled “the palace” by our fanciful authority, and is represented\r\nto be eighty feet long by seventy-five broad. To the north of “the\r\npalace” is an elliptical, hollow area, fifteen feet deep; it is\r\nindicated by the letter «c». A number of irregular excavations are\r\nmarked by the letter «d». The Lexington road passes through this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XIII. No. 2.[26]\r\n [From the Surveys and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis work is one of the first magnitude; and in many respects bears\r\na close resemblance to the great work on the North fork of Paint\r\ncreek. (See Plate IX.) It is situated near the village of Coleraine,\r\nHamilton county, Ohio, on the right bank of the Great Miami river,\r\nand encloses an area of ninety-five acres. The walls have an average\r\nheight of nine feet, and have an exterior ditch of proportionate\r\ndimensions. The terrace upon which the work is located is thirty feet\r\nabove the usual stage of water in the river. [p036]\r\n\r\nThe outwork, of which A is an enlarged plan, possesses all the\r\nfeatures of a bastion, and was perhaps designed as such. It could\r\nhardly have been intended as a gateway; for, although the ditch is\r\ninterrupted for a narrow space at «c», the embankment is unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section of the wall, «a b», demonstrates the\r\nartificial origin of the work, which it is not probable any one would\r\nbe disposed to deny. The upheaved gravel upon the exterior side of\r\nthe wall, wherever it is under cultivation, supports dwarfed and\r\nsickly maize; while on the inner side, the grain is luxuriant. This\r\nfeature and its cause are indicated in the section.\r\n\r\nThis work, which was undoubtedly defensive, commands a large\r\npeninsula, two miles in circumference, formed by a singular bend\r\nin the river. About two hundred paces distant from this enclosure,\r\nin a southern direction, is the site of old Fort Dunlap, somewhat\r\ncelebrated in the early history of the Miami valley. It was invested\r\nby the notorious Simon Girty, with a force of six hundred Indians, in\r\n1791, without success. Some distance from the fort, and still further\r\nto the south, is a hill three hundred feet in altitude, upon the\r\ntop of which are two mounds, measuring five and ten feet in height,\r\nrespectively. They are composed of earth and stones, considerably\r\nburned.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1.—This work is situated near the north line of Pickaway\r\ncounty, Ohio, on the right bank of the Scioto river. It is entirely\r\nanalogous to many of those already described; and is only remarkable\r\nas possessing three lines of embankment, with corresponding ditches,\r\nas shown by the section «a b». “The ditches are here interior to\r\nthe walls, which circumstance is adverse to the idea of a defensive\r\norigin. The situation, however, with a steep bank and deep water on\r\none side, and deep ravines with precipitous banks on the others, is\r\none of great natural strength and adaptation for defence. The walls\r\nare now very slight.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2.—This work is, in most respects, similar to the one last\r\ndescribed. It is situated four and a half miles north of Worthington,\r\nFranklin county, Ohio, on the left bank of Olentangy creek. The\r\nartificial defences consist simply of an embankment of earth, three\r\nfeet in height, with an exterior ditch of corresponding depth. The\r\nnatural defences are sufficiently obvious. Both of these plans are\r\nfrom surveys by CHARLES WHITTLESEY, Esq.\r\n\r\nNUMBERS 3 AND 4.—The character of these works is sufficiently\r\nexplained by the engravings. From the position of the ditch and other\r\nobvious circumstances, they have been classed as of defensive origin.\r\nThey are from the Rafinesque MSS. [p037]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIV.

The\r\nindividual works are laid down from actual survey.\r\n\r\n“The enclosure A is principally in a field long cultivated, and is\r\nscarcely traceable. The ditch is exterior to the wall, and exists\r\nonly upon the north-west and south-west sides. The walls were very\r\nmuch reduced: when first seen by the whites, they scarcely exceeded\r\neighteen inches in height. The ditch was of corresponding depth.\r\n\r\n“The enclosure B occupies a promontory of gravelly land, elevated\r\nabout forty feet above the creek. The detached circular work D is\r\nnearly obliterated by the plough. It had a slight exterior ditch, as\r\nhad also a part of the main work B. The present height of the wall\r\nis from one to two and a half feet; depth of ditch somewhat less.\r\nThe breadth of the embankments, at the base, varies from fifteen\r\nto thirty feet. Within the enclosure B is an elevation of earth,\r\n«a», of a rectangular form, about three feet high, from which a low\r\nembankment extends to the outer wall. At «b» is a similar elevation\r\nconnected with the wall. Exterior to the work, and occupying the\r\npoint of the headland on which it stands, is a small mound, from\r\nwhich a skull was taken some years since, and deposited in the museum\r\nof the Willoughby University of Lake Erie. In it were also found the\r\ntwo valves of what is described as a «clam shell», each having three\r\nholes near the beak, suggesting the probability of a handle having\r\nbeen attached at that point, so as to constitute a spoon or ladle.\r\nBesides these were found two pipes of clay, and one of white marble,\r\npartly disintegrated, about two and a half inches high; also, a flat\r\npiece of a hard grayish slate, half an inch thick, wrought to an edge\r\nat the broad end, with a hole pierced obliquely through it, called\r\nby the finders ‘a hoe.’ A small earthen vessel, of coarse material\r\nand rude finish, holding about a pint, accompanied these relics.\r\nAll these articles were taken from the vicinity of coals and ashes,\r\nand burned human bones. In the hands of one of the skeletons were\r\npieces of clay, which had evidently been placed in them while in a\r\nplastic state, inasmuch as they still retained the impressions of the\r\nfingers, joints, and palms.[27] [p038]\r\n\r\n“The work C occupies a corresponding position with those already\r\ndescribed, as belonging to this group. The peninsula upon which it\r\nis situated is approachable only from the south. Upon this side the\r\nditch is irregular. The mounds of the central group have been opened;\r\nbut it is not known with what results. They are quite low, not\r\nexceeding three feet in height. The wall of this work is very slight.\r\nAt the south-west is a graded passage to the lower level of the river\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n“Huron river or creek, several branches of which join it at this\r\npoint, is always fordable; and the bluffs which surround the\r\nenclosures are not very difficult of ascent. These works may have\r\nbeen designed for defence,—perhaps they were ‘walled towns;’ but\r\nthey do not occupy positions of great natural strength. The grounds\r\nadjacent to the river are low, and in places swampy: the river\r\nevidently once ran at the base of the bluff occupied by the enclosure\r\nB.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2. «Ancient Work near Conneaut, Ashtabula county, Ohio.»—“This\r\nwork is at present very slight, but distinctly traceable. The sketch\r\nis a mere «coup d’œil», without measurements. The elevation of the\r\nbluff upon which it stands is about seventy feet; and the banks of\r\naluminous slate are, upon the north, very precipitous. It would be\r\nentirely impracticable for a body of men to ascend upon this side,\r\nwithout ladders and scaling apparatus. Upon the south side it would\r\nbe practicable for an assailant to ascend, unless prevented by some\r\nartificial obstacle. Upon this side, the wall which skirts the brow\r\nof the hill is accompanied by an outer ditch, while upon the north\r\nthere is a simple embankment. The ascent, C C, is gradual and easy.\r\nWithin the enclosure the earth is very black and rich; outside of the\r\nwalls it is a stiff clay. The adjacent bottoms are very fertile, and\r\nthe creek is everywhere fordable. There can be no doubt that this was\r\na fortified position.”\r\n\r\nNear the village of Conneaut are a number of mounds, and other traces\r\nof an ancient population, among which is an aboriginal cemetery\r\nregularly laid out, and of great extent.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3. «Ancient Work three miles south-east of Cleveland, Cuyahoga\r\ncounty, Ohio.»—“This stronghold is on the great plain which extends\r\nsome miles back from the shores of Lake Erie, gently declining\r\ntowards it, and by many supposed to have been its ancient bed. Many\r\nportions of this plain are two hundred feet above the present surface\r\nof the lake. The marl, sand, and gravel deposits, of which this\r\nformation is made up, are from one hundred to three hundred feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n“These materials are readily washed away by rains, springs, and\r\nrivulets; so that the flat region is intersected by numberless deep\r\nand narrow ravines, leaving bluff headlands, and furnishing the\r\nancient people with numerous positions protected on nearly every side\r\nby deep gullies and high precipitous banks, and capable, with little\r\nartificial aid, of easy defence. These features of the country, and\r\nthe manner in which they were made available for defensive purposes,\r\nare well illustrated in the example here presented. The isthmus\r\nconnecting this promontory with the general table is but about two\r\nhundred feet wide, and is defended by parallel lines [p039] of\r\nembankments accompanied by exterior ditches. There seems to be no\r\ngateway or opening through the outer line; the inner one, however,\r\nterminates before reaching the bank of the ravine on the left,\r\nleaving a narrow passage-way upon that side. The natural banks have\r\nan angle of forty-five to sixty degrees with the horizon, and are\r\nin many places wet and slippery, and utterly inaccessible. About\r\none-fourth of a mile to the eastward of this work, is a mound ten\r\nfeet high, by sixty feet in diameter at the base.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.—“This work is situated on the right bank of Black river, in\r\nSheffield township, Lorain county, Ohio. The bank of the river is\r\nhere nearly perpendicular and quite impossible of ascent, except by\r\nropes or something equivalent, and is about sixty feet high. The\r\nwater level of the lake reaches to this spot, and the river is in\r\nconsequence too deep to be forded. The position seems to have been\r\nselected for the purpose of defence, although the land back of it is\r\non the same level.\r\n\r\n“The artificial defences consist of double embankments, with an\r\nintermediate ditch. The embankments are very slight, not much\r\nexceeding a foot in height. It is not improbable that the ditch\r\nwas occupied by wooden pickets, supported by embankments on either\r\nside. The work could not have afforded any protection, except with\r\nadditional defences,—palisades, or something of the sort. Within the\r\nenclosure the soil is very rich; but without, it is clayey and poor.\r\nThe gateway, opening to the north, is forty feet wide.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.—“This work is situated in the same township with that last\r\ndescribed. It is bounded upon three sides by a vertical slate bluff,\r\nand defended upon the fourth by a double line of embankments, with\r\naccompanying exterior ditches. The height of the walls is about eight\r\nfeet, measuring from the bottom of the ditches. There is an opening\r\nor passage-way through the outer line, but none through the inner.\r\nWe may account for this circumstance by supposing the latter to have\r\nbeen thrown up after the commencement of a siege. As usual, the soil\r\nwithin this work is very rich compared with that without the walls.\r\nUnder any mode of attack known to barbarians, this must have been an\r\nimpregnable work. Upon the other side of the creek, are bluffs of\r\nequal height with that upon which this defence is located; but they\r\nare too far distant to afford positions of annoyance to besiegers.”\r\n[p040]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.—“This work is situated upon the Cuyahoga river, eight miles\r\nabove Cleveland, Ohio. It corresponds, in all essential particulars,\r\nwith the one on the same stream, five miles below, which has already\r\nbeen described. The ground has been so long under cultivation that\r\nthe parallels are with difficulty traced; they are not more than a\r\nfoot or eighteen inches high. The ditch is of corresponding depth.\r\nBetween the lines there is a depression,—undoubtedly artificial in\r\nits origin, but now much deepened by rains. The soil is a clay-loam,\r\nand the area very difficult of access from all sides. The bluff is\r\nhere from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet high.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 7.—“This work is situated on the Cuyahoga river, two miles\r\nbelow that last described, with which it coincides in respect to\r\nposition. It has, however, but a single wall and ditch; the latter\r\nis from two to four feet deep, the former of proportionate height.\r\nThere is a gateway or unexcavated passage across the ditch, but no\r\ncorresponding opening in the embankment. There is, however, a narrow,\r\nunprotected space between the left end of the defences and the bluff.\r\nThe elevation of the ground is here about two hundred feet above the\r\nriver, the soil sandy, and lately put under cultivation. The bluff\r\nis steep and difficult of ascent. Water is found in the adjacent\r\nravines, which are narrow and deep.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 8.—“This work is situated on the right bank of the Maumee river,\r\ntwo miles above Toledo, in Wood county, Ohio. The water of the\r\nriver is here deep and still, and of the lake level; the bluff is\r\nabout thirty-five feet high. Since the work was built, the current\r\nhas undermined a portion, and parts of the embankment are to be\r\nseen on the slips at «a a». The country for miles in all directions\r\nis flat and wet, though heavily timbered, as is the space in and\r\naround this enclosure. The walls, measuring from the bottoms of the\r\nditches, are from three to four feet high. They are not of uniform\r\ndimensions throughout their extent; and as there is no ditch on the\r\nsouth-west side, while there is a double wall and ditch elsewhere, it\r\nis presumable that the work was abandoned before it was finished.”\r\n[p041]\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be more plain, than that most of the remains in northern\r\nOhio, particularly those on the Cuyahoga river, are military works.\r\nThere have not yet been found any remnants of timber in the walls;\r\nyet it is very safe to presume that palisades were planted on them,\r\nand that wooden posts and gates were erected at the passages left in\r\nthe embankments and ditches.\r\n\r\n“All the positions are contiguous to water; and none of them have\r\nhigher land in their vicinity, from which they might in any degree\r\nbe commanded. Of the works bordering on the shore of Lake Erie,\r\nthrough the State of Ohio, there are none but may have been intended\r\nfor defence; although in some of them the design is not perfectly\r\nmanifest. They form a line from Conneaut to Toledo, at a distance\r\nof from three to five miles from the lake; and all stand upon or\r\nnear the principal rivers. There are probably five of them as yet\r\nunknown, to one that has been publicly noticed. In the interior of\r\nthe State, so far as my observation has extended, this class of\r\nworks is wanting. Their place is supplied by larger works, situated\r\non low lands, their strength depending more on artifice than on\r\nposition.[28] They are so different, that I am disposed to regard\r\nthem, not only as designed for other purposes, but as the work of\r\nanother and probably later people.\r\n\r\n“The most natural inference in respect to the northern cordon of\r\nworks is, that they formed a well-occupied line, constructed either\r\nto protect the advance of a nation landing from the lake and moving\r\nsouthward for conquest; or, a line of resistance for a people\r\ninhabiting these shores and pressed upon by their southern neighbors.\r\nThe scarcity of mounds, the absence of pyramids of earth, which are\r\nso common on the Ohio, the want of rectangular and other regular\r\nworks, at the north,—all these differences tend to the conclusion\r\nthat the northern part of Ohio was occupied by a distinct people.\r\n\r\n“At the north there is generally more than one wall of earth, and\r\nthe ditches are invariably exterior. There are sometimes passages,\r\nor ‘sally-ports,’ through the outer parallel, and none through the\r\ninner one. There is also, in general, a space between the parallels\r\nsufficiently large to contain a considerable body of fighting men.\r\nBy whatever people these works were built, they were much engaged\r\nin offensive or defensive wars. At the south, on the other hand,\r\nagriculture and religion seem to have chiefly occupied the attention\r\nof the ancient people.\r\n\r\n“In view of the above facts, we may venture to suggest a hypothesis,\r\nwithout undertaking to assign to it any more than a basis of\r\nprobability. Upon the assumption that two distinct nations occupied\r\nthe State,—that the northern were warlike, and the southern peaceful\r\nand agricultural in their habits,—may we not suppose that the latter\r\nwere overcome by their northern neighbors, who built the military\r\nworks to be observed upon the Ohio and its tributaries, while the\r\nmore regular structures are the remains of the conquered people?”\r\n[p042]\r\n\r\nThe differences between the northern and southern earthworks, pointed\r\nout by Mr. Whittlesey, are not greater than would naturally be\r\nexhibited between the structures of a sparse frontier population,\r\nand those erected by more central and dense communities. Works,\r\ngenerally corresponding with those here described, are found still\r\nfurther to the northward and eastward; extending to the Genesee river\r\nand its tributaries in New-York, and even to the head waters of the\r\nSusquehanna in Pennsylvania,—which seems to have been the extreme\r\nlimit to which the mound-builders penetrated in that direction. From\r\nplans previously presented, it will be seen that precisely analogous\r\nworks occur in Kentucky and Tennessee. It will be seen also, in a\r\nsucceeding chapter, on the “Antiquities of the Southern States,” that\r\nsimilar structures are found in Mississippi, and elsewhere along the\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nThe examples of defensive works here presented will serve to give a\r\nvery accurate conception of this class of structures. By a minute\r\nattention to their various details, we are prepared to estimate the\r\njudgment, skill, and industry of their builders. No one can rise from\r\nsuch an examination, except with the conviction that the race, by\r\nwhom these works were erected, possessed no inconsiderable knowledge\r\nof the science of defence,—a degree of knowledge much superior to\r\nthat known to have been possessed by the hunter tribes of North\r\nAmerica previous to the discovery by Columbus, or indeed subsequent\r\nto that event. Their number and magnitude must also impress the\r\ninquirer with enlarged notions of the power of the people commanding\r\nthe means for their construction, and whose numbers required such\r\nextensive works for their protection. It is not impossible that,\r\nlike the defensive enclosures of the Polynesian Islanders, they were\r\nto a certain extent designed to embrace cultivated fields, so as to\r\nfurnish the means of subsistence to their defenders, in the event of\r\na protracted siege. There is no other foundation, however, for this\r\nsuggestion, than that furnished by the great size of some of them.\r\nThe population that found shelter within their walls must have been\r\nexceedingly large, if their dimensions may be taken as the basis of a\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThere is no positive evidence that the mound-builders fully\r\nunderstood the value of the bastion in their works of defence;\r\nalthough they seem, in some instances, to have secured the projecting\r\npoints of the hills on which their defences are situated, with a\r\nview of enfilading the walls. The fortified hill near the mouth of\r\nthe Great Miami, (Plate IX,) and Fort Hill, in Highland county,\r\nafford examples. These projecting points could however, from their\r\nwide distance apart, but very imperfectly answer the purpose of\r\nbastions; and the supposition that they were thus used is rendered\r\nless probable, from the fact that the walls oftener cut off these\r\npoints than accommodate themselves to them. It is not improbable,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of direct evidence to that effect, that\r\nbastions of wood were erected at intervals along the walls. Such\r\nconstructions would undeniably be the most simple and efficient for\r\nthe purposes desired. The numerous openings in the walls of many of\r\nthese works, although indiscriminately denominated gateways, were\r\nclearly not always designed as such. It is not unwarrantable to\r\nsuppose that they mark the positions of wooden constructions, like\r\nthe block-houses of later times, [p043] which projected beyond the\r\nwalls, and answered the double purpose of bastions and watch-towers.\r\nThe very regular intervals between these openings, particularly in\r\nthe great work on the Little Miami, (Plate VII,) and the Fortified\r\nHill in Highland county, just mentioned, (Plate V,) would seem to\r\nfavor this hypothesis. Of course we cannot now expect to find any\r\ntraces of wooden structures, even if such entered into the original\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\nThe walls of earth and stone which constitute all that remains to us\r\nof these aboriginal fortifications, although often high and heavy,\r\nwould nevertheless, in themselves, furnish very imperfect means of\r\nprotection and resistance. Earth cannot be heaped up so as very much\r\nto impede an assailant; and the stone works, as far as noticed, do\r\nnot appear to have been constructed of stone regularly laid, so\r\nas to present a vertical or inaccessible front to an enemy. These\r\ncircumstances render it sufficiently obvious that the walls were\r\nsurmounted by palisades, or by something equivalent. We are sustained\r\nin this conclusion by the concurrent practices of all nations, known\r\nto construct permanent works of this description. The ramparts of the\r\nRoman camps were strengthened by stakes fixed on the top; and to this\r\nday, the walls of «E’Pas», or entrenched hills of the New Zealanders,\r\nare surmounted by palisades. Such also is the present practice of\r\nsome of the tribes on the Missouri,—the Minatarees, Rickarees, and\r\nothers. The walls of some works, which, from their position and other\r\ncircumstances, are manifestly of defensive origin, are so slight that\r\nit would be absurd to suppose them designed for protection, unless\r\ncrowned with palisades. Most of those of northern Ohio are subject\r\nto this remark. It has been asserted by certain writers on American\r\nantiquities, that traces of palisades are yet to be seen in some of\r\nthem. Aside from the palpable improbability of anything of the sort,\r\nit is proper to remark that no such evidences have been observed in\r\nthe course of our own investigations. A very few years of exposure\r\nwould suffice to obliterate all traces of wood in these constructions.\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to remark the skill with which the\r\ngateways or entrances to these enclosures are sometimes protected by\r\nover-lapping or concentric walls, horn-works, etc. It is rational to\r\nconclude that means were made use of by the builders to close the\r\nentrances effectually, when desired. How this object was accomplished\r\nis, of course, entirely a matter of conjecture. The Australians, in\r\ncase of alarm, completely close their entrenchments with stones or\r\nother obstructions. Entrance is effected only by a succession of\r\nposts of different lengths, like a stile, or by the aid of notched\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIn connection with many of the defensive structures, mounds are\r\noccasionally to be found, so placed as to suggest the purposes\r\nof watch-towers, look-outs, or alarm-posts. They are sometimes\r\nexterior, and sometimes interior to the walls of the enclosures, and\r\noccasionally incorporated with them. Plate XI (Nos. 1 and 3) affords\r\nexamples. It is possible that this was not the primary, perhaps not\r\neven the secondary purpose of these mounds. Proper excavations would\r\nsettle the question. In the absence of these, we can only appeal to\r\nsuch light as analogy affords us in our inquiry. Such mounds were\r\nerected by the ancient Britons for purposes of observation, both\r\nin advance of their other defences and within them; [p044] and\r\nthe early Spanish writers speak of similar erections, for similar\r\npurposes, by the Floridian Indians. The New Zealanders compass the\r\nsame ends by raising a tree, the branches of which have been lopped\r\noff within a few inches of the trunk, at some elevated point within\r\ntheir works.\r\n\r\nThe almost invariable presence of water within, or in immediate\r\nproximity to these enclosures, has been the occasion of frequent\r\nremark in the foregoing descriptions. In the absence of springs and\r\nstreams, as also where, from position, access to such supplies of\r\nwater is impracticable, we find their place supplied by reservoirs;\r\nan evidence of the forethought of the builders, as also an index to\r\nthe true character of the works in which these features occur.\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of labor necessary to the erection of most of these\r\nworks precludes the notion that they were hastily constructed to\r\ncheck a single or unexpected invasion. On the contrary, there seems\r\nto have existed a «System of Defences» extending from the sources\r\nof the Alleghany and Susquehanna in New York, diagonally across the\r\ncountry, through central and northern Ohio, to the Wabash. Within\r\nthis range, the works which are regarded as defensive are largest\r\nand most numerous. If an inference may be drawn from this fact, it\r\nis that the pressure of hostilities was from the north-east; or\r\nthat, if the tide of migration flowed from the south, it received\r\nits final check upon this line. On the other hypothesis, that in\r\nthis region originated a semi-civilization which subsequently spread\r\nsouthward, constantly developing itself in its progress, until\r\nit attained its height in Mexico, we may suppose that from this\r\ndirection came the hostile savage hordes, before whose incessant\r\nattacks the less warlike mound-builders gradually receded, or beneath\r\nwhose exterminating cruelty those who occupied this frontier entirely\r\ndisappeared, leaving these monuments alone to attest their existence,\r\nand the extraordinary skill with which they defended their altars and\r\ntheir homes. Upon either assumption, it is clear that the contest\r\nwas a protracted one, and that the race of the mounds were for a\r\nlong period constantly exposed to attack.[29] This conclusion finds\r\nits support in the fact that, in the vicinity of those localities,\r\nwhere, from the amount of remains, it appears the ancient population\r\nwas most dense, we almost invariably find one or more works of a\r\ndefensive character, furnishing ready places of resort in times\r\nof danger. We may suppose that a condition of things prevailed\r\nsomewhat analogous to that which attended the advance of our pioneer\r\npopulation, when every settlement had its little fort, to which the\r\npeople flocked in case of alarm or attack.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that there existed among the mound-builders\r\na state of society something like that which prevailed among the\r\nIndians; that each tribe had its separate seat, maintaining, with\r\nits own independence, an almost constant warfare against its\r\nneighbors, and, as a consequence, possessing its own “castle,” as\r\na place of final resort when invaded by a powerful foe. Apart from\r\nthe fact, [p045] however, that the Indians were hunters averse to\r\nlabor, and not known to have constructed any works approaching in\r\nskilfulness of design or in magnitude those under notice, there is\r\nalmost positive evidence that the mound-builders were an agricultural\r\npeople, considerably advanced in the arts, possessing a great\r\nuniformity throughout the whole territory which they occupied, in\r\nmanners, habits, and religion,—a uniformity sufficiently well marked\r\nto identify them as a single people, having a common origin, common\r\nmodes of life, and, as an almost necessary consequence, common\r\nsympathies, if not a common and consolidated government.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the North American Indians constructed defensive\r\nworks of this description, is one of much importance, but which\r\ncannot be fully discussed in this connection. All the early writers\r\nconcur in representing that the Indian tribes, from Florida to\r\nCanada, possessed common modes of defending their villages and\r\nprotecting themselves from the attacks of their enemies. Their\r\nfortifications consisted of rows of pickets firmly fixed in the\r\nground, sometimes wattled together, but occasionally placed so far\r\napart, as to permit missiles of various kinds to be discharged\r\nbetween them upon an assailant.[30] They seldom had more than a\r\nsingle entrance, which, among the Floridians, was not direct, but\r\ncircuitous. Entrenchments of earth, consisting of an embankment and\r\nditch, do not appear to have been constructed by them. It seems,\r\nhowever, that of late years, the Indians to the westward of the\r\nMississippi, particularly the Mandans and Rickarees, have constructed\r\nentrenchments of earth, surmounted by palisades.[31] But whether the\r\npractice is of recent introduction or otherwise, it is difficult to\r\nsay. It is stated by Prince Maximilian, in his Travels in America,\r\nthat the defences of the Mandan village of Mih-tutta-hang-kush,\r\nwhich consisted of a wall and ditch, were built by whites, who were\r\nemployed by the Indians for that purpose.[32]\r\n\r\nThe defences of the nations of the central portion of the Continent,\r\nand especially those of the Mexicans and Peruvians, so far as we are\r\ninformed concerning them, bore a close resemblance to those of the\r\nmound-builders, although exhibiting a superiority entirely consonant\r\nwith the further advance which we are justified in supposing they\r\nhad made in all the arts, including the art of defence.[33] Some\r\nreference has already been had to the actual identity which a few\r\nof the defences of the West exhibit with those of Mexico, in some\r\nof their most interesting features. These resemblances might be\r\npointed out in detail, but they will readily suggest themselves to\r\nthe Archæologist. The usual mode of fortification in Peru consisted\r\nin throwing up a series of embankments around the summits of isolated\r\nhills,—a practice which was common among the ancient Celts, and which\r\nis still preserved among the Australian and Polynesian islanders.[34]\r\nUlloa observes, [p046] in respect to their numbers, that “one\r\nscarcely meets with a mountain without them.” Precisely similar modes\r\nof defence prevailed among the savage South American tribes, who\r\ninvariably crowned their entrenchments of earth with palisades of\r\nwood.[35]\r\n\r\nThe traces of ancient fortifications in the northern part of the\r\nState of New York, and upon the head waters of the Susquehanna in\r\nPennsylvania, may, it is believed, be referred with entire safety to\r\nthe same hands with those of the Mississippi valley. It will be seen\r\nthat they have a close resemblance to those of northern Ohio, both in\r\nposition and structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] This observation is confirmed by all who have given attention\r\nto the subject, in the Ohio and Upper Mississippi valleys. Along\r\nthe Gulf, and at points on the Lower Mississippi, where the entire\r\ncountry is low, and subject to inundation, and where the operation\r\nof natural causes is rather to elevate than depress the beds of the\r\nstreams, some of the ancient works are invaded by water.\r\n\r\n[9] This work is marked C in the “«Map of a Section of Six Miles of\r\nthe Paint Creek Valley»,” Plate III.\r\n\r\n[10] It has been suggested that perhaps the walls of stone were\r\nsustained or surmounted by wooden structures of some sort, the\r\ndestruction of which, in whole or in part, by fire, caused the\r\nappearances noticed in the text. The suggestion that these are the\r\ntraces of “ancient furnaces,” is not to be entertained for an instant.\r\n\r\n[11] This work was first described, though not first surveyed,\r\nby Professor LOCKE, of Cincinnati, in 1838. His description and\r\nplan—to the accuracy and fidelity of which every visitor can bear\r\nwitness—were published in the “Second Annual Report of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Ohio.”\r\n\r\n[12] This sandstone, it should be remarked, to prevent\r\nmisapprehension, is the “Waverley sandstone,” underlying the coal\r\nseries, and which is found capping most of the hills in this region.\r\nIt occurs in successive layers, of from a few inches to several feet\r\nin thickness. It is quite friable, and quarries readily.\r\n\r\n[13] “One of the mounds at Marietta must be more than eight hundred\r\nyears old; for Dr. Hildreth counted eight hundred rings of annual\r\ngrowth in a tree which grew upon it.”—«Lyell’s Travels in North\r\nAmerica», vol. ii. p. 29. «See also Second Geological Report of the\r\nState of Ohio», p. 268.\r\n\r\n[14] De Solis describes this Tlascalan work as “a great wall which\r\nran from one mountain to the other, entirely stopping up the way: a\r\nsumptuous and strong piece of building which showed the power and\r\ngreatness of the owner. The outside was of hewn stone cemented with\r\nmortar of extraordinary strength. It was twenty feet thick and a\r\nfathom and a half high; and on the top was a parapet after the manner\r\nof our fortifications. The entrance was narrow and winding; the wall\r\nin that part dividing and making two walls, which circularly crossed\r\neach other for the space of ten paces.”—«History of the Conquest of\r\nMexico, p.» 139.\r\n\r\n[15] An account of this work, accompanied by a very good\r\nplan, appeared in the “Portfolio,” (a periodical published in\r\nPhiladelphia,) for the year 1809. Both plan and description were\r\ncopied by Mr. Atwater, in his memoir, in the first volume of the\r\n“Archæologia Americana.” It was also briefly described by Dr. Drake,\r\nin the chapter on Antiquities contained in his “View of Cincinnati.”\r\nSince that period, it has been the object of frequent visit and\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n[16] Dr. Drake, in the chapter on antiquities, in his “View of\r\nCincinnati,” has the following notice of this work:\r\n\r\n“The adjacent hill, at the distance of half a mile, and at the\r\ngreater elevation of about one hundred feet, is the site of a stone\r\nwall, mainly circular, and enclosing perhaps twenty acres. The valley\r\nof the river on one side, and a deep ravine on the other, render\r\naccess to three-fourths of this fortification extremely difficult.\r\nThe wall is carried generally along the brow of the hill, in one\r\nplace descending a short distance, so as to include a spring. The\r\nsilicious limestone of which it was built, must have been transported\r\nfrom the bed of the river, which, for two miles opposite these works,\r\ndoes not at present afford one of ten pounds weight. They exhibit no\r\nmarks of the hammer or any other tool. The wall was laid up without\r\nmortar, and is now in ruins.”\r\n\r\n[17] Long’s Second Expedition, vol. i, pp. 54–66.\r\n\r\n[18] Surveyed by JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq and SAMUEL FORRER, Esq of the\r\nOhio Board of Public Works.\r\n\r\n[19] The above plan is copied from the map accompanying\r\nHarrison’s published Address before the Historical Society of\r\nOhio.—«Transactions», vol. i. p. 217.\r\n\r\n[20] Transactions Historical Society of Ohio, vol. i. p. 225.\r\n\r\n[21] This work is not placed in the connection which it was designed\r\nto occupy. Its position in the text was determined by circumstances;\r\nand its character will be better understood in the progress of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[22] This plan is from an original, minute survey by the authors. A\r\nplan and description of the same work were published by Mr. Atwater\r\nin the “Archæologia Americana.” It will be found to differ in some\r\nimportant respects.\r\n\r\n[23] Two plans of this work exist among the MSS. of Rafinesque, which\r\ndiffer slightly from each other. One of them coincides, however, in\r\nall important particulars with a plan published some years ago in\r\nthe “Western Messenger,” and has therefore been adopted as probably\r\nessentially correct. The description in the “Messenger,” which seems\r\nto have been written by an intelligent observer, is also adopted.\r\nIt is amply sustained by the account of Judge Haywood, and by other\r\nevidence, and it is thought may be relied on in all respects.\r\n\r\n[24] Haywood’s Tenn. vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[25] This work is laid down from surveys made by S. T. OWEINS,\r\nsurveyor of Greene county, and by L. K. DILLE, M.D. The survey by Mr.\r\nOweins was kindly communicated by W. B. Fairchild, Esq. of Xenia. The\r\nwork has also been personally examined by the authors.\r\n\r\n[26] This work is marked C, in the map of a “«Section of six miles of\r\nthe Miami valley»,” Plate III.\r\n\r\n[27] These relics, as also the skeletons found with them, were\r\nprobably those of the more recent Indians, and constituted a second\r\nand comparatively late deposit. The burned remains, doubtless,\r\nresulted from the original burial by fire. Incremation was\r\nextensively practiced by the mound builders.\r\n\r\n[28] “There is a small enclosure on the south line of Franklin\r\ncounty, and another in Pickaway county, which closely resemble those\r\nalong the lake shore.” See Plate XIV, Nos. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[29] “The Ohio fortresses were not erected for defence against a\r\ncasual invasion.

The small dimensions of most of the circles, the occurrence\r\nof the ditch interior to the embankments, and the fact that many\r\nof them are completely commanded by adjacent heights, are some\r\nof the circumstances which may be mentioned as sustaining this\r\nconclusion.[36] We must seek, therefore, in the connection in which\r\nthese works are found, and in the character of the mounds, if such\r\nthere be within their walls, for the secret of their origin. And\r\nit may be observed, that it is here we discover evidences still\r\nmore satisfactory and conclusive than are furnished by their small\r\ndimensions and the other circumstances above mentioned, that they\r\nwere not intended for defence. Thus, when we find an enclosure\r\ncontaining a number of mounds, all of which it is capable of\r\ndemonstration were «religious» in their purposes, or in some way\r\nconnected with the superstitions of the people who built them, the\r\nconclusion is irresistible, that the enclosure itself was also\r\ndeemed sacred, and thus set apart as “«tabooed»” or consecrated\r\nground,—especially where it is obvious, at the first glance, that it\r\npossesses none of the requisites of a military work. But it is not to\r\nbe concluded that those enclosures alone, which contain mounds of the\r\ndescription here named, were designed for sacred purposes. We have\r\nreason to believe that the religious system of the mound-builders,\r\nlike that of the Aztecs, exercised among them a great, if not a\r\ncontrolling influence. Their government may have been, for aught we\r\nknow, a government of the priesthood; one in which the priestly and\r\ncivil functions were jointly exercised, and one sufficiently powerful\r\nto have secured in the Mississippi valley, as it did in Mexico,\r\nthe erection of many of those vast monuments, which for ages will\r\ncontinue to challenge the wonder of men. There may have been certain\r\nsuperstitious ceremonies, having no connection with the purposes of\r\nthe mounds, carried on in enclosures specially dedicated to them.\r\nThe purposes of the minor enclosures within and connected with the\r\ngreat defensive work already described on the banks of the North fork\r\nof Paint creek, (Plate X,) would scarcely admit of a doubt, even\r\nthough the sacred mounds which they embrace were wanting. It is a\r\nconclusion which every day’s [p048] investigation and observation\r\nhas tended to confirm, that most, perhaps all, of the earthworks not\r\nmanifestly defensive in their character, were in some way connected\r\nwith the superstitious rites of the builders,—though in what precise\r\nmanner, it is, and perhaps ever will be, impossible satisfactorily to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThe general character of these works has already been briefly\r\nindicated. They are mostly regular in their structure, and occupy the\r\nbroad and level river bottoms, seldom occurring upon the table lands\r\nor where the surface of the ground is undulating or broken. They\r\nare usually square or circular in form; sometimes they are slightly\r\nelliptical. Occasionally we find them isolated, but more frequently\r\nin groups. The greater number of the circles are of small size, with\r\na nearly uniform diameter of two hundred and fifty or three hundred\r\nfeet, and invariably have the ditch interior to the wall. These have\r\nalways a single gateway, opening oftenest to the east, though by no\r\nmeans observing a fixed rule in that respect. It frequently happens\r\nthat they have one or more small mounds, of the class denominated\r\nsacrificial, within the walls. These small circles occasionally occur\r\nwithin larger works of a different character. Apart from these,\r\nnumerous little circles, from thirty to fifty feet in diameter, are\r\nobserved in the vicinity of large works. They consist of very slight\r\nembankments of earth, and have no entrances or passage ways. It\r\nhas been suggested that these are the remains of ancient lodges or\r\nbuildings. The accounts which we have of the traces left of the huts\r\nof the Mandans and other Indians, at their deserted villages, render\r\nthis supposition not improbable. It sometimes happens that we find\r\nsmall circles embracing large mounds: these can hardly be regarded as\r\nof the same character with that numerous class already noticed.\r\n\r\nThe larger circles are oftenest found in combination with rectangular\r\nworks, connected with them directly, or by avenues. Some of these\r\ncircles are of great extent, embracing fifty or more acres. They\r\nseldom have a ditch; but whenever it occurs, it is interior to\r\nthe wall. As in the case of the square or rectangular works to\r\nwhich they are attached, (and which, it is believed, «never» have\r\nditches, exterior or interior,) the walls are usually composed\r\nof earth taken up evenly from the surface, or from large pits in\r\nthe neighborhood. Evident care appears in all cases to have been\r\nexercised, in procuring the material, to preserve the surface of\r\nthe adjacent plain smooth, and as far as possible unbroken. This\r\nfact is in itself almost conclusive against the supposition of a\r\ndefensive design, especially as we have abundant evidence that the\r\nmound-builders understood perfectly the value of the external fosse\r\nin their works of defence. The walls of these works are, for the\r\nmost part, comparatively slight, varying from three to seven feet\r\nin height. Sometimes they are quite imposing; as in the case of the\r\ngreat circle at Newark, Licking county, Ohio; where, at the entrance,\r\nthe wall from the bottom of the ditch has a vertical height of not\r\nfar from thirty feet. The square or rectangular works, attending\r\nthese large circles, are of various dimensions. It has been observed,\r\nhowever, that certain groups are marked by a great uniformity of\r\nsize. Five or six of these are noticed in the succeeding pages; they\r\nare «exact» squares, each measuring one thousand and eighty feet\r\nside,—a coincidence which could not possibly be accidental, and\r\nwhich must possess some significance. It certainly establishes the\r\n[p049] existence of some standard of measurement among the ancient\r\npeople, if not the possession of some means of determining angles.\r\nThe rectangular works have almost invariably gateways at the angles\r\nand midway on each side, all of which are covered by small interior\r\nmounds or elevations. In some of the larger structures the openings\r\nare more numerous. A few of this description of remains have been\r\ndiscovered which are octagonal. One of these of large size, in the\r\nvicinity of Chillicothe, has its alternate angles coincident with\r\neach other, and its sides equal.\r\n\r\nAnother class of works, probably akin to those here noticed, are\r\nthe parallels, consisting of slight embankments seven or eight\r\nhundred feet in length and sixty or eighty feet apart. Indeed, so\r\nvarious are these works, and so numerous their combinations, that it\r\nis impossible, through the medium of description alone, to convey\r\nan adequate conception of their character. If we are right in the\r\nassumption that they are of sacred origin, and were the temples\r\nand consecrated grounds of the ancient people, we can, from their\r\nnumber and extent, form some estimate of the devotional fervor or\r\nsuperstitious zeal which induced their erection, and the predominance\r\nof the religious sentiment among their builders.\r\n\r\nTheir magnitude is, perhaps, the strongest objection that can be\r\nurged against the purpose here assigned them. It is difficult to\r\ncomprehend the existence of religious works, extending, with their\r\nattendant avenues, like those near Newark, over an area of little\r\nless than «four square miles»! We can find their parallels only in\r\nthe great temples of Abury and Stonehenge in England, and Carnac in\r\nBrittany, and must associate them with sun worship and its kindred\r\nsuperstitions.\r\n\r\nIt was originally proposed to include within another division those\r\nstructures which were regarded as anomalous, or to which it was\r\nimpossible to assign a definite purpose. Reflection, however, has\r\ntended to strengthen the opinion, that those works not manifestly\r\ndefensive were connected with the superstitions of the builders, and\r\nthat all the enclosures of the West (except perhaps some of the petty\r\ncircles to which allusion has been made) were either military or\r\nreligious in their origin. Those only which are obviously defensive\r\nhave been classed under the head of Defences, and all others have\r\nbeen thrown together into this chapter. It is not impossible,\r\ntherefore, that some which follow should be included in the former\r\ndivision; nor is it improbable that a few were designed to answer a\r\ndouble purpose. [p050]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XVI.[37]\r\n HIGH BANK WORKS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful group here represented is situated on the right bank of\r\nthe Scioto river, five miles below the town of Chillicothe, near the\r\nroad from that place to Jackson. It occurs at a place where the river\r\nhas cut its way up to the third terrace, which in consequence here\r\npresents a bold bank, rising seventy-five or eighty feet above the\r\nwater. This point is generally known as the “«High Bank»,” and gives\r\nits name to these works. The third terrace here spreads out into a\r\nbeautiful, level plain of great extent. The principal work consists\r\nof an octagon and a circle; the former measuring nine hundred and\r\nfifty feet, the latter ten hundred and fifty feet, in diameter.\r\nThe coincidences, in the dimensions, between this and the “Hopeton\r\nWorks,” (Plate XVII,) will be at once observed. The octagon is not\r\nstrictly regular; although its alternate angles are coincident, and\r\nits sides equal. The circle is a perfect one. In immediate connection\r\nwith the work are two small circles, which are shown in the plan,\r\neach measuring two hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the octagon are very bold; and, where they have been\r\nleast subjected to cultivation, are now between eleven and twelve\r\nfeet in height, by about fifty feet base. The wall of the circle is\r\nmuch less, nowhere measuring over four or five feet in altitude. In\r\nall these respects, as in the absence of a ditch and the presence of\r\nthe two small circles, this work resembles the Hopeton Works already\r\nalluded to. There are no mounds, except the small ones covering the\r\ngateways of the octagon. About half a mile to the southward, and\r\nconnected with this work by lines of embankment, much reduced but\r\nstill traceable, is a small group of works, partially destroyed by\r\nthe river. A fourth of a mile below this subordinate group, on the\r\nbank of the terrace, is a large truncated mound, thirty feet in\r\nheight. It does not fall within the area exhibited on the map.\r\n\r\nAt various points around this work are the usual pits or dug holes,\r\nsome of which are of large size. To the left of the great circle, on\r\nthe brow of the terrace, is an Indian burial place. The construction\r\nof a farm road down the bank disclosed a large quantity of human\r\nbones, accompanied by a variety of rude implements. A short distance\r\nbelow this point, on the same bank of the river, is the former site\r\nof an Indian town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVI. High Bank Works, Ross Co., Ohio.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVII. Hopeton Work, Ross Co. Ohio (four miles north of\r\nChillicothe).]\r\n\r\nA number of small circles occur about a hundred rods distant from\r\nthe octagon, in the forest land to the south-east. They measure\r\nnearly fifty feet in diameter, and the walls are about two feet in\r\nheight. It has been suggested that they are [p051] the remains\r\nof structures of some kind, and also that they were the bases of\r\nunfinished mounds. There are no indications of entrances or passage\r\nways, a circumstance which favors the latter hypothesis. Similar\r\nsmall circles occur within or in the immediate vicinity of several\r\nother large works.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XVII.[38]\r\n HOPETON WORKS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nFour miles above the city of Chillicothe, on the east bank of the\r\nScioto river, is situated the singular group of works figured in\r\nthe Plate. They are found upon the third “bottom” or terrace, just\r\nat the base of an elevated plain, upon which, five hundred paces\r\ndistant, and to the right of the main works, the minor group B is\r\nsituated. They consist of a rectangle, with an attached circle, the\r\nlatter extending into the former, instead of being connected with it\r\nin the usual manner. The rectangle measures nine hundred and fifty\r\nby nine hundred feet, and the circle is ten hundred and fifty feet\r\nin diameter. The centre of the circle is somewhat to the right of\r\na line drawn through the centre of the rectangle, parallel to its\r\nlongest sides. The exterior gateways are twelve in number, and have\r\nan average width of about twenty-five feet. The chord of that part\r\nof the circle interior to the rectangle is five hundred and thirty\r\nfeet. On the east side are two circles, measuring two hundred, and\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet in diameter respectively; one covering\r\na gateway, the other extending into, and opening within, the work.\r\nAbout two hundred paces north of the great circle is another smaller\r\none, two hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the rectangular work are composed of a clayey loam,\r\ntwelve feet high by fifty feet base, and are destitute of a ditch on\r\neither side. They resemble the heavy grading of a railway, and are\r\nbroad enough, on the top, to admit the passage of a coach. The wall\r\nof the great circle was never as high as that of the rectangle; yet,\r\nalthough it has been much reduced of late years by the plough, it is\r\nstill about five feet in average height. It is also destitute of a\r\nditch. It is built of clay, which differs strikingly in respect of\r\ncolor from the surrounding soil. The walls of the smaller circles are\r\nabout three feet in height, with interior ditches of corresponding\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nParallel walls extend from the north-western corner of the rectangle,\r\ntowards the river to the south-west. They are twenty-four hundred\r\nfeet, or nearly half a mile [p052] long, and are placed one hundred\r\nand fifty feet apart. They terminate at the edge of the terrace, at\r\nthe foot of which, it is evident, the river once had its course; but\r\nbetween which and the present bed of the stream, a broad and fertile\r\n“bottom” now intervenes. They are carried in a straight line, and\r\nalthough very slight, (nowhere exceeding two and a half feet in\r\nheight,) are uninterrupted throughout. They do not connect directly\r\nwith the main work; at least, they are not traceable near it.\r\n\r\nThere is a dug hole, of considerable size, near the south-east angle\r\nof the rectangular portion of the work, exterior to the walls. In\r\nthe bank of the table land, which approaches to within three or four\r\nhundred feet of the walls, are several excavations, «d d d», from\r\nwhich large quantities of earth have been taken, though much less,\r\napparently, than enters into the composition of the embankments.\r\n\r\nThere are no mounds of magnitude in connection with these works.\r\nThere are two slight elevations of an oval form, and also one or two\r\nvery small mounds, within the square, as shown in the plan. There is\r\na large group, however, on the opposite bank of the river, in the\r\ndirection pursued by the parallels above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe truncated pyramid and accompanying circle, shown in the plan\r\nof the “Cedar Bank Works,” (Plate XVIII,) are situated about\r\none-fourth of a mile to the north-east, upon the superior plain. The\r\ncoincidences between this circle and the small one C of the plan will\r\nbe observed at once. The feature of an inner wall or platform, of the\r\ndescription here indicated, is of frequent occurrence. (See “«Newark\r\nWorks»,” Plate XXV.)\r\n\r\nFrom the height and solidity of the walls, it might be inferred that\r\nthis was a work of defence. But its position, in respect to the\r\nthird terrace which commands it, strongly opposes that conclusion.\r\nStill, this objection would not be insuperable, could we suppose\r\nthat the walls were palisaded; for, in such a case, the interior of\r\nthe work would be unassailable by any missiles known to barbarous\r\nor half-civilized nations,—in fact, proof against anything except\r\nartillery, and affording no mean protection against an assault of\r\nthat description.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XVIII.[39]\r\n CEDAR BANK WORKS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis work is situated upon the table lands bordering the Scioto\r\nriver, at a point five miles above the town of Chillicothe, and\r\nabout a mile above the works last [p053] described. It consists\r\nof a wall and outer ditch, which constitute three sides of a\r\nparallelogram. The fourth side is protected by a natural bank or\r\nbluff, seventy feet high, and so steep as to admit of no ascent,\r\nexcept at one point where it has been gullied by the flow of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVIII. Cedar-bank Works, Ross Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThe walls of this work are about six feet high by forty feet base;\r\nthe ditch five feet deep by forty wide. The ditch upon the longer or\r\neastern side is formed, for two thirds of its length, by a “runway”\r\nor water-course. It is here from eight to ten feet deep. The wall\r\nupon this side is fourteen hundred feet long. The northern and\r\nsouthern walls are each ten hundred and fifty feet in length, and\r\nplaced at right angles to the first; the southern extending to the\r\nvery edge of the bluff, the northern terminating within twenty-five\r\nfeet of it. It is possible that a fourth wall originally bounded the\r\nenclosure on the west, which has been destroyed by the river, in\r\nits encroachments. There are gateways, each sixty feet wide, at the\r\ncentres of the northern and southern sides. Covering the northern\r\ngateway, and two hundred feet interior to it, is an elevated square,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and fifty broad, and\r\nfour feet high. It is ascended from the ends by graded ways, thirty\r\nfeet broad, and in all respects resembles the truncated pyramids or\r\n“elevated squares” of the Marietta Works (Plate XXVI).\r\n\r\nOn the line of the southern embankment, and three hundred feet\r\ndistant from the main work, are singular parallel walls, eight\r\nhundred and seventy feet long and seventy feet apart, connected\r\nat the ends. These walls have no ditch, and have been partially\r\nobliterated by the Chillicothe and Columbus turnpike, which passes\r\nthrough them. In the timbered land, where they are undisturbed, they\r\nare between two and three feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nAbout one third of a mile south of the principal work, is a truncated\r\npyramid, and a small circle, Fig. 9: the former is one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet square at the base, and nine feet in height; the latter\r\nis two hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and has an entrance from\r\nthe south, thirty feet wide. The sides of the pyramidal structure\r\ncorrespond to the cardinal points. The circle has a ditch interior\r\nto the embankment; and has also a broad embankment of about the\r\nsame height with the outer wall, interior to the ditch, upon the\r\nside opposite the entrance. This feature, which is found in many of\r\nthe smaller circles, is illustrated by the plan, and by the section\r\n«b a». This group is so disposed as to command a fine view of the\r\nriver terraces below it; and the headland upon which it is situated\r\nseems to have been artificially smoothed and rounded. The spot is\r\nwell chosen. The “elevated square” has been excavated, but was found\r\nto contain no remains. Upon the edge of the table land, both above\r\nand below this peculiar group, there are various inconsiderable\r\nremains, consisting of small, low terraces, and little mounds and\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine the character of this group of works.\r\nThe principal enclosure partakes of the nature of a defence; but the\r\nbroad gateways and the [p054] regular terrace embraced in the walls,\r\nare features hardly consistent with the hypothesis of a military\r\norigin. The long parallel lines, found in connection with this and\r\nother works, are entirely inexplicable in their design and purposes.\r\nThe most plausible suggestion concerning them is, that they were\r\ndevoted to the celebration of certain games; they may, however, have\r\nbeen connected with religious observances. It has been suggested that\r\nthe gully or “wash” towards the river was originally a graded way to\r\nthe water, and that its present irregularity has been occasioned by\r\nthe rains and storms of centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that there are no mounds of magnitude in\r\nconnection with these works. Upon the opposite side of the river,\r\nhowever, there are a large number, as will be seen in the succeeding\r\nPlate.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XIX.[40]\r\n MOUND CITY, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis plate presents a very interesting group of works. They are\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Scioto river, four miles north\r\nof the town of Chillicothe. The enclosure, designated, from the\r\ngreat number of mounds within its walls, “«Mound City»,” is in many\r\nrespects the most remarkable in the Scioto valley. Through the\r\ngenerous kindness of HENRY SHRIVER, Esq., upon whose estate it is\r\nsituated, the mounds were all permitted to be investigated; and the\r\nwork will, in consequence, be often referred to in the course of this\r\nvolume, particularly when we come to speak of “Mounds.”\r\n\r\nIn outline it is nearly square, with rounded angles, and consists of\r\na simple embankment, between three and four feet high, unaccompanied\r\nby a ditch. Its site is the beautiful level of the second terrace,\r\nand it is still covered with the primitive forest.\r\n\r\nThe first and most striking feature in connection with this work is\r\nthe unusual number of mounds which it contains. There are no less\r\nthan «twenty-four» within its walls. All of these, as above observed,\r\nhave been excavated, and the principal ones found to contain «altars»\r\nand other remains, which put it beyond question that they were places\r\nof «sacrifice», or of superstitious origin. [The evidence in support\r\nof this conclusion will appear in a subsequent chapter on the mounds\r\nand their purposes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIX. Ancient Works, Ross County Ohio (three miles\r\nnorth of Chillicothe).]\r\n\r\nThese mounds seem placed generally without design in respect to\r\neach other, although there is a manifest dependence between those\r\ncomposing the central group, and between those numbered 4 and 5, and\r\n12 and 13. From the principal [p055] mound, numbered 7 in the\r\nplan, after the fall of the leaves, a full view of every part of the\r\nwork and of its enclosed mounds is commanded. This mound is seventeen\r\nfeet high, with a broad base nearly one hundred feet in diameter. The\r\nlong mound, No. 3, is one hundred and forty feet long, by eighty wide\r\nat the base, and ten feet in average height. Broad and deep pits,\r\nfrom which the earth for the construction of the mounds was taken,\r\nsurround the work. The one occurring at the south-western angle, and\r\nof which «a b» exhibits a vertical section, is at this time eighteen\r\nfeet deep, by one hundred and twenty feet in width, and over two\r\nhundred feet in length. The accumulation of vegetable deposit at the\r\nbottom is found, by excavation, to be not less than thirty inches,—a\r\nfact which may assist in an approximate estimate of the age of this\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nThe absence of an exterior ditch, as also the fact that the work is\r\ncommanded from a slightly elevated terrace half a bow-shot to the\r\nleft, seems sufficient to establish that it was not designed for\r\ndefence. The skill, which the illustrations of a previous chapter\r\nconvince us the mound-builders possessed in selecting and fortifying\r\ntheir military positions, is in no degree displayed in this instance.\r\nTaking in view also the character and purposes of the mounds as\r\ndisclosed by excavation, we are certainly well warranted in classing\r\nthis as a sacred work.\r\n\r\nThe custom of enclosing the Adoratorios or Teocallis, upon which\r\ntheir sacrifices and religious rites generally were practised, was\r\nuniversal among the Mexicans. The open temples of the ancient Britons\r\nwere embraced within parapets of earth, usually, if not always,\r\ncircular in form. The “tabooed” grounds or sacred places of the\r\nPacific Islanders, are also surrounded, if not by earthen, by stone\r\nwalls or by palisades.\r\n\r\nOne fourth of a mile to the north-west of this work is a small circle\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet in diameter, accompanied by two large\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\nAbout the same distance to the south is another work of somewhat\r\nsimilar outline, but of larger size. It is, moreover, surrounded by\r\na ditch. Its position, in respect to “Mound City,” requires that\r\nit should be noticed here. The plan and sections will convey a\r\nsufficiently accurate idea of its form and construction. Unlike the\r\nworks obviously of sacred origin, which, if they possess a ditch\r\nat all, have it interior to the wall, this has an outer fosse; a\r\ncircumstance which would seem to favor the suggestion of a defensive\r\norigin. On the other hand, it has a mound, very nearly if not exactly\r\nin its centre, which was clearly a place of sacrifice. It was found,\r\nupon excavation, to contain an altar singularly constructed of small\r\nstones, carefully imbedded in sand, forming a paved concavity,\r\nupon which were the usual traces of fire, and the remains of the\r\nsacrifice. This mound will be minutely noticed elsewhere. [p056]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XX.[41]\r\n ANCIENT WORK, LIBERTY TOWNSHIP, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis work is a very fair type of a singular series occurring in the\r\nScioto valley,—all of which have the same figures in combination,\r\nalthough occupying different positions with respect to each other,\r\nviz. a square and two circles. These figures are not only accurate\r\nsquares and perfect circles, but are in most cases of corresponding\r\ndimensions,—that is to say, the sides of each of the squares are each\r\nten hundred and eighty feet in length; and the diameter of each of\r\nthe large and small circles, a fraction over seventeen hundred and\r\neight hundred feet, respectively. Such were the results of surveys\r\nmade at different times, the measurements of which correspond within\r\na few feet. Although in the progress of investigation singular\r\ncoincidences were observed between these works, yet there was at the\r\ntime no suspicion of the identity which subsequent comparison has\r\nshown to exist.\r\n\r\nThe first of the series here represented, is situated on the east\r\nbank of the Scioto river, and occupies the third bottom or terrace.\r\nThe ground upon which it occurs is level. The walls of the entire\r\nwork are unaccompanied by a ditch, and are slight, nowhere more than\r\nfour feet in height. The embankment of the square is perceptibly\r\nheavier than that of the small circle, which is also heavier than\r\nthat of the larger one. The square work measures ten hundred and\r\neighty feet upon each side; and its walls are interrupted at the\r\ncorners and at the middle of each side, by gateways thirty feet in\r\nwidth. The central gateways are each covered by a small mound, of\r\nabout the same height with the embankment, and placed forty feet\r\ninterior to it. The manner in which the circular works are connected\r\nwith the square enclosure, and the relative position of each, are\r\naccurately shown in the plan, precluding the necessity of a long and\r\nintricate description. It will be observed, that while the wall of\r\nthe larger circle is interrupted by numerous narrow gateways, that\r\nof the smaller one is entire throughout,—a feature for which it is,\r\nof course, impossible to assign a reason. Besides the small mounds\r\nat the gateways, there are three others within the work, two of\r\nwhich are inconsiderable, while the other is of the largest size,\r\nbeing one hundred and sixty feet long, by not far from twenty feet\r\nhigh. A section of this mound is given, illustrative of a detailed\r\ndescription, in a subsequent chapter. There are also a few other\r\nmounds outside of the walls, reference to which is had elsewhere.\r\nNumerous dug holes occur in the vicinity of the great mound. Most\r\nof these are interior to the work,—a very unusual circumstance. In\r\nfact, the whole work appears to have been but partially finished, or\r\nconstructed in great haste. The mounds at the gateways, and those\r\noutside of [p057] the walls, were formed by carelessly scooping\r\nup the earth at their base, leaving irregular pits near them. In most\r\nof the regular works, the material seems to have been taken up evenly\r\nand with care, or brought from a distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XX. Ancient Work, Liberty Township, Ross Co. Ohio.\r\n(eight miles S. E. of Chillicothe).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXI. Ancient Works, Ross Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nNo one would be apt to ascribe a defensive origin to this work, yet\r\nit is difficult to conceive for what other purpose a structure of\r\nsuch dimensions, embracing nearly one hundred acres, could have been\r\ndesigned. The great mound is anomalous in its character, and throws\r\nno light on the question. That there is some hidden significance, in\r\nthe first place in the regularity, and secondly in the arrangement of\r\nthe various parts, can hardly be doubted. Nor can the coincidences\r\nobservable between this and the other succeeding works of the same\r\nseries be wholly accidental.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXI. No. 1.[43]\r\n\r\nThis work is situated on the right bank of Paint creek, fourteen\r\nmiles distant from Chillicothe. It is but another combination of the\r\nfigures composing the work belonging to this series, just described;\r\nfrom which, in structure, it differs in no material respect, except\r\nthat the walls are higher and heavier. It is one of the best\r\npreserved works in the valley; the only portion which is much injured\r\nbeing [p058] at that part of the great circle next the hill, where\r\nthe flow of water has obliterated the wall for some distance. The\r\ngateways of the square are considerably wider than those of the other\r\nworks,—being nearly seventy feet across. A large, square, truncated\r\nmound occurs at some distance to the north of this work. It is one\r\nhundred and twenty feet broad at the base, has an area fifty feet\r\nsquare on the top, and is fifteen feet high. Quantities of coarse,\r\nbroken pottery are found on and around it. A deep pit, or dug hole,\r\nis near, denoting the spot whence the earth composing the mound was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXI. No. 2.[44]\r\n\r\nFive miles above the work last described, at “the crossings of Paint\r\ncreek,” and on the opposite bank of the stream, occurs an equally\r\nsingular and interesting work, situated upon the estate of JOHN\r\nWOODBRIDGE, Esq., of Chillicothe. The ground is here considerably\r\nbroken, yet the work preserves its regularity throughout, although\r\nevidently constructed with some regard to the nature of the position.\r\nThe square occupies the second terrace; while the main body of the\r\nwork is placed upon the third, as shown in the plan.\r\n\r\nWithin the larger circle, and not far from its centre, is a large\r\nelliptical mound, two hundred and forty feet long by one hundred and\r\nsixty broad, and thirty in height. It is considerably larger than\r\nany other single mound in the valley, and covers a little more than\r\ntwo thirds of an acre. It seems to be composed, at least towards the\r\nsurface, of stones and pebbles,—a feature peculiar to a certain class\r\nof mounds, of a highly interesting character. It is surrounded by a\r\nlow, indistinct embankment, the space between which and the mound\r\nseems to have been raised by the wasting of the latter. Perhaps this\r\nwas a low terrace. To the right of this fine mound is a group of\r\nthree others in combination, as shown in the plan at «c». There are\r\nseveral other small mounds in and around the work. Several very large\r\nand beautiful ones, composed entirely of clay, occur about one fourth\r\nof a mile distant, in the direction indicated in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe entire work is surrounded by deep pits or excavations, usually\r\ncalled “wells,” from which the materials for the mounds and\r\nembankments were procured. So numerous are these, and such serious\r\nobstacles are the mounds and embankments to cultivation, that a\r\ndeduction of several acres is allowed to the tenant in consequence,\r\nby the lease of the estate upon which they occur.\r\n\r\nThe small circle at «a» is two hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\r\nIt has been so much reduced by the plough as to be traced with\r\ndifficulty.[45] [p059]\r\n\r\nAlthough the square enclosure connected with this work is situated\r\non the second terrace, a portion of it, at periods of great freshets,\r\nis invaded by the water, which passes through a shallow thoroughfare\r\nindicated on the map. This singular circumstance is easily accounted\r\nfor. The creek in its course strikes the base of a high hill at B,\r\ncomposed of shale, which readily undermines, occasioning great slips\r\nor slides. These fill the channel of the creek, damming it up and\r\nforcing it out of its usual course. It was probably at the period of\r\none of these slides, that the creek, in its reaction on the opposite\r\nshore, broke through the embankment and formed the thoroughfare,\r\nor dry channel, above mentioned. The remark, therefore, that the\r\nearthworks of the West never occur upon the first, or latest-formed\r\nterrace, and are always above high-water mark, is not at all\r\ninvalidated by this circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXI. No. 3.[46]\r\n\r\nThis work very closely resembles the one last described. It is\r\nsituated on the Scioto river, about one mile south of the town of\r\nChillicothe. Near it was erected the first civilized habitation in\r\nthe valley, and the ground has been in cultivation for more than\r\nforty years. As a consequence, the walls are much reduced, although\r\ndistinctly traceable at this time. A portion of the square has been\r\ndestroyed by the invasion of the river. The large circle has also\r\nbeen encroached upon at some period, if indeed it was ever completed.\r\nIt extends to the terrace bank, which is here twelve or fifteen feet\r\nhigh. The low bottom, at the base of the terrace, was evidently at\r\none time the bed of Paint creek, which has since changed its channel,\r\nand now runs more than a mile to the south-west, entering the river\r\nthree or four miles below this point. If the encroachment upon the\r\nwork was made by this stream, the fact would certainly assign to it a\r\nvery high antiquity. There are no mounds in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthis work, although there are several in the direction indicated in\r\nthe plan, about one fourth of a mile distant, upon the corresponding\r\nterrace A. There is also an extensive and intricate series of works\r\nin the direction of Chillicothe, a portion of which once occupied the\r\nsite of the city.[47]\r\n\r\nOne of the mounds at A is placed upon a singular ridge, some forty\r\nor fifty feet in height, which has resisted the encroachments of the\r\nwater, and which itself somewhat resembles an artificial structure.\r\nThis elevation commands the entire plain. There are several mounds\r\nat its base, one of which is of considerable size. All have been\r\nexcavated: the larger one was found to be sepulchral in its\r\ncharacter; the others are anomalous. [p060]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is sixteen miles distant from the one last described, and\r\nis situated on the left bank of the North fork of Paint creek. A\r\nportion of it is included in the town limits of Frankfort, better\r\nknown as “Oldtown,” or “Old Chillicothe.”[48]\r\n\r\nThe combination of the great circle and the square, in this work,\r\nis identical with that which exists in the celebrated Circleville\r\nwork,—which work, it may be observed, is no more remarkable than\r\nnumbers of others, and owes its celebrity entirely to the fact, that\r\nit has been several times described with some minuteness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nA reduced plan of the Circleville work, Fig. 10, is herewith\r\npresented, which will sufficiently illustrate this remark. Its\r\ndimensions were considerably less than those of the analogous\r\nstructures already described. The sides of the square measured not\r\nfar from nine hundred feet in length, and the diameter of the circle\r\nwas a little more than one thousand feet. The work was peculiar in\r\nhaving a double embankment constituting the circle. It is now almost\r\nentirely destroyed, and its features are no longer traceable.[49]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the rectangular portion of the Frankfort work, where\r\nnot obliterated by the improvements of the town, are still several\r\nfeet high. They were, within the recollection of many people, much\r\nhigher. They are composed of clay (while the embankment of the circle\r\nis composed of gravel and loam), which, as in the case of the square\r\nwork described, Plate X, appears to have been very much burned.\r\n\r\nThe isolated mound near the upper boundary of the circle is composed\r\nentirely of clay, and is twelve feet high; the others are of gravel,\r\nthe largest being no less than twenty feet in altitude. Various dug\r\nholes or pits, from which the material for the embankments and mounds\r\nwas evidently taken, are indicated in the plan. Some of them are, at\r\nthis time, fifteen or twenty feet deep. The subsoil at this locality,\r\nas shown by excavation, is clay. If there was no design, therefore,\r\nin constructing the walls of the square of that material, it follows\r\nthat it was built last, and after the loam and gravel had been\r\nremoved from the pits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXII.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Blackwater Group. Ross Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Junction Group, Ross Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nA portion of the large circle has been encroached upon and destroyed\r\nby the [p061] creek, which has since receded something over a\r\nfifth of a mile, leaving a low rich bottom intervening.\r\n\r\nSuch are the predominant features of this remarkable series of\r\nworks. As already remarked, the coincidences observable between them\r\ncould not have been the result of accident, and it is very manifest\r\nthat they were erected for common purposes. What those purposes\r\nwere, the reader must judge. Without entering into an argument upon\r\nthe subject, we may content ourselves with the simple expression\r\nof opinion, that they were in some manner connected with the\r\nsuperstitions of the builders.\r\n\r\nThere is one deduction to be drawn from the fact, that the figures\r\nentering into these works are of uniform dimensions, which is of\r\nconsiderable importance in its bearing upon the state of knowledge\r\namong the people who erected them. It is that «the builders possessed\r\na standard of measurement, and had some means of determining angles».\r\nThe most skilful engineer of the day would find it difficult, without\r\nthe aid of instruments, to lay down an accurate square of the great\r\ndimensions of those above represented, measuring as they do more\r\nthan «four fifths» of a mile in circumference. It would not, it\r\nis true, be impossible to construct circles of considerable size,\r\nwithout instruments; the difficulty of doing so, when we come to the\r\nconstruction of works five thousand four hundred feet, or «over a\r\nmile» in circumference, is nevertheless apparent. But we not only\r\nfind accurate squares and perfect circles, but also, as we have seen,\r\n«octagons» of great dimensions. Other evidences tending to sustain\r\nthe above conclusions will be adduced in the progress of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXII. No. 1.[50]\r\n JUNCTION GROUP, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe singular group of works here represented is situated on Paint\r\ncreek, two miles south-west of the town of Chillicothe. It consists\r\nof four circles, three crescents, two square works, and four mounds.\r\nThe eastern enclosure is the principal one; and, in common with all\r\nthe rest, consists of a wall three feet high, with an interior ditch.\r\nIt is two hundred and forty feet square, the angles much curved,\r\ngiving it very nearly the form of a circle. The area, bounded by the\r\nditch, is an accurate square of one hundred and sixty feet side, and\r\nis entered from the south by a gateway twenty-five feet wide. To the\r\nsouth-west of this work, and one hundred and thirty feet distant, is\r\na small mound enclosed by a ditch and wall, with [p062] a gateway\r\nopening to it from the north. The ditch dips from the base of the\r\nmound, which is but three feet high by thirty feet base. Almost\r\ntouching the circle enclosing the mound, is the horn of a crescent\r\nwork, having a chord of one hundred and thirty-two feet. Sixty-six\r\nfeet distant, in the same direction, is still another crescent, which\r\nterminates in a mound of sacrifice, seven feet high by forty-five\r\nfeet base, which commands the entire group of works. This mound was\r\ncarefully opened in October, 1845. The following passages, from the\r\nnotes taken on the occasion, may not be out of place here. They will\r\nprove more intelligible to the reader, after an examination of the\r\nchapters on «Mounds».\r\n\r\nThe mound is composed of clay. A simple shaft was sunk from the\r\napex, five feet square. About three feet below the surface, upon the\r\nnorthern side of the excavation, was found a layer of wood coals,\r\nthree or four inches in thickness, which extended within range of\r\nthe excavation perhaps a foot, where it was broken up and intermixed\r\nwith the clay composing the mound; some fragments were found within\r\na few inches of the surface. From this fact it was inferred that the\r\nmound had been disturbed since its erection,—with what correctness\r\nwill be seen in the sequel. In this layer of charcoal was found a\r\nhuman skeleton, much decayed, the skull and jaws crushed. Proceeding\r\ndownwards, the earth below the unbroken charcoal was homogeneous,\r\nwhile towards the centre of the mound it was intermixed with detached\r\ncoals. About seven feet beneath the surface of the mound, and\r\nprobably a little below the surface of the adjacent plain, and in the\r\ncentre of the excavation, were found three skeletons, in a very good\r\nstate of preservation. The earth above them was mingled with coals,\r\nand also with fragments of hard-burned clay, which were immediately\r\nrecognised as portions of the “altar” peculiar to a certain class of\r\nmounds devoted to religious purposes. It was clear that the mound\r\nhad been opened, and its structure broken up, to afford the rite of\r\nsepulture to the skeletons here found; and it was concluded from\r\nthis fact, as well as from their well-preserved condition, that\r\nthe remains were those of the later Indians, who frequently buried\r\nin the mounds. The skeletons were placed side by side, with their\r\nheads towards the east. But one circumstance weighs against the\r\nabove conclusion, and that is the depth at which the skeletons were\r\ndeposited. The modern Indians bury in shallow graves.\r\n\r\nFurther examination disclosed the remains of the altar, about one\r\nthird of which remained entire. Upon it were found a number of\r\nrelics, clearly pertaining to the mound-builders.\r\n\r\nThe character of the remaining works is sufficiently apparent,\r\nwithout further explanation. That they were not designed for defence\r\nis obvious, and that they were devoted to religious rites is more\r\nthan probable. They may have answered a double purpose, and may\r\nhave been used for the celebration of games, of which we can have\r\nno definite conception. It has been suggested that the enclosure\r\nA, as also B and C, were occupied by structures, temples perhaps,\r\nwhich in the lapse of time have disappeared. Similar groups are\r\nfrequent,—indeed, small circles, resembling those here represented,\r\nconstitute, in the Scioto valley, by far the most numerous class\r\nof remains. They seldom occur singly, but generally in connection\r\nwith several others of the same description, and accompanied by one\r\nor more [p063] mounds; sometimes they are connected with long\r\nparallel lines of embankments, of which more particular mention is\r\nelsewhere made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIII.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Dunlap’s Works, Ross Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Ancient Works, Athens Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThis group occupies a beautiful plain forming the third terrace,\r\nupon the edge of which, at D, is a mound, formerly of considerable\r\ndimensions, but now much reduced in altitude. Upon the opposite bank\r\nof the creek, and occupying the corresponding terrace, are other\r\nworks, consisting of a small circle and a number of small mounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXII. No. 2.\r\n BLACKWATER GROUP, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis group, which very much resembles that last described, is\r\nsituated on the right bank of the Scioto river, eight miles above\r\nChillicothe, near the Columbus road. It is specially remarkable for\r\nits singular parallels, A and B of the plan. Each of these is seven\r\nhundred and fifty feet long by sixty broad, measuring from centre to\r\ncentre of the embankments. They are in cleared ground, which has been\r\ncultivated for more than twenty years; consequently the walls are\r\nmuch reduced, being now scarcely two feet in height. A gateway opens\r\ninto the southern parallel, from the east. A corresponding opening\r\nmay have existed in the other parallel, though it is impossible to\r\ndiscern it now. The ground embraced in the semi-circular works C\r\nand D is reduced several feet below the level of the plain on which\r\nthey are located. The mounds belonging to this group have never been\r\ninvestigated; hence their character is undetermined. The group is\r\nintroduced in this connection, on account of its resemblance to the\r\none just described. It is just to conclude that both were erected for\r\na common or analogous purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIII. No. 1.[51]\r\n DUNLAP’S WORKS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis work, situated on the right bank of the Scioto river, six\r\nmiles above Chillicothe, presents some remarkable features. It is\r\nrhomboidal in figure, with an avenue eleven hundred and thirty feet\r\nlong extending to the south-east, and also a [p064] short avenue,\r\nleading from a gateway to the north, connecting with a small circle.\r\nAlong the western wall runs the bank of a plain, elevated a number\r\nof feet above the level of the work, upon the very brow of which is\r\nsituated an outwork (A) eighty feet wide by two hundred and eighty\r\nin length. It overlooks the larger work, and has a wide gateway\r\nopening towards it. At this point the bank seems to have been graded\r\nto a more gentle descent. The great avenue approaches to within\r\nsixty feet of the gateway at «a», which is one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet wide; the walls closing, at the other extremity, upon a radius\r\nof half the width of the avenue. A low mound occupies the extreme\r\npoint of the avenue. At some distance south of the main work, is a\r\nmound surrounded by a ditch and low embankment; and at the distance\r\nof about half a mile, very nearly in the course of the avenue, are a\r\nnumber of mounds,—one of which is fifteen feet high, truncated, and\r\nwith a base of one hundred feet diameter. The diameter of the level\r\narea on the top is about fifty feet. These mounds stand on the lowest\r\nportion of the second terrace; the ground which they occupy being\r\noverflowed at periods of very high water in the river. These are the\r\nonly monuments known which are reached by overflows. The top of the\r\ntruncated mound was made a place of refuge, during the high water of\r\n1832, by a family, with their cattle, horses, etc., numbering in all\r\nnearly a hundred. It was among the first opened, in the progress of\r\nthese investigations, and before the characteristics of this class\r\nof works were clearly known. Hence, although a number of skeletons\r\nwere disinterred, at depths of from two to five feet, together with\r\na few rude instruments, the original deposit of the mound-builders\r\nwas not reached. The skeletons were unquestionably those of the\r\nmodern Indians. Upon the mound and around it, many fragments of rough\r\npottery are found, and a number of entire vases of rude workmanship\r\nwere exposed a few years since in ploughing over an adjacent small\r\nmound. Many decayed fresh-water shells are also found on and around\r\nthe mound; and, as these when pulverized entered into the composition\r\nof the rude pottery of the more recent Indians, it seems highly\r\nprobable that a sort of manufactory of this ware was established\r\nhere. A number of large mounds also occur at some distance to the\r\nnorthward of the principal work.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIII. No. 2.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, ATHENS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nFour miles north of the town of Athens, Athens county, Ohio, is\r\na broad and level plain, upon which is situated a large group of\r\nancient earthworks. The accompanying plan and description were\r\nfurnished by S. P. HILDRETH, M. D., of Marietta, Ohio.[52] [p065]\r\n\r\n“The plain upon which these remains occur is not far from a mile and\r\na half long, by a mile and a quarter broad, and contains upwards of\r\none thousand acres. The soil is a sandy argillaceous earth, easily\r\ntilled and quite fertile. At the northern extremity of the plain is\r\nthe village of Chauncey, where are located several salt factories,\r\nwhich are supplied by some of the most abundant saline waters in\r\nthe State of Ohio. The plain has an elevation of sixty or seventy\r\nfeet above the present bed of the Hocking river, and was evidently\r\nformed when its waters flowed at a higher level. This stream now runs\r\nfrom half a mile to a mile to the eastward of the plain, separated\r\nfrom it by low hills. All around the margin of the plain, where not\r\nbordered by hills, burst forth copious springs of fresh water, which\r\nare most abundant in the vicinity of the principal ancient works.\r\nMost of these works occupy the south-eastern portion of the plain.\r\nThey consist of a number of small circles, accompanied by mounds,\r\nthe several dimensions of which are given in the accompanying plan.\r\nThe largest circle is situated upon a detached point of land, of the\r\nsame level with the adjacent plain, from which it is cut off by a\r\ndeep ravine, in which flows a small stream. This detached portion\r\ncontains not far from six acres. The circle itself has a diameter of\r\ntwo hundred and ten feet; the diameter of the enclosed area is one\r\nhundred and thirty feet; the height of the wall is «seven» feet, and\r\nthe depth of the ditch «six» feet. In all of these circles, the ditch\r\nis interior to the embankment.\r\n\r\n“On the top of a hill, half a mile to the south of this plain, is\r\na stone mound fifteen feet in height. It is built of stones of\r\nvarious sizes, none of which, however, are larger than one man could\r\nconveniently carry. They must have been collected from considerable\r\ndistances, as there are very few lying upon the surface of the\r\nadjacent hills. Many of them are water-worn, and evidently came from\r\nthe bed of some stream: some are limestone, some sandstone, and\r\nothers quartz. About twenty years since a partial excavation was\r\nmade, and the mound penetrated to about half its depth. Here were\r\nfound three human skeletons, in tolerable preservation. From the\r\nappearance of ashes and charcoal beneath them, it was conjectured\r\nthat the bodies had been burned. One of the skeletons had copper\r\nbracelets on its arms, and beads made of the tusks of the bear about\r\nits neck. These relics are now deposited in the Museum of the Ohio\r\nUniversity, at Athens.”\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested, that the work situated upon the detached\r\nportion of the plain above mentioned was designed for defence. There\r\nis nothing to favor the suggestion, except the fact of position,\r\nwhich is far from conclusive. On the other hand, the small size of\r\nthe work, its form, and the occurrence of the ditch «interior» to\r\nthe wall, may be taken to establish a different origin,—probably a\r\nreligious one. [p066]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIV.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, PIKE COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe plan so fully illustrates the character of this group of works,\r\nthat little description is necessary. It consists principally of the\r\nconstantly recurring figures, the square and the circle; the former\r\nmeasuring in this instance a little upwards of eight hundred feet\r\nupon each side, the latter ten hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\r\nThey are connected by parallel walls, four hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet long, placed one hundred feet apart. These are intersected by\r\na runway, which has here cut a passage in the terrace one hundred\r\nand twenty-five feet wide, by fifteen deep. This gully or ravine was\r\nundoubtedly in existence at the period of the construction of the\r\nworks. The banks between the parallels appear to have an offset, as\r\nif they had been artificially graded; no further indications of a\r\ngrade now exist.\r\n\r\nThe small works, in connection with the above, will attract special\r\nattention. The plan illustrates their forms, and the sections exhibit\r\ntheir dimensions. Nothing can surpass the symmetry of the small\r\nwork A, of which an enlarged plan is herewith given, Fig. 11; B and\r\nC are also perfect figures of their kind. It will be remarked that\r\nwe have here the square, the circle, and the ellipse, separate and\r\nin combination,—all of them constructed with geometric accuracy.\r\nThe work D consists of a small circle, from which leads off a wall,\r\nextending along the brow of the terrace bank, until the latter turns,\r\nnearly at right angles, towards the north. It would seem that this\r\nline of embankment was constructed with specific reference to this\r\nnatural feature. The fact, however, that a small circle, in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, has been partially destroyed by the wasting of\r\nthe bank, shows that it has receded since the construction of the\r\nworks. The river now runs at a distance, although it is evident that\r\nit once washed the base of the terrace at this point. Its ancient bed\r\nis distinctly to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the square coincide very nearly with the cardinal\r\npoints of the compass, varying therefrom but three degrees. This is,\r\nhowever, an accidental coincidence; as all the ancient works seem to\r\nhave been made to conform to the position of the ground which they\r\noccupy. There is no evidence that any regard was had to the points\r\nof the compass, except that the gateways or openings of the small\r\ncircles are oftenest towards the east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIV. Ancient Work, Seal Township, Pike Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXV. Newark Works, Licking Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nAbout one mile to the northward of this group is the unique work\r\nshown in the [p067] supplementary plan N. Its walls are about\r\nfour feet high, and its outlines beautifully distinct.[53]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to resist the conviction that some significance\r\nattaches to these singular forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXV.\r\n THE NEWARK WORKS, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO.[54]\r\n\r\nThe very extensive and complicated series of works here presented\r\noccur at the junction of the South and Raccoon forks of Licking\r\nriver, one mile west of the town of Newark, Licking county, Ohio.\r\nLike those at Marietta, the works in question occupy a high fertile\r\nplain. This plain is here of great extent, and elevated from thirty\r\nto fifty feet above the alluvions bordering the streams: it is for\r\nthe most part level, but in places broken and undulating.\r\n\r\nThese works are so complicated, that it is impossible to give\r\nanything like a comprehensible description of them. The plan, with\r\nthe illustrative supplementary plans and sections, will furnish a\r\nbetter conception, as a whole and in detail, than could be afforded\r\nin any other way. It will be the object of the text to supply such\r\ninformation as cannot be obtained from the plan.\r\n\r\nThe group covers an extent of about two miles square, and consists,\r\nas will be observed, of three grand divisions, connected by parallels\r\nand works of a minor character. The walls of the parallels, and of\r\nthe irregular portions of the works generally, as well as of the\r\nsmall circles, (of which there are a considerable number,) are very\r\nslight; for the most part not exceeding four feet in height. [p068]\r\nThe embankments of the principal, or regular portions of the works,\r\nare much heavier. Those of the larger circular work, E, are about\r\ntwelve feet in perpendicular height by fifty feet base, and have an\r\ninterior ditch seven feet deep by thirty-five wide. At the gateway or\r\nentrance, the walls are much higher than at any other point, being\r\nnot less than «sixteen feet» in altitude, with a ditch «thirteen\r\nfeet» deep, giving an absolute height of about «thirty feet» from\r\nthe bottom of the ditch to the top of the embankment. The wall of\r\nthe lesser circle, F, is six feet in height, and is unaccompanied by\r\na ditch. The walls of the octagonal, as well as of the square work,\r\nare but five and a half feet high, and are also destitute of ditches,\r\neither exterior or interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe circular structure E is undoubtedly one of the best preserved and\r\nmost imposing in the State. There are many enclosing larger areas,\r\nbut none more clearly defined. At the entrance, which is towards\r\nthe east, the ends of the walls curve outwards, for the distance\r\nof a hundred feet, leaving a passageway eighty feet wide, between\r\nthe deep ditches on either hand. Here, covered with the gigantic\r\ntrees of a primitive forest, the work presents a truly grand and\r\nimpressive appearance; and, in entering the ancient avenue for the\r\nfirst time, the visitor does not fail to experience a sensation of\r\nawe, such as he might feel in passing the portals of an Egyptian\r\ntemple, or in gazing upon the silent ruins of Petra of the desert.\r\nThis work is not, as has been generally represented, a true circle;\r\nits form is that of an ellipse, its diameters being twelve hundred\r\nand fifty feet, and eleven hundred and fifty feet respectively. There\r\nare two or three slight irregularities in the outline, too trifling\r\nhowever to be indicated in the plan. The area of the enclosure is\r\nsomething over thirty acres. It is an almost perfect level, and is\r\nstill covered with the original forest. Immediately in the centre of\r\nthe area is a mound of singular shape, of which an enlarged plan,\r\nFig. 12, is here given. It much resembles some of the “animal-shaped\r\nmounds” of Wisconsin, and was probably designed to represent a bird\r\nwith expanded wings. It can hardly be called a mound, but is rather a\r\ngroup of four, so arranged and connected as to constitute an unbroken\r\noutline. Denominating the figure, for the sake of distinction, «a\r\nbird», the dimensions are as follows: Length of body, one hundred and\r\nfifty-five feet; of each wing, one hundred and ten feet; between the\r\ntips of the wings, measuring in a right line, two hundred feet; width\r\nof body, sixty-three feet; of wings, in centre, forty-five feet;\r\nof same, next the body, forty feet; height of mounds composing the\r\nbody, seven feet; of mounds composing the wings, five feet. The head\r\nof the bird points directly towards the entrance of the enclosure.\r\nThe bearing of the body is S. 65° E. Immediately in the rear of the\r\neffigy, and one hundred feet distant, is a semi-circular embankment,\r\nabout two hundred feet in length; it is but slightly elevated, and\r\ncan hardly be traced; it is nevertheless exhibited in the plan. The\r\nlong mound, constituting the body of the bird, has been opened.\r\nUpon examining the excavation, it was found that the structure had\r\noriginally contained an «altar»: whether any relics were found upon\r\nit, is unknown. This feature, in conjunction with others, seems\r\n[p069] to point out a religious or superstitious design to this\r\nindividual structure, if not to the whole group of works with which\r\nit is connected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—A GATEWAY OF OCTAGON, LOOKING INWARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nPassing over the intermediate intricate works, of which it would\r\nbe futile to attempt a description, we come to the octagon and its\r\ndependencies. The angles of this octagon, it will be observed, are\r\nnot coincident, although its sides are very nearly equal. At each\r\nof the angles is a gateway, which is covered upon the interior by\r\na small, truncated pyramidal elevation, (Fig. 14,) five feet in\r\nheight, and measuring eighty by one hundred feet at the base. These\r\nare placed about sixty feet interior to the walls. The area of this\r\nwork, which is a rich and beautiful level, is something over fifty\r\nacres. Connected with the octagon by parallels three hundred feet\r\nlong, and placed sixty feet apart, is the smaller circle F. Unlike\r\nthe other circular work, «this is a true circle», two thousand eight\r\nhundred and eighty feet, or upwards of half a mile in circumference.\r\nIt encloses no mounds, but possesses a remarkable feature in the\r\nline of the wall, at a point immediately opposite the entrance. This\r\nconsists of a crown work, (Fig. 15,) which is wholly unlike anything\r\nheretofore noticed. It would almost seem that the builders had\r\noriginally determined to carry out parallel lines from this point;\r\nbut after proceeding one hundred feet, had suddenly changed their\r\nminds and finished the enclosure, by throwing an immense mound across\r\nthe uncompleted parts. This mound, which may be taken as constituting\r\na part of the wall of the enclosure, is one hundred and seventy feet\r\nlong, eight feet higher than the general line of the embankment, and\r\noverlooks the entire work. It has been called the “Observatory,”\r\nfrom this fact: it probably had some other purpose than that of a\r\nlook-out, but what purpose, it is not undertaken to say. It has\r\nbeen pretty thoroughly excavated, but the excavations seem to have\r\ndisclosed nothing, except an abundance of rough stones, which must\r\nhave been brought from the creek or some other remote locality, as\r\nnone are scattered over the remarkable plain upon which these works\r\nare situated. [p070]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. VIEW OF “OBSERVATORY” FROM THE INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nFrom the octagon lead off three lines of parallel walls: those\r\nextending towards the south have been traced for nearly two miles,\r\nand finally lose themselves in the plain; the remaining parallels\r\nterminate as shown in the plan. They are upwards of a mile in length.\r\nThe walls composing these singular lines are placed about two hundred\r\nfeet apart, and are parallel throughout. A singular feature occurs in\r\nthe northern one, which is exhibited by the transverse section «g h».\r\nFor the space of a quarter of a mile, advantage is taken of a slight\r\nnatural ridge to construct between the walls a broad embankment,\r\nsomething higher than the parallels themselves. It is broad enough\r\nto permit fifty persons to walk abreast. A similar peculiarity is\r\nobserved in the short parallel leading from the square enclosure\r\ntowards the great circle E, and is exhibited by the section «i l».\r\nA feature somewhat analogous occurs within the parallels extending\r\nfrom the irregular works on the extreme right of the plan. This\r\nparallel is carried down the bank of the third terrace, which is\r\nhere fifteen or twenty feet high. Within the lines, the bank is cut\r\ndown, and regularly graded to an easy ascent. The pathway or road,\r\nfor a portion of its extent upon the alluvions, is elevated above\r\nthe walls, as shown in longitudinal section «m n». A similar grade\r\nis constructed at the extremity of the northern parallel, where the\r\nnatural bank is much higher than at any other point. Here the bank is\r\nexcavated inwardly, for upwards of one hundred and fifty feet; and\r\na portion of the earth is appropriated to form an elevated way over\r\nthe low swampy ground immediately at the foot of the terrace. These\r\nexcavations constitute quite imposing features, when viewed on the\r\nspot, but are hardly distinguishable upon the plan.\r\n\r\nA number of small circles are found connected with the works, and are\r\nchiefly embraced in the area between the two principal parallels.\r\nThey are about eighty feet in diameter, without gateways opening into\r\nthem; and it has been suggested that they probably mark the sites of\r\nancient circular dwellings. The circles indicated by the letter G are\r\nof much larger dimensions, and are characterized by ditches interior\r\nto their walls. They each have a diameter of about two hundred\r\n[p071] feet, and have elevated embankments constructed interior to\r\nthe ditch, as seen in the plan. This peculiarity has been already\r\nremarked, in some of the works of the Scioto valley.\r\n\r\nUpon the lower terraces, towards the point of junction between the\r\nSouth and Raccoon forks, a great number of mounds of various sizes\r\nare situated. Some are large, but for the most part they are small.\r\nA small truncated pyramid once existed here, but the construction of\r\nthe Ohio canal, and the subsequent establishment of the village of\r\nLockport at this point, have obliterated this as well as numerous\r\nother mounds. Indeed, these causes have resulted in the almost total\r\ndestruction of the singular maze of embankments, which communicates\r\ndirectly with the square enclosure. The ancient lines can now be\r\ntraced only at intervals, among gardens and outhouses. At the period\r\nwhen the original survey, upon which this plan is constructed, was\r\nmade, which is twelve years ago, the lines could all be made out. A\r\nfew years hence, the residents upon the spot will be compelled to\r\nresort to this map, to ascertain the character of the works which\r\noccupied the very ground upon which they stand.\r\n\r\nWithin the area partially enclosed by this series of works, was\r\nformerly a large natural pond, covering upwards of one hundred\r\nacres. It has been drained, so that the greater portion is under\r\ncultivation. Previous to the earthquake of 1811, which resulted\r\nin the destruction of New Madrid on the Mississippi, it is said\r\nbut little water was contained in the basin; after that event it\r\nrose to the depth of ten feet, and retained that level until the\r\ndrainage took place. It has been suggested that it owed its origin to\r\nartificial excavation; but it is incontestably natural, like several\r\nother smaller depressions in the vicinity, which still contain water.\r\nExcavations, denominated “wells,” from which the materials for the\r\nconstruction of the wall were taken, are abundant in the neighborhood\r\nof these works.\r\n\r\nSeveral extraordinary coincidences are exhibited between the details\r\nof these works and some of those already described. The smaller\r\ncircle F is nearly identical in size with that belonging to the\r\n“Hopeton Works,” and with the one attached to the octagon, in the\r\n“High Bank” group. (See Plates XVI and XVII.) The works last named\r\nare situated upon the Scioto, seventy miles distant. The square has\r\nalso the same area with the rectangle belonging to the Hopeton, and\r\nwith the octagon attached to the High Bank Works. The octagon, too,\r\nhas the same area with the large, irregular square at Marietta. The\r\nsmall circles G, G, G, betray a coincidence with those in connection\r\nwith the works above mentioned, which ought not to be overlooked. It\r\nis not to be supposed that these numerous coincidences are the result\r\nof accident.\r\n\r\nIt would be unprofitable to indulge in speculations as to the\r\nprobable origin and purposes of this group of works. That it could\r\nnot have been designed for defence, seems too obvious to admit of\r\ndoubt.[55] The reasons urged against the [p072] hypothesis of a\r\ndefensive origin in the Marietta works apply with double force here.\r\nThe structure which, from the height and solidity of its walls,\r\nwould seem best adapted for defence, has its ditch «interior» to\r\nthe embankment,—a blunder which no people possessing the skill and\r\njudgment displayed in the defensive works of the mound-builders,\r\nwould be apt to commit.[56]\r\n\r\nHill works, incontestibly of a defensive origin, occur within four\r\nor five miles of this group, the relative positions of which are\r\nindicated by the “«Map of six miles of the Newark Valley».” About\r\nfour miles distant, and overlooking those works, is placed, upon the\r\nsummit of a high hill, a gigantic effigy of some animal, probably\r\nthe alligator. Of this remarkable structure a plan is presented on a\r\nsubsequent page. Around these works, in the valley and crowning the\r\nhills bordering it, are numerous mounds, all of which, as compared\r\nwith those of the Scioto, are singularly broad and flat. Many of\r\nthem have been opened, but no account has been preserved of their\r\ncharacter. So far as could be ascertained from diligent inquiry,\r\nthey do not essentially differ in their contents from those found\r\nelsewhere in the State. Fifteen or twenty miles to the northward of\r\nthese works, are others of an interesting character, which have never\r\nbeen investigated, and of which no public notice has yet been taken.\r\n[p073]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVI. Marietta Works, Washington Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXVI.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS AT MARIETTA, OHIO.[57]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable group of works was among the earliest noticed by\r\nWestern explorers. It was described by Harte as early as 1791; and\r\na further account was presented in “Harris’s Tour,” published in\r\n1805, in which an imperfect birds-eye view was also given. Since that\r\nperiod various descriptions have appeared in print; and a number of\r\nplans, differing materially in their details, have been published.\r\nIt is of so much importance, however, and has been the basis of so\r\nmuch speculation, that it is time an «accurate» map and a careful\r\ndescription should be placed before the public. Such a map and such a\r\ndescription it is here aimed to present.\r\n\r\nThe works occupy the high, sandy plain, at the junction of the\r\nMuskingum and Ohio rivers. This plain is from eighty to one hundred\r\nfeet above the bed of the river, and from forty to sixty above the\r\nbottom lands of the Muskingum. Its outlines are shown on the map. It\r\nis about three fourths of a mile long, by half a mile in width; is\r\nbounded on the side next the hills by ravines, formed by streams,\r\nand terminates on the side next the river in an abrupt bank, resting\r\nupon the recent alluvions. The topography of the plain and adjacent\r\ncountry is minutely represented on this map.\r\n\r\nThe works consist of two irregular squares, (one containing forty\r\nacres area, the other about twenty acres,) in connection with a\r\ngraded or covered way and sundry mounds and truncated pyramids,\r\nthe relative positions of which are shown in the plan. The town\r\nof Marietta is laid out over them; and, in the progress of\r\nimprovement, the walls have been considerably reduced and otherwise\r\nmuch obliterated; yet the outlines of the entire works may still\r\nbe traced. The walls of the principal square, where they remain\r\nundisturbed, are now between five and six feet high by twenty or\r\nthirty feet base; those of the smaller enclosure are somewhat less.\r\nThe entrances or gateways at the sides of the latter are each covered\r\nby a small mound placed interior to the embankment; at the corners\r\nthe gateways are in line with it. The larger work is destitute of\r\nthis feature, unless we class as such an interior crescent wall\r\ncovering the entrance at its southern angle. [p074]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nWithin the larger enclosure are four elevated squares or truncated\r\npyramids of earth, which, from their resemblance to similar erections\r\nin Mexico and Central America, merit a particular notice.[58] Three\r\nof these have graded passages or avenues of ascent to their tops. The\r\nprincipal one is marked A in the plan, and an engraving more clearly\r\nillustrating its features is herewith presented, Fig. 17. It is one\r\nhundred and eighty-eight feet long by one hundred and thirty-two\r\nwide, and ten high. Midway upon each of its sides are graded ascents,\r\nrendering easy the passage to its top. These grades are twenty-five\r\nfeet wide and sixty feet long. The next in size is marked B in the\r\nplan, and is one hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and\r\ntwenty wide, and eight feet high. It has three graded passages to\r\nits top, viz. upon the north, west, and east. Those at the sides\r\nare placed somewhat to the north of the centre of the elevation.\r\nUpon the south side there is a recess or hollow way, instead of a\r\nglacis, fifty feet long by twenty wide. This elevation is placed upon\r\nan easy swell or ridge of land, and occupies the most conspicuous\r\nposition within the enclosure, every part of which is commanded\r\nfrom its summit. A few feet distant from the northern glacis, is a\r\nsmall conical mound, surrounded with shallow excavations, from which\r\nthe earth for its construction, and, perhaps, for the construction\r\nin part of the pyramidal structure, was taken. To the right of the\r\nelevation, and near the eastern angle of the enclosure, is a smaller\r\nelevation one hundred and twenty feet long, fifty broad, and six feet\r\nhigh. It had graded ascents at its ends, similar in all respects to\r\nthose just described. It is now much obliterated. Near the northern\r\nangle of the work is another elevation, not distinctly marked. The\r\ntwo larger squares are covered with a close turf, and still preserve\r\ntheir symmetry. Indeed, no erections of earth alone could surpass\r\nthem in regularity. They are perfectly level on the top, except where\r\nsome uprooted tree has displaced the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage or gateway one hundred and fifty feet wide, in\r\nthe middle of the left wall of this enclosure, on the side next the\r\nMuskingum. Leading from it towards the river, and at right angles to\r\nthe embankment, is the “«Sacra Via»,” a «graded» or «covered way»\r\nof singular construction. It is six hundred and eighty feet long by\r\none hundred and fifty wide between the banks, and consists of an\r\nexcavated passage descending regularly from the plain, upon which the\r\nworks just described are situated, to the alluvions of the river.\r\nThe earth, in part at least, is thrown outward upon either side,\r\nforming embankments from eight to ten feet in height. The centre of\r\nthe excavated way is slightly raised and rounded, after the manner of\r\nthe paved streets of modern cities. The cross section «g h» exhibits\r\nthis feature. [p075] This section is constructed from measurements\r\ntaken at a point midway between the top and base of the grade.\r\nMeasured between the summits of the banks, the width of the way is\r\ntwo hundred and thirty feet. At the base of the grade, the walls upon\r\nthe interior are twenty feet high. From this point there is a slight\r\ndescent, for the distance of several hundred feet, to the bank of the\r\nriver, which is here thirty-five or forty feet in height. It has been\r\nconjectured by some, that the river flowed immediately at the foot\r\nof this way at the time of its construction. This is, however, mere\r\nconjecture, unsupported by evidence. If admitted, it would give to\r\nthis monument an antiquity greatly superior to that of the pyramids,\r\nunless the deepening of our river channels has been infinitely\r\nmore rapid in times past, than at present. But one fact favors the\r\nconjecture, and that is the entire absence of remains of antiquity\r\nupon the beautiful terraces to which this graded passage leads. They\r\nmay nevertheless have been once as thickly populated as they now are;\r\nand this passage may have been the grand avenue leading to the sacred\r\nplain above, through which assemblies and processions passed, in the\r\nsolemn observances of a mysterious worship.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the smaller enclosure is a finely formed truncated\r\nmound, (a view of which is given in a subsequent Plate,) thirty\r\nfeet high, and surrounded by a circular wall, constituting a\r\nperfect ellipse, the transverse and conjugate diameters of which\r\nare two hundred and thirty feet, and two hundred and fifteen feet\r\nrespectively.[59] This beautiful monument is now enclosed in the\r\npublic cemetery, and is carefully guarded from encroachment. A flight\r\nof steps ascends to its summit, on which seats are disposed, and from\r\nwhich a beautiful prospect is commanded.[60] In the vicinity occur\r\nseveral fragmentary walls, as shown in the map. [p076]\r\n\r\nExcavations, or “dug holes,” are observable at various points around\r\nthese works. Near the great mound are several of considerable size.\r\nThose indicated by «m» and «n» in the plan have been regarded and\r\ndescribed as «wells». Their regularity and former depth are the\r\nonly reasons adduced in support of this belief. The circumstance\r\nof regularity is not at all remarkable, and is a common feature in\r\nexcavations manifestly made for the purpose of procuring material\r\nfor the construction of mounds, etc. Their present depth is small,\r\nthough it is represented to have been formerly much greater. There\r\nis some reason for believing that they were dug in order to procure\r\nclay for the construction of pottery and for other purposes, inasmuch\r\nas a very fine variety of that material occurs at this point, some\r\ndistance below the surface. The surface soil has recently been\r\nremoved, and the manufacture of bricks commenced. The “clay lining”\r\nwhich has been mentioned as characterizing these “wells,” is easily\r\naccounted for, by the fact that they are sunk in a clay bank!\r\n\r\nUpon the opposite side of the Muskingum river are bold, precipitous\r\nbluffs, several hundred feet in height. Along their brows are a\r\nnumber of small stone mounds. They command an extensive view, and\r\noverlook the entire plain upon which the works here described are\r\nsituated.[61]\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal facts connected with these interesting\r\nremains. The generally received opinion respecting them is, that they\r\nwere erected for defensive purposes. Such was the belief of the late\r\nPresident HARRISON, who visited them in person, and whose opinion, in\r\nmatters of this kind, is entitled to great weight. The reasons for\r\nthis belief have never been presented, and they are not very obvious.\r\nThe number and width of the gateways, the absence of a fosse, as well\r\nas the character of the enclosed and accompanying remains, present\r\nstrong objections to the hypothesis which ascribes to them a warlike\r\norigin. And it may here be remarked, that the conjecture that the\r\nMuskingum ran at the base of the graded way already described, at\r\nthe period of its erection, seems to have had its origin in the\r\nassumption of a military design in the entire group. Under this\r\nhypothesis, it was supposed that the way was designed to cover or\r\nsecure access to the river,—an object which it would certainly not\r\nhave required the construction of a passage-way one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet wide to effect. The elevated squares were never designed for\r\nmilitary purposes,—their very regularity of structure forbids the\r\nconclusion. They were most likely erected as the sites for structures\r\nwhich have long since passed away, or for the celebration of unknown\r\nrites,—corresponding in short, in purpose as they do in form, with\r\nthose which they so much resemble in [p077] Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica. Do not these enclosed structures give us the clue to the\r\npurposes of the works with which they are connected? As heretofore\r\nremarked, the sacred grounds of almost every people are set apart or\r\ndesignated by enclosures of some kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVII. Portsmouth Works, at the mouth of the Scioto\r\nriver.]\r\n\r\nThe absolute identity in size between the smaller enclosure, (which\r\nvaries a little from a true square,) and several of those which\r\noccur in the Scioto valley, should not be overlooked, in any attempt\r\nto educe the character and design of the group. That there is some\r\nsignificance in the fact is obvious. (See Plates XVI and XVII.)\r\nThere are no other works in the immediate vicinity of Marietta. At\r\nParkersburgh, Virginia, on the Ohio, twelve miles below, there is an\r\nenclosure of irregular form and considerable extent, a miniature plan\r\nof which, from the MSS. of Prof. Rafinesque, is herewith presented,\r\nFig. 18. There are also some works at Belpre, opposite Parkersburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Muskingum is for the most part narrow, affording\r\nfew of those broad, level, and fertile terraces, which appear to have\r\nbeen the especial favorites of the race of mound-builders, and upon\r\nwhich most of their monuments are found. As a consequence, we find\r\nfew remains of magnitude in that valley, until it assumes a different\r\naspect, in the vicinity of Zanesville, ninety miles from its mouth,\r\nwhere the interesting remains figured in the preceding Plate are\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXVII.\r\n THE PORTSMOUTH WORKS, SCIOTO COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful plain at the confluence of the Scioto and Ohio rivers,\r\nwhere now the flourishing town of Portsmouth is located, forms the\r\nsite of a singular and interesting series of works. It has been\r\npreferred to present them together, as they seem to be intimately\r\nconnected, leaving the reader to form his own conclusions respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe works consist of three divisions or groups, extending for eight\r\nmiles along the Ohio river, and are connected by parallel lines\r\nof embankments. Two of these groups are on the Kentucky side of\r\nthe river; the remaining one, together with the larger portion of\r\nthe connecting embankment, on the Ohio shore. A reference to the\r\naccompanying map, exhibiting a section of eight miles of the Ohio\r\nvalley, will show the relative positions and general plan, though not\r\nthe exact proportions of the series. The avenues or “covered ways,”\r\nextending from one work to the other, have induced many persons to\r\nassign them a military origin, and a design to protect communication\r\nbetween the groups. But unless the work at A be regarded as a work\r\nof defence, it is very certain that we must seek for some other\r\nexplanation of their purposes. These avenues constitute a [p078]\r\nremarkable feature; and as enlarged plans and full descriptions\r\nof the several groups follow, it may be well to notice them more\r\nparticularly here. It will be seen that from the central group B,\r\nthree lines lead off: one to the south-east, to a point on the Ohio,\r\nnearly opposite to which, on the Kentucky side, it is resumed,\r\nleading to the circular work C; another bears south-west, to a point\r\non the river, nearly opposite the large and regular work A. It does\r\nnot appear to be resumed on the other side of the river. A third\r\nline runs north-west for a considerable distance, and loses itself\r\nin the broken grounds towards the Scioto. It may have communicated\r\nwith other works in that direction, which have been obliterated\r\nby time, or, which is most likely, were destroyed in the manifest\r\nchanges which the plain in that direction has undergone within a few\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThese lines consist of parallel embankments of earth, now measuring\r\nabout four feet in height, by twenty feet base. They are not far from\r\none hundred and sixty feet apart. The line leading towards the mouth\r\nof the Scioto, however, at about midway of the distance, suddenly\r\ncontracts to seventy feet. It is said to have as suddenly widened\r\nfurther on, enclosing a square area, with a gateway opening to the\r\nnorth. The town of Portsmouth is built over this portion, and all\r\ntraces of the parallelogram and the walls have disappeared. Near the\r\npoint of contraction in this line are two or three mounds of medium\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact to be observed in these as in similar lines at other\r\nplaces, that they are not interrupted by the inequalities of the\r\nground, but conform to the undulations of the surface, running\r\nsometimes at right angles to the terrace banks, and sometimes\r\ndiagonally up and down them. At some points these banks are very\r\nsteep,—so steep, indeed, that in clambering up them the explorer is\r\ninclined to doubt that they were ever used or intended for purposes\r\nof communication. The only interruptions are those caused by the\r\npassage of streams, there being no gateways observable. The total\r\nlength of the parallels now traceable may be estimated at eight\r\nmiles, giving «sixteen miles» of embankment to the parallels alone.\r\nIf we include the walls of the entire series, we have a grand total\r\nof upwards of «twenty» miles.\r\n\r\nAfter this general view, the reader will be prepared to examine\r\nthe groups forming the series A, B, and C, in the order of their\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXVIII.\r\n PORTSMOUTH WORKS—GROUP A.\r\n\r\nThe singular work, a plan of which is here given, occurs on the\r\nKentucky side of the Ohio river, opposite the old mouth of the\r\nScioto, about two miles below the town of Portsmouth. The terrace\r\non which it is situated is elevated some fifty feet above the first\r\nbottom, and extends back to the hills, which at this point [p079]\r\nare at some distance from the river. It is much cut up by ravines,\r\nand is quite uneven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVIII. Portsmouth Works.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Group A.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Group B.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Group C.]\r\n\r\nThe main body of the work is situated upon a very beautiful level,\r\nsomewhat ascending to the east. The wings are on equally beautiful\r\nlevels, except that they are broken at two or three points by ravines.\r\n\r\nThe principal work is an exact rectangle, eight hundred feet square.\r\nThe walls are about twelve feet high, by thirty-five or forty feet\r\nbase, except on the east, where advantage is taken of the rise of\r\nground, so as to elevate them about fifty feet above the centre of\r\nthe area. This feature is exhibited in the section «a b».\r\n\r\nThe hollow way between the south-eastern wall and the terrace bank\r\nbeyond seems artificial,—at any rate, it has been modified by art.\r\nThe gateway on this side is entered by a slightly elevated causeway.\r\nAt the southern angle is a bastion, probably natural but adapted by\r\nart, which commands the hollow way or ditch. The wall at this part\r\nis distinctly marked, but not more than three feet high. On the\r\nsouth-western side is a sort of runway, resembling a ditch, which\r\nloses itself in a deep gully towards the river. It is undoubtedly\r\nwholly or in part artificial. There are no traces of ditches\r\nelsewhere about the work. A narrow gateway thirty feet wide opens in\r\nthe middle of each side, and at the northern and western angles, as\r\nrepresented in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe most singular features of this structure are its outworks, which\r\nconsist of parallel walls leading to the north-east and south-west.\r\nThey are exactly parallel to the sides of the main work, and are\r\neach two thousand one hundred feet long. Some measurements make them\r\nof unequal lengths; but after a careful calculation of the space\r\noccupied by the interrupting ravines, they are found to be very\r\nnearly, not exactly, of the same length.\r\n\r\nThe parallel to the south-west has its outer wall in line with the\r\nnorth-western wall of the main work, and starts at thirty feet\r\ndistance from the same. It is broken by a deep ravine near its\r\nextremity, which is probably four or five hundred feet wide. Crossing\r\nthe ravine, the walls, traces of which are seen on the declivity,\r\ncontinue to some distance, and then curve on a radius of one hundred\r\nfeet, leaving a narrow gateway eight feet wide in the centre.\r\nConverging walls start from the point of curve, but lose themselves\r\nafter running three hundred feet, without meeting. Just beyond and a\r\nlittle to the right, on the plain, are two clay mounds, also a small\r\ncircle one hundred feet in diameter, the walls of which are two feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe parallel to the north-east starts from the centre (nearly) of the\r\nmain work, and is similar to the one already described, save that it\r\nis not terminated by converging walls, and has no mounds beyond. It\r\nis interrupted by two ravines, the walls running to their very edges.\r\nThe left wall of the parallel bends to a right angle as it approaches\r\nthe main work.\r\n\r\nTo the left of this parallel, four hundred and fifty feet from a\r\npoint eight hundred feet distant from the main work, on a high\r\npeninsula or headland, is a singular redoubt, an enlarged view of\r\nwhich is given in the supplementary plan N. To the left of it is\r\nthe bank of the second bottom, fifty feet high, and very steep. To\r\nthe right is the hollow of a small stream with steep banks. The\r\nembankment of this work is heavy, and the ditch deep and wide, and\r\ninterior to the wall. From [p080] the bottom of the ditch to the top\r\nof the wall, is perhaps twelve or fifteen feet. The enclosed oval\r\narea is only sixty feet wide by one hundred and ten long. It has a\r\ngateway to the north-east ten feet wide,—outside of which, in the\r\ndeep forest, is the grave of one of the first settlers. The object of\r\nthis enclosure it is difficult to divine. If a place of burial, as\r\nhas been suggested, properly conducted excavations would disclose the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nA light wall of some hundred paces in extent runs from the left hand\r\nentrance of the main work, along the verge of a declivity terminating\r\nat the western angle. On this side are also three mounds, each about\r\nsix feet high,—formerly much higher, having been greatly reduced\r\nby the plough. From the western angle a deep gully runs off to the\r\nriver; it has been mistaken by some for a covered way.\r\n\r\nThe entire main work, the greater part of the lower parallel, and a\r\nportion of the upper one, are now in open cultivated grounds. The\r\nwalls of the main work are so steep as to preclude cultivation, and\r\nnow form the fence lines of the area, which is fifteen acres. The\r\narea of the parallels is ten acres each;—total, thirty-five acres.\r\n\r\nBetween this work and the river are traces of a modern Indian\r\nencampment or town,—shells, burned stones, fragments of rude pottery,\r\netc., also some graves. This was a favorite spot with the Indians,\r\nfor various reasons, one of which is its proximity to a noted saline\r\nspring or deer lick, known as “McArthur’s Lick.”\r\n\r\nFrom the size of the walls, their position, and other circumstances,\r\nit has been supposed that this was a fortified place. If palisaded,\r\nit would certainly be impregnable to any savage attack. If designed\r\nas a sacred place, its sloping area would be most fit for the\r\nobservance of sacrifices or ceremonies.\r\n\r\nWhat may have been the purpose of the mysterious parallels, is more\r\nthan we, at this period, can venture to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXVIII.\r\n PORTSMOUTH WORKS—GROUP B.\r\n\r\nThis group also occupies the third terrace, and, though not so\r\nimposing in magnitude as the one just described, seems to be the\r\ngrand centre from which the parallel lines, characterizing this\r\nseries of works, radiate. Its details are intricate, and can\r\nonly be understood by the aid of the plan. The two crescent or\r\nhorse-shoe-shaped walls constitute the first striking feature which\r\npresents itself. They are both of about the same size and shape,\r\nmeasuring eighty feet in length by seventy in breadth. The earth\r\naround them appears to have been considerably excavated. Enclosing\r\nthese in part is a circular wall now about five feet high. The\r\nelevation to the right appears to be natural, although evidently\r\nmuch modified by art. It is eighteen feet high at the end next the\r\nprincipal division of the work, but gradually [p081] subsides into\r\na low ridge towards the enclosed mound «a b». A full view of the\r\nentire group may be had from its summit. The mound just mentioned is\r\ntwenty-eight feet high, by one hundred and ten base; it is truncated\r\nand surrounded by a low circumvallation. There are several small\r\ncircles, measuring from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and\r\nfifty feet in diameter; also a few mounds, in the positions indicated\r\nin the plan.\r\n\r\nNo one, after examining its details, would be apt to ascribe a\r\nmilitary origin to this group. The most reasonable conjecture\r\nrespecting it is, that it was in some way connected with the\r\nsuperstitions of the builders; in what manner, of course, it is\r\nimpossible to determine. A thorough examination of the mounds might\r\nthrow some light on the question. At any rate, it is entirely unique\r\nin many of its features, and furnishes an interesting study for the\r\nantiquary.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXVIII.\r\n PORTSMOUTH WORKS—GROUP C.\r\n\r\nThis group is on the Kentucky shore, and principally occupies the\r\nthird terrace, or high level at the base of the hills bordering the\r\nvalley. The ground is here considerably broken. The northern portion\r\nof the work is somewhat lower than the remainder, and a small brook\r\ncuts through the outer wall on the south. This work is in many\r\nrespects novel, and for this reason, as well as from the connection\r\nin which it is found, is entitled to an attention not otherwise\r\nmerited; for no person looking merely for what is striking from\r\nposition, or imposing from magnitude, would be apt to pay it a second\r\nvisit. It consists of four concentric circles, placed at irregular\r\nintervals in respect to each other, and cut at right angles by four\r\nbroad avenues, which conform in bearing very nearly to the cardinal\r\npoints. A large mound is placed in the centre; it is truncated and\r\nterraced, and has a graded way leading to its summit. A reference to\r\nthe plan and sections will exhibit in one view the dimensions and\r\ngeneral aspect of the work, obviating the necessity of a detailed\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe mound in the centre, at first glance, would be taken for a\r\nnatural elevation; and it is possible that it is a detached spur of\r\na hill, modified and perhaps enlarged by art. A hillock in such a\r\nposition is, however, a circumstance of very rare occurrence. From\r\nthe level summit of this mound, a complete view of every part of\r\nthe surrounding work is commanded. Were it not for the obstructing\r\nforests, it is believed the eye might obtain, from this position,\r\na view of the river and intermediate plain, as also of the works\r\nbeyond, and several miles distant. On the supposition that this work\r\nwas in some way connected with the religious rites and ceremonies of\r\nthe builders, this mound must have afforded a most conspicuous place\r\nfor their observance and celebration. And it is easy, while standing\r\non its [p082] summit, to people it with the strange priesthood of\r\nancient superstition, and fill its avenues and line its walls with\r\nthe thronging devotees of a mysterious worship. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the divinity of their belief, order, symmetry, and design were\r\namong his attributes; if, as appears most likely, the works that most\r\nstrongly exhibit these features were dedicated to religious purposes,\r\nand were symbolical in their design.\r\n\r\nAbout one mile to the west of this work are a number of mounds, some\r\nof considerable size, and also a small circular work, D, of exquisite\r\nsymmetry and proportion. It consists of an embankment of earth five\r\nfeet high by thirty feet base, with an interior ditch twenty-five\r\nfeet across by six feet deep, enclosing an area ninety feet in\r\ndiameter, in the centre of which rises a mound eight feet high by\r\nforty feet base. A narrow gateway through the parapet, and a causeway\r\nover the ditch, lead to the enclosed mound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—CIRCLE AND MOUND, GREENUP COUNTY, KENTUCKY.]\r\n\r\nThe above view, taken on the spot, will illustrate the appearance of\r\nthis class of works. Nothing can exceed their regularity and beauty,\r\nwhen clothed with turf or covered with forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIX. No. 1.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, MONTGOMERY COUNTY, OHIO.[62]\r\n\r\nThese works are situated on the east bank of the Great Miami river,\r\nsix miles below Dayton, Montgomery county, Ohio. They are built upon\r\nthe second bottom or terrace, which is here nearly a mile broad,\r\nand elevated about twenty feet above the river. The plan of the\r\ngroup coincides very nearly with that of some of the [p083] more\r\nregular works of the Scioto valley. (See Plates XX and XXI.) It seems\r\nnever to have been completed; at any rate, the various parts were\r\nnever connected. A portion of the great circle A has been washed\r\naway by the river, which here encroaches upon the second terrace.\r\nThe diameter of this circle is one hundred feet greater than that\r\nof the corresponding large circle of the Scioto works; and the same\r\nproportionate increase in size is to be observed in the square and\r\nlower circle. The embankments are now between five and six feet high,\r\nand have a base fifty feet wide. They are composed of a tough, yellow\r\nclay, which is found to be superimposed on the loam of the original\r\nlevel. It must have been brought from a distance, as there are no\r\nexcavations perceptible in the vicinity. The embankments, as in the\r\ncase of several other works which have been noticed, appear to have\r\nbeen some time or other subjected to the action of fire. They are\r\nunaccompanied by a ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIX.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Ancient Works six miles below Dayton, Montgomery Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Ancient Work and Animal Effigy, Scioto Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Ancient Works near Worthington, Franklin Co., Ohio.]\r\n\r\nThe Miami canal extends through these works, and the little town of\r\nAlexandersville is laid out over a portion of the smaller circle. The\r\nclay composing the embankments is now much used in the manufacture\r\nof bricks, and but a little time will elapse before the work will be\r\nentirely obliterated.\r\n\r\nWe can only regard this structure as kindred in its purposes to those\r\nabove alluded to in the Scioto valley, and associate it with the\r\nsuperstitions of the builders. It tends to confirm the impression\r\nproduced by the other works, that some significance attaches to the\r\ncombination of the two circles and the square.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIX. No. 2.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, SCIOTO COUNTY, OHIO.[63]\r\n\r\nThis singular work is situated five miles north of Portsmouth, Scioto\r\ncounty, Ohio, on the west bank of the Scioto river. It is not a\r\ntrue ellipse, but approaches very near it. Its longest axis is four\r\nhundred and eighty feet, its conjugate diameter four hundred and\r\nseven feet. It is built upon a high and beautiful level, elevated\r\nsome sixty or seventy feet above the Scioto river, which flows about\r\nhalf a mile to the eastward. The embankment is unaccompanied by\r\na ditch, and is about three feet in height, by thirty feet base.\r\nIt has, as shown in the plan, a single gateway, ninety feet wide,\r\nopening to the south-east, which is covered by a long exterior mound,\r\nof about the same height with the embankment of the enclosure.\r\n\r\nWithin this enclosure is a large irregular mound, which, from its\r\nresemblance to the animal-shaped mounds of Wisconsin, of which notice\r\nwill be taken in [p084] another place, constitutes by far the most\r\ninteresting feature of the work. It is of the form and relative size\r\nindicated in the plan, and is composed of loose broken sandstone and\r\nearth, based upon dislocated and broken sand-rock. It is from one\r\nto eight feet high, being lowest at the eastern end or head, and at\r\nthe projecting points. It is probably of the same design with those\r\nof Wisconsin, already alluded to, which occur in great numbers and\r\nin long and apparently dependent ranges. None of those, however,\r\nso far as known, are found enclosed after the manner of the one\r\nhere presented. (See “«Remains of the North-West».”) No explanation\r\nof the probable design of this work will be attempted here: it is\r\nimpossible, however, to disconnect it from the superstitions of the\r\nancient people. An interesting fact is communicated by F. Cleveland,\r\nEsq., of Portsmouth, who assisted Mr. Whittlesey in making the survey\r\nof this work, and who was engineer on the Ohio canal when it was in\r\nprogress; viz. that the workmen engaged in excavating found large\r\nquantities of mica, in sheets, in the immediate vicinity of this\r\nenclosure. This mineral is found in great abundance in the mounds,\r\nand in the neighborhood of these ancient works.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXIX. No. 3.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, FRANKLIN COUNTY, OHIO.[64]\r\n\r\nThis work occurs on the banks of Olentangy creek, a tributary of\r\nthe Scioto river, about one mile west of the town of Worthington,\r\nFranklin county, Ohio. The plateau upon the edge of which it is\r\nsituated is elevated about fifty feet above the bottoms of the\r\nOlentangy, and consists of a clayey soil resting on the black shale\r\nformation of Ohio. The work is rectangular in form; its sides\r\ncorrespond very nearly with the cardinal points, (varying but five\r\ndegrees,) and measure six hundred and thirty, and five hundred and\r\nfifty feet respectively. The walls are unaccompanied by a ditch, and\r\nare very slight, though distinctly traceable. In the line of the\r\nsouthern wall is a large truncated mound, C, twenty feet in height,\r\nand measuring one hundred and ninety-two feet in diameter at the\r\nbase, and seventy-six feet in diameter at the summit. It is covered\r\nwith large trees. The wall that leads from this mound to the left,\r\nis placed a little further outwards than that leading to the right.\r\nThe mound D, in the centre of the enclosure, is small and low. Near\r\nthe south-western corner of the work is a small circle, with an\r\ninterior ditch and single entrance; it is one hundred and twenty feet\r\nin diameter. Some distance to the north-west of the enclosure, and\r\non the opposite side of a deep ravine, is another small circle, one\r\nhundred and forty feet in diameter, with three entrances. [p085]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXX. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Butler Co. Ohio\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Butler Co. Ohio\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Near Bourneville, Ross Co. Ohio\r\n\r\nNo. 4. On Black Run, Ross Co. Ohio]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXX. No. 1.[65]\r\n\r\nThis work is situated four miles south-west of the town of Hamilton,\r\nButler county, Ohio, on S. 10, T. 1, R. 2, between the Great and\r\nLittle Miami rivers. It is indicated by the letter C, in the Map of a\r\nsection of the Miami valley (Plate III, No. 2).\r\n\r\nThe ground upon which this unique work is built is the level bottom\r\nof the Miami river, at a distance from any high lands. The principal\r\nor square portion of the work is constructed of an embankment of\r\nearth, about four feet high by fifty feet base, unaccompanied by a\r\nditch. The walls of the circular or irregular portion of the work,\r\ntowards Pleasant run, are considerably heavier, and have an interior\r\nditch. The work is not an exact square, nor are its gateways disposed\r\nwith the usual degree of regularity. The walls, at the western angle,\r\nterminate in a large oblong mound, and a small mound occupies the\r\ncentre of one of the attached circular works.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the enclosure, towards the south, are two\r\nlarge mounds, placed one hundred and thirty-five feet apart. They are\r\neach about two hundred and fifty feet in circumference, and fifteen\r\nfeet in perpendicular height, and are in part composed of large\r\nstones. These mounds, as also the larger portion of the enclosure,\r\nare situated in timbered land, the forests presenting the usual\r\nprimitive aspect. The trees growing upon the walls are of the largest\r\nsize, and are surrounded by the fallen and decayed trunks of their\r\npredecessors. From this work to the Miami river, the distance is now\r\nabout half a mile; the intervening bottom is low and of comparatively\r\nrecent formation. It is probable that the river once washed the work,\r\nat the point now bounded by Pleasant run.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which it is here unnecessary to recapitulate, this work\r\nis deemed of religious origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXX. No. 2.[66]\r\n\r\nThis work is indicated by the letter F, in the map of a section of\r\nthe Miami valley, and is situated on the right bank of the Miami\r\nriver, seven miles below the town of Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio,\r\non S. 27 and 34, T. 3, R. 2, E. M.\r\n\r\nLittle can be said respecting it, except that it is a circle of\r\nconsiderable size, [p086] bounded by an embankment, at present about\r\ntwo feet high, composed of earth taken up evenly from the surface,\r\nor brought from a distance. It has an entrance to the left, two\r\nhundred and seventy-five feet wide; the embankment upon either hand\r\nterminating in a small mound, between four and five feet high. The\r\narea of the enclosure is level, and covered with forest: the trees\r\nare, however, small, owing probably to the nature of the soil, which\r\nis thin and gravelly. The plain is here fifty feet above the adjacent\r\nbottoms.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile north-east of this work, on the opposite bank of Indian\r\ncreek, are three large mounds, on a line with each other. On the\r\nlower bottom or terrace, opposite to each mound, is a corresponding\r\nhole or excavation, from which the earth composing them was doubtless\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXX. No. 3.\r\n ANCIENT WORK NEAR BOURNEVILLE, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe small work here figured is one of the most beautiful in the State\r\nof Ohio. It is situated upon the highest terrace, directly facing,\r\nand about one mile distant from, the great stone hill-work of the\r\nPaint creek valley (Plate IV). It consists of a wall of earth, eight\r\nor ten feet in height, with a broad and shallow exterior ditch. In\r\nfigure it is elliptical, with a transverse diameter of seven hundred\r\nand fifty, and a conjugate diameter of six hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet. It has a gateway one hundred and twenty feet wide, leading into\r\nit from the south-west. It opens upon a small spur of the terrace,\r\nwhich has been artificially rounded and graded, so as to make a\r\nregular and easy descent to the lower level. Upon either side of\r\nthis grade, the banks of the terrace are steep and irregular. A very\r\ncopious spring of water starts from the bank near the wall, a little\r\nto the right of the entrance. A small circle and a couple of mounds\r\nare situated on the next lower terrace, at the points indicated in\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\nThis work is admirably preserved, and is remarkable as being the\r\nonly circular work at present known, which has its ditch exterior to\r\nthe walls. The proprietor esteems the soil much richer within the\r\nenclosure, than upon the adjacent plain. We are unprepared to ascribe\r\nany other than a religious origin to this structure. [p087]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXX. No. 4.\r\n STONE WORK ON “BLACK RUN,” ROSS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis unique work is situated in the little valley of “Black run,” a\r\nsmall tributary of Paint creek, and is distant about fifteen miles\r\nfrom Chillicothe. It is indicated by the letter E, in the “Map\r\nexhibiting a section of six miles of the Paint creek valley.” The\r\nwalls are composed of stones; but if ever regularly laid up, they\r\nare now thrown down, though not greatly scattered. The outlines are\r\nclearly defined, and can be exactly traced. The body of the work is\r\nelliptical in shape, its conjugate diameter being one hundred and\r\nseventy feet, its transverse two hundred and fifty feet. There is\r\na single opening or gateway, fifty feet wide, on the south, where\r\nthe walls curve outwards and lap back upon themselves for the space\r\nof sixty feet. The most remarkable feature of this singular work\r\nconsists of five walls, starting within ten feet of the unbroken\r\nline of the elliptical enclosure, and extending thence northward,\r\nslightly converging, for the distance of one hundred feet. The lines\r\nof the outer walls, if prolonged, would intersect each other at\r\nthe distance of two hundred and fifty feet. These walls are twenty\r\nfeet broad at the ends nearest the enclosure, and ten feet apart.\r\nThey diminish gradually, as they recede, to ten feet at their outer\r\nextremities. The western wall is nearly obliterated; the stones for\r\nthe construction of all the “cabin” hearths and chimneys in the\r\nneighborhood having been taken from this spot. The western portion of\r\nthe wall of the ellipse has also suffered from the same cause. The\r\namount of stone embraced in the outer walls is considerable, probably\r\nsufficient to construct walls of equal length, six feet broad and\r\neight feet high. They now exhibit but slight evidence of ever having\r\nbeen regularly laid up, and more resemble mounds of stones rudely\r\nthrown together. The stones have been removed from a section of the\r\ncentral wall, to the base; but we have been unable to ascertain that\r\nthe operation disclosed relics of any kind. The wall of the body of\r\nthe work appears considerably lighter than those last mentioned, and\r\nit is now quite impossible to determine whether it was ever regularly\r\nconstructed. The stones cover a space fifteen or twenty feet broad,\r\nand are irregularly heaped together to the height of perhaps three\r\nfeet. The work is overgrown with briers, bushes, and trees; which,\r\nwhen in leaf, completely hide its features from view, and render a\r\nsatisfactory examination impossible. In the autumn or spring, the\r\nentire outline of the work is distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of this strange work are entirely inexplicable: its\r\nsmall size precludes the idea of a defensive origin. It is the only\r\nstructure of the kind which has yet been discovered in the valleys,\r\nand it is totally unlike those found on the hills. The great “Stone\r\nFort” on Paint creek (Plate IV) is but two miles distant, and\r\noverlooks this work; both may be regarded as belonging to the same\r\nera, and as probably in some way connected with each other. [p088]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXI.\r\n GRADED WAY, NEAR PIKETON, PIKE COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThere is a singular class of earthworks, occurring at various\r\npoints at the West, which seem better to come up to the utilitarian\r\nstandard of our day than any other, and the purposes of which to the\r\npopular mind, if not to that of the antiquarian, seem very clear.\r\nThese are the «graded ways», ascending sometimes from one terrace\r\nto another, and occasionally descending towards the banks of rivers\r\nor water-courses. The one already described, in connection with the\r\nworks at Marietta, is of the latter description; as is also that at\r\nPiqua, Ohio, described by Maj. LONG.[67] One of the former character\r\noccurs near Richmondale, Ross county, Ohio; and another, and the most\r\nremarkable one, about one mile below Piketon, Pike county, in the\r\nsame State. A plan and view of the latter is herewith presented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 20.—VIEW OF GRADED WAY NEAR PIKETON OHIO.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a graded ascent from the second to the third terrace,\r\nthe level of which is here seventeen feet above that of the former.\r\nThe way is ten hundred and eighty feet long, by two hundred and\r\nfifteen feet wide at one extremity, and two hundred and three feet\r\nwide at the other, measured between the bases of the banks. [p089]\r\nThe earth is thrown outward on either hand, forming embankments\r\nvarying upon the outer sides from five to eleven feet in height;\r\nyet it appears that much more earth has been excavated than enters\r\ninto these walls. At the lower extremity of the grade, the walls\r\nupon the interior sides measure no less than «twenty-two» feet in\r\nperpendicular height. The easy ascent here afforded has been rendered\r\navailable in the construction of the Chillicothe and Portsmouth\r\nturnpike, which passes through it. The walls are covered with trees\r\nand bushes, and resemble parallel natural hills, and probably would\r\nbe regarded as such by the superficial observer. Indeed, hundreds\r\npass along without suspecting that they are in the midst of one of\r\nthe most interesting monuments which the country affords, and one\r\nwhich bears a marked resemblance to some of those works which are\r\ndescribed to us in connection with the causeways and aqueducts of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXI.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Graded-way Near Piketon, Pike Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Ancient Work Near Sommerville, Butler Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Ancient Work on Nine Mile Creek, Butler Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Ancient Work on Great Miami River, Butler Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the right-hand wall, upon the third terrace, extends\r\na low line of embankment, (now much obliterated by the construction\r\nof the turnpike,) two thousand five hundred and eighty feet long,\r\nleading towards a group of mounds, as shown in the plan. At the\r\ndistance of fifteen hundred feet from the grade, a wall starts off at\r\nright angles, for the distance of two hundred and twelve feet, when\r\nit assumes a course parallel to the principal line for four hundred\r\nand twenty feet, and then curves inwardly, terminating near a group\r\nconsisting of one large and three small mounds. A ground plan of the\r\nlatter is elsewhere given. This group of mounds is now enclosed,\r\nand constitutes the cemetery of the neighborhood. Forty rods to the\r\nright of this group, is a large mound thirty feet in height. Several\r\nsmall mounds occur upon the adjacent plain, though no enclosures of\r\nmagnitude are found nearer than five miles lower down, on the river.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand wall of the grade as we descend seems continued down\r\nupon the second terrace for some distance, terminating near a low\r\nspot of ground, usually containing water. Similar depressions are\r\nobserved in the ancient beds of streams. It has been suggested that\r\nthe Scioto river once flowed along the base of the terrace at this\r\npoint, and that the way led down to it. Without expressing an opinion\r\nupon the probability of this conjecture, it is sufficient to observe\r\nthat the river now flows more than half a mile to the left, and that\r\ntwo terraces, each twenty feet in height, intervene between the\r\npresent and the supposed ancient level of the stream. To assent to\r\nthe suggestion, would be to admit an almost immeasurable antiquity to\r\nthe structure under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, useless to speculate upon the probable purpose\r\nof this work. At first glance, it seems obvious; namely, that it\r\nwas constructed simply to facilitate the ascent from one terrace to\r\nanother. But the long line of embankment extending from it, and the\r\nmanifest connection which exists between it and the mounds upon the\r\nplain, unsettle this conclusion. After all, we are obliged to leave\r\nthis interesting work with the single remark, already several times\r\nmade in respect to others equally interesting and inexplicable, that\r\nfuture investigations, carefully conducted, may solve alike the\r\nproblem of their purposes and of their origin.[68] [p090]\r\n\r\nA singular work of art occurs on the top of a high hill, standing\r\nin the rear of the town of Piketon, and overlooking it, which it\r\nmay not be out of place to mention here. It consists of a perfectly\r\ncircular excavation, thirty feet in diameter, and twelve feet deep,\r\nterminating in a point at the bottom. It contains water for the\r\ngreater part of the year. A slight and regular wall is thrown up\r\naround its edge. A full and very distinct view of the graded way just\r\ndescribed is commanded from this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXI. Nos. 2, 3, and 4.\r\n\r\nThe works here presented possess few characteristics of works of\r\ndefence, and yet have little of the regularity, and but few of the\r\nfeatures, which distinguish the sacred enclosures.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2 is situated near Sommerville, Butler county, Ohio, on S.\r\n3 and 10, T. 5, R. 2, E. M. It occupies the second terrace between\r\nPleasant run and Seven Mile creek, and seems to have been encroached\r\nupon by both these streams. This terrace is about twenty-five feet\r\nhigher than the first terrace, and is bounded by steep banks. The\r\nwall of the work is about four feet high, the ditch of proportionate\r\ndepth. Near the centre is an exceedingly regular mound, one hundred\r\nfeet in diameter at the base, and thirteen feet in altitude. It is\r\nnow covered with a fine growth of maple-trees. At the north-east\r\ncorner of the work, in the embankment, there is a quantity of\r\nstones placed with some degree of regularity,—probably originally\r\nconstituting a sort of wall. At the opposite extremity of the work is\r\na dug hole or “well.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3 is situated nine miles north of the town of Hamilton, Butler\r\ncounty, Ohio, on a rich alluvial bottom, between Seven Mile and Nine\r\nMile creeks, the latter of which seems to have encroached upon the\r\nwork. The large oblong mound in the centre was partially excavated\r\nin constructing the Hamilton and Eaton turnpike. A quantity of bones\r\nwere discovered; but nothing is known of the position in which they\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 4 is situated on the east bank of the Great Miami river,\r\nfour miles below the town of Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio, and is\r\nindicated by the letter D, in the map of a section of the Miami\r\nvalley. Probably not more than half the original work now exists, the\r\nremainder having been destroyed by the encroachments of the river.\r\nThe wall and ditch are slight; the former not exceeding three feet in\r\nheight, and the latter two feet in depth. At the bank of the river,\r\nhowever, the original depth of the ditch, as also the amount of the\r\nvegetable and other matter with which it is filled up, are distinctly\r\nvisible. The ditch, which had been sunk into the [p091] gravel,\r\nwas originally five feet eight inches in depth; the accumulation\r\nsince its abandonment has been, therefore, three feet eight inches.\r\nAllowing the wall to have subsided to an equal extent, its original\r\nheight from the bottom of the trench must have been upwards of twelve\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXII.

Kentucky.]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the river encroaches upon its banks at this\r\npoint may be inferred from the fact, that twenty years previous to\r\nthe time of the survey of this work by Mr. McBride, in 1836, the\r\nriver flowed not far from three hundred feet to the left of the\r\ncentral mound, which since that time has entirely disappeared. About\r\nthirty feet below this mound was found, some years ago, a number of\r\nflat stories set on edge, forming a kind of coffin, in which was a\r\nhuman skeleton, accompanied by a large marine shell and some rude\r\nimplements. About a fourth of a mile below this work, appears to have\r\nbeen a general cemetery. The graves are indicated by small regular\r\nelevations.[69] The three works last described are laid down from\r\nthe surveys of Mr. MCBRIDE, from whose notes the above facts are\r\nprincipally derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\nUpon this plate are placed a number of small works, and groups of\r\nworks, arranged however with no view to any relationship, but as best\r\nserved the purposes of the engraver.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1 is a group of small works situated on a branch of Mill\r\ncreek, near the south-east corner of Butler county, Ohio, on S. 14,\r\nT. 3, R. 2, M. R. The rectangular work is two hundred and twenty feet\r\nlong, by one hundred and twenty feet broad. The walls are now about\r\nfive feet high, and are unaccompanied by a ditch. There were standing\r\nupon the embankment, in 1842, a red-oak tree three and a half feet in\r\ndiameter, and a white-oak tree three feet in diameter. Twenty rods\r\nnorth of this work is a truncated mound ten feet high; and a short\r\ndistance [p092] beyond it, rises a steep bank, fifty feet high,\r\nascending which we come to elevated ground. Here are the remains of\r\nanother small elliptical work, and some mounds. Upon the brow of the\r\nbank, at «a», is a pile of stones much burned, which is known in the\r\nvicinity as “«the furnace».” Immediately below, at the foot of the\r\nbank, is a copious spring. The survey of this group was made by Mr.\r\nMCBRIDE.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2 is situated near the town of Lowell, Washington county,\r\nOhio, and consists of a slight embankment of earth, of exceedingly\r\nregular outline. Little can be said of it, except that it is\r\naccompanied by eleven mounds; all of which are, however, exterior to\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3 is a group of small works, occupying the high lands on\r\nthe east side of the Scioto river, opposite Chillicothe. They are\r\nindicated by the letter L, in the map of a section of the Scioto\r\nValley (Plate II). They are introduced on a very small scale, so\r\nas to exhibit the dependence which seems to exist between them. Of\r\ncourse the relative size of the circles and mounds is considerably\r\nexaggerated. The mound numbered 1 occupies the most conspicuous\r\npoint in the valley; and from it is afforded the most extended view\r\nthat can be obtained in that entire region. Whether this fact can be\r\ntaken to establish its design as a beacon or observatory, it is not\r\npresumed to say. The mound numbered 2 is one of the finest known.\r\nIt is elliptical, one hundred and sixty feet long, sixty broad, and\r\nfifteen high. It has never been investigated. The remaining mounds,\r\n3, 4, 5, and 6, are all of large size. A fine view of the extensive\r\nancient works in the vicinity of Chillicothe must have been afforded\r\nfrom these elevated plains.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 4.—These works are included within the corporation limits\r\nof Chillicothe. They are already much obliterated, and will soon\r\nbe no longer traceable. They consist of a series of small circles,\r\nof uniform size, each two hundred and fifty feet in diameter. More\r\nextensive works formerly existed in connection with them, but have\r\nnow entirely disappeared. The mound represented in the plan is\r\nseventeen feet in height, and has what seems to be a graded ascent\r\nfrom the south. It has been excavated, and will be noticed at length\r\nelsewhere in this volume. The circles, it will be observed, appear to\r\nbe disposed with some degree of regularity in respect to each other.\r\nThe gateways of three of them open towards the east, that of the\r\nremaining one towards the south.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 5.—This unique little work is situated in the valley of Paint\r\ncreek, about one mile west of the village of Bainbridge, Ross county,\r\nOhio, on the turnpike leading from Chillicothe to Cincinnati. Its\r\ncharacter can only be understood from the plan. It affords but one\r\nof the thousand various combinations which the circular structures\r\nof the West assume. It can, of course, be regarded only as connected\r\nwith the superstitions of the builders, for the reason that it could\r\nanswer no good purpose for protection, nor subserve any of the [p093]\r\nuseful purposes for which enclosures are required, such as the\r\nlimits of fields and possessions, or the boundaries of villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXIII.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Ancient Works on Brush Creek, near Mount Sterling, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Ancient Work near Winchester, Indiana.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Map of a part of T. 20, R. 14, Randolph Co. Indiana.]\r\n\r\nNUMBER 6.—This work is situated near Mount Sterling, Montgomery\r\ncounty, Kentucky; and consists of a large truncated mound,\r\ntwenty-five feet in height, flanked on the north and west by narrow\r\ngrades or slopes. It is connected with a circular work, three hundred\r\nand fifty feet in diameter, by an elevated way or terrace, one\r\nhundred feet long. The circle has a small mound in its centre, and\r\na gateway opening to the east. Three small mounds occur in close\r\nconnection with it. The plan is from the RAFINESQUE MSS.\r\n\r\nLest these comparatively little works should appear insignificant,\r\nfrom the small scale on which they are presented, it may be well\r\nenough to remark, that the circle formed by the stones composing the\r\ngreat temple of Stonehenge is but a little more than one hundred feet\r\nin diameter, and that most of the circular earth and stone structures\r\nof the British islands are considerably less in size than those here\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIII. No. 1.[70]\r\n\r\nThis group of ancient works is situated on the west side of Brush\r\ncreek, six miles south-east of Mount Sterling, Montgomery county,\r\nKentucky. The work indicated by the letter A is one hundred feet\r\nsquare, and is composed of a slight embankment, with an interior\r\nditch. There is an entrance from the east. The elliptical mound C is\r\nabout two hundred yards distant from A, towards the east. It is nine\r\nfeet high, two hundred and seventy feet in circumference, truncated,\r\nand surmounted by a smaller conical mound. Another small mound is\r\nconnected with it, as shown in the plan. B is a circular work, five\r\nhundred and ten feet in circumference, with a ditch interior to the\r\nwall, and a gateway opening towards the east. The unexcavated ground\r\nin the interior is square in form, exhibiting an entire identity in\r\nthis feature with various works in Ohio. (See Plates XXII, XXIV.) D\r\nis a hexagonal enclosure; whole circumference three hundred feet,\r\neach side fifty feet, with a gateway at the eastern corner. On the\r\nopposite side of Brush creek is a large elliptical mound, E. This\r\ngroup occupies a broad, elevated plain. Numerous other works occur in\r\nthe same county. [p094]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIII.  No. 2.[71]\r\n\r\nThe character of this work, which is situated in Randolph county,\r\nIndiana, is sufficiently well exhibited by the plan. In the same\r\nvicinity are other works of an interesting character, the relative\r\npositions of which are shown in the sectional map. The work of which\r\nthe enlarged plan is here given is indicated by the letter A on\r\nthe map. A precisely analogous work, of smaller size, is situated\r\non Sugar creek at C. At B is a copious spring, surrounded by an\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIV. No. 1.\r\n ANCIENT WORK, CLERMONT COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe work here presented is situated near the western border of\r\nClermont county, Ohio, about one mile east from the town of Milford,\r\nwhich is built near the junction of the East fork with the Little\r\nMiami river. It occupies the third terrace, which is here broad and\r\nfertile, and consists of those constantly recurring figures, the\r\nsquare and the circle. The plan will give a correct idea of its\r\noutline. In its form and combination, it closely resembles some\r\nof the more remarkable structures of the Scioto valley, and was\r\ndoubtless erected for a common purpose with them. It has, however,\r\none novel and interesting feature. The parallels which lead off from\r\nthe large irregular circle extend upon an isolated hill to the left,\r\nwhich is elevated perhaps fifty feet above the plain, where they end\r\nin a small circle, not more than three hundred feet in diameter. From\r\nthis circle diverging lines extend to the south-west, terminating in\r\na maze of walls unlike any others which have yet fallen under notice.\r\nA portion of the parallels and the diverging lines just mentioned\r\nare much reduced, and when the crops are on the ground, are hardly\r\ntraceable.\r\n\r\nFrom the hill an extensive prospect is afforded, bringing in view the\r\nsites of several large groups of works in the vicinity. It has been\r\nsuggested that the structures upon the hill were devoted to rites\r\nanalogous to those attending the primitive hill or grove worship of\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of this work shows clearly that the irregularity of the\r\ngreat circle is due to the nature of the ground, and that the terrace\r\nbank bordering the old bed of the East fork existed at the period\r\nof the construction of the work. The river now flows a considerable\r\ndistance to the southward. [p095]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXIV. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Near Milford, Clermont Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. On E.

Ohio.]\r\n\r\nAbout four miles above the Milford work, on the East fork of the\r\nLittle Miami, is a small rectangular work. It is entirely isolated.\r\nIts sides measure each seven hundred feet; and it has gateways at\r\neach corner and midway on each side.\r\n\r\nA very good survey of this work was made many years ago by Gen. LYTLE\r\nof Cincinnati, and published in Worden’s Appendix to Du Paix’s work\r\non the antiquities of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIV. No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe work indicated by the letter A is situated upon the opposite\r\nside of the Little Miami, from that last described. The plan, which\r\nis also from a survey by Gen. LYTLE, sufficiently explains its\r\ncharacter. Several mounds occur in the vicinity of this work, and a\r\nfew miles below, at Newtown, there is a considerable group of large\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles above these remains, upon the East fork of the\r\nLittle Miami, is a singular work, a plan of which, B, is here given.\r\nIt was also surveyed by Gen. LYTLE, and a plan of it appears both in\r\nDu Paix’s work, and in the appendix to Hugh Williamson’s work on the\r\nclimate of America. Whether both plans are from the same survey is\r\nunknown; they however coincide in all important particulars. Without\r\nvouching for the entire accuracy of the plan, we may be permitted\r\nto say that there can be no doubt of the existence of a work of\r\nthis general and extraordinary outline, at the point indicated. Its\r\nthorough investigation is an object greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIV. Nos. 3 and 4.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, GREENE COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3.—This group is situated on Massie’s creek, about half a\r\nmile below the fortified promontory already described, Plate XII,\r\nNo. 3. It has no features worthy of special notice. The walls of the\r\nsemi-circles are about five feet in height.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 4.—The polygon here presented is situated on the right bank\r\nof the Little Miami river, seven miles above Xenia, Greene county,\r\nOhio. It lies chiefly in S. 24, T. 4, and R. 8, and closely resembles\r\nseveral of the Kentucky works, plans of which are given on Plate\r\nXIV. It was probably designed for defence. A [p096] number of other\r\nworks occur in this vicinity. One of considerable size is found at\r\nOldtown, near the former site of the “Old Miami towns,” so famous in\r\nthe history of our Indian wars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the earthworks of the Ohio valley, there is a small but very\r\ninteresting class, which has hitherto most unaccountably escaped\r\nobservation. They are not enclosures, nor can we with propriety\r\ndesignate them as mounds, according to the technical application\r\nof the term in this work. They bear some resemblance to the\r\n“animal-shaped mounds” of Wisconsin, to which public attention has\r\nrecently been several times directed; but from their position,\r\ndependencies, and other circumstances, they seem clearly of a\r\ndifferent origin and dedicated to a different purpose. For reasons\r\nwhich cannot fail to be obvious to every mind, after an examination\r\nof the illustrations which follow, they have been classed as works\r\nof sacred origin. Their character, so far as known, will appear from\r\nthe examples here presented. What may have been their mythological\r\nsignification, it is perhaps hopeless for us to inquire. They possess\r\nsome truly remarkable analogies to remains of other portions of the\r\nglobe, which will furnish the studious inquirer with matter for\r\ndeeply interesting speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXV.\r\n THE GREAT SERPENT, ADAMS COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nProbably the most extraordinary earthwork thus far discovered at\r\nthe West, is the Great Serpent, of which a faithful delineation is\r\ngiven in the accompanying plan. It is situated on Brush creek, at\r\na point known as the “Three Forks,” on Entry 1014, near the north\r\nline of Adams county, Ohio. No plan or description has hitherto been\r\npublished; nor does the fact of its existence appear to have been\r\nknown beyond the secluded vicinity in which it occurs. The notice\r\nfirst received by the authors of these researches was exceedingly\r\nvague and indefinite, and led to the conclusion that it was a\r\nwork of defence, with bastions at regular intervals,—a feature so\r\nextraordinary as to induce a visit, which resulted in the discovery\r\nhere presented. The true character of the work was apparent on the\r\nfirst inspection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXV. Great Serpent, Adams Co. Ohio.]\r\n\r\nIt is situated upon a high, crescent-form hill or spur of land,\r\nrising one hundred and fifty feet above the level of Brush creek,\r\nwhich washes its base. The side of the hill next the stream presents\r\na perpendicular wall of rock, while the other [p097] slopes\r\nrapidly, though it is not so steep as to preclude cultivation. The\r\ntop of the hill is not level but slightly convex, and presents a very\r\neven surface, one hundred and fifty feet wide by one thousand long,\r\nmeasuring from its extremity to the point where it connects with the\r\ntable land. Conforming to the curve of the hill, and occupying its\r\nvery summit, is the serpent, its head resting near the point, and its\r\nbody winding back for seven hundred feet, in graceful undulations,\r\nterminating in a triple coil at the tail. The entire length, if\r\nextended, would be not less than one thousand feet. The accompanying\r\nplan, laid down from accurate survey, can alone give an adequate\r\nconception of the outline of the work, which is clearly and boldly\r\ndefined, the embankment being upwards of five feet in height by\r\nthirty feet base, at the centre of the body, but diminishing somewhat\r\ntowards the head and tail. The neck of the serpent is stretched out\r\nand slightly curved, and its mouth is opened wide as if in the act\r\nof swallowing or ejecting an oval figure, which rests partially\r\nwithin the distended jaws. This oval is formed by an embankment of\r\nearth, without any perceptible opening, four feet in height, and is\r\nperfectly regular in outline, its transverse and conjugate diameters\r\nbeing one hundred and sixty and eighty feet respectively. The ground\r\nwithin the oval is slightly elevated: a small circular elevation of\r\nlarge stones much burned once existed in its centre; but they have\r\nbeen thrown down and scattered by some ignorant visitor, under the\r\nprevailing impression probably that gold was hidden beneath them. The\r\npoint of the hill, within which this egg-shaped figure rests, seems\r\nto have been artificially cut to conform to its outline, leaving a\r\nsmooth platform, ten feet wide, and somewhat inclining inwards, all\r\naround it. The section «a b» will illustrate this feature.\r\n\r\nUpon either side of the serpent’s head extend two small triangular\r\nelevations, ten or twelve feet over. They are not high, and although\r\ntoo distinct to be overlooked, are yet too much obliterated to be\r\nsatisfactorily traced. Besides a platform, or level oval terrace,\r\nat B, and a large mound in the centre of the isthmus connecting\r\nthe hill with the table land beyond, there are no other remains,\r\nexcepting a few mounds, within six or eight miles,—none, perhaps,\r\nnearer than the entrenched hill in Highland county, (see Plate V,)\r\nthirteen miles distant. There are a number of works lower down on\r\nBrush creek, towards its mouth; but their character is not known. The\r\npoint on which this effigy occurs commands an extensive prospect,\r\noverlooking the “bottoms” found at the junction of the three\r\nprincipal tributaries of the creek. The alluvial terraces are here\r\nquite extensive, and it is a matter of surprise that no works occur\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe serpent, separate or in combination with the circle, egg, or\r\nglobe, has been a predominant symbol among many primitive nations.\r\nIt prevailed in Egypt, Greece, and Assyria, and entered widely into\r\nthe superstitions of the Celts, the Hindoos, and the Chinese. It even\r\npenetrated into America; and was conspicuous in the mythology of the\r\nancient Mexicans, among whom its significance does not seem to have\r\ndiffered materially from that which it possessed in the old world.\r\nThe fact that the ancient Celts, and perhaps other nations of the\r\nold continent, erected sacred structures in the form of the serpent,\r\nis one of high interest. Of this description was the great temple\r\nof Abury, in England,—in many respects the most imposing ancient\r\nmonument of the British islands. [p098]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in this connection, to trace the analogies which\r\nthe Ohio structure exhibits to the serpent temples of England, or to\r\npoint out the extent to which the symbol was applied in America,—an\r\ninvestigation fraught with the greatest interest both in respect\r\nto the light which it reflects upon the primitive superstitions of\r\nremotely separated people, and especially upon the origin of the\r\nAmerican race.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVI. No. 1.\r\n “THE CROSS,” PICKAWAY COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe work here figured is found near the little town of Tarlton,\r\nPickaway county, Ohio, in the narrow valley of “Salt creek,” a\r\ntributary of the Scioto river, eighteen miles north-east from\r\nChillicothe, on the great road to Zanesville. In position it\r\ncorresponds generally with the remarkable work last described,\r\nthough wholly unlike it in form. It occupies a narrow spur of\r\nland, at a prominent point of the valley; its form is that of a\r\nGreek cross, ninety feet between the ends, and elevated three feet\r\nabove the adjacent surface. It is surrounded by a slight ditch,\r\ncorresponding to the outline of the elevation; in the centre is a\r\ncircular depression, twenty feet across and twenty inches deep. The\r\nsides of the cross correspond very nearly with the cardinal points.\r\nImmediately back of it, is a small circular elevation of stone and\r\nearth, resembling that in connection with the Granville effigy, (No.\r\n2 of the Plate,) and denominated an altar in the description of that\r\nwork. Several small mounds occur near by; and upon the high hill, a\r\nspur of which is occupied by the cross, are several large mounds.\r\nMounds are quite numerous in this little valley, and on the hills\r\nbordering it; but it is not known to contain any enclosures.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVI. No. 2.\r\n “THE ALLIGATOR,” LICKING COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThis strange work occupies a position somewhat analogous to that\r\nof the great serpent already described. It occurs about one mile\r\nbelow the town of Granville, Licking county, Ohio, upon a high and\r\nbeautifully rounded spur of land, which projects boldly into the\r\ndelightful valley of “Raccoon creek,” a stream which, in conjunction\r\nwith the “South fork,” forms Licking creek or river, the principal\r\n[p099] tributary of the Muskingum. The hill or headland is one\r\nhundred and fifty or two hundred feet in height; and the effigy\r\nrests upon its very brow, conforming to its longitudinal as well\r\nas lateral curve. Its form is accurately indicated in the plan.\r\nIt is known in the vicinity as “the Alligator;” which designation\r\nhas been adopted, for want of a better, although the figure bears\r\nas close a resemblance to the lizard as any other reptile. It is\r\nplaced transversely to the point of land on which it occurs, the\r\nhead pointing to the south-west; its precise bearing is S. 67° W.\r\nThe total length from the point of the nose following the curve\r\nof the tail to the tip, is about two hundred and fifty feet; the\r\nbreadth of the body forty feet; and the length of the legs or paws,\r\neach thirty-six feet. The ends of the paws are a little broader than\r\nthe remaining portions of the same, as if the spread of the toes\r\nhad been originally indicated. The head, shoulders, and rump, are\r\nmore elevated than the other parts of the body, an attempt having\r\nevidently been made to preserve the proportions of the object copied.\r\nThe outline of the figure is clearly defined; its average height is\r\nnot less than four feet; at the shoulders it is six feet in altitude.\r\nUpon the inner side of the effigy is an elevated circular space,\r\ncovered with stones which have been much burned. This has been\r\ndenominated an altar. Leading from it to the top of the effigy is a\r\ngraded way, ten feet broad. The earth has been excavated at various\r\npoints of the figure; but nothing was disclosed except the fact\r\nthat the framework is composed of stones of considerable size. The\r\nsuperstructure is of fine clay, which seems to have been brought from\r\na distance, as no signs of excavation are apparent in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXVI.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. “The Cross”, Near Tarlton, Pickaway Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. “The Alligator”, Near Granville, Licking Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Rock Mill Work, Fairfield Co. Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Map of Section of Newark Valley.]\r\n\r\nThe headland upon which this effigy occurs is so regular as almost\r\nto induce the belief that it has been artificially rounded. Its\r\nsymmetry has lately been somewhat broken by the opening of a quarry\r\nin its face, the further working of which will inevitably result in\r\nthe entire destruction of this interesting monument.[72] It commands\r\na view of the entire valley for eight or ten miles, and is by far\r\nthe most conspicuous point within that limit. Its prominence is,\r\nof necessity, somewhat exaggerated in the small map “exhibiting a\r\nsection of six miles of the Newark valley,” (No. 4 of the Plate,) in\r\nwhich it is indicated by the letter A. The extensive work E, in the\r\nvicinity of Newark, would be distinctly visible from this point, in\r\nthe absence of the intervening forests. In the valley immediately\r\nopposite, and less than half a mile distant, is a large and beautiful\r\ncircular work, C. To the right, three fourths of a mile distant, is a\r\nfortified hill B, (see Plate IX,) and upon the opposing side of the\r\nvalley is another entrenched hill, D; all of which, together with\r\nnumerous mounds upon the hill-tops and in the valley, are commanded\r\nfrom this position.\r\n\r\nIt seems more than probable that this singular effigy, like that\r\nlast described, had its origin in the superstitions of its makers.\r\nIt was perhaps the high place where sacrifices were made, on stated\r\nor extraordinary occasions, and where the [p100] ancient people\r\ngathered to celebrate the rites of their unknown worship. Its\r\nposition, and all the circumstances attending it, certainly favor\r\nsuch a conclusion. The valley which it overlooks abounds in traces\r\nof the remote people, and seems to have been one of the centres of\r\nancient population.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVI. No. 3.\r\n ROCK MILL WORKS, FAIRFIELD COUNTY, OHIO.[73]\r\n\r\nThis work is remarkable as being the only one, entirely regular in\r\nits plan, which has yet been discovered occupying the summit of a\r\nhill. It is situated on the road from Lancaster, Fairfield county,\r\nOhio, to Columbus, the capital of the State, seven miles distant from\r\nthe former place, near a point known as the “Hocking river Upper\r\nFalls,” or “Rock Mill.” It consists of a small square measuring four\r\nhundred and twenty feet on each side, in combination with two small\r\ncircles, one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and ten feet in\r\ndiameter respectively. The hill is nearly two hundred feet in height,\r\nwith a slightly undulating plain of small extent at its summit. The\r\nworks are so arranged that the small circle, enclosing the mound,\r\noverlooks every part and commands a wide prospect on every hand.\r\nTowards the brow of the hill, at prominent points, are two elliptical\r\nterraces or elevations of small size. The sides of the square\r\nenclosure correspond to the cardinal points. The walls, excepting\r\nthose of the circular structures, are very slight, and unaccompanied\r\nby a ditch. The work is clearly not of a defensive origin, and\r\nmust be classed with those of similar outline occupying the river\r\nterraces. At a short distance above this point, the champaign country\r\ncommences, and no other remains are found. The erections of the\r\nmound-builders are almost exclusively confined to the borders of the\r\nwater-courses.\r\n\r\nThere are very few enclosures, so far as known, in the Hocking river\r\nvalley; there are, however, numerous mounds upon the narrow terraces\r\nand on the hills bordering them. In the vicinity of Athens are a\r\nnumber of the largest size, and also several enclosures. (See Plate\r\nXXIII.) Mounds are found upon the high bluffs in the neighborhood of\r\nLancaster, at points commanding the widest range. An examination of\r\nthe valley with a view of bringing to light its ancient monuments\r\nwould, without doubt, be attended with very interesting results.\r\n[p101]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVI. No. 4.\r\n\r\nThis little map exhibits a section of six miles of the Newark valley,\r\nshowing the relative positions of the “Newark group” (Plate XXV); the\r\n“Fortified Hill” near Granville (Plate IX); and the “Alligator,” just\r\ndescribed. But a small proportion of the mounds occurring within this\r\nrange are shown on the map.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese comprise the only works in the form of animals which have\r\nfallen under notice. The singular mound occurring within the great\r\ncircle near Newark may perhaps deserve to occupy a place with them:\r\nthat, however, has the internal characteristics of the sacrificial\r\nmounds, while the others, so far as our knowledge extends, cover no\r\nremains. The mound found within the work in Scioto county, Ohio,\r\n(Plate XXIX,) and described on a preceding page, may also rank with\r\nthem. From the information which we possess concerning the animal\r\neffigies of Wisconsin, it does not appear probable that they were\r\nconstructed for a common purpose with those of Ohio. They occur\r\nusually in considerable numbers, in ranges, upon the level prairies;\r\nwhile the few which are found in Ohio occupy elevated and commanding\r\npositions,—“high places,” as if designed to be set apart for sacred\r\npurposes. An “altar,” if we may so term it, is distinctly to be\r\nobserved in the oval enclosure connected with the “Great Serpent;”\r\none is equally distinct near the Granville work, and another in\r\nconnection with the lesser but equally interesting work near Tarlton.\r\nIf we were to deduce a conclusion from these premises, it would\r\ncertainly be, that these several effigies possessed a symbolical\r\nmeaning, and were the objects of superstitious regard.\r\n\r\nWhether any other works of this description occur in the State\r\nor valley is not known; it is extremely likely, however, that a\r\nsystematic examination of the whole field would result in the\r\ndiscovery of others equally remarkable, and perhaps disclose a\r\nconnection between them and the animal effigies of the North-west,\r\nalready alluded to. The facts that none of these singular remains\r\nhave been noticed, and that up to this time not a single intimation\r\nof their existence has been made public, show how little attention\r\nhas been bestowed upon our antiquities, and how much remains to be\r\naccomplished before we can fully comprehend them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the character of a large proportion of the ancient monuments\r\nof the Mississippi valley. How far a faithful attention to their\r\ndetails has tended to [p102] sustain the position assigned them\r\nat the commencement of this chapter, the intelligent reader must\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThe great size of most of the foregoing structures precludes the idea\r\nthat they were «temples» in the general acceptation of the term.\r\nAs has already been intimated, they were probably, like the great\r\ncircles of England, and the squares of India, Peru, and Mexico, the\r\nsacred enclosures, within which were erected the shrines of the\r\ngods of the ancient worship and the altars of the ancient religion.\r\nThey may have embraced consecrated groves, and also, as they did in\r\nMexico, the residences of the ancient priesthood. Like the sacred\r\nstructures of the country last named, some of them may have been\r\nsecondarily designed for protection in times of danger; “for,” says\r\nGomara, “the force and strength of every Mexican city is its temple.”\r\nHowever that may be, we know that it has been a practice, common\r\nto almost every people in every time, to enclose their temples and\r\naltars with walls of various materials, so as to guard the sacred\r\narea around them from the desecration of animals or the intrusion of\r\nthe profane. Spots consecrated by tradition, or rendered remarkable\r\nas the scene of some extraordinary event, or by whatever means\r\nconnected with the superstitions, or invested with the reverence of\r\nmen, have always been designated in this or some similar manner. The\r\nSouth Sea Islander, as did the ancient Sclavonian, encircles his\r\n«tabooed» or consecrated tree with a fence of woven branches; the\r\npagoda of the Hindoo is enclosed by high and massive walls, within\r\nwhich the scoffer at his religion finds no admittance; the sacred\r\nsquare of the Caaba can only be entered in a posture of humiliation\r\nand with unshod feet; and the assurance that “this is holy ground”\r\nis impressed upon every one who, at this day, approaches the temples\r\nof the true God. The block idol of the poor Laplander has its sacred\r\nlimit within which the devotee only ventures on bended knees and with\r\nface to the earth; the oak-crowned Druid taught the mysteries of\r\nhis stern religion in temples of unhewn stones, open to the sun, in\r\nrude but gigantic structures, which in their form symbolized the God\r\nof his adoration; conquerors humbled themselves as they approached\r\nthe precincts which the voice of the Pythoness had consecrated; no\r\nworshipper trod the avenues guarded by the silent, emblematic Sphynx,\r\nexcept with awe and reverence; and Christ indignantly thrust from\r\nthe sacred area of the temple on Mount Zion the money-changers who\r\nhad defiled it with their presence. “Thou shalt set bounds to the\r\npeople round about,—set bounds to the mount and sanctify it,” was\r\nthe injunction of Jehovah from the holy mountain. Among the savage\r\ntribes of North America, none but the pure dared enter the place\r\ndedicated to the rude but significant rites of their religion. In\r\nPeru none except of the blood of the royal Incas, whose father was\r\nthe sun, were permitted to pass the walls surrounding the gorgeous\r\ntemples of their primitive worship; and the imperial Montezuma humbly\r\nsought the pardon of his insulted gods for venturing to introduce his\r\nunbelieving conqueror within the area consecrated by their shrines.\r\n\r\nAnalogy would therefore seem to indicate that the structures under\r\nconsideration, or at least a large portion of them, were nothing\r\nmore than sacred enclosures. If so, it may be inquired, what has\r\nbecome of the temples and shrines which they [p103] enclosed? It is\r\nvery obvious that, unless composed of stone or other imperishable\r\nmaterial, they must long since have completely disappeared, without\r\nleaving a trace of their existence. We find nevertheless, within\r\nthese enclosures, the altars upon which the ancient people performed\r\ntheir sacrifices. We find also pyramidal structures, (as at\r\nPortsmouth, Marietta, and other places,) which correspond entirely\r\nwith those of Mexico and Central America, except that, instead of\r\nbeing composed of stone, they are constructed of earth, and instead\r\nof broad flights of steps, have graded avenues and spiral pathways\r\nleading to their summits. If these pyramidal structures sustained\r\nedifices corresponding to those which crowned the Mexican and Central\r\nAmerican «Teocalli», they were doubtless, in keeping with the\r\ncomparative rudeness of their builders, composed of wood; in which\r\ncase, it would be in vain, at this day, to look for any positive\r\ntraces of their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] “I have reason to agree with Stukely, that the circumstance of\r\nthe ditch being «within» the vallum is a distinguishing mark between\r\nreligious and military works.”—«Sir R. C. Hoare on the Monuments of\r\nEngland.»\r\n\r\n[37] Marked J in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[38] This work is marked D in the Map, Plate II. Since this\r\nPlate was engraved, it has been ascertained that a plan of this\r\nwork was published in the “Portfolio,” in 1809. The two plans\r\nare substantially alike, except that the one in the “Portfolio”\r\nrepresents the parallels as terminating in a small circle, and\r\nas connected with the large circle,—both of which features are\r\nerroneous. The walls of the parallels are much obliterated, where\r\nthey approach the bank of the terrace.\r\n\r\n[39] Indicated by the letters B and C, in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[40] These works are marked E and F respectively, in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[41] Indicated by the letter K, in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[42] To put, at once, all skepticism at rest, which might otherwise\r\narise as to the «regularity» of these works, it should be stated that\r\nthey were all carefully surveyed by the authors in person. Of course,\r\nno difficulty existed in determining the perfect regularity of the\r\nsquares. The method of procedure, in respect to the circles, was\r\nas follows. Flags were raised at regular and convenient intervals,\r\nupon the embankments, representing stations. The compass was then\r\nplaced alternately at these stations, and the bearing of the flag\r\nnext beyond ascertained. If the angles thus determined proved to be\r\ncoincident, the regularity of the work was placed beyond doubt. The\r\nsupplementary plan A indicates the method of survey, the “Field Book”\r\nof which, the circle being thirty-six hundred feet in circumference,\r\nand the stations three hundred feet apart, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n STATION.

This and the\r\nsucceeding work are represented by Mr. Atwater in the Archæologia\r\nAmericana, vol. i. p. 146; with what fidelity, an inspection of the\r\nrespective plans will show.\r\n\r\n[44] Indicated by the letter A, in Map 2, Plate III.\r\n\r\n[45] Mr. Atwater («Archæologia Americana», vol. i. p. 143) describes\r\nthe small mound at «e», as composed “entirely of red ochre, which\r\nanswers very well as a paint!” Its «present» composition is a clayey\r\nloam. It has been examined and found to contain an altar.\r\n\r\n[46] This work is designated by the letter H on the Map, already\r\nseveral times referred to, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[47] Their general character is indicated in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[48] The site of the town of Frankfort was formerly that of a famous\r\nShawnee town. The burial place of the Indian town is shown in the\r\nplan; from it numerous relics are obtained,—gun-barrels, copper\r\nkettles, silver crosses and brooches, and many other implements and\r\nornaments which, in accordance with aboriginal custom, were buried\r\nwith the dead. Some of them, from being found in close proximity to\r\nthe work above described, have erroneously been supposed to appertain\r\nto the race of the mound-builders.\r\n\r\n[49] Archæologia Americana, vol. i. p. 142.\r\n\r\n[50] This group is indicated by G in the Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[51] Indicated by A, in Map, Plate II.\r\n\r\n[52] The proportions of the circles, etc., are necessarily somewhat\r\nexaggerated in the plan: their relative positions are, however, very\r\naccurately preserved.\r\n\r\n[53] There are some singular structures in Sweden, which coincide\r\nvery nearly with this remarkable little work. They are circles\r\ncomposed of upright stones, having short avenues of approach upon\r\neach side, opposite each other, in the manner here represented. See\r\n«Sjöborg’s Samlingar för Nordens Fornälskare», 1822.\r\n\r\n[54] A number of plans of these works, as well as of those at\r\nMarietta, have been published; but they are all very defective, and\r\nfail to convey an accurate conception of the group. The map here\r\ngiven is from an original and very careful and minute survey made\r\nin 1836, by CHAS. WHITTLESEY, Esq., Topographical Engineer of the\r\nState of Ohio, corrected and verified by careful re-surveys and\r\nadmeasurements by the authors. It may be relied upon as strictly\r\ncorrect. A large portion of the more complicated division of the\r\ngroup has, within the past few years, been almost completely\r\ndemolished, so that the lines can no longer be satisfactorily traced.\r\nIt is to be hoped that care may be taken to preserve the remainder\r\nfrom a like fate. The principal structures will always resist the\r\nreducing action of the plough: but, from present indications, the\r\nconnecting lines and smaller works will soon be levelled to the\r\nsurface, and leave but a scanty and doubtful trace of their former\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nA sectional map of the Newark valley is given in a subsequent plate,\r\non which the relative positions of this and other works of the\r\nvicinity are indicated with approximate accuracy.\r\n\r\n[55] “Great as some of these works are, and laborious as was their\r\nconstruction, particularly those of Circleville and «Newark», I am\r\npersuaded «they were never intended for military defences».”—«General\r\nHarrison’s Discourse».\r\n\r\n[56] The following passages, embodying some interesting facts\r\nrespecting these works, were communicated by I. DILLE, Esq., now and\r\nfor many years a resident of Newark:\r\n\r\n“You are aware that the principal part of these remains are situated\r\nin the valley between the Raccoon creek and the South fork of\r\nLicking creek. The valley is here nearly two miles wide, from\r\nstream to stream. To the east of the lines of embankment and on the\r\nsecond bottom of the creek are numerous mounds. Some of these are\r\nvery low,—so low, indeed, that a careless observer would hardly\r\ndistinguish them from the common surface. Some of them are surrounded\r\nby a low circular wall of earth which, with a little attention,\r\ncan be distinctly traced. In the year 1828, when constructing the\r\ncanal, a lock was located on the site of one of these low mounds.\r\nIn excavating the lock pit, «fourteen» human skeletons were found\r\nabout four feet beneath the surface. These were very much decayed,\r\nand supposed by some to have been burnt. It was probably the natural\r\nappearance of decomposition which led to this opinion. On coming\r\nto the air they all mouldered into dust. Over these skeletons, and\r\ncarefully and regularly disposed, was laid a large quantity of mica\r\nin sheets or plates. Some of these were eight and ten inches long\r\nby four and five wide, and all from half an inch to an inch thick.\r\nIt was estimated that «fifteen or twenty bushels of this material»\r\nwere thrown out to form the walls or supports of the lock. From a\r\nmound some four feet high, a few rods to the south of this, a large\r\n«volvaria» (sea-shell) was taken.\r\n\r\n“On the opposite side of the creek I found, in one place,\r\n«twenty-four» flint axes, or imperfect arrow-heads. These were found\r\non the third bottom, on a promontory projecting towards the works\r\nin question. A very great quantity of broken flints were found\r\nhere—enough to load a cart. They were of the same variety of flint,\r\nchert, or hornstone, which abounds on ‘Flint Ridge.’ On that ridge\r\nthere is the appearance of a great deal of digging. Deep holes cover\r\nthe ground for the extent of a mile. Many have supposed that these\r\nwere mines of the precious metals, and no small amount of money\r\nand time has been expended in the search. I am of the opinion this\r\nplace is the source of all the arrow-heads, flint axes, and other\r\nimplements of that material, which have been used over a wide extent\r\nof territory.\r\n\r\n“Separate from these valley works, and two miles to the west of them,\r\nis an irregular enclosure on a hill. The walls are of earth about\r\nthree feet high, and enclose an area of some thirty or forty acres,\r\nextending from the top to the very foot of a high, long, and sloping\r\nhill. Again, two miles distant in a north-west direction, the summit\r\nof a high hill is surrounded by a similar embankment.”\r\n\r\n[57] The map here presented is drawn from a careful survey of these\r\nworks, made in 1837, by CHARLES WHITTLESEY, Esq., Topographical\r\nEngineer of the State, under the law authorizing a Geological and\r\nTopographical Survey of Ohio. It has never before been published; and\r\nits fidelity, in every respect, may be relied on. It will be seen\r\nthat the supplementary or “small covert way” represented on the plan\r\nin the Archæologia Americana, does not appear. What was taken for\r\na graded way is simply a gully, worn by the rains. The topography\r\nof the map, and the accompanying sections, are features which every\r\nintelligent inquirer will know how to appreciate.\r\n\r\n[58] The description of the two principal truncated pyramids embodies\r\nthe substance of an account of the same, published by Dr. S. P.\r\nHILDRETH of Marietta, in the “American Pioneer” for June, 1843,—the\r\nentire fidelity of which has been attested by actual survey.\r\n\r\n[59] Such is the result of careful admeasurements made by Dr. JOHN\r\nLOCKE, whose accuracy in matters of this kind, as in all others, is\r\nworthy of emulation.\r\n\r\n[60] A very laudable disposition has been manifested, on the part\r\nof the citizens of Marietta, to preserve the interesting remains in\r\ntheir midst. The Directors of the Ohio Land Company, when they took\r\npossession of the country at the mouth of the Muskingum, in 1788,\r\nadopted immediate measures for the preservation of these monuments.\r\nTo their credit be it said, one of their earliest official acts was\r\nthe passage of a resolution, which is entered upon the journal of\r\ntheir proceedings, reserving the two truncated pyramids and the great\r\nmound, with a few acres attached to each, as public squares. They\r\nplaced them under the care of the future corporation of Marietta,\r\ndirecting that they should be embellished with shade trees, when\r\ndivested of the forest which then covered them, which trees, it was\r\nadded, should be of «native» growth, and of the varieties named in\r\nthe resolution. The great mound with its surrounding square was\r\ndesignated as a cemetery, and placed under the control of trustees.\r\nTen years ago, these structures being yet unenclosed and much injured\r\nby the rains washing through the paths caused by the cattle that\r\nroamed over them, the citizens raised a sum of money adequate to the\r\npurpose, and fully restored them. The magnificent avenue named, not\r\ninappropriately, by the Directors, “«Sacra Via»,” or Sacred Way,\r\nbut now generally known as the “Covered Way,” was also preserved\r\nby a special resolution of the Company, “never to be disturbed or\r\ndefaced, as common ground, not to be enclosed.” One of the streets\r\nof Marietta, Warren street, passes through this avenue. It is, of\r\ncourse, impossible to resist encroachments upon the walls of the\r\nenclosures, which are rapidly disappearing.\r\n\r\nHad a similar enlightened policy marked the proceedings of all the\r\nearly companies and settlers of the West, we should not now have\r\noccasion to regret the entire obliteration of many interesting\r\nremains of antiquity. Or did a similar disposition exist generally,\r\nthere would be less necessity for a careful, systematic, and\r\n«immediate» survey of our remaining monuments. The works at\r\nChillicothe, Circleville, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, might have\r\nbeen preserved with all ease: and would have constituted striking\r\nornaments to those cities, to say nothing of the interest which would\r\nattach to them in other points of view. It is proper to observe, that\r\nthe facts embraced in this note were kindly communicated by Dr. S. P.\r\nHILDRETH, of Marietta.\r\n\r\n[61] The account of an English adventurer named «Ashe», respecting\r\nsome extraordinary remains which he professed to have discovered\r\nhere, it is hardly necessary to say, is entitled to no credit\r\nwhatever. The remark holds good of similar accounts, by the same\r\nhand, of some of the works at Newark, one hundred miles above, on the\r\nupper tributaries of the Muskingum.\r\n\r\n[62] From the Survey and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq.\r\n\r\n[63] From the Survey and Notes of CHARLES WHITTLESEY, Esq.\r\n\r\n[64] From the Plan and Notes of CHARLES WHITTLESEY, Esq.\r\n\r\n[65] From the Survey and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE Esq.\r\n\r\n[66] From the Survey and Notes of JAMES MCBRIDE Esq.\r\n\r\n[67] “It consists of a ditch dug down to the edge of the river, the\r\nearth from which has been thrown up principally upon the lower or\r\ndown river side. The breadth between the parapets is much greater\r\nnear the water than at any other point, so that it might have been\r\nused for the purpose of affording a safe passage to the river or as a\r\nsort of harbor in which canoes may have been drawn up or both. This\r\nwater way resembles that found at Marietta though smaller.”—«Long’s\r\nSecond Expedition», vol. i. p. 60.\r\n\r\n[68] The reader is requested to compare the plan of this work given\r\nby Mr. ATWATER in the Archæologia Americana, with the one here\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n[69] Previous to the entire destruction of this mound, and at the\r\ntime when about one half of it remained, it was examined by Mr.\r\nMcBride, from whose original notes the following observations\r\nrespecting it are taken:\r\n\r\n“The mound was composed of rich surface mould, evidently scooped\r\nup from the surface; scattered through which were pebbles and some\r\nstones of considerable size, all of which had been burned. Upon\r\nexcavation, we found a skeleton with its head to the east, resting\r\nupon the original surface of the ground, immediately under the apex\r\nof the mound. Some distance above this was a layer of ashes of\r\nconsiderable extent, and about four inches thick. The skeleton was of\r\nordinary size; the skull was crushed, and all the bones in extreme\r\ndecay. Near the surface were other skeletons. The inhabitants of the\r\nneighborhood tell of a copper band with strange devices, found around\r\nthe brow of a skeleton in this mound; and also of a well carved\r\nrepresentation of a tortoise of the same metal, twelve or fourteen\r\ninches in length, found with another skeleton.”\r\n\r\n[70] From the Rafinesque MSS.\r\n\r\n[71] From the Survey of JAMES MCBRIDE.\r\n\r\n[72] The proprietor of this structure, ASHEL AYLESWORTH, Esq., we are\r\nhappy to say, has determined to permit no further encroachment upon\r\nit. It is to be hoped that the citizens of Granville will adopt means\r\nto permanently and effectually secure it from invasion.\r\n\r\n[73] This work should have been figured on a preceding plate. Its\r\nposition, in connection with the effigies here described, was\r\ndetermined by accidental circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p104]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER  IV.\r\n MONUMENTS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in possession of very little authentic information respecting\r\nthe monuments of the Southern United States.[74] All accounts\r\nconcur in representing them as very numerous and extensive, and as\r\ncharacterized by a regularity unknown, or known but to a limited\r\ndegree, amongst those which occur further north, on the Ohio and\r\nits tributaries, and upon the Missouri and Upper Mississippi. This\r\nextraordinary regularity, as well as their usually great dimensions,\r\nhave induced many to regard them as the work not only of a different\r\nera, but of a different people. Mounds of several stages, closely\r\nresembling the Mexican «Teocalli» in form and size; broad terraces of\r\nvarious heights; elevated passages and long avenues, are mentioned\r\namong the varieties of ancient structures which abound from Florida\r\nto Texas. The mounds are often disposed with the utmost system in\r\nrespect to each other. Around some of the larger ones, others of\r\nsmaller size are placed at regular intervals, and at fixed distances.\r\nSome have spiral pathways leading to their tops, and others possess\r\ngraded ascents like those at Marietta.[75]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that while mounds are thus abundant,\r\nenclosures are comparatively few, especially those which seem to be\r\nof a military origin. A few have been noticed in South Carolina, on\r\nthe Wateree river, which partake of the character of military works,\r\nand of which some account will shortly be given.\r\n\r\nThe following plans from original and hitherto unpublished surveys\r\nwill serve to illustrate, to a limited degree, the character of a\r\nportion of the Southern remains. [p105]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXVII. Ancient Works on the Wateree River, Kershaw\r\nDistrict, South Carolina.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVII.\r\n REMAINS ON THE WATEREE RIVER, KERSHAW DISTRICT, SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the race of the mounds occupied a portion\r\nof the State of South Carolina; and although the traces of their\r\noccupation are far from abundant, they are still sufficiently\r\nnumerous to deserve notice. The only reliable information we have\r\nconcerning them, is contained in a MS. letter from WILLIAM BLANDING,\r\nM. D., late of Camden, South Carolina, a gentleman distinguished for\r\nhis researches in natural history, to SAMUEL GEORGE MORTON, M. D., of\r\nPhiladelphia, the eminent author of “«Crania Americana»,” by whose\r\npermission it is embodied in this connection. The observations of\r\nDr. Blanding were confined to a section of the valley of the Wateree\r\nriver, embracing about twenty-five miles in the immediate vicinity of\r\nCamden, and mainly included in the Kershaw district.\r\n\r\n“The first monument deserving of notice is ‘Harrison’s Mound’ (A in\r\nthe Map). It is the highest in position of any on the river, and is\r\nsituated on the west side of the same, in the Fairfield district. It\r\nis about four hundred and eighty feet in circumference at the base,\r\nfifteen feet high, and has a level area one hundred and twenty feet\r\nin circumference at its summit.\r\n\r\n“The next relic of antiquity is the ‘Indian Mortar,’ (B in the Map,)\r\nin the Kershaw district. It is a regular bowl-shaped excavation in\r\na solid block of granite, holding upwards of half a bushel, and is\r\nevidently the work of art. It [p106] was used as a mortar by the\r\nearly settlers, and is still devoted to the same purpose. The part of\r\nthe rock projecting out of the ground is equivalent to eight or ten\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n“Next is an old Indian town or camp near the mouth of Beaver creek\r\n(C in the Map). A little below the mouth of the creek is an old\r\nfortification, of oblong form, consisting of a wall and ditch (D in\r\nthe Map). The embankment is now not more than three feet high above\r\nthe level of the plain. The ditch is distinct. Nearly opposite this\r\nwork, on the west side of the river, are the traces of an old Indian\r\nvillage, remarkable for its arrow-heads, fragments of pottery, etc.\r\n\r\n“Proceeding down the river, we come to a point near the head of the\r\ncanal, where the land rises to the extraordinary height of five\r\nhundred feet, forming a long, narrow hill. Upon the point of this\r\nhill nearest the river, stands what is called the ‘Indian Grave’\r\n(F in the Map). It is composed of many tons of small round stones,\r\nweighing from one to four pounds each. The pile is thirty feet long\r\nfrom east to west, twelve feet broad, and five feet high, so situated\r\nas to command an extensive view of the adjacent country, stretching\r\nas far as Rocky Mount, twenty miles above, and for a long distance\r\nbelow on the river. It may be suggested that this is the elevated\r\nburial-place of some great chief, or that it was designed as some\r\nsort of an observatory. The Catawba Indians can give no account of\r\nit, nor will they venture a conjecture as to its purposes. A mound,\r\nG, is situated opposite this stone heap, on the other side of the\r\nriver. The ‘shoals’ in the immediate vicinity seem to have been a\r\nfavorite haunt of the ancient and more recent races. Here to this\r\nday is to be found an abundance of fish and game, and the vicinity\r\nis marked by numerous aboriginal relics. Here also is the highest\r\nboundary of the long-leaved pine, and the limit of the alluvial\r\nregion. Below, the river becomes sluggish, and during high water\r\nleaves its banks and spreads over large tracts of land.\r\n\r\n“The mound next below, H, was two hundred and fifty feet in\r\ncircumference at the base, seventy-five feet at the top, and thirteen\r\nfeet high. It was situated about a hundred yards from the river on\r\nlands subject to overflow. Three other small mounds surrounded it.\r\nIn 1826 it was levelled, and the material used for manuring the\r\nadjacent lands. A part of the treasures which it contained were\r\nsaved, but the rest are scattered or destroyed. The mound presented,\r\nupon excavation, a succession of strata, varying in thickness from\r\nsix inches to one foot, from top to base. First vegetable loam,\r\nthen human and animal bones, followed by charcoal of reeds, vessels\r\nof clay and fragments of the same, (some holding not more than one\r\npint,) arrow-heads and stone axes, then earth, etc., alternately. In\r\none small vessel was found a «tag» or needle made of bone, supposed\r\nto have been used in making dresses. Near it was found the skeleton\r\nof a female, tolerably entire, but which fell in pieces on exposure.\r\nA stratum of dark-colored mould was mixed with these articles;\r\nperhaps decomposed animal matter. The superstructure of the mound was\r\nthe alluvial loam, and constituted tolerable manure. It was mixed\r\nwith great quantities of mica, some pieces three or four inches\r\nsquare. Marine shells, much decomposed, were found in this as in\r\nother mounds, mixed with the bones, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n“Descending the river, near Mound creek, we come to a large mound, I,\r\nenclosed [p107] in a circle, and accompanied by a smaller one. It is\r\nperhaps the largest and most perfect on the river. It is five hundred\r\nfeet in circumference at the base, two hundred and twenty-five feet\r\nin circumference at the summit, and thirty-four feet high,—slightly\r\noblong. It is covered with stumps, briars, etc., having recently been\r\nbrought under cultivation. In April last, while ploughing over the\r\nsmall mound, an urn was discovered, a sketch of which is enclosed.\r\nIt holds forty-six quarts, or nearly twelve gallons. It had a cover\r\nfitting closely over the body for about six inches; this was broken\r\nby the plough. The vessel was curiously ornamented, and is probably\r\nthe largest ever discovered in the valley. It contained a number\r\nof large shell beads, much decomposed, about the size and shape of\r\nnutmegs. It also contained another article of the same material,\r\nabout the size of a man’s palm, a quarter of an inch thick, and\r\ncarved in open work; probably designed for suspension around the neck\r\nas a badge or ornament. The ditch around this mound is slight.\r\n\r\n“Still further down the river, upon the opposite side, and some\r\ndistance south of the road from Camden to Columbia, is the most\r\nremarkable ancient work in the valley (O). It is called the ‘Indian\r\nDitch.’ It occurs at the great bend of the river, and consists of an\r\nembankment and ditch carried across the isthmus, cutting off, and,\r\nwith the river, enclosing some hundreds of acres of fine alluvial\r\nland. It is about «one mile in length», and the circuit of the river\r\nfrom one end to the other is between three and four miles. Twenty-one\r\nyears ago, when I first visited it, this ditch was about eight feet\r\ndeep and the wall of corresponding dimensions: a primitive forest was\r\nthen growing upon its southern portion, but it is now all under the\r\nplough and fast disappearing. The bank is «exterior» to the ditch,\r\nwhich circumstance seems to conflict with the notion that the work\r\nwas constructed for defence. It has been suggested, but with no good\r\nreason, that it was designed for a ‘«cut off»’ or artificial channel\r\nfor the river. Whatever its purpose, it was a great undertaking for a\r\nrude or savage people.\r\n\r\n“On the opposite side of the river, about two hundred yards below the\r\nmouth of Pine-tree creek, is a group of mounds, surrounded by a low\r\nembankment (J). One of them has been nearly washed away by the river,\r\nand the others have been much reduced by cultivation. The largest is\r\nyet twelve or fifteen feet high, with a very wide base. From these\r\nmounds are disclosed arrow-heads, axes, urns, and other vestiges of\r\nart, accompanied by human bones and the bones of wild animals, and\r\nmarine shells, all much decayed. As the water washes away the side\r\nof the mound on its bank, charcoal, urns, bones, etc., in successive\r\nstrata, are exposed; as though it had constituted a cemetery,\r\nreceiving deposits from time to time, from its commencement to its\r\ncompletion. The strata vary in thickness from six to eighteen inches,\r\nand are mixed with much mica, sometimes in large plates. It was long\r\nunder cultivation in corn, then indigo, and in 1806, when I first saw\r\nit, in cotton, which is still cultivated on it. On the large mound\r\nstood the overseer’s house; around it, on the smaller piles, were the\r\nnegro quarters.\r\n\r\n“In the bend of the river nearly opposite the south end of the\r\n‘Indian Ditch,’ is a mound, perhaps fifteen feet high (K). Little\r\nis known respecting it, having been for many years the site of an\r\noverseer’s house. I obtained a circular stone, [p108] with concave\r\nsides and finely polished, which had been found here, also two\r\nlarge urns, one holding twelve, the other twenty quarts, with a\r\nnumber of other aboriginal relics. At the mouth of Town creek, some\r\ndistance below, there was formerly, no doubt, an Indian town or\r\ncamp, (L,) judging from the quantity of relics found here. A very\r\nfine description of clay is found at this spot, which is resorted to\r\nby the Catawba Indians every spring and autumn, for the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing pottery from it.\r\n\r\n“Boykin’s mound (M) is one mile lower down the river upon the same\r\nbank. It is now nearly washed away by the river. Twenty years ago,\r\nwhen I first saw it, large trees covered it, and it was entire. Four\r\nyears afterwards I visited it, when only about one third remained,\r\nwhich on the side next the river beautifully exhibited the various\r\nstrata composing it. It had the usual layers of earth, pottery,\r\ncharred reeds, etc. Some few of the vases were entire, containing\r\nfragments of bones, and were well arranged in tiers, one above the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“Last of the series is Nixon’s mound (N). It is much reduced, and\r\nis not now more than ten feet high. From this to the sea I know of\r\nno similar relics. Paint hill and Kirkwood, in the neighborhood of\r\nPine-tree creek, must have been much frequented, judging from the\r\nnumerous relics occurring on and around them; the former for its pure\r\nwater, the latter for its fine clay. Hobkirk’s hill, near Camden,\r\nabounds in aboriginal relics. I have procured several large pipes\r\nfrom these localities, all of which exhibit a skill in workmanship\r\nsurpassing that of the present race. The entire section in which the\r\nabove remains occur is exceedingly fertile, and capable of sustaining\r\na large agricultural population.”\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVIII. No. 1.[76]\r\n ANCIENT WORKS ON THE ETOWAH RIVER, ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nThis work occurs within the present limits of the State of Alabama,\r\nupon the banks of Etowah river, a branch of the Coosa. It is situated\r\nupon an alluvial “bottom,” at an angle or bend of the stream; and\r\nits defences consist of a semi-circular ditch, the flanks of which\r\nrest on the river. This ditch is twenty-five [p109] or thirty\r\nfeet in width, by eight feet in depth; and is interrupted by no less\r\nthan seven passage-ways, placed at irregular intervals, and formed\r\nby leaving the earth unexcavated at the points where they occur.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that no embankment accompanies the ditch;\r\nalthough the work is not entirely singular in that respect. Within\r\nthe enclosure thus formed by the river on the one hand and the ditch\r\non the other, are several mounds, one of which is of great size and\r\nextraordinary character. It measures upwards of seventy-five feet\r\nin height, and is twelve hundred feet in circumference at its base.\r\nIt is truncated, the area at its summit having a diameter of one\r\nhundred and forty feet. A graded avenue, which may be ascended on\r\nhorseback, leads to its top from the east. Upon its northern and\r\nsouthern sides, at the height of forty feet, are triangular platforms\r\nor terraces, which are also reached by graded ascents from the plain.\r\nThe supplementary plan A exhibits the outlines of the monument. Upon\r\nits top, trees are growing, which, at the height of a man’s head from\r\nthe ground, measure little under eleven feet in circumference. A\r\nfallen oak measured by Mr. Cornelius in 1818 was found to be, at the\r\ndistance of six feet from the branching of the roots, «twelve feet\r\nfour inches in circumference», exclusive of the bark. There are two\r\nother truncated mounds, to the south-west of the great mound, but of\r\nless dimensions. One of these has a perpendicular altitude of thirty\r\nfeet; and its summit was fortified, with a parapet and palisades, by\r\nthe Cherokees in their war with the Creeks. The earth taken from the\r\nditch above mentioned was probably used in the construction of these\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXVIII. Ancient Works:\r\n\r\nNo. 1.

Prairie Jefferson, Moorhouse Parish, Louisiana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nAn analogous work of some interest, (Fig. 21,) but partially\r\ndestroyed by the Tennessee river, upon the bank of which it stands,\r\noccurs near the town of Florence, in Alabama. “It consists of a large\r\nmound, hexagonal in form, truncated, and forty-five feet in height by\r\nfour hundred and forty feet in circumference at the base. The level\r\narea at the summit is one hundred and fifty feet in circumference. It\r\nappears to be composed of the ordinary surface loam, and is carried\r\nup with great regularity. So far as it has yet been examined, no\r\ntraces of bones or other foreign substances have been discovered.\r\n\r\n“Partly surrounding the mound is a wall two hundred and seventy feet\r\ndistant from its base, which extends from the main river below, to\r\na branch formed by Cane island above, constituting a segment of a\r\ncircle, the centre of which would be in the Tennessee river. The wall\r\nis about forty feet across the top, and, making allowances for the\r\nravages of time, must have been originally from twelve to fifteen\r\nfeet high; it is now about eight feet in height. The mound and wall\r\nbear the same marks of antiquity, both being covered with large\r\ntimber of the same age and description with that found growing on the\r\nsurrounding lands. The wall has what appears to be a ditch on the\r\noutside. [p110]\r\n\r\n“These works are situated on the river bottom, and are half\r\nsurrounded by a very high ridge, which runs parallel to the Tennessee\r\nriver, about four hundred yards distant. This ridge, upon which the\r\nprincipal part of the town of Florence is situated, overlooks and\r\nentirely commands the whole. The mound, with its surrounding wall,\r\nthus situated and exposed to attack, could hardly have been designed\r\nas a place of defence. It must have been appropriated to another\r\npurpose.”[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVIII. Nos. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThese works are specially interesting from the fact that they partake\r\nmore of the character of the works in the valley of the Ohio, than\r\nany other southern structures with which we are acquainted. The\r\naccompanying descriptions were furnished by Rev. R. MORRIS, of Mount\r\nSylvan Academy, Lafayette county, Mississippi; the plans are from\r\nsurveys by the same gentleman.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2.—“This work is situated in T. 4 S., R. 7 W., of the\r\nChickasaw surveys, five miles south-east of the Tallahatchie river.\r\nIt occupies a point of high land, overlooking the valley of a small\r\ncreek, and consists of a simple embankment of earth, about three feet\r\nin height, with an exterior ditch of corresponding dimensions. It is\r\na polygon in form, and at first glance appears entirely irregular.\r\nIt will be observed, however, that the line «c d» corresponds\r\nin length with «h i», and also that «e f» is exactly equal to\r\n«f h»,—coincidences which could not possibly be accidental. The side\r\n«c s j», fronting on the creek, is not entrenched, being sufficiently\r\nprotected by the high bluff bank. There are no interruptions in the\r\nembankment, the ends of which terminate within a short distance of\r\nthe bluff on the right, leaving passage-ways fifteen or twenty feet\r\nwide. A ditch, however, extends from «i» to «j», at the south-east\r\nangle; but it is a question whether it was not formed by the water\r\noverflowing the artificial ditch at «i». The angles of this work\r\nare not rounded, but sharp as if newly dug. There are two points,\r\n(indicated by the letter «s» on the plan,) one on a spur of land\r\nwithin the enclosure, and the other at the extreme point of the\r\nheadland on which the work is situated, where there are excavations\r\nfrom which the earth is thrown up on the outer side. They resemble\r\nshort sections of the wall and ditch, and suggest the notion of\r\nsentry posts, or signal or alarm stations.\r\n\r\n“Within the work are several low, irregular mounds, all of which are\r\nflat on the top, except «k», which is basin-shaped, the concavity\r\nbeing about two feet deep by fifteen across. Excavations, at any\r\npoint around these mounds, disclose ashes, [p111] charcoal, and\r\nsooty earth; the charcoal is of oak-wood and very bright. Abundant\r\nfragments of the black pottery, glazed inside, and so common in this\r\nregion, are found in and around this work. At the time of my visit,\r\nI found several arrow-heads and a wedge-shaped stone. A few years\r\nago a carved pipe was found here and a piece of heavy metal, which\r\nwas tested for gold and afterwards mislaid. Inasmuch, however, as\r\nthe Indians lately occupied this ground in great numbers for several\r\nyears, these minor relics may be regarded as having pertained to them.\r\n\r\n“The bluffs around this work are of extraordinary height for this\r\nregion, and the whole position seems well designed for defence.\r\nThe regularity and apparent «freshness» of the structure, and its\r\ncorrespondence, in some striking respects, to our modern system of\r\ndefence, almost induce me to ascribe to it an European origin. This\r\nsupposition is further favored by the well known fact that Hernando\r\nde Soto passed through here, and probably erected works at various\r\npoints.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3.—“This work is situated on the left bank of Clear creek,\r\nnear Mount Sylvan, Lafayette county, Mississippi. It occupies a high\r\npoint of land, overlooking the creek bottom; upon the right is a\r\nbluff bank, forty feet high; towards the north the ground is somewhat\r\nbroken, and upon the left it slopes gradually to a hollow. There are\r\nno hills or elevated points commanding the work within a mile or\r\nmore. The ground within the enclosure is level.\r\n\r\n“The structure itself is quadrangular in form, and consists of a\r\nslight embankment of earth, about three feet high by thirty feet\r\nbroad at the base, and twelve feet broad on the top. It has no ditch,\r\nexterior or interior to the embankment, although upon «both sides»\r\nthere are evidences of the removal of the earth, leaving slight\r\ndepressions, as shown in the section. At the gateway G, the original\r\nlevel of the ground is preserved. Various forest-trees are growing\r\nupon the walls, consisting of black oak and hickory,—some of the\r\noaks are upwards of eighteen inches in diameter. At the foot of the\r\nbluffs, to the right of the work, are numerous and copious springs of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“There are no mounds within the enclosure; although there are two a\r\nlittle way outside of the walls, occupying the positions indicated\r\nin the plan.[78] The one nearest the gateway, number 1, has trees\r\ngrowing upon it, twenty inches in diameter. Fragments of pottery\r\nare scattered in abundance upon and around it. Mound number 2 I\r\nhave carefully examined. It is situated upon sloping ground, and is\r\nperhaps one foot high on the upper, and three feet on the lower side,\r\nby twenty feet base. In the centre is a regular concavity one foot\r\ndeep and twelve feet across; and in this respect it is different\r\nfrom any I have elsewhere observed. The first excavation was made\r\nupon the lower side, where were found several [p112] arrows, a\r\nhuman skeleton, (a mature subject,) and a large quantity, nearly a\r\nhalf bushel, of coarse pottery. It is of the same kind with that\r\nso abundant in the Clear creek valley, where it would be easy to\r\nfill a cart in a day. None of the vessels were whole; and I may\r\nhere remark that I have not been able to recover any of the pottery\r\nentire,—all, not excepting the clay pipes, are invariably broken.\r\nAmong the fragments of pottery was found a piece of hard-burned clay,\r\nresembling in form a sweet potato, split longitudinally. The next\r\nexcavation was made in the centre or lowest part of the concavity\r\nabove mentioned. The removal of the vegetable accumulation disclosed\r\na layer of yellow clay, four inches thick; beneath which, and nearly\r\nupon the original level of the earth, was found a hard-burned\r\nstratum, perfectly black, and apparently mingled with ashes. It\r\nwas with difficulty broken up. Beneath this hearth was a spongy\r\nunstratified mass, in which, to the depth of six inches, were mingled\r\nfragments of earthenware. Beyond this, nothing was discovered. There\r\nwere no traces of bones upon the hearth, and but few fragments of\r\npottery. Large trees are growing upon this mound.\r\n\r\n“Mound number 3 is about four feet high, and is situated upon the\r\ncreek bottom, not far from the stream. I opened it nearly a year\r\nsince. About two feet from the surface was found the skeleton of\r\na child, much decayed, and unaccompanied by remains of any sort.\r\nA little below the surface was found a stone tool, resembling a\r\ncarver’s flesh knife, and a leaden ounce bullet. There is much\r\npottery upon and around this mound; but little, if any, within it.\r\nIt was not thoroughly excavated; but so far as examined there were\r\ndiscovered no traces of fire,—it being, in this respect, peculiar.\r\nEvery other mound which I have investigated has been found to contain\r\nashes and charcoal.”\r\n\r\nWhether either of the works above described had a military origin\r\nis sufficiently doubtful; although the last named has some of the\r\ncharacteristics of a work of defence. There is nothing, however, in\r\nits position or structure so different from hundreds of other works\r\nas to warrant us in assigning to it a later date or a different\r\norigin. As a military work, it is vastly inferior to many with which\r\nwe are acquainted, and its regularity is not sufficiently marked to\r\nentitle it to any special consideration on that account. It clearly\r\nbelongs to that great family of remains, of which so many examples\r\nhave already been presented. Throughout the entire field of their\r\noccurrence, these maintain certain characteristic features, some of\r\nwhich are well exhibited in the particular work here mentioned.\r\n\r\nHad Hernando de Soto erected one tenth of the works which have been\r\nascribed to him, in the States bordering the Gulf, in Tennessee, and\r\neven in Kentucky, he must have found ample demands on his time and\r\nexertions. It is most likely, however, that the intervals between\r\nhis tedious and toilsome marches were occupied more profitably, if\r\nnot less laboriously, than in the erection of vast earth structures\r\nof this description; which, when finished, could not possibly have\r\nserved him any useful purpose. His handful of weary followers\r\nprobably found in a small stockade of logs a better defence, and one\r\nmore obviously within their capabilities of construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above plans, Mr. Morris has kindly communicated\r\naccounts of several other interesting works; of none of which,\r\nhowever, he was able to [p113] make surveys. One of these is\r\nsituated three miles east of Panola, Mississippi, and closely\r\nresembles No. 3, Plate XXXVIII. It is accompanied by several\r\nremarkable mounds. A few miles south-east of Delta there is a square\r\nenclosure of some twenty acres area. It contains several mounds, one\r\nof which is forty feet in height, truncated, and ascended by a graded\r\nway. Within this enclosure there is also a square excavation, fifteen\r\nfeet deep, and one hundred feet in diameter. It is surrounded by a\r\nlow embankment of earth, three feet in height.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXVIII. No. 4.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, PRAIRIE JEFFERSON, LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nThis group of ancient works occurs on Prairie Jefferson, Moorhouse\r\nparish, Louisiana. They are minutely described by Prof. C. G.\r\nFORSHEY, in a letter to Prof. Silliman of New Haven, published, with\r\nthe accompanying plan, in the American Journal of Science and Arts,\r\nvol. xlix. p. 38. For some interesting facts in addition to this\r\naccount, acknowledgment is due to Dr. HARRISON, proprietor of the\r\nplantation upon which these remains are situated.\r\n\r\nThe works, consisting of a series of mounds and terraces, accompanied\r\nby lines of embankment and by excavations, are found near the\r\nsouth-western portion of the prairie, and partly in what is now\r\nwoodland, though probably at no very remote date free from forests.\r\nThe mounds are disposed with some degree of regularity in respect to\r\neach other, and are of the following dimensions:\r\n\r\n             length,  width,  height,\r\n              feet     feet    feet\r\n A. base,      180      135      48\r\n A. summit,     51       45\r\n B. summit,    210       75       5\r\n C. base,      132      132       4\r\n D. summit,    120      120       4\r\n E. summit,     60       42      10\r\n\r\n                length,  length,  length,  length,\r\n                 feet     feet     feet     feet\r\n                 front    rear     wide     high\r\n F. on summit,     60       78       42       12\r\n G. on summit,     60       39       51       12\r\n H. on summit,     60       60       54        7\r\n I. on summit,     36       27       45       10\r\n\r\nThe embankment between E and F is one hundred and thirty-five feet\r\nlong, fifteen feet broad at the base, and four high. The embankment\r\n«j k l» is ten hundred and fifty feet long, twelve feet broad and\r\nfrom one to three feet high.\r\n\r\nThe great mound E has been denominated “the Temple.” It has a level\r\narea on its summit fifty-one feet long and forty-five broad, which is\r\nreached from the west by the winding graded path X. All its angles\r\nare much rounded; still its four faces are very plainly marked. Since\r\nit has been cleared of trees, several [p114] slides have marred\r\nits symmetry. These slides, as also excavations made in it, have\r\nshown that it consists of a series of strata or tables, one above\r\nthe other, each surmounted by a burned surface, resembling rude\r\nbricks. No bones have been found in it. Any extended examination of\r\nits contents is avoided, from a desire to preserve its proportions.\r\nFrom the summit a good view may be had of the surrounding works and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe mounds which face the “Temple” on the west have great uniformity\r\nof figure and dimensions, and are highest in the rear, except E and\r\nI, which are nearly level on top. E, F, H, and I, have terraces in\r\nfront; and all incline gently to the plain, which exhibits marks of\r\nexcavation. In the rear and on the sides they are for the most part\r\nvery abrupt. The pond in the rear is evidently artificial, and formed\r\nby removing the earth for building purposes. Extending around this\r\npond are an embankment and ditch, («j k l»,) the latter produced by\r\nthe excavation of the earth for the embankment, which seems to have\r\nconstituted a sort of levée around the pond to the high grounds at\r\n«j» and «l».\r\n\r\n“The mounds C, D have great similarity in their magnitude, form,\r\nand general position in respect to the “Temple;” but situated, as\r\nthey are, in cultivated fields, their definite outlines are fast\r\ndisappearing. B, however, differs essentially from the other mounds\r\nof the system; it is perfectly level on its summit, of gentle\r\ndeclivity and moderate height, and has been fitly chosen as the site\r\nof a dwelling-house, which fronts the area surrounded by the mounds.\r\n\r\n“The several ponds have outlets for the water at particular points,\r\nwhich were probably controlled as the mound-builders desired.\r\nThe long embankment («m n o») is abruptly cut off at «o», but is\r\ncontinued again towards «p», diminishing in magnitude as the land\r\ngrows higher, until it almost disappears at «s». The swale or low\r\nstrip of ground which borders this embankment on the left, continues\r\nup to very near the pond at «s», but has no actual connection with\r\nit. It does not appear that the large pond, within this grand levée,\r\nis artificial. The smaller ones, however, were manifestly produced by\r\nthrowing up the earth around them, as at «m n»; «s»; «t u», and «v w».\r\n\r\n“The necessity for these artificial ponds is apparent from the fact,\r\nthat there are no streams or supplies of water nearer this prairie\r\nthan five miles. Hence the excavations, usually made without apparent\r\ndesign in constructing the mounds, are at this place so economized\r\nas to produce the ponds in the immediate neighborhood. Here the\r\nconformation of the ground, which is gently undulating, rendered it\r\neasy to construct large ponds or lakes, to contain a perennial supply\r\nof water. This has plainly been the object of the extensive levées or\r\nembankments traced in the map. The general inclination of the land is\r\nsouthward, and the drains in its surface were with some skill called\r\ninto aid.”\r\n\r\nA similar mode of retaining a supply of water has already been\r\nremarked, in the case of a fortified hill, in Ohio. (See page 15.)\r\nThe ancient inhabitants of Central America resorted to the same\r\nmethod. Their «aguadas», lined with pavements and enclosed by\r\nembankments, are among the most interesting remains of ancient art.\r\n[p115]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXIX. Ancient Monuments, Madison Parish, Louisiana.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XXXIX.\r\n ANCIENT MONUMENTS, MADISON PARISH, LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying plans are from original surveys made by JAMES HOUGH,\r\nEsq., of Hamilton, Ohio, for Mr. MCBRIDE, and may, it is believed, be\r\nrelied upon as entirely accurate, in every essential respect.[79]\r\n\r\nThe group here presented is situated upon the right bank of Walnut\r\nBayou, in Madison Parish, Louisiana, seven miles from the Mississippi\r\nriver. It consists of seven large and regular mounds, and a graded\r\nor elevated road-way half a mile in length. The plan exhibits the\r\nrelative positions of the remains and their predominating features,\r\nand obviates the necessity of a particular description, which at best\r\nwould be intricate and obscure.\r\n\r\nThe largest mound of the group, A, is distant two hundred and fifty\r\nyards south from the «bayou», which here extends in a direction\r\nnearly east and west. The principal structure is two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet long, by one hundred and sixty-five feet broad at\r\nthe base, and thirty feet in height. The summit is level, presenting\r\nan area of one hundred and twenty feet long, by seventy-five broad.\r\nOn the side next the «bayou» towards the north, at the height of ten\r\nfeet, is a terrace ten feet wide and extending the entire length\r\nof the mound. On the south side is a road-way twenty feet wide,\r\ncommencing at a point sixty feet from the base of the mound, and\r\nleading with a regular grade to its top. At either end of the mound\r\nis an inclined platform or «apron», seventy-five feet long by sixty\r\nwide. These are six feet in elevation at the point joining the mound,\r\nbut decline gradually to three feet at the outer ends, where they\r\nterminate abruptly.\r\n\r\nB is a mound similar to the one just described, but less in size. It\r\nis one hundred and eighty feet long, one hundred and twenty broad,\r\nand fifteen high. The level area on the top is one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet long and sixty wide. A graded road leads to its summit from the\r\nnorth. At the east end is an inclined platform, seventy feet long by\r\nsixty broad, eight feet high where it joins the mound, and sloping\r\nto five feet at its outer extremity. At the west end is a similar\r\nelevation one hundred and twenty feet long by sixty broad.\r\n\r\nC is a singular work, consisting of a central mound ninety-six feet\r\nsquare at the base, and ten feet high, with a level area forty-eight\r\nfeet square on the top. Connected by elevated terraces with this\r\nmound, are two others of similar construction, [p116] each sixty\r\nfeet square and eight feet high. The terraces are forty feet broad,\r\nfour high, and one hundred and twenty-five and seventy-five feet long\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe character and dimensions of the remaining mounds are sufficiently\r\nindicated in the plan. There is however another singular structure\r\nconnected with the group, which deserves special notice. It consists\r\nof a terrace extending due west from the principal mound above\r\ndescribed, parallel to the «bayou». It is elevated three feet above\r\nthe general level of the plain, and is seventy-five feet wide by\r\ntwo thousand seven hundred feet in length. Upon either side of this\r\nterrace, and parallel to it, are broad excavations, at present about\r\nthree feet deep. These excavations are not far from two thousand\r\nfeet long, by from one hundred and fifty to three hundred feet wide.\r\nThere are no other perceptible excavations in the vicinity; and it is\r\nreasonable to conclude that most, if not all of the material for the\r\nconstruction of the works was taken from these points.\r\n\r\nThe ground occupied by these remains is for the most part under\r\ncultivation. It was originally covered with a heavy growth of the\r\nblack walnut, a species of timber scarcely known on the alluvial\r\nlands of the Mississippi, so far south. It was first cleared by a\r\nMr. Harper, in 1827. Broken pottery is found in abundance around\r\nthese monuments; and fragments of human bones, much decomposed, are\r\nobserved intermixed with the earth. Upon the mounds, in many places,\r\nthe earth is much burned. There are no other remains of magnitude in\r\nthe immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe works here represented, Fig. 22, are situated in Bolivar county,\r\nMississippi, near Williams’s «bayou» in the Choctaw bend, one mile\r\nand a half from the Mississippi river. They consist of two truncated\r\npyramidal structures of the character already described, accompanied\r\nby two small conical mounds, the whole surrounded by a circular\r\nembankment of earth, without a ditch, two thousand three hundred\r\nfeet in circumference, and four feet high. A gateway opens into the\r\nenclosure from the east. Mound A is one hundred and fifty feet square\r\nat the base, seventy-five feet square on top, and twenty feet high,\r\nwith a graded ascent from the east. B is one hundred and thirty-five\r\nfeet square at base, fifty feet at top, and fifteen feet high. The\r\nascent in this instance is from the north. The two small conical\r\nmounds are about thirty feet in diameter, and five feet high. The\r\nsides of the pyramidal structures do not vary two degrees from the\r\ncardinal points [p117] of the compass; a feature not observed in any\r\nof the others above noticed. They all, however, appear to have been\r\nplaced with some reference to these points,—probably as near as they\r\ncould be located without instruments.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Washita, Tenza, and Catahoola rivers in\r\nLouisiana, is a most remarkable group of ancient remains, of which\r\nno plan has yet been published. They have nevertheless been often\r\nreferred to, and are described as consisting of a number of mounds,\r\nsome rectangular and others round, embraced within a large enclosure\r\nof not far from two hundred acres area.[80] The principal mound is\r\nsaid to be circular, four hundred feet in diameter at the base,\r\nninety feet in height, truncated, and having a level area at its\r\nsummit, fifty feet in diameter. The summit is reached by a spiral\r\npathway, which winds with an easy ascent around the mound, from\r\nits base to its top. This pathway is sufficiently broad to permit\r\ntwo horsemen to ride abreast. From the summit a wide prospect is\r\ncommanded. Here, upon penetrating the earth to a slight depth, strong\r\ntraces of fire are visible. The ground upon which the mound stands\r\nis somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain, which is low and\r\nmarshy.[81]\r\n\r\nThe great mound at Seltzertown, near Washington, Mississippi, is one\r\nof very singular construction. It consists of a truncated pyramid six\r\nhundred feet long by about four hundred broad at its base, covering\r\nnearly six acres of ground. Its sides correspond very nearly with the\r\nfour cardinal points, its greatest length being from east to west. It\r\nis forty feet in perpendicular height; and is surrounded [p118] by\r\na ditch at its base, of variable dimensions, but averaging perhaps\r\nten feet in depth. It is ascended by graded avenues. The area on the\r\ntop embraces about four acres. Near each of the ends, and as nearly\r\nas may be in the longitudinal centre of the elevation, is placed\r\na large conical mound. The one towards the west is represented to\r\nbe not far from forty feet in height, and truncated, with a level\r\narea at its summit of thirty feet diameter. The opposite mound is\r\nsomewhat less in size, and is also truncated. Eight other mounds are\r\nregularly placed at various points; they are of comparatively small\r\nsize, measuring from eight to ten feet in height. The ground here is\r\nconsiderably broken; and it has been supposed by some, from the fact\r\nthat it slopes in every direction from the base of the monument, that\r\nthe structure is simply a natural elevation modified and fashioned\r\ninto its present form by the hands of man.[82] Human bones have been\r\nexposed by the washing away of the sides of this structure.\r\n\r\nThe above examples, it is believed, may be taken as very fair\r\nillustrations of the general form and external characteristics of\r\nthe Southern monuments. There are no perfect pyramids. With the\r\nexception of a portion, probably the larger portion, of the conical\r\nmounds, which are abundant, but overshadowed by the more remarkable\r\nstructures which surround them, «all» appear to be truncated, and to\r\nhave, in most instances, graded ascents to their tops. As already\r\nremarked, they do not seem to have been connected with any military\r\nsystem,—their form and structure, so far as developed, pointing to a\r\nreligious origin. Some have been noticed as having parapets raised\r\non their summits, as if to protect the area in case of assault; and\r\nhence it has been concluded that the larger elevations were “forts”\r\nor citadels. This feature was observed in many of the Teocalli\r\nof the Mexicans. It is possible that they may have been designed\r\nsecondarily for defence. That the Mexicans fought with the greatest\r\ndetermination around the bases of their temples, from their terraces\r\nand their summits, we have abundant evidence in the records of the\r\nconquerors. However well these elevations may have served for places\r\nof retreat in case of sudden attack, it is obvious that they were\r\nin no wise adapted to resist anything like a regular siege or a\r\ncontinued investment. The absence of sources for procuring water,\r\nand the narrow compass to which the besieged must necessarily be\r\nlimited, seem sufficient in themselves to [p119] successfully combat\r\nthis hypothesis. The defensive works on the Ohio, on the contrary,\r\npossess all the requisites for resisting an enemy and for sustaining\r\na protracted defence.\r\n\r\nWe must seek therefore in the contents, as well as in the form and\r\nposition of these works, for the secret of their origin and purposes.\r\nAnd it is at this stage of our inquiry, that the lack of a systematic\r\nand extended investigation, conducted on philosophical principles,\r\nis most sensibly felt. Some of these structures, it is stated, where\r\ntheir formation is disclosed by slides or the wasting action of the\r\nrivers, exhibit alternate layers or «platforms» of earth and burned\r\nclay, from base to summit. Others are represented as having alternate\r\nlayers of earth and human bones in various stages of decomposition.\r\nAnd others still, we are assured, have various horizontal strata of\r\nearth and sand, upon which are deposited at various points human\r\nremains, implements, pottery, and ornaments. Many of the remains of\r\nart exhibit great skill in their construction, more especially the\r\npottery and articles of similar composition. The conical mounds, so\r\nfar as we are informed, have many features in common with those of a\r\nhigher latitude. How far the coincidences between them may be traced\r\ncan only be settled by future inquiries.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been presented above, it will readily be seen that it\r\nis impossible, with our present limited knowledge concerning them,\r\nto form anything like a determinate or satisfactory conclusion\r\nrespecting the numerous and remarkable remains of the South. The\r\nimmense mounds that abound there may be vast sepulchres in which\r\nthe remains of generations were deposited; they may have been the\r\ntemples and “high places” of a superstitious people, where rites\r\nwere celebrated and sacrifices performed; or, they may have answered\r\nas the places of last resort, where, when pursued by foes, the\r\nancient people fled to receive the support of their gods and to\r\ndefend the altars of their religion. Perhaps all of these purposes\r\nwere subserved by them. What significance may attach to their form;\r\nwhether there exists any dependence between their exterior features\r\nand their contents; the dates of the different deposits found in\r\nthem; indeed, whatever of design and system which these works may\r\nhave possessed, and how far they may serve to reflect light upon the\r\ncharacter and customs of the people who built them, their religion,\r\ntheir modes of burial, and their arts,—«all» remain to be determined\r\nby careful and systematic investigation, conducted with a view to\r\ndevelop facts rather than to excite wonder. Such an investigation\r\nmust also finally determine whether these are the remains of the same\r\npeople whose works are scattered through the more northern States,\r\nand whether they were probably contemporaneous in their origin;\r\nand, if the works are of the same people, and not contemporaneous,\r\nwhether the course of migration was southward or the reverse; whether\r\nthe less imposing structures of the Ohio are the remains of a ruder\r\nand more warlike but progressive people, or the weaker efforts of\r\na colony, pressed by foes and surrounded by difficulties. It may\r\ndisclose the curious and important fact, that upon the Ohio and\r\nMississippi first originated those elements which afterwards, in a\r\nregular course of progress, developed themselves in the gorgeous\r\nsemi-civilization of Mexico and Peru. Or it may, on the contrary,\r\nmake known the no less interesting fact, that from these centres\r\nradiated colonies, which sustained [p120] themselves for a period,\r\nand finally disappeared, leaving perhaps only a few modified remnants\r\nin the region bordering upon the Gulf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the preparation of the foregoing pages for the press,\r\nand at too late a date to permit the introduction, in another\r\nconnection, of the facts it embodies relating to the aboriginal\r\nmonuments of the South, a manuscript work on the Southern Indians, by\r\nWILLIAM BARTRAM, was placed in the hands of the investigators, by Dr.\r\nMorton, of Philadelphia. The character and history of this MS. have\r\nbeen sufficiently explained in the Preface, to which the reader is\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nAs already observed, it relates principally to the manners, customs,\r\ngovernment, and religion of the Muscogulges and other southern Indian\r\ntribes; but it also embraces many interesting and important facts\r\nrespecting the remains under consideration. Taken in connection with\r\nthose presented by the same author in his “Travels in North America,”\r\nthey serve very much to explain the character and illustrate the\r\nsecondary if not the primary purposes to which the southern monuments\r\nwere applied. The accompanying illustrations are reduced fac-similes\r\nof Bartram’s original pen sketches. In introducing them he observes,\r\nin language somewhat quaint but forcible:\r\n\r\n“The following rough drawings of the ancient Indian monuments,\r\nconsisting of public buildings, areas, vestiges of towns, etc., will\r\nserve to illustrate what I have elsewhere said respecting them. They\r\nare, to the best of my remembrance, as near the truth as I could\r\nexpress. However, if I have in any respect erred, I hope my mistakes\r\nmay be corrected by the observations of future and more accurate\r\nand industrious travellers. But as time changes the face of things,\r\nI wish they could be searched out and faithfully recorded, before\r\nthe devastations of artificial refinements, ambition, and avarice,\r\ntotally deface these simple and most ancient remains of the American\r\naborigines.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“CHUNK YARDS.—The ‘Chunk Yards’ of the Muscogulges or Creeks are\r\nrectangular areas, generally occupying the centre of the town. The\r\nPublic Square and Rotunda, or Great Winter Council House, stand at\r\nthe two opposite corners of them. They are generally very extensive,\r\nespecially in the large, old towns: some of them are from six hundred\r\nto nine hundred feet in length, and of proportionate breadth. The\r\narea is exactly level and sunk two, sometimes three, feet below the\r\nbanks or terraces surrounding them, which are occasionally two in\r\nnumber, one behind and above the other, and composed of the earth\r\ntaken from the area at the time of its formation. These banks or\r\nterraces serve the purpose of seats for spectators. In the centre of\r\nthis yard or area, there is a low, circular mound or eminence, in\r\nthe middle of which stands erect the ‘Chunk Pole,’ which is a high\r\nobelisk or four-square pillar declining upwards to an obtuse point.\r\nThis is of wood, the heart or inward resinous part of a sound pine\r\ntree, which is very [p121] durable. It is generally from thirty to\r\nforty feet in height, and to the top is fastened some object which\r\nserves as a mark to shoot at, with arrows or the rifle, at certain\r\nappointed times. Near each corner of one end of the yard, stands\r\nerect a less pole or pillar, about twelve feet high, called a ‘Slave\r\nPost,’ for the reason that to them are bound the captives condemned\r\nto be burnt. These posts are usually decorated with the scalps of\r\nslain enemies, suspended by strings from the top. They are often\r\ncrowned with the white dry skull of an enemy.\r\n\r\n“It thus appears that this area is designed for a public place of\r\nexhibition, for shows, games, etc. Formerly, there is little doubt,\r\nmost barbarous and tragical scenes were enacted within them, such as\r\nthe torturing and burning of captives, who were here forced to run\r\nthe gauntlet, bruised and beaten with sticks and burning chunks of\r\nwood. The Indians do not now practise these cruelties; but there are\r\nsome old traders who have witnessed them in former times. I inquired\r\nof these traders for what reason these areas were called ‘«Chunk\r\nYards»;’ they were in general ignorant, yet, for the most part,\r\nconcurred in a lame story that it originated in the circumstance of\r\ntheir having been places of torture, and that the name was but an\r\ninterpretation of the Indian term designating them.\r\n\r\n“I observed none of these yards in use in any of the Cherokee towns;\r\nand where I have mentioned them, in the Cherokee country, it must\r\nbe understood that I saw only the remains or vestiges of them among\r\nthe ruins of ancient towns. In the existing Cherokee towns which I\r\nvisited, although there were ancient mounds and signs of the yard\r\nadjoining, yet the yard was either built upon or turned into a garden\r\nplat, or otherwise appropriated. Indeed I am convinced that the Chunk\r\nYards now or lately in use among the Creeks are of very ancient date,\r\nand not the work of the present Indians; although they are now kept\r\nin repair by them, being swept very clean every day, and the poles\r\nkept up and decorated in the manner I have described.\r\n\r\n“The following plan, (Fig. 23,) will illustrate the form and\r\ncharacter of these yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n“A. The great area, surrounded by terraces or banks.\r\n\r\n“B. A circular eminence, at one end of the yard, commonly nine or\r\nten feet higher than the ground round about. Upon this mound stands\r\nthe great «Rotunda», «Hot House», or «Winter Council House» of the\r\npresent Creeks. It was probably designed and used by the ancients who\r\nconstructed it, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n“C. A square terrace or eminence, about the same height with the\r\ncircular one just described, occupying a position at the other end of\r\nthe yard. Upon this stands the «Public Square».\r\n\r\n“The banks enclosing the yard are indicated by the letters «b b b b»;\r\n«c» indicates the ‘«Chunk Pole»,’ and «d d» the ‘«Slave Posts».’\r\n[p122]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the square, instead of being open at the ends, as shown in\r\nthe plan, is closed upon all sides by the banks. In the lately built\r\nor new Creek towns, they do not raise a mound for the foundation of\r\ntheir rotundas or public squares. The yard, however, is retained, and\r\nthe public buildings occupy nearly the same position in respect to\r\nit. They also retain the central obelisk and the slave posts.\r\n\r\n“In the Cherokee country, all over Carolina and the northern and\r\neastern parts of Georgia, wherever the ruins of ancient Indian\r\ntowns appear, we see always, besides these remains, one last,\r\nconical, pointed mound. To mounds of this kind I refer, when I speak\r\nof «pyramidal mounds». To the south and west of the Altamaha, I\r\nobserved none of these, in any part of the Muscogulge country, but\r\nalways flat circular or square structures. The vast mounds upon\r\nthe St. John’s, Alachua, and Musquito rivers, differ from those\r\namong the Cherokees, with respect to their adjuncts and appendages,\r\nparticularly in respect to the great highway or avenue, sunk below\r\nthe common level of the earth, extending from them, and terminating\r\neither in a vast savannah or natural plain, or an artificial pond or\r\nlake. A remarkable example occurs at Mount Royal, from whence opens a\r\nglorious view of Lake George and its environs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\n“Fig. 24 exhibits a view of the great mound last referred to. Fig.\r\n25 is a plan of the same structure with its accompanying avenue,\r\nwhich leads off to an artificial lake or pond, on the verge of an\r\nexpansive savannah or natural meadow. A, the mound, about forty feet\r\nin perpendicular height; B, the highway leading from the mound in\r\na straight line to the pond C, about half a mile distant. What may\r\nhave been the motive for making this pond I cannot conjecture, since\r\nthe mound and other vestiges of the ancient town are situated close\r\non the banks of the river St. Juan.[83] It could not therefore be\r\nfor the conveniency of water. Perhaps they raised the mound with\r\nthe earth taken out of the pond. The sketch of this mound also\r\nillustrates the character of the mounds in the Cherokee country; but\r\nthe last have not the highway or avenue, and are always accompanied\r\nby vast square terraces [p123] placed upon one side or the other. On\r\nthe other hand, we never see the square terraces accompanying the\r\nhigh mounds of East Florida.”\r\n\r\nFrom the above quotations it appears that, less than one century ago,\r\na portion of the monuments of the South were in actual use by the\r\nIndians. It will be observed, however, that our authority ascribes\r\ntheir construction to an anterior race and assigns to them a high\r\nantiquity. In his Travels he remarks that the region in which they\r\nare most abundant, lying between the Savannah and Ockmulgee rivers\r\non the east and west, and between the sea-coast on the south and\r\nthe Apalachian mountains on the north, was occupied subsequently\r\nto the arrival of Europeans, by the Cherokees, who were afterwards\r\ndispossessed by the Creeks; that “all this country was probably, many\r\nages preceding the Cherokee invasion, inhabited by a single nation\r\nor confederacy governed by common laws, possessing like customs, and\r\nspeaking the same language, but so ancient that neither the Creeks\r\nnor the Cherokees, nor the nations they conquered, could render any\r\naccount by whom or for what purposes these monuments were erected.”\r\nHe nevertheless inclines to the belief, and not without reason, that\r\nthe uses to which these structures were appropriated, by the existing\r\nIndian tribes, were not widely different from those for which they\r\nwere originally constructed. Upon this point he adds: “The mounds\r\nand large areas adjoining them seem to have been raised in part for\r\nornament and recreation, and likewise to serve some other public\r\npurpose, since they are always so situated as to command the most\r\nextensive prospect over the country adjacent. The square terraces may\r\nhave served as the foundations of fortresses; and perhaps the great\r\npyramidal mounds answered the purpose of look-outs, or were high\r\nplaces for sacrifice.”[84]\r\n\r\nWhatever date or origin we may ascribe to these monuments, we cannot\r\noverlook the singular attachment to the square and the circle\r\nexhibited by the Creeks in the public edifices known to have been\r\nconstructed by themselves. That these forms had some significance\r\nat the outset can hardly be doubted, although their perpetuation\r\nmay have depended upon custom. The circumstance that the eternal\r\nfire was only maintained in the circular structure, designated by\r\nBartram as the “Rotunda,” goes far to support the conclusion that\r\nits form was symbolical, and referred to the sun. That these tribes\r\nwere sun worshippers is well known: the inferences drawn from analogy\r\nare therefore sustained by collateral facts. In their less imposing\r\nstructures, may we not discern the type of the great circles and\r\nsquares of Ohio,—the traces of a system of idolatry which has dotted\r\nthe valleys of the West with giant temples, symbolizing in their form\r\nthe nature of the worship to which they were dedicated?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[74] The inability to add very largely to our stock of information\r\nrespecting the monuments of the Southern United States, is less a\r\nmatter of regret, since it is ascertained that Dr. M. W. DICKESON of\r\nPhiladelphia, whose researches in natural science have created no\r\nlittle interest, has devoted much of his time to their investigation.\r\nHis inquiries have been conducted on a large scale, and will serve to\r\nreflect much new light upon our antiquities. It is to be hoped the\r\npublic will soon be put in possession of the results of his labors.\r\n\r\n[75] Most of the accounts of the monuments of the South met with in\r\nvarious works, treating directly or incidentally of our antiquities,\r\nare derived from Bartram, whose animated descriptions of those which\r\nfell under his notice are not always easily recognised, in the\r\nvarious forms under which they are presented. Near the conclusion of\r\nhis work, he sums up his observations in this department as follows:\r\n\r\n“The pyramidal hills or artificial mounds, and high ways or avenues\r\nleading from them to artificial lakes or ponds, vast tetragon\r\nterraces, ‘chunk yards,’ and obelisks or pillars of wood, are the\r\nonly monuments of labor, ingenuity and magnificence, that I have seen\r\nworthy of notice or remark. The region lying between the Savannah\r\nriver and Ockmulgee, east and west, and from the sea-coast to the\r\nCherokee or Apalachian mountains, north and south, is the most\r\nremarkable for these high conical hills, tetragon terraces, etc.\r\nThis region was possessed by the Cherokees since the arrival of the\r\nEuropeans, but they were afterwards dispossessed by the Muscogulges;\r\nand all that country was probably many ages preceding the Cherokee\r\ninvasion inhabited by one nation or confederacy, who were ruled by\r\nthe same system of laws, customs, and language, but so ancient that\r\nthe Cherokees, Creeks, or the nation they conquered, could render no\r\naccount for what purposes these monuments were raised. The mounts\r\nand cubical yards adjoining them seem to have been raised in part\r\nfor ornament and recreation, and likewise to serve for some other\r\npublic purpose, since they are always so situated as to command the\r\nmost extensive prospect over the country adjacent. The tetragon\r\nterraces seem to be the foundations of fortresses; and perhaps the\r\ngreat pyramidal mounts served the purposes of look-out towers and\r\nhigh places for sacrifice. The sunken area called by white traders\r\nthe ‘chunk yard’ very likely served the same conveniency that it has\r\nbeen appropriated to by the more modern and even present nations of\r\nIndians, that is, the place where they burnt or otherwise tortured\r\ntheir captives that were condemned to die; as the area is surrounded\r\nby a bank, and sometimes two of them, one behind and above the other,\r\nas seats to accommodate the spectators at such tragical scenes, as\r\nwell as at the exhibition of shows, dances, and games. From the river\r\nSt. Juan’s, southwardly to the point of the peninsula of Florida,\r\nare to be seen high pyramidal mounts, with spacious and extensive\r\navenues, leading from them out of the town, to an artificial lake\r\nor pond of water: these were evidently designed for ornament or\r\nmonuments of magnificence to perpetuate the power and grandeur of the\r\nnation; and not inconsiderable neither, for they exhibit scenes of\r\npower and grandeur, and must have been public edifices.”—«Travels in\r\nNorth America», p. 518.\r\n\r\n[76] From the Rafinesque MSS. The scale on which the plan is drawn\r\nis not given. It is probably about five hundred feet to the inch. An\r\naccount of this work, substantially the same with that given by Prof.\r\nRAFINESQUE, was published by Mr. E. CORNELIUS, in Silliman’s Journal,\r\nvol. i. p. 223. Mr. Cornelius was accompanied in his visit by several\r\nIndian chiefs, who, he says, “gazed upon the remains with as much\r\ncuriosity as any white man. I inquired,” continues Mr. C., “of the\r\noldest chief, if the natives had any tradition concerning them; to\r\nwhich he answered in the negative. I then requested each to say what\r\nhe supposed was their origin. Neither could tell; but all agreed in\r\nsaying, ‘They were never put up by our people.’”\r\n\r\n[77] Western Messenger.\r\n\r\n[78] The notices of these mounds, although falling with more\r\npropriety within the scope of the chapter on “«Mounds»,” can hardly\r\nbe omitted from the above connection. It will shortly be seen that\r\nthe mound first described (number 2 of the plan) probably belongs\r\nto the class of altar or sacrificial mounds, or those which were\r\nconnected with the superstitions of the builders. The human remains\r\nfound in that, as in mound number 3, were, most likely, deposited\r\nsubsequent to their erection. It is not impossible that the mound\r\nlast named is of a later date than those upon the higher ground.\r\n\r\n[79] The perfect regularity which the plans exhibit, it will readily\r\nbe understood, does not actually exist. The angles of all these\r\nstructures are more or less rounded. The predominant features,\r\nnevertheless,—the terraces, platforms, and graded ways,—are truly\r\nrepresented. All of these works seem to have been originally moulded\r\nwith the utmost care, and possessed the highest degree of regularity\r\nof which the materials were capable. They were undoubtedly faced with\r\nturf, which seems better than solid masonry to resist the ravages of\r\ntime and the elements.\r\n\r\n[80] Stoddard, in his History of Louisiana, p. 349, gives an account\r\nof some works near the junction of the Washita, Acatahoola, and\r\nTenza, probably the very ones in question. His account is subjoined:\r\n\r\n“Not less than five remarkable mounts are situated near the junction\r\nof the Washita, Acatahoola, and Tenza, in an alluvial soil. They are\r\nall enclosed in an embankment, or wall of earth, at this time ten\r\nfeet high, which contains about two hundred acres of land. Four of\r\nthese mounds are nearly of equal dimensions, about twenty feet high,\r\none hundred broad, and three hundred long. The fifth seems to have\r\nbeen designed for a tower or turret; the base of it covers an acre of\r\nground; it rises by two stages or steps; its circumference gradually\r\ndiminishes as it ascends; its summit is crowned by a flattened cone.\r\nBy admeasurement the height of this tower is found to be eighty feet.\r\nPerhaps these works were designed in part for defence, and in part\r\nfor the reception of the dead.”\r\n\r\nThere is a slight discrepancy in the dimensions of these works, as\r\ngiven by Prof. Rafinesque and Mr. Stoddard. Both agree, however,\r\nrespecting their vast size, and general character.\r\n\r\n[81] This monument is not singular. Mounds with spiral pathways are\r\nfrequent at the South, and are occasionally found at the North.\r\nBartram describes one on the Savannah river in Georgia:—“These\r\nwonderful labors of the ancients stand in a level plain near the bank\r\nof the river. They consist of conical mounds of earth and four square\r\nterraces, etc. The great mound is in form of a cone, about forty or\r\nfifty feet high, and the circumference of its base is two or three\r\nhundred yards; it is entirely composed of the loamy rich earth of the\r\nlow grounds; the top or apex is flat; a spiral path or track leading\r\nfrom the ground up to the top is still visible: there appear four\r\nniches excavated out of the sides of this hill, at different heights\r\nfrom the base, fronting the four cardinal points; these niches or\r\nsentry-boxes are entered into from the winding path, and seem to have\r\nbeen meant for resting-places or look-outs.”—«Bartram’s Travels in N.\r\nAmerica», p. 323.\r\n\r\nThe «niches» here mentioned have been occasionally observed in\r\nMississippi and Louisiana, placed at right angles in respect to\r\neach other, and not always, though sometimes, corresponding to the\r\ncardinal points. It has been suggested that they were designed as\r\nrecesses for idols, or places where altars were erected. It seems\r\nlikely that proper investigation would throw light upon this point.\r\n\r\n[82] Breckenridge’s View of Louisiana, «Appendix». Mr. J. R.\r\nBARTLETT, in a recent Memoir on the “Progress of Ethnology,”\r\npresents, on the authority of Dr. M. W. DICKESON, some new facts\r\nrespecting this mound. “On digging into it, vast quantities of human\r\nskeletons were found; also numerous specimens of pottery, including\r\nvases filled with pigments, ashes, ornaments, etc. The north side\r\nof the mound is supported by a wall of «sun-dried bricks», two feet\r\nthick, filled with grass, rushes, and leaves. A shaft has been\r\nsunk in the mound to the depth of forty-two feet, without reaching\r\nthe original soil.” Dr. DICKESON also mentions angular tumuli, the\r\ncorners of which “were quite perfect, formed of large bricks, bearing\r\nthe impression of the human hand.” We have the same authority for\r\nthe fact that the great enclosure at the “Trinity” in Louisiana,\r\nwhich contains one hundred and fifty acres, “is partially faced with\r\nsun-dried bricks.” Also that ditches and ponds are sometimes found,\r\nin the same State, “lined at the bottom and sides with bricks.” These\r\nbricks are stated to be from sixteen to eighteen inches in length,\r\nand of proportionate breadth.\r\n\r\n[83] The remains here described are referred to in Bartram’s\r\npublished travels as follows: “They are situated upon an eminence,\r\nnear the banks of the lake, and command an extensive and charming\r\nprospect of the waters, islands, east and west shores of the lake,\r\nthe capes, the bay, and Mount Royal; and to the south the view is in\r\nlike manner infinite, where the skies and waters seem to unite. On\r\nthe site of this ancient town stands a very pompous Indian mount, or\r\nconical pyramid of earth, from which runs in a straight line a grand\r\navenue or Indian highway through a magnificent grove of magnolias,\r\nlive oaks, palms, and orange trees, terminating at the verge of a\r\nlarge green level savannah.”—«Travels». p. 101.\r\n\r\n[84] Travels in North America, p. 518.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p124]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.\r\n MONUMENTS OF THE NORTH-WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that the ancient monuments of the\r\nSouthern United States, although partaking of the general character\r\nof those of the central region, are nevertheless in many respects\r\npeculiar. While enclosures are comparatively few, mounds are\r\nabundant and of great size and symmetry, and possess a regularity\r\nof arrangement which we look for in vain among the corresponding\r\nstructures of a higher latitude. Proceeding to the North and\r\nNorth-west, we find the earthworks assuming a new form and character,\r\nin many respects so unlike those both of the central and southern\r\ndivisions of the country, that we are almost induced to assign them\r\na different origin. As at the South, there are few enclosures or\r\nworks of defence; but, instead of regular pyramidal structures, the\r\nmounds generally assume the shape of animals, presenting a thousand\r\nsingular forms and combinations. These effigies are situated upon the\r\nundulating prairies and level plains, and are accompanied by conical\r\nmounds and occasional lines of embankment; but the latter, except in\r\na very few instances, have no obvious design, and enter into none of\r\nthe combinations which we notice in the works of the Ohio valley. The\r\ninteresting field occupied by these remains has not fallen within\r\nthe range of the investigations of the authors, who are therefore\r\nunable to present much that is new respecting them; still, it will be\r\nnecessary to embody the facts thus far disclosed in a general manner,\r\nin order to an adequate comprehension of the scope and character of\r\nour antiquities. And here, at the outset, we have again to regret the\r\nsmall amount of information respecting these works in possession of\r\nthe public, as well as its unsatisfactory nature, resulting from the\r\nnecessarily limited and disconnected observations of those who have\r\npaid any attention to the subject. These observations have been made\r\nby men of inquiring minds, in the scanty intervals of professional\r\nbusiness, and are consequently too detached to justify or sustain\r\nany general conclusions. They have served rather to excite than to\r\ngratify curiosity, and in this way they may have the good effect of\r\nleading to a full and careful survey of the entire field.\r\n\r\nThe first public notice of the existence of these singular relics\r\nat the North-west, was made by RICHARD C. TAYLOR, Esq., in the\r\n“American Journal of Science and Art,” for the month of April,\r\n1838. His paper, which was accompanied by several illustrations,\r\nattracted considerable attention, and was followed, in the same\r\nJournal for 1843, by a more extended account, very well illustrated,\r\nfrom the hand of S. TAYLOR, Esq. A later notice by Prof. JOHN LOCKE\r\nconstituted a short chapter in the “Report on the Mineral Lands\r\nof the United [p125] States,” presented to Congress in 1840 and\r\npublished in 1844. These, with a few unsatisfactory notices in the\r\npublic prints, comprise the only sources of information which we\r\npossess; and from them the following facts are mainly derived.\r\n\r\nThe field in which these remains occur, so far as observed by\r\nthe above authorities, is embraced within the lower counties of\r\nWisconsin, and extends from Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi, by\r\nthe way of the Wisconsin and Rock rivers, eastward towards Fond du\r\nLac on Lake Winnebago, and Milwaukie on Lake Michigan. The country\r\nthus indicated is about one hundred and fifty miles in length by\r\nfifty in width. The great Indian trail or “war path,” from Lake\r\nMichigan near Milwaukie to the Mississippi above Prairie du Chien,\r\nwhich has for the most part been adopted as the route of the United\r\nStates military road, passes through this chain of earthworks. They\r\nare found in abundance by the sides of this great natural pathway,\r\nwhich has been for ages and must for ever remain the route of\r\ncommunication between the Great Lakes and the Great River. They occur\r\nprincipally in the vicinity of the large water-courses, observing\r\nin this respect a marked conformity with the remains of other\r\nsections, and are invariably placed above the influence of freshets\r\nor inundations. Like those of the Ohio valley, they are seldom found\r\nupon hilly or sterile lands, but mainly upon the rich undulating\r\nplains, or on the levels corresponding to the alluvions of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThey consist of elevations of earth, of diversified outline and\r\nvarious size, for the most part constituting effigies of beasts,\r\nbirds, reptiles, and of the human form; but often circular,\r\nquadrangular, and of oblong shape. The circular or conical tumuli\r\ndiffer from those scattered over the whole country in no outward\r\nrespect, excepting that they are much smaller in their average\r\ndimensions; the largest seldom exceeding fifteen feet in height.\r\nThose in the form of parallelograms are sometimes upwards of five\r\nhundred feet in length, seldom less than one hundred; but in height\r\nthey bear no proportion to their otherwise great dimensions, and may\r\nprobably be better designated as walls, embankments, or terraces,\r\nthan mounds. These works are seldom isolated, but generally occur in\r\ngroups or ranges, sometimes, though not always, placed with apparent\r\ndesign in respect to each other. In these groups may be observed\r\nevery variety of form,—the circular, quadrangular, and animal-shaped\r\nstructures occurring in such connection with each other as to fully\r\njustify the belief that they are of contemporaneous origin. At first\r\nglance, these remains are said to resemble the sites or ground-plans\r\nand foundation-lines of buildings; and it is not until their entire\r\noutline is taken into view, that the impression of an effigy becomes\r\ndecided. This is not surprising, in view of the fact that they are\r\nusually of inconsiderable height, varying from one to four feet; in a\r\nfew cases, however, rising as high as six feet. Their outlines are,\r\nnevertheless, represented to be distinctly defined in all cases where\r\nthey occupy favorable positions. Their small altitude should cause no\r\ndoubt of the fidelity of the representations which have been made of\r\nthese figures; since a regular elevation of six inches can be readily\r\ntraced upon the level prairies and “bottom-lands” of the West,\r\nespecially when it is covered with turf. The following illustrations,\r\nselected from those presented by the authorities above mentioned,\r\nwill serve to explain the character of [p126] these remains. It\r\nis to be regretted that explanatory sections do not accompany the\r\nplans, so as to exhibit, at one view, the altitude as well as general\r\noutlines and dimensions of the figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XL.\r\n ANCIENT MONUMENTS, DADE COUNTY, WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThis group of mounds is figured and described from actual survey,\r\nby Mr. R. C. TAYLOR.[85] It occurs about eighteen miles west of the\r\n“Four Lakes,” and seven miles east of the “Blue Mounds,” in Dade\r\ncounty, Wisconsin. It is situated on the Great Indian Trail already\r\nnoticed, and consists; as will be observed, of effigies of six\r\nquadrupeds, six mounds in the form of parallelograms, one circular\r\ntumulus, one effigy of the human figure, and a small circle. The\r\narea comprehended in the map is something less than half a mile in\r\nlength. The dimensions of the figures and their relative positions\r\nare indicated in the plan. It is not easy to make out, from the\r\neffigies, the character of the animals intended to be represented. It\r\nhas been suggested that they were designed to represent the buffalo,\r\nwhich formerly abounded in the vicinity; but the absence of a tail\r\nand of the characteristic hump of that animal would seem to point\r\nto a different conclusion. They display a closer resemblance to the\r\nbear than to any other animal with which we are acquainted. These\r\nfigures seem to be most prevalent; and, though preserving about the\r\nsame relative proportions, vary in size from ninety to one hundred\r\nand twenty feet. In many other places, as at this point, they occur\r\nin ranges, one after the other at irregular intervals. In the midst\r\nof this group is the representation of a human figure, placed with\r\nits head towards the west, and having its arms and legs extended. Its\r\nlength is one hundred and twenty-five feet, and it is one hundred\r\nand forty feet from the extremity of one arm to that of the other.\r\nThe body is thirty feet in breadth, the head twenty-five feet in\r\ndiameter, and its elevation considerably greater than that of most of\r\nthe others, being not much less than six feet. The human figure is\r\nnot uncommon among the effigies, and is always characterized by the\r\nextraordinary and unnatural length of its arms. The conical mound in\r\nthe centre of this group is the most elevated work, and commands a\r\nview of the entire series. These works are situated upon a high open\r\nprairie, on the dividing ridge between the waters of the Rock and\r\nWisconsin rivers. Half a mile westward of this remarkable group, and\r\non the same elevated prairie, occurs a solitary mound, about ninety\r\nfeet in length, representing an animal in all respects like those\r\njust described, but lying with its head towards the south-west. [p127]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XL. Ancient Monuments Seven Miles East of the Blue\r\nMounds, Dade Co. Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLI.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.

Enlarged Plan of Mound A, Group No. 1, on This Plate, Showing\r\nthe Method of Survey.]\r\n\r\n“Along the space of twenty miles from this position,” observes Mr. R.\r\nS. Taylor, “extending to the Four Lakes eastward, similar monuments,\r\nintermixed with plain tumuli, are seen at almost every mile, in the\r\nlowest situations as well as crowning the highest swells of the\r\nprairies; and they are still more numerous all around those beautiful\r\nbut almost unknown lakes. It would be a ceaseless repetition of\r\nsimilar forms to figure many of these.”\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XLI.\r\n ANCIENT WORKS, DADE COUNTY, WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1.—This group is figured both by Mr. R. C. TAYLOR and Prof.\r\nLOCKE, whose plans agree with great exactness. It occurs ten miles\r\nwest of Madison, Dade county, Wisconsin. The old Indian trail, now\r\nthe military road, runs between the nose of one animal and the tail\r\nof the other. They lie on the borders of an undulating prairie, at\r\nthe edge of the woodland, upon a gentle slope. A short distance (five\r\nhundred or six hundred feet) to the west of them is a natural swell\r\nof ground, with an artificial circular tumulus on the top of it,\r\noverlooking the two figures. No. 3 on the same Plate illustrates the\r\nmethod of survey adopted by Prof. Locke, and also gives an enlarged\r\nplan of the more perfect figure of the group.[86] These effigies are\r\nthe favorite resort of badgers, which, finding them raised and dry,\r\nhave selected them for their burrows. Mr. Taylor suggests that these\r\nfigures were intended to represent the fox. Prof. Locke, on the other\r\nhand, remarks that “they have an expression of agility and fleetness,\r\nand may have been intended to represent the cougar or American tiger,\r\nan animal still existing in that region.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2.—This group of works closely resembles that last described.\r\nOne of the effigies (C) was opened by Prof. Locke. “It was composed\r\nof sand without any change to mark the original surface, although it\r\nis now overgrown with grass and covered with a thin black mould. The\r\nwhole of the descent near the bottom of which the figure lies, has\r\nevidently been formed from the disintegration of the sandstone bluff\r\ncontiguous; and at the time of the formation of this tumulus, it was\r\nmost probably destitute of loam at this point, as it now is at a\r\npoint nearer [p128] the bluff. A section of the embankment, near the\r\ngap, exhibited a thin line of loam, even with what might be supposed\r\nto have been the surface of the ground. Alluvial stratification is\r\npositive proof that a formation is not artificial; but the absence of\r\na base of mould is not proof of the same thing, for the surface of\r\nthe earth may have been removed before the erection of the mound. In\r\nexamining the tumuli of Wisconsin, I did not at any place discover\r\na ditch or cavity from which the earth to construct them had been\r\ntaken. They are uniformly raised from a smooth surface, always above\r\ninundation, and guarded from temporary currents produced by showers.\r\nThe backs of the effigies are uniformly placed up hill.”\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XLII.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1.—This group of works is sufficiently well explained by\r\nthe Plate itself. It is situated about two miles from the group\r\nlast described, on the road to Madison. The large figure in the\r\nsupplementary plan is about two thousand feet south-west of the\r\nembankment represented in the plan. “It appears to be solitary;\r\nlies on a low, level ground; and seems to be mutilated. If intended\r\nto represent an animal, the head is evidently too large, and the\r\nattitude stiff and rectangular.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2.—This singular group of works is situated upon section\r\ntwo, township eight, near the north bank of Wisconsin river, one\r\nand a half miles west of the principal meridian, Richland county,\r\nWisconsin. It is minutely described by Mr. S. TAYLOR. The figures\r\ncomposing the group are so arranged as to constitute a sort of\r\nenclosure of about half an acre area, which Mr. Taylor terms the\r\n“citadel.” The ground is here prominent; to the north, south,\r\nand west of the embankments it has a graded descent; to the east\r\nit spreads into a broad plateau, upon which, as well as to the\r\nsouthward, are numerous other embankments of various forms and\r\ndimensions. From the top of the principal mound, occupying the centre\r\nof the group, and within four hundred yards to the westward, may\r\nbe seen at least a hundred elevations similar to those forming the\r\nboundaries of the “citadel.” “The elevation of these embankments\r\ngenerally is no more than «thirty inches», and of the lesser mounds\r\ntwenty inches, while the altitude of the large mound overlooking the\r\nwhole group is ten feet. Exterior to the group, upon the east and\r\nnorth-east sides, excavations from which the earth had been removed\r\nare plainly indicated; and it was here, no doubt, that a portion of\r\nthe material composing the structures was obtained. Notwithstanding\r\nthe rank growth of vegetation upon these works, and the probability\r\nthat they have been much reduced from their original height, the\r\nangles and terminations are quite visible. Near the north-east part\r\nof the group, part of the embankment appears to have been destroyed.”\r\n[p129]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLII.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Group of Remains, Ten Miles East of the Blue Mounds, Dade Co.\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Group of Works, North Bank of Wisconsin River, Richland Co.\r\nWisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLIII. Ancient Works\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Grant Co. Wisconson.\r\n\r\nNos. 2–13. Various Localities.]\r\n\r\nThe supplementary section, A, exhibits the excavation made by Mr.\r\nTaylor in the large central mound. “A shaft was sunk about midway\r\nfrom the top to the bottom of the mound. At the depth of eight feet\r\nthe original sod was reached; it here assumes a different appearance\r\nfrom that which it possesses at the exposed surface, is hard and\r\ncompact, resembling what is technically denominated ‘hard pan,’\r\ncaused perhaps by the pressure of the superincumbent earth. The\r\nmound is composed of ferruginous sand; and as it is free from any\r\nadmixture, and is destitute of any appearance of stratification,\r\nit must have been built at one time, and not by contributions at\r\nintervals. The original sod is here about six inches thick; beneath\r\nit is the regular stratification of the plain. A shaft was carried\r\nalong the original level for the space of fourteen feet, and some\r\ndistance beyond the centre of the mound; but no remains of any kind\r\nwere discovered.”\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XLIII.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1.—This interesting group of remains is situated in the\r\nvillage of Muscoda, (English Prairie,) Grant county, Wisconsin. It\r\nis described as follows, by Mr. S. TAYLOR: “The late cultivation\r\nof these grounds has in a measure obliterated these works, many of\r\nthem being in the streets and commons; and the village in its future\r\nincrease may destroy them entirely. In the group are three figures in\r\nthe form of a cross [bird?]; in the centre of the largest of them is\r\na depression, perhaps caused by an Indian «caché». The outlines of\r\nthe various figures are easily traced, although their elevation at\r\nthis time does not exceed thirty inches. From the excavations around\r\nmany of them, it is apparent that they must have been constructed\r\nwith materials obtained adjacent to them. Some of these mounds\r\nhowever seem to have successfully resisted the abrasions of time;\r\nthose towards the south-western portion of the group are six feet\r\nin height. The distance, from one to the other of the group here\r\nrepresented, is about four hundred and sixty yards. The site is a\r\nbeautiful arenaceous loam, free from trees and shrubbery, so that a\r\nview of the entire group is commanded from the summit of some of the\r\nmore prominent mounds. Human bones have been found in many of these.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2 is situated on the north-east part of Sec. 35 N., and is\r\nwithin a mile of the Wisconsin river. It occupies an eminence, and\r\nis the centre of a group of mounds, fifteen in number, extending\r\nthe distance of three hundred yards, and placed at intervals of\r\nabout twenty-five feet apart. “It appears to have been originally\r\nconstructed as represented by the dotted lines, having at those\r\npoints an elevation of about three feet. Additional earth seems then\r\nto have been heaped upon the head and breast, elevating those points\r\nto the height of six feet.” [p130]\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3 occurs about a mile to the westward of group No. 1, just\r\ndescribed. “It represents a human figure having two heads, which\r\ngracefully recline over the shoulders. It is well preserved. The\r\narms are disproportionately long; their full length is not exhibited\r\nin the plan for want of room. The various parts of the figure\r\nare gracefully rounded; the stomach and breast are full and well\r\nproportioned. DIMENSIONS.—«Widths»: from one arm-pit over the breast\r\nto the other, twenty-five feet; over arm at shoulders, twelve, and\r\ntapering to four feet at the extremities; over hips, twenty; over\r\nlegs, near the body, eight, and tapering to five; over figure above\r\nthe shoulders, fifteen; over each neck, eight; over the heads,\r\nten. «Lengths»: of body, fifty feet; arms, one hundred and thirty;\r\nneck and heads, fifteen. «Elevations»: of breast, shoulders, and\r\nabdomen, thirty-six inches; arms at the junction of the shoulders,\r\nsame height, diminishing towards their extremities to ten inches;\r\nthe thighs near the trunk are twenty, at the feet but ten inches in\r\nheight.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 4 lies about four miles west of the village of Muscoda. It may\r\nhave been intended to represent a bird, a bow and arrow, or the human\r\nfigure. In the forest near this work are extensive groups of ancient\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 5 is situated on the Wisconsin river, east of the fourth\r\nprincipal meridian. The length of this figure is one hundred and\r\nfifty feet; elevation three feet. Mr. S. Taylor suggests that it is\r\nintended to represent the frog; it approaches nearer the form of a\r\nturtle. There are other works of a similar shape near by; also some\r\nin the form of a cross, mammillary mounds, and parallelograms.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 6 occurs near group No. 1 of this plate. “It seems to have\r\nbeen intended to represent some fleet animal. It is one hundred feet\r\nin length, and eighteen inches high.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 7 is found not far from that last described, and is supposed\r\nby Mr. Taylor to represent the turtle. It is seventy-six feet in\r\nlength, and its greatest height is thirty inches. It is a common\r\nfigure in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 8 was situated in Richland county, Wisconsin. Mr. Taylor\r\nthinks it was intended to represent a bear. It was fifty-six feet\r\nlong, and twenty inches high. It has lately been destroyed by the\r\npassage of a road over it.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 9 occurs in the vicinity of No. 2, and is the terminating\r\nfigure of the series of which that is the centre. Earthworks of this\r\nform are common in Richland county.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 10, near Blue river, English Prairie; length eighty-four feet,\r\nheight six feet; supposed to represent a bear.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 11 is found near No. 4. It is very perfect in outline;\r\nseventy-nine [p131] feet long, and twenty-four broad. “Throughout\r\nthis region,” observes Mr. S. Taylor, “embankments of this form are\r\nvery numerous: some have two parallel projections from the back\r\nof the head; in the present case they seem to be so blended as to\r\nrepresent but one.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLIV. Ancient Work\r\n\r\nNo. 1. On Rock River, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNos. 2–8. Various Localities.]\r\n\r\nNUMBER 12, one mile from the English Prairie, represents, according\r\nto Mr. S. Taylor, “a species of mounds which, under various\r\nmodifications, are very numerous, comprising about one fifth of the\r\nembossed works of the region in which it occurs. The elevation of the\r\nfigure, as well as of the group of which it forms a part, is about\r\nfour feet. Between the base of the trunk and the southern wing, is a\r\nmound twenty-one feet in diameter, and five feet high.” Supposed to\r\nrepresent a bird with wings partially expanded.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 13, designated the “horned bird” by Mr. Taylor, is situated in\r\nthe county of Grant, upon S. 16, T. 8, R. 1, W., where an extensive\r\ngroup of several hundreds may be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XLIV.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1.—The only enclosure in Wisconsin at all resembling those of\r\na lower latitude, or which seems to partake of a defensive character,\r\nis situated upon the west branch of Rock river, township seven, of\r\nrange fourteen east, in the Milwaukie land district. It is known as\r\nthe city or ruins of Aztalan. Several brief notices of this work have\r\nappeared in the public prints; the only account, however, which is\r\nat all satisfactory, was communicated, together with an illustrative\r\nmap, by Mr. S. Taylor, to the American Journal of Science and Arts,\r\nin 1843.\r\n\r\nThis work, although possessing several features peculiar to itself,\r\nhas others closely resembling those that characterize the works\r\nbordering the Gulf. It is described as situated in a beautiful\r\nrolling country, conveniently interspersed with timber, and watered\r\nby Rock river and its tributaries. It is said to consist of a “brick\r\nwall” five feet high by twenty-five feet base, enclosing an area of\r\ntwenty acres, and having the general outline of an oblong square.\r\nUpon three sides the wall is interrupted, at intervals of from two\r\nto five rods, by «bastions» of the same height as the main wall, and\r\nextending seventeen feet beyond it. The inner wall, extending along\r\nthe bank of the river, is much lighter than those upon the remaining\r\nsides, and is destitute of the singular feature last mentioned.\r\nWithin this enclosure are a number of truncated pyramids, forty or\r\nfifty feet square upon the top, and between fifteen and twenty in\r\nheight. Two of these are connected with each other by an elevated\r\nway, after the manner of some of the Mississippi and Louisiana\r\nstructures. (See Plate XXXIX.) Two parallel ways or embankments are\r\ncarried longitudinally, nearly the whole length of the enclosure.\r\nSeveral [p132] conical mounds are mentioned in the description\r\nas occurring within the enclosure, but do not appear in the plan.\r\nQuite a number occur just exterior to the walls, some of which are\r\nrepresented to be of large size. Covering the south-west angle is a\r\ncrescent-form work of considerable extent, which also has bastions\r\nat intervals throughout its length. A cellar and stairway within\r\none of the square mounds, and a subterranean passage «arched with\r\nstone», are mentioned as existing here; but they lack confirmation\r\nand deserve little credit.\r\n\r\nThe walls, which are described as being built of «brick», are\r\ncomposed of clay, probably burned on the spot. Whether they are\r\nburned throughout, has not yet been ascertained, and can only be\r\ndetermined by removing a section of the wall. It will doubtless be\r\nfound that the burning is superficial, resulting from the combustion\r\nof some wooden superstructure, or from design. We shall be warranted\r\nin ascribing the use of burned bricks to the race which built these\r\nworks, only upon the most conclusive evidence, and such we do not\r\nat present possess.[87] The walls of many of the enclosures in the\r\nScioto valley appear to have been slightly burned. (See page 28.)\r\n\r\nThe plan of the work presented by Mr. Taylor is palpably an imperfect\r\none. No gateways or entrances are represented, nor is the scale upon\r\nwhich the work is laid down exhibited,—omissions which would not be\r\nlikely to occur in a plan made after accurate survey. A complete map\r\nand description of this work, such as its singular character merits,\r\nis a desideratum.\r\n\r\nThis is the only work with projections partaking of the character\r\nof bastions, which has fallen under notice, and is in this respect\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThat these projections were designed to subserve the purposes to\r\nwhich bastions are applied in modern fortification is not clear.\r\nThe object of the bastion is to enfilade the wall of the defence,\r\nso as to preclude an enemy from approaching it or carrying on his\r\noperations under its shelter. Hence they are placed at such intervals\r\nas may easily be swept or commanded by the weapons in use; the\r\ndistance of a bow-shot apart would therefore be adequate to all the\r\npurposes for which their erection is required. So far from this being\r\nthe case in the work under notice, it appears that they are placed at\r\nthe short intervals of from thirty to eighty feet. This circumstance,\r\nthough not conclusive on the point, would seem to indicate that they\r\nwere not constructed for the purpose which we should be apt at first\r\nglance to assign to them.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2.—“Among the various works of antiquity in this region,”\r\nobserves Mr. S. Taylor, “those in the form of men are numerous. This\r\nfigure forms one of an extensive series of these works, of various\r\nshapes, situated upon S. 35, T. 9, R. 1, W. of 4th M., in the margin\r\nof a forest, and is covered with large trees. It is truly a giant,\r\nmeasuring from the extremity of one arm to that of the other, [p133]\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-nine feet, and from the top of the head to\r\nthe end of the trunk, one hundred and eleven feet. Its shoulders,\r\nhead, and breast, are elevated four feet. In the centre of the breast\r\nis quite a depression, probably once used as a place of concealment\r\nfor provisions by the French, called a «caché». About a mile to the\r\nnorth of this figure is another of human shape and like magnitude,\r\naccompanied by a large group of works. Among them is a large mound\r\ntwo hundred feet in circumference, and fifteen in height.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3.—This group occurs upon the English Prairie, within the\r\nlimits of Iowa county, Wisconsin. “In the vicinity of these are\r\nmany other figures of various forms and dimensions. To the eastward\r\ncommences a series of mammillary mounds, varying from one to two and\r\na half feet in height. They are beautifully and with much regularity\r\narranged at intervals, and extend to the distance of about fifteen\r\nhundred feet, terminating abruptly in a mound eighteen feet in\r\nheight, and two hundred and twenty-five in circumference. To the\r\nnorth and south of the figures, and parallel with them, are numerous\r\nembankments with passage-ways through them.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 4.—This group is also situated in the vicinity of English\r\nPrairie. But half of the figures are represented; the remainder are\r\nof the same forms, supposed to represent birds.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 5.—“The site of this remarkable work is upon an eminence, near\r\nEagle Mills, Richland county, Wisconsin. It seems to be a combination\r\nof two figures, one representing the buffalo, perhaps, and the other\r\na man. Immediately to the south-west, and within twenty feet of the\r\nhead of this figure, commences a series of mounds, mostly conical.”\r\n\r\nNUMBER 6 is near Blue river, English Prairie. Its outlines are very\r\ndistinct; probably designed to represent the otter or a lizard.\r\nFigures of the kind are quite common.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 7 is in the village of Muscoda, county of Grant. Its length is\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-four feet; height thirty inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nThere are many rectangular and some circular figures in addition to\r\nthe animal-shaped effigies of which so many examples have been given.\r\nFig. 26 represents the manner in which they are often combined. This\r\nexample is from the great group on the English Prairie. Individual\r\nfigures might be multiplied, but enough have been presented to\r\nconvey a general idea of the character of these singular monuments.\r\nA complete survey of the field of their occurrence might disclose a\r\ndependence between the various groups, and go far towards explaining\r\nthe mystery of their origin and purposes. [p134]\r\n\r\nSome of these mounds have been excavated and found to contain human\r\nremains in all parts, while the excavations in others have been\r\nattended with no such developments. Those examined by Prof. Locke\r\nand Mr. S. Taylor revealed no deposits. Mr. R. C. Taylor mentions\r\nthat twelve mounds, near Red Bank on the Fox river, were opened in\r\n1837, and found to contain human bones in a very advanced stage of\r\ndecomposition. One of the mounds was an animal-shaped structure,\r\none hundred and fifty feet in length. The position of the skeletons\r\nindicated that the bodies had been placed upon the original\r\nsurface previous to being heaped over. There were no appearances\r\nof excavation beneath the surface in any of the interments. It may\r\nbe suggested that the human remains found in these mounds were\r\ndeposited by the existing tribes of Indians, a suggestion which\r\nderives great force from the fact that both the Messrs. Taylor concur\r\nin representing that many of the Indians to this day bury in these\r\nstructures, conceiving that they were originally designed for that\r\npurpose, although they possess no tradition respecting their origin.\r\nSome of the Indians, on the other hand, express the belief that the\r\nmounds in the form of animals were made by the “«Great Manitou»,” and\r\nare indicative of a plentiful supply of game in the world of spirits.\r\nAt any rate, they are regarded with reverence by all the Indians, and\r\nare never disturbed by them, except for purposes of sepulture.\r\n\r\nProceeding upon the assumption that they were designed as\r\nburial-places, Mr. R. C. Taylor ingeniously suggests that their\r\nforms were intended to designate the cemeteries of the respective\r\ntribes or families to which they belonged: thus, the tribe, clan, or\r\nfamily possessing as its characteristic «totem», blazon, or emblem,\r\nthe Bear, constructed the burial-place of its members in the form of\r\nthat animal; the clans having the Panther, Turtle, Eagle, or other\r\nanimal or object for their «totems», respectively conforming to the\r\nsame practice. Upon this hypothesis we can readily conceive the\r\nancient inhabitant to have possessed the same anxiety to be buried\r\nin his family tomb which we see exhibited at this day, among our own\r\npeople, “to rest in the sepulchres of their fathers.” Mr. Taylor\r\ndiscreetly remarks, however, that there is no evidence to show that\r\nany existing tribes of Indians ever erected such monuments, but that,\r\non the contrary, they acknowledge the profoundest ignorance of their\r\norigin. He advances the suggestion only as a plausible conjecture, in\r\nthe absence of any satisfactory solution of the problem, which still\r\nremains unsolved.\r\n\r\nWhat significance may attach to the fact that they occur mainly\r\non the great lines of traverse between the Mississippi and Lake\r\nMichigan, or to the further fact that most if not all of these groups\r\nhave one or more conical mounds so placed as to command a view of\r\nthe remainder, it is not undertaken to say.[88] That similar works\r\nare found in the central and western portions of Michigan, as [p135]\r\nwell as in Wisconsin, we have the assurance of witnesses whose\r\nstatements are entitled to full credit. Whether they are identical\r\nwith those noticed above is unknown; their character remains to be\r\nascertained.[89] The few animal effigies found in Ohio, and of which\r\nan account has already been given, seem to have few features in\r\ncommon with those of the North-west, and probably, in their purposes,\r\nadmit of less doubt. We cannot venture to assign a similar origin to\r\nthe latter,—certainly not, until we are in possession of more facts\r\nconcerning them, whereon to base our conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe absence of enclosures, or works of defence, (such as are found in\r\ngreat numbers in the Ohio valley,) in connection with these animal\r\neffigies, has been noticed in a preceding page. It appears that the\r\neffigies themselves, accompanied by short, low lines of embankment,\r\nare sometimes so arranged as nearly to enclose certain areas; whether\r\nthe arrangement resulted from design or accident is not however very\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nSuch is the extent of our knowledge respecting the monuments of\r\nWisconsin. Carver mentions earthworks in the vicinity of Lake\r\nPepin; and it is reasonable to conclude that they are scattered,\r\nin greater or less profusion, over the intervening territory. Of\r\nthis, however, we are still uninformed. It would be an interesting\r\npoint to determine the range of the mound effigies, and whether they\r\nmerge gradually into the works of a lower latitude, or whether they\r\noccupy an exclusive field, and possess characteristics sufficiently\r\nstriking to warrant us in ascribing them to a different race or era.\r\nTheir purposes, in our present state of information concerning them,\r\ndo not seem to be satisfactorily settled: it is still a matter of\r\ndoubt whether they are sepulchral in their origin, connected with\r\nthe superstitions of their builders, or erected as the monuments and\r\nmemorials of migrations and events unrecorded by the pen of history.\r\nCertain it is that they are now invaded by a busy population,\r\ncareless alike of their origin and of their future fate, before whose\r\nencroachments they are rapidly disappearing. Already the plough has\r\nbroken in upon the outlines and symmetry of hundreds, and unless the\r\npresent favorable moment is seized upon to secure their accurate\r\nadmeasurement and delineation, these embossed illustrations of our\r\nancient history will be obliterated forever. It is impossible to\r\nestimate their value in the elucidation of the grand ethnological\r\nproblems involved in the past history of our country, until their\r\nextent and dependencies as well as their general character are better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Missouri, and especially in the country lying\r\nbetween the Missouri and Arkansas rivers, various singular remains\r\nare represented to exist, which differ materially from those that\r\nhave been noticed in the preceding pages. [p136] These are said to\r\nconsist of the ruins of towns, sometimes of great size, regularly\r\nlaid out, in streets and squares. Dr. BECK mentions one of these\r\nruined towns in Gasconade county, (probably now falling within the\r\ncounty of Crawford, erected out of Gasconade,) in which the sites\r\nof houses, possessing foundations of stone, are distinctly visible.\r\nStone walls are said to occur in some parts of the area, covered by\r\nheaps of earth.[90] The same author describes several works of stone\r\ndisplaying, in his estimation, great architectural skill, which occur\r\non Osage river and Buffalo creek, one of its tributaries. One said to\r\nexist on Noyer’s creek, near the town of Louisiana, Pike county, has\r\nbeen particularly noticed. “It presents the dilapidated remains of\r\na building constructed of rough, unhewn stones, fifty-six feet long\r\nand twenty-two broad, embracing several divisions and chambers. The\r\nwalls are from two to five feet high. Eighty rods eastward of this\r\nstructure is found a smaller one, of similar construction. The narrow\r\napartments are said to be arched with stone, one course overlapping\r\nthe other, after the manner of the edifices of Central America.”[91]\r\nNothing of this character has been observed elsewhere, and it is\r\nextremely probable that there is some mistake in the matter. If\r\nworks answering to this description really exist, at the points\r\nmentioned, they deserve the careful attention of the archæologist.\r\nIt is suspected that they will not bear a rigid scrutiny, such as\r\nis required to a proper substantiation. Our authority observes,\r\nthat “these remains form a class of antiquities entirely distinct\r\nfrom the walled towns, fortifications, barriers, or mounds; and\r\nthat the regularity and other peculiarities of structure which they\r\ndisplay, favor the conclusion that they are the remains of a race\r\ndifferent from those who erected the former, and who were familiar\r\nwith the rules of architecture, and perhaps with a perfect system of\r\nwarfare.”[92]\r\n\r\nI. DILLE, Esq., of Newark, Ohio, in a communication addressed to\r\nthe authors, presents the following facts respecting the remains\r\nof Missouri, which cannot fail to prove interesting in this\r\nconnection: “I have been much interested in a singular kind of\r\nantiquities found in the State of Missouri. They have been mentioned,\r\nbut not described, by various writers. They consist of small\r\ntumuli, generally raised about twelve or eighteen inches above the\r\nsurface, and have the general form of an ellipse, measuring usually\r\ntwenty-five by eighteen feet. They are very numerous, particularly\r\nupon the head waters of the St. Francis river, and are always near\r\nstreams and water-courses. I have dug into several, but never\r\nsucceeded in finding anything except coals and a few pieces of rude\r\npottery. Hence I have concluded they are the remains of mud-houses.\r\nThey are always arranged in straight lines, with broad streets\r\nintervening between them, crossing each other [p137] at right angles.\r\nIn different villages their distance apart varies, but is generally\r\nuniform in the same group. Sometimes they are as near as ten paces\r\nto each other, while in other instances they are separated twenty or\r\nthirty paces. These ruined villages are numerous in the vicinity of\r\nMine la Motte.[93] The town of Frederickton stands upon one of these\r\nsites. I have noticed in them the usual prerogative of power,—the\r\nlargest houses are always nearest the water, and the smallest most\r\ndistant. It would appear that the selection of the site was governed\r\nby the convenience of water alone; the principals taking the nearest\r\nposition to the stream. I have counted upwards of two hundred of\r\nthese mounds in a single group. Arrow-heads of jasper and agate, and\r\naxes of sienite and porphyry, have been found in these vicinities. No\r\nother remains of a remarkable character have, so far as I am aware,\r\nbeen discovered.”[94]\r\n\r\nIt may be conjectured, that the remains here mentioned are the traces\r\nof Indian villages. The Mandans, Minatarees, and some other tribes,\r\nbuilt their huts of earth, resting on a framework of wood. Previous\r\nto their erection, however, the soil was excavated to the depth of\r\nabout two feet, and the ruins of their towns are designated rather by\r\ndepressions than elevations. It is also well known that their lodges\r\nwere grouped without regularity, and close together, with just enough\r\nroom between them to permit of moving about.[95] The sites of most of\r\nthe Indian towns are only indicated by the graves in their vicinity,\r\nand by the bones and fragments of rude pottery scattered over the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nBesides these remains, there are numerous others in the valley of\r\nthe Missouri, bearing a close resemblance to those upon the Ohio\r\nand its branches. Lewis and Clarke describe a very extensive series\r\nof works, one thousand miles up the Missouri, embracing an area of\r\nabout four hundred acres. It is situated upon a peninsula formed by\r\na bend of the river, and consists of two long walls, from six to\r\nfifteen feet in height, and from seventy-five to one hundred feet\r\nbroad at the [p138] base, one of which is six thousand feet long\r\nand extends across the isthmus, the other runs along the bank of\r\nthe stream. The extremity of one of the long walls terminates in a\r\nspecies of citadel, of semi-circular shape, which has horn-works\r\nand curtains defending the gateways, and also protected ways to the\r\nriver. Here are a number of mounds and excavations similar, in all\r\nrespects, to those characterizing the defensive works generally. This\r\nwork is not entire, having evidently been greatly encroached upon by\r\nthe river, which is constantly undermining the elevated terrace upon\r\nwhich it stands. Still beyond this point, upon the Platte, Kanzas,\r\nand the numerous other tributaries of the Missouri, many large and\r\ninteresting works are said to occur.[96] They have been remarked high\r\nup the streams, in the valleys overlooked by the Rocky Mountains.\r\nBut little more than the fact of their existence is known; of their\r\ncharacter we are ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the city of St. Louis formerly existed a\r\nvery large and interesting group of works, consisting mainly of\r\na series of mounds so arranged as to constitute the sides of a\r\nparallelogram. These mounds were generally square or oblong, with\r\nlevel summits. Some were terraced, bearing a close relationship to\r\nthose in Mississippi and Louisiana. A few conical mounds occurred in\r\nconnection with them, but there was neither embankment nor ditch. All\r\nwere situated upon the second terrace.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the group is the singular work yet\r\npreserved, denominated the “Falling Garden.” This, as described by\r\nJames, consists of a succession of terraces, artificially formed from\r\nthe bank of the natural terrace, which is here upwards of fifty feet\r\nin height. The lowest of these terraces is eighty-seven feet broad by\r\none hundred and fourteen long; the second is fifty-one feet, and the\r\nthird thirty feet wide. Their slopes are regular, and the aspect of\r\nthe structure that of a Mexican teocalli of four stages.[97]\r\n\r\nStructures of brick are mentioned as occurring both in Missouri and\r\nArkansas, but their existence is not sufficiently well authenticated.\r\nThere are, without doubt, numerous remains scattered over the\r\nterritory embraced in Arkansas, Texas, and New Mexico; and it is not\r\nimpossible that their investigation would result in developing the\r\nfact that there is a gradual transition, from the earthworks of the\r\nMississippi to the more imposing structures of brick and stone of\r\nMexico and Central America.[98]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLV. Great Mound at Marietta, Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] From Silliman’s Journal of Science and Art, vol. xxxiv. p. 91.\r\n\r\n[86] The measurements of this figure are given by Prof. Locke as\r\nfollows, in feet and inches. «Triangles»: Eye to shoulder, 23 feet;\r\nshoulder to foot, 29,4; fore foot to eye, 37,8; eye to nose, 20,4;\r\nnose to shoulder, 35,10; eye to point half way between the ears,\r\n11,0; shoulder to same point, 24,10; shoulder to hip, 38,4; fore foot\r\nto hip, 57,0; shoulder to hind foot, 47,8; hind foot to hip, 28,10;\r\nhip to tip of tail, 38; hind foot to tip of tail, 41,6. «Diameters»:\r\nOf neck, 13; fore leg, 11; body, 14,7; hind leg, 9,9; tail, 8.\r\n«Distances»: Eye to front, 7,6; ear to ear, 14; shoulder to armpit,\r\n9,9; shoulder to back, 8,4; hip to rump, 7; hip to flank, 9,7; hip to\r\ninsertion of tail, 7,6; length of throat, 12 feet.\r\n\r\n[87] The authors have the assurance of a gentleman for some time\r\nconnected with the Milwaukie Land Office, and who is every way\r\nqualified to judge in the matter, that the walls are of clay,\r\nprobably only superficially burned, and possess no indications of\r\nhaving been composed of bricks. The representations to the contrary\r\nhave probably been the result of misapprehension.\r\n\r\n[88] “The choice, in selecting the sites of these monuments of\r\nancient days, appears to have been influenced mainly by their\r\ncontiguity to the lakes and principal rivers, and to those great\r\nlines of interior communication, which, from an unknown period,\r\ntraversed this country. * * * These mounds are almost invariably\r\ncontiguous to Indian paths, whose narrow but deeply-worn tracks\r\nattest their extreme antiquity and long use.”—«R. C. Taylor.»\r\n\r\n[89] No accurate account of them has yet been published; and it\r\nis, consequently, uncertain whether any bear the form of animals.\r\nThey are rather vaguely described as low elevations of considerable\r\nextent and well defined outline, somewhat resembling garden beds.\r\nMr. Schoolcraft speaks of these remains as existing in considerable\r\nnumbers on the Elkhart, St. Joseph’s, Kalamazoo, and Grand rivers.\r\nAccording to the same authority, no large tumuli or «Teocalli» occur\r\nin connection with them. Similar monuments, it will be observed, are\r\nfound in the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n[90] Beck’s Gazetteer of Missouri, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[91] Ibid. p. 306.\r\n\r\n[92] Dr. BECK also mentions another stone work, described to him by\r\nGen. Ashley, as situated upon a high cliff on the west side of the\r\nGasconade river, from whence it commands an extensive prospect. It\r\nis represented to be from twenty-five to thirty feet square; and,\r\nalthough in ruins, exhibits an uncommon degree of regularity. From\r\nthe monument leads a devious path, extending down the cliff to the\r\nentrance of a cave, in which was found a quantity of ashes.\r\n\r\n[93] Remains, similar to those here described, are abundant in\r\nPeru, where they indicate the sites of ancient towns and cities.\r\nThe streets are always easily traced, and cross each other at right\r\nangles with great regularity. “The sites of the houses or huts are\r\ngenerally marked by heaps of earth; though in some instances the\r\nwalls of the larger structures remain, in part, standing. These walls\r\nare represented to be three feet in thickness. Some of these towns\r\nare enclosed by fortifications, which have now crumbled down so as\r\nto present the simple appearance of earth embankments. The remains\r\nof one of these ancient towns, occurring midway between Truxillo and\r\nHuanchuco, cover several miles in extent.”—«Proctor.»\r\n\r\n[94] It is probable the remains here described are similar to those\r\nobserved by Lewis and Clarke, on the Missouri, some distance above\r\nthe mouth of the Platte. “At ten miles above our encampment, we\r\nexamined a curious collection of graves or mounds, on the south side\r\nof the river. Not far from a low piece of land and a pond, is a tract\r\nabout two hundred acres in extent, which is covered with mounds of\r\nvarious shapes and sizes: some of sand, and some of both earth and\r\nsand; the largest being nearest the river. These mounds indicate the\r\nposition of the ancient village of the Ottoes, before they retired to\r\nthe protection of the Pawnees.”—«Lewis and Clark», p. 26.\r\n\r\n[95] Catlin’s North American Indians, vol. i. p. 82; Breckenridge’s\r\nVoyage up the Missouri, (Views of Louisiana,) p. 248. “Imagine you\r\nsee a heap of cabins without order or design, some like cart houses,\r\nothers like tubs, built of bark, supported by posts, sometimes\r\nplastered on the outside with mud in a coarse manner; in a word built\r\nwith less art, neatness, and solidity, than the cabins of the beaver;\r\nand you have an Indian village.”—«Charlevoix’s Travels in Canada»,\r\nvol. ii. p. 127.\r\n\r\n[96] Lewis and Clarke, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[97] Views of Louisiana, p. 189; James, Expedition to Rocky\r\nMountains, vol. i. p. 314.\r\n\r\n[98] “The distance from the large mounds on the Red river to those in\r\nNew Spain is not so great, but that they may be regarded as existing\r\nwithin the same country.”—«Breckenridge».\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p139]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI.\r\n EARTHWORKS—THE MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—GROUP ILLUSTRATING THE FORMS OF THE MOUNDS.]\r\n\r\nIn connection more or less intimate with the various earthworks\r\nalready described, are the Tumuli or MOUNDS. Together, these two\r\nclasses of remains constitute a single system of works, and are\r\nthe monuments of the same people. And while the enclosures impress\r\nus with the number and power of the nations which built them, and\r\nenlighten us as to the amount of military knowledge and skill which\r\nthey possessed, as well as, in some degree, in respect to the\r\nnature of their superstitions,—the mounds and their contents, as\r\ndisclosed by the mattock and the spade, serve to reflect light more\r\nparticularly upon their customs and the condition of the arts among\r\nthem. Within these mounds we must look for the only authentic remains\r\nof their builders. They are the principal depositories of ancient\r\nart; they cover the bones of the distinguished dead of remote ages;\r\nand hide from the profane gaze of invading races the altars of the\r\nancient people.\r\n\r\nA simple heap of earth or stones seems to have been the first\r\nmonument which suggested itself to man; the pyramid, the arch, and\r\nthe obelisk are evidences of a more advanced state. But rude as are\r\nthese primitive memorials, they have been but little impaired by\r\ntime, while other more imposing structures have sunk into shapeless\r\nruins. When covered with forests, and their surfaces interlaced with\r\nthe roots of trees and bushes, or when protected by turf, the humble\r\nmound bids defiance to the elements which throw down the temple and\r\ncrumble the marble into dust. We therefore find them, little changed\r\nfrom their original proportions, side by side with the ruins of\r\nthose proud edifices which mark the advanced, as the former do the\r\nprimitive state of the people who built them. They are scattered over\r\n[p140] India; they dot the steppes of Siberia and the vast region\r\nnorth of the Black Sea; they line the shores of the Bosphorus and\r\nMediterranean; they are found in old Scandinavia, and are singularly\r\nnumerous in the British islands. In America, they prevail from the\r\ngreat lakes of the north, through the valley of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe seats of semi-civilization in Mexico, Central America, and Peru,\r\neven to the waters of the La Plata on the south. We find them also\r\non the shores of the Pacific ocean, near the mouth of the Columbia\r\nriver, and on the Colorado of California. With the character of those\r\nabroad we have little, at present, to do, except perhaps to note some\r\nof the more striking features which they exhibit in common with those\r\nof our own valley.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the number and dimensions of the\r\nmounds of the West. To say that they are innumerable in the ordinary\r\nuse of the term would be no exaggeration. They may literally be\r\nnumbered by thousands and tens of thousands. In form, as observed\r\nin a preceding chapter, they are generally simple cones, frequently\r\ntruncated and sometimes terraced. They are also elliptical,\r\npear-shaped, or of a square pyramidal form,—in the last case always\r\ntruncated, and most usually having one or more graded ascents to\r\ntheir summits. These varieties are partially illustrated in the cut\r\nat the head of this chapter, and will be amply exhibited in the pages\r\nwhich follow. No doubt can be entertained that their forms were, in\r\ngreat part, determined by the purposes for which they were designed,\r\nand may therefore be of use to us in ascertaining their character.\r\nThus, if any were designed to serve as the sites of temples, or as\r\n“high places” for the performance of religious rites and ceremonies,\r\nit is evident they would be constructed with special reference to\r\nthese objects.\r\n\r\nIn common with the enclosures, the mounds are for the most part\r\ncomposed of earth, though stone mounds are by no means rare. They\r\nare sometimes composed entirely of clay, while the soil all around\r\nthem, for a long distance, is gravel or loam. The object of this may\r\nperhaps be found in the fact that mounds composed of such materials\r\nbetter resist the action of the elements, and preserve their form.\r\nThere is certainly no difference in their position or contents which\r\nwould justify the supposition that any peculiar dependence existed\r\nbetween the material composing the mound and the purposes to which it\r\nwas devoted. Whether any significance may attach to the predominance\r\nof stone, in some of the mounds, is a question difficult to answer.\r\nIt occasionally happens that a mound of stone occurs in the midst of\r\na group composed of earth. Such was the case with one which formerly\r\nstood within the limits of Chillicothe. As a general rule, however,\r\nthe mound is composed of material found upon the spot or taken\r\nfrom pits near by; and stone mounds oftenest occur where, from the\r\nhardness of the soil or the abundance of stones, it would be easiest\r\nto construct the tumulus of the latter material.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the position of the mounds, it may be said that those\r\nof Ohio occur mostly within or near enclosures; sometimes in groups,\r\nbut oftener detached and isolated, and seldom with any degree of\r\nregularity in respect to each other. Such is believed to be the\r\ncase «generally» throughout the entire valley of the Mississippi. A\r\nsection of the Ohio valley, however, embraced between the mouths of\r\nthe Guyandotte and Scioto rivers, an extent of sixty miles, which\r\nwas [p141] examined with special reference to this point, exhibited\r\nno works of magnitude in the form of enclosures; yet there was an\r\nabundance of mounds, though chiefly of small dimensions. Occasional\r\ngroups of fifteen or twenty were noticed, sometimes occurring in\r\nlines, as if placed with design; a circumstance easily accounted for\r\nby the nature of the ground, which is here broken into long, low\r\nswells, or narrow ridges, with marshy intervals between them,—the\r\nmounds occupying the summits of the ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—HILL MOUNDS.]\r\n\r\nOn the tops of the hills, and on the jutting points of the table\r\nlands bordering the valleys in which the earthworks are found, mounds\r\noccur in considerable numbers. The most elevated and commanding\r\npositions are frequently crowned with them, suggesting at once the\r\npurposes to which some of the mounds or «cairns» of the ancient\r\nCelts were applied, that of signal or alarm posts. It is not unusual\r\nto find detached mounds among the hills back from the valleys and\r\nin secluded places, with no other monuments near. The hunter often\r\nencounters them in the depths of the forests, when least expected;\r\nperhaps overlooking some waterfall, or placed in some narrow valley\r\nwhere the foot of man seldom enters.\r\n\r\nThus much respecting the mounds could not escape observation, and has\r\nlong been known; but beyond this our information has been extremely\r\nlimited. And though partial excavations have been made at various\r\ntimes by different individuals, still nothing like a systematic\r\nexploration, sufficiently thorough and extensive to warrant any\r\nconclusion respecting them, has hitherto been attempted. The few\r\ndetached observations which have met the light have been too vague,\r\nand in many cases too poorly authenticated, to enable the inquirer to\r\nmake any satisfactory deductions from them.\r\n\r\nThe popular opinion, however, based in a great degree upon the well\r\nascertained purposes of the barrows and tumuli occurring in certain\r\nparts of Europe and Asia, is that they are simple monuments, marking\r\nthe last resting-place of some great [p142] chief or distinguished\r\nindividual, among the tribes of the builders. Some have supposed them\r\nto be the cemeteries, in which were deposited the dead of a tribe\r\nor a village for a certain period, and that the size of the mound\r\nis an indication of the number inhumed; others, that they mark the\r\nsites of great battles, and contain the bones of the slain. On all\r\nhands the opinion has been entertained, that they were devoted to\r\nsepulture alone. This received opinion is not, however, sustained\r\nby the investigations here recorded. The conclusion to which these\r\nresearches have led, is, that the mounds were constructed for several\r\ngrand and dissimilar purposes; or rather, that they are of different\r\nclasses. The conditions upon which the classification is founded are\r\nfour in number,—namely: position, form, structure, and contents. In\r\nthis classification, we distinguish—\r\n\r\n1st. ALTAR MOUNDS, which occur either within, or in the immediate\r\nvicinity of enclosures; which are stratified, and contain altars of\r\nburned clay or stone; and which were places of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n2d. MOUNDS OF SEPULTURE, which stand isolated or in groups more or\r\nless remote from the enclosures; which are not stratified; which\r\ncontain human remains; and which were the burial places and monuments\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\n3d. TEMPLE MOUNDS, which occur most usually within, but sometimes\r\nwithout the walls of enclosures; which possess great regularity of\r\nform; which contain neither altars nor human remains; and which\r\nwere “High Places” for the performance of religious rites and\r\nceremonies, the sites of structures, or in some way connected with\r\nthe superstitions of the builders.\r\n\r\n4th. ANOMALOUS MOUNDS, including mounds of observation and such as\r\nwere applied to a double purpose, or of which the design and objects\r\nare not apparent. This division includes all which do not clearly\r\nfall within the preceding three classes.\r\n\r\nThese classes are broadly marked in the aggregate, though in some\r\ninstances it is difficult to determine the character of the mounds\r\nwhich fall under notice. Of one hundred mounds examined, sixty were\r\naltar or temple mounds; twenty sepulchral; and twenty either places\r\nof observation or anomalous in their character. Such, however, is\r\nnot the proportion in which they occur. From the fact that the altar\r\nor sacrificial mounds are most interesting and productive in relics,\r\nthe largest number excavated was of that class. Excluding the temple\r\nmounds, which are not numerous, the remaining mounds of the Scioto\r\nvalley are distributed between the three other varieties in very\r\nnearly equal proportions.\r\n\r\nThese general observations will serve to introduce plans and sections\r\nwith accompanying descriptions of each of the above classes of\r\nmounds. The sections, for obvious reasons, are not drawn upon a\r\nuniform scale, nor are the relative proportions of the mounds always\r\npreserved; this however will result in no misunderstanding in any\r\nessential particulars. [p143]\r\n\r\n\r\n ALTAR OR SACRIFICIAL MOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of this class of mounds are:\r\n\r\n1st. That they occur only within, or in the immediate vicinity of\r\nenclosures or sacred places.[99] Of the whole number of mounds of\r\nthis class which were examined, «four» only were found to be exterior\r\nto the walls of enclosures, and these were but a few rods distant\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n2d. That they are stratified.\r\n\r\n3d. That they contain symmetrical altars of burned clay or stone; on\r\nwhich are deposited various remains, which in all cases have been\r\nmore or less subjected to the action of fire.\r\n\r\nThe fact of stratification, in these mounds, is one of great interest\r\nand importance. This feature has heretofore been remarked, but\r\nnot described with proper accuracy; and has consequently proved\r\nan impediment to the recognition of the artificial origin of the\r\nmounds, by those who have never seen them. The stratification, so far\r\nas observed, is not horizontal, but always conforms to the convex\r\noutline of the mound.[100] Nor does it resemble the stratification\r\nproduced by the action of water, where the layers run into each\r\nother, but is defined with the utmost distinctness, and always\r\nterminates upon reaching the level of the surrounding earth. That\r\nit is artificial will, however, be sufficiently apparent after an\r\nexamination of one of the mounds in which the feature occurs; for\r\nit would be difficult to explain, by what singular combination of\r\n“igneous and aqueous” action, stratified mounds were always raised\r\nover symmetrical monuments of burned clay or of stone.\r\n\r\nThe altars, or basins, found in these mounds, are almost invariably\r\nof burned clay, though a few of stone have been discovered. They\r\nare symmetrical, but not of uniform size and shape. Some are round,\r\nothers elliptical, and others square, or parallelograms. Some are\r\nsmall, measuring barely two feet across, while others are fifty\r\nfeet long by twelve or fifteen feet wide. The usual dimensions are\r\nfrom five to eight feet. All appear to have been modelled of fine\r\nclay brought to the spot from a distance, and they rest upon the\r\noriginal surface of the [p144] earth. In a few instances, a layer\r\nor small elevation of sand had been laid down, upon which the altar\r\nwas formed. The height of the altars, nevertheless, seldom exceeds\r\na foot or twenty inches above the adjacent level. The clay of which\r\nthey are composed is usually burned hard, sometimes to the depth of\r\nten, fifteen, and even twenty inches. This is hardly to be explained\r\nby any degree or continuance of heat, though it is manifest that in\r\nsome cases the heat was intense. On the other hand, a number of these\r\naltars have been noticed, which are very slightly burned; and such,\r\nit is a remarkable fact, are destitute of remains.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this class of mounds will be best explained,\r\nby reference to the accompanying illustrations. It should be\r\nremarked, however, that no two are precisely alike in all their\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe mound, a section of which is here given, occurs in “Mound City,”\r\na name given to a group of twenty-six mounds, embraced in one\r\nenclosure, on the banks of the Scioto river, three miles above the\r\ntown of Chillicothe. (See Plate XIX, mound No. 1.) It is seven feet\r\nhigh by fifty-five feet base. A shaft, five feet square, was sunk\r\nfrom its apex, with the following results:\r\n\r\n1st. Occurred a layer of coarse gravel and pebbles, which appeared to\r\nhave been taken from deep pits surrounding the enclosure, or from the\r\nbank of the river. This layer was one foot in thickness.\r\n\r\n2d. Beneath this layer of gravel and pebbles, to the depth of two\r\nfeet, the earth was homogeneous, though slightly mottled, as if\r\ntaken up and deposited in small loads, from different localities. In\r\none place appeared a deposit of dark-colored surface loam, and by\r\nits side, or covering it, there was a mass of the clayey soil from\r\na greater depth. The outlines of these various deposits could be\r\ndistinctly traced, as shown in Fig. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n3d. Below this deposit of earth, occurred a thin and even layer of\r\nfine sand, a little over an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\n4th. A deposit of earth, as above, eighteen inches in depth.\r\n\r\n5th. Another stratum of sand, somewhat thinner than the one above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n6th. Another deposit of earth, one foot thick; then—\r\n\r\n7th. A third stratum of sand; below which was—\r\n\r\n8th. Still another layer of earth, a few inches in thickness; which\r\nrested on—\r\n\r\n9th. An altar, or basin, of burned clay. [p145]\r\n\r\nThis altar was perfectly round. Its form and dimensions are best\r\nshown by the supplementary plan and section A. The altar, measured\r\nfrom «c» to «d», is nine feet in diameter; from «a» to «e», five\r\nfeet; height from «b» to «e», twenty inches; dip of curve «a r e»,\r\nnine inches. The sides «c a», «e d», slope regularly at a given\r\nangle. The body of the altar is burned throughout, though in a\r\ngreater degree within the basin, where it is so hard as to resist the\r\nblows of a heavy hatchet,—the instrument rebounding as if struck upon\r\na rock. The basin, or hollow of the altar, was filled up evenly with\r\nfine dry ashes, intermixed with which were some fragments of pottery,\r\nof an excellent finish, and ornamented with tasteful carvings on the\r\nexterior. One of the vases, of elegant model, taken in fragments\r\nfrom this mound, has been very nearly restored, and will be further\r\nnoticed in the chapter on the Pottery of the Mounds. A few convex\r\ncopper discs, much resembling the bosses used upon harnesses, were\r\nalso found.\r\n\r\nAbove the deposit of ashes, and covering the entire basin, was\r\na layer of silvery or opaque mica, in sheets, overlapping each\r\nother; upon which, immediately over the centre of the basin, was\r\nheaped a quantity of burned human bones, probably the amount of a\r\nsingle skeleton, in fragments. The position of these is indicated\r\nin the section. The layers of mica and calcined bones, it should\r\nbe remarked, to prevent misapprehension, were peculiar to this\r\nindividual mound, and were not found in any other of the class.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, by the section, that at a point about two feet\r\nbelow the surface of the mound, a human skeleton was found. It was\r\nplaced a little to the left of the centre, with the head to the\r\neast, and was so much decayed as to render it impossible to extract\r\na single bone entire. Above the skeleton, as shown in the section,\r\nthe layer of earth and the outer stratum of gravel and pebbles were\r\nbroken up and intermixed. Thus, while on one side of the shaft the\r\nstrata were clearly marked, on the other they were confused. And, as\r\nthis was the first mound of the class excavated, it was supposed,\r\nfrom this circumstance, that it had previously been opened by some\r\nexplorer; and it had been decided to abandon it, when the skeleton\r\nwas discovered. Afterwards the matter came to be fully understood. No\r\nrelics were found with this skeleton.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known, that the existing tribes of Indians, though\r\npossessing no knowledge of the origin or objects of the mounds,\r\nwere accustomed to regard them with some degree of veneration. It\r\nis also known, that they sometimes buried their dead in them, in\r\naccordance with their almost invariable custom of selecting elevated\r\npoints and the brows of hills as their cemeteries. That their\r\nremains should be found in the mounds, is therefore a matter of no\r\nsurprise. They are never discovered at any great depth, not often\r\nmore than eighteen inches or three feet below the surface. Their\r\nposition varies in almost every case: most of them are extended at\r\nlength, others have a sitting posture, while others again seem to\r\nhave been rudely thrust into their shallow graves without care or\r\narrangement. Rude implements of bone and stone, and coarse vessels\r\nof pottery, such as are known to have been in use among the Indians\r\nat the period of the earliest European intercourse, occur with some\r\nof them, particularly with those of a more ancient date; while\r\nmodern implements and ornaments, in some cases of [p146] European\r\norigin, are found with the recent burials. The necessity, therefore,\r\nof a careful and rigid discrimination, between these deposits and\r\nthose of the mound-builders, will be apparent. From the lack of such\r\ndiscrimination, much misapprehension and confusion have resulted.\r\nSilver crosses, gun-barrels, and French dial-plates, have been found\r\nwith skeletons in the mounds; yet it is not to be concluded that\r\nthe mound-builders were Catholics, or used fire-arms, or understood\r\nFrench. Such a conclusion would, nevertheless, be quite as well\r\nwarranted, as some which have been deduced from the absolute identity\r\nof certain relics taken from the mounds, with articles known to be\r\ncommon among the existing tribes of Indians. The fact of remains\r\noccurring in the mounds, is in itself hardly presumptive evidence\r\nthat they pertained to the builders. The conditions attending them\r\ncan alone determine their true character. As a general rule, to which\r\nthere are few exceptions, the only authentic and undoubted remains of\r\nthe mound-builders are found directly beneath the apex of the mound,\r\non a level with the original surface of the earth; and it may be\r\nsafely assumed, that whatever deposits occur near the surface of the\r\nmounds, are of a date subsequent to their erection.\r\n\r\nThe French maintained an intercourse, from a very early period,\r\nwith the Indian tribes of the West. In the way of barter or as\r\npresents they distributed amongst them vast quantities of ornaments\r\nand implements of various kinds; which, in accordance with the\r\nIndian custom, were buried with the possessor at his death. Nothing\r\nis therefore more common, in invading the humble sepulchre of\r\nthe Indian, than to find by the side of his skeleton the copper\r\nkettle, the gun, hatchet, and simple ornaments, so valued in his\r\nlife-time. The latter consist chiefly of small silver crosses and\r\nbrooches; several of which are sometimes found accompanying a single\r\nskeleton.[101]\r\n\r\nIn the class of mounds now under consideration we have data that will\r\nadmit of no doubt, whereby to judge of the origin, as well as of\r\nthe relative periods, of the various deposits found in them. If the\r\nstratification already mentioned as characterizing them is unbroken\r\nand undisturbed, if the strata are regular and entire, it [p147] is\r\ncertain that whatever occurs beneath them was placed there at the\r\nperiod of the construction of the mound. But if, on the other hand,\r\nthese strata are broken up, it is equally certain that the mound has\r\nbeen disturbed, and new deposits made, subsequent to its erection.\r\nIt is in this view, that the fact of stratification is seen to be\r\nimportant, as well as interesting; for it will serve to fix, beyond\r\nall dispute, the origin of many singular relics, having a decisive\r\nbearing on some of the leading questions connected with American\r\narchæology. The thickness of the exterior layer of gravel, in mounds\r\nof this class, varies with the dimensions of the mound, from eight\r\nto twenty inches. In a very few instances, the layer, which may have\r\nbeen designed to protect the form of the mound, and which purpose it\r\nadmirably subserves, is entirely wanting. The number and relative\r\nposition of the sand strata are variable; in some of the larger\r\nmounds, there are as many as six of them, in no case less than one,\r\nmost usually two or three.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nFig. 31 exhibits a section of mound No. 2 in the plan of “Mound\r\nCity.” This mound is ninety feet in diameter at the base by seven and\r\na half feet high, being remarkably broad and flat. A shaft six feet\r\nsquare was sunk from the apex with the following results:\r\n\r\n1st. Occurred the usual layer of gravel and pebbles, one foot thick.\r\n\r\n2d. A layer of earth, three feet thick.\r\n\r\n3d. A thin stratum of sand.\r\n\r\n4th. Another layer of earth two feet thick.\r\n\r\n5th. Another stratum of sand, beneath which, and separated by a few\r\ninches of earth, was—\r\n\r\n6th. The altar, Fig. 32.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nThis altar was a parallelogram of the utmost regularity, as shown in\r\nthe plan and section. At its base, it measures ten feet in length by\r\neight in width; at the top, six feet by four. Its height was eighteen\r\ninches, and the dip of the basin nine inches. Within the basin was\r\na deposit of fine ashes, unmixed with charcoal, three inches thick,\r\nmuch compacted by the weight of the superincumbent earth. Amongst\r\nthe ashes were some fragments of pottery, also a few shell and pearl\r\nbeads. Enough of the pottery was recovered to restore a beautiful\r\nvase, for a drawing and description of which the reader is referred\r\nto the paragraphs on «Pottery». The second or [p148] lower sand\r\nstratum in this, as in several other instances, rested directly upon\r\nthe outer sides of the altar.\r\n\r\nIn this mound, three feet below the surface, were found two very well\r\npreserved skeletons, the presence of which was indicated, at the\r\ncommencement of the excavation, by the interruption of the layers,\r\nas above described. They were placed side by side, the head of one\r\nresting at the elbow of the other. Under and about the heads of both\r\nwere deposited some large rough fragments of greenstone, identical\r\nwith that of which most of the stone implements of the former Indian\r\ntribes of the valley were made. There were also deposited with the\r\nskeletons many implements of stone, horn, and bone; among which was\r\na beautiful chip of hornstone, about the size of the palm of one’s\r\nhand, which had manifestly been used for cutting purposes. There were\r\nseveral hand-axes and gouges of stone, and some articles made from\r\nthe horns of the deer or elk, which resemble the handles of large\r\nknives; but no traces of iron or other metals were discoverable.\r\nAmong the implements of bone was one formed from the shoulder-blade\r\nof the buffalo, in shape resembling a Turkish scimetar; also a\r\nsingular notched instrument of bone, evidently intended for insertion\r\nin a handle, and designed, in common with similar articles in use by\r\nthe Indians of the present day, for distributing the paint in lines\r\nand other ornamental figures on the faces of the warriors. Another\r\ninstrument was also found, made by cutting off a section of the main\r\nstem of an elk’s horn, leaving one of the principal prongs attached;\r\nused perhaps as a hammer or war-club. Besides these there were some\r\ngouges made of elk’s horns, and a variety of similar relics; all of\r\nexceeding rudeness, and of no great antiquity. The skulls found in\r\nthis mound possessed no marked features to distinguish them from the\r\ncrania found in the known burial-places of the Shawanoes and other\r\nlate Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nThis mound, Fig. 33, is numbered 4 in the plan of “Mound City.” It is\r\noblong in shape, measuring ninety by sixty feet base, and six feet in\r\nheight. It has two sand strata, as shown in the section. The altar in\r\nthis mound is remarkable from its depth, which is twenty-two inches,\r\nthe hollow of the basin sinking a foot or more below the original\r\nsurface of the soil. Its form and dimensions are best explained by\r\nthe plan and section. Nothing was contained in the basin, except\r\na white mass or layer five inches thick, «a», presenting all the\r\nappearances of sharp [p149] lime mortar. Mingled with this mass,\r\nwhich was hard and compact, were a few fragments of calcined shells;\r\nleading to the inference, that it was formed from the burning of\r\nshells. It was afterwards found upon analysis, that the mass was\r\nprincipally carbonate of lime, with a considerable portion of earthy\r\nparticles, thus sustaining the inference already made. No fragments\r\nof bones, however small, were discoverable.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the mound just mentioned, the bases of the two running\r\ninto each other, is another mound, No. 5 in the plan of “Mound City.”\r\nIt is of the same form and dimensions with the one just described,\r\nand like that has two sand strata. The altar however more resembles\r\nthat of Fig. 31, though somewhat smaller in size. It contained a\r\nquantity, perhaps thirty pounds in all, of galena in pieces weighing\r\nfrom two ounces to three pounds; also several lumps of fine clay,\r\npossessing an unctuous feel. The latter appeared to have originally\r\nformed a model over which a vessel of some sort had been fashioned.\r\nAround this deposit there was considerable charcoal, apparently of a\r\nlight wood, but very little ashes. The altar, although the galena was\r\nbut slightly burned, bore marks of intense heat,—thus evincing that\r\nit had been previously subjected for a considerable period, or at\r\nfrequent intervals, to the action of fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nFig. 34 is a section of the long mound, No. 3, in the plan of “Mound\r\nCity.” For several reasons,—its shape, the great dimensions of its\r\nenclosed altar, and the number and variety of its relics,—this mound\r\nwas minutely investigated, and is worthy of a detailed description.\r\nIt is egg-shaped in form, and measures one hundred and forty feet in\r\nlength, by fifty and sixty respectively at its greater and smaller\r\nends, and is eleven feet high.\r\n\r\nIts longitudinal bearing is N. 20° W. Four shafts were sunk at as\r\nmany different points; between three of which, for a distance of over\r\nforty feet, connecting drifts were carried, as indicated in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe shaft «a» was first sunk. At the commencement of the excavation\r\nthe feature already mentioned, viz. the confusion of the layers, was\r\nremarked, and care was accordingly taken to uncover carefully the\r\nexpected recent deposit. This proved to be a single human skeleton,\r\nplaced in a sitting posture, the head resting on the knees. The top\r\nof the skull was eighteen inches below the surface. The skeleton was\r\nwell preserved, still retaining a large portion of its animal matter.\r\nThe lower jaw was broken, a circumstance observed in most of the\r\nskeletons thus found. No relics were deposited with this skeleton.\r\nThe sand strata occurred low down, following the curvature of the\r\nmound, as represented in the section.\r\n\r\nShaft «c» was next sunk. On the left side of the excavation a\r\ndisturbance was [p150] remarked; and at about two feet below the\r\nsurface, a rude earthern vessel holding something over one quart, and\r\nthe lower jaw of a human skeleton, were discovered. They were side by\r\nside, and seemed to have constituted the entire deposit.\r\n\r\nTwo sand strata occur in this mound, the first five feet below the\r\nsurface, the second one foot deeper. The intermediate layers of earth\r\npresented the mottled appearance already explained, and were much\r\ncompacted, rendering excavation exceedingly slow and laborious. The\r\nremaining shafts were afterwards sunk for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nthe size and form of the altar, but disclosed nothing of importance\r\nin their course.\r\n\r\nAlthough the altar in this mound was not fully exposed, yet enough\r\nwas uncovered to ascertain very nearly its character and extent.\r\nForty-five feet of its length was exposed, and in one place its\r\nentire width, which was eight feet across the top, by fifteen at the\r\nbase. The portions in the section, extending beyond the line of the\r\nexcavation, are supplied, giving an entire length to the altar of not\r\nfar from sixty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.—LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF ALTAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.—CROSS SECTION OF ALTAR.]\r\n\r\nBy attention to the longitudinal section of the altar B C B, it\r\nwill be seen that it shelves gradually from the ends, forming a\r\nbasin of not far from eighteen inches in depth. The outer slope is\r\nmore gradual than the inner one. Near the centre of the altar, two\r\npartitions, A A, are carried across it transversely, forming a minor\r\nbasin or compartment, C, eight feet square. Within this basin the\r\nrelics deposited in the mound were placed. The outer compartments\r\nseemed to have been filled with earth, previous to the final heaping\r\nover, so as to present a perfectly level surface, which had been\r\nslightly burned. This feature is indicated in the section, which\r\nalso illustrates another interesting and important peculiarity. Upon\r\npenetrating the altar (a task of no little difficulty in consequence\r\nof its extreme hardness) to ascertain its thickness, it was found\r\nto be burned to the depth of «twenty-two» inches. This could hardly\r\nbe accounted for by the application or continuance of any degree of\r\nheat from above, and was therefore the occasion of some surprise. A\r\nmore minute examination furnished the explanation. It was found that\r\none altar had been built upon another; as if one had been used for\r\na time, until, from defect or other causes, it was abandoned, when\r\nanother was «recast» upon it. This process, as shown in the section\r\nF E, had been repeated three times, the outline of each successive\r\nlayer being so distinct as to admit of no doubt as to its cause.\r\nThe partitions A A were constructed subsequently to the erection of\r\nthe altar, as is evidenced from the fact that they were scarcely\r\nburned through, while the altar immediately beneath them was burned\r\nto great hardness. Scattered upon the deposit of earth filling the\r\ncompartments D D, and resting upon [p151] the slopes of the altar,\r\nwere found the traces of a number of pieces of timber, four or five\r\nfeet long, and six or eight inches thick. They had been somewhat\r\nburned, and the carbonized surface had preserved their casts in the\r\nhard earth, although the wood had entirely decayed. They had been\r\nheaped over while glowing, for the earth around them was slightly\r\nbaked. In fact the entire hollow of the altar was covered with a\r\nthin layer of fine carbonaceous matter, much like that formed by\r\nthe burning of leaves or straw. These pieces had been of nearly\r\nuniform length; and this circumstance, joined to the position in\r\nwhich they occurred in respect to each other and to the altar, would\r\nalmost justify the inference that they had supported some funeral or\r\nsacrificial pile.\r\n\r\nThe remains found in this mound were, in their number and variety,\r\ncommensurate with the labor and care bestowed on its construction.\r\nA quantity of pottery and many implements of copper and stone were\r\ndeposited on the altar, intermixed with much coal and ashes. They\r\nhad all been subjected to a strong heat, which had broken up most\r\nof those which could be thus affected by its action. A large number\r\nof spear-heads, as they have been termed, beautifully chipped out\r\nof quartz and manganese garnet, had been placed here; but, out of\r\na bushel or two of fragments, four specimens only were recovered\r\nentire. One of them is faithfully figured under the head of\r\n“Implements.” A quantity of the raw material, from which they were\r\nmanufactured, was also found, consisting of large fragments of quartz\r\nand of crystals of garnet. Some of these crystals had been of large\r\nsize, certainly not less than three or four inches in diameter. A\r\nsingle arrow-point of «obsidian» was found; also a number of fine\r\narrow-heads of limpid quartz. One of these was four inches in length,\r\nand all were finely wrought. Judging from the quantity of fragments,\r\nsome fifty or a hundred of these were originally deposited on the\r\naltar. Among the fragments were some large thin pieces of the same\r\nmaterial, shaped like the blade of a knife. Two copper gravers or\r\nchisels, one measuring six, the other eight inches in length, (see\r\n“«Implements»,”) also twenty or more tubes formed of thin strips\r\nof copper, an inch and a quarter long by three eighths of an inch\r\ndiameter, (see “«Ornaments»,”) were found among the remains. A large\r\nquantity of pottery, much broken up, enough perhaps to have formed\r\noriginally a dozen vessels of moderate size, was also discovered. Two\r\nvases have been very nearly restored. They resemble, in material and\r\nform, those already mentioned, and have similar markings on their\r\nexterior. (See “«Pottery».”) Also a couple of carved pipes; one of\r\nwhich, of beautiful model and fine finish, is cut out of a stone\r\nclosely resembling, if indeed not identical with, the Potomac marble,\r\nof which the columns of the hall of the House of Representatives at\r\nWashington are made. The other is a bold figure of a bird, resembling\r\nthe toucan, cut in white limestone.\r\n\r\nA portion of the contents of this mound were cemented together by\r\na tufa-like substance of a gray color, resembling the scoriæ of\r\na furnace, and of great hardness. It was at first supposed to be\r\ncarbonate of lime gradually deposited, in the lapse of time, from the\r\nwater percolating through the outer stratum of limestone gravel and\r\npebbles. The quantity however, covering as it did a large part of the\r\nbasin to the depth of an inch or two, weighed strongly against such a\r\nconclusion; and a subsequent analysis demonstrated that it was made\r\nup in part of «phosphates». A [p152] single fragment of partially\r\ncalcined bone was found on the altar. It was the «patella» of the\r\nhuman skeleton.\r\n\r\nSuch were the more important features of this interesting mound. It\r\nis evident that the enclosed altar had been often used, and several\r\ntimes remodelled, before it was finally heaped over. Why this was at\r\nlast done, upon what occasion, and with what strange ceremonies, are\r\nquestions which will probably forever remain unanswered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\nFig. 37 is a section of mound No. 8 in “Mound City.” In the number\r\nand value of its relics, this mound far exceeds any hitherto\r\nexplored. It is small in size, and in its structure exhibits nothing\r\nremarkable. It had but one sand stratum, the edges of which rested\r\non the outer slopes of the altar, as shown in the section. Between\r\nthis stratum and the deposit in the basin occurred a layer, a few\r\ninches thick, of burned loam. The altar itself (Fig. 38) was somewhat\r\nsingular, though quite regular in shape. In length it was six feet\r\ntwo inches, in width four feet. At the point indicated in the section\r\nwas a depression of perhaps six inches below the general level of the\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.—PLAN OF ALTAR.]\r\n\r\nThe deposit («a») in this altar was large. Intermixed with much\r\nashes, were found not far from «two hundred» pipes, carved in stone,\r\nmany pearl and shell beads, numerous discs, tubes, etc., of copper,\r\nand a number of other ornaments of copper, covered with silver,\r\netc. etc. The pipes were much broken up,—some of them calcined by\r\nthe heat, which had been sufficiently strong to melt copper, masses\r\nof which were found fused together in the centre of the basin. A\r\nlarge number have nevertheless been restored, at the expense of much\r\nlabor and no small amount of patience. They are mostly composed of\r\na red porphyritic stone, somewhat resembling the pipe stone of the\r\n«Coteau des Prairies», excepting that it is of great hardness and\r\ninterspersed with small variously colored granules. The fragments of\r\nthis material which had been most exposed to the heat were changed to\r\na brilliant black color, resembling Egyptian marble. Nearly all the\r\narticles carved in limestone, of which there had been a number, were\r\ncalcined.\r\n\r\nThe bowls of most of the pipes are carved in miniature figures of\r\nanimals, birds, reptiles, etc. All of them are executed with strict\r\nfidelity to nature, and with exquisite skill. Not only are the\r\nfeatures of the various objects represented faithfully, but their\r\npeculiarities and habits are in some degree exhibited. The otter is\r\nshown in a characteristic attitude, holding a fish in his mouth;\r\nthe heron also holds [p153] a fish; and the hawk grasps a small\r\nbird in its talons, which it tears with its beak. The panther, the\r\nbear, the wolf, the beaver, the otter, the squirrel, the raccoon,\r\nthe hawk, the heron, crow, swallow, buzzard, «paroquet», «toucan»,\r\nand other indigenous and southern birds,—the turtle, the frog, toad,\r\nrattlesnake, etc., are recognized at first glance. But the most\r\ninteresting and valuable in the list, are a number of sculptured\r\nhuman heads, no doubt faithfully representing the predominant\r\nphysical features of the ancient people by whom they were made. We\r\nhave this assurance in the minute accuracy of the other sculptures of\r\nthe same date. For engravings of these as well as of a large series\r\nof the other relics here mentioned, the reader is referred to the\r\npassages on “«Sculptures».” Appropriate notices of the remaining\r\narticles discovered in this mound,—the copper discs and tubes, pearl,\r\nshell, and silver beads, etc.,—will be found under the head of\r\n“«Ornaments».”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nFig. 39 is a section of mound No. 18 in “Mound City.” It has three\r\nsand strata, and an altar of the usual form and dimensions. This\r\naltar contained no relics, but was thinly covered with a carbonaceous\r\ndeposit, resembling burned leaves. The feature of this mound most\r\nworthy of remark was a singular burial by «incremation», which had\r\nbeen made in it at some period subsequent to its erection. The\r\nindications (so often remarked as to need no further specification\r\nhere) that the mound had been disturbed were observed at the\r\ncommencement of the excavation. At the depth of four and a half feet,\r\nthe deposit was reached (Fig. 41). A quantity of water-worn stones,\r\nabout the size of common paving stones, and evidently taken from the\r\nriver close by, had been laid down, forming a rude pavement six feet\r\nlong by four broad. Lying diagonally upon this pavement, as shown\r\nin Fig. 40, with its head to the north-west, was a skeleton. It was\r\nremarkably well preserved, and retained much of its animal matter,—a\r\nfact attributable in some degree to the antiseptic qualities of the\r\ncarbonaceous material surrounding it.[102] A fire had been built over\r\nthe body after it was deposited, its traces being plainly visible\r\non the stones, all of which were slightly burned. A quantity of\r\ncarbonaceous matter, resembling [p154] that formed by the sudden\r\ncovering up of burning twigs or other light materials, covered the\r\npavement and the skeleton. There were no relics with the skeleton;\r\nalthough around its head were disposed a number of large fragments\r\nof sienite, identical with that of which many of the instruments of\r\nthe modern Indians are known to have been made, previous and for some\r\ntime subsequent to the introduction of iron amongst them. After the\r\nburial had been performed, and the hole partly filled, another fire\r\nhad been kindled, burning the earth of a reddish color, and leaving\r\na distinctly marked line, as indicated in the section. The hole had\r\nthen been completely filled up, so as to leave a scarcely perceptible\r\ndepression in the mound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nFig. 41 is a section of mound No. 7 in “Mound City.” This mound is\r\nmuch the largest within the enclosure, measuring seventeen and a half\r\nfeet in height by ninety feet base. From its top a full view of the\r\nentire group is commanded. A shaft nine feet square was sunk from the\r\napex. The outer layer of gravel, which in this case was twenty inches\r\nthick, was found to be broken up, and at the depth of three feet (at\r\na point indicated by «a» in the section) were found two copper axes,\r\nweighing respectively two, and two and one fourth pounds. At the\r\ndepth of seven feet occurred the first sand stratum, below which,\r\nat intervals of little more than a foot, were three more,—«four» in\r\nall. At the depth of nineteen feet was found a smooth level floor of\r\nclay, slightly burned, which was covered with a thin layer of sand\r\nan inch in thickness. This sand had a marked ferruginous appearance,\r\nand seemed to be cemented together, breaking up into large fragments\r\na foot or two square. At one side of the shaft, and resting on the\r\nsand, was noticed a layer of silvery mica, as shown in the plan of\r\nthe excavation, Fig. 42. It was formed of round sheets, ten inches\r\nor a foot in diameter, overlapping each other like the scales of a\r\nfish. Lateral excavations were made to determine its extent, with\r\nthe result indicated in the plan. The portion uncovered exhibited\r\nsomething over one half of a large and regular crescent, the outer\r\nedge of which rested on an elevation or ridge of sand six inches\r\nin height, as shown in the supplementary section «o». The entire\r\nlength of [155] the crescent from horn to horn could not have been\r\nless than twenty feet, and its greatest width five. The clay floor\r\nof this mound was but a few inches in thickness; a small shaft,\r\n«c», was sunk three feet below it, but it disclosed only a mass of\r\ncoarse ferruginous sand. The earth composing the mound was incredibly\r\ncompact, rendering excavation exceedingly slow and laborious. Two\r\nactive men were employed more than a week in making the excavation\r\nhere indicated. It is not absolutely certain that the mound was\r\nraised over the simple deposit above mentioned, and it may yet be\r\nsubjected to a more rigid investigation.\r\n\r\nAlthough this mound is classed as a mound of sacrifice, it presents\r\nsome features peculiar to itself. Were we to yield to the temptation\r\nto speculation which the presence of the mica crescent holds out, we\r\nmight conclude that the mound-builders worshipped the moon, and that\r\nthis mound was dedicated, with unknown rites and ceremonies, to that\r\nluminary. It may be remarked that some of the mica sheets were of\r\nthat peculiar variety known as “hieroglyphic” or “graphic mica.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nFig. 43 is a section of mound No. 9, in the plan of the great work\r\non the North fork of Paint creek (Plate X). It will be seen that\r\nthis mound has several peculiar features. The altar, «a», instead of\r\noccupying the centre, is placed considerably towards one side, and a\r\nlayer of charcoal, «c», fills the corresponding opposite side. Over\r\nthe altar curves a stratum of sand, and over the layer of charcoal\r\nstill another, as exhibited in the section. This altar was the\r\nsmallest met with. It was round, not measuring more than two feet\r\nacross the top. It was nevertheless rich in remains. Within it were\r\nfound—\r\n\r\n1st. Several instruments of «obsidian». They were considerably broken\r\nup, but have been so much restored, as to exhibit pretty nearly their\r\noriginal form. Too large for arrow-heads, and too thin and slender\r\nfor points of spears, they seem to have been designed for cutting\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n2d. Several scrolls tastefully cut from thin sheets of mica. They\r\nare perforated with small holes, as if they had been attached as\r\nornaments to a robe of some description.\r\n\r\n3d. Traces of cloth; small portions of which, though completely\r\ncarbonized, were found, still retaining the structure of the thread.\r\nThis appeared to have been made of some fine vegetable fibre. It was\r\nwhat is technically termed “doubled and twisted,” and was about the\r\nsize of fine pack-thread.\r\n\r\n4th. A considerable number of ivory or bone needles, or\r\ngraving-tools, about one tenth of an inch thick. Their original\r\nlength is not known. Several fragments were found two and three\r\ninches long. Some have flat cutting points, the points of others were\r\nround and sharp; some were straight, others slightly bent. [p156]\r\n\r\n5th. A quantity of pearl beads; an article resembling the cover of a\r\nsmall vessel, carved from stone; also some fragments of copper, in\r\nthin narrow slips.\r\n\r\nThere were no relics of any kind found amongst the charcoal. The\r\nlayer of this material was not far from six feet square. It had been\r\nheaped over while burning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nFig. 44 is a section of a large mound, No. 5, in the same enclosure.\r\nIn this instance the altar was covered with stones; and instead of\r\nthe usual sand stratum, there was found a layer of large flat stones,\r\ncorresponding to it. The altar, A, was composed of earth elevated\r\ntwo and a half feet above the original level of the soil, and was\r\nfive feet long by three feet four inches broad, the sides sloping at\r\nan angle of nearly thirty degrees. It was faced on the top and on\r\nthe sides with slabs of stone, quite regular in form and thickness,\r\nand which, although not cut by any instrument, were closely fitted\r\ntogether, as shown in the supplementary section of the altar, A. The\r\nstone is the Waverley sandstone, underlying the coal series, thin\r\nstrata of which cap the hills bordering these valleys. The altar\r\nbore the marks of fire; and a few fragments of the mound-builders’\r\nornaments, a few pearl beads, etc., were found on and around it. The\r\noriginal deposit had probably been removed by the modern Indians, who\r\nhad opened the mound and buried one of their dead on the slope of\r\nthe altar. The stones composing the layer corresponding to the sand\r\nstratum were two or three deep, presenting the appearance of a wall\r\nwhich had fallen inwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the large enclosure, Plate XIX, is a solitary mound,\r\nof which a section is here presented, Fig. 45. It is now, after\r\nmany years of cultivation, about five feet high by forty feet base.\r\nLike that last described, it has some novel features, although its\r\npurposes can hardly admit of a doubt. It has the casing of pebbles\r\nand gravel which characterize the altar-mounds, but has no sand\r\nlayer, except a thin stratum resting immediately on the deposit\r\ncontained in the altar. This altar is entirely peculiar. It seems\r\nto have been formed, at different intervals of time, as follows:\r\nfirst, a circular space, thirteen feet in diameter and eight inches\r\nin depth, was excavated in the original level of the plain; this\r\nwas filled with fine sand, carefully levelled, and compacted to\r\nthe utmost degree. Upon the level thus formed, which was perfectly\r\nhorizontal, offerings by fire were made; at any rate a continuous\r\nheat was kept up, and fatty matter of some sort burned, for the sand\r\nto the depth of two inches is discolored, and to the depth of one\r\ninch is burned hard and black and cemented together. The ashes, etc.,\r\nresulting from [p157] this operation, were then removed, and another\r\ndeposit of sand, of equal thickness with the former, was placed above\r\nit, and in like manner much compacted. This was moulded into the form\r\nrepresented in the plan, which is identical with that of the circular\r\nclay altars already described; the basin, in this instance, measuring\r\nseven feet in diameter by eight inches in depth. This basin was then\r\ncarefully paved with small round stones, each a little larger than a\r\nhen’s egg, which were laid with the utmost precision, fully rivalling\r\nthe pavior’s finest work. They were firmly bedded in the sand beneath\r\nthem, so as to present a regular and uniform surface. Upon the altar\r\nthus constructed was found a burnt deposit, carefully covered with\r\na layer of sand, above which was heaped the superstructure of the\r\nmound. The deposit consisted of a thin layer of carbonaceous matter,\r\nintermingled with which were some burned human bones, but so much\r\ncalcined as to render recognition extremely difficult. Ten well\r\nwrought copper bracelets were also found, placed in two heaps, five\r\nin each, and encircling some calcined bones,—probably those of the\r\narms upon which they were originally worn. Besides these were found a\r\ncouple of thick plates of mica, placed upon the western slope of the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nAssuming, what must be very obvious from its form and other\r\ncircumstances, that this was an altar and not a tomb, we are almost\r\nirresistibly led to the conclusion, that human sacrifices were\r\npractised by the race of the mounds. This conclusion is sustained by\r\nother facts, which have already been presented, and which need not be\r\nrecapitulated here.\r\n\r\nThe two mounds last described are the only ones yet discovered\r\npossessing altars of stone; and, although it is likely there are\r\nothers of similar construction, their occurrence must be very rare.\r\n\r\nSuch are the prevailing characteristics of this class of mounds.\r\nIt will be remarked that while all have the same general features,\r\nno two are alike in their details. They differ in the number and\r\nrelative position of their sand strata, as well as in the size and\r\nshape of their altars and the character of the deposits made on them.\r\nOne mound covers a deposit made up almost entirely of pipes, another\r\na deposit of spear-heads, or of galena or calcined shells or bones.\r\nIn a few instances the symmetrical altar, of which so many examples\r\nhave been given, is wanting, and its place is supplied by a level\r\nfloor or platform of earth. Such was the case with mound No. 1, in\r\nthe plan of the great work on the North fork of Paint creek, already\r\nreferred to. This mound, although one of the richest in contents,\r\nwas one of the smallest met with, being not over three feet in\r\nheight. Its deposit was first disturbed by the plough, some years\r\nago, and numerous singular articles were then taken from it. Upon\r\ninvestigation, in place of the altar, a level area ten or fifteen\r\nfeet broad was found, much burned, on which the relics had been\r\nplaced. These had been covered over with earth to perhaps the depth\r\nof a foot, followed by a stratum of small stones, and an outer layer\r\nof earth two feet in thickness. Hundreds of relics, and many of the\r\nmost interesting and valuable hitherto found, were taken from this\r\nmound, among which may be mentioned several coiled serpents, carved\r\nin stone, and carefully enveloped in sheet mica and copper; [p158]\r\npottery; carved fragments of ivory; a large number of fossil teeth;\r\nnumerous fine sculptures in stone, etc. Notice will be taken of some\r\nof the most remarkable of these, under the appropriate heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nAnother singular mound of somewhat anomalous character, of which a\r\nsection is herewith given, (Fig. 46,) occurred in the same enclosure\r\nwith the above. It is numbered 2 in Plate X, and is remarkable as\r\nbeing very broad and flat, measuring at least eighty feet in diameter\r\nby but six or seven in height. It has two sand strata; but instead\r\nof an altar, there are two layers of discs chipped out of hornstone,\r\n(A A of the section,) some nearly round, others in the form of\r\nspear-heads. They are of various sizes, but are for the most part\r\nabout six inches long, by four wide, and three quarters of an inch\r\nor an inch in thickness. They were placed side by side, a little\r\ninclining, and one layer resting immediately on the other. Out of\r\nan excavation six feet long by four wide, not far from six hundred\r\nwere thrown. The deposit extends beyond the limits of the excavation\r\non every side. Supposing it to be twelve feet square, (and it may\r\nbe twenty or thirty,) we have not far from four thousand of these\r\ndiscs deposited here. If they were thus placed as an offering, we can\r\nform some estimate, in view of the facts that they must have been\r\nbrought from a great distance, and fashioned with great toil, of the\r\ndevotional fervor which induced the sacrifice, or the magnitude of\r\nthe calamity which that sacrifice was perhaps intended to avert. The\r\nfact, that this description of stone chips most easily when newly\r\nquarried, has induced the suggestion that the discs were deposited\r\nhere for the purpose of protecting them from the hardening influence\r\nof the atmosphere, and were intended to be withdrawn and manufactured\r\nas occasion warranted or necessity required. It is incredible,\r\nhowever, that so much care should be taken to fashion the mound\r\nand introduce the mysterious sand strata, if it was designed to be\r\ndisturbed at any subsequent period. There is little doubt that the\r\ndeposit was final, and was made in compliance with some religious\r\nrequirement. An excavation below these layers discovered traces of\r\nfire, but too slight to be worthy of more than a passing remark.\r\n\r\nA mound marked E in the plan of the great work, Plate XXI, No. 2, was\r\nfound to enclose an altar of small dimensions, which contained only a\r\nfew perforated wolf’s teeth and some fifteen or twenty bones of the\r\ndeer, all of them much burned. Six or eight inches above the deposit\r\nwas a stratum of large pebbles.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that some of the mounds of this class contain\r\naltars which have been but slightly burned, and that such are\r\ndestitute of remains. A few altars have been noticed, which have been\r\nmuch burned, but having no deposit upon them, except a thin layer of\r\nphosphate of lime, which seems to have incorporated itself with the\r\nclay of which they are composed, giving them the appearance of [p159]\r\nhaving been plastered with mortar. Nos. 6, 9, and 18, in “Mound\r\nCity,” are examples of this class. No coals or ashes were found on\r\nany of these; they appear to have been carefully cleaned out before\r\nbeing heaped over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nAn explanation of this circumstance may probably be found in the\r\ncharacter of a certain class of small mounds, occurring within\r\nenclosures and in connection with the altar mounds. In the plan of\r\n“Mound City” so often referred to are several of these, numbered 14,\r\n15, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 23, respectively. They are very small, the\r\nlargest not exceeding three feet in height, and are destitute of\r\naltars. In place thereof, on the original level of the earth, was\r\nfound a quantity, in no case exceeding the amount of one skeleton, of\r\nburned human bones, in small fragments. That they were not burned on\r\nthe spot is evident from the absence of all traces of fire, beyond\r\nthose furnished by the remains themselves. They appear to have been\r\ncollected from the pyre, wherever it was erected, and carefully\r\ndeposited in a small heap, and then covered over. In one instance\r\n(mound No. 19) a small hole had been dug, in which the remains were\r\nfound. A section of this mound is herewith given, Fig. 47. The\r\ndeposit is indicated by the letter «a». This feature is analogous\r\nto the «cists» of the British barrows. That the burning took place\r\non some of the altars above mentioned is not only indicated by the\r\npresence of the deposit of phosphate of lime upon them, but is\r\nabsolutely demonstrated by finding, intermixed with the calcined\r\nbones, «fragments of the altars themselves», as if portions had been\r\nscaled up by the instrument used in scraping together and removing\r\nthe burned remains.\r\n\r\nThe inference that human sacrifices were made here, and the remains\r\nafterwards thus collected and deposited, or that a system of burial\r\nof this extraordinary character was practised in certain cases,\r\nseems to follow legitimately from the facts and circumstances here\r\npresented.[103]\r\n\r\nThat the stratified mounds are not burial places seems sufficiently\r\nwell established by the fact that the greater number have no traces\r\nof human remains upon or around the altars. The suggestion that the\r\nvarious relics found upon these altars were the personal effects of\r\ndeceased chiefs or priests, thus deposited in accordance with the\r\npractice common amongst rude people, of consigning the property of\r\nthe dead to the tomb with them, is controverted by the fact that\r\n[p160] the deposits are generally homogeneous. That is to say,\r\ninstead of finding a large variety of relics, ornaments, weapons,\r\nand other articles, such as go to make up the possessions of a\r\nbarbarian dignitary, we find upon one altar «pipes» only, upon\r\nanother a simple mass of galena, while the next one has a quantity\r\nof pottery, or a collection of spear heads, or else is destitute of\r\nremains except perhaps a thin layer of carbonaceous material. Such\r\ncould not possibly be the case upon the above hypothesis, for the\r\nspear, the arrows, the pipe, and the other implements and personal\r\nornaments of the dead, would then be found in connection with each\r\nother. Besides the negative evidence here afforded in support of our\r\nclassification, it is sustained by the circumstance that these mounds\r\nare almost invariably found within enclosures, which, for a variety\r\nof concurring reasons, we are induced to believe were sacred in their\r\norigin, and devoted primarily, if not exclusively, to religious\r\npurposes. The circumstance of stratification, exhibiting as it does\r\nan extraordinary care and attention, can hardly be supposed to\r\nresult from any but superstitious notions. It certainly has no exact\r\nanalogy in any of the monuments of the globe, of which we possess\r\na knowledge, and its significance is beyond rational conjecture.\r\nWhy these altars, some of which, as we have already seen, had been\r\nused for considerable periods, were finally heaped over, is an\r\nembarrassing question, and one to which it is impossible to suggest\r\na satisfactory answer. That all were not covered by mounds is quite\r\ncertain. The “brick hearths,” of which mention has occasionally been\r\nmade by writers upon our antiquities, were doubtless none other than\r\nuncovered altars. Nothing is more likely than that, even though\r\ndesigned to be subsequently covered, some were left exposed by the\r\nbuilders, and afterwards hidden by natural accumulations, to be\r\nagain exposed by the invading plough or the recession of the banks\r\nof streams. The indentations occasioned by the growth of roots over\r\ntheir surfaces, or the cracks resulting from other causes, would\r\nnaturally suggest the notion of rude brick hearths. One of these\r\n“hearths” was discovered some years since near the town of Marietta\r\nin Ohio. It was surrounded by a low bank, of about one hundred feet\r\nin circumference, which seemed to have been the ground plan or\r\ncommencement of a mound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.—ELLIPTICAL MOUND]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99] It is not assumed to say that «all» the mounds occurring within\r\nenclosures are altar or sacrificial mounds. On the contrary, some are\r\nfound which, to say the least, are «anomalous»; while others were\r\nclearly the «sites of structures», or temple mounds.\r\n\r\n[100] Some of the mounds on the lower Mississippi, as we have already\r\nseen in the chapter on the aboriginal monuments of the Southern\r\nStates, are horizontally stratified, exhibiting numerous layers,\r\nfrom base to summit. These mounds differ in form from the conical\r\nstructures here referred to, and were perhaps constructed for a\r\ndifferent purpose. Some are represented as composed of layers of\r\nearth, two or three feet thick, each one of which is surmounted by a\r\nburned surface, which has been mistaken for a rude brick pavement.\r\nOthers are composed of alternate layers of earth and human remains.\r\nThe origin of the latter is doubtless to be found in the annual\r\nbone burials of the Cherokees and other southern Indians, of which\r\naccounts are given by Bartram and the early writers.\r\n\r\n[101] In the construction of the Ohio canal, a mound was partially\r\nexcavated, in which were found a dial-plate and other articles of\r\nEuropean origin. The circumstances are detailed in a private letter\r\nfrom WILLIAM H. PRICE, Esq., of Chillicothe, late member of the Board\r\nof Public Works of Ohio, under whose direction the mound was removed:\r\n\r\n“In the year 1827, during the excavation of a part of the Ohio canal\r\nin the township of Benton, Cuyahoga county, a short distance north\r\nof the mouth of Brandywine creek, it became necessary to remove part\r\nof a small mound, so situated in the valley of a small rivulet as,\r\nat first, to induce doubts as to its being artificial. However, in\r\nthe process of excavation, the remains of one or more human skeletons\r\nwere found, also a gun barrel, and perhaps some of the mountings of\r\nthe stock. In relation to the last I am not positive, but distinctly\r\nremember a circular brass plate or disc perhaps one sixteenth of an\r\ninch in thickness, with (I think) «raised» letters and figures on one\r\nside, which exhibited a French calendar, so arranged as to serve for\r\na century. I may mistake the duration for which it was intended, but\r\ngive the above as my decided impression. I do not recollect the date,\r\nbut think it was near the middle of the seventeenth century,—say 1640\r\nor thereabouts.”\r\n\r\nSeveral silver crosses, a number of small bags of vermilion, and\r\nother relics, were discovered not long since by Mr. C. A. VAUGHN,\r\nof Cincinnati, in some mounds excavated by that gentleman in the\r\nvicinity of Beardstown, Ill. They were found with skeletons, a few\r\nfeet below the surface.\r\n\r\n[102] The skull of this skeleton, which is singularly large and\r\nmassive, is now in the possession of Samuel G. Morton, M.D., of\r\nPhiladelphia. It is of the same conformation with those of the recent\r\nIndians which surround it in his extensive collection.\r\n\r\n[103] Amongst the Mexicans, burial by fire was generally practised.\r\nClavigero mentions a fact, in connection with their funeral rites,\r\nwhich may serve to elucidate the point here raised, viz that burial\r\n«in the vicinity of some altar or temple, or in the sacred places\r\nwhere sacrifices were made», was often sought by the Mexicans:\r\n\r\n“There was no fixed place for burials. Many ordered their ashes to\r\nbe buried near some temple or altar, some in the fields, and others\r\nin their sacred places in the mountains where sacrifices used to\r\nbe made. The ashes of the kings and lords were, for the most part,\r\ndeposited in the towers of the temples, especially those of the\r\ngreater temple.”—«Clavigero, American Edition», vol ii. p. 108;\r\n«Acosta in Purchas», vol. iii. p. 1029.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p161]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII.\r\n MOUNDS OF SEPULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.—GROUP OF SEPULCHRAL MOUNDS.]\r\n\r\nMounds of this class are very numerous. They are generally of\r\nconsiderable size, varying from six to eighty feet in height, but\r\nhaving an average altitude of from fifteen to twenty or twenty-five\r\nfeet. They stand without the walls of enclosures, at a distance more\r\nor less remote from them. Many are isolated, with no other monuments\r\nnear them; but they frequently occur in groups, sometimes in close\r\nconnection with each other, and exhibiting a dependence which was\r\nprobably not without its meaning. They are destitute of altars, nor\r\ndo they possess that regularity which characterizes the “temple\r\nmounds.” Their usual form is that of a simple cone; sometimes they\r\nare elliptical or pear-shaped.\r\n\r\nThese mounds invariably cover a skeleton, (in very rare instances\r\nmore than one, as in the case of the Grave creek mound,) which at\r\nthe time of its interment was enveloped in bark or coarse matting,\r\nor enclosed in a rude sarcophagus of timber,—the traces, in some\r\ninstances the very casts of which remain. Occasionally the chamber\r\nof the dead is built of stone, rudely laid up, without cement of\r\nany kind. Burial by fire seems to have been frequently practised by\r\nthe mound-builders. Urn burial also appears to have prevailed, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nWith the skeletons in these mounds are found various remains of art,\r\ncomprising [p162] ornaments, utensils, and weapons. The structure\r\nand contents of a few mounds of this class will sufficiently explain\r\ntheir general character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\nFig. 50 exhibits a section of a large sepulchral mound situated on\r\nthe third terrace, on the east bank of the Scioto river, about six\r\nmiles below the city of Chillicothe.[104] It is the largest of the\r\ngroup, represented in the cut (Fig. 49) at the head of this chapter.\r\nThere are no enclosures nearer than a mile; though there are three\r\nor four other mounds of smaller size, on the same terrace, within\r\na few hundred yards. The mound is twenty-two feet high by ninety\r\nfeet base. The principal excavation was made (as represented in the\r\nsection) from the west side, commencing at about one third of the\r\nheight of the mound from the top, and was carried in a slanting\r\ndirection towards the centre. The soil of the mound is a sandy loam,\r\nentirely homogeneous throughout, though much compacted and slightly\r\ndifferent in color towards the centre, where water cannot penetrate.\r\nAt ten feet below the surface occurred a layer of charcoal, «a», not\r\nfar from ten feet square, and from two to six inches in thickness,\r\nslightly inclined from the horizontal, and lying mostly to the left\r\nof the centre of the mound. The coal was coarse and clear, and seemed\r\nto have been formed by the sudden covering up of the wood while\r\nburning, inasmuch as the trunks and branches perfectly retained their\r\nform, though entirely carbonized, and the earth immediately above as\r\nwell as beneath was burned of a reddish color. Below this layer, the\r\nearth became much more compact and difficult of excavation. At the\r\ndepth of twenty-two feet, and on a level with the original surface,\r\nimmediately underneath the charcoal layer, and, like that, somewhat\r\nto one side of the centre of the mound, was a rude sarcophagus or\r\nframework of timber, Fig. 51, now reduced to an almost impalpable\r\npowder, but the «cast» of which was still retained in the hard\r\nearth. This enclosure of timber, measuring from outside to outside,\r\nwas nine feet long by seven wide, and twenty inches high. It had\r\nbeen constructed of unhewn logs laid one upon the other, and had\r\nevidently been covered with other timbers, which had sunk under the\r\nsuperincumbent earth, as they decayed. The bottom had also been\r\ncovered with bark, matting, or thin slabs of wood,—at any rate, a\r\nwhitish stratum of decomposed material remained, covering [p163]\r\nthe bottom of the parallelogram. Within this rude coffin, with its\r\nhead to the west, was found a human skeleton, or rather the remains\r\nof one; for scarcely a fragment as long as one’s finger could be\r\nrecovered. It was so much decayed that it crumbled to powder under\r\nthe lightest touch. Of course, no portion of the cranium, of the\r\nslightest value for purposes of comparison, was recovered.\r\n\r\nAround the neck of the skeleton, forming a triple row, and retaining\r\ntheir position as originally strung and deposited with the dead,\r\nwere several hundred beads, made of the compact portion of marine\r\nshells and of the tusks of some animal. Several of these still retain\r\ntheir polish, and bear marks which seem to indicate that they were\r\nturned in some machine, instead of being carved or rubbed into shape\r\nby hand. A few laminæ of mica were also discovered; which completed\r\nthe list of articles deposited with this skeleton, of which any\r\ntraces remained. The feet of the skeleton were about in the centre\r\nof the mound; a drift beyond it disclosed nothing new, nor was a\r\ncorresponding layer of charcoal found on the opposite side of the\r\nmound. It is clear, therefore, that the tumulus was raised over this\r\nsingle skeleton.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, to which this mound furnished one of a very few\r\nexceptions, whatever occurs in the mounds, whether they be sepulchral\r\nor sacrificial in their purposes, is deposited immediately beneath\r\nthe apex and on a level with the circumjacent plain.[105] The\r\npredominance of storms from a certain direction, and various other\r\ncircumstances, may have contributed to alter the apparent centre of\r\nthe mound. In the case of a mound of this kind which was opened at\r\nGallipolis on the Ohio river, the skeleton was found in a «cist»,\r\nor chamber, excavated beneath the original surface. This can always\r\nbe detected by a strongly marked line and the uniform drab color of\r\nthe earth below it. The superstructure of the mounds is more or less\r\nmottled, as the materials entering into their composition are variant\r\nin character and color,—a circumstance which has elsewhere been\r\nsufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal layer is a frequent though by no means an invariable\r\nfeature in mounds of this class, and would seem to indicate that\r\nsacrifices were made for the dead, or funeral rites of some\r\ndescription, in which fire performed a part, celebrated. This is\r\nfurther confirmed by the fact that fragments of bones and some few\r\nstone implements have been discovered in the layer of charcoal. The\r\nfire in every case was kept burning for a very little time, as is\r\nshown from the lack of ashes, and by the slight traces of its action\r\nleft on the adjacent earth. That it was suddenly heaped over while\r\nglowing, is also certain.\r\n\r\nA smaller mound, standing close by the one above described, was also\r\nexcavated, but without any satisfactory results. It is probable the\r\ninvestigation was not sufficiently thorough. [p164]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nFig. 52. This tumulus, selected as a type of the second description\r\nof sepulchral mounds, is situated upon the broad and beautiful\r\nterrace on which Chillicothe stands; about one mile to the north of\r\nthat town.[106] It is fifteen feet in height by sixty-five or seventy\r\nfeet base, and is composed of earth taken up from the surrounding\r\nplain. A shaft eight feet square was sunk from the apex. Nothing\r\nworthy of remark was observed in the progress of the excavation,\r\nuntil the skeleton at the base of the mound was reached. It was\r\ndeposited with its head towards the south; and, unlike the one above\r\ndescribed, had been simply enveloped in bark, instead of having been\r\nenclosed in a chamber of timbers. The course of preparation for the\r\nburial seemed to have been as follows: The surface of the ground\r\nwas first carefully levelled and packed, over an area perhaps ten\r\nor fifteen feet square. This area was then covered with sheets of\r\nbark, on which, in the centre, the body of the dead was deposited,\r\nwith a few articles of stone at its side, and a few small ornaments\r\nnear the head. It was then covered over with another layer of bark,\r\nand the mound heaped above. This skeleton was better preserved\r\nthan the one last mentioned, but not sufficiently well to be of\r\nmuch value for purposes of comparison. The skull was found broken\r\ninto small fragments and completely flattened beneath the weight\r\nof the mound, which had been so great as to imbed the bones in the\r\noriginal level; so that, when the fragments were removed, a nearly\r\nperfect mould of the skeleton was exhibited. The subject had been\r\na man of the ordinary size, not exceeding five feet ten inches in\r\nheight. The lower maxillary or jaw-bone, wanting the «condyles»,\r\nwas recovered. It exhibited some remarkable features, which will\r\nbe noticed elsewhere. The articles found with the skeleton were\r\nfew in number, and consisted of a stone tube and a stone implement\r\nor ornament, designed probably for suspension. The latter is three\r\ninches [p165] long, one and a half broad, and three fourths of an\r\ninch in thickness, and weighs five ounces. Both articles are composed\r\nof a compact limestone, the surface of which was originally highly\r\npolished. Near the head of the skeleton were found a couple of\r\nbear’s teeth which, from their position, were probably used as ear\r\nornaments. Just at the head and also at the foot of the skeleton had\r\nbeen placed a small stick of timber, probably to retain the covering\r\nof bark in its place. That the envelope of the skeleton, in this\r\ncase, was bark and not matting, was shown from the texture of the\r\nmaterial, which was distinctly to be traced in the decomposed mass,\r\nas well as from other circumstances. From certain indications, it\r\nwas, at first, thought the bark in the vicinity of the skeleton had\r\nbeen painted of a red color, as portions adhered to the bones, giving\r\nthem a reddish tinge. This probably resulted from other and natural\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal layer was not observed in this mound, though it may\r\nhave existed to one side or the other of the excavation. Several\r\nother large mounds occur on the plain in the vicinity of the one here\r\ndescribed, a number of which were examined with similar results.\r\nIt may be observed that in most instances, in mounds of this\r\ndescription, the skeleton is found enveloped in bark or matting,\r\n(it is difficult in some cases to decide which,) instead of being\r\nenclosed in a chamber of timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nFig. 54 exhibits a section of a mound in which burial by fire had\r\nbeen practised.[107] It is situated within the corporate limits\r\nof the city of Chillicothe, and was originally above twenty-five\r\nfeet in height, though now reduced to about twenty. The customary\r\nshaft was sunk from its apex. At six feet below the surface a layer\r\nof charcoal, corresponding in all respects with that described in\r\nconnection with the first example of mounds of this class, was\r\nfound. It was placed a little to the eastern side of the mound, a\r\ncircumstance not shown in the figure, which exhibits a section from\r\nnorth to south. Upon the original level of the earth was found a\r\ndeposit or layer of charcoal and ashes six or eight feet square and\r\nfrom six inches to a foot in thickness. In this layer were discovered\r\nfragments of human bones; a stone hand-axe; several thin pieces\r\nof copper which had been worked into shape; and also a number of\r\nstones of the harder and less common kinds, fragments of sienite,\r\ngneiss, etc. The stone hand-axe here obtained, it is a remarkable\r\nfact, is the only one which has been recovered from the mounds,\r\nwhich incontestibly belonged to [p166] the builders. Several of\r\nlike character have nevertheless been found elsewhere. It is figured\r\nunder the head of «Implements». The fire in this case had been a\r\nstrong one, as is evidenced from the fact that the skeleton had\r\nhere been almost entirely consumed. That it had also been heaped\r\nover while burning, was shown by the charcoal, which was coarse and\r\nclear, and by the baking of the earth immediately above it. In some\r\ninstances, in which burial by incremation has been practised, the\r\nentire skeleton is traceable. In such cases it has been observed\r\nthat the charcoal occurs beneath as well as above the skeleton,\r\ndemonstrating that the body had been placed upon a pyre of some sort\r\nbefore burning. Remains of art, for obvious reasons, are not abundant\r\nin this description of sepulchral mounds; nor is the supplementary\r\ncharcoal layer of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe gradual slope, resembling a graded way, upon the southern side of\r\nthis mound, is a feature not easily explained. It would seem at first\r\nglance to be designed as a passage to the top. The more probable\r\nconclusion however is, that it is a supplementary mound, which by\r\ncultivation and the lapse of time has become so merged in the larger\r\none at its side as not to be distinguishable from it. Sepulchral\r\nmounds of various sizes, joining and running into each other, are\r\ncommon. This mound is nearer to enclosures than any other of the\r\nclass yet examined.\r\n\r\nMounds of this, as well as of the first class, were often disturbed\r\nby the later Indians. Their remains are frequently found, in some\r\ncases in large quantities, as if the mound had been used for a long\r\nperiod as a general burial-place. Such was the case with a large\r\nmound, situated six miles above the town of Chillicothe, in which\r\na great number of burials had been made, at various depths, from\r\neighteen inches to four feet. The skeletons were, in places, two\r\nor three deep, and placed without arrangement in respect to each\r\nother. Some were evidently of a more ancient date than others,\r\nshowing, from their condition as well as position, that they had\r\nbeen deposited at different periods. One or two were observed in\r\nwhich the skull had been fractured by blows from a hatchet or other\r\ninstrument, establishing that the individual had met a violent death.\r\nWith some, rude vessels of pottery, and stone and bone implements,\r\nhad been deposited; and, in a small mound close by, a «silver\r\ncross», of French origin, was discovered,—all going to establish the\r\ncomparatively recent date of these burials. In sinking a shaft five\r\nfeet square, no less than «seven» skeletons, the lowest about four\r\nfeet from the surface, were exposed. Beneath all of these, at the\r\ndepth of fourteen feet and near the base of the mound, were found\r\ntraces of the «original deposit» of the mound-builders. In this\r\ncase, had the investigation been less complete, it might have been\r\nconcluded that this mound was a grand receptacle of the dead, and\r\n“contained many thousand human skeletons.” Another proof is here\r\nfurnished of the necessity of thoroughness in explorations of this\r\ncharacter, in order to arrive at correct conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of interment, so far as we are enabled to deduce\r\nthem from these monuments, were conducted with great regularity and\r\nsystem. None of those disturbances mentioned by various writers,\r\nwhere the remains seem to have been heaped together without order\r\nand without care, have been observed in the course of these\r\ninvestigations, except in cases where recent deposits had been made.\r\n[p167] On the contrary, all the circumstances seem to indicate that\r\nburial was a solemn and deliberate rite, regulated by fixed customs\r\nof, perhaps, religious or superstitious origin. It is possible that\r\nin certain cases, a special practice was prescribed. We may thus\r\naccount for the presence or absence of the charcoal layers, and\r\nalso for the practice of incremation in some instances and simple\r\ninhumation in others.[108]\r\n\r\nIn a very few of the sepulchral mounds, a rude enclosure of stone\r\nwas placed around the skeleton, corresponding to that of timber in\r\nothers. No mounds possessing this peculiarity fell under notice\r\nduring the investigations here recorded: there can, however, be\r\nno doubt of the fact. A mound within the limits of Chillicothe\r\nwas removed a number of years since, in which a stone coffin,\r\ncorresponding very nearly with the «kistvaen» of the English\r\nantiquaries, was discovered. The stones are said to have been laid up\r\nwith great regularity.[109] In some instances a pile of stones seems\r\nto have been heaped carelessly over the skeleton; in others it was\r\nheaped upon the timbers covering the sepulchral chamber, as in the\r\nmound at Grave creek.\r\n\r\n«Urn burial» does not seem to have been practised in the valley of\r\nthe Ohio. It is nevertheless undoubted that in some of the Southern\r\nStates, by either the ancient races or the more modern Indians,\r\nburials of this character were frequent. This is sufficiently\r\nestablished by the discovery in the mounds and elsewhere, of earthen\r\nvessels containing human remains, generally but not always burned. In\r\nthe mounds on the Wateree river, near Camden, South Carolina, ranges\r\nof vases, filled with human remains, were discovered. A detailed\r\naccount of these is given by Dr. Blanding, in a preceding chapter.\r\n(See page 106.) When unburnt, the skeletons seem to have been packed\r\nin the vase, after the flesh had decomposed. Sometimes, when the\r\nmouth of the vase is small, the skull is placed, face downwards, in\r\nthe opening, constituting a sort of cover. Entire cemeteries have\r\nbeen found, in which urn burial alone seems to have been practised.\r\nSuch a one was accidentally discovered, not many years since, in St.\r\nCatharine’s island, on the coast of Georgia. The vases were coarse\r\nin material, of rude workmanship, from eighteen to twenty inches\r\nin height, and filled with burned human bones. One of the vases\r\nfrom this locality is now deposited in the museum of the Georgia\r\nHistorical Society.[110] [p168]\r\n\r\nThe relics of art found in these mounds possess great uniformity of\r\ncharacter. Personal ornaments are most common, such as bracelets,\r\nperforated plates of copper, and beads of bone, ivory, shell, or\r\nmetal. Few weapons, such as spear or arrow points, are found; stone\r\nimplements are more common. Many of these articles are identical\r\nwith those found in mounds of the first class. Plates of mica\r\nare of frequent occurrence; they are sometimes of large size and\r\nconsiderable thickness. Instances are known in which this material\r\nhas been found in vast quantities, dispersed over and sometimes\r\ncompletely covering the skeleton. It seems not unlikely that a degree\r\nof superstitious regard attached to it, or that it was sacred to\r\ncertain purposes. The plates are often cut into regular figures,\r\ndiscs, ovals, etc. Vases of pottery are occasionally, but not often,\r\nfound. Of all these varieties of relics appropriate notice will be\r\ntaken in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nIn all of the sepulchral mounds opened and examined in the course\r\nof these investigations, with a single exception, the human remains\r\nhave been found so much decayed as to render any attempt to restore\r\nthe skull, or indeed any portion of the skeleton, entirely hopeless.\r\nWith this experience, it is considered extremely doubtful whether any\r\nof the numerous skulls which have been sent abroad and exhibited as\r\nundoubted remains of the mound-builders, were really such. A few are\r\npossibly genuine; this can only be determined by a full understanding\r\nof the circumstances under which they were obtained. The fact that\r\nthey were found in the mounds, in view of the variety of deposits\r\nwhich have been made at different periods, is hardly presumptive\r\nevidence that they belonged to the builders.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the earth around these skeletons is wonderfully\r\ncompact and dry, and that the conditions for their preservation are\r\nexceedingly favorable, while they are in fact so much decayed, we\r\nmay form some approximate estimate of their remote antiquity. In\r\nthe barrows of the ancient Britons, entire well-preserved skeletons\r\nare found, although possessing an undoubted antiquity of at least\r\neighteen hundred years. Local causes may produce singular results,\r\nin particular instances, but we speak now of these remains in the\r\naggregate.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed, that, as a general rule, each mound was\r\nraised over a single individual. The mound at Grave creek furnishes\r\nthe only exception to the remark within the range of our observation.\r\nThe mounds of the Southern States are probably of different\r\nconstruction, and some of them may perhaps be regarded as general\r\ncemeteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.—GREAT MOUND AT GRAVE CREEK.]\r\n\r\nThe Grave creek mound, although it has often been described,\r\ndeserves, from its size and singularity of construction, more than\r\na passing notice. It is situated on the plain, at the junction of\r\nGrave creek and the Ohio river, twelve miles below Wheeling, in the\r\nState of Virginia. It occurs in connection with various works now\r\nmuch obliterated, but is not enclosed by circumvallations. It is one\r\nof the largest in the Ohio valley; measuring about seventy feet in\r\nheight, by one thousand [p169] in circumference at the base. It was\r\nexcavated by the proprietor in 1838. He sank a shaft from the apex\r\nof the mound to the base, («b a», Fig. 55,) intersecting it at that\r\npoint by a horizontal drift («a e e»). It was found to contain two\r\nsepulchral chambers, one at the base, («a»,) and another thirty feet\r\nabove («c»). These chambers had been constructed of logs, and covered\r\nwith stones, which had sunk under the superincumbent mass as the wood\r\ndecayed, giving the summit of the mound a flat or rather dish-shaped\r\nform.[111] The lower chamber contained two human skeletons (one\r\nof which was thought to be that of a female); the upper chamber\r\ncontained but one skeleton in an advanced stage of decay. With these\r\nwere found between three and four thousand shell beads, a number\r\nof ornaments of mica, several bracelets of copper, and various\r\narticles carved in stone. After the excavation of the mound, a light\r\nthree-story wooden structure was erected upon its summit. It is\r\nindicated by «b» in the section. [p170]\r\n\r\nIn respect to the number of sepulchral chambers and enclosed\r\nskeletons, this mound is quite extraordinary. It may be conjectured\r\nwith some show of reason, that it contained the bones of the family\r\nof a chieftain, or distinguished individual among the tribes of the\r\nbuilders.\r\n\r\nIt is common to find two or three, sometimes four or five, sepulchral\r\nmounds in a group. In such cases it is always to be remarked that one\r\nof the group is much the largest, twice or three times the dimensions\r\nof any of the others; and that the smaller ones, of various sizes,\r\nare arranged around its base, generally joining it, thus evincing a\r\ndesigned dependence and intimate relation between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nPlans of three groups of this description are herewith presented,\r\nFig. 57.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1 is situated six miles below Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio.\r\nThe relative sizes, positions, etc., of the mounds composing it, are\r\nindicated in the plan. The largest is twenty-seven feet high; the\r\nrest range from four to ten feet in height. [p171]\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2 occurs upon the plain in the immediate vicinity of\r\nChillicothe, and is numbered 4 in the Map of a section of the Scioto\r\nvalley, Plate II. The small one indicated by the letter «j» was\r\nexcavated, and found to contain the skeleton of a girl enveloped in\r\nbark, in the manner already described. The largest of the group is\r\nabout thirty feet in height.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 3 is situated in Pike county, Ohio, and is indicated in the\r\nplan of the “Graded Way” near Piketon, Plate XXXI.\r\n\r\nSomething like this arrangement was observed by Com. WILKES, in the\r\nmounds of Oregon. They occurred in groups of five, as shown in Fig.\r\n58,—the largest occupying the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nMay we not conclude that these groups are family tombs; the principal\r\nmound containing the head of the family, the smaller ones its various\r\nmembers? In the case of the Grave creek mound, it is possible that,\r\ninstead of building an additional mound, a supplementary chamber\r\nwas constructed upon a mound already raised,—a single mound being\r\nthus made to fill the place of a group. This suggestion derives\r\nsome support from the fact that the second chamber is placed, above\r\nthe lower vault, at about the usual height of the larger sepulchral\r\nmounds.[112]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the mounds were the sole cemeteries\r\nof the race that built them. They were probably erected only over\r\nthe bodies of the chieftains and priests, perhaps also over the\r\nashes of distinguished families. The graves of the great mass of the\r\nancient people who thronged our valleys, and the silent monuments\r\nof whose toil are seen on every hand, were not thus signalized.\r\nWe scarcely know where to turn to find them. Every day the plough\r\nuncovers crumbling remains; but they elicit no remark,—are passed\r\nby and forgotten. The wasting banks of our rivers occasionally\r\ndisplay extensive cemeteries, but sufficient attention has never\r\nbeen bestowed upon them to enable us to speak with any degree of\r\ncertainty of their date, or to distinguish whether they belonged to\r\nthe mound-builders or a subsequent race. These cemeteries are often\r\nof such extent, as to give a name to the locality in which they\r\noccur. Thus we hear, on the Wabash, of the “Big Bone Bank,” and the\r\n“Little Bone Bank,” from which, it is represented, the river annually\r\nwashes many human skeletons, accompanied by numerous and singular\r\nremains of art, among which are more particularly mentioned vases and\r\nother vessels of pottery, of remarkable and often fantastic form.\r\nAt various places in the States north of the Ohio, thousands of\r\ngraves are said to occur, placed in ranges parallel to each other.\r\nThe extensive cemeteries of Tennessee and Missouri have often been\r\nmentioned, and it has been conjectured that the caves of Kentucky\r\nand Ohio were grand depositories of the dead of the ancient people.\r\nWe have, however, nothing at all satisfactory upon the subject,\r\n[p172] which still continues to invite investigation. It is not\r\nimprobable that many of the dead were burned, and that their ashes\r\nwere heaped together, constituting mounds. Such an inference may not\r\nunreasonably be drawn from certain facts which will be presented when\r\nwe come to speak of the anomalous or unclassified mounds. It may\r\nhowever be remarked in this connection, that no very distinct traces\r\nof the ancient burial-places can be expected to be found. If, from\r\nthe mounds where, from their protection from the action of moisture\r\nand other decomposing causes, the enclosed remains would be most\r\nlikely to be well preserved, it is found almost impossible to recover\r\na single entire bone, it is not to be wondered at that the remains\r\nof the common dead are now nearly or quite undistinguishable from\r\nthe mould which surrounds them. The apparent absence therefore of\r\nany general cemeteries of the era of the mounds, may be regarded as\r\nanother and strong evidence of the remote antiquity of the monuments\r\nof the West.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked before proceeding further, that the position\r\nof the mound-skeletons, in respect to the east or any other point of\r\nthe compass, is never fixed. They are nearly always found disposed\r\nat length, with their arms carefully adjusted at their sides. None\r\nhave been discovered in a sitting posture, except among the recent\r\ndeposits; and, even among these, no uniformity exists: some are\r\nextended at length, others lie upon their sides bent nearly double,\r\nothers still in a sitting posture; and in a few cases it seems that\r\nthe bones, after the decomposition of the flesh, had been rudely\r\nhuddled together in a narrow grave.[113]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] Numbered 1, in the “Map of a section of twelve miles of the\r\nScioto valley,” Plate II.\r\n\r\n[105] “In the investigation of barrows, marks of interment are\r\nfrequently found near the surface; but investigation must not\r\nterminate upon such a discovery. Experience has convinced me that\r\nthese were subsequent interments, and that the primary deposit was\r\n«always laid on the floor of the barrow, or within a cist in the\r\nnative soil»”—«Sir R. C. Hoare on the Barrows and Tumuli of Great\r\nBritain».\r\n\r\n[106] Numbered 2 in Map Plate II.\r\n\r\n[107] Numbered 3 in the Map, Plate II\r\n\r\n[108] Among the ancient Mexicans the dead were burned, except in\r\ncases where death had been caused by leprosy or other incurable\r\ndisease of that order. Boys under seventeen years of age were also\r\ndenied that sacred rite. The Hurons, on the other hand, burned the\r\nbodies of those who had been drowned or killed by lightning.\r\n\r\n[109] This feature was remarked by Mr. LESUEUR, in some of the mounds\r\nopened by him, in the vicinity of New Harmony, Indiana. He found, at\r\nthe base of several, a level space, upon which was a right-angled,\r\noblong parallelogram, formed of flat stones, set edgewise and\r\ncovered over with similar stones. Some decayed bones were found in\r\nthem.—«Travels in North America by Prince Maximilian», p. 80.\r\n\r\n[110] Rev. WM. B. STEVENS, Athens, Ga.\r\n\r\n[111] In the construction of this mound the builders had availed\r\nthemselves of a small natural elevation, above which the tumulus was\r\nraised. The vault «a» had been sunk in this elevation. It was an\r\nexact parallelogram, constructed by setting upright timbers around\r\nthe sides and covering these with logs placed horizontally, above\r\nwhich were piled a quantity of loose stones. The second vault appears\r\nto have been smaller than the first, but corresponded with it in\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nFor detailed descriptions of this mound and its contents, see an\r\naccount by Dr. CLEMENS, published in 1839, in «Morton’s Crania\r\nAmericana», p. 221; by the proprietor of the mound, Mr. TOMLINSON, in\r\nthe «American Pioneer» for 1843, vol. ii. pp. 195–203; and by HENRY\r\nR. SCHOOLCRAFT, Esq., in the first volume of the «Transactions of the\r\nAmerican Ethnological Society», 1846.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that some discrepancies exist between these\r\nseveral accounts. That of Dr. Clemens, which is the earliest,\r\nstates that in carrying in the horizontal excavation, “at the\r\ndistance of twelve or fifteen feet, were found numerous masses\r\ncomposed of charcoal and burnt bones. Before reaching the centre, a\r\npassage-way was discovered to a vault at the base; this passage had\r\nan inclination of ten or fifteen degrees, and had been covered with\r\ntimbers, of which the impression in the earth alone remained. The\r\nvault itself appeared to have been covered with timbers and loose\r\nstones. After removing all the rubbish from the vault, two skeletons\r\nwere found, one on the east, the other on the west side. The former\r\nwas the smaller and more perfect of the two. * * * On reaching the\r\nlower vault from the top it was determined to enlarge it for the\r\naccommodation of visitors. In so doing ten more skeletons were\r\ndiscovered, all in a sitting posture, but in so fragile a state as to\r\ndefy all attempts at preservation.”\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested, that the smaller or female skeleton in the\r\nvault, as well as those surrounding it, were the remains of victims\r\nsacrificed, in accordance with barbarian practice, as attendants in\r\nthe world of spirits upon the chieftain, in honor of whom this mound\r\nwas erected. This practice was common among the Natchez, Mexicans,\r\nPeruvians, and other aboriginal nations.\r\n\r\n[112] The barrows denominated the “Bell Barrows,” of England, are\r\nthought, by English antiquarians, to be a modification of the “Bowl\r\nBarrow,” formed by placing a new top upon the latter, and otherwise\r\nenlarging it, for the purpose of fresh interment. It is common in\r\nthis description of barrows, to find one burial above the other, as\r\nat Grave creek.\r\n\r\n[113] The North American Indians, in their burials by inhumation,\r\nvery generally placed the body in a sitting posture. Their customs\r\nof burial were, however, extremely variant. Some of the tribes to\r\nthis day, after enveloping the bodies of their dead, place them\r\non scaffolds or in the forks of trees. Among some of the Southern\r\nIndians, they were exposed until the flesh parted from the bones,\r\nwhich were then gathered with various ceremonies and deposited in\r\nthe huts of the relatives, the temples of the tribe, “the medicine\r\nhouse,” or in buildings specially dedicated to the purpose. The\r\nMexicans, in cases where burial by inhumation was practised, placed\r\ntheir dead in a sitting position: so too did the Central Americans\r\nand Peruvians, as is sufficiently evidenced by an examination\r\nof their tombs. It is a great mistake, however, to suppose that\r\nthe custom was anything like universal either among the ancient\r\ninhabitants of more recent tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p173]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII.\r\n EARTHWORKS—TEMPLE MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.—TERRACED MOUND.]\r\n\r\nThese mounds are distinguished by their great regularity of form\r\nand general large dimensions. They occur most usually within, but\r\nsometimes without, the walls of enclosures. They consist chiefly\r\nof pyramidal structures, truncated, and generally having graded\r\navenues to their tops. In some instances they are terraced, or have\r\nsuccessive stages. But whatever their form, whether round, oval,\r\noctangular, square, or oblong, they have invariably flat or level\r\ntops, of greater or less area. Examples are known in which, although\r\nbut a few feet in elevation, they cover several acres of ground; in\r\nwhich cases they are commonly called “platforms.”\r\n\r\nMounds of this class are not numerous in Ohio, and it is believed are\r\nonly found at Marietta, Newark, Portsmouth, and in the vicinity of\r\nChillicothe. These are all described, and their predominant features\r\nillustrated, in the accounts of the works at the several points where\r\nthey occur, to which attention is directed. (See Plates XVIII, XXV,\r\nXXVI.) Those at Marietta are situated within an enclosure; those at\r\nNewark and near Chillicothe, in close connection with small circles\r\nupon which they seem to have some degree of dependence. So far as\r\nascertained, they cover no remains, and seem obviously designed as\r\nthe sites of temples or of other structures which have passed away,\r\nor as “high places” for the performance of certain ceremonies. The\r\nlikeness which they bear to the «Teocallis» of Mexico is striking,\r\nand suggestive of their probable purposes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pyramidal structures here noticed, there are\r\nothers somewhat [p174] different in their forms, but which were\r\nundoubtedly appropriated to the same purpose. The mound embraced\r\nin the circular work connected with the Portsmouth group, is an\r\nexample. (See Plate XXVIII.) Though much defaced, its original\r\nplan can easily be made out. It is circular, placed on a terrace,\r\nis truncated, and has a spiral pathway leading to its summit. The\r\npurpose already assigned to it, viz. that of a site for a temple, or\r\na “high place” for the performance of ceremonies probably connected\r\nwith the superstitions of the ancient people, is indicated not less\r\nby the peculiarities of its construction, than by the character of\r\nthe enclosure in which it is situated.\r\n\r\nThe feature of truncation is not, however, peculiar to this class of\r\nmounds. It is frequently observed in those which, upon investigation,\r\nare found to be sepulchral in their character; in which cases it is\r\nto be attributed to the falling in of the sepulchral chambers. This\r\ncircumstance gave the summit of the Grave creek Mound a hollow or\r\ndish-shaped form, which was a source of much conjecture, until the\r\nexcavation of the mound explained the cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nAlong the Mississippi river, and especially as we approach the Gulf,\r\nthese regular structures increase both in number and magnitude. In\r\nKentucky they are more frequent than in the States north of the Ohio\r\nriver; and in Tennessee and Mississippi they are still more abundant.\r\nSome of the largest, however, occur in pretty high latitudes. The\r\ngreat mound at Cahokia, Illinois, is one of the most remarkable.\r\nIt has often been described, and all accounts concur in respect\r\nto its great size. The following approximate plan will serve to\r\ngive an idea of its general outline. It is of course much rounded,\r\nand its regularity to a great degree destroyed, by the storms and\r\nchanges of centuries; its original plan is, however, represented to\r\nbe still sufficiently obvious. The form of the mound is that of a\r\nparallelogram, seven hundred feet long by five hundred wide at the\r\nbase. It is ninety feet in height. Upon one side is a broad apron\r\nor terrace, which is reached by a graded ascent. At the time this\r\nmound was occupied by the monks of La Trappe, the terrace was used\r\nas a garden. It is one hundred and sixty feet wide and three hundred\r\nand fifty long; the summit or highest part of the mound (A) measures\r\ntwo hundred feet in width by four hundred and fifty in length.\r\nHere formerly stood a broad, low mound, which was disturbed in\r\npreparing the foundations of a dwelling house. Within it were found\r\nhuman bones, and various implements of stone and pottery, probably\r\nbelonging to a recent deposit. This mound covers not far from eight\r\nacres of ground, and the area of its level summit is about five\r\nacres. Its solid contents may be roughly estimated at twenty millions\r\nof cubic feet.[114] A number of similar mounds, though of less size,\r\noccur in this [p175] vicinity, and others still exist near the city\r\nof St. Louis.[115] Mounds of this class are sometimes surrounded by\r\nlow embankments of earth. A fine example is furnished by the large\r\nconical mound at Marietta, of which a view is elsewhere given.\r\nAnother occurs on the Virginia shore of the Ohio, nearly opposite the\r\nhead of Blennerhassett’s Island (Fig. 61). It is lozenge-shaped, and\r\nis surrounded by a wall and ditch.[116]\r\n\r\nSome very remarkable mounds of this class occur in Kentucky, on the\r\n“Long Bottom” of Cumberland river, in Adair county; also near Cadiz,\r\nTrigg county; near Mount Sterling, and in Hickman and McCracken\r\ncounties. In Whiteby county is one three hundred and sixty feet long,\r\none hundred and fifty wide, and twelve high, with graded ascents; and\r\nat Hopkinsville, Christian county, is one of great size, upon which\r\nthe court-house is built.\r\n\r\nIn Bradford county, Tennessee, several extensive terraces or\r\nplatforms of earth are said to exist, one of which is represented to\r\ncover three acres. Six miles south-west of Paris, Henry county, is a\r\nterrace four or five feet high and two hundred feet square. It serves\r\nas the site of a dwelling. Similar ones are numerous on Old Town\r\ncreek, nine or ten miles westward of Paris. There are others on the\r\nbanks of the Cumberland river between Palmyra and Clarkesville, and\r\na number occur in the vicinity of Knoxville. Some of large size are\r\nfound in Missouri, at New Madrid, St. Genevieve and other places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nFig. 62. A section from east to west of a large mound in Clarke\r\ncounty, Tennessee, not far from Claiborne. It is situated on a hill,\r\nand is fifty feet in height by four hundred and fifty in diameter at\r\nthe base. It is truncated, and has a level area at its summit about\r\none hundred feet in circumference. It is also terraced and has ten\r\nstages, each of which is not far from five feet above the other. The\r\nterraces are covered with turf; but the slopes exhibit the naked\r\nwhite clay of which the mound is composed. The stages are interrupted\r\non the eastern side, where there is a graded ascent.[117] [p176]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nFig. 63. This remarkable mound or terrace occurs near Lovedale,\r\nWoodford county, Kentucky. It is octagonal in form, measuring one\r\nhundred and fifty feet on each side. It has three graded ascents, one\r\nat each of the northern angles and one at the middle of the western\r\nside. It is but little more than five feet in height. Upon it are two\r\nconical mounds, as shown in the plan, and also the dwelling house\r\nof the proprietor. Some distance to the northward of this terrace\r\nare a number of large and deep pits, from which the material for its\r\nconstruction was probably taken.[118]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nFig. 64. The plan of this mound or terrace sufficiently explains its\r\ncharacter. It is situated three miles from Washington, Mason county,\r\nKentucky. Its height is ten feet.[119]\r\n\r\nNo sooner do we arrive in the Southern States, than we find these\r\nTeocalli-shaped structures constituting the most numerous and\r\nimportant portion of the ancient remains. They preserve very nearly\r\nthe same form with those already described, but are generally of\r\ngreater size, and enter into many new combinations. Examples of a\r\nconsiderable number have already been given in the chapter on the\r\n“Monuments of the Southern States.” Here they often occur entirely\r\nseparate from enclosures of any sort, and are frequently placed with\r\na great deal of regularity in respect to each other. It sometimes\r\nhappens that a large truncated mound is surrounded by a series\r\nof smaller ones, so as to form an ellipse, circle, square, or\r\nparallelogram.[120] In some instances the various mounds of a group\r\nare connected with each other by raised ways or terraces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nMany of the temple mounds of the South are circular; most have graded\r\nascents, and a few have a low wall enclosing the level area at their\r\ntops. In Macon and Cherokee counties, North Carolina, quite a number,\r\nanswering to this description, are said to exist. A very remarkable\r\none occurs near the town of Franklin, on the Tennessee river, and\r\nanother not far from the town of Murphy, on Valley [p177] river.\r\nThey are from twelve to fifteen feet high and of proportionate base.\r\nTheir form is best illustrated by the accompanying engraving, Fig.\r\n65. There are no enclosures in the vicinity of these works. It is\r\nsaid the Indians formerly built their council houses upon them.\r\n\r\nSome of these circular mounds, as we have seen in a previous\r\nchapter, were ascended by spiral pathways, winding round them, as\r\nround a shaft, from base to summit. Indeed, it would be impossible\r\nto describe all the various forms which these structures assume;\r\ntheir general character is however sufficiently illustrated by the\r\npreceding examples.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the temple mounds of the South have other\r\nmounds upon their summits. This is especially the case with the\r\nlarge pyramidal structures. An example is furnished in the great\r\nSeltzertown mound, which is covered with a number of smaller ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.—GROUP OF SEPULCHRAL MOUNDS]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] Notes on the Antiquities of the Mississippi Valley, by H.

It is well known as Mount Joliet. It appears,\r\nhowever, from all direct information that can be gathered concerning\r\nit, that it is simply a natural eminence of regular outline. So far\r\nas we are informed, there are no traces of a great ancient population\r\nin that vicinity, such as we almost invariably find accompanying the\r\nmore imposing aboriginal monuments.\r\n\r\n[116] On the authority of Charles Sullivan, Esq., Marietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[117] The description of this mound is from the RAFINESQUE MSS. The\r\nsection purports to have been made by a Mr. Ewing.\r\n\r\n[118] RAFINESQUE MSS. The survey of this singular monument purports\r\nto have been made in 1820. The then proprietor was a Mr. Ship, the\r\nposition of whose residence is shown in the plan.\r\n\r\n[119] RAFINESQUE MSS., 1818.\r\n\r\n[120] Mounds placed in this manner are of occasional occurrence in\r\nthe more northern States. Examples have been remarked in Illinois\r\nand Missouri. Twelve miles south-west of the town of Glasgow, Barren\r\ncounty, Kentucky, a group is found. The mounds are small, oval,\r\nand placed at intervals of about fifty yards, so as to constitute\r\na circle of perhaps fifteen hundred feet in circumference. In\r\nthe centre of the circular area is a large mound between twenty\r\nand thirty feet in height. These mounds appear to have sustained\r\nstructures of some kind.—«Collins’s Kentucky», p. 176.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p178]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX.\r\n ANOMALOUS MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the mounds already described, the purposes of which seem\r\npretty clearly indicated, there are many which will admit of no\r\nclassification. Some of them possess features in common with all\r\nclasses, and seem to have been appropriated to a double purpose;\r\nwhile others, in our present state of knowledge concerning them,\r\nare entirely inexplicable. As these mounds differ individually from\r\neach other, it is of course impossible to present anything like a\r\ngeneral view of their character. We can therefore only describe a\r\nfew of the more remarkable, dismissing the remainder with the single\r\nobservation that their features do not indicate any specific design,\r\nand are not sufficiently distinct or uniform to justify or sustain a\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular of these mounds, and one which best\r\nillustrates the remark that certain mounds were probably made to\r\nsubserve a double purpose, is situated within a large enclosure on\r\nthe east bank of the Scioto river. (Marked «c e», Plate XX.) A plan\r\nand section of the mound are herewith presented (Fig. 67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nIt is an irregular oval in form, and is one hundred and sixty feet\r\nlong, ninety broad at its larger end, and twenty feet in height.\r\nExcavations were made at the points indicated in the section. The one\r\ntowards the right or smaller end of the mound disclosed an enclosure\r\nof timber, eight feet square, and similar, in all respects, to those\r\nfound in the sepulchral mounds, except that, in this instance, posts\r\neight inches in diameter had been planted at the outer corners, as\r\nif to sustain the structure. These posts had been inserted eighteen\r\ninches in the [p179] original level or floor of the mound. The holes\r\nleft by their decay were found filled with decomposed material; when\r\nthis was removed, they exhibited perfect «casts» of the timbers.\r\nThe casts also of the horizontal timbers were well retained in the\r\ncompact earth, and one of the workmen, without much difficulty, was\r\nenabled to creep more than half the way around the enclosure which\r\nthey had formed. Within this chamber the earth was as firm as in any\r\nportion of the mound. Upon removing a portion, a skeleton partly\r\nburned was found, and with it a thin copper plate seven inches long\r\nand four broad, perforated with two small holes; also a large pipe\r\nof bold outline, carved from a dark compact porphyry (Fig. 68). The\r\nbones seemed to have been enveloped in a species of matting, which\r\nwas too much decayed to be distinctly made out. The floor of the\r\nmound, it should be mentioned, so far as explored, was composed\r\nof clay, was perfectly level, and had been burned to considerable\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.—Half size.]\r\n\r\nThe second excavation (B) was made in the larger end of the mound,\r\nsomewhat to one side of the centre, at a spot marked by a depression\r\nin the surface. At the depth of twenty feet was found an altar of\r\nclay of exceeding symmetry. This was sunk, as shown in the section,\r\nin the general level or floor of the mound, and had been surrounded\r\nby an enclosure in all respects similar to the one above described,\r\nexcept that the timbers had been less in size. A fine carbonaceous\r\ndeposit, resembling burned leaves, was found within the altar.\r\nAmongst the decayed materials of the surrounding enclosure were found\r\nseveral «skewers», if we may so term them, in lack of a better name,\r\nmade of the bones («ulna») of the deer. They were finely tapered to\r\na point, and had evidently been originally highly polished. Some\r\nwere not less than nine or ten inches long. Though apparently sound,\r\nthey were found to be exceedingly brittle, retaining little if any\r\nof their animal matter. Drifts were carried in the course shown in\r\nthe section, and the evidences of another enclosure discovered. The\r\nexcavation was suspended at this point, in consequence of heavy and\r\ncontinued rains. The holes soon became partly filled by the caving in\r\nof the loose earth near the surface; which discouraging circumstance,\r\njoined to the extreme difficulty of digging,[121] prevented a\r\nresumption of [p180] the investigation. It is very certain that\r\nanother, perhaps several other chambers are concealed by this mound.\r\n\r\nThe surface of this mound was covered with the layer of pebbles and\r\ncoarse gravel already mentioned as characterizing the mounds of\r\nthe first class; but the sand strata were absent. Around the base\r\nhad been laid, with some degree of regularity, a large quantity of\r\nflat stones, constituting a sort of wall for the better support\r\nof the earth. These stones must have been brought from the hills,\r\nwhich are here nearly half a mile distant. Why the altar as well as\r\nthe skeleton had been enclosed, and why the floor of the mound had\r\nbeen so carefully levelled, cast over with clay, and then hardened\r\nby fire, are questions which will probably remain unanswered and\r\nunexplained unless future investigations serve further to elucidate\r\nthe mystery of the mounds. At any rate, this singular mound can prove\r\nno greater puzzle to the reader than it has to the authors of these\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nA detached mound stands on the bank of Walnut creek, about three\r\nmiles below the one just described, which is entirely anomalous in\r\nits character. It is about nine feet in height by forty base. The\r\nfollowing section will best explain its construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nFig. 69. The principal portion of the mound, which is darkly shaded\r\nin the section, resembles long exposed and highly compacted ashes,\r\nand is intermingled with specks of charcoal, small bits of burned\r\nbones, and fragments of sandstone much burned. Beneath this, and\r\nforming the nucleus as it were of the entire mound, is a mass of\r\nvery pure white clay, of somewhat regular outline; but whether this\r\nregularity was accidental or designed, it is not undertaken to say.\r\nThe clay rested upon the original soil, and did not appear to have\r\nbeen subjected in any degree to the action of fire. The carbonaceous\r\ndeposit, if we may so regard it, seems from this circumstance to\r\nhave been brought here and not to have been produced by burning on\r\nthe spot. The mound could not possibly have been designed for a\r\n«look-out», inasmuch as it stands immediately at the base of the\r\ntable lands, and commands but a very limited view.\r\n\r\nTwo other mounds, numbered 6 and 7 in the map, Plate II, exhibited\r\nsome features in common with the one last mentioned, though neither\r\nhad the clay deposit at the base. After penetrating a foot or\r\ntwenty inches into these, traces of ashes and other carbonaceous\r\nmatter, with here and there small quantities of burned bones in fine\r\nfragments, became abundant,—indeed the remainder of the mound seemed\r\nentirely constituted of such materials. In some instances, if not\r\nin all, the fragments of calcined bones were of the human skeleton.\r\nIt has been suggested that these mounds were composed of the ashes\r\nof the dead, burned elsewhere, but finally thus heaped together. It\r\nis not impossible that such was the case in a few instances, though\r\nmounds possessing these features are too few in number and too small\r\nin size to justify the conclusion that such was the general custom.\r\n\r\nA number of mounds, principally within enclosures, have been\r\nexamined, which exhibited only a level, hard-packed area at their\r\nbase, thinly covered with a [p181] fine-grained, carbonaceous\r\nmaterial similar to that which is sometimes found on the altars, and\r\nwhich has several times been described as resembling burned leaves\r\nor straw. It has been suggested that sacrifices or offerings of\r\nvegetables or the “first fruits” of the year were sometimes made, of\r\nwhich these traces alone remain.\r\n\r\nIn one or two small mounds, deposits of arrow or spear points of\r\nflint have been found. The little mound No. 8 in the map, Plate II,\r\ncontained a pile in its centre of twenty or more, each one broken\r\ninto two or three pieces. They had not been exposed to the action of\r\nfire. In shape they are singular, differing materially from those\r\nusually found scattered over the fields, and are exceedingly thin and\r\nwell wrought. It is fruitless to conjecture why they were thus broken\r\nup, or why indeed the simple deposit was made at all.\r\n\r\nA few small mounds have been observed composed entirely of pebbles,\r\nof the average size of one’s fist, unmixed with earth, excepting what\r\nhad gradually accumulated over them. Several of those surrounding the\r\ngreat work on Paint creek (Plate XXI, No. 2) are of this description,\r\nand are supposed, by the residents of the vicinity, to be the\r\nmissiles of the ancient people, thus conveniently deposited for use\r\nin case of an attack upon the supposed fortress! Unfortunately for\r\nthis hypothesis, the magazines are outside of the walls.\r\n\r\nIt would prove an almost endless and perhaps an entirely unprofitable\r\ntask to describe the peculiarities of individual mounds, not\r\nreferable to either of the grand classes already noticed. Most\r\nof them appear inexplicable; not more so, however, than did the\r\nsacrificial or altar mounds when first noticed, and it is likely\r\nthat more extended investigations may also serve to explain their\r\npurposes. The examples above presented are adduced to show that,\r\nwhile the leading purposes of the mounds (of Ohio at least) have been\r\ndetected and settled, there is yet much left for future explorations\r\nto determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n MOUNDS OF OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nIt has already been several times remarked, that the most commanding\r\npositions on the hills bordering the valleys of the West, are often\r\ncrowned with mounds, generally of intermediate, but sometimes of\r\nlarge size,—suggesting at once the purposes to which some of the\r\n«cairns» or hill-mounds of the Celts were applied, namely, that of\r\nsignal or alarm posts.\r\n\r\nRanges of these mounds may be observed extending along the valleys\r\nfor many miles. Between Chillicothe and Columbus, on the eastern\r\nborder of the Scioto valley, not far from twenty may be selected, so\r\nplaced in respect to each other, that it is believed, if the country\r\nwere cleared of forests, signals of fire might be transmitted in a\r\nfew minutes along the whole line. On a hill opposite Chillicothe,\r\nnearly six hundred feet in height, the loftiest in the entire region,\r\none of [p182] these mounds is placed. After the fall of the leaves\r\nin autumn, it is a conspicuous object from every work laid down on\r\nthe Map of a section of twelve miles of the Scioto valley, to which\r\nsuch frequent reference has been made, as well as from other works\r\nnot exhibited in the map. It is indicated by the figure 5 in this\r\nmap. A fire built upon it would be distinctly visible for fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles up, and an equal distance down the valley, (including in\r\nits range the Circleville works, twenty miles distant,) as also for a\r\nlong way up the broad valleys of the two Paint creeks,—both of which\r\nabound in remains, and seem to have been especial favorites with the\r\nmound-builders. In the Map of six miles of the Miami valley, (Plate\r\nIII,) a similar feature will be observed. Upon a hill three hundred\r\nfeet in height, overlooking the Colerain work, and commanding an\r\nextensive view of the valley, are placed two mounds, which exhibit—in\r\nconnection with other circumstances not entirely consistent with the\r\nconclusion that they were simple signal-stations—strong marks of fire\r\non and around them. Similar mounds occur, at intervals, along the\r\nWabash and Illinois rivers, as also on the Upper Mississippi, the\r\nOhio, the Miamis, and the Scioto. On the high hills overlooking the\r\nPortsmouth and Marietta works, (Plates XXVI and XXVII,) mounds of\r\nstone are situated; those at the former place exhibit evident marks\r\nof fire. On the heights around the works at Grave creek in Virginia,\r\nsimilar features have been observed.[122] A trip of exploration, made\r\nwith special reference to this and kindred points, disclosed the\r\nfact that, between the mouths of the Scioto and Guyandotte rivers,\r\nthe hills upon both sides of the Ohio, for the entire distance, were\r\nstudded with mounds. Many of them, however, occurred in groups,\r\ntheir bases joining, and were placed so far back from the brow of\r\nthe hills as to be entirely invisible from the valley,—facts wholly\r\nopposed to the hypothesis which ascribes a common purpose to all of\r\nthe hill-mounds. Indeed, for the distance above specified, these\r\nmounds, though less in size, seemed quite as numerous as those in the\r\nvalley; in which, besides mounds and a few small circles, no works of\r\nmagnitude were discovered,—another fact which may not be without its\r\nimportance in this connection.\r\n\r\nSome of the hill-mounds bordering on the Ohio have been opened by\r\nexplorers, and found to contain human remains, but whether of an\r\nancient or modern date, it is difficult, from the imperfect nature of\r\nthe accounts, to determine. The remarkable mound already mentioned,\r\nsituated on the high hill near Chillicothe, was opened some twelve\r\nor fifteen years ago; and, it is said, human remains and a variety\r\nof relics were discovered in it. Although the investigation of this\r\nclass of mounds has, from a variety of causes, been comparatively\r\nlimited, yet enough has been ascertained concerning them, to justify\r\nthe belief that a large proportion contain human remains, undoubtedly\r\nthose of the mound-builders. And, although traces of fire are to be\r\nobserved around very many, the marks are not sufficiently strong to\r\nsustain the inference that all were look-outs, and that fires were\r\nkindled upon them as signals. It is not impossible that a portion\r\nwere devoted to sepulture, another portion to observation, and that\r\nsome answered a double purpose. [p183] This is a point which remains\r\nto be settled by the disclosures of the mattock and spade, and by a\r\nclose and extended observation of the dependences which exist, not\r\nonly between the hill-mounds themselves, but between them and the\r\nother monuments of the same people.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps seem, from what has been adduced, that the\r\nclassification of any portion of the hill-mounds as places of\r\nobservation, is not sufficiently well authorized. The positions\r\nhowever which many of them occupy, are such as would most naturally\r\nbe chosen for such purposes, though not necessarily for such only.\r\nThe apparent dependence which exists between some of them and the\r\nlarger earthworks would also seem to favor the idea that they were\r\nlook-outs. But whether signal-stations or otherwise, there can be\r\nno doubt that the ancient people selected prominent and elevated\r\npositions upon which to build large fires, which were kept burning\r\nfor long periods, or renewed at frequent intervals. For what purposes\r\nthey were built, whether to communicate intelligence or to celebrate\r\nsome religious rite, it is not undertaken to say.[123] The traces\r\nof these fires are only observed upon the brows of the hills: they\r\nappear to have been built generally upon heaps of stones, which\r\nare broken up and sometimes partially vitrified. In all cases they\r\nexhibit marks of intense and protracted heat. They are vulgarly\r\nsupposed to be the remains of “«furnaces»,” from the amount of\r\nscoriaceous material accompanying them, which often covers a large\r\narea, and is several feet in thickness. This popular error has led to\r\nsome very extravagant conjectures as to the former mineral wealth of\r\nthe vicinity in which they occur; an error which has been perpetuated\r\nin various works on American antiquities.\r\n\r\nThe dependence which exists between certain mounds, and the defensive\r\nstructures within or near which they are located, is too evident\r\nto admit of doubt. It has already been made a subject of remark,\r\n(page 43,) and need only be referred to here. In the case of the\r\nfortified hill, Plate VI, we find a large mound commanding the only\r\navenue leading to it, and so placed that no approach could be made\r\nunobserved from its summit. Similar dependences, perhaps still more\r\nmarked, are perceived in other works, where mounds are placed on the\r\napproaches, or at such points within or without the walls as are best\r\nadapted for observation. (See Plate XI, Nos. 1 and 2.) [p184]\r\n\r\n\r\n STONE HEAPS.\r\n\r\nRude heaps of stone, occasionally displaying some degree of\r\nregularity, are not uncommon at the West, though by no means peculiar\r\nto that section of country. It is exceedingly questionable whether\r\nany of them belong to the same era with the other works here treated\r\nof, although they are usually ascribed to the mound-builders. The\r\nstone mounds, of which mention has already been made, are very\r\ndifferent structures, and should not be confounded with these rude\r\naccumulations.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable stone-heaps observed in the course of\r\nthese investigations, is situated upon the dividing ridge between\r\nIndian and Crooked creeks, about ten miles south-west of Chillicothe,\r\nOhio. It is immediately by the side of the old Indian trail which\r\nled from the Shawanoe towns, in the vicinity of Chillicothe, to the\r\nmouth of the Scioto river; and consists of a simple heap of stones,\r\nrectangular in form, and measuring one hundred and six feet in\r\nlength by sixty in width, and between three and four in height. The\r\nstones are of all sizes, from those not larger than a man’s head,\r\nto those which can hardly be lifted. They are such as are found in\r\ngreat abundance on the hill slopes,—the fragments or «debris» of\r\nthe outcropping sandstone layers. Some are water-worn, showing that\r\nthey were brought up from the creek, nearly half a mile distant; and\r\nalthough they were disposed with no regularity in respect to each\r\nother, the heap was originally quite symmetrical in outline. The\r\nstones have been thrown out from the centre, and an excavation of\r\nconsiderable depth made in the earth beneath, but without results.\r\nThe heap is situated upon the highest point of land traversed by the\r\nIndian trail; upon the water-shed, or dividing ridge, between the\r\nstreams which flow into Brush creek on the one side, and the Scioto\r\nriver on the other.\r\n\r\nAnother heap of stones of like character, but somewhat less in size,\r\nis situated upon the top of a high, narrow hill, overlooking the\r\nsmall valley of Salt creek, near Tarlton, Pickaway county, Ohio. It\r\nis remarkable as having large numbers of crumbling human bones—to\r\nsay nothing of living black snakes—intermingled, apparently without\r\norder, with the stones. A very extensive prospect is had from this\r\npoint. Upon the slope of a lower hill near by, appears to have been\r\nformerly an Indian village. Many rude relics are uncovered on the\r\nspot, by the plough.\r\n\r\nSmaller and very irregular heaps are frequent amongst the hills. They\r\ndo not generally embrace more than a couple of cartloads of stone,\r\nand almost invariably cover a skeleton. Occasionally the amount of\r\nstones is much greater. Rude implements are sometimes found with the\r\nskeletons. A number of such graves have been observed near Sinking\r\nSprings, Highland county, Ohio; also in Adams county in the same\r\nState, and in Greenup county, Kentucky, at a point nearly opposite\r\nthe town of Portsmouth on the Ohio.\r\n\r\nHeaps of similar character are found in the Atlantic States, where\r\nthey were [p185] raised by the Indians over the bodies of those\r\nwho met their death by accident, or in the manner of whose death\r\nthere was something unusual. Dwight, in his Travels, mentions a\r\nheap of stones of this description which was raised over the body\r\nof a warrior killed by accident, on the old Indian trail between\r\nHartford and Farmington, the seat of the Tunxis Indians, in\r\nConnecticut. Traces of a similar heap still exist on the old trail\r\nbetween Schenectady and Cherry Valley in New York, with which a like\r\ntradition is connected. They were not raised at once, but were the\r\naccumulations of a long period, it being the custom for each warrior\r\nas he passed the spot to add a stone to the pile. Hence the general\r\noccurrence of these rude monuments near some frequented trail or path.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.—CONICAL MOUND.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] The difficulty of carrying on investigations in the large\r\nmounds cannot be readily appreciated. The earth is always so compact\r\nas to require, literally, to be «cut out». It has then to be raised\r\nto the surface,—a task of great labor, and only accomplished by\r\nleaving stages in the descent and throwing the earth from one to the\r\nother, and finally to the surface. Four industrious men were employed\r\nnot less than ten or twelve days in making the excavations in this\r\nmound alone.\r\n\r\n[122] Transactions of the American Ethnological Society, vol. i. p.\r\n409.\r\n\r\n[123] When Lieut. Fremont penetrated into the fastnesses of\r\nUpper California, where his appearance created great alarm among\r\nthe Indians, he observed this primitive telegraphic system in\r\noperation. “Columns of smoke rose over the country at scattered\r\nintervals,—signals by which the Indians, here as elsewhere,\r\ncommunicate to each other that enemies are in the country. It\r\nis a signal of ancient and very universal application among\r\nbarbarians.”—«Fremont’s Second Expedition», p. 220.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p186]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X.\r\n REMAINS OF ART FOUND IN THE MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the ordinary arts of life amongst a people capable\r\nof constructing the singular and imposing monuments which we have\r\nbeen contemplating, furnishes a prominent and interesting subject\r\nof inquiry. The vast amount of labor expended upon these works, and\r\nthe regularity and design which they exhibit, taken in connection\r\nwith the circumstances under which they are found, denote a people\r\nadvanced from the nomadic or radically savage state,—in short,\r\na numerous agricultural people, spread at one time, or slowly\r\nmigrating, over a vast extent of country, and having established\r\nhabits, customs, and modes of life. How far this conclusion, for the\r\npresent hypothetically advanced, is sustained by the character of the\r\nminor vestiges of art, of which we shall now speak, remains to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked, that the mounds are the principal\r\ndepositories of ancient art, and that in them we must seek for\r\nthe only authentic remains of the builders. In the observance of\r\na practice almost universal among barbarous or semi-civilized\r\nnations, the mound-builders deposited various articles of use and\r\nornament with their dead. They also, under the prescriptions of their\r\nreligion, or in accordance with customs unknown to us, and to which\r\nperhaps no direct analogy is afforded by those of any other people,\r\nplaced upon their altars numerous ornaments and implements,—probably\r\nthose most valued by their possessors,—which remain there to this\r\nday, attesting at once the religious zeal of the depositors, and\r\ntheir skill in the simpler arts. From these original sources, the\r\nillustrations which follow have been chiefly derived.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of a careful discrimination between the various\r\nremains found in the mounds, resulting from the fact that the races\r\nsucceeding the builders in the occupation of the country often buried\r\ntheir dead in them, has probably been dwelt upon with sufficient\r\nforce, in another connection. Attention to the conditions under which\r\nthey are discovered, and to the simple rules which seem to have\r\ngoverned the mound-builders in making their deposits, can hardly fail\r\nto fix with great certainty their date and origin.\r\n\r\nThus in the case of the stratified mounds, we well know, if the\r\nstrata are entire, that whatever deposits are found beneath them\r\nwere placed there at the period of the construction of the mounds\r\nthemselves. On the other hand, if they are broken up, it follows with\r\nequal certainty that the mound in which the disturbance is observed,\r\nhas been invaded since its erection.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be seen that we have some certain means of\r\ndetermining, aside from the distinctive features of the articles\r\nthemselves, which of the relics discovered [p187] in the mounds\r\npertain to their builders, and which are of a later date. Hence\r\nresults the importance of knowing the history of those relics\r\nwhich may fall under notice, and the circumstances attending their\r\ndiscovery, in order to feel authorized in drawing conclusions from\r\nthem. Their true position satisfactorily ascertained, we proceed with\r\nconfidence to comparisons and deductions, which otherwise, however\r\ningenious and accurate they might appear, would necessarily be\r\ninvested with painful uncertainty. From want of proper care in this\r\nrespect, there is no doubt that articles of European origin, which,\r\nby a very natural train of events, found their way to the mounds,\r\nhave been made the basis of speculations concerning the arts of the\r\nmound-builders. To this cause we may refer the existence of the\r\npopular errors, that the ancient people were acquainted with the uses\r\nof iron, and understood the arts of plating, gilding, etc.\r\n\r\nHence, too, the value of systematic investigations, conducted on the\r\nspot, if we would aim to throw any certain light upon this branch of\r\ninquiry, or do more than excite an ignorant wonder or gratify an idle\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThe general character of this class of remains has already been\r\nindicated. They are such only as, from the nature of their material,\r\nhave been able to resist the general course of decay:—articles of\r\npottery, bone, ivory, shell, stone, and metal. We can, of course,\r\nexpect to find no traces of instruments or utensils of wood, and\r\nbut few and doubtful ones at best, of the materials which went to\r\ncompose articles of dress. Such remains as are found, so far as their\r\npurposes are apparent, are classified; the remainder are so arranged\r\nas best to facilitate description.\r\n\r\n\r\n POTTERY AND ARTICLES OF CLAY.\r\n\r\nThe art of the potter is hoary in its antiquity. It seems to have\r\nbeen the first domestic art practised by man, and the worker in\r\nclay may be esteemed the primitive artisan. Go where we will, from\r\nthe hut of the roving Indian to the palace of the civilized prince,\r\nwe everywhere find the products of his craft, rude and unpolished\r\nfrom the hand of the savage, or rivalling the marble from the\r\nmanufactories of Wedgwood and Copeland.\r\n\r\nThe site of every Indian town throughout the West is marked by the\r\nfragments of pottery scattered around it; and the cemeteries of the\r\nvarious tribes abound with rude vessels of clay, piously deposited\r\nwith the dead. Previous to the advent of Europeans, the art of the\r\npotter was much more important and its practice more general, than\r\nit afterwards became upon the introduction of metallic vessels. The\r\nmode of preparing and moulding the material is minutely described by\r\nthe early observers, and seems to have been common to all the tribes,\r\nand not to have varied materially from that day to this. The work\r\ndevolved almost exclusively upon the women, who kneaded the clay\r\nand formed the vessels. [p188] Experience seems to have suggested\r\nthe means of so tempering the material as to resist the action of\r\nfire; accordingly we find pounded shells, quartz, and sometimes\r\nsimple coarse sand from the streams, mixed with the clay. None of the\r\npottery of the present races, found in the Ohio valley, is destitute\r\nof this feature; and it is not uncommon, in certain localities, where\r\nfrom the abundance of fragments, and from other circumstances, it is\r\nsupposed the manufacture was specially carried on, to find quantities\r\nof the decayed shells of the fresh-water molluscs intermixed with\r\nthe earth, which were probably brought to the spot to be used in\r\nthe process. Among the Indians along the Gulf, a greater degree\r\nof skill was displayed than with those on the upper waters of the\r\nMississippi and on the lakes. Their vessels were generally larger and\r\nmore symmetrical, and of a superior finish. They moulded them over\r\ngourds and other models, and baked them in ovens. In the construction\r\nof those of large size, it was customary to model them in baskets\r\nof willow or splints, which, at the proper period, were burned off,\r\nleaving the vessel perfect in form, and retaining the somewhat\r\nornamental markings of their moulds. Some of those found on the Ohio\r\nseem to have been modelled in bags or nettings of coarse thread or\r\ntwisted bark. These practices are still retained by some of the\r\nremote western tribes. Of this description of pottery many specimens\r\nare found with the recent deposits in the mounds. They are identical\r\nin every respect with those taken from the known burial-grounds of\r\nthe Indians; and though generally of rude workmanship, they are not\r\ndestitute of a certain symmetry of shape and proportion.\r\n\r\nAmong the mound-builders the art of pottery attained to a\r\nconsiderable degree of perfection. Various though not abundant\r\nspecimens of their skill have been recovered, which, in elegance of\r\nmodel, delicacy, and finish, as also in fineness of material, come\r\nfully up to the best Peruvian specimens, to which they bear, in many\r\nrespects, a close resemblance. They far exceed anything of which the\r\nexisting tribes of Indians are known to have been capable. It is to\r\nbe regretted that none of these remains have been recovered entire in\r\nthe course of our investigations: they have been found only in the\r\naltar or sacrificial mounds, and always in fragments. The largest\r\ndeposit was found in the long mound, No. 3, “Mound City,” (see page\r\n149,) from which were taken fragments enough to have originally\r\ncomposed a dozen vessels of medium size. By the exercise of great\r\ncare and patience in collecting and arranging the pieces, a few\r\nvessels have been very nearly restored,—so nearly, as not only to\r\nshow with all desirable accuracy their shape, but also the character\r\nof their ornaments. They exhibit a variety of graceful forms.\r\n\r\nThe material of which they are composed is a fine clay; which, in\r\nthe more delicate specimens, appears to have been worked nearly\r\npure, possessing a very slight silicious intermixture. Some of the\r\ncoarser specimens, though much superior in model, have something\r\nof the character of the Indian ware already described, pulverized\r\nquartz being intermixed with the clay. Others are tempered with a\r\nsalmon-colored mica in small flakes, which gives them a ruddy and\r\nrather brilliant appearance, and was perhaps introduced with some\r\nview to ornament as well as [p189] utility.[124] None appear\r\nto have been glazed; although one or two, either from baking or\r\nthe subsequent great heat to which they were subjected, exhibit a\r\nslightly vitrified surface. Their excellent finish seems to have been\r\nthe result of the same process with that adopted by the Peruvians in\r\ntheir fictile manufactures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLVI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n PLATE XLVI.\r\n EARTHEN VESSELS FROM THE MOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThis Plate exhibits drawings of eight vessels of pottery; of which\r\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 4, were taken from the mounds of Ohio, and Nos. 6, 7,\r\n8, 9, from the mounds of South Carolina and Florida. Nos. 3 and 4,\r\nalthough taken from the mounds, will readily be recognised as of\r\ncomparatively modern manufacture. They were found with the recent\r\ndeposits, and may be considered as fair specimens of Indian skill\r\nin this department. Unlike the older vessels with which they are\r\nplaced in contrast, they are heavy and coarse, both in material and\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 1 is a beautiful vase, moulded from pure clay, with a slight\r\nsilicious intermixture. Its thickness is uniform throughout, not\r\nexceeding one sixth of an inch. Its outer as well as interior surface\r\nis smooth, except where it is dotted by way of ornament. Its finish\r\nresembles in all respects that of the finer Peruvian pottery, and,\r\nwhen held in certain positions towards the light, exhibits the\r\nsame peculiarities of surface, as if it had been carefully shaved\r\nand smoothed with a sharp knife. It is highly polished, and has an\r\nunctuous feel. The exterior is ornamented as represented in the\r\ndrawing. The lines are carved in, and appear to have been cut by some\r\nsharp «gouge-shaped» instrument, which entirely removed the detached\r\nmaterial, leaving no ragged or raised edges. Nothing can exceed\r\nthe uniformity and precision with which they are executed; and it\r\nseems almost impossible that the artist could have preserved so much\r\nregularity, with no other guide than the eye. There are four groups\r\nor festoons of lines, each of which occupies an equal division of the\r\nsurface. A line is carried around the top of the vase near the edge,\r\nin which, at equal distances from each other, are pierced four small\r\nholes, a fifth of an inch in diameter. Between this line and the edge\r\nis a row of dots, formed with the same instrument used in carving\r\nthe lines, held in an oblique direction to the surface. The spaces\r\nbetween some of the lines are [p190] roughened in a similar manner.\r\nThe color of this vase is a dark brown or umber. Its height is five\r\nand a half, its diameter six and a half inches. The fragment, Fig. 5,\r\nexhibits the thickness of the ware, the size of the engraved lines,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNUMBER 2 is a vase of coarser material but more elaborate outline\r\nthan the one just described. It is square, with slightly rounded\r\nangles, and has a singular offset or shoulder at the top. Its\r\nexterior is divided into four compartments, within each of which\r\nis an ornamental figure, somewhat resembling a bird with extended\r\nwings. This ornament is thrown in relief by the roughening of the\r\nremaining portions of the surface. One or two other vases have been\r\nfound, possessing the same shape and having identical ornaments, but\r\nlacking the offset or shoulder above mentioned. The ornamental work,\r\nin all of these specimens, is executed in a free, bold style; and\r\nthe figures differ just enough to show that they were not cut after\r\na pattern. This vase is burned hard; its thickness is but one eighth\r\nof an inch; its dimensions are, height five inches, greatest diameter\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nFrom the delicacy of these specimens, and the amount of labor\r\nexpended upon them, it is concluded that they were not used for\r\nordinary purposes. They were perhaps designed to contain articles\r\nvalued by the possessor, or to be used only on certain important\r\noccasions. It has been suggested that they were possibly the\r\n«censers» of the ancient priesthood, or, from the fact of their being\r\nfound only in the altar mounds, appropriated to sacred purposes. This\r\nsupposition might be made with equal propriety in respect to the\r\ncoarser varieties also found on the altars, and which, it is evident,\r\nwere designed to be used for purposes requiring strength and the\r\ncapability of withstanding fire.\r\n\r\nNUMBERS 3 and 4 are drawn upon the same scale with the two above\r\ndescribed; they contain between one and two quarts. As before\r\nremarked, they may be regarded as in all respects very good specimens\r\nof the skill of the modern northern tribes in this description of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nIn the mounds of the South, pottery exists in great abundance; but it\r\ndiffers very much in form and quality from the specimens found on the\r\nOhio. It is coarser in material, and seems to have been manufactured\r\nwith less care. The ornaments, although not without grace, are\r\nroughly executed. Some of the vessels seem to have been burned to\r\nconsiderable hardness, and exhibit the consequent redness of color;\r\nbut most are of a dark brown, and appear to have been hardened over\r\nfires, rather than burned in kilns.\r\n\r\nNUMBERS 6, 7, 8, and 9, as already observed, are examples of this\r\nSouthern ware. Number 6 is from South Carolina; Nos. 7, 8, and 9,\r\nfrom Florida: they are all deposited in the cabinet of the Historical\r\nSociety of New York. No. 6 is about twelve inches in height, of\r\nrather elegant model, and ornamented with scrolls. It contains\r\nupwards of a gallon. Nos. 7 and 9 hold about a quart each; No. 8\r\nperhaps three quarts.\r\n\r\nSome of those found in the mounds of Carolina are of great size, and\r\ncapable [p191] of holding from three to thirty gallons. These are\r\nseldom ornamented, but are extremely well formed. It may be remarked\r\nthat the handles of the Southern vases are often neatly moulded into\r\nscrolls, or representations of the heads of animals and birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nFig. 71, Number 1, is a very good specimen of an ancient Peruvian\r\nvessel, now deposited in the museum of the Historical Society of\r\nConnecticut, at Hartford. The peculiar spout, answering the double\r\npurpose of use and ornament, has been observed in some of the vases\r\nof the Southern United States. Number 2 illustrates one variety of\r\nearthen ware, which is common from the mouth of the Ohio to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. This specimen was taken from a mound at Ellis’s Bluff,\r\nnear Natchez. It contained burnt remains, though we are uninformed of\r\nwhat description. It is unbaked and composed of a singular kind of\r\nclay, which exhibits the appearance and has the feel of the softer\r\nvarieties of “soap stone.” The material is accurately described\r\nby Mr. Flint, in his account of certain articles of pottery found\r\nin Missouri. “The composition when fractured shows many white\r\nfloccules in the clay, that resemble fine snow; and these I judge\r\nto be pulverized shells. The basis of the composition seems to be\r\nthe alluvial clay, carried along in the waters of the Mississippi,\r\nand called by the French ‘«terre grasse»,’ from its greasy feel.”\r\nThis specimen is seven inches high by eight inches in its greatest\r\ndiameter. The neck is two and a half inches long, and a cover\r\nfits neatly over it, completely closing the vessel. It is very\r\nsymmetrical, exhibiting but slight irregularities. Its thickness\r\nis not far from three eighths of an inch, but it is evidently not\r\nuniform throughout. It has no markings, except some irregular notches\r\nin the rim of the base.[125]\r\n\r\nMany vessels of similar shape are found in Tennessee, Mississippi,\r\nand Louisiana, of which number 3 of the cut furnishes a very good\r\nexample. They are of a great variety of sizes, and sometimes have the\r\nform of the human head, or of [p192] animals. The celebrated “Triune\r\nvessel,” which has been made the basis of so much unprofitable\r\nspeculation, was of the latter character, and represented three\r\nhuman heads joined at the back. They are variously ornamented,\r\nand sometimes painted with red and brown colors. Their form seems\r\ngenerally to have been suggested by that of the gourd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\nFig. 72, Number 1. This vessel, clearly of modern workmanship, was\r\nfound a few feet below the surface, near the town of Hamilton, Butler\r\ncounty, Ohio. It was placed beside a human skeleton, and contained a\r\nsingle muscle-shell. The material is a compound of clay and pounded\r\nshells; its height is seven inches, diameter five and a half. Number\r\n2 was found in the same vicinity, and under similar circumstances\r\nwith that last described. It is of like composition, thick, and of a\r\ndark black color.\r\n\r\nNumber 3 was found in Perry county, Indiana, at a locality known as\r\nthe “Big Bone Bank.” It is composed of finer material than those\r\njust described. The aperture at the mouth is two inches in diameter;\r\nthe vase itself is five inches in height, and measures thirteen in\r\ncircumference. The “Big Bone Bank,” to which we have alluded, occurs\r\non the Wabash river, ten miles above its mouth, and is supposed by\r\nmany to have been a cemetery of the mound-builders. Human remains are\r\nvery abundant here, and are said to occur as deep as ten feet below\r\nthe surface. With these are deposited various relics, consisting for\r\nthe most part of vessels of pottery, which are exposed from time\r\nto time by the wasting away of the bank. The following specimens,\r\nobtained from this locality, together with those just described, are\r\nin the cabinet of JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq., Hamilton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\nFig. 73 measures three inches in height by seventeen in\r\ncircumference. It is [p193] of fine clay, burned, and in model\r\nsomewhat resembles the ancient pipkin. Before it was fractured, it\r\nprobably terminated in a representation of the head of some animal.\r\n\r\nFig. 74 is of precisely the same material with that last described.\r\nBesides the two handles, it has four strong knobs at right angles to\r\neach other, by which it was probably designed the vessel might be\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nAll the vessels from this locality are composed of clay, compounded\r\nas already described, and baked; they are of small size, the largest\r\ncontaining but little more than one quart. They fall far short of\r\nthose from the mounds in fineness and elegance of finish, though\r\nsuperior to the general manufacture of the Indians. They resemble\r\nmore closely the coarse but very well moulded pottery of Florida and\r\nthe South-west.\r\n\r\nA few «terra cottas» have been found in the mounds; they are said to\r\nbe abundant at the South, where they are represented to possess a\r\ngreat variety of forms. In material they are identical with the finer\r\nspecimens of pottery already described, and like them seem generally\r\nto have been baked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75 Half size.]\r\n\r\nFig. 75. This unique relic was ploughed up, on the banks of the Yazoo\r\nriver, in the State of Mississippi. It is composed of clay, smoothly\r\nmoulded and burned, and represents some animal, «couchant», lips\r\ncorrugated and exhibiting its teeth as if in anger or defiance. It\r\nseems to have been used as a pipe. The attitude is alike natural and\r\nspirited.[126] [p194]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76 Half size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Half size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Half size.]\r\n\r\nFigures 76 and 77 are both pipes of baked clay. They were ploughed\r\nup in Virginia at a point nearly opposite the mouth of the Hocking\r\nriver, where there are abundant traces of an ancient people, in the\r\nform of mounds, embankments, etc. One represents a human head, with\r\na singular head-dress, closely resembling some of those observed on\r\nthe idols and sculptures of Mexico. The other represents some animal\r\ncoiled together, and is executed with a good deal of spirit.\r\n\r\nFig. 78 is a reduced outline representation of an article of baked\r\nclay, found a number of years ago, in a mound near Nashville,\r\nTennessee. It has the form of a human head, with a portentous nose\r\nand unprecedented phrenological developments. It is smooth and well\r\npolished, and contains six small balls of clay, which were discovered\r\nupon perforating the neck. They must necessarily have been introduced\r\nbefore the burning of the toy. Similar conceits were common in Mexico\r\nand Peru, and were observed by Kotzebue upon the North-west Coast.\r\nThe Mexicans had also rude flutes of clay, upon which, with a little\r\npractice, not unmusical sounds may be produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nFig. 79 was taken from a mound in Butler county, Ohio. It represents\r\nthe head of a bird, somewhat resembling the toucan, and is executed\r\nwith much spirit. It seems originally to have been attached to some\r\nvessel, from which it was broken before being deposited in the\r\nmound.[127] [p195]\r\n\r\nFig. 80 presents greatly reduced sketches of a couple of clay pipes.\r\nThe one indicated by the figure 1 was found in a mound in Florida,\r\nand is now in the museum of the Historical Society of New York; the\r\nother is from a mound in South Carolina, and is in the cabinet of Dr.\r\nS. G. Morton, of Philadelphia. Most of the ancient clay pipes that\r\nhave been discovered have this form, which is not widely different\r\nfrom that adopted by the later Indians.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the regularity of figure and uniformity of thickness\r\nwhich many of the specimens of aboriginal pottery exhibit, it is\r\nclear that they were all moulded by hand. There is no evidence that\r\nthe potter’s wheel was known, nor that the art of glazing, as now\r\npractised, was understood. It is not impossible, but on the contrary\r\nappears extremely probable, from a close inspection of the mound\r\npottery, that the ancient people possessed the simple approximation\r\ntowards the potter’s wheel, consisting of a stick of wood grasped in\r\nthe hand by the middle and turned round inside a wall of clay, formed\r\nby the other hand or by another workman. The polish, which some of\r\nthe finer vessels possess, is due to other causes, and is not the\r\nresult of vitrification. That a portion of the ancient pottery was\r\nnot baked is very certain; but that another portion, including all\r\nvessels which were designed for common use, for cooking and similar\r\npurposes, was burned, is equally certain. In some of the Southern\r\nStates, it is said, the kilns, in which the ancient pottery was\r\nbaked, are now occasionally to be met with. Some are represented\r\nstill to contain the ware, partially burned, and retaining the rinds\r\nof the gourds, etc., over which they were modelled, and which had\r\nnot been entirely removed by the fire. “In Panola county,” says Mr.\r\nR. Morris, in a private letter, “are found great numbers of what are\r\ntermed ‘«pottery kilns»;’ in which are masses of vitrified matter,\r\nfrequently in the form of rude bricks, measuring twelve inches in\r\nlength by ten in breadth.” It seems most likely that these “kilns”\r\nare the remains of the manufactories of the later tribes, the\r\nChoctaws and Natchez, who, says Adair, “made a prodigious number of\r\nvessels of pottery, of such variety of forms as would be tedious to\r\ndescribe, and impossible to name.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[124] “The present Chilenoes are good potters for common ware; they\r\nintroduce a considerable quantity of earth and sand, containing\r\nabundance of yellow mica, and their vessels sometimes contain as much\r\nas seventy gallons or more. They are of great thinness, lightness,\r\nand strength.”—«Schmidtmeyer’s Chile», p. 117.\r\n\r\n[125] In the cabinet of Dr. S. P. HILDRETH, Marietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[126] In the cabinet of JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq.\r\n\r\n[127] In the cabinet of JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p196]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI.\r\n IMPLEMENTS OF METAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first inquiry suggested by an inspection of the mounds and other\r\nearthworks of the West, relates to the means at the command of the\r\nbuilders in constructing them. However numerous we may suppose the\r\nancient people to have been, we must regard these works as entirely\r\nbeyond their capabilities, unless they had some artificial aids.\r\nAs an agricultural people, they must have possessed some means of\r\nclearing the land of forests and of tilling the soil. We can hardly\r\nconceive, at this day, how these operations could be performed\r\nwithout the aid of iron; yet we know that the Peruvians and Mexicans,\r\nwhose monuments emulate the proudest of the old world, were wholly\r\nunacquainted with the uses of that metal, and constructed their\r\nedifices and carried on their agricultural operations with implements\r\nof wood, stone, and copper. They possessed the secret of hardening\r\nthe metal last named, so as to make it subserve most of the uses to\r\nwhich iron is applied. Of it they made axes, chisels, and knives.\r\n\r\nThe mound-builders were acquainted with several of the metals,\r\nalthough they do not seem to have possessed the art of reducing\r\nthem from the ores. Implements and ornaments of copper are found in\r\nconsiderable abundance among their remains; silver is occasionally\r\nfound in the form of ornaments, but only to a trifling amount; the\r\nore of lead, galena, has been discovered in considerable quantities,\r\nbut none of the metal has been found under such circumstances as\r\nto establish conclusively that they were acquainted with the art\r\nof smelting it. No iron or traces of iron, except with the recent\r\ndeposits, have been discovered; nor is it believed that the race of\r\nthe mounds had any knowledge of that metal. The copper and silver\r\nfound in the mounds were doubtless obtained in their native state,\r\nand afterwards worked without the intervention of fire. The locality\r\nfrom which they were derived seems pretty clearly indicated by the\r\npeculiar mechanico-chemical combination existing, in some specimens,\r\nbetween the silver and copper, which combination characterizes only\r\nthe native masses of Lake Superior. In none of the articles found is\r\nthere evidence of welding, nor do any of them appear to have been\r\ncast in moulds. On the contrary, they seem to have been hammered out\r\nof rude masses, and gradually and with great labor brought into the\r\nrequired shape. The lamination, resulting from hammering the baser\r\nmetals while cold, is to be observed in nearly all the articles.\r\nBut, notwithstanding the disadvantages which they labored under, the\r\nmound-builders contrived to produce some very creditable specimens of\r\nworkmanship, displaying both taste and skill.\r\n\r\nNo articles composed entirely of silver have been discovered: the\r\nextreme scarcity of that metal seems to have led to the utmost\r\neconomy in its use. It is [p197] only found reduced to great\r\nthinness, and plated upon copper. By «plated», it should not be\r\nunderstood that any chemical combination, or a union produced by\r\nheat, exists between the two metals, but simply that thin slips\r\nof silver were «wrapped» closely around the copper, their edges\r\noverlapping, so as to leave no portion exposed. This was done so\r\nneatly as, in many cases, almost to escape detection.\r\n\r\nAXES.—Among the implements recovered from the mounds, are several\r\ncopper axes, the general form of which is well exhibited in the\r\nengravings herewith presented. They are well wrought, and each\r\nappears to have been made from a single piece,—showing that the metal\r\nwas obtained in considerable masses. The largest of these, Fig. 81,\r\nweighs two pounds five ounces. It measures seven inches in length, by\r\nfour in breadth at the cutting edge, and has an average thickness of\r\nabout four tenths of an inch. Its edge is slightly curved, somewhat\r\nafter the manner of the axes of the present day, and is «bevelled»\r\nfrom both surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nFig. 82 is less in size, but of heavier proportions. It weighs two\r\npounds, and [p198] measures six and one third inches in length, by\r\nthree and one third in width on the edge. Unlike the other, it has\r\na nearly straight cutting surface; the blade, however, is curved\r\nor «gouge-shaped», closely resembling the adze at present used in\r\nhollowing timbers, and it was probably applied to a similar purpose\r\nwith that instrument. Its head is slightly battered, as if it had\r\nsustained blows from a hammer, or had itself been used in pounding.\r\n\r\nIt may seem incomprehensible to many persons, how these axes, being\r\ndestitute of an eye for the insertion of a handle, and not even\r\npossessing the groove of the Indian stone axe, for the reception of\r\na withe, could have been used with any effect. They were doubtless\r\nfitted in the same manner with those of the ancient Mexicans and\r\nPeruvians, with which, from all accounts, they seem to be identical\r\nin form.\r\n\r\n“The Mexicans,” observes Clavigero, “made use of an axe to cut trees,\r\nwhich was also made of copper, and was of the same form with those\r\nof modern times, except that we put the handle in an eye of the axe,\r\nwhile they put the axe in an eye of the handle.”[128]\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Islanders have a sort of adze, which is formed by firmly\r\nlashing a blade of stone, with its cutting edge at right angles, to a\r\nhandle, having a sharp crook at its extremity. This mode of fastening\r\nwould enable the axe with the curved blade to be used with the\r\ngreatest efficiency as an adze. That it was designed to be so used,\r\nseems apparent from the fact that the edge is not formed by bevelling\r\nfrom both sides, but from the inner surface only, precisely in the\r\nmanner that the adze of the present day is ground. Fig. 83 exhibits\r\nthe probable manner in which these instruments were fitted for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which these interesting relics were\r\ndiscovered, are detailed in the chapter on the Mounds. (See page\r\n154.) It will be seen they were not found where, as a general and\r\nalmost invariable rule, we must look for the only authentic remains\r\nof the mound-builders, viz. at the bottom of the mound. They are\r\nnevertheless classed as undoubted relics of the ancient race. The\r\nimplements of the modern Indians are found, whenever they occur in\r\nthe mounds, in [p199] connection with human remains, in the position\r\nin which they were deposited with the dead. We have no evidence that\r\nthe northern tribes of Indians possessed copper articles of this\r\ndescription, and but slender evidence at best that they were in\r\nuse among the Indians along the Gulf.[129] A positive argument in\r\nfavor of the origin imputed to them, is presented in the fact that\r\nmany of the articles found both in the sepulchral and sacrificial\r\nmounds are of copper, and of similar workmanship, denoting that the\r\nmound-builders possessed the metal in considerable abundance, and\r\nwere very well acquainted with its capabilities. That they have an\r\nantiquity higher than the date of the first European intercourse,\r\nis established by their form; but if this were insufficient, the\r\nevidence may be found in the fact that from immediately over them was\r\nremoved the stump of a tree, originally of the largest size, which\r\nhad long since fallen and decayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.]\r\n\r\nThis implement (Fig. 84) was found in a mound near one of the great\r\nworks on Paint creek. It resembles a double-bladed hatchet, and was\r\nperhaps used as such. It measures six inches in length, and is three\r\ninches broad at each end; across the middle it measures but two and a\r\nhalf inches. It weighs about one pound and a half. The hole through\r\nthe centre may have been designed for the insertion of a rivet, so\r\nas to fasten it firmly in a handle, as represented in the reduced\r\nsketch, number 2. [p200]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.]\r\n\r\nCopper axes similar in all respects to those here described have been\r\nfound at various places in Ohio. One of them, now in the possession\r\nof a gentleman of Hillsboro’, is of the same shape with Fig. 82; it\r\nweighs two pounds. It was found near the great hill-work in Highland\r\ncounty (Plate V). Another, corresponding with the above, is in the\r\npossession of R. Buchanan, Esq., of Cincinnati. It was found, in\r\nconnection with six others, a few miles north of Yellow Springs,\r\nin the valley of the Little Miami river. They were discovered in\r\nexcavating a cellar, three or four feet beneath the surface. Large\r\ntrees had been growing on the spot. Another axe, of different shape,\r\nwas found not many years since, in a mound near Deerfield, on the\r\nLittle Miami. It was worked up by the village blacksmith. Still\r\nanother, of comparatively rude workmanship, is deposited in the\r\nCincinnati Museum. The circumstances under which it was discovered\r\nare unknown.\r\n\r\nDRILLS OR GRAVERS.—Among the remains on the sacrificial altars, have\r\nbeen found graving tools or rude chisels of copper. These were formed\r\nby hammering the copper into rods, with sharp tapering points or\r\nwith chisel-shaped edges. Full size sketches of several of these are\r\npresented, Fig. 85. Nos. 1 and 2 were found in the long mound, No. 3\r\n“Mound City,” in connection with numerous other remains.\r\n\r\nAn implement of copper, identical in shape with No. 1, although\r\nsomewhat larger in size, is deposited in the Philadelphia Museum. It\r\nwas taken from a mound in Alabama.\r\n\r\nNos. 3, 4, and 5, were discovered in making excavations in the works\r\nat Marietta. The character of each of these is sufficiently well\r\nexplained by the engravings. No. 1 measures eight inches in length,\r\nand weighs about two ounces. No. 2 is less in size, and seems to have\r\nbeen used as a graver. It cuts the softer varieties of stone with\r\nfacility. Whether those found at Marietta were designed for similar\r\npurposes, or were intended to be bent together for ornaments, it is\r\nnot undertaken to say. That some instruments, of similar character\r\nwith these, were used by the mound-builders, in their carvings in\r\nstone, will be apparent when we come to speak of their sculptures.\r\n[p201]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\nFig. 86. No. 1 is a greatly reduced sketch of a copper spear or\r\nlance-head, found three miles north-west of Cincinnati, Ohio. It was\r\ndiscovered about two feet below the surface, at the base of a small\r\nhill, which was crowned by an Indian grave. The original is eight\r\ninches in length.[130]\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is a reduced sketch of a rude copper knife found in the summer\r\nof 1847, on Isle Royal, Lake Superior. It was discovered three feet\r\nbelow the surface, by the uprooting of a tree, which had grown above\r\nit. It has the lamination of surface already referred to, in a marked\r\ndegree, and was evidently hammered from a single piece of native\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\nThe copper articles above represented (Fig. 87) were all found, in\r\nconnection with other relics and some human skeletons, in excavating\r\nthe St. Lawrence canal, Canada West. The drawings, from which the\r\nengravings are reduced, were kindly furnished, together with a full\r\ndescription, by T. REYNOLDS, M.D., of Brockville, in whose possession\r\nthe originals now are. “The spot where they were discovered, is a\r\npicturesque point on the banks of the river St. Lawrence, near the\r\nhead of the first rapid or cascade met with in descending the river.\r\nThey were found deposited fourteen feet below the surface, in a soil\r\ncomposed of blue clay and sand. A score of skeletons were found\r\n[p202] arranged around them, their feet pointing to the spot where\r\nthey were placed. The bones crumbled upon exposure to the air. A few\r\nyards from this place, and at about the same depth from the surface,\r\nanother circular space was exposed to view; but strange to say, here\r\nthe organic remains had been subjected to the action of fire, and the\r\nhalf-burned bones with the charcoal and ashes, evinced the fact that\r\nnatural decomposition had been anticipated by the hand of man.\r\n\r\n“Numbers 1 and 2 were evidently designed for spears, and intended\r\nto fit into handles. The blades are of considerable thickness, not\r\nmuch corroded, but of rude proportions. They are pointed, and have a\r\ndouble cutting edge, and were undoubtedly weapons of some service.\r\nNo. 1 is a foot in length. No. 3 is a copper knife, engraved of half\r\nsize. One edge is sharp, and has marks of considerable use. The point\r\nis broken off. No. 5 is also a knife, less in size, and has a hooked\r\nextremity, as shown in the engraving. It was probably designed to be\r\nused without a handle. No. 4 is an implement ten inches in length.\r\nIt has a hollow or socket for the reception of a handle, with a\r\ncorresponding convexity on the back. The chisel-shaped extremity is\r\nblunt, but capable of receiving a sharp edge. It may have been used\r\nas a chisel, or gouge,—perhaps as a sort of spade.\r\n\r\n“With respect to the question whether these remains are of European\r\norigin or manufacture, I have merely to remark that their workmanship\r\nis very rude; that no traces of iron or of European implements were\r\nfound with them, and that the copper corresponds exactly with the\r\nspecimens of native metal obtained from Lake Superior. The nature of\r\nthe soil at this spot is favorable for the preservation of organic\r\nremains; the fact, therefore, that the bones found with these relics\r\nwere in so advanced a stage of decomposition, induces me to believe\r\nthat they were deposited long before the discovery and occupation\r\nof Canada by Europeans. We might expect here to find relics bearing\r\nthe stamp of French manufacture; but there is nothing in the form\r\nor composition of these which would lead one to suppose them to be\r\nof French origin. This spot was not the usual burying-place of the\r\nIndians. Their cemetery seems to have been some distance back from\r\nthe river, upon a high sandy ridge, where their remains, apparently\r\nof very ancient deposit, are now found in abundance.”\r\n\r\nFrom what has been presented, it appears that the mound-builders were\r\nvery well acquainted with the use of copper. They do not, however,\r\nseem to have possessed the secret of giving it any extraordinary\r\ndegree of hardness. The axes above described were found, upon\r\nanalysis, to be «pure copper», unalloyed, to any perceptible extent,\r\nby other metals. The hardness which they seem to possess, beyond the\r\ncopper of commerce, is no doubt due to the hammering to which they\r\nwere subjected in their manufacture. As already observed, the metal\r\nappears to have been worked, in all cases, in a cold state. This is\r\nsomewhat remarkable, as the fires upon the altars were sufficiently\r\nstrong, in some instances, to melt down the copper implements and\r\nornaments deposited upon them, and the fact that the metal is fusible\r\ncould hardly have escaped notice.\r\n\r\nIt has already been suggested, upon the strength of the fact that\r\nsome of the specimens of copper obtained from the mounds have\r\ncrystals of silver attached to them, that a part of the supply of\r\nthe ancient people was obtained from the [p203] shores of Lake\r\nSuperior, where alone this peculiar combination is known to exist.\r\nThe circumstance that the mound axes are made of unalloyed copper,\r\ndoes not affect this conclusion; for a large proportion of the native\r\nmetal found at this locality is pure. The conclusion is further\r\nsustained by the amount of the metal extracted from the mounds,\r\nimplying a large original supply. Besides numerous small pieces, some\r\nlarge fragments are occasionally discovered. One of these, weighing\r\ntwenty-three pounds, and from which portions had evidently been cut,\r\nwas found a few years since near Chillicothe. Still, it does not\r\nappear that copper was sufficiently abundant to entirely supersede\r\nthe use of bone and stone implements.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128] “The copper axes of the Peruvians differ very little in shape\r\nfrom ours, and it appears that these were the implements with which\r\nthey performed most of their works. They are of various shapes and\r\nsizes, the edge of some is more circular than others, and some have a\r\nconcave edge.”—«Ulloa», vol. i. p. 483.\r\n\r\n[129] It is asserted by the Portuguese chronicler of De Soto’s\r\nill-fated expedition, that copper hatchets were found in possession\r\nof some of the Indian tribes along the Gulf, “which were said to have\r\na mixture of gold.” These, the Spaniards were told, were obtained\r\nin a province towards the north, called «Chisca», “where there was\r\na melting of copper, and of another metal of the same color, save\r\nthat it was finer and far better to the sight, which they used not\r\nso much, because it was softer.” The Spaniards did not visit the\r\nprovince of Chisca; as they were informed high mountains intervened,\r\nwhich could not be passed with horses. This, it is believed, is the\r\nonly account of anything of the kind occurring north of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[130] In the cabinet of R. BUCHANAN, Esq., Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p204]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII.\r\n ORNAMENTS OF METAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that it was often used for implements, copper seems\r\nto have been most highly valued by the mound-builders for purposes\r\nof ornament. The supposition is based upon the fact that ornaments\r\nof this metal are comparatively abundant. They are found of many\r\nvarieties, comprising bracelets, pendants, beads, gorgets, etc., some\r\nof which display no inconsiderable degree of skill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\nThe «bracelets» are usually found encircling the arms of the\r\nskeletons, in the sepulchral mounds, but are not infrequent upon\r\nthe altars. They consist of a simple rod of copper, hammered out\r\nwith more or less skill, and so bent that the ends approach, or lap\r\nover, each other. Those which have been deposited under unfavorable\r\ncircumstances are generally much corroded and appear ragged and rude.\r\nBut some are found which are extremely well wrought. Such was the\r\ncase with those obtained from a mound, within an enclosure, three\r\nmiles above Chillicothe, (see page 156,) three of which of full\r\nsize are shown in the engraving. These are smoothly and uniformly\r\nhammered, and seem to have been originally highly polished. They\r\nare bent with perfect regularity; and, it is a singular fact, are\r\nof uniform size and weight. They measure, between [p205] the outer\r\nsurfaces, two inches and nine tenths,—between the inner surfaces,\r\ntwo and a half inches in diameter; and weigh four ounces each. They\r\ncorrespond exactly with some of the ruder ones, of the same metal,\r\nfound in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians. They were but partially\r\nbent together before being placed upon the arm, after which they were\r\nclosed as nearly as practicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\nThe ornaments denominated, for want of a better name, «gorgets», are\r\nfrequently found, but only, so far as observed, with skeletons, in\r\nthe sepulchral mounds. An engraving of one of these is presented,\r\n(Fig. 89,) which exhibits their general form. The original, in this\r\ninstance, measures eight and a half inches at the lower, and seven\r\nand a half at the upper edge, and is four and a quarter inches\r\nbroad. It weighs five ounces. This is considerably above the average\r\ndimensions. They are usually about the thickness of ordinary sheet\r\ncopper; and are always perforated with two holes, placed at equal\r\ndistances from the ends and somewhat above the longitudinal centre,\r\nas shown in the engraving. This feature, and the fact that they are\r\nuniformly found with skeletons, suggest that they were suspended\r\naround the neck, resting upon the breast. There is one circumstance,\r\nhowever, that seems inconsistent with this conclusion, namely, that\r\nnone of the holes exhibit the slightest elongation from wear. On the\r\ncontrary, their edges are sharp as if newly cut. Such could not have\r\nbeen the case with articles of this soft material and extraordinary\r\nthinness, had they been suspended in the manner suggested. The holes\r\nin the little silver crosses, found in the graves of the modern\r\nIndians, are frequently worn so as to be nearly a fourth of an inch\r\nin length; and yet they weigh less than half an ounce, and are cut\r\nout of thicker plates of metal than the broad copper ornaments here\r\nmentioned. Either these plates were worn only on extraordinary\r\noccasions, or in such a manner that little or no friction was\r\nproduced by the cords by which they were sustained or fastened.[131]\r\n[p206]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\nFig. 90 represents an ornament, of something the same character with\r\nthe above. It is formed of a copper plate of considerable thickness,\r\nwhich has been fashioned so as to present a convex surface. It is\r\nalso perforated with two holes, and is identical in this respect, as\r\nwell as in shape, with a large class of stone ornaments or implements\r\nfound in the mounds, and of which notice will be taken in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\nA large number of «discs» or medals of copper have been obtained\r\nfrom the mounds. They resemble, to use a familiar illustration, the\r\n«bosses» observed on harnesses. Some of these are not less than\r\ntwo inches, but most are about one inch and a half in diameter.\r\nThey are formed of thin plates of copper, are perfectly round, and\r\nconcavo-convex in shape. They are found only on the altar-mounds,\r\nwhere they seem to have been placed with their edges together, in\r\npairs. Owing to the great heat to which they have been subjected,\r\nand subsequent oxydation, nearly all of them are so cemented\r\ntogether that they cannot be separated without breaking them into\r\nfragments. Their present appearance is very well exhibited by Fig.\r\n91. Some of them, of more elaborate workmanship than the rest, and\r\nwhich have been more favorably situated for preservation, have been\r\nseparated.[132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\nThese articles, it will be observed, display more skill in working\r\nthe metal, than any of those previously noticed. They present every\r\nappearance of having been «pressed» into shape, in the way in which\r\nsimilar articles are formed at this day. In opening one of the\r\nmounds, a block of compact sandstone was discovered, [p207] Fig.\r\n92, in which were several circular depressions, in all respects\r\nresembling those in the work-blocks of copper-smiths, in which plates\r\nof metal are hammered to give them convexity. These depressions are\r\nof various dimensions, and are evidently artificial. It seems more\r\nthan probable it was in such moulds that these articles were formed.\r\nThis block weighs between thirty and forty pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\nSmall tubes of copper, formed by wrapping together thin slips of that\r\nmetal, are often found. They are not soldered, and though the edges\r\noverlap each other very closely, they can easily be separated with\r\nthe blade of a knife. They were doubtless strung as beads. Another\r\nvariety of beads, made of coarse copper wire, closely wound and\r\nhammered together, are occasionally found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\nAmong the articles that exhibit the greatest degree of skill in\r\ntheir manufacture, may be mentioned a sort of «boss» or «button»,\r\nseveral of which are shown in the engraving. These present a convex\r\nand a plane surface, and are identical in form with some of the\r\nold-fashioned buttons which still linger on the small clothes of our\r\ngrandfathers. They are hollow; a portion of them are perforated from\r\nthe sides, but most have the holes through which passed the thread,\r\nby which they were strung or attached, in the base. They bear a\r\nresemblance to some forms of the ancient «fibulæ».\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, many small tubes, bands, and articles of\r\nwrought copper of various kinds have been found, the purposes of\r\nwhich are not apparent, and which it would be tedious to describe.\r\nGreatly reduced sketches of several of these are herewith presented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe metal was sometimes very ingeniously used in repairing broken\r\narticles of stone, etc., as will shortly be seen. One or two stone\r\npipes have been discovered which seem to have been completely\r\nencased, so as to present an unbroken metallic surface. The\r\noverlapping edges, in these cases, were so polished down as scarcely\r\nto be discoverable.\r\n\r\nSilver, as has already been remarked, seems to have been possessed\r\nin very small quantities by the mound-builders. Indeed, within the\r\nentire range of these investigations, it has been discovered in but\r\na single instance,—namely, in the remarkable “pipe mound,” numbered\r\n8 in the plan of “Mound City.” It was here found, reduced to extreme\r\nthinness, (not exceeding in thickness ordinary foolscap paper,) and\r\nplated, or rather wrapped, over sundry copper beads and a few other\r\nornaments of the same material. The whole amount discovered would\r\nprobably not exceed an ounce in weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.]\r\n\r\nFrom the mound above mentioned were taken a number of large beads,\r\nthe size and shape of which are accurately shown in the accompanying\r\nengraving. They are composed of shell, now completely calcined,\r\nand seem to have been carefully enveloped with sheet copper and\r\nafterwards with thin slips of [p208] silver, so as to completely\r\ncover the surface. Some of the beads exhibit both the copper and\r\nsilver partially melted off. The heat of the fire, upon the altar\r\nwhere they were found, had been sufficiently intense, towards the\r\ncentre, to melt considerable masses of copper.\r\n\r\nBesides these beads, several star-shaped ornaments were found.\r\nThey are also composed of shell, bound together by an envelope of\r\nsheet copper, over which the silver slips are carefully folded, so\r\nas to leave their overlapping edges scarcely perceptible. A small\r\nhole passed through the centre of these unique ornaments, by which\r\nthey were fastened in such positions as the taste of the possessor\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.]\r\n\r\nSilver crosses, it has several times been observed, have been\r\ndiscovered with the recent deposits in the mounds. The accompanying\r\nengraving illustrates their general form. Some are considerably\r\nlarger and heavier than that here represented; one found near\r\nChillicothe weighed not less than one and a half ounces. They will\r\nreadily be recognised as of European origin. The enterprising\r\nFrench passed frequently through the Mississippi valley, from a\r\nvery early day, and maintained a constant intercourse with the\r\nnatives, distributing amongst them vast numbers of these crosses,\r\nbrooches, and other ornaments of silver; which, in accordance with\r\nthe aboriginal custom, were buried with the possessor at his death.\r\nNumbers of these relics have been found in the mounds and Indian\r\ngraves of the South. They are perhaps oftener composed of brass than\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\nThe instance first mentioned, it is believed, is the only one in\r\nwhich silver has been found in the mounds under such circumstances\r\nas to establish conclusively that it pertained to the builders. It\r\nis clear that, so far as the specimens here obtained are concerned,\r\nthey did not understand the art of «plating», in the proper meaning\r\nof the term. They had taken but the first step towards it. That art\r\nis certainly one which follows, instead of preceding, the knowledge\r\nof welding and of working metals through the assistance of fire,\r\nwhich knowledge does not seem to have been possessed by them. Their\r\nacquaintance with metallurgy appears to have been confined to working\r\nthe native metals in a cold state; in which, it must be admitted,\r\nthey evinced considerable skill. Further than this, little can be\r\nclaimed for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.]\r\n\r\nFrom the presence of «galena» in the mounds, it seems almost\r\nimpossible that the builders could have been ignorant of the\r\nmanufacture of lead. None of that metal has, however, been discovered\r\nunder such circumstances as to place it beyond doubt that they were\r\nacquainted with it. A rude article, of pure lead, of the following\r\nform, and weighing about half a pound, was discovered, not long\r\nsince, in sinking a well within the trench of the ancient works at\r\nCircleville. It was found about two feet [p209] below the surface,\r\nand was thickly encrusted with a carbonate. We shall not undertake\r\nto ascribe a date to it. Upon one of the altars within a mound in\r\n“Mound City,” (see page 149,) a quantity of galena was found. It had\r\nbeen exposed, in common with all articles found on the altars, to\r\nthe action of fire, which had not, however, been sufficiently strong\r\nto reduce it, though some pieces seem to have been partially fused.\r\nPerhaps it may have been prized only for its brilliancy, and finally\r\ndeposited, with other articles of use or ornament, as an offering.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] RIBAULDE, who visited the shores of Florida in 1562, speaks of\r\na chief who “had hanging about his neck a round plate of red copper\r\nwell polished, with one other lesser one of silver, in the midst of\r\nit, and at his ear a little plate of copper wherewith they use to\r\nstripe the swete from theyer bodyes.” Sir WALTER RALEIGH mentions,\r\nthat the tribes, with which he held communication on the shores\r\nof North Carolina, wore copper plates on their heads, which were\r\nbadges of authority and indicated the chiefs. These plates were so\r\nhighly polished that they were, at first, mistaken for gold. It is\r\nnot impossible that those found in the mounds were worn in a like\r\nmanner by the ancient people. The one described in the text was found\r\nbeneath the head of the skeleton with which it was buried.\r\n\r\n[132] Dr. DRAKE, in his “«View of Cincinnati»,” describes several\r\nornaments or instruments found in a mound at Cincinnati, which are\r\nsomewhat analogous to those described in the text, if not identical\r\nwith them. “Several copper articles were discovered, each consisting\r\nof two sets of circular, concavo-convex plates; the interior one of\r\neach set connected with the other by a hollow axis, around which had\r\nbeen wound some lint.” Articles, answering to this description, were\r\nfound, a few years since, in removing a mound on Paint creek, ten\r\nmiles distant from Chillicothe. In this case, we are assured by the\r\nindividual who discovered them, that the axis was wound round with a\r\nwell-twisted and compact thread, resembling fine linen pack-thread,\r\nwhich was stained green by the salts of the copper, to which its\r\npreservation is entirely attributable. It is possible that some of\r\nthe larger discs, above described, were originally thus connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p210]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII.\r\n IMPLEMENTS OF STONE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a knowledge of the metals, the ingenuity of man\r\ncontrives to fashion from the different varieties of stone, from\r\nthe tusks and bones of animals, and the harder kinds of wood, such\r\nrude implements as his necessities demand, and such ornaments as his\r\nfancy suggests. And even among nations who have a limited knowledge\r\nof the metals, we find these characteristic implements of a ruder\r\nstate still adhered to. In Mexico and Peru, where the use of most\r\nof the metals, except iron, was well understood, the stone axe and\r\nflint-tipped arrow and lance were in common use, at the period of\r\nthe discovery. The early explorers found all the American nations,\r\nfrom the squalid Esquimaux, who struck the morse with a lance pointed\r\nwith its own tusks, to the haughty Aztec, rivalling in his barbaric\r\nsplendor the magnificence of the East, in possession of them. We\r\nare not surprised, therefore, at their occurrence in the mounds. We\r\nfind them with the original and with the recent deposits, and the\r\nplough turns them up to light on every hand. And so striking is the\r\nresemblance between them all, that we are almost ready to conclude\r\nthey were the productions of the same people. This conclusion would\r\nbe irresistible, did we not know that the wants of man have ever been\r\nthe same, and have always suggested like forms to his implements,\r\nand similar modes of using them. The polished instrument with which\r\nthe pioneer of civilization prostrates the forest, has its type in\r\nthe stone axe of the Indian which his plough the next day exposes\r\nto his curious gaze. In the barrows of Denmark and Siberia, in the\r\ntumuli on the plains of Marathon, and even under the shadow of the\r\npyramids themselves, the explorer finds relics, almost identical with\r\nthose disclosed from the mounds, and closely resembling each other in\r\nmaterial, form, and workmanship. We have consequently little whereby\r\nto distinguish the remains of the mound-builders, so far as their\r\nmere implements of stone are concerned, except the position in which\r\nthey are found, and the not entirely imaginary superiority of their\r\nworkmanship, from those of the succeeding races. We have, however,\r\nin the different varieties of stone of which they are composed, the\r\nevidences of a more extended intercourse than we are justified in\r\nascribing to the more recent tribes.\r\n\r\nThe articles composed of stone and bone have a great variety of\r\nforms, which were probably suggested by the purposes for which they\r\nwere designed. They will be classified, so far as their purposes seem\r\napparent. [p211]\r\n\r\nSPEAR OR LANCE HEADS.—Great numbers of flint points are found which,\r\nit is clear from their size and form, could not have been used for\r\ntipping arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99 Half size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\nFig. 99 presents several of these, greatly reduced from the original\r\nsize. Nos. 1 and 2 were designed to be lashed to shafts, previously\r\ndrilled or split to receive them. There are others, however, the\r\nmanner of using which is not so obvious. No. 3 is an example. It\r\nmeasures eleven inches in length by two and a half in its greatest\r\nbreadth. It has been suggested that it was fastened at right angles\r\nto a handle and used as a sort of battle-axe. In one of the mounds\r\nalready several times referred to (page 149) were found, amongst\r\nlarge quantities of fragments, several perfect specimens of rather\r\nremarkable character; one of which, beautifully worked from milky\r\nquartz, is herewith presented of half size (Fig. 100). The difficulty\r\nof accounting for the manner in which they were used is scarcely less\r\nthan in the instance last mentioned. It has been suggested that they\r\nwere perhaps designed to be used in the construction of swords, or\r\noffensive weapons, on the plan of those made by the ancient Mexicans.\r\nThese were formed by slitting a cane or other slender piece of tough\r\nwood, and inserting blades of stone, usually slips of obsidian, upon\r\neither side. These were retained in their place by firmly lashing\r\nthe separated wood together, and filling the cavities with some hard\r\nvariety of gum.[133] The implement was wielded with both hands, and,\r\nwith its sharp serrated edges, constituted a very formidable [p212]\r\nweapon. This notion is favored by the order in which some of the\r\nspecimens, near the edges and least disturbed portions of the altar,\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nSome spear-points of «obsidian» have been found, which, judging from\r\nthe fragments, must have been of large dimensions. The ready fracture\r\nof this mineral, upon exposure to strong heat, has been exceedingly\r\nunfavorable to the recovery entire of any articles composed of it.\r\nThis is the more to be regretted, from the fact that it is believed\r\nto be found «in place» only in Mexico and the volcanic regions of the\r\nSouth-west, and a comparison of the articles found here with those of\r\nthe same material obtained from that direction, might serve to throw\r\nsome degree of light upon the origin and connections of the race of\r\nthe mounds. A further notice will be taken of the mineral when we\r\ncome to speak of the minerals and fossils found in the mounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.]\r\n\r\nARROW-POINTS.—Arrow-points are abundant throughout the West,\r\nespecially in the valleys where the mounds occur; but although\r\nfrequently found, they are not plentiful in the mounds themselves.\r\nThey are much less numerous than the lance-heads just noticed.\r\nSketches of a number, exhibiting their predominant forms, are given\r\nin the engraving. It will be noticed that they possess a great\r\ndiversity of form. Some are barbed and have a serrated edge quite\r\nas sharp and ragged as the edge of a saw; some are so chipped that\r\nthe line of their edges forms a large angle to their planes, as\r\nif to give them a revolving or «tearing» motion; and others are\r\nnarrow and pointed, as if particularly designed for penetrating\r\ndeeply. If anything were to be gained by it, a classification of\r\nthese relics might be attempted. We might designate those having\r\nserrated edges and barbs, as the «war-arrow», intended not only to\r\npenetrate the flesh, but retain their hold and rankle and fester in\r\nthe wound; those destitute of this feature, as the «peace-arrow», or\r\n«hunter-arrow».\r\n\r\nMany, as has already been remarked, and as will be perceived from\r\nthe [p213] engravings, are delicately wrought, and from the richest\r\nmaterials within the reach of their makers. From one of the mounds in\r\nthat, by this time, familiar locality, Mound City, (see page 149,)\r\nwere taken a number of beautiful ones of transparent or hyaline\r\nquartz, which, from the brilliant play of colors upon their fractured\r\nsurfaces, are real gems. It is not likely that these, and some others\r\nof like delicate material, were used for ordinary purposes, but\r\nrather for display and ornament.[134] From the same mound were also\r\ntaken one or two arrow-points of «obsidian».\r\n\r\nArrow-points, differing from each other only in the variety of stone\r\nof which they are composed, are discovered in all quarters of the\r\nglobe. They have been found in the Scythian tumuli of Siberia, in the\r\ntombs of Egypt,[135] upon the plains of Greece;[136] and in the rude\r\nmonuments of ancient Scandinavia. But whether obtained from Asia,\r\nfrom Europe, Africa, or America, they are almost identical in form\r\nand workmanship, and might readily be mistaken for the productions\r\nof the same people. Their prevalence seems to mark that stage of\r\nman’s progress which the antiquaries of the north of Europe have\r\ndenominated the “stone age,” and which was followed by the “age of\r\nbronze,” and the “age of iron.” The manufacture of these arrow-points\r\ninvolves no inconsiderable degree of skill, as will be very apparent\r\nto any one who has the curiosity to attempt an imitation from the raw\r\nmaterial. It has hence been inferred that it was anciently an art,\r\nlike that of the potter, assigned to a class of armorers or makers\r\nof arrow-heads, whose skill was the result of long experience in the\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.]\r\n\r\nArrow and lance heads, and cutting implements of the numerous\r\nvarieties of quartz, embracing every shade of color and degree of\r\ntransparency, from the dull blue of the ordinary hornstone to the\r\nbrilliant opalescence of the chalcedonic varieties, are frequent\r\nin the mounds. Some are worked with great skill from pure, limpid\r\ncrystals of quartz, others from crystals of manganesan garnet, and\r\nothers still from «obsidian» (the «itzli» of the Mexicans, and\r\n«gallinazo stone» of the Peruvians). It is a singular fact, however,\r\nthat few weapons of stone or other materials are discovered in the\r\nsepulchral mounds; most of the remains found with the skeletons are\r\nsuch evidently as were deemed ornamental, or recognised as badges\r\nof distinction. Some of the altar or sacrificial mounds, on the\r\nother hand, have the deposits within them almost entirely made up\r\nof finished arrow and spear points, intermixed with masses of the\r\nunmanufactured material. From one altar were taken several bushels\r\nof finely worked lance-heads of milky quartz, nearly all of which\r\nhad been broken up by the action of fire. (See page 149.) In another\r\nmound, an excavation six feet long and four broad disclosed upwards\r\nof six hundred spear-heads or discs of hornstone, rudely [p214]\r\nblocked out, and the deposit extended indefinitely on every side.\r\n(See page 158.) Some of these are represented in the accompanying\r\nengraving. They are necessarily much reduced. The originals are\r\nabout six inches long and four broad, and weigh not far from two\r\npounds each. Some specimens from this deposit are nearly round,\r\nbut most are of the shape of those here figured. We are wholly at\r\na loss respecting their purposes, unless they were designed to be\r\nworked into the more elaborate implements to which allusion has\r\nbeen made, and were thus roughly «blocked out» for greater ease of\r\ntransportation from the quarries. With these relics, were found\r\nseveral large nodules of similar material, from which portions had\r\nbeen chipped off, exposing a nucleus, around which the accretion\r\nseems to have taken place. These nodules are covered to the depth\r\nof half an inch, with a calcario-silicious deposit, white, and of\r\ngreat hardness. Such nodules are found in the secondary limestone\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nSeveral localities are known from which the material may have been\r\nobtained. One of these, named “Flint Ridge,” exists in the counties\r\nof Muskingum and Licking, in Ohio. It extends for many miles, and\r\ncountless pits are to be observed throughout its entire length,\r\nfrom which the stone was taken. These excavations are often ten or\r\nfourteen feet deep, and occupy acres in extent. It is possible that\r\nthe late, as well as the more remote races worked these quarries.\r\nLike the red pipe-stone quarry of the «Coteau des Prairies», this\r\nlocality may have been the resort of numerous tribes,—a neutral\r\nground, where the war-hatchet for the time was buried, and all\r\nrivalries and animosities forgotten.\r\n\r\nKNIVES AND OTHER CUTTING INSTRUMENTS.—Knives of flint and obsidian\r\nhave been taken from several of the mounds. Some are identical with\r\nthose of Mexico, most if not all of which were made of obsidian.\r\nThat material, as also some varieties of flint, breaks with a very\r\nclear, conchoidal fracture. With skill and experience in the art,\r\nthe mound-builders, as well as the Mexicans, succeeded in striking\r\noff thin, narrow slips, with edges sharp as razors. Clavigero states\r\nthat so skilful were the Mexicans in the manufacture of obsidian\r\nknives, that a single workman could produce a hundred per hour.\r\nThese answered many of the purposes for which the more delicate\r\ncutting instruments of the present day are used, such as shaving,\r\nand incising in surgical operations, not to mention the part which\r\nthey [p215] performed in the bloody observances of the Aztec ritual.\r\nSeveral knives of this description are represented in the following\r\nengraving, which also exhibits the absolute identity which sometimes\r\nexists between the remains of widely-separated people, and how,\r\nalmost as it were by instinct, men hit upon common methods of meeting\r\ntheir wants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105 Half size.]\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is of flint from a Scandinavian barrow; No. 2 is of hornstone\r\nfrom a mound in Ohio; and No. 3 is obsidian from the pyramids of\r\nTeotihuacan in Mexico. Some of these are not less than six inches\r\nin length and three-fourths of an inch in breadth; others are not\r\nmore than two inches long, and of exceeding delicacy. Besides these,\r\nand constituting a much larger class, are found cutting implements\r\nchipped with great neatness, so as to produce as clear and smooth\r\na cutting edge as practicable. In shape they somewhat resemble an\r\nold-fashioned table-knife. Some are composed of the beautiful hyaline\r\nbefore mentioned, others of obsidian. Some irregular chips of flint\r\nhave been found, with one or more sharp edges, which, it is presumed,\r\nwere used for like purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.]\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of cutting instrument which it may not be\r\nout of place to notice here. These consist of hard compact minerals,\r\nworked into a chisel shape. Some have a very sharp, smooth edge,\r\nand form quite a good substitute for metal. Engravings of two, of\r\nfull size, are herewith presented. They are formed of very compact\r\nnodules of brown hematite, which have been ground into form and\r\npolished with great labor. They have a submetallic lustre, and very\r\nnearly the specific gravity of iron. A file produces a scarcely\r\nperceptible impression upon their rounded surfaces. Another variety\r\nis occasionally found in [p216] the Eastern States, of which Fig.\r\n107 is an example. They are sometimes composed of slate, and are of\r\nvarious sizes, often measuring five or six inches in length. They are\r\nvery well adapted for flaying animals, and other analogous purposes.\r\n\r\nAXES.—The remark made in respect to the occurrence of the\r\narrow-points, is equally true of the ancient axes. Although abundant\r\nin the valleys occupied by the mound-builders, they are not frequent\r\nin the mounds themselves. Those taken from the tumuli do not,\r\nhowever, differ materially from others found scattered over the\r\nsurface of the earth from the St. Lawrence to Panama and the hills\r\nof Chili. They all have the same general features, and vary only in\r\ntheir materials and the style of their workmanship. Some of those\r\nfound in the mounds and elsewhere at the West, are wrought with great\r\nskill, and from rare and beautiful materials, usually of the granitic\r\nor sienitic series of minerals. Amongst the Mexicans and Peruvians,\r\naxes of obsidian, and of basalt, greenstone, etc., were retained in\r\ncommon use, long after the discovery of the art of hardening copper.\r\n\r\nThe form of these relics seems to have been determined entirely by\r\nthe manner in which they were designed to be used. Those intended\r\nfor deadening trees or as war axes, have grooves for the adjustment\r\nof handles. There are many which are destitute of this feature, and\r\nwhich were probably designed to be used as chisels or «gouges».\r\nExamples are given of each of these classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.]\r\n\r\nFig. 108 is a fine specimen of the ancient axe. It was found within\r\nthe large enclosure on Paint creek, noticed on page 58, and is\r\nregarded as a genuine relic of the mound-builders. Its form is almost\r\nidentical with that of the forest axe of the present day. It is made\r\nof a very compact greenstone, and measures eight inches in length\r\nby five inches and a half in its greatest breadth, and weighs eight\r\npounds. The marks of the pointed instrument with which it was chipped\r\ninto form, are still discernible, notwithstanding the long use to\r\nwhich it has evidently been subjected.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these instruments are mounted is apparent enough\r\nfrom their construction, and could hardly be mistaken even though the\r\nexplanation were not furnished by the practice of the tribes still\r\nretaining their use.[137] A tough «withe», or green slip of wood\r\nof proper size was bent into the groove and encircled the axe; the\r\nends were then firmly bound together with ligatures of hide or other\r\nmaterial. [p217] Still further to fasten and render the instrument\r\nfirm and immovable in the handle, it was «wedged» on the inner edge,\r\nwhich usually was slightly hollowed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, from the weight of many of these axes, that they were\r\ndesigned to be wielded with both hands. Some weigh not less than\r\n«fourteen» pounds, but most range from six to ten. The average weight\r\nof the ordinary wood-axe of the present day, is about six pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.]\r\n\r\nEngravings of a number of axes analogous to that above described,\r\nbut less symmetrical in form, are herewith presented, Fig. 109. The\r\nsmaller varieties were probably designed for war-axes or hatchets.\r\nThey weigh from one to two and three pounds, and frequently have\r\nrounded heads, as if to serve the double purpose of hatchet and club.\r\nOccasionally one is found with a double blade, as shown in No. 1 of\r\nthe engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.]\r\n\r\nThe «Hand-axes» are destitute of grooves, and, as already observed,\r\nseem designed to be used as chisels or gouges. They are more numerous\r\nthan the other variety, and are of all sizes, from two inches to a\r\nfoot in length. Some, like Fig. 110, are nearly cylindrical; others,\r\nlike Fig. 111, are gouge-shaped. Fig. 110 is remarkable as being the\r\nonly specimen of this kind of axe recovered from the mounds, under\r\nsuch circumstances as to establish conclusively that it pertained\r\nto the builders. It is composed of greenstone, and the marks of the\r\ntool, by which it was «pecked» into shape, are distinctly visible\r\nupon it. The subjoined engraving (Fig. 112) presents examples of a\r\nnumber [p218] of these axes. No. 3 is composed of tough sienite,\r\nis finely worked, and highly polished. No. 4 is of a species of\r\nvariegated slate, and was found near Middletown, Connecticut.[138]\r\nNos. 1 and 2 are miscellaneous examples; both are composed of\r\ngreenstone. This form of the stone axe is not peculiar to America.\r\nNumbers, differing only in material, are found in almost all parts\r\nof the globe. Fig. 113 represents two, composed of flint, which\r\nwere brought from Denmark, by the late J. F. WOODSIDE, Esq., U. S.\r\nConsul at Copenhagen, and are now in possession of his family, at\r\nChillicothe, Ohio. They were obtained from a Scandinavian barrow. No.\r\n1 seems to have been simply chipped into shape, and never used; No.\r\n2, on the other hand, is well polished, and has evidently seen much\r\nuse. Except in respect to material, they are undistinguishable from\r\nthousands found in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the various kinds of axes above described,\r\nare imperforate. A few implements have however been discovered, which\r\nare generally called hatchets, and which have holes for the reception\r\nof handles. Examples [p219] are given, Fig. 114. It is clear\r\nnevertheless, both from their form and material, that they were not\r\ndesigned for use. They may be regarded as having been intended simply\r\nfor ornament or display. No. 1 is composed of a beautiful talcose\r\nslate of a greenish brown color, slightly veined with dark lines. It\r\nmeasures six inches in length, is two inches and a half broad at the\r\ncentre, and five inches between the tips.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 was found in South Carolina, and is composed of a dark\r\nsteatite. The others were found in Mississippi, and are for the most\r\npart composed of soft and easily-worked stone.[139]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 116.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 117.]\r\n\r\nFig. 115 is of similar material with No. 1, Fig. 114, is highly\r\npolished, and measures six inches in length. The hole is half an inch\r\nin diameter at one end, but less at the other.[140]\r\n\r\nFig. 116 is an example of a kind of hammer or club-head of stone. It\r\nweighs about two pounds. Articles of this kind are not frequent; and\r\nnone have been found in the mounds. It is probable that a withe was\r\npassed around the groove in the middle, and the ends firmly bound\r\ntogether. By this means the implement might be very efficiently used\r\nas a hammer or war-club. Spherical stones are often found, weighing\r\nfrom half a pound to two pounds. The manner in which they were\r\nused is, no doubt, correctly explained by Lewis and Clarke: “The\r\nShoshonee Indians use an instrument which was formerly employed among\r\nthe Chippeways, and called by them «pogamoggon». It consists of a\r\nhandle, twenty-two inches long, made of wood, covered with leather,\r\nabout the size of a whip-handle. At one end is a thong two inches in\r\nlength, which is tied to a stone weighing two pounds, enclosed in a\r\ncover of leather. At the other end is a loop of the same material,\r\nwhich is passed around the wrist to secure the implement, with which\r\nthey strike a powerful blow.” It is probable that the pear-shaped\r\nstones represented in the above engraving, Fig. 117, were used in\r\nlike manner. Carver describes a weapon, in use by the tribes beyond\r\nthe Mississippi river, which consisted of a curiously wrought stone,\r\nenclosed in leather as above, and fastened, like the slung-shot of\r\nthe present day, to a thong, a yard [p220] and a half long, which\r\nwas also wound around the wrist. These weapons were often used in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.]\r\n\r\nPESTLES.—A large number of implements have been discovered, which\r\nhave evidently been used for pounding and reducing maize. Fig. 118\r\npresents examples. These weigh generally not more than four or\r\nfive pounds, though some are much heavier. Occasionally they are\r\nelaborately worked, but most are rude. None of these have been found\r\nin the mounds. Similar articles were in common use among the modern\r\nIndians. Rude mortars of various dimensions, composed of stone, were\r\nalso frequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTS OF BONE.—Pointed or sharpened bones of the deer and\r\nelk have been obtained from the ancient deposits in the mounds.\r\nSeveral are here represented, Fig. 119. They are reduced with entire\r\nregularity; and some of them, notwithstanding their decay, evince\r\nthat they were originally highly polished. Nos. 1 and 3 were obtained\r\nfrom a mound in Cincinnati, and are evidently formed from the tibia\r\nof the elk.[141]\r\n\r\nNo. 2 was taken, together with several others, from a mound near\r\nChillicothe, (see page 178,) and measures eight inches in length. It\r\nis formed from the ulna of the deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.]\r\n\r\nSome very delicate awl-shaped instruments have been found in the\r\nmounds, of which the above are full-sized sketches. They have been\r\nburned, and it is [p221] impossible to tell of what description\r\nof bone they are made. They are as compact as ivory. Judging from\r\nthe abundance of fragments, a considerable deposit must have been\r\nmade where they were found. None were recovered entire; pieces were\r\nnevertheless found three inches in length. Some have round and\r\ntapering, others flat and chisel-shaped points; resembling in this,\r\nas in other respects, the different varieties of awls in use at the\r\npresent day. They were probably used for similar purposes as needles\r\nand bodkins.[142]\r\n\r\nMany implements made of elk and deer horns, and of the bones of the\r\nbuffalo, have been found with the recent deposits in the mounds.\r\nThese are all exceedingly rude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.]\r\n\r\nDISCOIDAL STONES.—A few singular discs of stone have been discovered\r\nin the mounds, which seem related to a very numerous class of relics\r\nfound scattered over the surface, from the valley of the Ohio to\r\nPeru. Those from the mounds will claim our first attention. Fig. 121,\r\nNumbers 3 and 5, are examples. They were taken, in connection with\r\nnumerous other remains, from a mound numbered 1 within the great\r\nenclosure on the North fork of Paint creek. (See Plate X, [p222]\r\nand also page 157). They are simple discs, (cut from plates of\r\nstone,) perfectly circular, but of variable thickness. The largest\r\nmeasures three inches and three fourths in diameter, by one inch and\r\none tenth in thickness; the smallest, two and eight tenths, by nine\r\ntenths. They are of all intermediate sizes; a few have their edges\r\nslightly convex, but most are perfectly plane. Those first found by\r\nindividuals residing in the vicinity, were called “«weights»,” from\r\ntheir resemblance to the iron weights in common use. They are made\r\nof a very dense ferruginous stone, of a black or dark brown ground,\r\nthickly interspersed with minute and brilliant specks of yellow mica;\r\nit receives a remarkably high polish, displaying the mica flakes with\r\ngreat beauty. The material was, not inaptly, termed “«gold stone»”\r\nby the persons who first discovered it. Several delicately carved\r\narticles of this material have been taken from the same locality;\r\nbut it is a singular fact, that none have been found except in this\r\nparticular mound. Judging from the accounts of others, and the number\r\nof fragments of these discs disclosed upon a full investigation of\r\nthe mound, the deposit must have been very considerable; probably not\r\nless than thirty or forty were originally placed there.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that these stones were used in certain games,\r\nanalogous to those known to have been practised by the North American\r\ntribes. The perfect polish of the edges of some of them weighs\r\nagainst this conclusion. They are certainly enigmatical in their\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe numerous class of discoidal stones already referred to, as being\r\nin some degree related to those above described, are composed of\r\na large variety of hard materials,—granite, porphyry, greenstone,\r\njasper, quartz, etc.\r\n\r\nThey are of all sizes from two to six inches in diameter, and of\r\nvariable thickness, seldom, however, less than an inch and a half.\r\nSome have concave sides, often perforated; others are solid or\r\nlenticular in shape, with oblique margins. Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 6,\r\nrepresent four varieties.\r\n\r\nThe sketches and accompanying sections will give a good idea of their\r\ncharacter. Nos. 1 and 2 are the predominant forms, with sides more\r\nor less concave, and centre perforated. Many of this kind are marked\r\nwith radiating lines, resembling bird tracks, as exhibited in No. 1.\r\nOccasionally both surfaces are thus marked. Some of those possessing\r\nconcave sides are imperforate. No. 4 constitutes the simplest form,\r\nand approaches nearest to those found in the mounds; a very few are\r\nobserved of the form represented by No. 6.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger proportion of these relics are worked with great\r\nsymmetry, and are well polished; some, however, of manifestly similar\r\npurpose, are quite rude in workmanship and of coarse materials. None\r\nhave been discovered in the mounds examined by the authors; and it is\r\ndoubtful whether any have been found in them elsewhere, except with\r\nthe recent deposits. We may safely set them down as of comparatively\r\nmodern origin. It is known that, among the Indian tribes on the\r\nOhio, and along the Gulf, such stones were in common use, in certain\r\nfavorite games. Beyond the Mississippi their use is still retained.\r\nThey display considerable skill, but undoubtedly fall within the\r\ncapabilities of a very rude people. Their shape is that most easily\r\nobtained by attrition or grinding with other stones. [p223] Adair\r\ndescribes them, and the game in which they were used, and remarks\r\nthat they were “from time immemorial rubbed smooth on the rocks, and\r\nwith prodigious labor,” and furthermore were so highly valued, “that\r\nthey were kept with the strictest religious care from one generation\r\nto another, and were exempted from being buried with the dead.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that similar stones are found in Denmark, and\r\nMolina describes them as numerous in Chili. We may conclude that they\r\neverywhere had much the same use.[143] [p224]\r\n\r\nRINGS.—Among the implements maybe classed certain small grooved\r\nrings, beautifully worked from stone and bone. Some are composed of\r\nthe micaceous stone, of which the mound discs already described are\r\nmade, and are carved with the utmost delicacy, and highly polished.\r\nThey measure about two inches and three fourths in diameter, and\r\nthe thickness of the periphery is half an inch. They are deeply\r\ngrooved upon the outer edge, and are pierced by eight small holes,\r\nat equal distances from each other, all radiating from the centre.\r\nSimilar rings, of smaller size, have been found, cut from bone. They\r\nare pierced in the same manner with those above described. It is\r\nsuggested that they formed part of a drilling apparatus, something\r\nlike the “bow and drill” of the present day. Several of larger\r\nsize than those here noticed were found, some years since, in a\r\nmound at Cincinnati. A variety of relics are found which resemble\r\npaint-mullers. Some of these are composed of brown hematite, and are\r\nvery symmetrical in figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.]\r\n\r\nTUBES.—Not among the least remarkable and interesting relics,\r\nobtained from the mounds, are the stone tubes, of which several\r\nexamples are given in the subjoined engraving, Fig. 122. They are\r\nall carved from fine-grained materials susceptible of receiving a\r\npolish and of being made ornamental, as well as useful. The finest\r\nspecimen yet discovered, and which can scarcely be surpassed in the\r\ndelicacy of its workmanship, was found in a mound in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Chillicothe. No. 1 is a greatly reduced sketch. It is\r\ncomposed of a compact variety of slate; the ground is brownish or\r\nleaden green, interstratified with veins of pure black, of variable\r\nthickness, from a line to the fourth of an inch. These, when worked\r\nobliquely to their planes, are decidedly ornamental. This stone cuts\r\nwith great clearness, and receives a fine though not glaring polish.\r\nThe tube under notice is thirteen inches long, by one and one tenth\r\nin diameter; one end swells slightly, and the other terminates in\r\na broad, flattened, triangular «mouth-piece», (so called for lack\r\nof a better designation,) of fine proportions, which is carved with\r\nmathematical precision. It is drilled throughout; the bore is seven\r\ntenths of an inch in diameter at the cylindrical end of the tube, and\r\nretains that [p225] calibre until it reaches the point where the\r\ncylinder subsides into the mouth-piece, when it contracts gradually\r\nto one tenth of an inch at the end. The inner surface of the tube\r\nis perfectly smooth, till within a short distance of the point of\r\ncontraction. For the remaining distance the circular striæ, formed by\r\nthe drill in boring, are distinctly marked. The mound in which this\r\nrelic was found is sepulchral in its character, and the burial had\r\nbeen made by fire. One end of the tube is somewhat discolored by the\r\nheat to which it was exposed. The carving, in this instance, is very\r\nfine, and much superior to anything of which the Indians of this day\r\nare known to be capable.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is a sketch of another tube, also found in one of the\r\nsepulchral mounds near Chillicothe (see page 164). It is made of\r\ndifferent material, less beautiful and more destructible than the one\r\njust described,—a variety of limestone. It measures but six inches\r\nin length by three fourths of an inch in diameter; the bore is half\r\nan inch in diameter. The surface is much decomposed; the spots which\r\nhave resisted corrosion are polished to the highest degree. The\r\ninner surface is smooth, and retains a uniform calibre to within a\r\nshort distance of the reduced end, where it contracts, exhibiting\r\nthe circular striæ before noticed. A qualification of the remark\r\nrespecting the calibre is perhaps necessary: at a point one inch\r\nand a half from the smaller end is an offset in the bore. Whether\r\nthis is the result of accident or design, it is not undertaken to\r\nsay; probably the former, as the feature has not been observed in\r\nany others which have fallen under notice. As these tubes have been\r\nregarded with considerable interest, it is deemed proper to note\r\nevery circumstance respecting them, even though not considered of\r\nmuch importance by the investigators themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.]\r\n\r\nFig. 123 represents a tube of somewhat different character.[144] It\r\nis carved from a dark, compact steatite, and measures ten inches in\r\nlength by two inches in diameter at the larger, and one inch and a\r\nthird at the smaller end. The bore is proportioned to the diameter,\r\nand is one and one tenth, and six tenths of an inch at the ends,\r\nrespectively. Upon one side, as if to serve the double purpose of\r\nhandle and ornament, is carved in high relief the figure of an owl,\r\nattached with its back to the tube. This carving is remarkably bold\r\nand spirited, and represents the bird with its claws contracted and\r\ndrawn up, and head and beak elevated as if in an [p226] attitude of\r\ndefence and defiance. The «action» is very fine, but is imperfectly\r\nconveyed by the engraving. The implement weighs little less than\r\nfour pounds. It was found in a mound on the Catawba river, Chester\r\ndistrict, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.]\r\n\r\nFig. 124 is a tube of similar material with that last described.[145]\r\nIt is six inches long; its greatest and least diameters being one\r\ninch and a quarter, and one inch and a half respectively, with a\r\nproportionate bore. At a point about three inches from the larger\r\nend, is an oval hole or «stop». It was found while ploughing, near\r\nMarietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the last two articles were designed as\r\nwind instruments. It is very certain that the skill of the present\r\nday succeeds in producing very indifferent music from them. Either\r\nthe art of playing upon them has sadly deteriorated, or the musical\r\ntaste of the makers was not regulated by existing standards. It\r\nhas further been suggested that tubes of the character of those\r\nfirst described were designed as auxiliary to the eye in making\r\ndistant observations.[146] If it were deemed necessary to attempt an\r\nexplanation of the probable purposes of every relic discovered, a\r\n«conjecture», at least, might be based upon the peculiar mouth-pieces\r\nwhich many of these tubes possess,—namely, that they were used\r\nas «pipes» for smoking purposes. The furthest advance towards\r\ndesignating their purposes, which it is here ventured to make, is to\r\nclass them amongst implements.[147] [p227]\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of tubes, which it may not be improper\r\nto notice in this connection, though partaking rather of the\r\ncharacter of ornaments than implements. Fig. 125, No. 1, represents\r\none of these. It is in the form of a triangular prism, with sides\r\nslightly concave and angles rounded. It is three inches in length\r\nby one and three tenths in diameter at the ends, and is perforated\r\nlongitudinally; the bore is half an inch in diameter. It is of\r\nthe same variety of stone as the large tube first described, and\r\nof similar workmanship. No. 2 is, however, the prevailing form of\r\narticles of this description. It is a hollow cylinder, a little over\r\nfour inches in length, swelling gently from the ends to the centre,\r\nwhere it measures an inch and a quarter in diameter; calibre, half an\r\ninch; material as above. Both these articles are highly polished. It\r\nis possible that they were worn as amulets, or as simple ornaments.\r\nThis notion is favored by the fact, that none have been discovered\r\nwhich are not made of rare and beautiful stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.]\r\n\r\nPIPES.—The mound-builders were inveterate smokers, if the great\r\nnumber of pipes discovered in the mounds be admitted as evidence\r\nof the fact. These constitute not only a numerous but a singularly\r\ninteresting class of remains. In their construction, the skill of the\r\nmakers seems to have been exhausted. Their general form, which may be\r\nregarded as the «primitive» form of the implement, is well exhibited\r\nin the accompanying sketch, Fig. 126. [p228]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.]\r\n\r\nThey are always carved from a single piece, and consist of a flat\r\ncurved base, of variable length and width, with the bowl rising\r\nfrom the centre of the convex side. From one of the ends, and\r\ncommunicating with the hollow of the bowl, is drilled a small hole,\r\nwhich answers the purpose of a tube; the corresponding opposite\r\ndivision being left for the manifest purpose of holding the implement\r\nto the mouth. The specimen above represented is finely carved from\r\na beautiful variety of brown porphyry, granulated with variously\r\ncolored materials,—the whole much changed by the action of fire, and\r\nsomewhat resembling porcelain. It is intensely hard, and successfully\r\nresists the edge of the finest tempered knife. The length of the\r\nbase is five inches, breadth of the same one inch and a quarter. The\r\nbowl is one inch and a quarter high, slightly tapering upwards, but\r\nflaring near the top. The hollow of the bowl is six tenths of an inch\r\nin diameter. The perforation answering to the tube is one sixth of an\r\ninch in diameter, which is about the usual size. This circumstance\r\nplaces it beyond doubt that the mouth was applied directly to the\r\nimplement, without the intervention of a tube of wood or metal. It\r\nwill be observed that it is ornamented with cup-shaped holes, an\r\neighth of an inch broad and about the same depth. Seven of these are\r\nplaced in a circle upon each side of the bowl, which has a line of\r\nthem extending spirally around it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.]\r\n\r\nFig. 127 is another pipe of a coarse-grained granite. It was not\r\nfound in the mounds, but was turned up by the plough, in the vicinity\r\nof one of the large enclosures on the banks of Paint creek. It is\r\nquite unlike those figured above in shape, and perhaps belonged to a\r\nlater race.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general form of these implements. The largest proportion\r\nof those which have been found in the mounds, however, are of much\r\nmore elaborate workmanship. Their character has been briefly noticed\r\non a previous page. (See page 152.) They are sculptured into singular\r\ndevices—figures of the human head, and of various beasts, birds,\r\nand reptiles. These figures are all executed in miniature, but\r\nwith a strict fidelity to nature. The attitudes of the animals are\r\ncharacteristic; their very habits, in some cases, are indicated. Most\r\nare worked in porphyry; and all display a truthfulness, delicacy, and\r\nfinish, which we are unprepared to look for, except among the remains\r\nof a people considerably advanced in the arts. Some of them represent\r\nanimals peculiar to the lower latitudes. Indeed, so remarkable in\r\nmany respects are they regarded, in their bearing upon some of\r\nthe more important questions connected with American archæology,\r\nparticularly the migrations of the race of the mounds, that their\r\nfull consideration is reserved for another place. They will be\r\nnoticed at length, in connection with similar remains, under the more\r\nappropriate head of “«Sculptures».”\r\n\r\nBesides these varieties of pipes, numerous others are found, most\r\nof which are probably referable to a comparatively recent era. They\r\ndiffer in style from those found in the mounds, and are for the\r\ngreater part composed of steatites and other soft and easily worked\r\nvarieties of stone. Some are of large size, and are boldly [p229]\r\nthough not in general elegantly sculptured. They will also be\r\nnoticed under the same head with those last mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of these relics it is fairly inferable that,\r\namong the mound-builders as among the tribes of North American\r\nIndians, the practice of smoking was very general if not universal.\r\nThe conjecture that it was also more or less interwoven with their\r\ncivil and religious observances, is not without its support. The use\r\nof tobacco was known to nearly all the American nations, and the\r\npipe was their grand diplomatist. In making war and in concluding\r\npeace it performed an important part. Their deliberations, domestic\r\nas well as public, were conducted under its influences; and no\r\ntreaty was ever made unsignalized by the passage of the calumet.\r\nThe transfer of the pipe from the lips of one individual to those\r\nof another was the token of amity and friendship, a gage of honor\r\nwith the chivalry of the forest which was seldom violated. In their\r\nreligious ceremonies it was also introduced, with various degrees of\r\nsolemnity. A substitute for tobacco was sometimes furnished in the\r\ntender bark of the young willow; other substitutes were found among\r\nthe Northern tribes in the leaves and roots of various pungent herbs.\r\nThe custom extended to Mexico, where however it does not seem to have\r\nbeen invested with any of those singular conventionalities observed\r\nin the higher latitudes. It prevailed in South America and in the\r\nCaribbean islands. The form of the Indian pipe of North America is\r\nextremely variable, and very much the subject of individual taste.\r\nSome are excessively rude, but most are formed with great labor from\r\nthe finest materials within reach. Along the Mississippi and among\r\nthe tribes to the westward of that river, the material most valued\r\nfor the purpose was, and still is, the red pipe-stone of the «Coteau\r\ndes Prairies», a beautiful mineral resembling steatite, easily worked\r\nand capable of a high finish. The spot whence it is obtained, and\r\nwhich is certainly one of the most interesting mineral localities\r\nof the whole country, is regarded with superstitious veneration by\r\nthe Indians. It is esteemed to be under the special protection of\r\nthe Great Spirit, and is connected with many of their most singular\r\ntraditions. Until very recently it was the common resort of the\r\ntribes, where animosities and rivalries were forgotten, and where the\r\nmost embittered foes met each other on terms of amity. In carving\r\npipes from this material they expended their utmost skill, and we\r\nmay regard them as the «chef d’œuvres» of modern Indian art. The\r\nfollowing engraving, Fig. 128, from originals, will exhibit their\r\npredominant form, which it will be observed is radically different\r\nfrom that of the mound pipes. The larger of the two was once the\r\nfavorite pipe of the eloquent KEOKUK, chief of the Sacs and Foxes,\r\nwhose name occupies a conspicuous place in the Indian history of the\r\nNorth-west. These pipes were smoked with long tubes of wood, from\r\ntwenty inches to three feet in length, fantastically ornamented with\r\nfeathers and beads. [p230]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.]\r\n\r\nThe sculpture of these articles, which is sometimes attempted in\r\nimitation of the human figure and of various animals, is often\r\ntasteful. But they never display the nice observation, and true,\r\nartistic appreciation and skill exhibited by those of the mounds,\r\nnotwithstanding their makers have all the advantages resulting from\r\nsteel implements for carving, and from the «suggestions» afforded\r\nby European art. The only fair test of the relative degrees of\r\nskill possessed by the two races would be in a comparison of the\r\nremains of the mounds with the productions of the Indians before the\r\ncommencement of European intercourse. A comparison with the works of\r\nthe latter however, at any period, would not fail to exhibit in a\r\nstriking light the greatly superior skill of the ancient people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] The Spaniards entertained a strong dread of these weapons.\r\nTheir historians tell some wonderful stories of their efficiency, and\r\naffirm that one stroke was sufficient to cut a man through the middle\r\nor decapitate a horse. The form of this sword, which was called\r\n«mahquahuitl» by the Mexicans, is represented in the accompanying\r\nengraving (Fig. 101).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\nThe Pacific islanders possess similar weapons, formed by inserting\r\nrows of shark’s teeth on the opposite sides of a staff or sword\r\nshaped piece of tough wood, and fastening the same with cords of\r\nnative grass. One of this kind from the Aleutian Islands is here\r\nengraved (Fig 102).\r\n\r\n[134] Lawson, in his account of the Carolina Indians, published in\r\n1709, mentions having seen at an Indian town “very long arrows,\r\nheaded with «pieces of glass», which they had broken from bottles.\r\nThey were shaped neatly, like the head of a dart, but the way they\r\ndid it I can’t tell” (p. 58). It is probable that these arrows were\r\npointed with obsidian or quartz, which would be very liable to be\r\nmistaken for glass. Fremont («Second Expedition», p. 267) observed\r\nsome Indians, of unusually fearless character, on the «Rio de los\r\nAngelos» of Upper California, who possessed arrows “barbed with a\r\nvery clear, translucent stone, a species of opal, nearly as hard as a\r\ndiamond.”\r\n\r\n[135] Wilkinson’s Egypt, vol. iii. p. 261.\r\n\r\n[136] Clarke’s Travels, vol. iii p. 22.\r\n\r\n[137] LOSKIEL says of the axes of the Delaware Indians: “Their\r\nhatchets are wedges, made of hard stones, six or seven inches long,\r\nsharpened at the edge, and attached to a wooden handle. They are not\r\nused to fell trees, but only to peel them, and kill their enemies”\r\n(p. 54). ADAIR, speaking of the Southern tribes, observes: “They\r\ntwisted two or three hickory slips, about two feet long, around the\r\nnotched head of the axe, and by means of this simple and obvious\r\ninvention they deadened the trees, by cutting through the bark, and\r\nburned them when they became thoroughly dry” (p. 405).\r\n\r\n[138] Presented by JOHN HALL, Esq., New York. Nos. 1 and 2 are in the\r\ncabinet of JAMES MCBRIDE, Esq.\r\n\r\n[139] In the cabinets of B. L. C. WAILES, Esq., Washington, Miss.;\r\nand of Rev R. MORRIS, Mount Sylvan, in the same State.\r\n\r\n[140] In the cabinet of JAMES MCBRIDE, Hamilton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[141] In the cabinet of ERASMUS GEST, Esq., and drawn by H. C.\r\nGROSVENOR of Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n[142] “The needles and thread they used formerly (and now at times)\r\nwere fish bones, or the horns or bones of deer rubbed sharp,\r\nand deer’s sinews, and a sort of hemp that grows, among them\r\nspontaneously.”—«Adair’s American Indians», p. 6.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens found a similar implement with the skeleton, in one of\r\nthe ancient tombs near Ticul in Yucatan. “It was made of deer’s\r\nhorn, about two inches long, sharp at the point, with an eye at the\r\nother end. The Indians of the vicinity still use needles of the same\r\nmaterial.”—«Travels in Yucatan», vol. i. p. 279.\r\n\r\n[143] Rev. J. B. Finley (distinguished for his zealous efforts in\r\nchristianizing the Indian tribes of Ohio) states that, among the\r\ntribes with which he was acquainted, stones identical with those\r\nabove described were much used in a popular game resembling the\r\nmodern game of “ten pins.” The form of the stones suggests the manner\r\nin which they were held and thrown, or rather rolled. The concave\r\nsides received the thumb and second finger, the forefinger clasping\r\nthe periphery. Adair, in his notice of the Southern Indians, gives\r\na minute and graphic account of a game somewhat analogous to that\r\ndescribed by Mr. Finley, in which stones of this description were\r\nused. Du Pratz notices the same game, and fully explains the purpose\r\nof the oblique-edged stones, Nos. 4 and 6 of the text. These, when\r\nrolled, would describe a convolute figure. The lines on the stones,\r\nresembling bird-tracks, were probably in some way connected with\r\n“counting” the game.\r\n\r\n“The warriors have another favorite game, called «Chungke»; which,\r\nwith propriety of language, may be called ‘running hard labor.’ They\r\nhave near their state house a square piece of ground well cleaned;\r\nand fine sand is strewed over it, when requisite, to promote a\r\nswifter motion to what they throw along its surface. Only one or\r\ntwo on a side play at this ancient game. They have a stone about\r\n«two fingers broad at the edge and two spans round»; each party has\r\na pole about eight feet long, smooth and tapering at each end, the\r\npoints flat. They set off abreast of each other, at six yards from\r\nthe edge of the playground; then one of them hurls the stone on its\r\nedge, in as direct a line as he can, a considerable distance towards\r\nthe middle of the other end of the square; when they have run a few\r\nyards, each darts his pole, anointed with bear’s grease, with a\r\nproper force, as near as he can guess, in proportion to the motion\r\nof the stone, that the end may lie close to the same;—when this is\r\nthe case the person counts two of the game, and in proportion to\r\nthe nearness of the poles to the mark, one is counted, unless by\r\nmeasurement both are found to be an equal distance from the stone.\r\nIn this manner the players will keep moving most of the day at half\r\nspeed, under the violent heat of the sun, staking their silver\r\nornaments; their nose, finger, and ear rings; their breast, arm, and\r\nwrist plates; and all their wearing apparel, except that which barely\r\ncovers their middle. «All the American Indians» are much addicted\r\nto this game, which appears to be a task of stupid drudgery; it\r\nseems, however, to be of early origin, when their forefathers used\r\ndiversions as simple as their manners. (The hurling stones they use\r\nat present were, from time immemorial, rubbed smooth on the rocks,\r\nand with prodigious labor; they are kept with the strictest religious\r\ncare from one generation to another, and are exempt from being buried\r\nwith the dead.) They belong to the town where they are used, and are\r\ncarefully preserved.”—«Adair’s History of American Indians», p. 402.\r\n\r\n“The warriors practise a diversion which they call the «game of the\r\npole», at which only two play at a time. Each pole is about eight\r\nfeet long, resembling a Roman f, and the game consists in rolling a\r\nflat round stone, about three inches in diameter and one inch thick,\r\n«with the edges somewhat sloping», and throwing the pole in such a\r\nmanner that when the stone rests, the pole may be at or near it. Both\r\nantagonists throw their pole at the same time, and he whose pole\r\nis nearest the stone counts one, and has the right of rolling the\r\nstone.”—«Du Pratz», «History of Louisiana», 1720, p. 366.\r\n\r\nMr. Breckenridge (Views of Louisiana, p. 256) mentions a game popular\r\namong the Arikara, (Riccarees,) played with a «ring of stone». Lewis\r\nand Clarke also mention a game common among the Mandans, similar to\r\nthe one above described, and which was also played with «rings of\r\nstone». Mr. Catlin, (vol. i. p. 132) both describes and illustrates\r\nthe game, which, among the Mandans as well as among the Creeks, was\r\ndenominated “Tchung-kee.”\r\n\r\nDiscoidal stones analogous, if not identical, with these, have been\r\nfound in abundance in Chili. “In the plains and upon the mountains,”\r\nsays Molina, “are to be seen a great number of flat circular stones,\r\nof five or six inches in diameter, with a hole through the middle.\r\nThese stones, which are either granite or porphyry, have doubtless\r\nreceived this form by artificial means, and I am induced to believe\r\nthat they were the clubs or maces of the ancient Chilians, and that\r\nthe holes were perforated to receive the handles.”—«Molina», vol i.\r\np. 56.\r\n\r\n[144] In the possession of J. VAN CLEVE, Esq., of Dayton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[145] In the cabinet of Dr. S. P. HILDRETH, Marietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[146] Several tubes, of very much the same character with those here\r\nreferred to, have been found in the vicinity of the Grave creek\r\nmound. Mr. SCHOOLCRAFT describes them as made out of a compact, blue\r\nand white mottled steatite, measuring from eight to twelve inches in\r\nlength, by one inch and four tenths in diameter, and having a bore\r\nof four fifths of an inch, diminishing at one end to one fifth of an\r\ninch. Our author observes:\r\n\r\n“By placing the eye at the diminished point, the extraneous light\r\nis shut from the pupil, and distant objects more clearly discerned.\r\nThe effect is telescopic, and is the same which is known to be\r\nproduced by directing the sight towards the heavens from the bottom\r\nof a well,—an object which we now understand to have been secured\r\nby the Aztec and Maya races in their astronomical observations, by\r\nconstructing tubular chambers. The quality of the stone, like most of\r\nthe magnesian species, is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is\r\nevident that the circular lines observed in the calibre were produced\r\nby boring. The circular striæ of this process are plainly apparent. I\r\nlearned by inquiry, that a quarry or locality of this species of rock\r\nexists on the banks of Grave creek, some four or five miles above the\r\nmound. This establishes the fact, that they were made here and not\r\nbrought from a distance. The degree of skill evinced by these curious\r\ninstruments is superior to that observed in the pipe-carvings and\r\nother evidences of North American Indian sculpture.”—«Observations\r\non the Grave creek Mound, Transactions of American Ethnological\r\nSociety», vol. i. p. 406.\r\n\r\n[147] According to Vanegas, the “medicine men” of the Californian\r\ntribes of Indians, in their operations for the cure of diseases,\r\nsometimes used tubes of stone. The operation in which they were used,\r\nwas a kind of cautery.\r\n\r\n“One mode was very remarkable, and the good effect it sometimes\r\nproduced heightened the reputation of the physician. They applied\r\nto the suffering part of the patient’s body the «chacuaco», a\r\ntube formed out of a very hard black stone; and through this they\r\nsometimes sucked and at other times blew, but both as hard as\r\nthey were able, supposing that the disease was either exhaled or\r\ndispersed. Sometimes the tube was filled with «cimarron» or wild\r\ntobacco lighted, and here they either sucked in or blew down the\r\nsmoke, according to the physician’s directions, and this powerful\r\ncaustic sometimes, without any other remedy, has been known entirely\r\nto remove the disorder.”—«Vanegas’ California», vol. i. p. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p231]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIV.\r\n ORNAMENTS OF STONE, BONE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the articles found in the mounds may be classed\r\nas ornaments. It is not undertaken to say, however, that all which\r\nfollow under this head were really designed as such. The purposes\r\nof the remains of the mounds generally are so apparent, that little\r\ndoubt can exist as to the place which they should occupy in the\r\nsimple classification here attempted; but there are a few to which\r\nit is extremely difficult to assign a position. For all essential\r\npurposes, approximate conclusions are sufficiently exact; and\r\nalthough a good deal of ingenuity and much space might be expended in\r\nspeculations upon the probable purposes of relics of doubtful use, it\r\nis not likely that the final result would be of much importance in\r\nits bearings upon archæological science.\r\n\r\nBEADS.—The number of beads found in the mounds is truly surprising.\r\nThey may be counted in some instances by hundreds and thousands,—each\r\none the product of no inconsiderable amount of labor, unless our\r\nestimate of the means and facilities at the command of the makers is\r\ngreatly underrated. The character of some of these beads, made of\r\nshell and enveloped in metal, has already been noticed. Others are\r\ncomposed of shell, worked into every variety of shape, round, oblong,\r\nand flattened; others still of animal bones and tusks, and many of\r\n«pearls» and small marine shells,—as the «marginella», «natica»,\r\n«oliva», etc. The perforated teeth of the wild cat, wolf, and shark,\r\nas well as the claws of animals and sections of the small bones of\r\nbirds, were also used in the manner of beads, either for purposes\r\nof distinction and decoration, or as amulets. In all these we\r\nobserve remarkable coincidences with the decorations of the existing\r\ntribes of Indians, who are extravagant in their use of beads and\r\npendants.[148]\r\n\r\nThe beads found with the skeletons, so far as observation has\r\nextended, are composed of shell or tusks of animals,—those of shell\r\ngreatly predominating. The surfaces of some of these are much\r\ndiscolored and corroded; many, however, [p232] retain their polish\r\nand appear quite sound. They resemble sections cut from the ends\r\nof rods or small cylinders, and subsequently more or less rounded\r\nupon the edge: some are quite flat, and resemble the bone buttons\r\nof commerce; others are perfectly round. Their diameter varies from\r\none fourth to three fourths of an inch; the size of the perforation\r\nis also variable, usually, however, about one tenth of an inch. Many\r\nexhibit circular striæ upon their surfaces, identical with those\r\nproduced by turning in a lathe; and it is possible they were formed\r\nby some such process, instead of being slowly and laboriously «worn»\r\ninto shape by rubbing on stones, as was the practice of the modern\r\nIndians. These are composed of the solid portion, the «columella», of\r\nlarge marine shells. In some of the mounds, the unworked columella\r\nhas been found,—heavy and compact; probably that of the «strombus\r\ngigas», which shell is common upon the coasts of Florida.[149]\r\n\r\nIn the sacrificial or altar mounds a much greater variety of beads\r\nis found than in those devoted to sepulture; a fact for which we\r\ncannot account, unless by supposing that the articles most valued\r\nfor their rarity or beauty were those especially dedicated to their\r\nsuperstitions. It is unfortunate, however, that those placed upon the\r\naltars, like everything else thus disposed of, are so much injured by\r\nthe fire as to preserve but little of their former beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.]\r\n\r\nThe bead here represented is composed of shell, and is well wrought.\r\nSome of this description have been obtained, which are not less than\r\ntwo inches in length by half an inch in diameter. Abundance of others\r\nhave been found of similar material but different shape: some are\r\nround, but most are oblong; a few are lens-shaped.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting and remarkable of the whole series are\r\nthe «pearl beads», of which a large number have been found in the\r\naltar or sacrificial mounds. By exposure to the heat, they have lost\r\ntheir brilliancy and consequent value as ornaments; most of them,\r\nindeed, are so much injured that they crumble under the touch. The\r\npeculiarities of their form, and their concentric lamellæ, joined\r\nto the lingering lustre which some retain, place their character\r\nbeyond dispute. Several hundreds in number, and not far from a quart\r\nin quantity, are in our possession, which retain their structure\r\nsufficiently well to be strung and handled. The largest of these\r\nmeasures two and a half inches in circumference, or upwards of three\r\nfourths of an inch in diameter. They are of all intermediate sizes,\r\ndown to one fourth of an inch in diameter. Most are irregular in\r\nform, or pear-shaped; yet there are many perfectly round. They have\r\nbeen obtained from separate localities, several miles apart, and\r\nfrom five distinct groups of mounds. Great numbers were so much\r\ncalcined, that it was found impossible to recover them, and a large\r\nnumber crumbled in pieces after removal from the mounds. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say [p233] that a number of quarts of pearls were\r\noriginally deposited in the mounds referred to; probably nearly two\r\nquarts were contained in a single mound.\r\n\r\nIt may be inquired whence these pearls were obtained. Occasional\r\nspecimens are found in the fresh water molluscs of this region, but\r\nthey are exceedingly rare. They are very seldom discovered by our\r\nindefatigable naturalists on the Scioto, (some of whom annually\r\ncollect thousands of the living shells,) and are never found of sizes\r\nat all comparable to those of the mounds. We know that among the\r\nnatives of the West Indies, and the tribes of the Gulf, pearls were\r\nfound in great abundance. Raleigh, Greenville, and others speak of\r\nthem among the nations on the coasts of Virginia and the Carolinas;\r\nand Soto and Ribaulde observed large quantities among the tribes\r\nof Florida. It is a curious fact, that the Indians, observing the\r\neagerness with which Soto’s followers sought them, directed him,\r\naccording to the chronicler, “to search certaine grauves that were in\r\nthe town, and that he should find many; and that if he would send to\r\nthe grauves of these dispeopled towns he might load all his horses;\r\nand they sought the grauves of the town, and there found fourteen\r\n«rooxes» of perles, [three hundred and ninety-two pounds,] and little\r\nbabies and birds made of them.” At another place the chronicler\r\nobserves, they found “some perles of small valew, spoiled with the\r\nfire, which the Indians do string them like beads and weare them\r\nabout their necks and hand wrists, and they esteem them very much.”\r\nIt is certainly not impossible that the “graves of the deserted\r\ntowns” were the mounds themselves; for nothing could possibly be more\r\nin opposition to the Indian character, than to direct the hand of the\r\ninvaders to the tombs of their own dead. An extreme and religious\r\nveneration and respect for the “graves of their fathers,” universally\r\ncharacterizes the North American tribes.[150] They have been known\r\nto undertake long journeys to visit their ancient burial-places, and\r\nthere perform the few simple rites enjoined by their superstitions.\r\nSuch tributes were supposed to be grateful to the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.]\r\n\r\nNumerous beads composed of various small marine shells, of the genera\r\n«marginella, oliva», and «natica», pierced longitudinally, have been\r\ndiscovered. These are all found upon our Southern and South-western\r\ncoasts, and in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nAnother species of beads found in the mounds, were made from some of\r\nthe more beautiful varieties of the shells of the unios, so cut and\r\nstrung as to exhibit [p234] the convex surface and pearly nacre of\r\nthe shell. These must have formed very tasteful ornaments. Some neck\r\nornaments identical in form and appearance with these were obtained\r\nby the Exploring Expedition, from Paumotou in the Pacific; they are\r\nmade of mother of pearl.\r\n\r\nOther beads are composed of sections of the small bones of birds.\r\nSimilar ornaments are common among the Indians to the west of\r\nthe Mississippi, and have been observed among the natives of the\r\nCaribbean islands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these several varieties of neck ornaments, may be\r\nenumerated the perforated canine teeth of certain animals, the wild\r\ncat, wolf, and bear; also, the teeth of the shark and the alligator,\r\nand the claws of animals. The latter, separated from the foot at the\r\nfirst articulation, have been found in considerable numbers. Fig. 131\r\npresents examples of these varieties. Some large imperforate teeth\r\nof animals have been found with skeletons in such positions as to\r\nfavor the conclusion that they were inserted into the lobes of the\r\near. No. 5 of the cut is an example. Several large «fossil» teeth of\r\nthe shark, some of them perforated, have also been obtained from the\r\nmounds, and will be noticed, together with other singular remains of\r\nlike character, under the head of “«Fossils and Minerals from the\r\nMounds».” These relics were perhaps worn as amulets or charms.[151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.]\r\n\r\nA very tasteful variety of enamelled beads is frequently found upon\r\nthe surface or with the recent deposits in the mounds. They are\r\nvery erroneously supposed by some to have pertained to the race of\r\nthe mounds; so far is this from being the case, that they are all\r\nclearly of European origin. The early voyagers availed themselves,\r\nfor purposes of traffic with the Indians, of their love of ornament,\r\n[p235] and “brought from the potteries and glass-houses of Europe\r\nvarious substitutes for the native wampum, in the shape of white,\r\nopaque, transparent, blue, black, and other variously colored beads,\r\nand of as many various forms as the genius of geometry could well\r\ndevise. They also brought over a species of paste-mosaic, or curious\r\noval or elongated beads of a kind of enamel or paste, skilfully\r\narranged in layers of various colors, which, viewed at their poles,\r\npresented stars, radii, or other figures.”[152]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.]\r\n\r\nPENDANTS.—These ornaments are of frequent occurrence in the vicinity\r\nof the ancient works, though seldom found, if indeed found at all,\r\nin the ancient mounds themselves. They for the most part resemble\r\nthe «plumbs» of the architect, and are usually made of rare and\r\nbeautiful materials. No. 1 may be taken as the predominant form. It\r\nis symmetrically worked from a variety of greenstone, interspersed\r\nwith large crystals of mica. It is drawn of half the dimensions of\r\nthe original, which measures three and a half inches in length by\r\none and a fourth in its greatest diameter, and weighs not far from\r\nfour ounces. No. 2, also of half size, is well worked from a dark\r\nbrown hematite, and is highly polished. No. 3 is also of hematite.\r\nIt differs from the others in its shape, which is double conoid,\r\nand has the groove around the middle. Hematite seems to have been\r\na favorite material for these ornaments. No. 5 is of quartz, and\r\nis much the rudest which has fallen under notice. These articles\r\nwere all evidently designed for suspension. It has been suggested\r\nthat they were used as ear ornaments; their weight, however, seems\r\ntoo considerable for such a purpose. To this day some of the savage\r\ntribes have the lobes of their ears greatly distended, in the\r\nlanguage of the early writers, “like hoops,” and the disfiguration is\r\ndeemed a great improvement upon nature. “Some of the Indians,” says\r\nLawson, “wear great «bobs» in their ears, and sometimes in the holes\r\nthereof they put eagle’s feathers, for a trophy.”[153] [p236]\r\n\r\nGORGETS.—Numerous relics of the description here presented are\r\nfound in the mounds, generally with the skeletons. They seem to be\r\nidentical in purpose, (differing only in respect of material,) with\r\nthe articles of metal, described under this division (Figs. 89 and\r\n90) in a previous page. They consist of plates or tablets of rare or\r\nbeautiful stones, such as may easily be worked, and which admit of a\r\nhigh finish. In shape they are as diverse as fancy can suggest, but\r\nalways of tasteful outline. Some are square, others oblong, oval,\r\ncruciform, or lozenge-shaped. Some are perforated with one, but\r\nmost with two holes; the latter have always one, occasionally both,\r\nsurfaces perfect planes.[154] Many have considerable thickness and\r\ndisplay one face in relief; those with a single perforation often\r\nhave both faces slightly convex. They exhibit, in general, much care\r\nand labor, and are elegantly finished. A few have been discovered\r\nwhich are quite rude, but possessing the general form of those more\r\nelaborately worked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.]\r\n\r\nFig. 133. No. 1 is composed of a very compact limestone. The surface\r\nis much corroded, but there are a few spots where it retains its\r\noriginal condition, and these exhibit a very high polish. Its form is\r\nsufficiently well indicated in the sketch. It measures, in length,\r\nthree and a half inches; in width two inches; in thickness one inch\r\nand one tenth. It was found in a sepulchral mound near Chillicothe.\r\n(See page 164.) No. 2 is of the beautiful veined slate already\r\ndescribed (page 224). Length, three inches; width, one and three\r\nfourths; thickness, three fourths of an inch. Found on the surface of\r\nthe earth near Chillicothe. [p237]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.]\r\n\r\nFig. 134 is of similar material with that last mentioned. It is three\r\ninches long, one and three fourths wide, and three fourths of an inch\r\nthick. Fig. 135 (half size) differs in material and shape from those\r\nabove described. It is composed of a compact ferruginous stone, much\r\naltered by heat, and was found on the altar in the remarkable “Pipe\r\nMound,” in “Mound City” (page 152). It has but a single perforation.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the holes in the three specimens first\r\nnoticed, as also in some of those which follow, are placed exactly\r\nfour fifths of an inch apart. This could hardly have been the result\r\nof accident. These relics were found at different localities, several\r\nmiles distant from each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.]\r\n\r\nThe above engraving presents at one view seventeen figures of as\r\nmany different relics of this description,—all of which, with the\r\nexception of No. 7, and Nos. 12 to 17, are drawn of one fourth the\r\nsize of the originals. [p238]\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is a vertical view of Fig. 133, No. 1, and is introduced here\r\nbetter to illustrate its form. No. 2 was found at Marietta, and is\r\nin the cabinet of Dr. Hildreth of that town. It measures: length,\r\nthree inches and a half; width, one inch and nine tenths; thickness,\r\nthree fourths of an inch. The material resembles that of which No.\r\n1 is composed. No. 3 is of similar material, and was found beside\r\na skeleton, in a mound formerly standing within the limits of\r\nChillicothe.[155] Dimensions: length, six and a half inches; width at\r\ncentre, two inches; thickness, four fifths. Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,\r\nand 11, as also Nos. 15, 16, and 17, were found at various points in\r\nthe Miami valley, and are in the possession of Mr. McBride. Most are\r\nof slate, either dark or variegated. No. 7 is cruciform in shape, and\r\nis composed of coralline limestone, of a very beautiful variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.]\r\n\r\nThese illustrations might be indefinitely multiplied. The above will,\r\nhowever, give a very clear conception of the general character of\r\nthis singular class of relics. Fig. 137 illustrates the manner of the\r\nperforation. The holes are bevelled from one or both surfaces, and\r\nat the narrowest point are seldom more than one eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The circular striæ left in the process of boring, are to be\r\nobserved with great distinctness in almost every instance.\r\n\r\nThese relics have been classed as «gorgets», from their «apparent»\r\npurpose. It is not undertaken to say that such was their real\r\npurpose, for none of the many curious remains obtained from the\r\nmounds have more successfully baffled scrutiny. At first glance it\r\nseems obvious that they were designed for suspension, but there\r\nare many circumstances which it is not easy to reconcile with that\r\nconclusion. In common with the perforated copper plates, already\r\ndescribed, they exhibit slight traces of friction upon the edges of\r\nthe holes, which for the most part are as sharp as if newly cut.\r\nThis could hardly be the case had they been worn suspended from the\r\nneck or upon any part of the person. Their material, shape, and\r\nstyle of workmanship, would seem to imply an ornamental purpose. It\r\nhas been suggested that they were designed as implements, probably\r\nfor condensing the raw hide or sinews used as bow-strings. This\r\nhypothesis is founded upon the character of the perforation, which\r\nis certainly such as would best subserve the purpose suggested;\r\nbut the slight evidence of friction, already remarked, constitutes\r\nan objection to this conclusion which it is difficult to surmount.\r\n[p239]\r\n\r\nThe specimen dug up within the limits of Chillicothe, is said to have\r\nbeen found resting upon the breast of the skeleton with which it was\r\ndeposited. The recollection of different individuals varies upon that\r\npoint; hence no conclusion can be founded upon the position in which\r\nthe relic was discovered. Those taken from the sepulchral mounds have\r\nuniformly been found by the side of the skeleton, near the bones of\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nWhatever their purposes, whether worn as ornaments or badges of\r\nauthority and distinction, or designed as implements, it is certain\r\nthey were in very general use. Not far from one hundred have been\r\nexamined, which were procured from localities extending over the\r\nStates of Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, and\r\nIndiana.[156]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.]\r\n\r\nFig. 138 (half size) also presents examples of a large class of\r\nremains probably of kindred character with those last described,\r\nand, like them, always composed of an ornamental kind of stone. The\r\nengravings will best illustrate their form, which, in almost every\r\nspecimen, is slightly varied. They have holes perforated diagonally,\r\nat their lower corners, in which marks of wear from suspension or\r\nuse are distinctly visible. The field of their occurrence is equally\r\nextensive with that of the relics last described.\r\n\r\nIt may reasonably be concluded from the uniform shape of these\r\narticles, and from their apparent unfitness as implements, as also\r\nfrom the wide range of their occurrence, that they were invested with\r\na conventional significance as insignia or badges of distinction or\r\nas amulets. We know that the custom of wearing certain stones as\r\npreventives of disease, or as safeguards against accidents or the\r\nmalice of evil spirits, has not been confined to one continent or a\r\nsingle age. It is not entirely obliterated among certain classes of\r\nour own people. Regal authority is still indicated by rich baubles of\r\ngold and gems. It matters little whether the [p240] index of royalty\r\nbe a sceptre, or a simple carved and polished stone, so that it is\r\nsanctioned with general recognition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.]\r\n\r\nFig. 139 (half size) is made of a beautiful variety of quartz, of\r\na white ground, clouded with green. It is smoothly wrought and\r\npolished, and is perforated from the ends. The shape is well shown by\r\nthe engraving and supplementary section. It was probably designed for\r\nsuspension, as an ornament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.]\r\n\r\nFig. 140 (quarter size) is wrought from the beautiful variegated\r\nslate so often referred to. It is marked upon its upper convex\r\nedge with notches, twenty-eight in number. Its purpose must remain\r\nentirely a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.]\r\n\r\nMICA ORNAMENTS.—Thin sheets of mica, cut in the form of scrolls,\r\ndiscs, etc., have been occasionally found in the mounds. Fig. 141\r\npresents examples. The scrolls, in this instance, measure six\r\ninches in length, and the discs are two inches in diameter. These\r\nare composed of the silvery or opaque mica, and are shaped with the\r\nutmost precision. The edges are perfectly smooth, as if cut with a\r\nvery sharp instrument. They exhibit not the slightest irregularity,\r\nbut are geometrically correct. Each piece is perforated with a small\r\nhole, such as would be formed by thrusting a blunt needle through\r\nit. They were probably in some way attached as ornaments to the\r\ndress.[157] [p241]\r\n\r\nIn the Grave creek mound were found, with one of the skeletons,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty bits of mica, an inch and a half or two\r\ninches square, each perforated with two or more small holes. These\r\nslips were about the thickness of ordinary writing paper, and it\r\nis supposed they were attached together, forming a sort of scarf\r\nor ornamental article of dress.[158] Many of the mounds, it may\r\nhere be observed, contain mica, sometimes in plates of considerable\r\nthickness, but usually in simple folia, with ragged outlines.\r\n\r\nIn a mound excavated a year or two since near Lower Sandusky,\r\nOhio, upwards of twenty oval plates of mica of great beauty were\r\ndiscovered, each perforated with a small hole at one end, evidently\r\nfor the purpose of suspension. They were of the beautiful variety\r\nof the mineral known as “hieroglyphic” or “graphic” mica, and the\r\nnatural markings were taken by the persons who discovered them to be\r\nveritable hieroglyphics—the records of an extinct people.\r\n\r\nMost of the relics found in the mounds fall under the foregoing heads\r\nof classification. There are many, however, the purposes of which are\r\nentirely enigmatical. Whether designed as implements or ornaments,\r\nor whatever their particular purpose, it is not easy, and probably\r\nof not much importance, to determine. They are only valuable as\r\nillustrations of the skill of their makers, and can have but a slight\r\nbearing upon the more important questions connected with American\r\narchæology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[148] Clavigero says of the ancient Mexicans: “It would be difficult\r\nto find a nation which accompanied so much simplicity of dress with\r\nso much variety and luxury in other ornaments of their persons.\r\nBesides feathers and jewels, with which they adorned their clothes,\r\nthey wore ear-rings, pendants at the upper lip, and many likewise\r\nat their noses, necklaces, bracelets for the hands and arms, and\r\nalso certain rings like collars around their legs. The ear-rings and\r\npendants of the poor were shells, pieces of crystal, amber, or some\r\nother shining little stones; but the rich wore pearls, emeralds,\r\namethysts, or other gems, set in gold.”\r\n\r\n[149] Several thousands of these beads were found in the Grave creek\r\nmound. They are much thinner than those discovered in the Scioto\r\nvalley; otherwise they closely resemble them. They were for a long\r\ntime supposed to be «ivory». Their true character was first detected\r\nby Mr. Schoolcraft. See Transactions of American Ethnological\r\nSociety, vol. i. p. 398.\r\n\r\n[150] “The tombs of the dead,” says Charlevoix, “are held so sacred\r\nin this country, that to violate them is the greatest hostility that\r\ncan be committed against a nation.”—«Canada», vol. 2, p. 153.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the North American Indians inter the whole riches of\r\nthe deceased with him, and so make his corpse and the grave heirs to\r\nall, they never give them the least disturbance;—even a blood-thirsty\r\nenemy will not despoil or disturb the dead.”—«Adair», p. 178.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Columbia river, it seems, have less faith in the\r\nveneration of their race. They take care to bend the gun barrels,\r\nbreak holes in the vessels, and otherwise render valueless the\r\nvarious articles deposited with their dead; thereby removing the\r\ntemptation to sacrilege.\r\n\r\n[151] “Amulets and neck and ear ornaments constituted a very ancient\r\nand important department in the arcanum of the Indian’s wardrobe.\r\nThey were connected with his superstitions, and were part of the\r\nexternal system of his religion. The aboriginal man who had never\r\nlaid aside his oriental notions of necromancy, and believed firmly in\r\nwitchcraft, wore them as charms. They were among the most cherished\r\nand valued articles he could possibly possess. They were sought\r\nwith great avidity, at high prices, and, after having served their\r\npurposes of warding off evil while he lived, were deposited in his\r\ngrave at his death. Bones, shells, carved stones, gems, claws and\r\nhoofs of animals, feathers of carnivorous birds, and above all the\r\nskins of serpents, were cherished with the utmost care and regarded\r\nwith the most superstitious veneration. To be decked with suitable\r\namulets, was to him to be invested with a charmed life. They added to\r\nhis feeling of security and satisfaction in his daily avocations, and\r\ngave him new courage in war.”—«Schoolcraft’s Notes on the Iroquois»,\r\np. 226.\r\n\r\n[152] SCHOOLCRAFT, “Notes on the Iroquois,” p. 227. It is undoubted\r\nthat some of the Indian tribes to the west of the Mississippi\r\nhave the art, it is not presumed to say how or where acquired, of\r\nmaking a sort of enamelled beads, which they contrive to color of\r\nvarious shades. Some of these, of tolerable workmanship, are in\r\nthe cabinet of the authors. They were obtained from the celebrated\r\n«Fond de Bœuf», into which they were thrown under some superstitious\r\nimpulse. Lewis and Clarke give an account of the manufacture of these\r\nornaments, which is fully sustained by the peculiarities of the beads\r\nhere mentioned.\r\n\r\n[153] LAWSON’S Carolina, p. 193. We have discovered none of these\r\nornaments in the mounds, and it is difficult to say whether or not\r\nthey are genuine relics of the mound-builders. It is possible they\r\nwere used both by the earlier and later races. In the Museum of\r\nthe East India Society at Salem, Mass., are a number of articles\r\nof similar character, which were found while making excavations in\r\nthat city. They are larger and of much ruder workmanship than those\r\nof Ohio, but of the same shape, and grooved in like manner. It has\r\nbeen suggested that those of hematite, which are most numerous, were\r\ncarried about the person for the purpose of supplying an ornamental\r\npaint. Rubbed upon any sharp grit with water, they furnish a dull\r\nred pigment,—much inferior, however, to the French preparations\r\nfor the toilette. Irregular fragments of the same material are\r\nsometimes found bearing the marks of frequent trituration. Such may\r\nhave been the secondary use of some of these articles; the frequent\r\noccurrence of those made from other materials establishes that they\r\nwere primarily designed for other purposes. One composed of pieces of\r\ncopper, rudely hammered together with little slips of silver inserted\r\nin the crevices, was found at Marietta, and is now in the cabinet of\r\nthe Worcester Antiquarian Society; another, found at Cincinnati, and\r\ncomposed of quartz crystal, is in the Museum of the Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia. Although found in mounds, it is exceedingly\r\ndoubtful whether they were part of the original deposits.\r\n\r\n[154] One of these articles, in the possession of Dr. Hildreth of\r\nMarietta, Ohio, is fourteen inches in length and is perforated with\r\nno less than «seven» holes. This seems to have been an exception to\r\nthe general rule, perhaps it was designed for a different purpose.\r\n\r\n[155] A relic, almost identical in shape with No. 4, was found in\r\nthe great mound at Grave creek, and was supposed to be «ivory»,\r\naltered by long exposure in the earth. («American Pioneer», vol. ii.\r\np. 200.) Mr. Schoolcraft, who examined it subsequently, describes it\r\nas “white, heavy, easily cut, moist, and possessing very much the\r\nappearance and feel of certain oxides,” and suggests that a plate of\r\nsome oxidable metal may still exist in the centre. («Transactions of\r\nAmerican Ethnological Society», vol. i. p. 402.) This description\r\nwould have applied to the articles described in the text, at the\r\nperiod of their removal from the earth. They, however, lost their\r\nmoist feel and became quite hard upon exposure to the air. The\r\nmaterial was a matter of speculation, until the fracture of one of\r\nthe relics disclosed its character. The Grave creek relic measures\r\nsix and a half inches in length.\r\n\r\n[156] ADAIR mentions ornaments worn by the “high priests” of the\r\nSouthern tribes of Indians, which may have been identical with\r\nthose here described. He says: “The American archi-magus wears a\r\nbreast-plate, made of a white conch shell, with two holes bored in\r\nthe middle of it, through which he puts the ends of an otter-skin\r\nstrap, and fastens a buck-horn button to the outside of each.”\r\n(«Adair’s American Indians», p. 84.) Our author does not fail to\r\nidentify this badge with the sacred urim and thummim of the Jewish\r\nhigh priest, and draws a notable argument therefrom in support of his\r\nhypothesis of the Jewish origin of the American Indians. A similar\r\nornament is mentioned by Beverly, as one of the principal decorations\r\nof the Indians of Virginia. He describes it as “a tablet of fine\r\nshell, smooth as polished marble.” («History of Virginia», p. 141.)\r\n\r\n[157] Humboldt states that the «Guaynares» of the Rio Caura in South\r\nAmerica are accustomed to stain themselves with arnotto, and to make\r\nbroad transverse stripes on the body with some unctuous substance on\r\nwhich they stick spangles of silvery mica. Seen at a distance they\r\nappear to be dressed in lace clothes («Pers. Narration», ch. xxiv.)\r\nOther nations, both of South and North America, used gold dust or\r\nother shining material, “with which they sprinkled their bodies and\r\nseemed to be gilt.” («Hackluyt», vol. 2, p. 57.)\r\n\r\n[158] Mr. Schoolcraft observes that some of the Algonquin bands,\r\non the sources of the Mississippi, construct war-scarfs out of the\r\nbrilliant-colored filaments of skins, ornamented with shells and the\r\nquills of the porcupine, and with the fine black points of deer’s\r\nhoofs to produce a jingling sound. These are attached by strings\r\nto the breast, and are worn only by the warriors.—«Transactions of\r\nAmerican Ethnological Society», vol. i. p. 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p242]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XV.\r\n SCULPTURES FROM THE MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the carvings in stone, already noticed, display no\r\ninconsiderable degree of taste and skill. There is, however, a\r\nlarge class of remains, comprising sculptural tablets, and heads\r\nand figures of animals, which belongs to a higher grade of art.\r\nMany of these exhibit a close observance of nature and a minute\r\nattention to details, such as we could only expect to find among\r\na people considerably advanced in the minor arts, and to which\r\nthe elaborate and laborious, but usually clumsy and ungraceful,\r\nnot to say unmeaning, productions of the savage can claim but a\r\nslight approach. Savage taste in sculpture is generally exhibited\r\nin monstrosities,—caricatures of things rather than faithful\r\ncopies. The dawn of art is marked by a purer taste; the result of\r\nan appreciation of the beauties of nature which only follows their\r\nclose observance. The aim of the neophyte is to imitate, rather than\r\ndistort, the objects which he sees before him. It is in this view\r\nthat the sculptures taken from the mounds seem most remarkable; they\r\nexhibit not only the general form and features of the objects sought\r\nto be represented, but frequently, and to a surprising degree, their\r\ncharacteristic attitudes and expression.\r\n\r\nIt will, of course, be understood that nothing of the imposing\r\ncharacter of many of the sculptured relics of Central America is\r\nfound in the mounds. Aside from the stupendous earth structures,\r\nwhich deserve to be classed with the most wonderful remains of\r\nancient power and greatness, there is nothing imposing in the\r\nmonuments of the Mississippi valley. We have no sculptured façades\r\nof temples and palaces, invested with a symbolic meaning or\r\ncommemorative of the exploits of chiefs and conquerors, nor have\r\nwe ponderous statues of divinities and heroes,—nothing beyond the\r\nsimplest form of stone structures. We must therefore estimate the\r\nminor sculptures which we discover here by other standards than\r\nthose of Mexico and Peru, with which, from certain resemblances in\r\nother monuments, a comparison would be most likely to be suggested.\r\nThey are simple in form as in design, and, as works of art, beyond\r\na faithful observance of nature and great delicacy of execution,\r\nlittle can be claimed for them. In these respects they are certainly\r\nremarkable, and will be the more admired, the more closely they are\r\ninspected.\r\n\r\nSome of these sculptures have a value, so far as ethnological\r\nresearch is concerned, much higher than they can claim as mere works\r\nof art. This value is derived from the fact that they faithfully\r\nrepresent animals and birds peculiar to other latitudes, thus\r\nestablishing a migration, a very extensive intercommunication, or\r\na contemporaneous existence of the same race over a vast extent of\r\ncountry. [p243] The interesting inquiry here involved will be more\r\nappropriately made in another place, after an examination of the\r\nrelics themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that no relics which were obviously designed\r\nas «idols» or objects of worship have been obtained from the mounds.\r\nSuch are occasionally discovered on the surface, but none, so far as\r\nknown, within the enclosures deemed sacred or defensive. Those which\r\nhave been found are all of exceedingly rude workmanship, quite unlike\r\nany of the authenticated mound remains. They are more abundant in the\r\nregion towards the Gulf than upon the Ohio, though not of frequent\r\noccurrence there. It is perhaps not to be wondered at that we\r\ndiscover none of these in the mounds, if our estimate of the purposes\r\nto which those structures were appropriated is a correct one.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the following illustrations of this branch of our\r\nsubject, it will not be out of place to repeat the observation\r\nalready once made, that, in the construction and ornament of their\r\npipes, the mound-builders seem to have expended their utmost skill in\r\nsculpture. Accordingly most of the objects represented will be found\r\nto have subserved the purposes of pipes; but as the peculiarities\r\nof these implements have been sufficiently explained under the\r\nappropriate head, their bases and unessential parts have sometimes\r\nbeen omitted in the engravings. In many instances, the remains\r\nwere so much broken up by the action of the fire, that it has been\r\nfound impossible fully to restore them, although the utmost care\r\nwas expended in collecting the fragments. This will account for the\r\nimperfect character of some of the illustrations. It would have been\r\nan easy matter to have restored many of these relics with the pencil,\r\nbut it has been preferred to present an actual fragment rather than\r\na fanciful whole. All the remains which follow, unless otherwise\r\nspecially noted, were taken from the mounds by the authors in person,\r\nand are at present deposited in their collection. They comprise,\r\nhowever, but a limited selection from the whole number; no more being\r\npresented than are deemed sufficient to give the reader a clear\r\nconception of their general character and great variety. The scale\r\nupon which they are drawn is, generally, full size; when this is not\r\nthe case, the dimensions are specially given.\r\n\r\nSCULPTURES OF THE HUMAN HEAD.—Few sculptures of the human head have\r\nbeen found in the mounds, though several have been discovered under\r\nsuch circumstances as to leave little doubt that they belong to the\r\nmound era. Four specimens were taken from the remarkable altar mound,\r\nNo. 8, “Mound City,” three of which constitute the bowls of pipes.\r\nFront and profile views of each of these are herewith presented, of\r\nthe size of the originals.\r\n\r\nFig. 142 is composed of a hard, compact, black stone, and is\r\ndistinguished from the others by the hardness and severity of its\r\noutline. It has a singular head-dress, falling in a broad fold\r\nover the back of the head, as far down as the middle of the neck.\r\nUpon each side of the top of the head this head-dress, which may\r\nrepresent some particular style of platting the hair, rises into\r\nprotuberances or knots. [p244] Encircling the forehead, and coming\r\ndown as low as the ears, is a row of small round holes, fifteen in\r\nnumber, placed as closely as possible together, which, when the head\r\nwas found, were filled in part with pearls, completely calcined and\r\nonly recognisable from their concentric lamination. The holes were\r\ndoubtless all originally filled in the same manner. The ornamental\r\nlines upon the face are rather deeply cut; their form is accurately\r\nindicated in the engravings. Those radiating from around the mouth\r\nmight readily be supposed to represent a curling moustache and beard.\r\nThe mouth of this miniature head is somewhat compressed, and the brow\r\nseems contracted, giving it an aspect of severity, which is not fully\r\nconveyed by the engraving. The eyes are prominent and open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.]\r\n\r\nFig. 143 resembles the one last described only in respect to the\r\npeculiar markings on the face, already noticed. Its features are\r\nbolder, and the outline of the face quite different. The nose is\r\nlarge and prominent, the eyes sunken and apparently closed, and\r\nthe forehead high and narrow. The head-dress is very remarkable. A\r\nportion of the hair seems gathered in festoons upon either side of\r\nthe head above the ears, the remainder centering in a kind of knot\r\nupon the back of the head. The top of the head is covered with a sort\r\nof lappet or fold, which seems detached from the other portions of\r\nthe head-dress, simply resting upon the crown. The ears were each\r\nperforated; and from the strongly attached oxide of copper at those\r\npoints, were probably ornamented with rings of that [p245] metal.\r\nThis head, unlike the others, does not constitute a pipe bowl, but\r\nseems, from the fracture, to have been attached, at the lower and\r\nback part, to a rod carved from the same stone. The base, shown in\r\nthe engraving, is simply an addition of plaster to sustain the head\r\nin a vertical position. The material, in this instance, is a compact\r\nyellowish stone, too much altered by the fire to be satisfactorily\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.]\r\n\r\nFig. 144 is composed of the same material with that last described.\r\nIts features are more regular than those of either of the preceding\r\nexamples. The nose turns up slightly at the point, and the lips are\r\nprominent. The eyes seem closed, and the whole expression of the\r\nface is a repose like that of death. The head-dress is simple; and\r\nthe ears, which are large, are each perforated with four small holes\r\naround their upper edges. At the lower and posterior portion of the\r\nhead are drilled, in convergent directions, two holes, each one fifth\r\nof an inch in diameter and half an inch deep. Were they continued one\r\nfourth of an inch further in the same direction, they would intersect\r\neach other. This head is destitute of markings upon the face. It has\r\nbeen suggested, from the greater delicacy of the features, that this\r\nwas designed to represent a female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.]\r\n\r\nFig. 145. This is the most beautiful head of the series, and is\r\nevidently that of a female. It is carved from a compact stone, which\r\nis much altered, and in some places the color entirely changed by\r\nthe action of the fire. The muscles of the face are [p246] well\r\nexhibited, and the forehead finely moulded. The eyes are prominent\r\nand open, and the lips full and rounded. Whether the head is encased\r\nin a sort of hood, or whether the hair is platted across the forehead\r\nand down the sides of the face, it is not easy to say. The knots\r\nobservable at the top of the forehead, and just back of the ears, may\r\nbe designed to represent the manner in which the hair was gathered or\r\nwound. The workmanship of this head is unsurpassed by any specimen\r\nof ancient American art which has fallen under the notice of the\r\nauthors, not excepting the best productions of Mexico and Peru. The\r\nwhole is smooth and well polished.\r\n\r\nThese heads are valuable as being the only ones taken from the\r\nmounds, the ancient date of which is clearly established. In the same\r\nmounds in which they were found, it has already been observed, were\r\nalso found upwards of a hundred miniature sculptures of animals,\r\nmost of which are indigenous. The fidelity to nature observed in the\r\nlatter fully warrant us in believing that the sculptures of the human\r\nheads discovered with them are also faithful copies from nature, and\r\ntruly display not only the characteristic features of the ancient\r\nrace, but also their method of wearing the hair, the style of their\r\nhead-dresses, and the character and mode of adjustment of a portion\r\nof their ornaments. This conclusion will appear the more reasonable,\r\nwhen we come to observe the exactness displayed in the effigies of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to overlook the coincidence between the fillet\r\nof «real» pearls displayed upon the forehead of the head first\r\ndescribed, and the similar range of sculptured pearls upon the brow\r\nof the small statue described by Humboldt, and denominated by him the\r\n“statue of an Aztec priestess.”[159] The manner of its adjustment\r\nis in both instances substantially the same, and indicates a common\r\nmode of wearing those ornaments among both the mound-builders and\r\nthe Mexicans. The markings upon the faces of two of these sculptures\r\nmay be taken as representing paint lines or some description of\r\ntattooing. We know that, among the North American tribes, the custom\r\nof painting the face with every variety of color, and ornamenting\r\nit with fantastic figures, was wide-spread and common. The singular\r\nhead-dresses observed in these figures bear little resemblance to\r\nthose of the Indians, so far as we know anything of them. The North\r\nAmericans usually allowed but a single tuft of hair to grow, which\r\ndepended from the centre of the scalp; the hair of the women was\r\nallowed to fall loosely upon the shoulders, or was simply clubbed\r\nbehind. Plumes of feathers, or the dried skins of the heads of\r\ncertain animals, constituted about their only style of head-dress.\r\nThat the practice of wearing rings and pendants in the ears existed\r\namong the race of the mounds may be inferred no less from these\r\nrelics than from the character of some of the ornaments which have\r\nbeen occasionally discovered. The practice was almost universal among\r\nthe hunter tribes and the Central American nations.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the physiological characteristics exhibited by these\r\nrelics, it need only be observed that they do not differ essentially\r\nfrom those of the great [p247] American family, the type of which\r\nseems to have been radically the same through the extent of the\r\ncontinent, excluding, perhaps, a few of the tribes at the extremes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.]\r\n\r\nFig. 146 is carved from a light-colored sandstone, and represents a\r\nhuman figure resting upon its knees and elbows, the soles of the feet\r\nand the palms of the hands being placed together. It is also adapted\r\nas a pipe. It has a singular, painful expression of countenance. A\r\ndouble set of converging lines start from the eye upon the right side\r\nof the face and extend diagonally across it. Upon the left side is a\r\nsingle set terminating in a point near the ear. This figure is boldly\r\nbut not delicately carved, and was found while digging a mill race,\r\nthree feet below the surface, on the west bank of the Miami river,\r\nnear the village of Tippecanoe, Miami county, Ohio.[160] It measures\r\nsix inches in length by about the same height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.]\r\n\r\nFig. 147 is a fine specimen of ancient sculpture. It was found within\r\nan ancient enclosure twelve miles below the city of Chillicothe, and,\r\nfrom the material and style of workmanship, may be regarded as a\r\nrelic of the mound-builders. The [p248] material is a fine porphyry\r\nof a greenish brown or lead-colored ground, interspersed with black\r\nand white granules of a harder nature, and is identical with the\r\nmaterial composing many similar articles taken from the mounds. It\r\nhas the body of a bird with the head of a man, and is delicately\r\nand symmetrically carved. It is adapted as a pipe; the bowl rising\r\nfrom the centre of the back communicates with a hole drilled for the\r\ninsertion of a stem from the side. The attitude of the entire figure\r\nis graceful, and the proportions of the different parts in admirable\r\nharmony. The face displays less individuality than those already\r\nnoticed, and is distinguished for its greater width. The eyes are\r\nclosed, and the general expression, especially of the profile, is\r\nthat of repose. The ears have been mutilated, but display the usual\r\nmarks of perforation. There is no head-dress distinguishable; but\r\nthere is a longitudinal band extending from the back of the head to\r\nthe body of the figure, the purpose of which is not obvious, unless\r\ndesigned to strengthen the attachment of the parts. The wings are\r\nclosely folded, and a waving line runs along the centre. It measures\r\nfive inches in extreme length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.]\r\n\r\nFig. 148 very closely resembles Fig. 146, above described. The\r\nposture is the same, but the limbs are barely indicated. The head\r\nhowever is better carved and is more characteristic. It will be\r\nobserved that it is also distinguished by a line bounding the face,\r\nand has similar markings extending from the eyes. A large serpent is\r\nfolded around the neck, the head and tail resting together upon the\r\nbreast of the figure. The head is surmounted by a knot, resembling\r\nthe scalp lock of the Indians. It is carved from a compact red\r\nsandstone, and is six inches in greatest length by five inches in\r\nheight, with a broad flat base. It was found on the banks of Paint\r\ncreek, one mile distant from the city of Chillicothe. It is also\r\nadapted as a pipe. Several other articles, closely resembling these\r\ntwo, have been found at various points on the surface, but none have\r\nbeen taken from the mounds. Both in the character of their material\r\nand style of workmanship they sustain a close relationship to certain\r\n“stone idols,” as they [p249] have been termed, found, for the\r\nmost part, in the States of Tennessee and Mississippi. One of these\r\n“idols” was discovered some years since, in ploughing upon the Grave\r\ncreek Flats in Virginia.[161] It represents a human figure in a\r\nsquatting attitude, with its elbows drawn back and its hands resting\r\nupon its knees. It is thirteen inches high by six inches and a half\r\nbroad. In material and workmanship it is identical with the articles\r\nlast described, and, like Fig. 148, is distinguished by a crown-tuft\r\nor “scalp-lock.” There are two orifices communicating with each other\r\nin its back. It was probably designed to serve as a pipe. A stone\r\n“idol,” destitute however of orifices, was found not long since near\r\nthe mouth of the Scioto river. It represents a human figure in a\r\nsquatting attitude, the arms clasped around the knees, upon which the\r\nchin is resting. This is the common position of the North American\r\nIndians, when seated around the fires in their wigwams. It seems most\r\nlikely that these rough sculptures have a comparatively recent date,\r\nand are the remains of the tribes found in possession of the country\r\nby the whites. As works of art they are immeasurably inferior to the\r\nrelics from the mounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.]\r\n\r\nFig. 149. This singular specimen of sculpture bears a close\r\nresemblance to those above described, but is of much superior\r\nworkmanship. The features and style of ornament are peculiar. The\r\nmaterial is a gray sandstone. It is now deposited in the museum of\r\nthe Historical Society of New York; but its history is unknown. It\r\nis clearly the original from which the drawing published by Baron\r\n[p250] Humboldt was made. This drawing was copied by Choris, in his\r\n“«Voyage Pittoresque»,” where it is described as having been found\r\nin an ancient tumulus in the State of Connecticut, and presented\r\nto Baron Humboldt by Baron Hyde de Neuville, French ambassador to\r\nRio Janeiro. There must, of course, be some mistake as to the place\r\nof its discovery; for there are no ancient tumuli in the State of\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.]\r\n\r\nFig. 150 is a mask of the human face roughly carved from sandstone.\r\nIt is twelve inches long, seven and a half broad at the ears, and\r\nweighs nearly nine pounds. It is slightly concave upon the back, the\r\nfront being proportionally convex. There is a hole underneath the\r\nchin, as if the object had been designed to be carried upon the point\r\nof a staff. It was found, in ploughing, near Lawrenceburgh in the\r\nState of Indiana.[162]\r\n\r\nSimilar relics, some of which vary little from the above in size, are\r\nfound in Mexico. They are said to occur in the ancient Aztec tombs,\r\ncovering the faces of skeletons. Many of these are sculptured from\r\n«obsidian», and are smooth and beautifully polished; others are of\r\nserpentine and a variety of ornamental stones.[163] [p251]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 151 and 152, are front and profile views of a relic found in\r\nBelmont county, Ohio, nearly opposite Wheeling, on the Ohio river.\r\nThe original is six inches length. It is composed of sandstone. The\r\nback is deeply grooved, but it exhibits no marks of having ever been\r\nattached to any object.\r\n\r\nSCULPTURES OF ANIMALS.—Sculptured figures of a considerable number of\r\nanimals have been found in the mounds, including the lamantin, the\r\nbeaver, otter, elk, bear, wolf, panther, wild cat, raccoon, oppossum,\r\nand squirrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.]\r\n\r\nFig. 153. «The Lamantin, Manitus, or Sea-cow» is not found in this\r\nlatitude, but is peculiar to tropical regions. Seven sculptured\r\nrepresentations of this animal have been taken from the mounds,\r\nof which three are nearly perfect. When first discovered, it was\r\nsupposed they were monstrous creations of fancy; but subsequent\r\ninvestigation and comparison have shown that they are faithful\r\nrepresentations of one of the most singular animal productions of the\r\nworld. Naturalists assume to know but little of the lamantin, beyond\r\nits form and general characteristics. Its habits are involved in much\r\nobscurity. It is thus described by Godman:\r\n\r\n“The general figure of the lamantin is rather elliptical and\r\nelongated. Its head is shaped like a simple truncated cone, and\r\nterminates in a thick fleshy snout, semi-circular at its extremity,\r\nand pierced at the upper part by two small semi-lunar [p252]\r\nnostrils directed forwards. The edge of the upper lip is tumid,\r\nfurrowed in the middle, and provided with thick and stiff whiskers.\r\nThe lower lip is narrower and shorter than the upper, and the opening\r\nof the mouth is small. The eyes are situated towards the upper part\r\nof the head, at the same distance from the snout as the angle of the\r\nlips. The ears are very small, scarcely perceptible, and placed at\r\nthe same distance from the eyes that the latter are from the snout.\r\n\r\n“The neck is not distinguished by any diminution or difference in\r\nsize from the head and trunk, and the latter does not diminish except\r\nfrom the umbilicus, whence it rapidly decreases until it spreads out\r\nand becomes flattened, with a broad, thin, and seemingly truncated\r\nextremity. The tail forms about a fourth of the length of the animal.\r\n\r\n“The arm-bones which sustain the fins are more separated from\r\nthe body than those of the delphinus, and have digits more\r\ndistinguishable through the integuments. The edges of the fin have\r\nfour flat and rounded nails, which do not extend beyond the membrane,\r\nthe nail of the thumb being deficient. The skin is of a gray color,\r\nis slightly shagreened, and has upon it a few scattered hairs, which\r\nare more numerous than elsewhere about the angles of the lips and the\r\npalmar surface of the fins.\r\n\r\n“The full-grown lamantin is from fifteen to twenty feet in length, by\r\neight in circumference, and weighs several thousand pounds.”[164]\r\n\r\n“Head not distinct from the body; eyes very small; tongue oval;\r\nvestiges of nails on the margin of the pectoral fins; six cervical\r\nvertebræ; sixteen pair of thick ribs; «moustaches composed of a\r\nbundle of very strong hairs directed downwards and forming on each\r\nside a kind of corneous tusk».”[165]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.]\r\n\r\nThese external features are faithfully and minutely exhibited in the\r\nsculptures from the mounds. The truncated head, small and scarcely\r\ndistinguishable ears, thick, semi-circular snout, peculiar nostrils,\r\ntumid, furrowed upper lip, singular feet or fins, and remarkable\r\nmoustaches, are all distinctly marked, and render the recognition\r\nof the animal complete. Only one of the sculptures exhibits a flat,\r\ntruncated tail; the others are round. There is however a variety of\r\nthe lamantin [p253] («Manitus» «Senigalensis», DESM.) which has a\r\nround tail, and is distinguished as the “round-tailed manitus.” It is\r\nsmaller in size than the other variety.\r\n\r\nThe name of «Manati» was given to this animal by the Spaniards in\r\nconsequence of the short anterior extremities, which were regarded\r\nas hands. It has been found difficult to assign a place to it in\r\nthe animal creation, and it has been remarked that it “may be\r\nindiscriminately called the last of beasts or the first of fishes.”\r\nIt has two pectoral or abdominal mammæ, which from their position\r\nprobably gave rise among mariners to the fable of the mermaid.\r\nColumbus, when he first saw these animals in the West Indies, called\r\nthem «sirens». They bring forth two young ones at a birth; in defence\r\nof which the manitus, though a peaceable and harmless animal, is\r\ninsensible to pain or fear. Its habits are little understood. It is\r\nsupposed never to leave the water, but frequents the shores to feed\r\non the grass at the edge. Sea-grass or fucus and marine herbage are\r\nsupposed to constitute its principal if not its only food; though\r\nthis is a point upon which naturalists have not ventured to give\r\na decision. The opinion, however, seems general, that it is an\r\nherbivorous animal.\r\n\r\nAs before observed, the manitus is found only in tropical waters,\r\nfrequenting the mouths of rivers, but sometimes ascending them to\r\ngreat distances. They were seen by Humboldt in the Rio Meta, a branch\r\nof the Orinoco, one thousand miles above its mouth; and it is said\r\nthey are found in the Amazon two thousand miles from the sea. They\r\nare also found among the Antilles on the southern coast of Mexico,\r\nand on the coast and in the rivers of Florida, in the United States.\r\nExcepting upon that peninsula, we have no account of their occurrence\r\non our coasts. Bartram mentions a singular spring, a few miles below\r\nTallahassee, Florida, which was frequented by the manitus; and its\r\nbones are found, and occasional living specimens observed, in the\r\nManitee river, which enters Tampa bay.[166]\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this animal was used by the Indians for food, and its\r\nbones and thick tough hide employed in various manufactures. It was\r\nhunted for these purposes; and Oviedo, who seems to have been the\r\nfirst author who noticed it, gives a particular account of the manner\r\nin which it was captured. Bartram observes:\r\n\r\n“The basin and stream were continually peopled with prodigious\r\nnumbers and varieties of fish and other animals, such as the\r\nalligator, and, in the winter season, the manate or sea-cow. Parts\r\nof the skeleton of one which the Indians had killed last winter, lay\r\nupon the banks of the spring; the grinding teeth were about an inch\r\nin diameter, the ribs eighteen inches long and two and a half inches\r\nin thickness, bending with a gentle curve. This bone is esteemed\r\nequal to ivory. The flesh of this creature is counted wholesome and\r\npleasant food; the Indians call them by a name which signifies ‘the\r\nbig beaver.’ My companion, who was a trader, saw three of them at\r\none time near this spring; they feed chiefly on aquatic grass and\r\nweeds.”[167] [p254]\r\n\r\nHumboldt mentions a branch of the Apures river, itself a tributary\r\nof the Orinoco, “called the «Cano del Manati», from the great number\r\nof manatees caught there.” He states that their flesh is savory,\r\nresembling pork, and was in great request among the Indians during\r\nLent, being classed by the monks among fishes. The fat was used in\r\nthe lamps of the churches, and the hide cut into slips to supply the\r\nplace of cordage.[168]\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this animal furnished formerly a large part of the\r\nsubsistence of the inhabitants of St. Christophers, Guadaloupe,\r\nand Martinique. The fat was used at a late day for many of the\r\npurposes to which lard is applied, sometimes supplying the place of\r\nbutter.[169]\r\n\r\nThe sculptures of this animal are in the same style and of like\r\nmaterial with the others found in the mounds. One of them is of\r\na red porphyry, filled with small white and light blue granules;\r\nthe remainder are of sandstone, limestone, etc. Most of the mound\r\nsculptures are from these materials.\r\n\r\nThese singular relics have been thus minutely noticed, inasmuch as\r\nthey have a direct bearing upon some of the questions connected\r\nwith the origin of the mounds. That we find marine shells or\r\narticles composed from them, in the mounds, is not so much a matter\r\nof surprise, when we reflect that a sort of exchange was carried\r\non even by the unsympathizing American tribes, and that articles\r\nfrom the mouth of the Columbia are known to have found their way,\r\nby a system of transfer, to the banks of the Mississippi; their\r\noccurrence does not necessarily establish anything more, than that\r\nan intercourse of some kind was kept up between the builders of\r\nthe mounds on the banks of the Ohio, and the sea.[170] There is,\r\nhowever, something more involved in the discovery of these relics.\r\nThey are undistinguishable, so far as material and workmanship are\r\nconcerned, from an entire class of remains found in the mounds; and\r\nare evidently the work of the same hands with the other effigies of\r\nbeasts and birds. And yet they faithfully represent animals found,\r\n(and only in small numbers,) a thousand miles distant, upon the\r\nshores of Florida. Either the same race, possessing throughout a like\r\nstyle of workmanship, and deriving their materials from a common\r\nsource, existed contemporaneously over the whole range of intervening\r\nterritory, and maintained a constant intercommunication; or else\r\nthere was at some period a migration from the south, bringing with\r\nit characteristic remains of the land from which it emanated. The\r\nsculptures of the manitus are too exact to have been the production\r\nof those who were not well acquainted with the animal and its habits.\r\n[p255]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.]\r\n\r\n[p257]\r\n\r\nFig. 155. THE BEAVER.—Three sculptures of the beaver have been\r\nobtained from the mounds,—all in the characteristic attitudes of that\r\nanimal. The engraving does not do justice to the original, which is\r\nbetter proportioned. These animals were frequent in the North-western\r\nStates, but have now almost entirely disappeared. The large head,\r\nblunt snout, small ears and eyes, peculiar claws, and broad, oval,\r\nscaly tail, are all well characterized in the sculptures.\r\n\r\nTHE OTTER.—Two sculptures of the otter have been discovered, one\r\nof which represents the animal grasping a fish in its mouth; it is\r\nhowever much mutilated. That of which an imperfect engraving (Fig.\r\n157) is given is composed of the peculiar porphyry already described,\r\nand displays in a striking manner the features of the animal. The\r\nflattened head, small mouth, almost imperceptible ears, rounded body,\r\nand short but strong and fin-like legs, no less than the attitude\r\nof the figure, enable us to recognise at once the most active,\r\ncourageous, and voracious of the indigenous amphibious animals.\r\nThe otter is still found, in limited numbers, about the waters of\r\nthe North-western States. The eyes in this specimen were formed by\r\ndrilling a narrow but deep hole, which was filled with a material\r\nof different color, resembling bone. In many instances small pearls\r\nwere inserted for eyes, some of which have been found retaining their\r\nplaces, unreduced by the fire to which they have been exposed. This\r\nrelic, in common with all the mound sculptures, is delicately carved\r\nand polished.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD CAT.—Figs. 158, 159, 160. Of this animal and others of the\r\nsame genus a large number of sculptures have been obtained. One\r\nof these represents the female animal erect; the remainder are in\r\ncharacteristic positions. They are very minutely sculptured, the\r\nwhiskers and variegated color of the hair around the head, as well\r\nas the general features of the animal,—strong jaws, short neck,\r\nand short thick tail,—are all well exhibited. Fig. 160 presents a\r\nhead slightly different from most of the others. It bears a close\r\nresemblance to that of the cougar. Most of these are exquisitely\r\ncarved from a red, granulated porphyry, of exceeding hardness,—so\r\nhard, indeed, as to turn the edge of the best tempered knife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.]\r\n\r\nFig. 161 is a very spirited representation of the head of the elk,\r\nalthough it is not minutely accurate. [p258]\r\n\r\nNumerous other illustrations of these miniatures might be introduced;\r\nthe above will, however, convey a very clear notion of the character\r\nof the sculptures and the fidelity of the representations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.]\r\n\r\nFig. 162 is a fragment of a large and elaborately carved pipe\r\nrepresenting the head of some animal. It is composed of the beautiful\r\nmicaceous stone already several times noticed, and in respect of size\r\nis unlike any of the articles of this description which have been\r\ntaken from the mounds. The circular striæ left by the instrument\r\nused in boring the tube are distinctly marked. At the termination of\r\nthe bore, is what is technically termed “the «core»,” showing that\r\nthe drilling had been effected by some hollow instrument, probably\r\na thin stem of cane. The cane is used at this day by the Indians\r\nfor drilling, and with the aid of fine sand and water forms a very\r\nefficient instrument. It is probable that all the tubes, large and\r\nsmall, found in the mounds, were produced in this manner. This\r\nfragment of sculpture is nine inches long. The bowl was evidently\r\ncarved in the form of some animal, but it is too much broken to be\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.]\r\n\r\nFig. 163 is one of the most delicate specimens of ancient workmanship\r\nthus far discovered. It is of the same material with the article last\r\nnoticed, and like that has the form of an animal’s head. What animal\r\nit was intended to represent, it is not easy to determine; in the\r\nlength of its ears it resembles the rabbit. A portion of the point of\r\nthe nose is broken off. It is hollowed like a canoe upon the under\r\nside, leaving but a thin shell of material, not exceeding, for the\r\nmost part, the tenth of an inch in thickness. It is perforated with\r\nsmall holes at the root of each ear, and has a hole, drilled from the\r\ninterior, in the crown. It is impossible to conjecture the purpose\r\nto which this article was applied, unless that of ornament. It is\r\nelegantly and symmetrically carved, and highly polished.\r\n\r\nSCULPTURES OF BIRDS.—The sculptures of birds are much more numerous\r\nthan those of animals, and comprise between thirty and forty\r\ndifferent kinds, and not [p259] far from one hundred specimens. We\r\nrecognise the eagle, hawk, heron, owl, buzzard, toucan (?), raven,\r\nswallow, parroquet, duck, grouse, and numerous other land and water\r\nbirds. There are several varieties of the same species; for instance,\r\namong the owls, we find the great owl, the horned owl, and the little\r\nowl; there are also several varieties of the rapacious birds. It is\r\nimpossible to present examples of all these. The following specimens\r\nwill, however, serve amply to illustrate the strict fidelity to\r\nnature which the sculptures display, as also the skill with which\r\nthey are executed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.]\r\n\r\nFig. 164 will readily be recognised as the tufted heron, the most\r\nindefatigable and voracious of all the fisher varieties. The small\r\nbody; long wings, extending to the extremity of the short tail;\r\nlong, thin neck; sharp bill, and tufted head, are unmistakeable\r\nfeatures. He is represented in the attitude of striking a fish, which\r\nis also faithfully executed. Nothing can surpass the truthfulness\r\nand delicacy of the sculpture. The minutest features are shown; the\r\narticulations of the legs of the bird, as also the gills, fins, and\r\nscales of the fish, are represented. It is carved from the red,\r\nspeckled porphyry, already several times mentioned as constituting\r\nthe material of many of these sculptures. As a work of art it is\r\nincomparably superior to any remains of the existing tribes of\r\nIndians. The engraving, in point of spirit, falls far short of the\r\noriginal. [p260]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.]\r\n\r\nFig. 165 represents a rapacious bird, probably some variety of\r\nthe eagle or hawk, in the attitude of tearing in pieces a small\r\nbird, which it grasps in its claws. The sculpture is spirited and\r\nlife-like, as well as minute and delicate. The wings are folded\r\nacross each other; and the finer feathers upon their superior\r\nportions, and upon the thighs, are well represented. The eyes of this\r\nbird were composed of small pearls, inserted about half their depth\r\nin the stone. Pearls seem to have constituted the eyes of nearly all\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nFig. 166. This fragment also represents some variety of rapacious\r\nbird. It is wrought with admirable skill and spirit, and it is to be\r\nregretted that the entire figure was not recovered.\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOW.—Fig. 167. This fine specimen cannot be too much admired\r\nfor its fidelity to nature and its excellent finish. The body is\r\nthrown forward, and the wings are apparently about to be expanded,\r\nas if the bird was just ready to dash off on its swift and erratic\r\nflight. This attitude will readily be recognised as eminently\r\ncharacteristic, by those who have watched the graceful movements\r\nof this active, cheerful bird. The engraving fails to convey the\r\nlightness and spirit of the original, which, it should be mentioned,\r\nis carved in red porphyry.\r\n\r\nSUMMER or WOOD DUCK.—Fig. 168. This bird is common throughout the\r\nUnited States. The head is well characterized, and is admirably\r\nexecuted. The engraving conveys but an imperfect notion of the\r\noriginal, which is lighter and of better proportions.\r\n\r\nTHE TOUCAN. (?)—Fig. 169. The engraving very well represents the\r\noriginal, which is delicately carved from a compact limestone. It is\r\nsupposed to represent the toucan,—a tropical bird, and one not known\r\nto exist anywhere within the limits of the United States. If we are\r\nnot mistaken in supposing it to represent this bird, the remarks made\r\nrespecting the sculptures of the manitus will here apply with double\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nFig. 170. This specimen will readily be recognised as intended to\r\nrepresent the head of the grouse. It is exceedingly spirited, and\r\nin execution is inferior to none of the articles recovered from the\r\nmounds. Birds of this species, though not abundant in the Scioto\r\nvalley, are plentiful on the plains of Indiana and Illinois. The\r\nmaterial is the red granulated porphyry so often mentioned.\r\n\r\nFig. 171. This specimen, which is well exhibited in the engraving,\r\nis carved from a compact limestone. It was probably intended to\r\nrepresent the turkey-buzzard. This bird is common in southern Ohio.\r\n[p261]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.]\r\n\r\n[p264]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.]\r\n\r\n[p265]\r\n\r\nTHE PARROQUET.—Fig. 172. Among the most spirited and delicately\r\nexecuted specimens of ancient art found in the mounds, is that of the\r\nparroquet here presented. The fragment shown in the cut was alone\r\nrecovered. The engraving, though very good, fails to do justice to\r\nthe original. The parroquet is essentially a southern bird; and,\r\nthough common along the Gulf, is of rare occurrence above the Ohio\r\nriver. It is sometimes seen in the Scioto valley, fifty miles above\r\nits mouth.\r\n\r\nFig. 173. The bird here represented much resembles the tufted “cherry\r\nbird.” The head is somewhat disproportioned to the body,—a defect\r\nmore common than any other in the mound sculptures. It is carved from\r\na brown, granulated porphyry, and is finished with great delicacy.\r\nThe bowl is ingeniously enlarged, below the opening, so as to admit a\r\ngreater quantity of tobacco, or whatever article was smoked, without\r\ninterfering with the symmetry of the bird, which a larger bore would\r\nhave much impaired.\r\n\r\nFig. 174. This specimen does not differ widely from that shown in\r\nthe preceding figure, and was probably intended to represent the\r\nsame bird. The too great size of the head observed in the other is\r\nnot so marked in this instance. The material somewhat resembles, in\r\ncolor and substance, the red pipe-stone of the «Coteau des Prairies»,\r\nbut has less of the talcose appearance and feel. It receives a very\r\ngood finish, but is not susceptible of a high polish. The pearls\r\nwhich had been inserted in the cavities representing the eyes, were\r\nin this instance found retaining their places. They had lost their\r\nbrilliancy in consequence of exposure to the fire, but were yet\r\neasily recognisable.\r\n\r\nFig. 175. The remarks made in respect to the relic last mentioned\r\napply to the specimen here represented. It is carved in the same\r\nmaterial as Fig. 173, and is probably intended to represent a bird of\r\nthe same variety. Nothing can exceed the life-like expression of the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nFig. 176. This specimen seems unfinished, and the features of the\r\nbird sought to be represented are not well made out. It seems to have\r\nbeen rubbed or ground into its present shape, and is yet unpolished.\r\n\r\nFig. 177. This is one of the least tasteful specimens recovered\r\nfrom the mounds, and, like the one last noticed, seems to be in an\r\nunfinished state. The lines indicated in the cut are sharply graved\r\nin the stone. It is not undertaken to say what bird is designed to be\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nFig. 178. This carving is roughly executed, and represents a bird of\r\nsome variety not easily recognisable. The bill is broad and heavy,\r\nand the toes are long and wide-spread. It is evidently intended to\r\nrepresent a bird in the act of picking up some articles of food,\r\nwhich are indicated by small circles on the palm of an extended hand.\r\nOn account of the convexity of the base of the pipe, these [p266]\r\ndetails are not shown in the engraving, which in all other respects\r\nis a faithful copy of the original.\r\n\r\nFrom the size of its bill, and the circumstance of its having two\r\ntoes before and two behind, the bird intended to be represented would\r\nseem to belong to the zygodactylous order—probably the toucan. The\r\ntoucan («Ramphastos» of Lin.) is found on this continent only in the\r\ntropical countries of South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.]\r\n\r\nPozzo, a distinguished naturalist, speaks of taming them very\r\neasily. Other travellers inform us that they are very highly prized\r\nby the Indians of Guiana and Brazil, principally on account of\r\ntheir brilliant plumage. They pluck off the skin from the breast,\r\ncontaining the most beautiful feathers, and glue it upon their cheeks\r\nby way of ornament. In those districts the toucan was almost the only\r\nbird the aborigines attempted to domesticate. The fact that it is\r\nrepresented receiving its food from a human hand, would, under these\r\ncircumstances, favor the conclusion that the sculpture was designed\r\nto represent the toucan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.]\r\n\r\nFig. 179. This characteristic specimen is carved in limestone, and\r\nis well finished in every respect. It is uncertain what bird it is\r\nintended to represent. At the tail are two holes, evidently designed\r\nfor the insertion of feathers or other ornaments.\r\n\r\nFig. 180. A great variety of fragments have been taken from the\r\nmounds, which it has been found impossible to match with others,\r\nso as to complete the [p267] originals. This is the more to be\r\nregretted, from the fact that many of them denote a degree of skill\r\nequalling, if not surpassing, that displayed in the most complete\r\nspecimens. The two heads here presented, probably intended to\r\nrepresent the eagle, are far superior in point of finish, spirit, and\r\ntruthfulness, to any miniature carvings, ancient or modern, which\r\nhave fallen under the notice of the authors. The engravings, though\r\nvery accurate and spirited, still fail to do full justice to the\r\noriginals. The peculiar defiant expression of the “king of birds” is\r\nadmirably preserved in the carvings, which in this respect more than\r\nany other display the skill of the ancient artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.]\r\n\r\nFig. 181. This engraving, which is half the size of the original, is\r\nintroduced simply to illustrate the great variety of devices adopted\r\nby the mound-builders in the construction of their pipes. A number\r\nvery much resembling the one here figured, have been recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.]\r\n\r\nFig. 182. This specimen is unfinished, and plainly exhibits the\r\nprocess adopted by the ancient artist in bringing it to its present\r\nstate. None of the more minute details have as yet received any\r\nattention. The base and various parts of the figure exhibit fine\r\nstriæ, resulting from rubbing or grinding; but the general outline\r\nseems to have been secured by cutting with some sharp instrument,\r\nthe marks [p268] of which are plainly to be seen, especially at the\r\nparts where it would be difficult or impracticable to approach with\r\na triturating substance. The lines indicating the feathers, grooves\r\nof the beak, and other more delicate features, are cut or graved in\r\nthe surface at a single stroke. Some pointed tool seems to have been\r\nused, and the marks are visible where it has occasionally slipped\r\nbeyond the control of the engraver. Indeed, the whole appearance\r\nof the specimen indicates that the work was done rapidly by an\r\nexperienced hand, and that the various parts were brought forward\r\nsimultaneously. The freedom of the strokes could only result from\r\nlong practice; and we may infer that the manufacture of pipes had a\r\ndistinct place in the industrial organization of the mound-builders.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS SCULPTURES.—Sculptures of serpents, turtles, frogs, and\r\nother animals, have been discovered in abundance; all displaying a\r\nlike faithful observance of nature.\r\n\r\nFigs. 183 and 184. These sculptures of the toad are very truthful.\r\nThe knotted, corrugated skin is well represented in one of them;\r\nwhich, if placed in the grass before an unsuspecting observer,\r\nwould probably be mistaken for the natural object. Fig. 184 is in\r\nan unfinished state. It very well exhibits the mode of workmanship;\r\nwhile the general surface appears covered with striæ running in every\r\ndirection, as if produced by rubbing. The folds and lines are clearly\r\n«cut» with some sort of graver. The marks of the implement «chipping»\r\nout portions a fourth of an inch in length, are too distinct to admit\r\nthe slightest doubt that a cutting tool was used in the work. Those\r\nwho deem expression in sculpture the grand essential, will find\r\nsomething to amuse as well as to admire in the lugubrious expression\r\nof the mouths of these specimens.\r\n\r\nTHE FROG.—Fig. 185. A large number of sculptures of the frog have\r\nbeen discovered; most, however, are much broken up by fire. This\r\nspecimen is carved in white limestone.\r\n\r\nFig. 186 certainly represents the rattle-snake. Other sculptures of\r\nthe serpent, coiled in like manner around the bowls of pipes, have\r\nbeen found. One represents a variety not recognised. It has a broad,\r\nflat head, and the body is singularly marked. All are carved in\r\nporphyry. Two sculptures of the alligator have also been found, but\r\nmuch broken up by the fire.\r\n\r\nFigs. 187 and 188. Two views of a sculptured stone, representing,\r\nprobably, the head of a goose; upon the back is carved a death’s\r\nhead. It is composed of a hard, black stone, and measures three and\r\na half inches in length by two and a half in height. Found near\r\nBrookville, Indiana. [p269]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.]\r\n\r\n[p271]\r\n\r\nFigs. 189 and 190. These are fragments of sculptures, of which it was\r\nfound impossible to collect the various pieces. Fig. 189 is supposed\r\nto represent the head of the bear; Fig. 190 the head of the wolf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.]\r\n\r\nFig. 191. This is a reduced copy of a curious carving, representing\r\nsome animal. Whether it is a “fancy piece,” or whether the original\r\ncounterpart exists in nature, it is not assumed to say.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.]\r\n\r\nFig. 192. The remark last made holds good respecting this singular\r\nsculpture. It has been supposed to represent the head and shoulders\r\nof the morse. [p272]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.]\r\n\r\nFig. 193. This is probably a rude representation of the head of\r\nsome kind of toad or frog. It is boldly cut, evidently with little\r\nattention to nature, and is chiefly interesting as illustrating the\r\ngreat variety of figures which these relics assume.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general character of the sculptures found in the mounds.\r\nIt is unnecessary to say more than that as works of art, they are\r\nimmeasurably beyond anything which the North American Indians are\r\nknown to produce, even at this day, with all the suggestions of\r\nEuropean art and the advantages afforded by steel instruments. The\r\nChinooks, and the Indians of the North-western Coast, carve pipes,\r\nplatters, and other articles, with much neatness, from slate. We see\r\nin their pipes, for instance, a heterogeneous collection of pulleys,\r\ncords, barrels, and rude human figures, evidently suggested by the\r\ntackling of the ships trading in those seas. Their platters, too, are\r\ncopies of English ware, differing only in material and ornaments.\r\nThe utmost that can be said of them is, that they are elaborate,\r\nunmeaning carvings, displaying some degree of ingenuity. A much\r\nhigher rank can be claimed for the mound-sculptures; they combine\r\ntaste in arrangement with skill in workmanship, and are faithful\r\ncopies, not distorted caricatures, from nature. They display not only\r\nthe figures and the characteristic attitudes, but in some cases, as\r\nwe have seen, the very habits of the objects represented. So far as\r\nfidelity is concerned, many of them deserve to rank by the side of\r\nthe best efforts of the artist-naturalists of our own day.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans and Peruvians were very skilful in their representations\r\nof animals, and the early historians are profuse in praise of their\r\nworkmanship, extolling it beyond that of the old world. Says La Vega\r\nof the Peruvians:\r\n\r\n“They fashioned likewise all beasts and birds in gold and silver;\r\nnamely, conies, rats, lizards, serpents, butterflies, foxes, mountain\r\ncats (for they have no tame cats in their houses); and they make\r\nsparrows and all sorts of lesser birds, some flying, some perching in\r\ntrees; in short, no creature that was either wild or domestic, but\r\nwas made and represented by them according to its exact and natural\r\nshape.”[171]\r\n\r\nClavigero says of the exceeding skill of the Mexicans in the arts,\r\nthat their works “were so admirably finished, that even the Spanish\r\nsoldiers, all stung with the same wretched thirst for gold, valued\r\nthe «workmanship» more than the materials.” And Peter Martyr,\r\nnoticing the works of the people along the coasts of the Caribbean\r\nsea and the Gulf of Mexico, exclaims,—“If man’s art or invention ever\r\ngot any honor in such like arts, these people may claim the chief\r\nsovereignty and commendation.”[172]\r\n\r\nThe method practised by the makers of the articles above mentioned,\r\nin reducing them to shape, seems to have been the very obvious\r\none resorted to by all rude nations unacquainted with the use of\r\niron; namely, that of rubbing or grinding upon stones possessing\r\na sharp grit. The Mexicans, it is said, used tools of obsidian in\r\ntheir sculptures; and the Peruvians, although possessing implements\r\nof [p273] hardened copper, according to La Vega, “rather wore\r\nout the stone by continued rubbing, than cutting.” Most of the\r\nmound-sculptures have been so carefully smoothed and are so highly\r\npolished, as to show few marks of rubbing; but some have been found,\r\nas has already been shown, in an unfinished state, which exhibit\r\nfully the mode of workmanship. These show that the makers had also\r\nsharp cutting instruments, which were used in delineating the minor\r\nfeatures. The lines indicating the folds in the skin of animals, and\r\nthe feathers of birds, are not ground in, but «cut», evidently to\r\nthe entire depth, at a single stroke. Sometimes the tool has slipped\r\nby, indicating that it was held and used after the manner of the\r\ngravers of the present day. The time and labor expended in perfecting\r\nthese elaborate works from obstinate materials, with no other than\r\nthese rude aids, must have given them a high value when finished.\r\nHence we find a great deal of ingenuity exhibited in restoring them\r\nwhen accidentally broken. This was accomplished by drilling holes\r\ndiagonally to each other in the detached parts, so that by the\r\ninsertion of wooden pegs or copper wire, they were, in technical\r\nphrase, “bound together.” This attachment was further strengthened,\r\nin some cases, by bands of sheet copper; occasionally the entire\r\npipe, when much injured, seems to have been plated over with that\r\nmetal. When the fracture was such as materially to injure the tube,\r\na small copper tube was inserted within it, restoring an unbroken\r\ncommunication. Many interesting facts of this kind, which perhaps may\r\nseem trivial and unimportant to most minds, might be presented. They\r\nillustrate how highly these remains were valued by their possessors.\r\nThe manner in which the drilling was probably accomplished has\r\nalready been indicated.\r\n\r\nTABLETS.—A few small sculptured tablets have been found in the\r\nmounds. Some of these have been regarded as bearing hieroglyphical,\r\nothers alphabetic inscriptions, and have been made the basis of\r\nmuch speculation at home and abroad. Nothing of this extraordinary\r\ncharacter has been disclosed in the course of the investigations\r\nhere recorded; nor is there any evidence that anything like an\r\nalphabetic or hieroglyphic system existed among the mound-builders.\r\nThe earthworks, and the mounds and their contents, certainly indicate\r\nthat, prior to the occupation of the Mississippi valley by the more\r\nrecent tribes of Indians, there existed here a numerous population,\r\nagricultural in their habits, considerably advanced in the arts, and\r\nundoubtedly, in all respects, much superior to their successors.\r\nThere is, however, no reason to believe that their condition was\r\nanything more than an approximation towards that attained by the\r\nsemi-civilized nations of the central portions of the continent,—who\r\nthemselves had not arrived at the construction of an alphabet.\r\nWhether the latter had progressed further than to a refinement upon\r\nthe rude picture-writing of the savage tribes, is a question open to\r\ndiscussion. It would be unwarrantable therefore to assign to the race\r\nof the mounds a superiority in this respect over nations palpably\r\nso much in advance of them in all others. It would be a reversal\r\nof the teachings of history, an exception to the law of harmonious\r\ndevelopment, which it would require a large assemblage of well\r\nattested facts to sustain. Such an array of facts, it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to add, we do not possess. [p274]\r\n\r\nIt is true, hardly a year passes unsignalized by the announcement\r\nof the discovery of tablets of stone or metal, bearing strange\r\nand mystical inscriptions,—generally reported to have a “marked\r\nresemblance to the Chinese characters.” But they either fail to\r\nwithstand an analysis of the alleged circumstances attending their\r\ndiscovery, or resolve themselves into very simple natural productions\r\nwhen subjected to scientific scrutiny. It will be remembered that\r\nsome years ago it was announced that six inscribed copper plates\r\nhad been found in a mound near Kinderhook, Pike county, Illinois.\r\nEngravings of them and a minute description were published at the\r\ntime, and widely circulated. Subsequent inquiry has shown that the\r\nplates were a harmless imposition, got up for local effect; and that\r\nthe village blacksmith, with no better suggestion to his antiquarian\r\nlabors than the lid of a tea-chest, was chiefly responsible for\r\nthem. Within the past two years an announcement was made of the\r\ndiscovery, in a mound near Lower Sandusky, Ohio, of a series of oval\r\nmica plates, inscribed with numberless unknown characters, which, in\r\nthe language of the printed account, probably “contained the history\r\nof some former race that inhabited this country.” These plates were\r\nfound, upon examination, to be ornaments of that variety of mica\r\nknown as “graphic” or “hieroglyphic mica,”—which is naturally marked\r\nwith figures somewhat regular in their arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Grave creek mound was also said to have contained a small\r\nstone, bearing an alphabetical inscription, which has attracted\r\nthe attention of a number of learned men both in this country and\r\nin Europe. A critical examination of the circumstances attending\r\nthe introduction of this relic to the world is calculated to throw\r\ngreat doubt upon its genuineness. The fact that it is not mentioned\r\nby intelligent observers writing from the spot at the time of the\r\nexcavation of the mound, and that no notice of its existence was made\r\npublic until after the opening of the mound for exhibition, joined to\r\nthe strong presumptive evidence against the occurrence of anything of\r\nthe kind, furnished by the antagonistic character of all the ancient\r\nremains of the continent, so far as they are known,—are insuperable\r\nobjections to its reception. Until it is better authenticated, it\r\nshould be entirely excluded from a place among the antiquities of our\r\ncountry.[173]\r\n\r\nA small tablet was discovered, some years ago, in a mound at\r\nCincinnati, of which Fig. 194 presents a front, and Fig. 195 a\r\nreverse view.\r\n\r\nThis relic is now in the possession of ERASMUS GEST, Esq., of\r\nCincinnati. The circumstances under which it was discovered are thus\r\ndetailed by Mr. Gest in a letter published at the time:\r\n\r\n“I herewith send you what I deem to be a hieroglyphical stone, which\r\nwas found buried with a skeleton in the ‘old mound,’ situated in the\r\nwestern part of the city, together with two pointed bones, each about\r\nseven inches long, taken from the same spot. (See page 220.)\r\n\r\n“In the course of the excavation several skeletons were disinterred;\r\nand their being generally in a good state of preservation and near\r\nthe surface, gave rise to [p275] the inference that they were\r\ndeposited there since the mound was erected: but the one with which\r\nthe sharpened bones and hieroglyphical stone were found, was in a\r\ndecayed state. Being in the centre and rather below the level of\r\nthe surrounding ground, it was no doubt the object over which the\r\nmound was erected. I have a part of the skull; the remainder of the\r\nskeleton was destroyed by the diggers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. From a drawing by H. C. GROSVENOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the skeleton with which it was found, as also the\r\nother circumstances attending the discovery of this relic, leave\r\nlittle doubt as to its authenticity. It was discovered in December,\r\n1841. The material is a fine-grained, compact sandstone, of a light\r\nbrown color. It measures five inches in length, three in breadth at\r\nthe ends, two and six tenths at the middle, and is about half an\r\ninch in thickness. The sculptured face varies very slightly from a\r\nperfect plane. The figures are cut in low relief, (the lines being\r\nnot more than one twentieth of an inch in depth,) and occupy a\r\nrectangular space four inches and two tenths long, by two and one\r\ntenth wide. The sides of the stone, it will be observed, are slightly\r\nconcave. Right lines are drawn across the face near the ends. At\r\nright angles and exterior to these are notches, twenty-five at one\r\nend, and twenty-four at the other. Extending diagonally inward are\r\nfifteen longer lines, eight at one end and seven at the other. The\r\nback of the stone has three deep, longitudinal grooves, and several\r\ndepressions, evidently caused by rubbing,—probably produced in\r\nsharpening the instrument used in the sculpture.\r\n\r\nWithout discussing the “singular resemblance which the relic bears to\r\nthe Egyptian «cartouch»,” it will be sufficient to direct attention\r\nto the reduplication of [p276] the figures, those upon one side\r\ncorresponding with those upon the other, and the two central ones\r\nbeing also alike. It will be observed that there are but three\r\nscrolls or figures, four of one description, and two of each of the\r\nothers. Probably no serious discussion of the question whether or\r\nnot these figures are hieroglyphical is needed. They more resemble\r\nthe stalk and flowers of a plant than anything else in nature.\r\nWhat significance, if any, may attach to the peculiar markings or\r\ngraduations at the ends, it is not undertaken to say. The sum of the\r\nproducts of the longer and shorter lines (24×7+25×8) is 368, three\r\nmore than the number of days in the year; from which circumstance\r\nthe suggestion has been advanced that the tablet had an astronomical\r\norigin, and constituted some sort of a calendar.\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps find the key to its purposes in a very humble but\r\nnot therefore less interesting class of Southern remains. Both in\r\nMexico and in the mounds of Mississippi have been found «stamps» of\r\nburned clay, the faces of which are covered with figures, fanciful or\r\nimitative, all in low relief, like the face of a stereotype plate.\r\nThese were used in impressing ornaments upon the clothes or prepared\r\nskins of the people possessing them. They exhibit the concavity of\r\nthe sides to be observed in the relic in question, intended doubtless\r\nfor greater convenience in holding and using it, as also a similar\r\nreduplication of the ornamental figures,—all betraying a common\r\npurpose. This explanation is offered hypothetically as being entirely\r\nconsistent with the general character of the mound remains; which,\r\ntaken together, do not warrant us in looking for anything that might\r\nnot well pertain to a very simple, not to say rude, people.[174]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.]\r\n\r\nFig. 196. From one of the mounds, numbered 1 in the plan of the great\r\nenclosure on the North Fork of Paint creek, (Plate X,) were taken\r\nseveral singularly sculptured tablets, of one of which the figure\r\nhere presented is a copy, so far as it has been found possible to\r\nrestore it from the several fragments recovered. It represents a\r\ncoiled rattlesnake; both faces of the tablet being identical in\r\n[p277] sculpture, excepting that one is plane, the other slightly\r\nconvex. The material is a very fine cinnamon-colored sandstone,\r\nand the style of the sculpture is identical with that displayed in\r\nthe tablet from the Cincinnati mound already noticed. The original\r\nis six inches and a quarter long, one and three eighths broad, and\r\none quarter of an inch thick. The workmanship is delicate, and the\r\ncharacteristic feature of the rattlesnake perfectly represented. It\r\nis to be regretted that it is impossible to restore the head, which,\r\nso far as it can be made out, has some peculiar and interesting\r\nfeatures,—plumes or ornamental figures surmounting it. Previous to\r\nthe investigation of the mound by the authors, an entire tablet\r\nwas obtained from it by an individual residing near the spot,\r\nwho represents it to have been carefully and closely enveloped\r\nin sheets of copper, which he had great difficulty in removing.\r\nIncited by a miserable curiosity he broke the specimen, to ascertain\r\nits composition; and the larger portion, including the head, was\r\nsubsequently lost. The remaining fragment, from its exceedingly well\r\npreserved condition, confirms the statement of the finder respecting\r\nits envelopment. It seems that several of these tablets were\r\noriginally deposited in the mound; the greater portions of four have\r\nbeen recovered, but none displaying the head entire. The person above\r\nmentioned affirms that the head, in the specimen which he discovered,\r\nwas surrounded by “feathers;” how far this is confirmed by the\r\nfragment, the reader must judge for himself. The tablets seem to have\r\nbeen originally painted of different colors: a dark red pigment is\r\nyet plainly to be seen in the depressions of some of the fragments;\r\nothers had been painted of a dense black color.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear probable that these relics were designed for\r\nornaments. On the contrary, the circumstances under which they were\r\ndiscovered render it likely that they had a superstitious origin, and\r\nwere objects of high regard and perhaps of worship. It has already\r\nbeen observed, in connection with the account of the great serpentine\r\nstructure in Adams county, Ohio, (Plate XXXV,) that the serpent\r\nentered widely into the superstitions of the American nations,\r\nsavage and semi-civilized, and was conspicuous among their symbols\r\nas the emblem of the greatest gods of their mythology, both good and\r\nevil. And wherever it appears, whether among the carvings of the\r\nNatchez (who, according to Charlevoix, placed it upon their altars\r\nas an object of worship), among the paintings of the Aztecs, or upon\r\nthe temples of Central America, it is worthy of remark, that it is\r\ninvariably the «rattlesnake». And as among the Egyptians the «cobra»\r\nwas the sign of royalty, so among the Mexicans the rattlesnake was\r\nan emblem of kingly power and dominion. As such it appears in the\r\ncrown of «Tezcatlipoca», the Brahma of the Aztec pantheon, and in the\r\nhelmets of the warrior priests of that divinity. The «feather-headed\r\nrattlesnake», it should be observed, was in Mexico the peculiar\r\nsymbol of «Tezcatlipoca», otherwise symbolized as the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159] «Researches», vol. i, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[160] In the possession of J.

But the best evidence of\r\nits genuineness is this, that a person in our times could scarcely\r\nmake so perfect an engraving as this stone, and not make it more\r\nperfect, the engraving represents something, whatever it is, the two\r\nsides of which are intended to be alike, and yet no two curves or\r\nlines are precisely alike, nor is there the least evidence of the\r\nuse of our instruments to be discovered in the work. So difficult\r\nis it to imitate with our cultivated hands and eyes the peculiar\r\nimperfection of this cutting, that some excellent judges, who at\r\nfirst doubted the genuineness of the relic, have changed their\r\nopinion upon trying to imitate it. What the sculpture means is\r\nanother matter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p278]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVI.\r\n METALS, MINERALS, FOSSILS, SHELLS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequent allusion has been made, in the preceding pages, to the\r\nnumerous rare and beautiful varieties of minerals, fossils, and\r\nshells, disclosed from the mounds; but no opportunity has been\r\nafforded to speak of them with desirable fulness. The identification,\r\naccurate or approximate, of the localities from whence these\r\nwere obtained, will serve, in a degree, to reflect light upon\r\nthe grand archæological questions of the origin, migration, and\r\nintercommunication of the race of the mounds. In this respect\r\nthey are of value; for, in the investigations here attempted, we\r\nare compelled to press into the work of elucidation, every fact\r\nand circumstance which can, in any way, affect the subject of our\r\ninquiries. The discovery of «obsidian», a purely volcanic production,\r\nin the mounds, in a region entirely destitute of the evidences\r\nof immediate volcanic action, is, to the commonest apprehension,\r\na remarkable fact, a subject of wonder; but neither marvels nor\r\nmysticism have aught to do with science. The fact, to the mind of\r\nthe rational archæologist, is suggestive only of the inquiry, Whence\r\nwas this singular product obtained? Its presence cannot be accounted\r\nfor, in the quantities discovered, except upon the supposition that\r\nit was transported from a distance; which supposition involves, of\r\nnecessity, intercommunication or migration. To measure the bounds of\r\nintercourse, casual or constant, or define the course of migration,\r\nit is necessary to ascertain the exact primitive locality of the\r\nproduct in question. So far as we are informed, the nearest point of\r\nits occurrence is Mexico, the ancient inhabitants of which country\r\napplied it extensively to the very purposes for which it was used by\r\nthe race of the mounds.\r\n\r\nIn this process of investigation, there are many circumstances which\r\nmust come under view and receive due consideration, before we venture\r\nupon the simplest conclusions. They are, however, entirely omitted in\r\nthis connection; the object of the illustration being simply to show\r\nin what general manner facts of this kind may be made subservient,\r\nand of what importance they may become in a system of research, in\r\nwhich we have neither written record nor even the voice of tradition\r\nto give direction to our inquiries.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that it is difficult in every case to detect the\r\ntrue nature of the remains discovered, and often quite impossible\r\nto point out their original localities. Hence the necessity of\r\npresenting a comprehensive view of their extent and character, so\r\nthat other laborers in the field of antiquarian research may be able\r\nto institute comparisons, and indicate localities, and thus gradually\r\nwork out the grand problems involved in our aboriginal history. The\r\nprocess may appear [p279] tedious and intricate, and the results\r\nhardly worth the labor of their development; that is, however, a\r\nquestion open to discussion. The mode of investigation here indicated\r\nis, at any rate, the only one which philosophy sanctions, and which\r\ncan ever lead to satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nTHE METALS.—Silver and copper are the only metals, pertaining to the\r\nrace of the mounds, which have been taken from their depositories.\r\nThe discovery of gold has been vaguely announced, but the fact is\r\nnot well attested.[175] It is not unlikely that articles of gold\r\nhave been found, with brass dial-plates, silver crosses, and other\r\nvestiges of European art, among the recent deposits in the mounds;\r\nand it is far from impossible that the metal may yet be disclosed,\r\nunder such circumstances as to justify the conclusion that it\r\nwas not, as from existing facts it seems to have been, an entire\r\nstranger to the ancient people. Its discovery will be no matter of\r\nsurprise; as yet, however, we have no well authenticated instance of\r\nits occurrence. Mention is made, in a published work, of a silver\r\ncup, “finely gilded in the interior,” which was said to have been\r\nfound in a mound at Marietta. It will be early enough to ask for\r\nthe verification of the statement, when any one shall be found to\r\nclaim for the cup any other than a European origin, or assign it an\r\nantiquity beyond the period of the first European intercourse.\r\n\r\nAs has been already observed, considerable quantities of wrought, and\r\nsome small fragments of unwrought native copper, have been extracted\r\nfrom the mounds. Axes, as we have seen, have been found, wrought\r\nfrom a single piece, weighing upwards of two pounds each. The metal\r\nappears, in all cases, to have been worked in a cold state. This is\r\nthe more remarkable from the fact that, in some instances, the fires\r\nupon the altars were sufficiently intense to melt down the copper\r\nimplements and ornaments deposited upon them. The hint thus afforded\r\ndoes not seem to have been seized upon. In consideration of the\r\namount of the metal discovered, implying a large original supply, and\r\nthe fact that it is occasionally found combined with silver in the\r\npeculiar manner characterizing the native deposits upon the shores\r\nof Lake Superior, we are led to conclude that it was principally, if\r\nnot wholly, derived from that region. This conclusion is sustained\r\nby the recent investigations upon the shores of that lake. These\r\nhave led to the discovery that the aborigines, from a very remote\r\nperiod, resorted there to obtain the metal. There is also evidence\r\nthat some of the more productive veins were anciently worked to a\r\nconsiderable extent. “A few rods north of the present ‘«location»’\r\nand works of the North-west Mining Company, and near the foot of the\r\nbluff, are excavations in the earth and rock, in which are found\r\nnumerous rude implements of stone, such as hammers and wedges. Pieces\r\nof copper, partially wrought into shape, are to be found at various\r\nplaces around the works. Upon the earth and rocks thrown from the\r\npits, large trees are now growing. One of these pits is sunk almost\r\nentirely in the rock, and is not far from seven feet deep. [p280] To\r\nthe north-west of this, an open cut mas made, twenty-four feet on the\r\ncourse of the vein, and from it was taken not less than a bushel of\r\nhammers and wedges of stone and pieces of copper. A few rods to the\r\nnorthward of the present works on the eastern vein of the ‘Copper\r\nFalls Location,’ and also at some distance to the south-east of the\r\nmines at the Eagle river, similar traces of ancient mining are to be\r\nobserved.”[176] [p281]\r\n\r\nThe tribes visited by De Soto indicated some portion of the South\r\nAppalachian chain as the locality whence they obtained the copper\r\nin their possession. We are ignorant of the sources whence the\r\nIndians on the Hudson procured the copper which was found among\r\nthem; it probably reached their hands by a course of exchange with\r\nwestern tribes, and came from the north-west. Silver has been found\r\nin very small quantities, and was evidently exceedingly rare among\r\nthe mound-builders. The specimens recovered are pure, and were\r\nundoubtedly derived from the same locality with the copper.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain, but nevertheless extremely probable, that the race\r\nof the mounds were acquainted with the art of reducing lead from\r\nits ores; the absence of the metal may be accounted for by the fact\r\nthat, from its nature, it could not be applied by them to any useful\r\npurpose. Too soft for axes or knives, too fusible for vessels, and\r\ntoo soon tarnished to be valuable for ornament, there was little\r\ninducement for its manufacture. Still, unless we suppose that it was\r\nvalued and used to a limited extent, we can hardly account for the\r\namount of galena found in the mounds. The nearest locality, from\r\nwhich it can be obtained in quantities equal to those found, is the\r\nmineral region of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFOSSILS.—A variety of fossils, selected for purposes of use or\r\nornament, are obtained from the mounds. Among the more remarkable may\r\nbe mentioned the fossil teeth of the shark, and some large teeth,\r\nprobably cetacean. About one hundred of the latter were found in one\r\nmound; but they were too much burned to be recovered entire. One of\r\nthe largest measures six inches in length, by about four inches in\r\ncircumference at the largest part. They are destitute of enamel, and\r\nhave a pulp cavity at the base, something like those of the whale,\r\nfrom which, however, they differ widely in shape. They have not yet\r\nbeen identified, although they have been examined by several eminent\r\nnaturalists. The mound-builders evidently used them for various\r\npurposes, and some of the articles supposed to be ivory may have been\r\nmade from them. Some of the specimens have been variously wrought,\r\ndrilled, sawn, and polished. The striæ produced by sawing are\r\ndistinctly visible. Accompanying these were found several beautifully\r\ncarved cylinders of a compact substance resembling ivory. These were\r\nvariously and tastefully ornamented. One of the rods was originally\r\nfourteen inches in length, and, when found, was closely enveloped\r\nin sheet copper. It has been suggested that these were carved from\r\nthe ribs of the manitus; the bones of which animal, [p282] we are\r\ninformed by Bartram, were much used by the Southern Indians for\r\narticles of use and ornament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.—Half size.]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the fossil teeth of the shark recovered from the mounds\r\nare represented in the cut, Fig. 197. It will be observed that they\r\nare of different species. They seem to have been used for various\r\npurposes. Some have holes drilled through them near the base; others\r\nare notched, as if designed to form spear or arrow-heads. Raleigh\r\nobserved some used as such among the Indians of Carolina. It seems\r\nmost probable that they were designed for cutting purposes. No. 2 is\r\nfragmentary; the remaining portion was not found. It will be seen\r\nthat it had a hole drilled through it near the base, and was notched\r\nat the sides. We are of course ignorant of the locality from which\r\nthey were obtained. It is a well known fact, however, that they are\r\nabundant in the tertiary formations of the Lower Mississippi.[177]\r\nFrom this direction must have come the teeth of the alligator, a\r\nnumber of which have been obtained from the mounds.\r\n\r\nPEARLS.—Mention has been made, on a preceding page, of the great\r\nnumber of pearls found in the mounds. It is incredible to suppose\r\nthat a hundredth part of these were obtained from the molluscs of\r\nour rivers. The question then arises, whence were they obtained? As\r\nhas already been stated, the Indians of the South and South-west\r\nused them extensively as ornaments at the time of the Discovery, and\r\nat that time, it appears from the chroniclers, maintained regular\r\nfisheries for them.[178] If we may credit the early writers, they\r\nwere abundant among all the nations inhabiting the shores and islands\r\nof the Gulf, and were found in considerable numbers on the Atlantic\r\ncoast, as far north as Virginia. Raleigh saw them on the coast of\r\nNorth Carolina. Heriot, in his Voyage to the Shores of Virginia,\r\nsays: “Sometimes in feeding on muscles we find pearls; but it was\r\nour hap to meet those which were ragged and of a pied color, not\r\nyet having discovered the country where we heard of better and more\r\nplenty. One of our company, a man of skill in such matters, had\r\ngathered from among the savage people about [p283] «five thousand;»\r\nof which number he chose so many as made a fair chain, which for\r\ntheir likeness and uniformity in roundness, orientness, and piedness,\r\nof many excellent colors, with equality in greatness, had been\r\npresented to her majesty, had not a casualty by sea lost them.”\r\n\r\nRibaulde, at an earlier day, (1562,) wrote in extravagant terms of\r\nthe quantities of pearls which he saw on the coast of Florida. “They\r\nhad also a great abundance of pearls; which they declared unto us\r\nthey took out of oysters, and in so marvellous abundance, as is scant\r\ncredible: and we perceive that there are as many and faire pearls\r\nfound there, as in any country of the world. For we saw one man who\r\nhad a pearl hanging at the end of a chain of gold and silver, as\r\ngreat as an acorn at the least.”\r\n\r\nThe Decades of Peter Martyr teem with exclamations of surprise\r\nand wonder at their great number and beauty; they elicit both his\r\npraise and his philosophy.[179] We may therefore safely derive the\r\npearls found in the mounds from the Gulf. Together with numerous\r\nother remains, they go to establish an extensive communication with\r\nsouthern and tropical regions, or a migration from that direction. At\r\npresent it is believed no pearl-fisheries are maintained, except upon\r\nthe coast of California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.]\r\n\r\nMARINE SHELLS.—The «cassis» and «pyrula perversa» of Lamark; the\r\n«oliva», «marginella», and «natica»; as well as the columella of a\r\nshell, probably the «strombus», have been found in the mounds. A\r\n«cassis» of large size, from which the inner whorls and columella\r\nhad been removed to adapt it for use as a vessel, was found in mound\r\nNo. 5, in the great enclosure, Plate X. It is doubtful whether this\r\nparticular shell belongs to the era of the mounds, or is of a later\r\ndate. Portions of these shells have nevertheless been found upon the\r\naltars, and they were consequently known to the mound-builders. This\r\nspecimen is eleven inches and a half in length, by twenty-four in\r\ncircumference at the largest part. Specimens have been found in the\r\nvicinity of Nashville, from which the inner whorls had been removed\r\nso as to give place to an idol of clay or stone.[180] Fragments only\r\nof the «pyrula», Fig. 198, have been found in the mounds; although\r\nquite a number have been [p284] discovered entire in excavating at\r\ndifferent points in the Scioto valley. In digging the Ohio and Erie\r\ncanal, there was found near Portsmouth, its southern terminus on the\r\nOhio river, a cluster of five or six, which appeared to have been\r\nthus carefully deposited by the hand of man. They were about three\r\nfeet beneath the surface. The columellæ of some large shell, probably\r\nthe «strombus gigas», have also been discovered. Most of the shell\r\nbeads and ornaments from the mounds appear to have been manufactured\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nAll these shells are found in the Gulf. The «strombus» is observed on\r\nthe shores of the West Indies and Florida; the «cassis» occurs in the\r\nsame localities, as do also the «pyrula» and the minor shells above\r\nmentioned. A very large number of the «marginella» were taken from\r\nthe Grave creek mound.[181]\r\n\r\nFLUVIATILE SHELLS.—Examples of the «unios» of the Western rivers also\r\noccur in the mounds, generally entire, but sometimes manufactured.\r\nThe «unio ellipticus», «crassus», «rectus», «verrucosus», and\r\n«ovatus» have been identified, all existing, at the present time,\r\nin the neighboring streams. They occur side by side with the marine\r\nshells and other remains heretofore noticed.\r\n\r\nMINERALS.—This department is very rich, and comprises some very\r\ninteresting and beautiful varieties,—mica, transparent, opaque,\r\nsilvery, and graphic; obsidian; quartz, many varieties; serpentine;\r\nporphyry, several beautiful kinds; manganesian garnet, in crystals;\r\nvariegated slate, beautifully colored; catlinite or red pipe-stone\r\n(?); limestone, common and coralline, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMICA is abundant in the mounds and in the vicinity of ancient\r\nworks, where it is often ploughed up. It seems to be extensively\r\ndisseminated, south as well as north. The common, transparent,\r\nsilvery or opaque, and graphic or hieroglyphical varieties, have\r\nbeen discovered; some specimens have a golden color, much resembling\r\n“Dutch leaf.” It is in general neatly cut into ornamental figures,\r\nscrolls, discs, and oval plates. These plates are frequently a foot\r\nor more in diameter, and a fourth or half an inch in thickness. In\r\na mound at Circleville, a plate is said to have been found, three\r\nfeet in length, one foot and a half in breadth, and one inch and\r\na half in thickness. It has been suggested that these plates were\r\ndesigned as mirrors; but there seems to be no good foundation for\r\nthe supposition.[182] The opaque varieties, from their beauty, seem\r\nto have been uniformly applied to ornamental purposes, having often,\r\nas appears from the holes occasioned by the process, been worked\r\ninto scarfs or attached to the martial or priestly robes of the\r\nancient people. The mineral seems also to have been consecrated to\r\nsome religious purpose. It appears at various points in the mounds,\r\nand is sometimes found resting on the breasts or above the heads of\r\n[p285] skeletons. It has also been found covering one sacrificial\r\naltar, and regularly disposed in the form of a crescent before\r\nanother. (See pages 144 and 154.) The suggestion has been advanced\r\nthat it was consecrated to some divinity, equivalent to the Mexican\r\n«Tezcatlipoca», “Lord of the Light.”\r\n\r\nThe mica of the mounds is often found fissile and fragile, perhaps\r\nthe result of exposure to heat, but generally quite compact and\r\npossessing its original tenacity. Some very fine specimens of the\r\ngraphic or discolored mica have been found in the mounds of the\r\nScioto valley and elsewhere. Fifteen or twenty beautiful oval plates\r\nof this variety were taken recently from a low mound near Lower\r\nSandusky, Ohio. They are beautiful specimens, stained with a solution\r\nof some of the oxides of iron or manganese, during the process of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nMica, like many other substances, crystallizes in oblique rhombic\r\nprisms whose planes are 60° and 120°. When these planes are colored,\r\nthey resemble many letters of the alphabet. The specimens in question\r\nare iridescent, exhibiting all the prismatic colors when the light\r\nfalls upon them in a certain direction. These circumstances no\r\ndoubt gave rise to the idea that they were painted hieroglyphics.\r\nGraphic mica occurs, in place, on the Schuylkill, some distance above\r\nPhiladelphia, and probably in other localities. No original deposit\r\nof the mineral exists in the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nOBSIDIAN, the «itzli» of the Mexicans, and «gallinazo stone» of\r\nthe Peruvians. Frequent reference has been had to this mineral,\r\nprecluding the necessity of an extended notice here. It has been\r\nobserved in five of the mounds excavated in the Scioto valley,\r\nfrom one of which a number of large and very fine specimens were\r\nobtained (page 155). It is only found in the form of implements, such\r\nas knives and spear and arrow-points. This mineral is a volcanic\r\nproduct, and occurs, so far as known, no nearer than Mexico, where it\r\nis found in abundance. It is also found in Peru, and was extensively\r\nused by the ancient inhabitants of both countries, for cutting and\r\nwarlike implements. They also, notwithstanding its obstinacy and\r\nfragility, worked it elegantly into mirrors, ornamental rings, and\r\nmasks.[183] Some specimens have been discovered in the mounds of\r\nTennessee, which were doubtless obtained from the same source with\r\nthose found on the Ohio.[184] All the specimens discovered are glassy\r\nblack, subtranslucent, and break with a clear conchoidal fracture.\r\nAccording to Humboldt, the mountains of Jacul or Cerro Gordo, on\r\nthe route between Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico, furnished the\r\ncelebrated «itzli» quarries or mines of the ancient Mexicans; the\r\nlocality is still known as «El Cerro de los Nabijas», the Mountain of\r\nKnives.[185] This is believed to be the nearest point of its [p286]\r\noccurrence. Lieut. Fremont observed some small nodules in the rocks\r\nof the «Sierra Nevada», lying to the eastward of the valley of the\r\nSacramento. He also found numerous fragments on the hills bordering\r\nthe Lewis fork of the Columbia river.\r\n\r\nPORPHYRY.—Most of the sculptured pipes of the mounds are made of a\r\nvery fine and beautiful description of porphyry. It occurs of many\r\nshades of color. Some varieties are of a greenish-brown base, with\r\nfine white and black granules; others of a light brown base with\r\nwhite, purple, and violet-tinged specks; but most are red, with white\r\nand purplish grains. In some specimens the base scarcely exhibits\r\nany admixture either of grains or crystals, and strongly resembles\r\nthe red pipe-stone of the «Coteau des Prairies». All are of intense\r\nhardness,—a natural characteristic, or in some degree the result of\r\nthe great heat to which they have been subjected. It generally breaks\r\nwith a granular fracture, sometimes disengaging the grains of the\r\nforeign material. Under heat it splinters, often on very nearly the\r\nsame plane; pieces partly fused into a porous, dull mass, have been\r\nremarked. Heat has also the effect of giving a bright black color to\r\nthe fragments more particularly exposed to its influence, and some of\r\nthe restored sculptures present a striking contrast in the appearance\r\nof their parts. It would seem incredible that the different fragments\r\noriginally pertained to the same piece, did they not exactly fit to\r\neach other. One or two of the varieties seem to have an argillaceous\r\nbase, adhere slightly when applied to the tongue, and have a marked\r\nargillaceous odor; these exhibit a rather dull surface, while the\r\nothers are exquisitely polished. It is difficult to tell how the\r\nancient inhabitants worked this obstinate material with the elegance\r\nand finish which their sculptures display. It resists the best\r\ntempered blade, and yields reluctantly to the finest grit stones.\r\nYet it is clear from the markings on certain specimens that it was\r\ncut by some kind of implement. We can only account for the fact by\r\nsupposing that it was once much softer than it now is. Under such a\r\nsupposition, it is not improbable that it may have been derived from\r\na locality mentioned by Du Pratz, on the Missouri. So far as the\r\nexternal features of the stone are concerned, the description is very\r\nexact; we are left in doubt, however, as to the size of the granules,\r\nwhich in the mound pipes are seldom larger than mustard seeds.\r\n\r\n“In this journey of M. de Borgmont, mention is made only of what we\r\nmeet with from Fort Orleans, from which we set out, in order to go to\r\nthe Padoucas; wherefore I ought to speak of a thing curious enough\r\nto be related, which is found on the banks of the Missouri; and that\r\nis a pretty high cliff, upright from the water. From the middle\r\nof the cliff juts out a mass of «red stone with white spots, like\r\nporphyry», with this difference, that what we are now speaking of is\r\nalmost soft and tender like sandstone. It is covered with another\r\nsort of stone of no value; the bottom is an earth like that on other\r\nrising grounds. The stone is easily worked and bears the most violent\r\nfire. The Indians of the country have contrived to strike off pieces\r\nthereof with their arrows, and after they fall in the water plunge\r\nin for them. When they procure pieces large enough to make pipes,\r\nthey fashion them with knives and awls. This pipe has a socket two or\r\nthree [p287] inches long, and on the opposite side the figure of a\r\nhatchet; in the middle of all is the bort or bowl to put the tobacco\r\nin.”[186]\r\n\r\nThe fashion of the pipe here described is that adopted by the modern\r\nIndians; and the paragraph is introduced as suggestive, rather\r\nthan as indicating the unknown locality of this singular stone. A\r\ndescription of red porphyry is said to occur upon the shores of Lake\r\nSuperior; but in the absence of specimens for comparison, it is\r\nimpossible to say how far it resembles that found in the mounds.\r\n\r\nMany of the ancient carvings are executed in a description of\r\ncompact slate, of a dull green ground, relieved with stripes of a\r\ndark black color, giving the stone a fibrous appearance, and leading\r\nmany uninformed persons to suppose that it is petrified wood. It has\r\na very fine grain, cuts clearly and readily, and receives a high\r\nfinish. It seems to have been chiefly used for ornamental purposes.\r\nNo one has, as yet, been able to identify its primitive locality. A\r\nsingle implement of this material was found a number of years ago,\r\nnear Middletown, Connecticut. (See page 218.)\r\n\r\nAnother variety of stone, of a high specific gravity, dark ground,\r\nthickly interspersed with minute flakes of salmon-colored mica, is\r\nalso found. It is not abundant. It has thus far defied scrutiny, and\r\nits primitive locality is unascertained. It is often very tastefully\r\nworked into rings, figures of animals, etc. It cuts without\r\ndifficulty, and receives a very high polish.[187]\r\n\r\nThe axes, pestles, etc., of the mound-builders, like those formerly\r\nin use by the Indian tribes, are composed of tough sienitic rocks,\r\ngreenstone, etc. The material must have been derived from primitive\r\nlocalities, or from boulders of primitive rocks.\r\n\r\nBesides these varieties of stone, we find articles composed of\r\nevery description of quartz; of brown hematite; steatite, black and\r\nmottled; slate; limestone, etc. Some very pretty articles are worked\r\nfrom coralline limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[175] Archæologia Americana, vol. i. p. 176. The report here alluded\r\nto has been traced to its source. The ornament was not of gold but of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n[176] These statements are confirmed by several observers. The\r\nsubjoined passages are from a letter from the eminent geologist and\r\nmineralogist, Prof. W. W. MATHER.\r\n\r\n“I am informed by gentlemen connected with the survey of the\r\ngovernment mineral lands, that abundant traces of ancient mining\r\nare to be observed at the Copper Falls and Eagle river mines. It is\r\nstated that on the hill south of the Copper Falls mine an excavation\r\nseveral feet in depth, and some rods in length, was discovered\r\nextending along the course of the vein. Fragments of rock, etc.,\r\nthrown out of the excavation, were piled up along its sides, the\r\nwhole covered with soil, and overgrown with bushes and trees. On\r\nremoving the accumulations from the excavation, stone axes of large\r\nsize, made of greenstone, and shaped to receive withe handles, were\r\nfound. Some large, round, greenstone masses, that had apparently been\r\nused for sledges were also found. They had round holes bored in them\r\nto the depth of several inches, which seemed to have been designed\r\nfor wooden plugs, to which withe handles might be attached, so that\r\nseveral men could swing them with sufficient force to batter or break\r\nthe rock and the projecting masses of copper. Some of them were\r\nbroken, and some of the projecting ends of rock exhibited distinct\r\nmarks of having been battered in the manner here suggested.”\r\n\r\nThe great Ontonagon mass of virgin copper, now deposited in\r\nWashington, when found, exhibited marks of having had considerable\r\nportions cut from it, and the ground around was strewn with fragments\r\nof stone axes which had been broken in endeavors to detach portions\r\nof the mass. Henry («Travels» p. 195) observes that the Indians\r\nobtained much copper from the above localities, which they worked\r\ninto spoons, bracelets, etc. He saw one piece in their possession,\r\nweighing twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe following additional information embraced in a private letter\r\nto a gentleman of Buffalo, under date of June 15, 1848, relating to\r\nancient mining on the shores of Lake Superior, will prove highly\r\ninteresting in this connection. The new discoveries which it\r\nrecords seem to establish that the mines were anciently extensively\r\nworked, and the copper extracted in large masses. Were it not for\r\nthe abundance of stone implements in the excavations, it might be\r\nsupposed that they were the traces of the later operations of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n“The gentlemen connected with Vulcan Mining Company have made some\r\nvery singular discoveries in working one of the veins which has been\r\nlately found. They discovered an old cave, excavated centuries ago.\r\nThis led them to look for other works of the same kind, and they have\r\nfound a number of sinks in the earth which they have traced a long\r\ndistance. By digging into those sinks, they find them to have been\r\nmade by the hand of man. It appears that the ancient miners worked\r\non a different principle from that adopted at the present time. The\r\ngreatest depth yet found in these holes is thirty feet. After getting\r\ndown to a certain depth, the ancient miners drifted along the vein\r\nmaking an open cut. These cuts have been filled nearly to a level by\r\nthe accumulation of soil, and we find trees of the largest growth\r\nstanding in the depressions, and also find that trees of a very\r\nlarge size have grown up and died, and decayed many years since in\r\nthe same places there are now standing others of over three hundred\r\nyears’ growth. Last week they dug down into a new place, and about\r\ntwelve feet below the surface found a mass of copper weighing from\r\neight to ten tons. This mass was buried in ashes, and it appears the\r\nancient miners could not handle it, and having no means of cutting\r\nit, probably built fire around it to melt or separate the rock, which\r\nmight be done by heating and then dashing on cold water. This piece\r\nof copper is pure and free from corrosion. The upper surface has been\r\npounded smooth. It appears that this mass of copper was taken from\r\nthe bottom of a shaft, at the depth of about thirty feet. In sinking\r\nthis shaft from where the mass now lies, they followed the course of\r\nthe vein, which dips considerably, this enabled them to raise it as\r\nfar as the hole came up with a slant. At the bottom of the shaft were\r\nfound skids of black oak from eight to twelve inches in diameter,\r\nthese sticks were charred through, as if burnt; large wooden wedges\r\nwere also found in the same situation. In this shaft were discovered\r\na miner’s ‘gad’ and a narrow chisel made of copper. I do not know\r\nwhether these copper tools are tempered or not, but they display\r\ngood workmanship. There have been taken out of the excavations more\r\nthan a ton of cobble-stones, which have been used as mallets. These\r\nstones were nearly round, with a groove cut round the centre, for the\r\npurpose of putting a withe around for a handle. The Chippewas all say\r\nthat this work was never done by Indians. This discovery will lead to\r\na new method of finding veins in this country, and may be of great\r\nbenefit to explorers. I suppose the miners will continue to find new\r\nwonders for some time yet, as it is but a short time since they first\r\nfound the old mine.”\r\n\r\n[177] B. L. C.

Before the blow-pipe it does not change. It\r\nfuses with soda, with difficulty, into a dark bead,—soluble in nitric\r\nacid, leaving a considerable residuum of «silicia».

The superficial burials,\r\nit has been abundantly shown, are of comparatively late date, and\r\nare to be ascribed to the Indian tribes found in occupation of the\r\ncountry, at the period of its discovery in the fifteenth century.\r\nThese skeletons are seldom deposited more than two or three feet\r\nbelow the surface, and are generally perfect; the crania rarely if\r\never crushed, and the bones still retaining a portion of their animal\r\nmatter. In the ancient burials, on the other hand, the skeletons\r\nare almost invariably found at the base of the mounds, and in such\r\na state of decay as to render all attempts to restore the skull, or\r\nindeed any part of the skeleton, entirely hopeless. The crania, when\r\nnot so much decomposed as to crumble to powder beneath the touch, are\r\ncrushed and flattened by the falling in of the sepulchral chambers,\r\nand by the weight of the superincumbent earth.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore unable to present much new light upon the cranial\r\nconformation of the race of the mounds. The only skull incontestibly\r\nbelonging to an individual of that race, which has been recovered\r\nentire, or sufficiently well preserved to be of value for purposes of\r\ncomparison, was taken from the hill-mound, numbered 8 in the Map of a\r\nsection of twelve miles of the Scioto valley, Plate II. Plate XLVII\r\nis a full-sized side view, and Plate XLVIII presents reduced vertical\r\nand front views of the skull in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLVII. From an Ancient Mound in Scioto Valley O.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XLVIII. Front and Vertical View of the Same.]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which this skull was found are altogether so\r\nextraordinary, as to merit a detailed account. It will be observed\r\nfrom the map, that the mound above indicated is situated upon the\r\nsummit of a high hill, overlooking the valley of the Scioto, about\r\nfour miles below the city of Chillicothe. It is one of the most\r\nprominent and commanding positions in that section of country. Upon\r\nthe summit of this hill rises a conical knoll of so great regularity\r\nas almost to induce the belief that it is itself artificial. Upon the\r\nvery apex of this knoll, and covered by the trees of the primitive\r\nforest, is the mound. It is about eight feet high by forty-five or\r\nfifty feet base. The superstructure is a tough yellow clay, which at\r\nthe depth of three feet is intermixed with large rough stones, as\r\nshown in the accompanying section, Fig. 199.\r\n\r\nThese stones rest upon a dry carbonaceous deposit of burned earth\r\nand small stones, of a dark black color, and much compacted. This\r\ndeposit is about two feet in thickness in the centre, and rests upon\r\nthe original soil. In excavating the mound, a large plate of mica\r\nwas discovered placed upon the stones, at the point indicated by\r\nthe letter «a» in the section. Immediately underneath this plate of\r\n[p289] mica and in the centre of the burned deposit, was found\r\nthe skull figured in the plates. It was discovered resting upon its\r\nface. The lower jaw, as indeed the entire skeleton, excepting the\r\nclavicle, a few cervical vertebræ, and some of the bones of the feet,\r\nall of which were huddled around the skull, were wanting. No relics\r\nwere found with the bones, except a few shells of the fresh-water\r\nmolluscs from the neighboring river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.]\r\n\r\nFrom the entire singularity of this burial it might be inferred that\r\nthe deposit was a comparatively recent one; but the fact that the\r\nvarious layers of carbonaceous earth, stones, and clay were entirely\r\nundisturbed, and in no degree intermixed, settles the question beyond\r\ndoubt, that the skull was placed where it was found at the time of\r\nthe construction of the mound. Either, therefore, we must admit that\r\nthe skull is a genuine relic of the mound-builders proper, or assume\r\nthe improbable alternative that the mound in question does not belong\r\nto the grand system of earthworks of which we have been treating.\r\n\r\nThe skull is wonderfully well preserved; unaccountably so, unless\r\nthe circumstances under which it was found may be regarded as most\r\nfavorable to such a result. The imperviousness of the mound to water,\r\nfrom the nature of the material composing it, and its position on the\r\nsummit of an eminence subsiding in every direction from its base,\r\nare circumstances which, joined to the antiseptic qualities of the\r\ncarbonaceous deposit enveloping the skull, may satisfactorily account\r\nfor its excellent preservation.\r\n\r\nOf course no general conclusion as to the cranial characteristics\r\nof the ancient people can be based upon a single skull. It may\r\nnevertheless not be wholly unimportant or uninteresting to notice\r\nparticularly the more prominent peculiarities of the specimen before\r\nus. The most striking feature is its extraordinary compactness or\r\nroundness. This will best be illustrated by the measurements, which\r\nshow the vertical diameter to be 6.2 inches; longitudinal diameter\r\n6.5 inches; inter-parietal diameter 6 inches. The vertical occiput,\r\nthe prominent vertex, and great inter-parietal diameter, all of which\r\nare strongly marked in this skull, are, according to Dr. Morton,\r\nfeatures characteristic of the American race, but more particularly\r\nof the family which he denominates the Toltecan, and of which the\r\nPeruvian head may be taken as the type. This skull was accurately\r\nmeasured by Dr. Morton, with the following results:\r\n\r\n MEASUREMENTS.\r\n Longitudinal diameter.    6.5 inches.\r\n Inter-parietal diameter.  6   inches.\r\n Vertical diameter.        6.2 inches.\r\n Frontal diameter.         4.5 inches.\r\n Inter-mastoid arch,      16   inches.\r\n Inter-mastoid line,       4.5 inches.\r\n Occipito-frontal arch,   13.8 inches.\r\n Horizontal periphery,    19.8 inches.\r\n Facial angle,            81   degrees.\r\n Internal capacity,       90   cubic inches.\r\n\r\n[p290]\r\n\r\nDr. Morton, in his «Crania Americana», has presented a number of\r\nexamples of skulls from the mounds. Five of these are from mounds\r\nwithin the United States, and three are from the sepulchral tumuli of\r\nPeru. Those of the United States were obtained,—one from the Grave\r\ncreek mound, one from a mound near the junction of the French Broad\r\nand Tennessee rivers in Tennessee, one from a mound on the Alabama\r\nriver, one from a mound near Circleville in Ohio, and one from a\r\nmound on the Upper Mississippi. The first two may be regarded as\r\ngenuine remains of the mound-builders; but it is more than probable,\r\nfor reasons already advanced, that the rest are skulls of the recent\r\nIndians, who, as we have seen, often buried in the mounds. Numbers\r\nof these have been discovered by the authors in the mounds, and\r\nthe measurements of four of them are introduced in the following\r\ncomparative table, A, where they are indicated by an asterisk. This\r\ntable exhibits the measurements of the mound skull discovered by the\r\nauthors; of the eight skulls described by Dr. Morton; of four modern\r\nskulls recovered from the mounds; of a skull taken from the Mammoth\r\nCave of Kentucky, three thousand yards from its mouth, and now in the\r\npossession of Messrs. FOWLERS & WELLS, of New York; and also of the\r\nskull of a mummy or desiccated body, taken from the same cave, and\r\nnow in the Museum of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester,\r\nMass. It will be seen that the conclusion already adopted respecting\r\nthree of the skulls noticed in the Crania Americana, are sustained\r\nby the general coincidence in measurements between them and those\r\nindubitably of recent date.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively large facial angle and great internal capacity of\r\nthe skull figured in the plate cannot fail to attract attention. The\r\nmean internal capacity of the eight heads presented by Dr. Morton is\r\nbut eighty-one cubic inches, while the facial angle does not exceed\r\nseventy-five degrees. The accompanying table, B, exhibiting the mean\r\nresults of Dr. Morton’s measurements of American aboriginal heads, as\r\ncompared with the skull in question, and the mean measurements of the\r\nskulls supposed to pertain to the race of the mounds, may not prove\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority, the mean internal capacity of the\r\nCaucasian head is 87 cubic inch; of the Mongolian, 83; Malay, 81;\r\nAmerican, 82; Ethiopian, 78.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been presented, it will be seen that the skull here\r\ndescribed exhibits, in a marked degree, the cranial characteristics\r\nof the American race, of which it may be regarded as a perfect type.\r\nWhether its peculiarities of form may not be, in part, artificial, it\r\nis not assumed to determine. It may nevertheless be observed, that\r\nthe Natchez and Peruvians, as also many of the savage tribes, moulded\r\nthe heads of their children in a variety of forms. The naturally\r\nvertical occiput was undoubtedly generally rendered the more marked\r\nby the almost universal practice of lashing the infant with its back\r\nagainst a board, by which it was suspended or carried about.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the inferior maxillary bones of the mound skeletons\r\nhave been recovered, nearly entire. They are remarkable for their\r\nmassiveness, and seem to have been less projecting than those\r\npertaining to the skeletons of a later date.

Their general character\r\nseems, however, but imperfectly understood; and for this reason\r\ncare has been taken to preserve sketches and descriptions of such\r\nas fell under notice in the progress of the investigations recorded\r\nin this volume. In presenting the following illustrations, we are\r\nnot to be understood as supposing that any of these rude monuments\r\nare referable to the era of the mounds, or that they have any\r\nextraordinary significance.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations comprise sketches of six sculptured rocks which\r\noccur upon the Guyandotte river in Virginia, and which have never\r\nbefore been noticed; together with a sketch of one occurring upon\r\nthe Ohio river, never before figured, but to which distant allusion\r\nhas several times been made. Notices of the locality and general\r\ncharacter of several others, occurring chiefly within the valley of\r\nthe Ohio, are also appended.\r\n\r\nProceeding upon a very vague intimation of the existence of certain\r\nrocks of this kind, upon the banks of the Guyandotte river, in\r\nCabell county, Virginia, a visit was made to the locality in the\r\nautumn of 1846. The first of the series of rocks was found near the\r\npathway, about eight miles above the town of Barbersville, or sixteen\r\nmiles above the mouth of the river. It is a large detached block of\r\nweather-worn sandstone, of coarse texture, presenting above ground\r\na flat but somewhat irregular surface. The edges are much rounded,\r\nand the rock closely resembles the water-worn boulders sometimes\r\nfound on the alluvions. Immediately in the centre, which is slightly\r\ndepressed, is cut in outline a rude effigy of a human figure, with\r\narms extended and elevated, and apparently in the attitude of\r\nrunning. It is manifestly intended to represent a female, the breasts\r\nand other distinctive features being depicted. The action of the\r\nfigure is well expressed, and the proportions are not materially\r\nwrong. It is four feet in height. Upon the edges of the rock are\r\nother outlines of the human figure, though too much obliterated to be\r\ntraced with satisfaction or exactness. They are considerably less in\r\nsize than the one just described. Besides these there are cut into\r\nthe rock, at all angles to the plane of stratification, a number of\r\ntracks of various beasts and birds. Among them are those of the deer,\r\nbear, wolf, and turkey. They are very truthfully indicated, and it\r\nis no longer a matter of [p294] surprise that similar sculptures\r\nhave been mistaken by the uninformed for veritable impressions from\r\nthe feet of the animals themselves. They were cut at a later date\r\nthan the other figures, or have been cut deeper or subsequently\r\nretouched. The turkey tracks are as distinct as if they had been left\r\nbut yesterday in plastic clay by the bird itself. Among the tracks of\r\nthe animals occurs the Roman capital P, exactly formed. This cannot\r\nbe supposed to be anything more than an accidental coincidence. The\r\nlines are from one half to three fourths of an inch deep, and for the\r\nmost part appear to have been «pecked», instead of chiselled, into\r\nthe stone. The rock measures about ten feet square. It lies close by\r\nthe side of the road or bridle-path, upon the east bank, and about\r\nseventy-five yards from the river. Just below this point is quite a\r\nbroad interval of level land, which is now under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.]\r\n\r\nFrom this place onward, the path winds under beetling cliffs of\r\nragged sandstone, huge blocks of which, occasionally worn into\r\nfantastic shapes, are met at every step. At the distance of two\r\nmiles, the traveller comes suddenly upon a confused mass of rocks,\r\nweighing many thousands of tons each, which have fallen from the\r\nvery brow of the cliff, crushing the puny forests in their course\r\nand bedding themselves deep in the earth, which it has forced up\r\nin billows around them. Here occur the sculptured rocks of the\r\nGuyandotte. Two only had been heard of originally; but after a\r\ncareful examination, removing fallen trees and stones and rubbish,\r\nthree others were discovered, which, if not so large, nevertheless\r\nproved quite as interesting as those which had at first attracted\r\nattention. Drawings were taken of these on the spot, which will give\r\na better conception of the character of the sculptures, than any\r\ndescription can possibly afford.\r\n\r\nFig. 201. The larger rock measures thirteen feet in length by an\r\naverage of ten feet in width. Upon its horizontal face is cut, in\r\ndeep outline, the figure of a man, six feet three inches in height,\r\nby two feet in breadth at the shoulders. There seems to have been\r\nno attempt at drapery. The proportions of the figure, the curve\r\nof the leg, etc., are very well represented. The legs are placed\r\nnear [p295] together, the feet turned outwards, and the arms\r\nrepresented close by the side of the body. Something like a cocked\r\nhat, perhaps designed to represent the hair, covers the head. The\r\nface is triangular, and the eyes are represented by lines somewhat\r\nresembling an inverted W. The nose and mouth are indicated by simple\r\nlines. From the neck depends a singular figure, which rests upon the\r\nbreast. Perhaps it had a typical meaning, in common with similar\r\nrepresentations among the wild Indians of the present day. The head\r\nof a deer or elk, with its branching antlers, is depicted upon\r\nthe face of the rock below, and considerably to the right of the\r\nfeet of the principal figure. There are also the tracks of certain\r\nanimals, and two rows of round holes, numbering thirteen and fifteen\r\nrespectively,—these last perhaps designed to indicate the number of\r\nachievements in war or chase of the chieftain whose effigy is beside\r\nthem. There are many other lines; but the surface of the rock is so\r\nmuch worn and frayed by exposure to the elements, that it is quite\r\nimpossible to make them out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.]\r\n\r\nFig. 202. Upon one of the vertical faces of this rock is cut, in bold\r\nand deep outline, the figure of an eagle, with wings extended as if\r\njust soaring upwards. [p296] This is extremely spirited in design,\r\nand exhibits no small degree of artistic skill,—much more than is\r\ndisplayed in the engraving. A plume feather rises from the head of\r\nthe bird. Immediately by its side is a rude outline of some bird with\r\nlong neck and drooping wings. These figures are about two feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.]\r\n\r\nFig. 203. Upon another rock, close by the side of the one last\r\nmentioned, from which it appears to have been split off, is a\r\nsculptured group, manifestly representing a hunting scene. A deer or\r\nelk and several human figures, in attitudes of motion, are especially\r\nprominent. There is also a maze of lines which a fanciful mind might\r\neasily convert into an inscription in an ancient alphabet. Many\r\nof these lines are indistinct from exposure; those shown in the\r\nengraving are well marked. The rock measures four feet by ten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.]\r\n\r\nFig. 204. A third rock near by, almost entirely hidden by the ruins\r\nbrought down by the rock avalanche from above, bears upon its face\r\na figure of angular outline, resembling the outspread skin of some\r\nanimal. The eyes and mouth are distinctly marked. By its side is\r\nthe figure of a human head, and several wolf and deer tracks. There\r\nmay be other sculptures on the rock; the portion exhibited in the\r\nengraving was exposed only by the expenditure of much severe labor,\r\nin the absence of tools for excavation. [p297]\r\n\r\nFig. 205. At the distance of a few rods from these is a small rock,\r\nfour feet high by six in length. Upon its vertical face are cut the\r\nhead and shoulders of an elk. The figure is faithfully executed,\r\nof full size, and in point of spirit can hardly be excelled by\r\nany outline representation. The savage artist who worked this\r\nhead, with his rude instruments, into the living rock, must have\r\nbeen a close observer of nature. He undoubtedly stood at the head\r\nof his profession—an Indian Landseer! Below this head is a rude\r\nrepresentation of some object, probably a bow, an arrow from which is\r\nentering the neck of the elk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.]\r\n\r\nThere are unquestionably other rocks, in this immediate vicinity,\r\ncovered over with earth and rubbish from the avalanche. The labors of\r\nthe excavator would doubtless be rewarded with other discoveries; the\r\nemployment however of some less primitive means than sharpened sticks\r\nand the naked hands can be feelingly recommended.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the vicinity of these rocks, it was ascertained that\r\nthree miles higher up the stream, at a point known as the “Falls of\r\nthe Guyandotte,” there are others of a similar character. The figure\r\nof a man, with an upraised tomahawk, and that of a fox or other\r\nanimal, are cut in the vertical face of the cliff, over which the\r\nriver lately flowed, but which is now left exposed by some change in\r\nthe channel of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe rocks above described occur in a sunny nook a short distance from\r\nthe river, at a point where there is a small but beautiful interval\r\nof land. There is here a small earth circle and mound, showing that\r\nthe race of the mounds penetrated thus far up the stream.\r\n\r\nThe rocks are weather-worn fragments of the coarse sandstone of\r\nthe coal series, which breaks with a tolerably smooth and regular\r\nfracture, presenting surfaces well calculated for the kind of rude\r\nsculpture here exhibited. The lines upon the horizontal faces of\r\nthe rocks are much less distinct than those upon their sides. They\r\nseem nevertheless to have been cut deeper, and are more elaborate.\r\nThose upon the vertical faces of the rocks seem to be little defaced,\r\nand probably are much in the same condition in which they were left\r\nby the sculptors. They are, for the most [p298] part, about three\r\nfourths of an inch wide by half an inch deep, sometimes a little\r\nwider and deeper: the outline of the principal figure on the large\r\nrock is not less than an inch wide and three fourths of an inch deep.\r\nSome of the round holes, which are very regular, will contain a gill\r\nof water each. The lines, as observed respecting the rock first\r\nnoticed, do not appear to have been chiselled, but «pecked» into the\r\nstone. Where hard iron seams occur in the rock, a narrow ridge is\r\nleft,—the rude instruments employed having evidently been inadequate\r\nto cut or break through them. That some of the tracks of animals,\r\nparticularly those of the bear, were rubbed and smoothed with stones\r\nafter having been chipped into shape, seems extremely probable, from\r\nthe fact that they are not rough like the other lines, and exhibit\r\nthe muscular developments of the foot with much accuracy. It is\r\nbarely possible that they have been thus worn by the action of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.]\r\n\r\nFig. 206. A rock of similar character with those above described,\r\noccurs upon the Virginia shore of the Ohio river, four miles above\r\nthe town of Steubenville in the State of Ohio, and about fifty\r\nmiles below the city of Pittsburgh.[188] It is a detached block of\r\nsandstone, measuring seven feet by nine. The figures are cut in the\r\nsame style with those before noticed, and are quite numerous. They\r\ncomprise outlines of men and animals, including the tortoise and\r\nseveral serpents. There are also human footprints, and the tracks of\r\nanimals, together with other emblematic figures, including the Indian\r\nsymbol of the sun. The striking resemblance of the lower right-hand\r\nfigures to those occupying a corresponding position on the Dighton\r\nrock, will not be overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.—SITE OF THE SCULPTURED ROCKS OF THE\r\nGUYANDOTTE.]\r\n\r\nA very interesting rock of this description lately existed at\r\nCatlettsburgh, on the Kentucky shore, at the confluence of the Big\r\nSandy and Ohio rivers. It was [p299] entirely broken up about two\r\nyears since, by a Vandal, to furnish the materials for building a\r\nchimney and walling a cellar! By a strange fatality this rock was\r\nselected for the purpose, although there were an abundance of others\r\nin the vicinity. It is represented to have been charged with numerous\r\noutline figures and emblematic devices. Efforts were made to recover\r\nsome of the inscribed fragments, but without success. Nearly opposite\r\nthis place, on the Ohio side, three miles below the village of\r\nBurlington, at a point where the Ohio sweeps along the base of the\r\nsandstone cliffs, and where numerous fallen blocks line the shore, a\r\nsimilar inscribed rock once existed. It however has lately shared the\r\nfate of its neighbor on the other side of the stream. It was situated\r\nbelow the high-water mark; and its proximity to the water proved, in\r\nthe end, the cause of its destruction, as the fragments quarried off\r\ncould be easily placed on floats for transportation to the points\r\nrequired. Still another is said to have existed near the edge of\r\nthe water, at a place known as the Hanging Rock, now the site of a\r\nfurnace village, twenty-four miles above the mouth of the Scioto.\r\nIt has probably been destroyed in like manner. There is however a\r\nvery singular one still in existence a few miles above the town of\r\nPortsmouth, the southern terminus of the Ohio and Erie Canal, at the\r\nmouth of the Scioto. It consists of a colossal human [p300] head cut\r\nin outline, upon the vertical face of a large rock extending into the\r\nriver. It is always under water, except when the river is at its very\r\nlowest stages, and is not exposed oftener than once in four or five\r\nyears. It is familiarly known as the “Indian’s Head,” and is regarded\r\nas a sort of river gauge or meter. When the water-line is at the top\r\nof the head, the river is considered very low.\r\n\r\nNumerous other rocks of similar character are scattered over the\r\nWest, occurring chiefly upon or near the banks of streams. They\r\nare not however confined to the westward of the Alleghanies, but\r\nare found in several of the Atlantic States. Those at Dighton and\r\nTiverton in Massachusetts, and at Portsmouth in Rhode Island, are\r\nwell known examples. They do not seem to differ materially in\r\ncharacter from those already described.\r\n\r\nFrom an inspection and comparison of these rocks, it must be very\r\napparent that they are all the work of the same race: there is a\r\nfamily likeness in their style and workmanship, and a coincidence\r\nin position, which admits of no dispute, and seems to be conclusive\r\nupon this point. The further well known fact that the Indians\r\npossessed a system of representation, not inappropriately termed\r\n«picture-writing», by which they conveyed intelligence and recorded\r\nevents, serves still more clearly to indicate their probable\r\norigin,—especially as it is equally well known that they carved their\r\nrude pictures upon rocks as well as upon the bark of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[188] These rocks are noticed by Dr. BARTON, «Transactions of\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society», vol. iv. p. 195. He regards them as\r\n“the work of a people acquainted with the use of iron instruments, or\r\nwith hardened metallic instruments of some kind.” The engraving in\r\nthe text is from a sketch made for Mr. McBride, by J. W. Erwin, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[p301]\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIX.\r\n CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the facts presented in the foregoing chapters before him, the\r\nreader will be able to deduce his own conclusions, as to the probable\r\ncharacter and condition of the ancient population of the Mississippi\r\nvalley. That it was numerous and widely spread, is evident from the\r\nnumber and magnitude of the ancient monuments, and the extensive\r\nrange of their occurrence. That it was essentially homogeneous, in\r\ncustoms, habits, religion, and government, seems very well sustained\r\nby the great uniformity which the ancient remains display, not only\r\nas regards position and form, but in respect also to those minor\r\nparticulars, which, not less than more obvious and imposing features,\r\nassist us in arriving at correct conclusions. This opinion can be\r\nin no way affected, whether we assume that the ancient race was\r\nat one time diffused over the entire valley, or that it migrated\r\nslowly from one portion of it to the other, under the pressure of\r\nhostile neighbors or the attractions of a more genial climate. The\r\ndifferences which have already been pointed out between the monuments\r\nof the several portions of the valley, of the northern, central, and\r\nsouthern divisions, are not sufficiently marked to authorize the\r\nbelief that they were the works of separate nations. The features\r\ncommon to all are elementary, and identify them as appertaining to\r\na single grand system, owing its origin to a family of men, moving\r\nin the same general direction, acting under common impulses, and\r\ninfluenced by similar causes.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to point out the affinities, or to indicate\r\nthe probable origin of the builders of the western monuments, and\r\nthe cause of their final disappearance,—inquiries of deep interest\r\nand vast importance in an archæological and ethnological point of\r\nview, and in which it is believed the foregoing chapters may greatly\r\nassist,—we may venture to suggest that the facts thus far collected\r\npoint to a connection more or less intimate between the race of the\r\nmounds and the semi-civilized nations which formerly had their seats\r\namong the sierras of Mexico, upon the plains of Central America\r\nand Peru, and who erected the imposing structures which from their\r\nnumber, vastness, and mysterious significance, invest the central\r\nportions of the continent with an interest not less absorbing than\r\nthat which attaches to the valley of the Nile. These nations alone,\r\nof all those found in possession of the continent by the European\r\ndiscoverers, were essentially stationary and agricultural in their\r\nhabits,—conditions indispensable to large population, to fixedness\r\nof institutions, and to any considerable advance in the economical\r\nor ennobling arts. That the mound-builders, although perhaps in a\r\nless degree, were also stationary and agricultural, clearly appears\r\nfrom a variety of facts and [p302] circumstances, most of which\r\nwill no doubt recur to the mind of the reader, but which will bear\r\nrecapitulation here.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be claimed, and will be admitted without dispute,\r\nthat a large local population can only exist under an agricultural\r\nsystem. Dense commercial and manufacturing communities, the apparent\r\nexceptions to the remark, are themselves the offspring of a large\r\nagricultural population, with which nearly or remotely they are\r\nconnected, and upon which they are dependent. Now it is evident that\r\nworks of art, so numerous and vast as we have seen those of the\r\nMississippi valley to be, could only have been erected by a numerous\r\npeople,—and especially must we regard as numerous the population\r\ncapable of constructing them, when we reflect how imperfect at the\r\nbest must have been the artificial aids at their command, as compared\r\nwith those of the present age. Implements of wood, stone, and copper,\r\ncould hardly have proved very efficient auxiliaries to the builders,\r\nwho must have depended mainly upon their own bare hands and weak\r\npowers of transportation, for excavating and collecting together the\r\ntwenty millions of cubic feet of material which make up the solid\r\ncontents of the great mound at Cahokia alone.\r\n\r\nBut the conclusion that the ancient population was exceedingly\r\ndense, follows not less from the capability which they possessed to\r\nerect, than from the circumstance that they required, works of the\r\nmagnitude we have seen, to protect them in danger, or to indicate\r\nin a sufficiently imposing form their superstitious zeal, and their\r\nrespect for the dead. As observed by an eminent archæologist, whose\r\nopinions upon this and collateral subjects are entitled to a weight\r\nsecond to those of no other author, “it is impossible that the\r\npopulation, for whose protection such extensive works were necessary,\r\nand which was able to defend them, should not have been eminently\r\nagricultural.” The same author elsewhere observes, of the great mound\r\nat Grave creek, that “it indicates not only a dense agricultural\r\npopulation, but also a state of society essentially different from\r\nthat of the modern race of Indians north of the tropic. There is not,\r\nand there was not in the sixteenth century, a single tribe of Indians\r\n(north of the semi-civilized nations) between the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific, which had means of subsistence sufficient to enable them to\r\napply, for such purposes, the unproductive labor necessary for the\r\nwork; nor was there any in such a social state as to compel the labor\r\nof the people to be thus applied.”[189] [p303]\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of the probable agricultural character of the\r\nmound-builders, is furnished in the fact already several times\r\nremarked, that these remains are almost entirely confined to the\r\nfertile valleys of streams, or to productive alluvions bordering on\r\nthe lakes or on the Gulf of Mexico,—precisely the positions best\r\nadapted for agricultural purposes, and capable of sustaining the\r\ndensest population, as also affording, in fish and game, the most\r\nefficient secondary aids of support.\r\n\r\nIf the mound-builders were a numerous, stationary, and an\r\nagricultural people, it follows of necessity that their customs,\r\nlaws, and religion, had assumed a fixed and well defined form,—a\r\nresult inseparable from that condition. The construction therefore of\r\npermanent fortifications for protection against hostile neighbors,\r\nand of vast and regular religious structures, under this hypothesis,\r\nfell clearly within their capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe modes of warfare which they practised, so far as they can be\r\nmade out, and the probable state of the civil relations between them\r\nand their neighbors, and among themselves, have been noticed in the\r\nremarks on the Works of Defence, in a previous chapter. Little can,\r\nat present, be added upon these points. [p304]\r\n\r\nIf we are not mistaken in assigning a religious origin to that large\r\nportion of ancient monuments, which are clearly not defensive, nor\r\ndesigned to perpetuate the memory of the dead, then the superstitions\r\nof the ancient people must have exercised a controlling influence\r\nupon their character. If, again, as from reason and analogy we\r\nare warranted in supposing, many of these sacred structures are\r\nsymbolical in their forms and combinations, they indicate the\r\nprevalence among their builders of religious beliefs and conceptions,\r\ncorresponding with those which prevailed among the early nations\r\nof the other continent, and which in their elements seem to have\r\nbeen common to all nations, far back in the traditional period,\r\nbefore the dawn of written history. Their consideration under this\r\naspect involves a preliminary analysis of the religious belief of\r\nthe various aboriginal American families, an examination of their\r\nmythologies and superstitious rites, and a comparison between them\r\nand those of the primitive nations of the old world. It involves,\r\nalso, an attention to the sacred monuments of the eastern continent,\r\nto the principles upon which they were constructed, and to the extent\r\nto which a symbolical design is apparent in their combinations\r\nand ornaments. But it is alike beyond the scope and design of\r\nthis work to go into these inquiries, which in themselves, from\r\ntheir attractiveness and importance, deserve a full and separate\r\nconsideration. We may, however, be permitted to express the belief,\r\nthat researches in this department, philosophically conducted, must\r\nlead to results of the highest value, and greatly aid in the solution\r\nof the interesting problems connected with our aboriginal history.\r\nFor, in the words of a writer of distinction, “of all researches that\r\nmost effectually aid us to discover the origin of a nation or people,\r\nwhose history is unknown or deeply involved in the obscurity of\r\nancient times, none perhaps are attended with such important results,\r\nas the analysis of their theological dogmas, and their religious\r\npractices. In such matters mankind adhere with greatest tenacity,\r\nand though both modified and corrupted in the revolutions of ages,\r\nthey still preserve features of their original construction, when\r\nlanguage, arts, sciences, and political establishments no longer\r\nretain distinct lineaments of their ancient constitutions.”[190]\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the ancient monuments of the Mississippi valley\r\nhas been made the subject of incidental remark in the foregoing\r\nchapters. It will not be out of place here to allude once more to\r\nsome of the facts bearing upon this point. Of course no attempt to\r\nfix their date accurately can, from the circumstances of the case,\r\nbe successful. The most that can be done is to arrive at approximate\r\nresults. The fact that none of the ancient monuments occur upon the\r\nlatest-formed terraces of the river valleys of Ohio, is one of much\r\nimportance in its bearings upon this question. If, as we are amply\r\nwarranted in believing, these terraces mark the degrees of subsidence\r\nof the streams, one of the four which may be traced has been formed\r\nsince those streams have followed their present courses. There is\r\nno good reason for supposing that the mound-builders would have\r\navoided building upon that terrace, while they erected their works\r\npromiscuously upon all the others. [p305] And if they had built\r\nupon it, some slight traces of their works would yet be visible,\r\nhowever much influence we may assign to disturbing causes,—overflows,\r\nand shifting channels. Assuming, then, that the lowest terrace,\r\non the Scioto river for example, has been formed since the era of\r\nthe mounds, we must next consider that the excavating power of the\r\nWestern rivers diminishes yearly, in proportion as they approximate\r\ntowards a general level. On the lower Mississippi,—where alone the\r\nancient monuments are sometimes invaded by the water,—the bed of the\r\nstream is rising, from the deposition of the materials brought down\r\nfrom the upper tributaries, where the excavating process is going\r\non. This excavating power, it is calculated, is in an inverse ratio\r\nto the square of the depth, that is to say, diminishes as the square\r\nof the depth increases. Taken to be approximately correct, this\r\nrule establishes that the formation of the latest terrace, by the\r\noperation of the same causes, must have occupied much more time than\r\nthe formation of any of the preceding three. Upon these premises, the\r\ntime, since the streams have flowed in their present courses, may be\r\ndivided into four periods, of different lengths,—of which the latest,\r\nsupposed to have elapsed since the race of the mounds flourished, is\r\nmuch the longest.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the rivers, in shifting their channels, have in some\r\ninstances encroached upon the superior terraces, so as in part to\r\ndestroy works situated upon them, and afterwards receded to long\r\ndistances of a fourth or half a mile or upwards, is one which should\r\nnot be overlooked in this connection. (See pages 50, 60, and 89.)\r\nIn the case of the “High Bank Works,” Plate XVI, the recession has\r\nbeen nearly three fourths of a mile, and the intervening terrace or\r\n“bottom” was, at the period of the early settlement, covered with\r\na dense forest. This recession, and subsequent forest growth, must\r\nof necessity have taken place since the river encroached upon the\r\nancient works here alluded to.\r\n\r\nWithout doing more than to allude to the circumstance of the\r\nexceedingly decayed state of the skeletons found in the mounds,\r\n(see page 168,) and to the amount of vegetable accumulations in\r\nthe ancient excavations, and around the ancient works, (see pages\r\n55 and 90,) we pass to another fact, perhaps more important in its\r\nbearing upon the question of the antiquity of these works than any\r\nof those presented above. It is that they are covered with primitive\r\nforests, in no way distinguishable from those which surround them,\r\nin places where it is probable no clearings were ever made. Some\r\nof the trees of these forests have a positive antiquity of from\r\nsix to eight hundred years (see pages 14 and 16). They are found\r\nsurrounded with the mouldering remains of others, undoubtedly of\r\nequal original dimensions, but now fallen and almost incorporated\r\nwith the soil. Allow a reasonable time for the encroachment of the\r\nforest, after the works were abandoned by their builders, and for\r\nthe period intervening between that event and the date of their\r\nconstruction, and we are compelled to assign them no inconsiderable\r\nantiquity. But, as already observed, the forests covering these works\r\ncorrespond in all respects with the surrounding forests; the same\r\nvarieties of trees are found, in the same proportions, and they have\r\na like primitive aspect. This fact was remarked by the late President\r\nHARRISON, and was put forward by him as one of [p306] the strongest\r\nevidences of the high antiquity of these works. In an address before\r\nthe Historical Society of Ohio, he said:\r\n\r\n“The process by which nature restores the forest to its original\r\nstate, after being once cleared, is extremely slow. The rich lands of\r\nthe West are, indeed, soon covered again, but the character of the\r\ngrowth is entirely different, and continues so for a long period.\r\nIn several places upon the Ohio, and upon the farm which I occupy,\r\nclearings were made in the first settlement of the country and\r\nsubsequently abandoned and suffered to grow up. Some of these new\r\nforests are now sure of fifty years’ growth, but they have made so\r\nlittle progress towards attaining the appearance of the immediately\r\ncontiguous forest, as to induce any man of reflection to determine\r\nthat at least ten times fifty years must elapse before their complete\r\nassimilation can be effected. We find in the ancient works all that\r\nvariety of trees which give such unrivalled beauty to our forests,\r\nin natural proportions. The first growth on the same kind of land,\r\nonce cleared and then abandoned to nature, on the contrary, is nearly\r\nhomogeneous, often stinted to one or two, at most three kinds of\r\ntimber. If the ground has been cultivated, the yellow locust will\r\nthickly spring up; if not cultivated, the black and white walnut will\r\nbe the prevailing growth. * * * Of what immense age then must be\r\nthe works so often referred to, covered as they are by at least the\r\nsecond growth, after the primitive forest state was regained?”\r\n\r\nIt is not undertaken to assign a period for the assimilation here\r\nindicated to take place. It must unquestionably, however, be measured\r\nby centuries.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the extent of territory occupied at one time, or at\r\nsuccessive periods, by the race of the mounds, so far as indicated by\r\nthe occurrence of their monuments, little need be said in addition to\r\nthe observations presented in the first chapter. It cannot, however,\r\nhave escaped notice, that the relics found in the mounds,—composed\r\nof materials peculiar to places separated as widely as the ranges\r\nof the Alleghanies on the east, and the Sierras of Mexico on the\r\nwest, the waters of the great lakes on the north, and those of the\r\nGulf of Mexico on the south,—denote the contemporaneous existence\r\nof communication between these extremes. For we find, side by\r\nside in the same mounds, native copper from Lake Superior, mica\r\nfrom the Alleghanies, shells from the Gulf, and obsidian (perhaps\r\nporphyry) from Mexico. This fact seems seriously to conflict with the\r\nhypothesis of a migration, either northward or southward. Further\r\nand more extended investigations and observations may, nevertheless,\r\nserve satisfactorily to settle not only this, but other equally\r\ninteresting questions connected with the extinct race, whose name is\r\nlost to tradition itself, and whose very existence is left to the\r\nsole and silent attestation of the rude but often imposing monuments\r\nwhich throng the valleys of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[189] GALLATIN’S “Notes on the semi-civilized nations of Mexico,”\r\n«Transactions of American Ethnological Society», vol. i. p. 207.\r\n\r\nMr. Gallatin, in the memoir here quoted, has discussed at\r\nconsiderable length the question of the origin of agriculture among\r\nthe American nations. His views, altogether the most philosophical\r\nof any hitherto presented on the subject, may not be without their\r\ninterest in this connection. It should be observed, at the outset,\r\nthat Mr. Gallatin is of the opinion, not only that agriculture on\r\nthis continent was of domestic origin, but also that it originated\r\nbetween the tropics,—spreading thence in different directions to the\r\nnorth and south. The evidence in support of the latter conclusion is\r\nnot presented in sufficient detail to enable us to judge how well\r\nsustained it may be. If we admit its correctness, we must derive\r\nthe agriculture of the mound-builders from the south, and assign\r\nthat race chronologically a comparatively low date. This we are not\r\nyet prepared to do; on the contrary, there are many facts going to\r\nestablish for the mound-builders very high antiquity, and tending to\r\nthe conclusion that the degree of civilization which they possessed\r\nwas attained by a course of development in the Mississippi valley.\r\nIt is not impossible that future investigations may show that the\r\nagriculture and civilization of the Mexicans, Central Americans, and\r\nPeruvians, had its origin among the builders of the ancient monuments\r\non the banks of the great Mississippi river,—the Nile and the Ganges\r\nof North America.\r\n\r\n“What was the first indispensable transition which withdrew a\r\ncertain portion of the aborigines of America from the barbarism and\r\nignorance in which all the other tribes are still found? That it was\r\nthe transition from the hunter to the agricultural state, no one\r\ncan doubt. It is true some of the tribes among whom agriculture was\r\nintroduced, are still savages; but not an instance exists in America\r\nof a nation, either populous or to a certain extent civilized,\r\nwhich is not agricultural. * * * * We are then led to inquire how\r\nagriculture was introduced into America, and whether it was imported\r\nor of domestic origin.\r\n\r\n“We have here two leading facts, one positively ascertained, and the\r\nother generally admitted by those who have inquired into the subject,\r\nthe importance of which has not, it seems to me, been adverted to.\r\n\r\n“The first is that all those nutritious plants cultivated in the\r\nother hemisphere, and which are usually distinguished by the name\r\nof cereals (millet, rice, wheat, rye, barley, oats), were entirely\r\nunknown to the Americans.\r\n\r\n“The second is that maize, which was the great and almost sole\r\nfoundation of American agriculture, is exclusively of American\r\norigin, and was not known in the other hemisphere till after the\r\ndiscovery of America, in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n“If these two facts be admitted, it necessarily follows that the\r\nintroduction of agriculture,—that first, difficult, and indispensable\r\npreliminary step before any advance whatever can be made towards\r\ncivilization,—originated in America itself; that it was not imported\r\nfrom abroad; and that it was the result of the natural progress from\r\nbarbarism to a more refined social state by the race of red men,\r\ninsulated, left to themselves, and without any aid or communication\r\nfrom any foreign country. It is therefore highly important for\r\na correct view of the history of man, that the presumed fact of\r\nmaize being exclusively an American plant, should be thoroughly\r\ninvestigated. * * * If a domestic origin is admitted, it is quite\r\nnatural that agriculture should have had its birth in the most genial\r\nclimate, and in the native country of the maize.”—«Transactions of\r\nAmerican Ethnological Society», vol. i. p. 192.\r\n\r\nWhat climate more genial, and what soil better adapted to the\r\ncultivation of maize, in its perfection, than those portions of the\r\nMississippi valley where the evidences of ancient civilization are\r\nmost abundant and imposing?\r\n\r\n[190] MCCULLOH, «Philosophical and Antiquarian Researches», p. 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n TRANSCRIBER’S ENDNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal printed spelling and grammar are retained, with most\r\nexceptions noted below. Small caps are changed to all capital\r\nletters. Italics «look like this». Many illustrations have been moved\r\nfrom their original locations to nearby places between paragraphs.\r\n\r\nDitto marks—including text equivalents “Do.”, “Do”, or “do”—do\r\nnot work well in electronic books, except in special circumstances.\r\nTherefore original ditto marks have generally been replaced with the\r\nappropriate repeated text. Sometimes in tables, such as those on page\r\n113, new column headings were inserted to replace ditto marks.\r\n\r\nThe original List of Plates was printed in very small type, and is\r\ntoo wide for this ebook edition. It has been split into two tables,\r\n«List of Plates» and «Plates Supplemental Data». Plates in the\r\noriginal book had no captions. Herein, captions have been provided,\r\nbased upon comparison of the List of Plates with information\r\ncontained in the illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe original caption to Fig. 1 was printed with a footnote anchor,\r\non the same page with its footnote. In this edition, the text of the\r\nfootnote is moved into the caption, and the footnote was eliminated.\r\nFig. 194, on page 275 was handled similarly. Footnotes not anchored\r\nin captions are renumbered and moved to the ends of chapters.\r\n\r\nPage 32. Comma was added between “south” and “which”, in the sentence\r\n“South of the bluff. . . the wall fronting the south which wall also\r\nextends . . . wall.”\r\n\r\nPage 37, Plate V. The List of Plates shows eight separate figures\r\nas part of this plate, but only three, Nos. 1–3 were shown as part\r\nof a plate. Plate V., Nos. 4–8 are evidently the same as Figs. 4–8,\r\npp 39–40. So these five illustrations are listed twice (perhaps\r\nerroneously?) in the front matter, under different headings.\r\n\r\nPage 85. There were two identical footnote anchors, both pointing to\r\none footnote. In this edition, the footnote has been duplicated, and\r\nthe footnote anchors made independent.\r\n\r\nPage 200. “One of them, now in the possession of a gentleman of\r\nHillsboro’, is of the . . .” is retained despite the odd single\r\nquotation mark.\r\n\r\nPage 240. The footnote begins: “Humboldt states that the «Guaynares»\r\nof the Rio Caura . . .”, maybe. The spelling of «Guaynares» is\r\nunclear.\r\n\r\nPage 280. The phrase “an open cut mas made” was changed to “an open\r\ncut was made”.\r\n\r\nPages 291, 292. The two very large tables were printed full page.\r\nThey have been edited considerably and divided for this edition.\r\n\r\nPage 300. Changed “river guage” to “river gauge”.",
