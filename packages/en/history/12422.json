I return you Mr. ----'s letter. I do not think it answers\r\nany of the questions debated in our last conversation at all\r\nsatisfactorily: the _right_ one man has to enslave another, he has not the\r\nhardihood to assert; but in the reasons he adduces to defend that act of\r\ninjustice, the contradictory statements he makes appear to me to refute\r\neach other. He says, that to the continental European protesting against\r\nthe abstract iniquity of slavery, his answer would be, 'the slaves are\r\ninfinitely better off than half the continental peasantry.' To the\r\nEnglishman, 'they are happy compared with the miserable Irish.' But\r\nsupposing that this answered the question of original injustice, which it\r\ndoes not, it is not a true reply. Though the negroes are fed, clothed, and\r\nhoused, and though the Irish peasant is starved, naked, and roofless, the\r\nbare name of freeman--the lordship over his own person, the power to\r\nchoose and will--are blessings beyond food, raiment, or shelter;\r\npossessing which, the want of every comfort of life is yet more tolerable\r\nthan their fullest enjoyment without them. Ask the thousands of ragged\r\ndestitutes who yearly land upon these shores to seek the means of\r\nexistence--ask the friendless, penniless foreign emigrant, if he will give\r\nup his present misery, his future uncertainty, his doubtful and difficult\r\nstruggle for life, at once, for the secure, and as it is called, fortunate\r\ndependance of the slave: the indignation with which he would spurn the\r\noffer will prove that he possesses one good beyond all others, and that\r\nhis birthright as a man is more precious to him yet than the mess of\r\npottage for which he is told to exchange it because he is starving.\r\n\r\nOf course the reverse alternative cannot be offered to the slaves, for\r\nat the very word the riches of those who own them would make themselves\r\nwings and flee away. But I do not admit the comparison between your\r\nslaves and even the lowest class of European free labourers, for the\r\nformer are _allowed_ the exercise of no faculties but those which they\r\nenjoy in common with the brutes that perish. The just comparison is\r\nbetween the slaves and the useful animals to whose level your laws\r\nreduce them; and I will acknowledge that the slaves of a kind owner may\r\nbe as well cared for, and as happy, as the dogs and horses of a merciful\r\nmaster; but the latter condition--i.e. that of happiness--must again\r\ndepend upon the complete perfection of their moral and mental\r\ndegradation. Mr. ----, in his letter, maintains that they _are_ an\r\ninferior race, and, compared with the whites, '_animals_, incapable of\r\nmental culture and moral improvement:' to this I can only reply, that if\r\nthey are incapable of profiting by instruction, I do not see the\r\nnecessity for laws inflicting heavy penalties on those who offer it to\r\nthem. If they really are brutish, witless, dull, and devoid of capacity\r\nfor progress, where lies the _danger_ which is constantly insisted upon\r\nof offering them that of which they are incapable. We have no laws\r\nforbidding us to teach our dogs and horses as much as they can\r\ncomprehend; nobody is fined or imprisoned for reasoning upon knowledge,\r\nand liberty, to the beasts of the field, for they are incapable of such\r\ntruths. But these themes are forbidden to slaves, not because they\r\ncannot, but because they can and would seize on them with\r\navidity--receive them gladly, comprehend them quickly; and the masters'\r\npower over them would be annihilated at once and for ever. But I have\r\nmore frequently heard, not that they were incapable of receiving\r\ninstruction, but something much nearer the truth--that knowledge only\r\nmakes them miserable: the moment they are in any degree enlightened,\r\nthey become unhappy. In the letter I return to you Mr. ---- says that\r\nthe very slightest amount of education, merely teaching them to read,\r\n'impairs their value as slaves, for it instantly destroys their\r\ncontentedness, and since you do not contemplate changing their\r\ncondition, it is surely doing them an ill service to destroy their\r\nacquiescence in it;' but this is a very different ground of argument\r\nfrom the other. The discontent they evince upon the mere dawn of an\r\nadvance in intelligence proves not only that they can acquire but\r\ncombine ideas, a process to which it is very difficult to assign a\r\nlimit; and there indeed the whole question lies, and there and nowhere\r\nelse the shoe really pinches. A slave is ignorant; he eats, drinks,\r\nsleeps, labours, and is happy. He learns to read; he feels, thinks,\r\nreflects, and becomes miserable. He discovers himself to be one of a\r\ndebased and degraded race, deprived of the elementary rights which God\r\nhas granted to all men alike; every action is controlled, every word\r\nnoted; he may not stir beyond his appointed bounds, to the right hand or\r\nto the left, at his own will, but at the will of another he may be sent\r\nmiles and miles of weary journeying--tethered, yoked, collared, and\r\nfettered--away from whatever he may know as home, severed from all those\r\nties of blood and affection which he alone of all human, of all living\r\ncreatures on the face of the earth may neither enjoy in peace nor defend\r\nwhen they are outraged. If he is well treated, if his master be\r\ntolerably humane or even understand his own interest tolerably, this is\r\nprobably _all_ he may have to endure: it is only to the consciousness of\r\nthese evils that knowledge and reflection awaken him. But how is it if\r\nhis master be severe, harsh, cruel--or even only careless--leaving his\r\ncreatures to the delegated dominion of some overseer, or agent, whose\r\nlove of power, or other evil dispositions, are checked by no\r\nconsiderations of personal interest? Imagination shrinks from the\r\npossible result of such a state of things; nor must you, or Mr. ----,\r\ntell me that the horrors thus suggested exist only in imagination. The\r\nSouthern newspapers, with their advertisements of negro sales and\r\npersonal descriptions of fugitive slaves, supply details of misery that\r\nit would be difficult for imagination to exceed. Scorn, derision,\r\ninsult, menace--the handcuff, the lash--the tearing away of children\r\nfrom parents, of husbands from wives--the weary trudging in droves along\r\nthe common highways, the labour of body, the despair of mind, the\r\nsickness of heart--these are the realities which belong to the system,\r\nand form the rule, rather than the exception, in the slave's experience.\r\nAnd this system exists here in this country of your's, which boasts\r\nitself the asylum of the oppressed, the home of freedom, the one place\r\nin all the world where all men may find enfranchisement from all\r\nthraldoms of mind, soul, or body--the land elect of liberty.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- lays great stress, as a proof of the natural inferiority of the\r\nblacks, on the little comparative progress they have made in those States\r\nwhere they enjoy their freedom, and the fact that, whatever quickness of\r\nparts they may exhibit while very young, on attaining maturity they\r\ninvariably sink again into inferiority, or at least mediocrity, and\r\nindolence. But surely there are other causes to account for this besides\r\nnatural deficiency, which must, I think, be obvious to any unprejudiced\r\nperson observing the condition of the free blacks in your Northern\r\ncommunities. If, in the early portion of their life, they escape the\r\ncontempt and derision of their white associates--if the blessed\r\nunconsciousness and ignorance of childhood keeps them for a few years\r\nunaware of the conventional proscription under which their whole race is\r\nplaced (and it is difficult to walk your streets, and mark the tone of\r\ninsolent superiority assumed by even the gutter-urchins over their dusky\r\ncotemporaries, and imagine this possible)--as soon as they acquire the\r\nfirst rudiments of knowledge, as soon as they begin to grow up and pass\r\nfrom infancy to youth, as soon as they cast the first observing glance\r\nupon the world by which they are surrounded, and the society of which,\r\nthey are members, they must become conscious that they are marked as the\r\nHebrew lepers of old, and are condemned to sit, like those unfortunates,\r\nwithout the gates of every human and social sympathy. From their own sable\r\ncolour, a pall falls over the whole of God's universe to them, and they\r\nfind themselves stamped with a badge of infamy of Nature's own devising,\r\nat sight of which all natural kindliness of man to man seems to recoil\r\nfrom them. They are not slaves indeed, but they are pariahs; debarred from\r\nall fellowship save with their own despised race--scorned by the lowest\r\nwhite ruffian in your streets, not tolerated as companions even by the\r\nforeign menials in your kitchen. They are free certainly, but they are\r\nalso degraded, rejected, the offscum and the offscouring of the very dregs\r\nof your society; they are free from the chain, the whip, the enforced task\r\nand unpaid toil of slavery; but they are not the less under a ban. Their\r\nkinship with slaves for ever bars them from a full share of the freeman's\r\ninheritance of equal rights, and equal consideration and respect. All\r\nhands are extended to thrust them out, all fingers point at their dusky\r\nskin, all tongues--the most vulgar, as well as the self-styled most\r\nrefined--have learnt to turn the very name of their race into an insult\r\nand a reproach. How, in the name of all that is natural, probable,\r\npossible, should the spirit and energy of any human creature support\r\nitself under such an accumulation of injustice and obloquy? Where shall\r\nany mass of men be found with power of character and mind sufficient to\r\nbear up against such a weight of prejudice? Why, if one individual rarely\r\ngifted by heaven were to raise himself out of such a slough of despond, he\r\nwould be a miracle; and what would be his reward? Would he be admitted to\r\nan equal share in your political rights?--would he ever be allowed to\r\ncross the threshold of your doors?--would any of you give your daughter to\r\nhis son, or your son to his daughter?--would you, in any one particular,\r\nadmit him to the footing of equality which any man with a white skin would\r\nclaim, whose ability and worth had so raised him from the lower degrees of\r\nthe social scale. You would turn from such propositions with abhorrence,\r\nand the servants in your kitchen and stable--the ignorant and boorish\r\nrefuse of foreign populations, in whose countries no such prejudice\r\nexists, imbibing it with the very air they breathe here--would shrink from\r\neating at the same table with such a man, or holding out the hand of\r\ncommon fellowship to him. Under the species of social proscription in\r\nwhich the blacks in your Northern cities exist, if they preserved energy\r\nof mind, enterprise of spirit, or any of the best attributes and powers of\r\nfree men, they would prove themselves, instead of the lowest and least of\r\nhuman races, the highest and first, not only of all that do exist, but of\r\nall that ever have existed; for they alone would seek and cultivate\r\nknowledge, goodness, truth, science, art, refinement, and all improvement,\r\npurely for the sake of their own excellence, and without one of those\r\nincentives of honour, power, and fortune, which are found to be the chief,\r\ntoo often the only, inducements which lead white men to the pursuit of the\r\nsame objects.\r\n\r\nYou know very well dear E----, that in speaking of the free blacks of the\r\nNorth I here state nothing but what is true and of daily experience. Only\r\nlast week I heard, in this very town of Philadelphia, of a family of\r\nstrict probity and honour, highly principled, intelligent, well-educated,\r\nand accomplished, and (to speak the world's language) respectable in every\r\nway--i.e. _rich_. Upon an English lady's stating it to be her intention to\r\nvisit these persons when she came to Philadelphia, she was told that if\r\nshe did nobody else would visit _her_; and she probably would excite a\r\nmalevolent feeling, which might find vent in some violent demonstration\r\nagainst this family. All that I have now said of course bears only upon\r\nthe condition of the free coloured population of the North, with which I\r\nam familiar enough to speak confidently of it. As for the slaves, and\r\ntheir capacity for progress, I can say nothing, for I have never been\r\namong them to judge what faculties their unhappy social position leaves to\r\nthem unimpaired. But it seems to me, that no experiment on a sufficiently\r\nlarge scale can have been tried for a sufficient length of time to\r\ndetermine the question of their incurable inferiority. Physiologists say\r\nthat three successive generations appear to be necessary to produce an\r\neffectual change of constitution (bodily and mental), be it for health or\r\ndisease. There are positive physical defects which produce positive mental\r\nones; the diseases of the muscular and nervous systems descend from father\r\nto son. Upon the agency of one corporal power how much that is not\r\ncorporal depends; from generation to generation internal disease and\r\nexternal deformity, vices, virtues, talents, and deficiencies are\r\ntransmitted, and by the action of the same law it must be long indeed\r\nbefore the offspring of slaves--creatures begotten of a race debased and\r\ndegraded to the lowest degree, themselves born in slavery, and whose\r\nprogenitors have eaten the bread and drawn the breath of slavery for\r\nyears--can be measured, with any show of justice, by even the least\r\nfavoured descendants of European nations, whose qualities have been for\r\ncenturies developing themselves under the beneficent influence of freedom,\r\nand the progress it inspires.\r\n\r\nI am rather surprised at the outbreak of violent disgust which Mr. ----\r\nindulges in on the subject of amalgamation; as that formed no part of\r\nour discussion, and seems to me a curious subject for abstract argument. I\r\nshould think the intermarrying between blacks and whites a matter to be as\r\nlittle insisted upon if repugnant, as prevented if agreeable to the\r\nmajority of the two races. At the same time, I cannot help being\r\nastonished at the furious and ungoverned execration which all reference to\r\nthe possibility of a fusion of the races draws down upon those who suggest\r\nit; because nobody pretends to deny that, throughout the South, a large\r\nproportion of the population is the offspring of white men and coloured\r\nwomen. In New Orleans, a class of unhappy females exists whose mingled\r\nblood does not prevent their being remarkable for their beauty, and with\r\nwhom no man, no _gentleman_, in that city shrinks from associating; and\r\nwhile the slaveowners of the Southern States insist vehemently upon the\r\nmental and physical inferiority of the blacks, they are benevolently doing\r\ntheir best, in one way at least, to raise and improve the degraded race,\r\nand the bastard population which forms so ominous an element in the social\r\nsafety of their cities certainly exhibit in their forms and features the\r\nbenefit they derive from their white progenitors. It is hard to conceive\r\nthat some mental improvement does not accompany this physical change.\r\nAlready the finer forms of the European races are cast in these dusky\r\nmoulds: the outward configuration can hardly thus improve without\r\ncorresponding progress in the inward capacities. The white man's blood and\r\nbones have begotten this bronze race, and bequeathed to it in some degree\r\nqualities, tendencies, capabilities, such as are the inheritance of the\r\nhighest order of human animals. Mr. ---- (and many others) speaks as if\r\nthere were a natural repugnance in all whites to any alliance with the\r\nblack race; and yet it is notorious, that almost every Southern planter\r\nhas a family more or less numerous of illegitimate coloured children. Most\r\ncertainly, few people would like to assert that such connections are\r\nformed because it is the _interest_ of these planters to increase the\r\nnumber of their human property, and that they add to their revenue by the\r\nclosest intimacy with creatures that they loathe, in order to reckon\r\namong their wealth the children of their body. Surely that is a monstrous\r\nand unnatural supposition, and utterly unworthy of belief. That such\r\nconnections exist commonly, is a sufficient proof that they are not\r\nabhorrent to nature; but it seems, indeed, as if marriage (and not\r\nconcubinage) was the horrible enormity which cannot be tolerated, and\r\nagainst which, moreover, it has been deemed expedient to enact laws. Now\r\nit appears very evident that there is no law in the white man's nature\r\nwhich prevents him from making a coloured woman the mother of his\r\nchildren, but there _is_ a law on his statute books forbidding him to make\r\nher his wife; and if we are to admit the theory that the mixing of the\r\nraces is a monstrosity, it seems almost as curious that laws should be\r\nenacted to prevent men marrying women towards whom they have an invincible\r\nnatural repugnance, as that education should by law be prohibited to\r\ncreatures incapable of receiving it. As for the exhortation with which\r\nMr. ---- closes his letter, that I will not 'go down to my husband's\r\nplantation prejudiced against what I am to find there,' I know not well\r\nhow to answer it. Assuredly I _am_ going prejudiced against slavery, for I\r\nam an Englishwoman, in whom the absence of such a prejudice would be\r\ndisgraceful. Nevertheless, I go prepared to find many mitigations in the\r\npractice to the general injustice and cruelty of the system--much kindness\r\non the part of the masters, much content on that of the slaves; and I feel\r\nvery sure that you may rely upon the carefulness of my observation, and\r\nthe accuracy of my report, of every detail of the working of the thing\r\nthat comes under my notice; and certainly, on the plantation to which I am\r\ngoing, it will be more likely that I should some things extenuate, than\r\nset down aught in malice.\r\n\r\nYours ever faithfully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDarien, Georgia.\r\n\r\nDear E----. Minuteness of detail, and fidelity in the account of my daily\r\ndoings, will hardly, I fear, render my letters very interesting to you\r\nnow; but cut off as I am here from all the usual resources and amusements\r\nof civilised existence, I shall find but little to communicate to you that\r\nis not furnished by my observations on the novel appearance of external\r\nnature, and the moral and physical condition of Mr. ----'s people. The\r\nlatter subject is, I know, one sufficiently interesting in itself to you,\r\nand I shall not scruple to impart all the reflections which may occur to\r\nme relative to their state during my stay here, where enquiry into their\r\nmode of existence will form my chief occupation, and, necessarily also,\r\nthe staple commodity of my letters. I purpose, while I reside here,\r\nkeeping a sort of journal, such as Monk Lewis wrote during his visit to\r\nhis West India plantations. I wish I had any prospect of rendering my\r\ndiary as interesting and amusing to you as his was to me.\r\n\r\nIn taking my first walk on the island, I directed my steps towards the\r\nrice mill, a large building on the banks of the river, within a few yards\r\nof the house we occupy. Is it not rather curious that Miss Martineau\r\nshould have mentioned the erection of a steam mill for threshing rice\r\nsomewhere in the vicinity of Charleston as a singular novelty, likely to\r\nform an era in Southern agriculture, and to produce the most desirable\r\nchanges in the system of labour by which it is carried on? Now, on this\r\nestate alone, there are three threshing mills--one worked by steam, one by\r\nthe tide, and one by horses; there are two private steam mills on\r\nplantations adjacent to ours, and a public one at Savannah, where the\r\nplanters who have none on their own estates are in the habit of sending\r\ntheir rice to be threshed at a certain percentage; these have all been in\r\noperation for some years, and I therefore am at a loss to understand what\r\nmade her hail the erection of the one at Charleston as likely to produce\r\nsuch immediate and happy results. By the bye--of the misstatements, or\r\nrather mistakes, for they are such, in her books, with regard to certain\r\nfacts--her only disadvantage in acquiring information was not by any means\r\nthat natural infirmity on which the periodical press, both here and in\r\nEngland, has commented with so much brutality. She had the misfortune to\r\npossess, too, that unsuspecting reliance upon the truth of others which\r\nthey are apt to feel who themselves hold truth most sacred: and this was\r\na sore disadvantage to her in a country where I have heard it myself\r\nrepeatedly asserted--and, what is more, much gloried in--that she was\r\npurposely misled by the persons to whom she addressed her enquiries, who\r\ndid not scruple to disgrace themselves by imposing in the grossest manner\r\nupon her credulity and anxiety to obtain information. It is a knowledge of\r\nthis very shameful proceeding, which has made me most especially anxious\r\nto avoid _fact hunting_. I might fill my letters to you with accounts\r\nreceived from others, but as I am aware of the risk which I run in so\r\ndoing, I shall furnish you with no details but those which come under my\r\nown immediate observation. To return to the rice mill: it is worked by a\r\nsteam-engine of thirty horse power, and besides threshing great part of\r\nour own rice, is kept constantly employed by the neighbouring planters,\r\nwho send their grain to it in preference to the more distant mill at\r\nSavannah, paying, of course, the same percentage, which makes it a very\r\nprofitable addition to the estate. Immediately opposite to this building\r\nis a small shed, which they call the cook's shop, and where the daily\r\nallowance of rice and corn grits of the people is boiled and distributed\r\nto them by an old woman, whose special business this is. There are four\r\nsettlements or villages (or, as the negroes call them, camps) on the\r\nisland, consisting of from ten to twenty houses, and to each settlement is\r\nannexed a cook's shop with capacious cauldrons, and the oldest wife of\r\nthe settlement for officiating priestess. Pursuing my walk along the\r\nriver's bank, upon an artificial dyke, sufficiently high and broad to\r\nprotect the fields from inundation by the ordinary rising of the tide--for\r\nthe whole island is below high water mark--I passed the blacksmith's and\r\ncooper's shops. At the first all the common iron implements of husbandry\r\nor household use for the estate are made, and at the latter all the rice\r\nbarrels necessary for the crop, besides tubs and buckets large and small\r\nfor the use of the people, and cedar tubs of noble dimensions and\r\nexceedingly neat workmanship, for our own household purposes. The\r\nfragrance of these when they are first made, as well as their ample size,\r\nrenders them preferable as dressing-room furniture, in my opinion, to all\r\nthe china foot-tubs that ever came out of Staffordshire. After this I got\r\nout of the vicinity of the settlement, and pursued my way along a narrow\r\ndyke--the river on one hand, and on the other a slimy, poisonous-looking\r\nswamp, all rattling with sedges of enormous height, in which one might\r\nlose one's way as effectually as in a forest of oaks. Beyond this, the low\r\nrice-fields, all clothed in their rugged stubble, divided by dykes into\r\nmonotonous squares, a species of prospect by no means beautiful to the\r\nmere lover of the picturesque. The only thing that I met with to attract\r\nmy attention was a most beautiful species of ivy, the leaf longer and more\r\ngraceful than that of the common English creeper, glittering with the\r\nhighest varnish, delicately veined, and of a rich brown green, growing in\r\nprofuse garlands from branch to branch of some stunted evergreen bushes\r\nwhich border the dyke, and which the people call salt-water bush. My walks\r\nare rather circumscribed, inasmuch as the dykes are the only promenades.\r\nOn all sides of these lie either the marshy rice-fields, the brimming\r\nriver, or the swampy patches of yet unreclaimed forest, where the huge\r\ncypress trees and exquisite evergreen undergrowth spring up from a\r\nstagnant sweltering pool, that effectually forbids the foot of the\r\nexplorer.\r\n\r\nAs I skirted one of these thickets to-day, I stood still to admire the\r\nbeauty of the shrubbery. Every shade of green, every variety of form,\r\nevery degree of varnish, and all in full leaf and beauty in the very depth\r\nof winter. The stunted dark-coloured oak; the magnolia bay (like our own\r\nculinary and fragrant bay), which grows to a very great size; the wild\r\nmyrtle, a beautiful and profuse shrub, rising to a height of six, eight,\r\nand ten feet, and branching on all sides in luxuriant tufted fullness;\r\nmost beautiful of all, that pride of the South, the magnolia grandiflora,\r\nwhose lustrous dark green perfect foliage would alone render it an object\r\nof admiration, without the queenly blossom whose colour, size, and perfume\r\nare unrivalled in the whole vegetable kingdom. This last magnificent\r\ncreature grows to the size of a forest tree in these swamps, but seldom\r\nadorns a high or dry soil, or suffers itself to be successfully\r\ntransplanted. Under all these the spiked palmetto forms an impenetrable\r\ncovert, and from glittering graceful branch to branch hang garlands of\r\nevergreen creepers, on which the mocking-birds are swinging and singing\r\neven now; while I, bethinking me of the pinching cold that is at this hour\r\ntyrannising over your region, look round on this strange scene--on these\r\ngreen woods, this unfettered river, and sunny sky--and feel very much like\r\none in another planet from yourself.\r\n\r\nThe profusion of birds here is one thing that strikes me as curious,\r\ncoming from the vicinity of Philadelphia, where even the robin redbreast,\r\nheld sacred by the humanity of all other Christian people, is not safe\r\nfrom the _gunning_ prowess of the unlicensed sportsmen of your free\r\ncountry. The negroes (of course) are not allowed the use of firearms, and\r\ntheir very simply constructed traps do not do much havoc among the\r\nfeathered hordes that haunt their rice-fields. Their case is rather a hard\r\none, as partridges, snipes, and the most delicious wild ducks abound here,\r\nand their allowance of rice and Indian meal would not be the worse for\r\nsuch additions. No day passes that I do not, in the course of my walk, put\r\nup a number of the land birds, and startle from among the gigantic sedges\r\nthe long-necked water-fowl by dozens. It arouses the killing propensity in\r\nme most dreadfully, and I really entertain serious thoughts of learning to\r\nuse a gun, for the mere pleasure of destroying these pretty birds as they\r\nwhirr from their secret coverts close beside my path. How strong an\r\ninstinct of animal _humanity_ this is, and how strange if one be more\r\nstrange than another. Reflection rebukes it almost instantaneously, and\r\nyet for the life of me I cannot help wishing I had a fowling-piece\r\nwhenever I put up a covey of these creatures; though I suppose, if one\r\nwere brought bleeding and maimed to me, I should begin to cry, and be very\r\npathetic, after the fashion of Jacques. However, one must live, you know;\r\nand here our living consists very mainly of wild ducks, wild geese, wild\r\nturkeys, and venison. Nor, perhaps, can one imagine the universal doom\r\novertaking a creature with less misery than in the case of the bird who,\r\nin the very moment of his triumphant soaring, is brought dead to the\r\nground. I should like to bargain for such a finis myself, amazingly, I\r\nknow; and have always thought that the death I should prefer would be to\r\nbreak my neck off the back of my horse at a full gallop on a fine day. Of\r\ncourse a bad shot should be hung--a man who shatters his birds' wings and\r\nlegs; if I undertook the trade, I would learn of some Southern duellist,\r\nand always shoot my bird through the head or heart--as an expert murderer\r\nknows how. Besides these birds of which we make our prey, there are others\r\nthat prey upon their own fraternity. Hawks of every sort and size wheel\r\ntheir steady rounds above the rice-fields; and the great turkey\r\nbuzzards--those most unsightly carrion birds--spread their broad black\r\nwings, and soar over the river like so many mock eagles. I do not know\r\nthat I ever saw any winged creature of so forbidding an aspect as these\r\nsame turkey buzzards; their heavy flight, their awkward gait, their\r\nbald-looking head and neck, and their devotion to every species of foul\r\nand detestable food, render them almost abhorrent to me. They abound in\r\nthe South, and in Charleston are held in especial veneration for their\r\nscavenger-like propensities, killing one of them being, I believe, a\r\nfineable offence by the city police regulations. Among the Brobdignagian\r\nsedges that in some parts of the island fringe the Altamaha, the\r\nnightshade (apparently the same as the European creeper) weaves a perfect\r\nmatting of its poisonous garlands, and my remembrance of its prevalence in\r\nthe woods and hedges of England did not reconcile me to its appearance\r\nhere. How much of this is mere association I cannot tell; but whether the\r\nwild duck makes its nest under its green arches, or the alligators and\r\nsnakes of the Altamaha have their secret bowers there, it is an\r\nevil-looking weed, and I shall have every leaf of it cleared away.\r\n\r\nI must inform you of a curious conversation which took place between my\r\nlittle girl and the woman who performs for us the offices of chambermaid\r\nhere--of course one of Mr. ----'s slaves. What suggested it to the child,\r\nor whence indeed she gathered her information, I know not; but children\r\nare made of eyes and ears, and nothing, however minute, escapes their\r\nmicroscopic observation. She suddenly began addressing this woman. 'Mary,\r\nsome persons are free and some are not (the woman made no reply). I am a\r\nfree person (of a little more than three years old). I say, I am a free\r\nperson, Mary--do you know that?' 'Yes, missis.' 'Some persons are free and\r\nsome are not--do you know that, Mary?' 'Yes, missis, _here_,' was the\r\nreply; 'I know it is so here, in this world.' Here my child's white nurse,\r\nmy dear Margery, who had hitherto been silent, interfered, saying, 'Oh,\r\nthen you think it will not always be so?' 'Me hope not, missis.' I am\r\nafraid, E----, this woman actually imagines that there will be no slaves\r\nin Heaven; isn't that preposterous now? when by the account of most of the\r\nSoutherners slavery itself must be Heaven, or something uncommonly like\r\nit. Oh, if you could imagine how this title 'Missis,' addressed to me and\r\nto my children, shocks all my feelings! Several times I have exclaimed,\r\n'For God's sake do not call me that!' and only been awakened, by the\r\nstupid amazement of the poor creatures I was addressing, to the perfect\r\nuselessness of my thus expostulating with them; once or twice indeed I\r\nhave done more--I have explained to them, and they appeared to comprehend\r\nme well, that I had no ownership over them, for that I held such ownership\r\nsinful, and that, though I was the wife of the man who pretends to own\r\nthem, I was in truth no more their mistress than they were mine. Some of\r\nthem I know understood me, more of them did not.\r\n\r\nOur servants--those who have been selected to wait upon us in the\r\nhouse--consist of a man, who is quite a tolerable cook (I believe this is\r\na natural gift with them, as with Frenchmen); a dairywoman, who churns for\r\nus; a laundrywoman; her daughter, our housemaid, the aforesaid Mary; and\r\ntwo young lads of from fifteen to twenty, who wait upon us in the capacity\r\nof footmen. As, however, the latter are perfectly filthy in their persons\r\nand clothes--their faces, hands, and naked feet being literally encrusted\r\nwith dirt--their attendance at our meals is not, as you may suppose,\r\nparticularly agreeable to me, and I dispense with it as often as possible.\r\nMary, too, is so intolerably offensive in her person that it is impossible\r\nto endure her proximity, and the consequence is that, amongst Mr. ----'s\r\nslaves, I wait upon myself more than I have ever done in my life before.\r\nAbout this same personal offensiveness, the Southerners you know insist\r\nthat it is inherent with the race, and it is one of their most cogent\r\nreasons for keeping them as slaves. But as this very disagreeable\r\npeculiarity does not prevent Southern women from hanging their infants at\r\nthe breasts of negresses, nor almost every planter's wife and daughter\r\nfrom having one or more little pet blacks sleeping like puppy dogs in\r\ntheir very bedchamber, nor almost every planter from admitting one or\r\nseveral of his female slaves to the still closer intimacy of his bed--it\r\nseems to me that this objection to doing them right is not very valid. I\r\ncannot imagine that they would smell much worse if they were free, or come\r\nin much closer contact with the delicate organs of their white, fellow\r\ncountrymen; indeed, inasmuch as good deeds are spoken of as having a sweet\r\nsavour before God, it might be supposed that the freeing of the blacks\r\nmight prove rather an odoriferous process than the contrary. However this\r\nmay be, I must tell you that this potent reason for enslaving a whole race\r\nof people is no more potent with me than most of the others adduced to\r\nsupport the system, inasmuch as, from observation and some experience, I\r\nam strongly inclined to believe that peculiar ignorance of the laws of\r\nhealth and the habits of decent cleanliness are the real and only causes\r\nof this disagreeable characteristic of the race--thorough ablutions and\r\nchange of linen, when tried, having been perfectly successful in removing\r\nall such objections; and if ever you have come into anything like\r\nneighbourly proximity with a low Irishman or woman, I think you will allow\r\nthat the same causes produce very nearly the same effects. The stench in\r\nan Irish, Scotch, Italian, or French hovel are quite as intolerable as any\r\nI ever found in our negro houses, and the filth and vermin which abound\r\nabout the clothes and persons of the lower peasantry of any of those\r\ncountries as abominable as the same conditions in the black population of\r\nthe United States. A total absence of self-respect begets these hateful\r\nphysical results, and in proportion as moral influences are remote,\r\nphysical evils will abound. Well-being, freedom, and industry induce\r\nself-respect, self-respect induces cleanliness and personal attention, so\r\nthat slavery is answerable for all the evils that exhibit themselves where\r\nit exists--from lying, thieving, and adultery, to dirty houses, ragged\r\nclothes, and foul smells.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Ganymedes. One of them--the eldest son of our\r\nlaundrywoman, and Mary's brother, a boy of the name of Aleck\r\n(Alexander)--is uncommonly bright and intelligent; he performs all the\r\noffices of a well-instructed waiter with great efficiency, and anywhere\r\nout of slave land would be able to earn fourteen or fifteen dollars a\r\nmonth for himself; he is remarkably good tempered and well disposed. The\r\nother poor boy is so stupid that he appears sullen from absolute darkness\r\nof intellect; instead of being a little lower than the angels, he is\r\nscarcely a little higher than the brutes, and to this condition are\r\nreduced the majority of his kind by the institutions under which they\r\nlive. I should tell you that Aleck's parents and kindred have always been\r\nabout the house of the overseer, and in daily habits of intercourse with\r\nhim and his wife; and wherever this is the case the effect of involuntary\r\neducation is evident in the improved intelligence of the degraded race.\r\nIn a conversation which Mr. ---- had this evening with Mr. O----, the\r\noverseer, the latter mentioned that two of our carpenters had in their\r\nleisure time made a boat, which they had disposed of to some neighbouring\r\nplanter for sixty dollars.\r\n\r\nNow, E----, I have no intention of telling you a one-sided story, or\r\nconcealing from you what are cited as the advantages which these poor\r\npeople possess; you, who know that no indulgence is worth simple justice,\r\neither to him who gives or him who receives, will not thence conclude that\r\ntheir situation thus mitigated is, therefore, what it should be. On this\r\nmatter of the sixty dollars earned by Mr. ----'s two men much stress was\r\nlaid by him and his overseer. I look at it thus: if these men were\r\nindustrious enough out of their scanty leisure to earn sixty dollars, how\r\nmuch more of remuneration, of comfort, of improvement might they not have\r\nachieved were the price of their daily labour duly paid them, instead of\r\nbeing unjustly withheld to support an idle young man and his idle\r\nfamily--i.e. myself and my children.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be well to inform you that the slaves on this plantation\r\nare divided into field hands and mechanics or artisans. The former, the\r\ngreat majority, are the more stupid and brutish of the tribe; the others,\r\nwho are regularly taught their trades, are not only exceedingly expert at\r\nthem, but exhibit a greater general activity of intellect, which must\r\nnecessarily result from even a partial degree of cultivation. There are\r\nhere a gang (for that is the honourable term) of coopers, of blacksmiths,\r\nof bricklayers, of carpenters--all well acquainted with their peculiar\r\ntrades. The latter constructed the wash-hand stands, clothes presses,\r\nsofas, tables, &c, with which our house is furnished, and they are very\r\nneat pieces of workmanship--neither veneered or polished indeed, nor of\r\nvery costly materials, but of the white pine wood planed as smooth as\r\nmarble--a species of furniture not very luxurious perhaps, but all the\r\nbetter adapted therefore to the house itself, which is certainly rather\r\nmore devoid of the conveniences and adornments of modern existence than\r\nanything I ever took up my abode in before. It consists of three small\r\nrooms, and three still smaller, which would be more appropriately\r\ndesignated as closets, a wooden recess by way of pantry, and a kitchen\r\ndetached from the dwelling--a mere wooden outhouse, with no floor but the\r\nbare earth, and for furniture a congregation of filthy negroes, who lounge\r\nin and out of it like hungry hounds at all hours of the day and night,\r\npicking up such scraps of food as they can find about, which they discuss\r\nsquatting down upon their hams, in which interesting position and\r\noccupation I generally find a number of them whenever I have sufficient\r\nhardihood to venture within those precincts, the sight of which and its\r\ntenants is enough to slacken the appetite of the hungriest hunter that\r\never lost all nice regards in the mere animal desire for food. Of our\r\nthree apartments, one is our sitting, eating, and _living_ room, and is\r\nsixteen feet by fifteen. The walls are plastered indeed, but neither\r\npainted nor papered; it is divided from our bed-room (a similarly elegant\r\nand comfortable chamber) by a dingy wooden partition covered all over with\r\nhooks, pegs, and nails, to which hats, caps, keys, &c. &c., are suspended\r\nin graceful irregularity. The doors open by wooden latches, raised by\r\nmeans of small bits of packthread--I imagine, the same primitive order of\r\nfastening celebrated in the touching chronicle of Red Riding Hood; how\r\nthey shut I will not pretend to describe, as the shutting of a door is a\r\nprocess of extremely rare occurrence throughout the whole Southern\r\ncountry. The third room, a chamber with sloping ceiling, immediately over\r\nour sitting-room and under the roof, is appropriated to the nurse and my\r\ntwo babies. Of the closets, one is Mr. ---- the overseer's bed-room, the\r\nother his office or place of business; and the third, adjoining our\r\nbed-room, and opening immediately out of doors, is Mr. ----'s dressing\r\nroom and cabinet d'affaires, where he gives audiences to the negroes,\r\nredresses grievances, distributes red woollen caps (a singular\r\ngratification to a slave), shaves himself, and performs the other offices\r\nof his toilet. Such being our abode, I think you will allow there is\r\nlittle danger of my being dazzled by the luxurious splendours of a\r\nSouthern slave residence. Our sole mode of summoning our attendants is by\r\na packthread bell-rope suspended in the sitting-room. From the bed-rooms\r\nwe have to raise the windows and our voices, and bring them by power of\r\nlungs, or help ourselves--which, I thank God, was never yet a hardship to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you just now that two of the carpenters had made a boat in\r\ntheir leisure time. I must explain this to you, and this will involve the\r\nmention of another of Miss Martineau's mistakes with regard to slave\r\nlabour, at least in many parts of the Southern States. She mentions that\r\non one estate of which she knew, the proprietor had made the experiment,\r\nand very successfully, of appointing to each of his slaves a certain task\r\nto be performed in the day, which once accomplished, no matter how early,\r\nthe rest of the four and twenty hours were allowed to the labourer to\r\nemploy as he pleased. She mentions this as a single experiment, and\r\nrejoices over it as a decided amelioration in the condition of the slave,\r\nand one deserving of general adoption. But in the part of Georgia where\r\nthis estate is situated, the custom of task labour is universal, and it\r\nprevails, I believe, throughout Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of\r\nNorth Carolina; in other parts of the latter State, however--as I was\r\ninformed by our overseer, who is a native of that State--the estates are\r\nsmall, rather deserving the name of farms, and the labourers are much\r\nupon the same footing as the labouring men at the North, working from\r\nsunrise to sunset in the fields with the farmer and his sons, and coming\r\nin with them to their meals, which they take immediately after the rest of\r\nthe family. In Louisiana and the new South-western Slave States, I\r\nbelieve, task labour does not prevail; but it is in those that the\r\ncondition of the poor human cattle is most deplorable, as you know it was\r\nthere that the humane calculation was not only made, but openly and\r\nunhesitatingly avowed, that the planters found it upon the whole their\r\nmost profitable plan to work off (kill with labour) their whole number of\r\nslaves about once in seven years, and renew the whole stock. By the bye,\r\nthe Jewish institution of slavery is much insisted upon by the Southern\r\nupholders of the system; perhaps this is their notion of the Jewish\r\njubilee, when the slaves were by Moses' strict enactment to be all set\r\nfree. Well, this task system is pursued on this estate; and thus it is\r\nthat the two carpenters were enabled to make the boat they sold for sixty\r\ndollars. These tasks, of course, profess to be graduated according to the\r\nsex, age, and strength of the labourer; but in many instances this is not\r\nthe case, as I think you will agree when I tell you that on Mr. ----'s\r\nfirst visit to his estates he found that the men and the women who\r\nlaboured in the fields had the same task to perform. This was a noble\r\nadmission of female equality, was it not?--and thus it had been on the\r\nestate for many years past. Mr. ----, of course, altered the distribution\r\nof the work, diminishing the quantity done by the women.\r\n\r\nI had a most ludicrous visit this morning from the midwife of the\r\nestate--rather an important personage both to master and slave, as to her\r\nunassisted skill and science the ushering of all the young negroes into\r\ntheir existence of bondage is entrusted. I heard a great deal of\r\nconversation in the dressing-room adjoining mine, while performing my own\r\ntoilet, and presently Mr. ---- opened my room-door, ushering in a dirty\r\nfat good-humoured looking old negress, saying, 'The midwife, Rose, wants\r\nto make your acquaintance.' 'Oh massa!' shrieked out the old creature in a\r\nparoxysm of admiration, 'where you get this lilly alablaster baby!' For a\r\nmoment I looked round to see if she was speaking of my baby; but no, my\r\ndear, this superlative apostrophe was elicited by the fairness of _my\r\nskin_--so much for degrees of comparison. Now, I suppose that if I chose\r\nto walk arm in arm with the dingiest mulatto through the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia, nobody could possibly tell by my complexion that I was not\r\nhis sister, so that the mere quality of mistress must have had a most\r\nmiraculous effect upon my skin in the eyes of poor Rose. But this species\r\nof outrageous flattery is as usual with these people as with the low\r\nIrish, and arises from the ignorant desire, common to both the races, of\r\npropitiating at all costs the fellow-creature who is to them as a\r\nProvidence--or rather, I should say, a fate--for 't is a heathen and no\r\nChristian relationship. Soon after this visit, I was summoned into the\r\nwooden porch or piazza of the house, to see a poor woman who desired to\r\nspeak to me. This was none other than the tall emaciated-looking negress\r\nwho, on the day of our arrival, had embraced me and my nurse with such\r\nirresistible zeal. She appeared very ill to-day, and presently unfolded to\r\nme a most distressing history of bodily afflictions. She was the mother of\r\na very large family, and complained to me that, what with child-bearing\r\nand hard field labour, her back was almost broken in two. With an almost\r\nsavage vehemence of gesticulation she suddenly tore up her scanty\r\nclothing, and exhibited a spectacle with which I was inconceivably shocked\r\nand sickened. The facts, without any of her corroborating statements, bore\r\ntolerable witness to the hardships of her existence. I promised to attend\r\nto her ailments and give her proper remedies; but these are natural\r\nresults, inevitable and irremediable ones, of improper treatment of the\r\nfemale frame--and though there may be alleviation, there cannot be any\r\ncure when once the beautiful and wonderful structure has been thus made\r\nthe victim of ignorance, folly, and wickedness.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of this poor woman, I walked down the settlement\r\ntowards the infirmary or hospital, calling in at one or two of the houses\r\nalong the row. These cabins consist of one room about twelve feet by\r\nfifteen, with a couple of closets smaller and closer than the state-rooms\r\nof a ship, divided off from the main room and each other by rough wooden\r\npartitions in which the inhabitants sleep. They have almost all of them a\r\nrude bedstead, with the grey moss of the forests for mattress, and filthy,\r\npestilential-looking blankets, for covering. Two families (sometimes eight\r\nand ten in number) reside in one of these huts, which are mere wooden\r\nframes pinned, as it were, to the earth by a brick chimney outside, whose\r\nenormous aperture within pours down a flood of air, but little\r\ncounteracted by the miserable spark of fire, which hardly sends an\r\nattenuated thread of lingering smoke up its huge throat. A wide ditch runs\r\nimmediately at the back of these dwellings, which is filled and emptied\r\ndaily by the tide. Attached to each hovel is a small scrap of ground for a\r\ngarden, which, however, is for the most part untended and uncultivated.\r\nSuch of these dwellings as I visited to-day were filthy and wretched in\r\nthe extreme, and exhibited that most deplorable consequence of ignorance\r\nand an abject condition, the inability of the inhabitants to secure and\r\nimprove even such pitiful comfort as might yet be achieved by them.\r\nInstead of the order, neatness, and ingenuity which might convert even\r\nthese miserable hovels into tolerable residences, there was the careless,\r\nreckless, filthy indolence which even the brutes do not exhibit in their\r\nlairs and nests, and which seemed incapable of applying to the uses of\r\nexistence the few miserable means of comfort yet within their reach.\r\nFirewood and shavings lay littered about the floors, while the half-naked\r\nchildren were cowering round two or three smouldering cinders. The moss\r\nwith which the chinks and crannies of their ill-protecting dwellings might\r\nhave been stuffed, was trailing in dirt and dust about the ground, while\r\nthe back-door of the huts, opening upon a most unsightly ditch, was left\r\nwide open for the fowls and ducks, which they are allowed to raise, to\r\ntravel in and out, increasing the filth of the cabin, by what they brought\r\nand left in every direction. In the midst of the floor, or squatting round\r\nthe cold hearth, would be four or five little children from four to ten\r\nyears old, the latter all with babies in their arms, the care of the\r\ninfants being taken from the mothers (who are driven a-field as soon as\r\nthey recover from child labour), and devolved upon these poor little\r\nnurses, as they are called, whose business it is to watch the infant, and\r\ncarry it to its mother whenever it may require nourishment. To these\r\nhardly human little beings, I addressed my remonstrances about the filth,\r\ncold, and unnecessary wretchedness of their room, bidding the elder boys\r\nand girls kindle up the fire, sweep the floor, and expel the poultry. For\r\na long time my very words seemed unintelligible to them, till when I began\r\nto sweep and make up the fire, &c., they first fell to laughing, and then\r\nimitating me. The encrustations of dirt on their hands, feet, and faces,\r\nwere my next object of attack, and the stupid negro practice (by the bye,\r\nbut a short time since nearly universal in enlightened Europe), of keeping\r\nthe babies with their feet bare, and their heads, already well capped by\r\nnature with their woolly hair, wrapped in half-a-dozen hot filthy\r\ncoverings. Thus I travelled down the 'street,' in every dwelling\r\nendeavouring to awaken a new perception, that of cleanliness, sighing, as\r\nI went, over the futility of my own exertions, for how can slaves be\r\nimproved? Nathless, thought I, let what can be done; for it may be, that,\r\nthe two being incompatible, improvement may yet expel slavery--and so it\r\nmight, and surely would, if, instead of beginning at the end, I could but\r\nbegin at the beginning of my task. If the mind and soul were awakened,\r\ninstead of mere physical good attempted, the physical good would result,\r\nand the great curse vanish away; but my hands are tied fast, and this\r\ncorner of the work is all that I may do. Yet it cannot be but, from my\r\nwords and actions, some revelations should reach these poor people; and\r\ngoing in and out amongst them perpetually, I shall teach, and they learn\r\ninvoluntarily a thousand things of deepest import. They must learn, and\r\nwho can tell the fruit of that knowledge alone, that there are beings in\r\nthe world, even with skins of a different colour from their own, who have\r\nsympathy for their misfortunes, love for their virtues, and respect for\r\ntheir common nature--but oh! my heart is full almost to bursting, as I\r\nwalk among these most poor creatures.\r\n\r\nThe infirmary is a large two-story building, terminating the broad\r\norange-planted space between the two rows of houses which form the first\r\nsettlement; it is built of white washed wood, and contains four\r\nlarge-sized rooms. But how shall I describe to you the spectacle which was\r\npresented to me, on my entering the first of these? But half the\r\ncasements, of which there were six, were glazed, and these were obscured\r\nwith dirt, almost as much as the other windowless ones were darkened by\r\nthe dingy shutters, which the shivering inmates had fastened to, in order\r\nto protect themselves from the cold. In the enormous chimney glimmered the\r\npowerless embers of a few sticks of wood, round which, however, as many of\r\nthe sick women as could approach, were cowering; some on wooden settles,\r\nmost of them on the ground, excluding those who were too ill to rise; and\r\nthese last poor wretches lay prostrate on the floor, without bed,\r\nmattress, or pillow, buried in tattered and filthy blankets, which,\r\nhuddled round them as they lay strewed about, left hardly space to move\r\nupon the floor. And here, in their hour of sickness and suffering, lay\r\nthose whose health and strength are spent in unrequited labour for\r\nus--those who, perhaps even yesterday, were being urged onto their unpaid\r\ntask--those whose husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, were even at that\r\nhour sweating over the earth, whose produce was to buy for us all the\r\nluxuries which health can revel in, all the comforts which can alleviate\r\nsickness. I stood in the midst of them, perfectly unable to speak, the\r\ntears pouring from my eyes at this sad spectacle of their misery, myself\r\nand my emotion alike strange and incomprehensible to them. Here lay women\r\nexpecting every hour the terrors and agonies of child-birth, others who\r\nhad just brought their doomed offspring into the world, others who were\r\ngroaning over the anguish and bitter disappointment of miscarriages--here\r\nlay some burning with fever, others chilled with cold and aching with\r\nrheumatism, upon the hard cold ground, the draughts and dampness of the\r\natmosphere increasing their sufferings, and dirt, noise, and stench, and\r\nevery aggravation of which sickness is capable, combined in their\r\ncondition--here they lay like brute beasts, absorbed in physical\r\nsuffering; unvisited by any of those Divine influences which may ennoble\r\nthe dispensations of pain and illness, forsaken, as it seemed to me, of\r\nall good; and yet, O God, Thou surely hadst not forsaken them! Now, pray\r\ntake notice, that this is the hospital of an estate, where the owners are\r\nsupposed to be humane, the overseer efficient and kind, and the negroes,\r\nremarkably well cared for and comfortable. As soon as I recovered from my\r\ndismay, I addressed old Rose, the midwife, who had charge of this room,\r\nbidding her open the shutters of such windows as were glazed, and let in\r\nthe light. I next proceeded to make up the fire, but upon my lifting a log\r\nfor that purpose, there was one universal outcry of horror, and old Rose,\r\nattempting to snatch it from me, exclaimed, 'Let alone, missis--let\r\nbe--what for you lift wood--you have nigger enough, missis, to do it!' I\r\nhereupon had to explain to them my view of the purposes for which hands\r\nand arms were appended to our bodies, and forthwith began making Rose tidy\r\nup the miserable apartment, removing all the filth and rubbish from the\r\nfloor that could be removed, folding up in piles the blankets of the\r\npatients who were not using them, and placing, in rather more sheltered\r\nand comfortable positions, those who were unable to rise. It was all that\r\nI could do, and having enforced upon them all my earnest desire that they\r\nshould keep their room swept, and as tidy as possible, I passed on to the\r\nother room on the ground floor, and to the two above, one of which is\r\nappropriated to the use of the men who are ill. They were all in the same\r\ndeplorable condition, the upper rooms being rather the more miserable,\r\ninasmuch as none of the windows were glazed at all, and they had,\r\ntherefore, only the alternative of utter darkness, or killing draughts of\r\nair, from the unsheltered casements. In all, filth, disorder and misery\r\nabounded; the floor was the only bed, and scanty begrimed rags of blankets\r\nthe only covering. I left this refuge for Mr. ----'s sick dependants, with\r\nmy clothes covered with dust, and full of vermin, and with a heart heavy\r\nenough, as you will well believe. My morning's work had fatigued me not a\r\nlittle, and I was glad to return to the house, where I gave vent to my\r\nindignation and regret at the scene I had just witnessed, to Mr. ---- and\r\nhis overseer, who, here, is a member of our family. The latter told me\r\nthat the condition of the hospital had appeared to him, from his first\r\nentering upon his situation (only within the last year), to require a\r\nreform, and that he had proposed it to the former manager, Mr. K----, and\r\nMr. ----'s brother, who is part proprietor of the estate, but receiving no\r\nencouragement from them, had supposed that it was a matter of indifference\r\nto the owners, and had left it in the condition in which he had found it,\r\nin which condition it has been for the last nineteen years and upwards.\r\n\r\nThis new overseer of ours has lived fourteen years with an old Scotch\r\ngentleman, who owns an estate adjoining Mr. ----'s, on the island of St.\r\nSimons, upon which estate, from everything I can gather, and from what I\r\nknow of the proprietor's character, the slaves are probably treated with\r\nas much humanity as is consistent with slavery at all, and where the\r\nmanagement and comfort of the hospital, in particular, had been most\r\ncarefully and judiciously attended to. With regard to the indifference of\r\nour former manager upon the subject of the accommodation for the sick, he\r\nwas an excellent overseer, _videlicet_, the estate returned a full income\r\nunder his management, and such men have nothing to do with sick\r\nslaves--they are tools, to be mended only if they can be made available\r\nagain,--if not, to be flung by as useless, without further expense of\r\nmoney, time, or trouble.\r\n\r\nI am learning to row here, for, circumscribed as my walks necessarily are,\r\nimpossible as it is to resort to my favourite exercise on horseback upon\r\nthese narrow dykes, I must do something to prevent my blood from\r\nstagnating; and this broad brimming river, and the beautiful light canoes\r\nwhich lie moored, at the steps, are very inviting persuaders to this\r\nspecies of exercise. My first attempt was confined to pulling an oar\r\nacross the stream, for which I rejoiced in sundry aches and pains\r\naltogether novel, letting alone a delightful row of blisters on each of my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you that in the hospital were several sick babies, whose\r\nmothers were permitted to suspend their field labour, in order to nurse\r\nthem. Upon addressing some remonstrances to one of these, who, besides\r\nhaving a sick child, was ill herself, about the horribly dirty condition\r\nof her baby, she assured me that it was impossible for them to keep their\r\nchildren clean, that they went out to work at daybreak, and did not get\r\ntheir tasks done till evening, and that then they were too tired and worn\r\nout to do anything but throw themselves down and sleep. This statement of\r\nhers I mentioned on my return from the hospital, and the overseer\r\nappeared extremely annoyed by it, and assured me repeatedly that it was\r\nnot true.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. ----, who had been over to Darien, mentioned that one\r\nof the storekeepers there had told him that, in the course of a few years,\r\nhe had paid the negroes of this estate several thousand dollars for moss,\r\nwhich is a very profitable article of traffic with them--they collect it\r\nfrom the trees, dry and pick it, and then sell it to the people in Darien\r\nfor mattresses, sofas, and all sorts of stuffing purposes,--which, in my\r\nopinion, it answers better than any other material whatever that I am\r\nacquainted with, being as light as horse hair, as springy and elastic, and\r\na great deal less harsh and rigid. It is now bed-time, dear E----, and I\r\ndoubt not it has been sleepy time with you over this letter, long ere you\r\ncame thus far. There is a preliminary to my repose, however, in this\r\nagreeable residence, which I rather dread, namely, the hunting for, or\r\ndiscovering without hunting, in fine relief upon the white-washed walls of\r\nmy bed-room, a most hideous and detestable species of _reptile_, called\r\ncentipedes, which come out of the cracks and crevices of the walls, and\r\nfill my very heart with dismay. They are from an inch to two inches long,\r\nand appear to have not a hundred, but a thousand legs. I cannot ascertain\r\nvery certainly from the negroes whether they sting or not, but they look\r\nexceedingly as if they might, and I visit my babies every night, in fear\r\nand tremblings lest I should find one or more of these hateful creatures\r\nmounting guard over them. Good night; you are well to be free from\r\ncentipedes--better to be free from slaves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. This morning I paid my second visit to the infirmary, and\r\nfound there had been some faint attempt at sweeping and cleaning, in\r\ncompliance with my entreaties. The poor woman Harriet, however, whose\r\nstatement, with regard to the impossibility of their attending properly to\r\ntheir children, had been so vehemently denied by the overseer, was crying\r\nbitterly. I asked her what ailed her, when, more by signs and dumb show\r\nthan words, she and old Rose informed me that Mr. O---- had flogged her\r\nthat morning, for having told me that the women had not time to keep their\r\nchildren clean. It is part of the regular duty of every overseer to visit\r\nthe infirmary at least once a day, which he generally does in the morning,\r\nand Mr. O----'s visit had preceded mine but a short time only, or I might\r\nhave been edified by seeing a man horsewhip a woman. I again and again\r\nmade her repeat her story, and she again and again affirmed that she had\r\nbeen flogged for what she told me, none of the whole company in the room\r\ndenying it, or contradicting her. I left the room, because I was so\r\ndisgusted and indignant, that I could hardly restrain my feelings, and to\r\nexpress them could have produced no single good result. In the next ward,\r\nstretched upon the ground, apparently either asleep or so overcome with\r\nsickness as to be incapable of moving, lay an immense woman,--her stature,\r\nas she cumbered the earth, must have been, I should think, five feet seven\r\nor eight, and her bulk enormous. She was wrapped in filthy rags, and lay\r\nwith her face on the floor. As I approached, and stooped to see what ailed\r\nher, she suddenly threw out her arms, and, seized with violent\r\nconvulsions, rolled over and over upon the floor, beating her head\r\nviolently upon the ground, and throwing her enormous limbs about in a\r\nhorrible manner. Immediately upon the occurrence of this fit, four or five\r\nwomen threw themselves literally upon her, and held her down by main\r\nforce; they even proceeded to bind her legs and arms together, to prevent\r\nher dashing herself about; but this violent coercion and tight bandaging\r\nseemed to me, in my profound ignorance, more likely to increase her\r\nillness, by impeding her breathing, and the circulation of her blood, and\r\nI bade them desist, and unfasten all the strings and ligatures, not only\r\nthat they had put round her limbs, but which, by tightening her clothes\r\nround her body, caused any obstruction. How much I wished that, instead of\r\nmusic and dancing and such stuff, I had learned something of sickness and\r\nhealth, of the conditions and liabilities of the human body, that I might\r\nhave known how to assist this poor creature, and to direct her ignorant\r\nand helpless nurses! The fit presently subsided, and was succeeded by the\r\nmost deplorable prostration and weakness of nerves, the tears streaming\r\ndown the poor woman's cheeks in showers, without, however, her uttering a\r\nsingle word, though she moaned incessantly. After bathing her forehead,\r\nhands, and chest with vinegar, we raised her up, and I sent to the house\r\nfor a chair with a back (there was no such thing in the hospital,) and we\r\ncontrived to place her in it. I have seldom seen finer women than this\r\npoor creature and her younger sister, an immense strapping lass, called\r\nChloe--tall, straight, and extremely well made--who was assisting her\r\nsister, and whom I had remarked, for the extreme delight and merriment\r\nwhich my cleansing propensities seemed to give her, on my last visit to\r\nthe hospital. She was here taking care of a sick baby, and helping to\r\nnurse her sister Molly, who, it seems, is subject to those fits, about\r\nwhich I spoke to our physician here--an intelligent man, residing in\r\nDarien, who visits the estate whenever medical assistance is required. He\r\nseemed to attribute them to nervous disorder, brought on by frequent child\r\nbearing. This woman is young, I suppose at the outside not thirty, and her\r\nsister informed me that she had had ten children--ten children, E----!\r\nFits and hard labour in the fields, unpaid labour, labour exacted with\r\nstripes--how do you fancy that? I wonder if my mere narration can make\r\nyour blood boil, as the facts did mine? Among the patients in this room\r\nwas a young girl, apparently from fourteen to fifteen, whose hands and\r\nfeet were literally rotting away piecemeal, from the effect of a horrible\r\ndisease, to which the negroes are subject here, and I believe in the West\r\nIndies, and when it attacks the joints of the toes and fingers, the pieces\r\nabsolutely decay and come off, leaving the limb a maimed and horrible\r\nstump! I believe no cure is known for this disgusting malady, which seems\r\nconfined to these poor creatures. Another disease, of which they\r\ncomplained much, and which, of course, I was utterly incapable of\r\naccounting for, was a species of lock-jaw, to which their babies very\r\nfrequently fall victims, in the first or second week after their birth,\r\nrefusing the breast, and the mouth gradually losing the power of opening\r\nitself. The horrible diseased state of head, common among their babies, is\r\na mere result of filth and confinement, and therefore, though I never\r\nanywhere saw such distressing and disgusting objects as some of these poor\r\nlittle woolly skulls presented, the cause was sufficiently obvious.\r\nPleurisy, or a tendency to it, seems very common among them; also\r\nperi-pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs, which is terribly prevalent,\r\nand generally fatal. Rheumatism is almost universal; and as it proceeds\r\nfrom exposure, and want of knowledge and care, attacks indiscriminately\r\nthe young and old. A great number of the women are victims to falling of\r\nthe womb and weakness in the spine; but these are necessary results of\r\ntheir laborious existence, and do not belong either to climate or\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nI have ingeniously contrived to introduce bribery, corruption, and\r\npauperism, all in a breath, upon this island, which, until my advent, was\r\nas innocent of these pollutions, I suppose, as Prospero's isle of refuge.\r\nWishing, however, to appeal to some perception, perhaps a little less dim\r\nin their minds than the abstract loveliness of cleanliness, I have\r\nproclaimed to all the little baby nurses, that I will give a cent to every\r\nlittle boy or girl whose baby's face shall be clean, and one to every\r\nindividual with clean face and hands of their own. My appeal was fully\r\ncomprehended by the majority, it seems, for this morning I was surrounded,\r\nas soon as I came out, by a swarm of children carrying their little\r\ncharges on their backs and in their arms, the shining, and, in many\r\ninstances, wet faces and hands of the latter, bearing ample testimony to\r\nthe ablutions which had been inflicted upon them. How they will curse me\r\nand the copper cause of all their woes, in their baby bosoms! Do you know\r\nthat little as grown negroes are admirable for their personal beauty (in\r\nmy opinion, at least), the black babies of a year or two old are very\r\npretty; they have for the most part beautiful eyes and eyelashes, the\r\npearly perfect teeth, which they retain after their other juvenile graces\r\nhave left them; their skins are all (I mean of blacks generally)\r\ninfinitely finer and softer than the skins of white people. Perhaps you\r\nare not aware that among the white race the _finest grained_ skins\r\ngenerally belong to persons of dark complexion. This, as a characteristic\r\nof the black race, I think might be accepted as some compensation for the\r\ncoarse woolly hair. The nose and mouth, which are so peculiarly\r\ndispleasing in their conformation in the face of a negro man or woman,\r\nbeing the features least developed in a baby's countenance, do not at\r\nfirst present the ugliness which they assume as they become more marked;\r\nand when the very unusual operation of washing has been performed, the\r\nblood shines through the fine texture of the skin, giving life and\r\nrichness to the dingy colour, and displaying a species of beauty which I\r\nthink scarcely any body who observed it would fail to acknowledge. I have\r\nseen many babies on this plantation, who were quite as pretty as white\r\nchildren, and this very day stooped to kiss a little sleeping creature,\r\nthat lay on its mother's knees in the infirmary--as beautiful a specimen\r\nof a sleeping infant as I ever saw. The caress excited the irrepressible\r\ndelight of all the women present--poor creatures! who seemed to forget\r\nthat I was a woman, and had children myself, and bore a woman's and a\r\nmother's heart towards them and theirs; but, indeed, the Honourable Mr.\r\nSlumkey could not have achieved more popularity by his performances in\r\nthat line than I, by this exhibition of feeling; and had the question been\r\nmy election, I am very sure nobody else would have had a chance of a vote\r\nthrough the island. But wisely is it said, that use is second nature; and\r\nthe contempt and neglect to which these poor people are used, make the\r\ncommonest expression of human sympathy appear a boon and gracious\r\ncondescension. While I am speaking of the negro countenance, there is\r\nanother beauty which is not at all unfrequent among those I see here--a\r\nfinely shaped oval face--and those who know (as all painters and\r\nsculptors, all who understand beauty do) how much expression there is in\r\nthe outline of the head, and how very rare it is to see a well-formed\r\nface, will be apt to consider this a higher matter than any colouring of\r\nwhich, indeed, the red and white one so often admired is by no means the\r\nmost rich, picturesque, or expressive. At first the dark colour confounded\r\nall features to my eye, and I could hardly tell one face from another.\r\nBecoming, however, accustomed to the complexion, I now perceive all the\r\nvariety among these black countenances that there is among our own race,\r\nand as much difference in features and in expression as among the same\r\nnumber of whites. There is another peculiarity which I have remarked among\r\nthe women here--very considerable beauty in the make of the hands; their\r\nfeet are very generally ill made, which must be a natural, and not an\r\nacquired defect, as they seldom injure their feet by wearing shoes. The\r\nfigures of some of the women are handsome, and their carriage, from the\r\nabsence of any confining or tightening clothing, and the habit they have\r\nof balancing great weights on their heads, erect and good.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the row of houses, and nearest to our overseer's\r\nresidence, is the hut of the head driver. Let me explain, by the way, his\r\noffice. The negroes, as I before told you, are divided into troops or\r\ngangs, as they are called; at the head of each gang is a driver, who\r\nstands over them, whip in hand, while they perform their daily task, who\r\nrenders an account of each individual slave and his work every evening to\r\nthe overseer, and receives from him directions for their next day's tasks.\r\nEach driver is allowed to inflict a dozen lashes upon any refractory slave\r\nin the field, and at the time of the offence; they may not, however,\r\nextend the chastisement, and if it is found ineffectual, their remedy lies\r\nin reporting the unmanageable individual either to the head driver or the\r\noverseer; the former of whom has power to inflict three dozen lashes at\r\nhis own discretion, and the latter as many as he himself sees fit, within\r\nthe number of fifty; which limit, however, I must tell you, is an\r\narbitrary one on this plantation, appointed by the founder of the estate,\r\nMajor ----, Mr. ----'s grandfather, many of whose regulations, indeed I\r\nbelieve most of them, are still observed in the government of the\r\nplantation. Limits of this sort, however, to the power of either driver,\r\nhead driver, or overseer, may or may not exist elsewhere; they are, to a\r\ncertain degree, a check upon the power of these individuals; but in the\r\nabsence of the master, the overseer may confine himself within the limit\r\nor not, as he chooses--and as for the master himself, where is his limit?\r\nHe may, if he likes, flog a slave to death, for the laws which pretend\r\nthat he may not are a mere pretence--inasmuch as the testimony of a black\r\nis never taken against a white; and upon this plantation of ours, and a\r\nthousand more, the overseer is the _only_ white man, so whence should come\r\nthe testimony to any crime of his? With regard to the oft-repeated\r\nstatement, that it is not the owner's interest to destroy his human\r\nproperty, it answers nothing--the instances in which men, to gratify the\r\nimmediate impulse of passion, sacrifice not only their eternal, but their\r\nevident, palpable, positive worldly interest, are infinite. Nothing is\r\ncommoner than for a man under the transient influence of anger to\r\ndisregard his worldly advantage; and the black slave, whose preservation\r\nis indeed supposed to be his owner's interest, may be, will be, and is\r\noccasionally sacrificed to the blind impulse of passion.\r\n\r\nTo return to our head driver, or, as he is familiarly called, head man,\r\nFrank--he is second in authority only to the overseer, and exercises rule\r\nalike over the drivers and the gangs, in the absence of the sovereign\r\nwhite man from the estate, which happens whenever Mr. O---- visits the\r\nother two plantations at Woodville and St. Simons. He is sole master and\r\ngovernor of the island, appoints the work, pronounces punishments, gives\r\npermission to the men to leave the island (without it they never may do\r\nso), and exercises all functions of undisputed mastery over his fellow\r\nslaves, for you will observe that all this while he is just as much a\r\nslave as any of the rest. Trustworthy, upright, intelligent, he may be\r\nflogged to-morrow if Mr. O---- or Mr. ---- so please it, and sold the next\r\nday like a cart horse, at the will of the latter. Besides his various\r\nother responsibilities, he has the key of all the stores, and gives out\r\nthe people's rations weekly; nor is it only the people's provisions that\r\nare put under his charge--meat, which is only given out to them\r\noccasionally, and provisions for the use of the family are also entrusted\r\nto his care. Thus you see, among these _inferior_ creatures, their own\r\nmasters yet look to find, surviving all their best efforts to destroy\r\nthem--good sense, honesty, self-denial, and all the qualities, mental and\r\nmoral, that make one man worthy to be trusted by another. From the\r\nimperceptible, but inevitable effect of the sympathies and influences of\r\nhuman creatures towards and over each other, Frank's intelligence has\r\nbecome uncommonly developed by intimate communion in the discharge of his\r\nduty with the former overseer, a very intelligent man, who has only just\r\nleft the estate, after managing it for nineteen years; the effect of this\r\nintercourse, and of the trust and responsibility laid upon the man, are\r\nthat he is clear-headed, well judging, active, intelligent, extremely well\r\nmannered, and, being respected, he respects himself. He is as ignorant as\r\nthe rest of the slaves; but he is always clean and tidy in his person,\r\nwith a courteousness of demeanour far removed from servility, and exhibits\r\na strong instance of the intolerable and wicked injustice of the system\r\nunder which he lives, having advanced thus far towards improvement, in\r\nspite of all the bars it puts to progress; and here being arrested, not by\r\nwant of energy, want of sense, or any want of his own, but by being held\r\nas another man's property, who can only thus hold him by forbidding him\r\nfurther improvement. When I see that man, who keeps himself a good deal\r\naloof from the rest, in his leisure hours looking, with a countenance of\r\ndeep thought, as I did to-day, over the broad river, which is to him as a\r\nprison wall, to the fields and forest beyond, not one inch or branch of\r\nwhich his utmost industry can conquer as his own, or acquire and leave an\r\nindependent heritage to his children, I marvel what the thoughts of such a\r\nman may be. I was in his house to-day, and the same superiority in\r\ncleanliness, comfort, and propriety exhibited itself in his dwelling, as\r\nin his own personal appearance, and that of his wife--a most active,\r\ntrustworthy, excellent woman, daughter of the oldest, and probably most\r\nhighly respected of all Mr. ----'s slaves. To the excellent conduct of\r\nthis woman, and indeed every member of her family, both the present and\r\nthe last overseer bear unqualified testimony.\r\n\r\nAs I was returning towards the house, after my long morning's lounge, a\r\nman rushed out of the blacksmith's shop, and catching me by the skirt of\r\nmy gown, poured forth a torrent of self-gratulations on having at length\r\nfound the 'right missis.' They have no idea, of course, of a white person\r\nperforming any of the offices of a servant, and as throughout the whole\r\nSouthern country the owner's children are nursed and tended, and sometimes\r\n_suckled_ by their slaves (I wonder how this inferior milk agrees with the\r\nlordly _white_ babies?) the appearance of M---- with my two children had\r\nimmediately suggested the idea that she must be the missis. Many of the\r\npoor negroes flocked to her, paying their profound homage under this\r\nimpression; and when she explained to them that she was not their owner's\r\nwife, the confusion in their minds seemed very great--Heaven only knows\r\nwhether they did not conclude that they had two mistresses, and Mr. ----\r\ntwo wives; for the privileged race must seem, in their eyes, to have such\r\nabsolute masterdom on earth, that perhaps they thought polygamy might be\r\none of the sovereign white men's numerous indulgences. The ecstacy of the\r\nblacksmith on discovering the 'right missis' at last was very funny, and\r\nwas expressed with such extraordinary grimaces, contortions, and\r\ngesticulations, that I thought I should have died of laughing at this\r\nrapturous identification of my most melancholy relation to the poor\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nHaving at length extricated myself from the group which forms round me\r\nwhenever I stop but for a few minutes, I pursued my voyage of discovery by\r\npeeping into the kitchen garden. I dared do no more; the aspect of the\r\nplace would have rejoiced the very soul of Solomon's sluggard of old--a\r\nfew cabbages and weeds innumerable filled the neglected looking enclosure,\r\nand I ventured no further than the entrance into its most uninviting\r\nprecincts. You are to understand that upon this swamp island of ours we\r\nhave quite a large stock of cattle, cows, sheep, pigs, and poultry in the\r\nmost enormous and inconvenient abundance. The cows are pretty miserably\r\noff for pasture, the banks and pathways of the dykes being their only\r\ngrazing ground, which the sheep perambulate also, in earnest search of a\r\nnibble of fresh herbage; both the cows and sheep are fed with rice flour\r\nin great abundance, and are pretty often carried down for change of air\r\nand more sufficient grazing to Hampton, Mr. ----'s estate, on the island\r\nof St. Simons, fifteen miles from this place, further down the river--or\r\nrather, indeed, I should say in the sea, for 'tis salt water all round,\r\nand one end of the island has a noble beach open to the vast Atlantic. The\r\npigs thrive admirably here, and attain very great perfection of size and\r\nflavour; the rice flour, upon which they are chiefly fed, tending to make\r\nthem very delicate. As for the poultry, it being one of the few privileges\r\nof the poor blacks to raise as many as they can, their abundance is\r\nliterally a nuisance--ducks, fowls, pigeons, turkeys (the two latter\r\nspecies, by the bye, are exclusively the master's property), cluck,\r\nscream, gabble, gobble, crow, cackle, fight, fly, and flutter in all\r\ndirections, and to their immense concourse, and the perfect freedom with\r\nwhich they intrude themselves even into the piazza of the house, the\r\npantry, and kitchen, I partly attribute the swarms of fleas, and other\r\nstill less agreeable vermin, with which we are most horribly pestered.\r\n\r\nMy walk lay to-day along the bank of a canal, which has been dug through\r\nnearly the whole length of the island, to render more direct and easy the\r\ntransportation of the rice from one end of the estate to another, or from\r\nthe various distant fields to the principal mill at Settlement No. 1. It\r\nis of considerable width and depth, and opens by various locks into the\r\nriver. It has, unfortunately, no trees on its banks, but a good footpath\r\nrenders it, in spite of that deficiency, about the best walk on the\r\nisland. I passed again to-day one of those beautiful evergreen thickets,\r\nwhich I described to you in my last letter; it is called a reserve, and is\r\nkept uncleared and uncultivated in its natural swampy condition, to allow\r\nof the people's procuring their firewood from it. I cannot get accustomed,\r\nso as to be indifferent to this exquisite natural ornamental growth, and\r\nthink, as I contemplate the various and beautiful foliage of these watery\r\nwoods, how many of our finest English parks and gardens owe their chiefest\r\nadornments to plantations of these shrubs, procured at immense cost,\r\nreared with infinite pains and care, which are here basking in the\r\nwinter's sunshine, waiting to be cut down for firewood! These little\r\ngroves are peopled with wild pigeons and birds, which they designate here\r\nas blackbirds. These sometimes rise from the rice fields with a whirr of\r\nmultitudinous wings, that is almost startling, and positively overshadow\r\nthe ground beneath like a cloud.\r\n\r\nI had a conversation that interested me a good deal, during my walk\r\nto-day, with my peculiar slave Jack. This lad, whom Mr. ---- has appointed\r\nto attend me in my roamings about the island, and rowing expeditions on\r\nthe river, is the son of the last head driver, a man of very extraordinary\r\nintelligence and faithfulness--such, at least, is the account given of him\r\nby his employers (in the burial-ground of the negroes is a stone dedicated\r\nto his memory, a mark of distinction accorded by his masters, which his\r\nson never failed to point out to me, when we passed that way). Jack\r\nappears to inherit his quickness of apprehension; his questions, like\r\nthose of an intelligent child, are absolutely inexhaustible; his curiosity\r\nabout all things beyond this island, the prison-house of his existence,\r\nis perfectly intense; his countenance is very pleasing, mild, and not\r\notherwise than thoughtful; he is, in common with the rest of them, a\r\nstupendous flatterer, and, like the rest of them, also seems devoid of\r\nphysical and moral courage. To-day, in the midst of his torrent of\r\nenquiries about places and things, I suddenly asked him if he would like\r\nto be free. A gleam of light absolutely shot over his whole countenance,\r\nlike the vivid and instantaneous lightning--he stammered, hesitated,\r\nbecame excessively confused, and at length replied--'Free, missis? what\r\nfor me wish to be free? Oh! no, missis, me no wish to be free, if massa\r\nonly let we keep pig.' The fear of offending, by uttering that forbidden\r\nwish--the dread of admitting, by its expression, the slightest discontent\r\nwith his present situation--the desire to conciliate my favour, even at\r\nthe expense of strangling the intense natural longing that absolutely\r\nglowed in his every feature--it was a sad spectacle, and I repented my\r\nquestion. As for the pitiful request which he reiterated several times\r\nadding, 'No, missis, me no want to be free--me work till me die for missis\r\nand massa,' with increased emphasis; it amounted only to this, that the\r\nnegroes once were, but no longer are, permitted to keep pigs. The increase\r\nof filth and foul smells, consequent upon their being raised, is, of\r\ncourse, very great; and, moreover, Mr. ---- told me, when I preferred poor\r\nJack's request to him, that their allowance was no more than would suffice\r\ntheir own necessity, and that they had not the means of feeding the\r\nanimals. With a little good management they might very easily obtain them,\r\nhowever; their little 'kail-yard' alone would suffice to it, and the pork\r\nand bacon would prove a most welcome addition to their farinaceous diet.\r\nYou perceive at once (or if you could have seen the boy's face, you would\r\nhave perceived at once), that his situation was no mystery to him, that\r\nhis value to Mr. ----, and, as he supposed, to me, was perfectly well\r\nknown to him, and that he comprehended immediately that his expressing\r\neven the desire to be free, might be construed by me into an offence, and\r\nsought by eager protestations of his delighted acquiescence in slavery, to\r\nconceal his soul's natural yearning, lest I should resent it. 'T was a sad\r\npassage between us, and sent me home full of the most painful thoughts. I\r\ntold Mr. ----, with much indignation, of poor Harriet's flogging, and\r\nrepresented that if the people were to be chastised for anything they said\r\nto me, I must leave the place, as I could not but hear their complaints,\r\nand endeavour, by all my miserable limited means, to better their\r\ncondition while I was here. He said he would ask Mr. O---- about it,\r\nassuring me, at the same time, that it was impossible to believe a single\r\nword any of these people said. At dinner, accordingly, the enquiry was\r\nmade as to the cause of her punishment, and Mr. O---- then said it was not\r\nat all for what she had told me, that he had flogged her, but for having\r\nanswered him impertinently, that he had ordered her into the field,\r\nwhereupon she had said she was ill and could not work, that he retorted he\r\nknew better, and bade her get up and go to work; she replied, 'Very well,\r\nI'll go, but I shall just come back again!' meaning, that when in the\r\nfield, she would be unable to work, and obliged, to return to the\r\nhospital. 'For this reply,' Mr. O---- said, 'I gave her a good lashing; it\r\nwas her business to have gone into the field without answering me, and\r\nthen we should have soon seen whether she could work or not; I gave it to\r\nChloe too, for some such impudence.' I give you the words of the\r\nconversation, which was prolonged to a great length, the overseer\r\ncomplaining of sham sicknesses of the slaves, and detailing the most\r\ndisgusting struggle which is going on the whole time, on the one hand to\r\ninflict, and on the other, to evade oppression and injustice. With this\r\nsauce I ate my dinner, and truly it tasted bitter.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset I went on the river to take my rowing lesson. A darling\r\nlittle canoe which carries two oars and a steersman, and rejoices in the\r\nappropriate title of the 'Dolphin,' is my especial vessel; and with Jack's\r\nhelp and instructions, I contrived this evening to row upwards of half a\r\nmile, coasting the reed-crowned edge of the island to another very large\r\nrice mill, the enormous wheel of which is turned by the tide. A small bank\r\nof mud and sand covered with reedy coarse grass divides the river into two\r\narms on this side of the island; the deep channel is on the outside of\r\nthis bank, and as we rowed home this evening, the tide having fallen, we\r\nscraped sand almost the whole way. Mr. ----'s domain, it seems to me, will\r\npresently fill up this shallow stream, and join itself to the\r\nabove-mentioned mud-bank. The whole course of this most noble river is\r\nfull of shoals, banks, mud, and sand-bars, and the navigation, which is\r\ndifficult to those who know it well, is utterly baffling to the\r\ninexperienced. The fact is, that the two elements are so fused hereabouts,\r\nthat there are hardly such things as earth or water proper; that which\r\nstyles itself the former, is a fat, muddy, slimy sponge, that, floating\r\nhalf under the turbid river, looks yet saturated with the thick waves\r\nwhich every now and then reclaim their late dominion, and cover it almost\r\nentirely; the water, again, cloudy and yellow, like pea-soup, seems but a\r\nsolution of such islands, rolling turbid and thick with alluvium, which it\r\nboth gathers and deposits as it sweeps along with a swollen, smooth\r\nrapidity, that almost deceives the eye. Amphibious creatures, alligators,\r\nserpents, and wild fowl, haunt these yet but half-formed regions, where\r\nland and water are of the consistency of hasty-pudding--the one seeming\r\ntoo unstable to walk on, the other almost too thick to float in. But then,\r\nthe sky, if no human chisel ever yet cut breath, neither did any human pen\r\never write light; if it did, mine should spread out before you the\r\nunspeakable glories of these southern heavens, the saffron brightness of\r\nmorning, the blue intense brilliancy of noon, the golden splendour and the\r\nrosy softness of sunset. Italy and Claude Lorraine may go hang themselves\r\ntogether! Heaven itself does not seem brighter or more beautiful to the\r\nimagination, than these surpassing pageants of fiery rays, and piled-up\r\nbeds of orange, golden clouds, with edges too bright to look on, scattered\r\nwreaths of faintest rosy bloom, amber streaks and pale green lakes\r\nbetween, and amid sky all mingled blue and rose tints, a spectacle to make\r\none fall over the boat's side, with one's head broken off, with looking\r\nadoringly upwards, but which, on paper, means nothing.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock our little canoe grazed the steps at the landing. These\r\nwere covered with young women, and boys, and girls, drawing water for\r\ntheir various household purposes. A very small cedar pail--a piggin, as\r\nthey termed it--serves to scoop up the river water, and having, by this\r\nmeans, filled a large bucket, they transfer this to their heads, and thus\r\nladen, march home with the purifying element--what to do with it, I cannot\r\nimagine, for evidence of its ever having been introduced into their\r\ndwellings, I saw none. As I ascended the stairs, they surrounded me with\r\nshrieks and yells of joy, uttering exclamations of delight and amazement\r\nat my rowing. Considering that they dig, delve, carry burthens, and\r\nperform many more athletic exercises than pulling a light oar, I was\r\nrather amused at this; but it was the singular fact of seeing a white\r\nwoman stretch her sinews in any toilsome exercise which astounded them,\r\naccustomed as they are to see both men and women of the privileged skin\r\neschew the slightest shadow of labour, as a thing not only painful but\r\ndegrading. They will learn another lesson from me, however, whose idea of\r\nHeaven was pronounced by a friend of mine, to whom I once communicated it,\r\nto be 'devilish hard work'! It was only just six o'clock, and these women\r\nhad all done their tasks. I exhorted them to go home and wash their\r\nchildren, and clean their houses and themselves, which they professed\r\nthemselves ready to do, but said they had no soap. Then began a chorus of\r\nmingled requests for soap, for summer clothing, and a variety of things,\r\nwhich, if 'Missis only give we, we be so clean for ever!'\r\n\r\nThis request for summer clothing, by the by, I think a very reasonable\r\none. The allowance of clothes made yearly to each slave by the present\r\nregulations of the estate, is a certain number of yards of flannel, and as\r\nmuch more of what they call plains--an extremely stout, thick, heavy\r\nwoollen cloth, of a dark grey or blue colour, which resembles the species\r\nof carpet we call drugget. This, and two pair of shoes, is the regular\r\nration of clothing; but these plains would be intolerable to any but\r\nnegroes, even in winter, in this climate, and are intolerable to them in\r\nthe summer. A far better arrangement, in my opinion, would be to increase\r\ntheir allowance of flannel and under clothing, and give them dark chintzes\r\ninstead of these thick carpets, which are very often the only covering\r\nthey wear at all. I did not impart all this to my petitioners, but\r\ndisengaging myself from them, for they held my hands and clothes, I\r\nconjured them to offer us some encouragement to better their condition, by\r\nbettering it as much as they could themselves,--enforced the virtue of\r\nwashing themselves and all belonging to them, and at length made good my\r\nretreat. As there is no particular reason why such a letter as this should\r\never come to an end, I had better spare you for the present. You shall\r\nhave a faithful journal, I promise you, henceforward, as hitherto, from\r\nyour's ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. We had a species of fish this morning for our breakfast, which\r\ndeserves more glory than I can bestow upon it. Had I been the ingenious\r\nman who wrote a poem upon fish, the white mullet of the Altamaha should\r\nhave been at least my heroine's cousin. 'Tis the heavenliest creature that\r\ngoes upon fins. I took a long walk this morning to Settlement No. 3, the\r\nthird village on the island. My way lay along the side of the canal,\r\nbeyond which, and only divided from it by a raised narrow causeway, rolled\r\nthe brimming river with its girdle of glittering evergreens, while on my\r\nother hand a deep trench marked the line of the rice fields. It really\r\nseemed as if the increase of merely a shower of rain might join all these\r\nwaters together, and lay the island under its original covering again. I\r\nvisited the people and houses here. I found nothing in any respect\r\ndifferent from what I have described to you at Settlement No. 1. During\r\nthe course of my walk, I startled from its repose in one of the\r\nrice-fields, a huge blue heron. You must have seen, as I often have, these\r\ncreatures stuffed in museums; but 't is another matter, and far more\r\ncurious, to meet them stalking on their stilts of legs over a rice-field,\r\nand then on your near approach, see them spread their wide heavy wings,\r\nand throw themselves upon the air, with their long shanks flying after\r\nthem in a most grotesque and laughable manner. They fly as if they did not\r\nknow how to do it very well; but standing still, their height (between\r\nfour and five feet) and peculiar colour, a dusky, greyish blue, with black\r\nabout the head, render their appearance very beautiful and striking.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I and Jack rowed ourselves over to Darien. It is\r\nSaturday--the day of the week on which the slaves from the island are\r\npermitted to come over to the town, to purchase such things as they may\r\nrequire and can afford, and to dispose, to the best advantage, of their\r\npoultry, moss, and eggs. I met many of them paddling themselves singly\r\nin their slight canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, and parties\r\nof three and four rowing boats of their own building, laden with their\r\npurchases, singing, laughing, talking, and apparently enjoying their\r\nholiday to the utmost. They all hailed me with shouts of delight, as I\r\npulled past them, and many were the injunctions bawled after Jack, to\r\n'mind and take good care of Missis!' We returned home through the glory\r\nof a sunset all amber-coloured and rosy, and found that one of the\r\nslaves, a young lad for whom Mr. ---- has a particular regard, was\r\ndangerously ill. Dr. H---- was sent for; and there is every probability\r\nthat he, Mr. ----and Mr. O---- will be up all night with the poor\r\nfellow. I shall write more to-morrow. To-day being Sunday, dear E----, a\r\nlarge boat full of Mr. ----'s people from Hampton came up, to go to\r\nchurch at Darien, and to pay their respects to their master, and see\r\ntheir new 'Missis.' The same scene was acted over again that occurred on\r\nour first arrival. A crowd clustered round the house door, to whom I and\r\nmy babies were produced, and with every individual of whom we had to\r\nshake hands some half-a-dozen times. They brought us up presents of eggs\r\n(their only wealth), beseeching us to take them, and one young lad, the\r\nson of head-man Frank, had a beautiful pair of chickens, which he\r\noffered most earnestly to S----. We took one of them, not to mortify the\r\npoor fellow, and a green ribbon being tied round its leg, it became a\r\nsacred fowl, 'little missis's chicken.' By the by, this young man had so\r\nlight a complexion, and such regular straight features, that, had I seen\r\nhim anywhere else, I should have taken him for a southern European, or,\r\nperhaps, in favour of his tatters, a gipsy; but certainly it never would\r\nhave occurred to me that he was the son of negro parents. I observed\r\nthis to Mr. ----, who merely replied, 'He is the son of head-man Frank\r\nand his wife Betty, and they are both black enough, as you see.' The\r\nexpressions of devotion and delight of these poor people are the most\r\nfervent you can imagine. One of them, speaking to me of Mr. ----, and\r\nsaying that they had heard that he had not been well, added, 'Oh! we\r\nhear so, missis, and we not know what to do. Oh! missis, massa sick, all\r\nhim people _broken_!'\r\n\r\nDr. H---- came again to-day to see the poor sick boy, who is doing much\r\nbetter, and bidding fair to recover. He entertained me with an account of\r\nthe Darien society, its aristocracies and democracies, its little\r\ngrandeurs and smaller pettinesses, its circles higher and lower, its\r\nsocial jealousies, fine invisible lines of demarcation, imperceptible\r\nshades of different respectability, and delicate divisions of genteel,\r\ngenteeler, genteelest. 'For me,' added the worthy doctor, 'I cannot well\r\nenter into the spirit of these nice distinctions; it suits neither my\r\ntaste nor my interest, and my house is, perhaps, the only one in Darien,\r\nwhere you would find all these opposite and contending elements\r\ncombined.' The doctor is connected with the aristocracy of the place, and,\r\nlike a wise man, remembers, notwithstanding, that those who are not, are\r\nquite as liable to be ill, and call in medical assistance, as those who\r\nare. He is a shrewd, intelligent man, with an excellent knowledge of his\r\nprofession, much kindness of heart, and apparent cheerful good temper. I\r\nhave already severely tried the latter, by the unequivocal expression of\r\nmy opinions on the subject of slavery, and, though I perceived that it\r\nrequired all his self-command to listen with anything like patience to my\r\nhighly incendiary and inflammatory doctrines, he yet did so, and though he\r\nwas, I have no doubt, perfectly horror-stricken at the discovery, lost\r\nnothing of his courtesy or good-humour. By the by, I must tell you, that\r\nat an early period of the conversation, upon my saying, 'I put all other\r\nconsiderations out of the question, and first propose to you the injustice\r\nof the system alone,' 'Oh!' replied my friend, the Doctor, 'if you put it\r\nupon that ground, you _stump_ the question at once; I have nothing to say\r\nto that whatever, but,' and then followed the usual train of\r\npleadings--happiness, tenderness, care, indulgence, &c., &c., &c.--all the\r\nsubstitutes that may or may not be put in the place of _justice_, and\r\nwhich these slaveholders attempt to persuade others, and perhaps\r\nthemselves, effectually supply its want. After church hours the people\r\ncame back from Darien. They are only permitted to go to Darien to church\r\nonce a month. On the intermediate Sundays they assemble in the house of\r\nLondon, Mr. ----'s head cooper, an excellent and pious man, who, Heaven\r\nalone knows how, has obtained some little knowledge of reading, and who\r\nreads prayers and the Bible to his fellow slaves, and addresses them with\r\nextemporaneous exhortations. I have the greatest desire to attend one of\r\nthese religious meetings, but fear to put the people under any, the\r\nslightest restraint. However, I shall see, by and by, how they feel about\r\nit themselves.\r\n\r\nYou have heard, of course, many and contradictory statements as to the\r\ndegree of religious instruction afforded to the negroes of the South, and\r\ntheir opportunities of worship, &c. Until the late abolition movement, the\r\nspiritual interests of the slaves were about as little regarded as their\r\nphysical necessities. The outcry which has been raised with threefold\r\nforce within the last few years against the whole system, has induced its\r\nupholders and defenders to adopt, as measures of personal extenuation,\r\nsome appearance of religious instruction (such as it is), and some\r\npretence at physical indulgences (such as they are), bestowed apparently\r\nvoluntarily upon their dependants. At Darien, a church is appropriated to\r\nthe especial use of the slaves, who are almost all of them Baptists here;\r\nand a gentleman officiates in it (of course white), who, I understand, is\r\nvery zealous in the cause of their spiritual well-being. He, like most\r\nSouthern men, clergy or others, jump the present life in their charities\r\nto the slaves, and go on to furnish them with all requisite conveniences\r\nfor the next. There were a short time ago two free black preachers in this\r\nneighbourhood, but they have lately been ejected from the place. I could\r\nnot clearly learn, but one may possibly imagine, upon what grounds.\r\n\r\nI do not think that a residence on a slave plantation is likely to be\r\npeculiarly advantageous to a child like my eldest. I was observing her\r\nto-day among her swarthy worshippers, for they follow her as such, and\r\nsaw, with dismay, the universal eagerness with which they sprang to obey\r\nher little gestures of command. She said something about a swing, and in\r\nless than five minutes head-man Frank had erected it for her, and a\r\ndozen young slaves were ready to swing little 'missis.' ----, think of\r\nlearning to rule despotically your fellow creatures before the first\r\nlesson of self-government has been well spelt over! It makes me tremble;\r\nbut I shall find a remedy, or remove myself and the child from this\r\nmisery and ruin.\r\n\r\nYou cannot conceive anything more grotesque than the Sunday trim of the\r\npoor people; their ideality, as Mr. Combe would say, being, I should\r\nthink, twice as big as any rational bump in their head. Their Sabbath\r\ntoilet really presents the most ludicrous combination of incongruities\r\nthat you can conceive--frills, flounces, ribbands, combs stuck in their\r\nwoolly heads, as if they held up any portion of the stiff and ungovernable\r\nhair, filthy finery, every colour in the rainbow, and the deepest possible\r\nshades blended in fierce companionship round one dusky visage, head\r\nhandkerchiefs, that put one's very eyes out from a mile off, chintzes with\r\nsprawling patterns, that might be seen if the clouds were printed with\r\nthem--beads, bugles, flaring sashes, and above all, little fanciful\r\naprons, which finish these incongruous toilets with a sort of airy grace,\r\nwhich I assure you is perfectly indescribable. One young man, the eldest\r\nson and heir of our washerwoman Hannah, came to pay his respects to me in\r\na magnificent black satin waistcoat, shirt gills which absolutely\r\nengulphed his black visage, and neither shoes nor stockings on his feet.\r\n\r\nAmong our visitors from St. Simons to-day was Hannah's mother (it seems to\r\nme that there is not a girl of sixteen on the plantations but has\r\nchildren, nor a woman of thirty but has grandchildren). Old House Molly,\r\nas she is called, from the circumstance of her having been one of the\r\nslaves employed in domestic offices during Major ----'s residence on the\r\nisland, is one of the oldest and most respected slaves on the estate, and\r\nwas introduced to me by Mr. ---- with especial marks of attention and\r\nregard; she absolutely embraced him, and seemed unable sufficiently to\r\nexpress her ecstacy at seeing him again. Her dress, like that of her\r\ndaughter, and all the servants who have at any time been employed about\r\nthe family, bore witness to a far more improved taste than the half savage\r\nadornment of the other poor blacks, and upon my observing to her how\r\nagreeable her neat and cleanly appearance was to me, she replied, that her\r\nold master (Major ----) was extremely particular in this respect, and that\r\nin his time all the house servants were obliged to be very nice and\r\ncareful about their persons.\r\n\r\nShe named to me all her children, an immense tribe; and, by the by, E----,\r\nit has occurred to me that whereas the increase of this ill-fated race is\r\nfrequently adduced as a proof of their good treatment and well being, it\r\nreally and truly is no such thing, and springs from quite other causes\r\nthan the peace and plenty which a rapidly increasing population are\r\nsupposed to indicate. If you will reflect for a moment upon the overgrown\r\nfamilies of the half-starved Irish peasantry and English manufacturers,\r\nyou will agree with me that these prolific shoots by no means necessarily\r\nspring from a rich or healthy soil. Peace and plenty are certainly causes\r\nof human increase, and so is recklessness; and this, I take it, is the\r\nimpulse in the instance of the English manufacturer, the Irish peasant,\r\nand the negro slave. Indeed here it is more than recklessness, for there\r\nare certain indirect premiums held out to obey the early commandment of\r\nreplenishing the earth, which do not fail to have their full effect. In\r\nthe first place, none of the cares, those noble cares, that holy\r\nthoughtfulness which lifts the human above the brute parent, are ever\r\nincurred here by either father or mother. The relation indeed resembles,\r\nas far as circumstances can possibly make it do so, the short-lived\r\nconnection between the animal and its young. The father, having neither\r\nauthority, power, responsibility, or charge in his children, is of course,\r\nas among brutes, the least attached to his offspring; the mother, by the\r\nnatural law which renders the infant dependent on her for its first year's\r\nnourishment, is more so; but as neither of them is bound to educate or to\r\nsupport their children, all the unspeakable tenderness and solemnity, all\r\nthe rational, and all the spiritual grace and glory of the connection is\r\nlost, and it becomes mere breeding, bearing, suckling, and there an end.\r\nBut it is not only the absence of the conditions which God has affixed to\r\nthe relation, which tends to encourage the reckless increase of the race;\r\nthey enjoy, by means of numerous children, certain positive advantages. In\r\nthe first place, every woman who is pregnant, as soon as she chooses to\r\nmake the fact known to the overseer, is relieved of a certain portion of\r\nher work in the field, which lightening of labour continues, of course, as\r\nlong as she is so burthened. On the birth of a child certain additions of\r\nclothing and an additional weekly ration are bestowed on the family; and\r\nthese matters, small as they may seem, act as powerful inducements to\r\ncreatures who have none of the restraining influences actuating them\r\nwhich belong to the parental relation among all other people, whether\r\ncivilised or savage. Moreover, they have all of them a most distinct and\r\nperfect knowledge of their value to their owners as property; and a woman\r\nthinks, and not much amiss, that the more frequently she adds to the\r\nnumber of her master's live stock by bringing new slaves into the world,\r\nthe more claims she will have upon his consideration and goodwill. This\r\nwas perfectly evident to me from the meritorious air with which the women\r\nalways made haste to inform me of the number of children they had borne,\r\nand the frequent occasions on which the older slaves would direct my\r\nattention to their children, exclaiming, 'Look, missis! little niggers for\r\nyou and massa, plenty little niggers for you and little missis!' A very\r\nagreeable apostrophe to me indeed, as you will believe.\r\n\r\nI have let this letter lie for a day or two, dear, E---- from press of\r\nmore immediate avocations. I have nothing very particular to add to it. On\r\nMonday evening I rowed over to Darien with Mr. ---- to fetch over the\r\ndoctor, who was coming to visit some of our people. As I sat waiting in\r\nthe boat for the return of the gentlemen, the sun went down, or rather\r\nseemed to dissolve bodily into the glowing clouds, which appeared but a\r\nfusion of the great orb of light; the stars twinkled out in the\r\nrose-coloured sky, and the evening air, as it fanned the earth to sleep,\r\nwas as soft as a summer's evening breeze in the north. A sort of dreamy\r\nstillness seemed creeping over the world and into my spirit, as the canoe\r\njust tilted against the steps that led to the wharf, raised by the scarce\r\nperceptible heaving of the water. A melancholy, monotonous boat-horn\r\nsounded from a distance up the stream, and presently, floating slowly down\r\nwith the current, huge, shapeless, black relieved against the sky, came\r\none of those rough barges piled with cotton, called, hereabouts, Ocone\r\nboxes. The vessel itself is really nothing but a monstrous square box,\r\nmade of rough planks, put together in the roughest manner possible to\r\nattain the necessary object of keeping the cotton dry. Upon this great\r\ntray are piled the swollen apoplectic looking cotton bags, to the height\r\nof ten, twelve, and fourteen feet. This huge water-waggon floats lazily\r\ndown the river, from the upper country to Darien. They are flat bottomed,\r\nand, of course, draw little water. The stream from whence they are named\r\nis an up country river, which, by its junction with the Ocmulgee, forms\r\nthe Altamaha. Here at least, you perceive the Indian names remain, and\r\nlong may they do so, for they seem to me to become the very character of\r\nthe streams and mountains they indicate, and are indeed significant to the\r\nlearned in savage tongues, which is more than can be said of such titles\r\nas Jones's Creek, Onion Creek, &c. These Ocone boxes are broken up at\r\nDarien, where the cotton is shipped either for the Savannah, Charleston\r\nor Liverpool markets, and the timber, of which they are constructed,\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nWe rowed the doctor over to see some of his patients on the island, and\r\nbefore his departure a most animated discussion took place upon the\r\nsubject of the President of the United States, his talents,\r\nqualifications, opinions, above all, his views with regard to the slave\r\nsystem. Mr. ----, who you know is no abolitionist, and is a very devoted\r\nVan Buren man, maintained with great warmth the President's\r\nstraight-forwardness, and his evident and expressed intention of\r\nprotecting the rights of the South. The doctor, on the other hand, quoted\r\na certain speech of the President's, upon the question of abolishing\r\nslavery in the district of Columbia, which his fears interpreted into a\r\nmere evasion of the matter, and an indication that, at some future period,\r\nhe (Mr. Van Buren), might take a different view of the subject. I confess,\r\nfor my own part, that if the doctor quoted the speech right, and if the\r\nPresident is not an honest man, and if I were a Southern slave holder, I\r\nshould not feel altogether secure of Mr. Van Buren's present opinions or\r\nfuture conduct upon this subject. These three _ifs_, however, are material\r\npoints of consideration. Our friend the doctor inclined vehemently to Mr.\r\nClay, as one on whom the slave holders could depend. Georgia, however, as\r\na state, is perhaps the most democratic in the Union; though here, as well\r\nas in other places, that you and I know of, a certain class, calling\r\nthemselves the first, and honestly believing themselves the best, set\r\ntheir faces against the modern fashioned republicanism, professing, and, I\r\nhave no doubt, with great sincerity, that their ideas of democracy are\r\naltogether of a different kind.\r\n\r\nI went again to-day to the Infirmary, and was happy to perceive that there\r\nreally was an evident desire to conform to my instructions, and keep the\r\nplace in a better condition than formerly. Among the sick I found a poor\r\nwoman suffering dreadfully from the ear-ache. She had done nothing to\r\nalleviate her pain but apply some leaves, of what tree or plant I could\r\nnot ascertain, and tie up her head in a variety of dirty cloths, till it\r\nwas as large as her whole body. I removed all these, and found one side of\r\nher face and neck very much swollen, but so begrimed with filth that it\r\nwas really no very agreeable task to examine it. The first process, of\r\ncourse, was washing, which, however, appeared to her so very unusual an\r\noperation, that I had to perform it for her myself. Sweet oil and\r\nlaudanum, and raw cotton, being then applied to her ear and neck, she\r\nprofessed herself much relieved, but I believe in my heart that the warm\r\nwater sponging had done her more good than anything else. I was sorry not\r\nto ascertain what leaves she had applied to her ear. These simple remedies\r\nresorted to by savages, and people as ignorant, are generally approved by\r\nexperience, and sometimes condescendingly adopted by science. I remember\r\nonce, when Mr. ---- was suffering from a severe attack of inflammatory\r\nrheumatism, Doctor C---- desired him to bind round his knee the leaves of\r\nthe tulip-tree--poplar, I believe you call it--saying that he had learnt\r\nthat remedy from the negroes in Virginia, and found it a most effectual\r\none. My next agreeable office in the Infirmary this morning was\r\nsuperintending the washing of two little babies, whose mothers were\r\nnursing them with quite as much ignorance as zeal. Having ordered a large\r\ntub of water, I desired Rose to undress the little creatures and give them\r\na warm bath; the mothers looked on in unutterable dismay, and one of them,\r\njust as her child was going to be put into the tub, threw into it all the\r\nclothes she had just taken off it, as she said, to break the unusual shock\r\nof the warm water. I immediately rescued them, not but what they were\r\nquite as much in want of washing as the baby, but it appeared, upon\r\nenquiry, that the woman had none others to dress the child in, when it\r\nshould have taken its bath; they were immediately wrung and hung by the\r\nfire to dry, and the poor little patients having undergone this novel\r\noperation were taken out and given to their mothers. Anything, however,\r\nmuch more helpless and inefficient than these poor ignorant creatures you\r\ncannot conceive; they actually seemed incapable of drying or dressing\r\ntheir own babies, and I had to finish their toilet myself. As it is only a\r\nvery few years since the most absurd and disgusting customs have become\r\nexploded among ourselves, you will not, of course, wonder that these poor\r\npeople pin up the lower part of their infants, bodies, legs and all, in\r\nred flannel as soon as they are born, and keep them in the selfsame\r\nenvelope till it literally falls off.\r\n\r\nIn the next room I found a woman lying on the floor in a fit of epilepsy,\r\nbarking most violently. She seemed to excite no particular attention or\r\ncompassion; the women said she was subject to these fits, and took little\r\nor no notice of her, as she lay barking like some enraged animal on the\r\nground. Again I stood in profound ignorance, sickening with the sight of\r\nsuffering, which I knew not how to alleviate, and which seemed to excite\r\nno commiseration, merely from the sad fact of its frequent occurrence.\r\nReturning to the house, I passed up the 'street.' It was between eleven\r\no'clock and noon, and the people were taking their first meal in the day.\r\nBy the by, E----, how do you think Berkshire county farmers would relish\r\nlabouring hard all day upon _two meals_ of Indian corn or hominy? Such is\r\nthe regulation on this plantation, however, and I beg you to bear in mind\r\nthat the negroes on Mr. ----'s estate, are generally considered well off.\r\nThey go to the fields at daybreak, carrying with them their allowance of\r\nfood for the day, which towards noon, _and not till then_, they eat,\r\ncooking it over a fire, which they kindle as best they can, where they are\r\nworking. Their second meal in the day is at night, after their labour is\r\nover, having worked, at the _very least_, six hours without intermission\r\nof rest or refreshment since their noon-day meal (properly so called, for\r\n'tis meal, and nothing else). Those that I passed to-day, sitting on their\r\ndoorsteps, or on the ground round them eating, were the people employed at\r\nthe mill and threshing-floor. As these are near to the settlement, they\r\nhad time to get their food from the cook-shop. Chairs, tables, plates,\r\nknives, forks, they had none; they sat, as I before said, on the earth or\r\ndoorsteps, and ate either out of their little cedar tubs, or an iron pot,\r\nsome few with broken iron spoons, more with pieces of wood, and all the\r\nchildren with their fingers. A more complete sample of savage feeding, I\r\nnever beheld. At one of the doors I saw three young girls standing, who\r\nmight be between sixteen and seventeen years old; they had evidently done\r\neatings and were rudely playing and romping with each other, laughing and\r\nshouting like wild things. I went into the house, and such another\r\nspectacle of filthy disorder I never beheld. I then addressed the girls\r\nmost solemnly, showing them that they were wasting in idle riot the time\r\nin which they might be rendering their abode decent, and told them that it\r\nwas a shame for any woman to live in so dirty a place, and so beastly a\r\ncondition. They said they had seen buckree (white) women's houses just as\r\ndirty, and they could not be expected to be cleaner than white women. I\r\nthen told them that the only difference between themselves and buckree\r\nwomen was, that the latter were generally better informed, and, for that\r\nreason alone, it was more disgraceful to them to be disorderly and dirty.\r\nThey seemed to listen to me attentively, and one of them exclaimed, with\r\ngreat satisfaction, that they saw I made no difference between them and\r\nwhite girls, and that they never had been so treated before. I do not know\r\nanything which strikes me as a more melancholy illustration of the\r\ndegradation of these people, than the animal nature of their recreations\r\nin their short seasons of respite from labour. You see them, boys and\r\ngirls, from the youngest age to seventeen and eighteen, rolling, tumbling,\r\nkicking, and wallowing in the dust, regardless alike of decency, and\r\nincapable of any more rational amusement; or, lolling, with half-closed\r\neyes, like so many cats and dogs, against a wall, or upon a bank in the\r\nsun, dozing away their short leisure hour, until called to resume their\r\nlabours in the field or the mill. After this description of the meals of\r\nour labourers, you will, perhaps, be curious to know how it fares with our\r\nhouse servants in this respect. Precisely in the same manner, as far as\r\nregards allowance, with the exception of what is left from our table, but,\r\nif possible, with even less comfort, in one respect, inasmuch as no time\r\nwhatever is set apart for their meals, which they snatch at any hour, and\r\nin any way that they can--generally, however, standing, or squatting on\r\ntheir hams round the kitchen fire. They have no sleeping-rooms in the\r\nhouse, but when their work is over, retire, like the rest, to their\r\nhovels, the discomfort of which has to them all the addition of comparison\r\nwith our mode of living. Now, in all establishments whatever, of course\r\nsome disparity exists between the comforts of the drawing-room and best\r\nbed-rooms, and the servant's hall and attics, but here it is no longer a\r\nmatter of degree. The young woman who performs the office of lady's-maid,\r\nand the lads who wait upon us at table, have neither table to feed at nor\r\nchair to sit down upon themselves. The boys sleep at night on the hearth\r\nby the kitchen fire, and the women upon a rough board bedstead, strewed\r\nwith a little tree moss. All this shows how very torpid the sense of\r\njustice is apt to lie in the breasts of those who have it not awakened by\r\nthe peremptory demands of others.\r\n\r\nIn the north we could not hope to keep the worst and poorest servant for\r\na single day in the wretched discomfort in which our negro servants are\r\nforced habitually to live. I received a visit this morning from some of\r\nthe Darien people. Among them was a most interesting young person, from\r\nwhose acquaintance, if I have any opportunity of cultivating it, I\r\npromise myself much pleasure. The ladies that I have seen since I\r\ncrossed the southern line, have all seemed to me extremely sickly in\r\ntheir appearance--delicate in the refined term, but unfortunately sickly\r\nin the truer one. They are languid in their deportment and speech, and\r\nseem to give themselves up, without an effort to counteract it, to the\r\nenervating effect of their warm climate. It is undoubtedly a most\r\nrelaxing and unhealthy one, and therefore requires the more imperatively\r\nto be met by energetic and invigorating habits both of body and mind. Of\r\nthese, however, the southern ladies appear to have, at present, no very\r\npositive idea. Doctor ---- told us to-day of a comical application which\r\nhis negro man had made to him for the coat he was then wearing. I forget\r\nwhether the fellow wanted the loan, or the absolute gift of it, but his\r\nargument was (it might have been an Irishman's) that he knew his master\r\nintended to give it to him by and by, and that he thought he might as\r\nwell let him have it at once, as keep him waiting any longer for it.\r\nThis story the Doctor related with great glee, and it furnishes a very\r\ngood sample of what the Southerners are fond of exhibiting, the degree\r\nof licence to which they capriciously permit their favourite slaves\r\noccasionally to carry their familiarity. They seem to consider it as an\r\nundeniable proof of the general kindness with which their dependents are\r\ntreated. It is as good a proof of it as the maudlin tenderness of a fine\r\nlady to her lap-dog is of her humane treatment of animals in general.\r\nServants whose claims to respect are properly understood by themselves\r\nand their employers, are not made pets, playthings, jesters, or\r\ncompanions of, and it is only the degradation of the many that admits of\r\nthis favouritism to the few--a system of favouritism which, as it is\r\nperfectly consistent with the profoundest contempt and injustice,\r\ndegrades the object of it quite as much, though it oppresses him less,\r\nthan the cruelty practised upon his fellows. I had several of these\r\nfavourite slaves presented to me, and one or two little negro children,\r\nwho their owners assured me were quite pets. The only real service which\r\nthis arbitrary goodwill did to the objects of it was quite involuntary\r\nand unconscious on the part of their kind masters--I mean the inevitable\r\nimprovement in intelligence, which resulted to them from being more\r\nconstantly admitted to the intercourse of the favoured white race.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to tell you of a magnificent bald-headed eagle which\r\nMr. ---- called me to look at early this morning. I had never before seen\r\nalive one of these national types of yours, and stood entranced as the\r\nnoble creature swept, like a black cloud, over the river, his bald white\r\nhead bent forward and shining in the sun, and his fierce eyes and beak\r\ndirected towards one of the beautiful wild ducks on the water, which he\r\nhad evidently marked for his prey. The poor little duck, who was not\r\nambitious of such a glorification, dived, and the eagle hovered above the\r\nspot. After a short interval, its victim rose to the surface several\r\nyards nearer shore. The great king of birds stooped nearer, and again the\r\nwatery shield was interposed. This went on until the poor water-fowl,\r\ndriven by excess of fear into unwonted boldness, rose, after repeatedly\r\ndiving, within a short distance of where we stood. The eagle, who, I\r\npresume, had read how we were to have dominion over the fowls of the air\r\n(bald-headed eagles included), hovered sulkily awhile over the river, and\r\nthen sailing slowly towards the woods on the opposite shore, alighted and\r\nfurled his great wings on a huge cypress limb, that stretched itself out\r\nagainst the blue sky, like the arm of a giant, for the giant bird to\r\nperch upon.\r\n\r\nI am amusing myself by attempting to beautify, in some sort, this\r\nresidence of ours. Immediately at the back of it runs a ditch, about three\r\nfeet wide, which empties and fills twice a day with the tide. This lies\r\nlike a moat on two sides of the house. The opposite bank is a steep dyke,\r\nwith a footpath along the top. One or two willows droop over this very\r\ninteresting ditch, and I thought I would add to their company some\r\nmagnolias and myrtles, and so make a little evergreen plantation round the\r\nhouse. I went to the swamp reserves I have before mentioned to you, and\r\nchose some beautiful bushes--among others, a very fine young pine, at\r\nwhich our overseer and all the negroes expressed much contemptuous\r\nsurprise; for though the tree is beautiful, it is also common, and with\r\nthem, as with wiser folk 'tis 'nothing pleases but rare accidents.' In\r\nspite of their disparaging remarks, however, I persisted in having my pine\r\ntree planted; and I assure you it formed a very pleasing variety among the\r\nbroad smooth leaved evergreens about it. While forming my plantation I had\r\na brand thrown into a bed of tall yellow sedges which screen the brimming\r\nwaters of the noble river from our parlour window, and which I therefore\r\nwished removed. The small sample of a southern conflagration which ensued\r\nwas very picturesque, the flames devouring the light growth, absolutely\r\nlicking it off the ground, while the curling smoke drew off in misty\r\nwreaths across the river. The heat was intense, and I thought how\r\nexceedingly and unpleasantly warm one must feel in the midst of such a\r\nforest burning, as Cooper describes. Having worked my appointed task in\r\nthe garden, I rowed over to Darien and back, the rosy sunset changing\r\nmeantime to starry evening, as beautiful as the first the sky ever was\r\narrayed in.\r\n\r\nI saw an advertisement this morning in the paper, which occasioned me much\r\nthought. Mr. J---- C---- and a Mr. N----, two planters of this\r\nneighbourhood, have contracted to dig a canal, called the Brunswick canal,\r\nand not having hands enough for the work, advertise at the same time for\r\nnegroes on hires and for Irish labourers. Now the Irishmen are to have\r\ntwenty dollars a month wages, and to be 'found' (to use the technical\r\nphrase,) which finding means abundant food, and the best accommodations\r\nwhich can be procured for them. The negroes are hired from their masters,\r\nwho will be paid of course as high a price as they can obtain for\r\nthem--probably a very high one, as the demand for them is urgent--they, in\r\nthe meantime, receiving no wages, and nothing more than the miserable\r\nnegro fare of rice and corn grits. Of course the Irishmen and these slaves\r\nare not allowed to work together, but are kept at separate stations on the\r\ncanal. This is every way politic, for the low Irish seem to have the same\r\nsort of hatred of negroes which sects, differing but little in their\r\ntenets, have for each other. The fact is, that a condition in their own\r\ncountry nearly similar, has made the poor Irish almost as degraded a class\r\nof beings as the negroes are here, and their insolence towards them, and\r\nhatred of them, are precisely in proportion to the resemblance between\r\nthem. This hiring out of negroes is a horrid aggravation of the miseries\r\nof their condition, for, if on the plantations, and under the masters to\r\nwhom they belong, their labour is severe, and their food inadequate, think\r\nwhat it must be when they are hired out for a stipulated sum to a\r\ntemporary employer, who has not even the interest which it is pretended an\r\nowner may feel in the welfare of his slaves, but whose chief aim it must\r\nnecessarily be to get as much out of them, and expend as little on them,\r\nas possible. Ponder this new form of iniquity, and believe me ever your\r\nmost sincerely attached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. After finishing my last letter to you, I went out into the\r\nclear starlight to breathe the delicious mildness of the air, and was\r\nsurprised to hear rising from one of the houses of the settlement a hymn\r\nsung apparently by a number of voices. The next morning I enquired the\r\nmeaning of this, and was informed that those negroes on the plantation who\r\nwere members of the Church, were holding a prayer-meeting. There is an\r\nimmensely strong devotional feeling among these poor people. The worst of\r\nit is, that it is zeal without understanding, and profits them but\r\nlittle; yet light is light, even that poor portion that may stream\r\nthrough a key-hole, and I welcome this most ignorant profession of\r\nreligion in Mr. ----'s dependents, as the herald of better and brighter\r\nthings for them. Some of the planters are entirely inimical to any such\r\nproceedings, and neither allow their negroes to attend worship, or to\r\ncongregate together for religious purposes, and truly I think they are\r\nwise in their own generation. On other plantations, again, the same rigid\r\ndiscipline is not observed; and some planters and overseers go even\r\nfarther than toleration; and encourage these devotional exercises and\r\nprofessions of religion, having actually discovered that a man may become\r\nmore faithful and trustworthy even as a slave, who acknowledges the\r\nhigher influences of Christianity, no matter in how small a degree.\r\nSlave-holding clergymen, and certain piously inclined planters, undertake,\r\naccordingly, to enlighten these poor creatures upon these matters, with a\r\nsafe understanding, however, of what truth is to be given to them, and\r\nwhat is not; how much they may learn to become better slaves, and how\r\nmuch they may not learn, lest they cease to be slaves at all. The process\r\nis a very ticklish one, and but for the northern public opinion, which is\r\nnow pressing the slaveholders close, I dare say would not be attempted at\r\nall. As it is, they are putting their own throats and their own souls in\r\njeopardy by this very endeavour to serve God and Mammon. The light that\r\nthey are letting in between their fingers will presently strike them\r\nblind, and the mighty flood of truth which they are straining through a\r\nsieve to the thirsty lips of their slaves, sweep them away like straws\r\nfrom their cautious moorings, and overwhelm them in its great deeps, to\r\nthe waters of which man may in nowise say, thus far shall ye come and no\r\nfarther. The community I now speak of, the white population of Darien,\r\nshould be a religious one, to judge by the number of Churches it\r\nmaintains. However, we know the old proverb, and, at that rate, it may\r\nnot be so godly after all. Mr. ---- and his brother have been called upon\r\nat various times to subscribe to them all; and I saw this morning a most\r\nfervent appeal, extremely ill-spelled, from a gentleman living in the\r\nneighbourhood of the town, and whose slaves are notoriously ill-treated;\r\nreminding Mr. ---- of the precious souls of his human cattle, and\r\nrequesting a further donation for the Baptist Church, of which most of\r\nthe people here are members. Now this man is known to be a hard master;\r\nhis negro houses are sheds, not fit to stable beasts in, his slaves are\r\nragged, half-naked and miserable--yet he is urgent for their religious\r\ncomforts, and writes to Mr. ---- about 'their souls, their precious\r\nsouls.' He was over here a few days ago, and pressed me very much to\r\nattend his church. I told him I would not go to a church where the people\r\nwho worked for us were parted off from us, as if they had the pest, and\r\nwe should catch it of them. I asked him, for I was curious to know, how\r\nthey managed to administer the Sacrament to a mixed congregation? He\r\nreplied, Oh! very easily; that the white portion of the assembly received\r\nit first, and the blacks afterwards. 'A new commandment I give unto you,\r\nthat ye love one another, even as I have loved you.' Oh, what a shocking\r\nmockery! However, they show their faith at all events, in the declaration\r\nthat God is no respecter of persons, since they do not pretend to exclude\r\nfrom His table those whom they most certainly would not admit to their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI have as usual allowed this letter to lie by, dear E----, not in the hope\r\nof the occurrence of any event--for that is hopeless--but until my daily\r\navocations allowed me leisure to resume it, and afforded me, at the same\r\ntime, matter wherewith to do so. I really never was so busy in all my\r\nlife, as I am here. I sit at the receipt of custom (involuntarily enough)\r\nfrom morning till night--no time, no place, affords me a respite from my\r\ninnumerable petitioners, and whether I be asleep or awake, reading,\r\neating, or walking; in the kitchen, my bed-room, or the parlour, they\r\nflock in with urgent entreaties, and pitiful stories, and my conscience\r\nforbids my ever postponing their business for any other matter; for, with\r\nshame and grief of heart I say it, by their unpaid labour I live--their\r\nnakedness clothes me, and their heavy toil maintains me in luxurious\r\nidleness. Surely the least I can do is to hear these, my most injured\r\nbenefactors; and, indeed, so intense in me is the sense of the injury they\r\nreceive from me and mine, that I should scarce dare refuse them the very\r\nclothes from my back, or food from my plate, if they asked me for it. In\r\ntaking my daily walk round the banks yesterday, I found that I was walking\r\nover violet roots. The season is too little advanced for them to be in\r\nbloom, and I could not find out whether they were the fragrant violet or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- has been much gratified to-day by the arrival of Mr. K----, who,\r\nwith his father, for nineteen years was the sole manager of these\r\nestates, and discharged his laborious task with great ability and\r\nfidelity towards his employers. How far he understood his duties to the\r\nslaves, or whether indeed an overseer can, in the nature of things,\r\nacknowledge any duty to them, is another question. He is a remarkable man\r\nand is much respected for his integrity and honourable dealing by\r\neverybody here. His activity and energy are wonderful, and the mere fact\r\nof his having charge of for nineteen years, and personally governing,\r\nwithout any assistance whatever, seven hundred people scattered over\r\nthree large tracts of land, at a considerable distance from each other,\r\ncertainly bespeaks efficiency and energy of a very uncommon order. The\r\ncharacter I had heard of him from Mr. ---- had excited a great deal of\r\ninterest in me, and I was very glad of this opportunity of seeing a man\r\nwho, for so many years, had been sovereign over the poor people here. I\r\nmet him walking on the banks with Mr. ----, as I returned from my own\r\nramble, during which nothing occurred or appeared to interest me--except,\r\nby the by, my unexpectedly coming quite close to one of those magnificent\r\nscarlet birds which abound here, and which dart across your path, like a\r\nwinged flame. Nothing can surpass the beauty of their plumage, and their\r\nvoice is excellently melodious--they are lovely.\r\n\r\nMy companions, when I do not request the attendance of my friend Jack, are\r\na couple of little terriers, who are endowed to perfection with the\r\nugliness and the intelligence of their race--they are of infinite service\r\non the plantation, as, owing to the immense quantity of grain, and chaff,\r\nand such matters, rats and mice abound in the mills and storehouses. I\r\ncrossed the threshing floor to-day--a very large square, perfectly level,\r\nraised by artificial means, about half a foot from the ground, and covered\r\nequally all over, so as to lie quite smooth, with some preparation of tar.\r\nIt lies immediately between the house and the steam mill, and on it much\r\nof the negroes' work is done--the first threshing is given to the rice,\r\nand other labours are carried on. As I walked across it to-day, passing\r\nthrough the busy groups, chiefly of women, that covered it, I came\r\nopposite to one of the drivers, who held in his hand his whip, the odious\r\ninsignia of his office. I took it from him; it was a short stick of\r\nmoderate size, with a thick square leather thong attached to it. As I held\r\nit in my hand, I did not utter a word; but I conclude, as is often the\r\ncase, my face spoke what my tongue did not, for the driver said, 'Oh!\r\nMissis, me use it for measure--me seldom strike nigger with it.' For one\r\nmoment I thought I must carry the hateful implement into the house with\r\nme. An instant's reflection, however, served to show me how useless such a\r\nproceeding would be. The people are not mine, nor their drivers, nor their\r\nwhips. I should but have impeded, for a few hours, the man's customary\r\noffice, and a new scourge would have been easily provided, and I should\r\nhave done nothing, perhaps worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I had a most interesting conversation with Mr. K----. Among\r\nother subjects, he gave me a lively and curious description of the\r\nYeomanry of Georgia--more properly termed pine-landers. Have you visions\r\nnow of well-to-do farmers with comfortable homesteads, decent habits,\r\nindustrious, intelligent, cheerful, and thrifty? Such, however, is not the\r\nYeomanry of Georgia. Labour being here the especial portion of slaves, it\r\nis thenceforth degraded, and considered unworthy of all but slaves. No\r\nwhite man, therefore, of any class puts hand to work of any kind soever.\r\nThis is an exceedingly dignified way of proving their gentility, for the\r\nlazy planters who prefer an idle life of semi-starvation and barbarism to\r\nthe degradation of doing anything themselves; but the effect on the poorer\r\nwhites of the country is terrible. I speak now of the scattered white\r\npopulation, who, too poor to possess land or slaves, and having no means\r\nof living in the towns, squat (most appropriately is it so termed) either\r\non other men's land or government districts--always here swamp or pine\r\nbarren--and claim masterdom over the place they invade, till ejected by\r\nthe rightful proprietors. These wretched creatures will not, for they are\r\nwhites (and labour belongs to blacks and slaves alone here), labour for\r\ntheir own subsistence. They are hardly protected from the weather by the\r\nrude shelters they frame for themselves in the midst of these dreary\r\nwoods. Their food is chiefly supplied by shooting the wild fowl and\r\nvenison, and stealing from the cultivated patches of the plantations\r\nnearest at hand. Their clothes hang about them in filthy tatters, and the\r\ncombined squalor and fierceness of their appearance is really frightful.\r\n\r\nThis population is the direct growth of slavery. The planters are loud in\r\ntheir execrations of these miserable vagabonds; yet they do not see that,\r\nso long as labour is considered the disgraceful portion of slaves, these\r\nfree men will hold it nobler to starve or steal than till the earth with\r\nnone but the despised blacks for fellow-labourers. The blacks\r\nthemselves--such is the infinite power of custom--acquiesce in this\r\nnotion, and, as I have told you, consider it the lowest degradation in a\r\nwhite to use any exertion. I wonder, considering the burthens they have\r\nseen me lift, the digging, the planting, the rowing, and the walking I do,\r\nthat they do not utterly contemn me, and indeed they seem lost in\r\namazement at it.\r\n\r\nTalking of these pine-landers--gypsies, without any of the romantic\r\nassociations that belong to the latter people--led us to the origin of\r\nsuch a population, slavery; and you may be sure I listened with infinite\r\ninterest to the opinions of a man of uncommon shrewdness and sagacity, who\r\nwas born in the very bosom of it, and has passed his whole life among\r\nslaves. If any one is competent to judge of its effects, such a man is\r\nthe one; and this was his verdict, 'I hate slavery with all my heart; I\r\nconsider it an absolute curse wherever it exists. It will keep those\r\nstates where it does exist fifty years behind the others in improvement\r\nand prosperity.' Further on in the conversation, he made this most\r\nremarkable observation, 'As for its being an irremediable evil--a thing\r\nnot to be helped or got rid of--that's all nonsense; for as soon as people\r\nbecome convinced that it is their interest to get rid of it, they will\r\nsoon find the means to do so, depend upon it.' And undoubtedly this is\r\ntrue. This is not an age, nor yours a country, where a large mass of\r\npeople will long endure what they perceive to be injurious to their\r\nfortunes and advancement. Blind as people often are to their highest and\r\ntruest interests, your country folk have generally shown remarkable\r\nacuteness in finding out where their worldly progress suffered let or\r\nhindrance, and have removed it with laudable alacrity. Now, the fact is\r\nnot at all as we at the north are sometimes told, that the southern\r\nslaveholders deprecate the evils of slavery quite as much as we do; that\r\nthey see all its miseries; that, moreover, they are most anxious to get\r\nrid of the whole thing, but want the means to do so, and submit most\r\nunwillingly to a necessity from which they cannot extricate themselves.\r\nAll this I thought might be true, before I went to the south, and often\r\nhas the charitable supposition checked the condemnation which was\r\nindignantly rising to my lips against these murderers of their brethren's\r\npeace. A little reflection, however, even without personal observation,\r\nmight have convinced me that this could not be the case. If the majority\r\nof Southerners were satisfied that slavery was contrary to their worldly\r\nfortunes, slavery would be at an end from that very moment; but the fact\r\nis--and I have it not only from observation of my own, but from the\r\ndistinct statement of some of the most intelligent southern men that I\r\nhave conversed with--the only obstacle to immediate abolition throughout\r\nthe south is the immense value of the human property, and, to use the\r\nwords of a very distinguished Carolinian, who thus ended a long discussion\r\nwe had on the subject, 'I'll tell you why abolition is impossible: because\r\nevery healthy negro can fetch a thousand dollars in the Charleston market\r\nat this moment.' And this opinion, you see, tallies perfectly with the\r\ntestimony of Mr. K----.\r\n\r\nHe went on to speak of several of the slaves on this estate, as persons\r\nquite remarkable for their fidelity and intelligence, instancing old\r\nMolly, Ned the engineer, who has the superintendence of the steam-engine\r\nin the rice-mill, and head-man Frank, of whom indeed, he wound up the\r\neulogium by saying, he had quite the principles of a white man--which I\r\nthought most equivocal praise, but he did not intend it as such. As I was\r\ncomplaining to Mr. ---- of the terribly neglected condition of the dykes,\r\nwhich are in some parts so overgrown with gigantic briars that 'tis\r\nreally impossible to walk over them, and the trench on one hand, and river\r\non the other, afford one extremely disagreeable alternatives. Mr. K----\r\ncautioned me to be particularly on my guard not to step on the thorns of\r\nthe orange tree. These, indeed, are formidable spikes, and he assured me,\r\nwere peculiarly poisonous to the flesh. Some of the most painful and\r\ntedious wounds he had ever seen, he said, were incurred by the negroes\r\nrunning these large green thorns into their feet.\r\n\r\nThis led him to speak of the glory and beauty of the orange trees on the\r\nisland, before a certain uncommonly severe winter, a few years ago,\r\ndestroyed them all. For five miles round the banks grew a double row of\r\nnoble orange trees, as large as our orchard apple trees, covered with\r\ngolden fruit, and silver flowers. It must have been a most magnificent\r\nspectacle, and Captain F----, too, told me, in speaking of it, that he had\r\nbrought Basil Hall here in the season of the trees blossoming, and he had\r\nsaid it was as well worth crossing the Atlantic to see that, as to see the\r\nNiagara. Of all these noble trees nothing now remains but the roots, which\r\nbear witness to their size, and some young sprouts shooting up, affording\r\nsome hope that, in the course of years, the island may wear its bridal\r\ngarland again. One huge stump close to the door is all that remains of an\r\nenormous tree that overtopped the house, from the upper windows of which\r\noranges have been gathered from off its branches, and which, one year,\r\nbore the incredible number of 8,542 oranges. Mr. K---- assured me of this\r\nas a positive fact, of which he had at the time made the entry in his\r\njournal, considering such a crop from a single tree well worthy of record.\r\nMr. ---- was called out this evening to listen to a complaint of over\r\nwork, from a gang of pregnant women. I did not stay to listen to the\r\ndetails of their petition, for I am unable to command myself on such\r\noccasions, and Mr. ---- seemed positively degraded in my eyes, as he stood\r\nenforcing upon these women the necessity of their fulfilling their\r\nappointed tasks. How honorable he would have appeared to me begrimed with\r\nthe sweat and soil of the coarsest manual labour, to what he then seemed,\r\nsetting forth to these wretched, ignorant women, as a duty, their unpaid\r\nexacted labour! I turned away in bitter disgust. I hope this sojourn among\r\nMr. ----'s slaves may not lessen my respect for him, but I fear it; for\r\nthe details of slave holding are so unmanly, letting alone every other\r\nconsideration, that I know not how anyone, with the spirit of a man, can\r\ncondescend to them.\r\n\r\nI have been out again on the river, rowing. I find nothing new. Swamps\r\ncrowned with perfect evergreens are the only land (that's Irish!) about\r\nhere, and, of course, turn which way I will, the natural features of river\r\nand shore are the same. I do not weary of these most exquisite watery\r\nwoods, but you will of my mention of them, I fear. Adieu.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. Since I last wrote to you I have been actually engaged in\r\nreceiving and returning visits; for even to this _ultima thule_ of all\r\ncivilisation do these polite usages extend. I have been called upon by\r\nseveral families residing in and about Darien, and rowed over in due form\r\nto acknowledge the honour. How shall I describe Darien to you? The\r\nabomination of desolation is but a poor type of its forlorn appearance,\r\nas, half buried in sand, its straggling, tumble-down wooden houses peer\r\nover the muddy bank of the thick slimy river. The whole town lies in a bed\r\nof sand--side walks, or mid walks, there be none distinct from each other;\r\nat every step I took my feet were ankle deep in the soil, and I had cause\r\nto rejoice that I was booted for the occasion. Our worthy doctor, whose\r\nlady I was going to visit, did nothing but regret that I had not allowed\r\nhim to provide me a carriage, though the distance between his house and\r\nthe landing is not a quarter of a mile. The magnitude of the exertion\r\nseemed to fill him with amazement, and he over and over again repeated how\r\nimpossible it would be to prevail on any of the ladies there to take such\r\na walk. The houses seemed scattered about here and there, apparently\r\nwithout any design, and looked, for the most part, either unfinished or\r\nruinous. One feature of the scene alone recalled the villages of New\r\nEngland--the magnificent oaks, which seemed to add to the meanness and\r\ninsignificance of the human dwellings they overshadowed by their enormous\r\nsize and grotesque forms. They reminded me of the elms of Newhaven and\r\nStockbridge. They are quite as large, and more picturesque, from their\r\nsombre foliage and the infinite variety of their forms--a beauty wanting\r\nin the New England elm, which invariably rises and spreads in a way which,\r\nthough the most graceful in the world, at length palls on the capricious\r\nhuman eye, which seeks, above all other beauties, variety. Our doctor's\r\nwife is a New England woman; how can she live here? She had the fair eyes\r\nand hair and fresh complexion of your part of the country, and its dearly\r\nbeloved snuffle, which seemed actually dearly beloved when I heard it down\r\nhere. She gave me some violets and narcissus, already blossoming\r\nprofusely--in January--and expressed, like her husband, a thousand regrets\r\nat my having walked so far.\r\n\r\nA transaction of the most amusing nature occurred to-day with regard to\r\nthe resources of the Darien Bank, and the mode of carrying on business in\r\nthat liberal and enlightened institution, the funds of which I should\r\nthink quite incalculable--impalpable, certainly, they appeared by our\r\nexperience this morning.\r\n\r\nThe river, as we came home, was covered with Ocone boxes. It is well for\r\nthem they are so shallow-bottomed, for we rasped sand all the way home\r\nthrough the cut, and in the shallows of the river.\r\n\r\nI have been over the rice-mill, under the guidance of the overseer and\r\nhead-man Frank, and have been made acquainted with the whole process of\r\nthreshing the rice, which is extremely curious; and here I may again\r\nmention another statement of Miss Martineau's, which I am told is, and I\r\nshould suppose from what I see here must be, a mistake. She states that\r\nthe chaff of the husks of the rice is used as a manure for the fields;\r\nwhereas the people have to-day assured me that it is of so hard, stony,\r\nand untractable a nature, as to be literally good for nothing. Here I know\r\nit is thrown away by cart-loads into the river, where its only use appears\r\nto be to act like ground bait, and attract a vast quantity of small fish\r\nto its vicinity. The number of hands employed in this threshing-mill is\r\nvery considerable, and the whole establishment, comprising the fires and\r\nboilers and machinery of a powerful steam engine, are all under negro\r\nsuperintendence and direction. After this survey, I occupied myself with\r\nmy infant plantation of evergreens round the dyke, in the midst of which\r\ninteresting pursuit I was interrupted by a visit from Mr. B----, a\r\nneighbouring planter, who came to transact some business with Mr. ----\r\nabout rice which he had sent to our mill to have threshed, and the price\r\nto be paid for such threshing. The negroes have presented a petition\r\nto-day that they may be allowed to have a ball in honour of our arrival,\r\nwhich demand has been acceded to, and furious preparations are being set\r\non foot.\r\n\r\nOn visiting the Infirmary to-day, I was extremely pleased with the\r\nincreased cleanliness and order observable in all the rooms. Two little\r\nfilthy children, however, seemed to be still under the _ancien régime_ of\r\nnon-ablution; but upon my saying to the old nurse Molly, in whose ward\r\nthey were, 'Why, Molly, I don't believe you have bathed those children\r\nto-day,' she answered, with infinite dignity, 'Missis no b'lieve me wash\r\num piccaninny! and yet she tress me wid all um niggar when 'em sick.' The\r\ninjured innocence and lofty conscious integrity of this speech silenced\r\nand abashed me; and yet I can't help it, but I don't believe to this\r\npresent hour that those children had had any experience of water, at least\r\nnot washing water, since they first came into the world.\r\n\r\nI rowed over to Darien again, to make some purchases, yesterday; and\r\nenquiring the price of various articles, could not but wonder to find\r\nthem at least three times as dear as in your northern villages. The\r\nprofits of these southern shopkeepers (who, for the most part, are\r\nthoroughbred Yankees, with the true Yankee propensity to trade, no matter\r\non how dirty a counter, or in what manner of wares) are enormous. The\r\nprices they ask for everything, from coloured calicoes for negro dresses\r\nto pianofortes (one of which, for curiosity sake, I enquired the value\r\nof), are fabulous, and such as none but the laziest and most reckless\r\npeople in the world would consent to afford. On our return we found the\r\nwater in the cut so extremely low that we were obliged to push the boat\r\nthrough it, and did not accomplish it without difficulty. The banks of\r\nthis canal, when they are thus laid bare, present a singular appearance\r\nenough,--two walls of solid mud, through which matted, twisted, twined,\r\nand tangled, like the natural veins of wood, runs an everlasting net of\r\nindestructible roots, the thousand toes of huge cypress feet. The trees\r\nhave been cut down long ago from the soil, but these fangs remain in the\r\nearth without decaying for an incredible space of time. This long\r\nendurance of immersion is one of the valuable properties of these cypress\r\nroots; but though excellent binding stuff for the sides of a canal, they\r\nmust be pernicious growth in any land used for cultivation that requires\r\ndeep tillage. On entering the Altamaha, we found the tide so low that we\r\nwere much obstructed by the sand banks, which, but for their constant\r\nshifting, would presently take entire possession of this noble stream,\r\nand render it utterly impassable from shore to shore, as it already is in\r\nseveral parts of the channel at certain seasons of the tide. On landing,\r\nI was seized hold of by a hideous old negress, named Sinda, who had come\r\nto pay me a visit, and of whom Mr. ---- told me a strange anecdote. She\r\npassed at one time for a prophetess among her fellow slaves on the\r\nplantation, and had acquired such an ascendancy over them that, having\r\ngiven out, after the fashion of Mr. Miller, that the world was to come to\r\nan end at a certain time, and that not a very remote one, the belief in\r\nher assertion took such possession of the people on the estate, that they\r\nrefused to work; and the rice and cotton fields were threatened with an\r\nindefinite fallow, in consequence of this strike on the part of the\r\ncultivators. Mr. K----, who was then overseer of the property, perceived\r\nthe impossibility of arguing, remonstrating, or even flogging this solemn\r\npanic out of the minds of the slaves. The great final emancipation which\r\nthey believed at hand had stripped even the lash of its prevailing\r\nauthority, and the terrors of an overseer for once were as nothing, in\r\nthe terrible expectation of the advent of the universal Judge of men.\r\nThey were utterly impracticable--so, like a very shrewd man as he was, he\r\nacquiesced in their determination not to work; but he expressed to them\r\nhis belief that Sinda was mistaken, and he warned her that if, at the\r\nappointed time, it proved so, she would be severely punished. I do not\r\nknow whether he confided to the slaves what he thought likely to be the\r\nresult if she was in the right; but poor Sinda was in the wrong. Her day\r\nof judgement came indeed, and a severe one it proved, for Mr. K---- had\r\nher tremendously flogged, and her end of things ended much like Mr.\r\nMiller's; but whereas he escaped unhanged, in spite of his atrocious\r\npractices upon the fanaticism and credulity of his country people, the\r\nspirit of false prophecy was mercilessly scourged out of her, and the\r\nfaith of her people of course reverted from her to the omnipotent lash\r\nagain. Think what a dream that must have been while it lasted, for those\r\ninfinitely oppressed people,--freedom without entering it by the grim\r\ngate of death, brought down to them at once by the second coming of\r\nChrist, whose first advent has left them yet so far from it! Farewell; it\r\nmakes me giddy to think of having been a slave while that delusion\r\nlasted, and after it vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I received early this morning a visit from a young negro,\r\ncalled Morris, who came to request permission to be baptised. The master's\r\nleave is necessary for this ceremony of acceptance into the bosom of the\r\nChristian Church; so all that can be said is, that it is to be hoped the\r\nrite itself may _not_ be indispensable for salvation, as if Mr. ---- had\r\nthought proper to refuse Morris' petition, he must infallibly have been\r\nlost, in spite of his own best wishes to the contrary. I could not, in\r\ndiscoursing with him, perceive that he had any very distinct ideas of the\r\nadvantages he expected to derive from the ceremony; but perhaps they\r\nappeared all the greater for being a little vague. I have seldom seen a\r\nmore pleasing appearance than that of this young man; his figure was tall\r\nand straight, and his face, which was of a perfect oval, rejoiced in the\r\ngrace, very unusual among his people, of a fine high forehead, and the\r\nmuch more frequent one of a remarkably gentle and sweet expression. He\r\nwas, however, jet black, and certainly did not owe these personal\r\nadvantages to any mixture in his blood. There is a certain African tribe\r\nfrom which the West Indian slave market is chiefly recruited, who have\r\nthese same characteristic features, and do not at all present the ignoble\r\nand ugly negro type, so much more commonly seen here. They are a tall,\r\npowerful people, with remarkably fine figures, regular features, and a\r\nsingularly warlike and fierce disposition, in which respect they also\r\ndiffer from the race of negroes existing on the American plantations. I do\r\nnot think Morris, however, could have belonged to this tribe, though\r\nperhaps Othello did, which would at once settle the difficulties of those\r\ncommentators who, abiding by Iago's very disagreeable suggestions as to\r\nhis purely African appearance, are painfully compelled to forego the\r\nmitigation of supposing him a Moor and not a negro. Did I ever tell you of\r\nmy dining in Boston, at the H----'s, on my first visit to that city, and\r\nsitting by Mr. John Quincy Adams, who, talking to me about Desdemona,\r\nassured me, with a most serious expression of sincere disgust, that he\r\nconsidered all her misfortunes as a very just judgement upon her for\r\nhaving married a 'nigger?' I think if some ingenious American actor of\r\nthe present day, bent upon realising Shakespeare's finest conceptions,\r\nwith all the advantages of modern enlightenment, could contrive to slip in\r\nthat opprobrious title, with a true South-Carolinian anti-Abolitionist\r\nexpression, it might really be made quite a point for Iago, as, for\r\ninstance, in his first soliloquy--'I hate the nigger,' given in proper\r\nCharleston or Savannah fashion, I am sure would tell far better than 'I\r\nhate the Moor.' Only think, E----, what a very new order of interest the\r\nwhole tragedy might receive, acted throughout from this standpoint, as the\r\nGermans call it in this country, and called 'Amalgamation, or the Black\r\nBridal.'\r\n\r\nOn their return from their walk this afternoon, the children brought home\r\nsome pieces of sugar-cane, of which a small quantity grows on the island.\r\nWhen I am most inclined to deplore the condition of the poor slaves on\r\nthese cotton and rice plantations, the far more intolerable existence and\r\nharder labour of those employed on the sugar estates occurs to me,\r\nsometimes producing the effect of a lower circle in Dante's 'Hell of\r\nHorrors,' opening beneath the one where he seems to have reached the\r\nclimax of infernal punishment. You may have seen this vegetable, and must,\r\nat any rate, I should think, be familiar with it by description. It is a\r\nlong green reed, like the stalk of the maize, or Indian corn, only it\r\nshoots up to a much more considerable height, and has a consistent pith,\r\nwhich, together with the rind itself, is extremely sweet. The principal\r\npeculiarity of this growth, as perhaps you know, is that they are laid\r\nhorizontally in the earth when they are planted for propagation, and from\r\neach of the notches or joints of the recumbent cane a young shoot is\r\nproduced at the germinating season.\r\n\r\nA very curious and interesting circumstance to me just now in the\r\nneighbourhood is the projection of a canal, to be called the Brunswick\r\nCanal, which, by cutting through the lower part of the mainland, towards\r\nthe southern extremity of Great St. Simon's Island, is contemplated as a\r\nprobable and powerful means of improving the prosperity of the town of\r\nBrunswick, by bringing it into immediate communication with the Atlantic.\r\nThe scheme, which I think I have mentioned to you before, is, I believe,\r\nchiefly patronised by your States' folk--Yankee enterprise and funds being\r\nvery essential elements, it appears to me, in all southern projects and\r\nachievements. This speculation, however, from all I hear of the\r\ndifficulties of the undertaking, from the nature of the soil, and the\r\nimpossibility almost of obtaining efficient labour, is not very likely to\r\narrive at any very satisfactory result; and, indeed, I find it hard to\r\nconceive how this part of Georgia can possibly produce a town which can be\r\nworth the digging of a canal, even to Yankee speculators. There is one\r\nfeature of the undertaking, however, which more than all the others\r\nexcites my admiration, namely, that Irish labourers have been advertised\r\nfor to work upon the canal, and the terms offered them are twenty dollars\r\na month per man and their board. Now these men will have for fellow\r\nlabourers negroes who not only will receive nothing at all for their work,\r\nbut who will be hired by the contractors and directors of the works from\r\ntheir masters, to whom they will hand over the price of their slaves'\r\nlabour; while it will be the interest of the person hiring them not only\r\nto get as much work as possible out of them, but also to provide them as\r\neconomically with food, combining the two praiseworthy endeavours exactly\r\nin such judicious proportions as not to let them neutralize each other.\r\nYou will observe that this case of a master hiring out his slaves to\r\nanother employer, from whom he receives their rightful wages, is a form of\r\nslavery which, though extremely common, is very seldom adverted to in\r\nthose arguments for the system which are chiefly founded upon the master's\r\npresumed regard for his human property. People who have ever let a\r\nfavourite house to the temporary occupation of strangers, can form a\r\ntolerable idea of the difference between one's own regard and care of\r\none's goods and chattels and that of the most conscientious tenant; and\r\nwhereas I have not yet observed that ownership is a very effectual\r\nprotection to the slaves against ill usage and neglect, I am quite\r\nprepared to admit that it is a vastly better one than the temporary\r\ninterest which a lessee can feel in the live stock he hires, out of whom\r\nit is his manifest interest to get as much, and into whom to put as\r\nlittle, as possible. Yet thousands of slaves throughout the southern\r\nstates are thus handed over by the masters who own them to masters who do\r\nnot; and it does not require much demonstration to prove that their estate\r\nis not always the more gracious. Now you must not suppose that these same\r\nIrish free labourers and negro slaves will be permitted to work together\r\nat this Brunswick Canal. They say that this would be utterly impossible;\r\nfor why?--there would be tumults, and risings, and broken heads, and\r\nbloody bones, and all the natural results of Irish intercommunion with\r\ntheir fellow creatures, no doubt--perhaps even a little more riot and\r\nviolence than merely comports with their usual habits of Milesian good\r\nfellowship; for, say the masters, the Irish hate the negroes more even\r\nthan the Americans do, and there would be no bound to their murderous\r\nanimosity if they were brought in contact with them on the same portion of\r\nthe works of the Brunswick Canal. Doubtless there is some truth in\r\nthis--the Irish labourers who might come hither, would be apt enough,\r\naccording to a universal moral law, to visit upon others the injuries they\r\nhad received from others. They have been oppressed enough themselves, to\r\nbe oppressive whenever they have a chance; and the despised and degraded\r\ncondition of the blacks, presenting to them a very ugly resemblance of\r\ntheir own home, circumstances naturally excite in them the exercise of the\r\ndisgust and contempt of which they themselves are very habitually the\r\nobjects; and that such circular distribution of wrongs may not only be\r\npleasant, but have something like the air of retributive right to very\r\nignorant folks, is not much to be wondered at. Certain is the fact,\r\nhowever, that the worst of all tyrants is the one who has been a slave;\r\nand for that matter (and I wonder if the southern slaveholders hear it\r\nwith the same ear that I do, and ponder it with the same mind?) the\r\ncommand of one slave to another is altogether the most uncompromising\r\nutterance of insolent truculent despotism that it ever fell to my lot to\r\nwitness or listen to. 'You nigger--I say, you black nigger,--you no hear\r\nme call you--what for you no run quick?' All this, dear E----, is\r\ncertainly reasonably in favour of division of labour on the Brunswick\r\nCanal; but the Irish are not only quarrelers, and rioters, and fighters,\r\nand drinkers, and despisers of niggers--they are a passionate, impulsive,\r\nwarm-hearted, generous people, much given to powerful indignations, which\r\nbreak out suddenly when they are not compelled to smoulder\r\nsullenly--pestilent sympathisers too, and with a sufficient dose of\r\nAmerican atmospheric air in their lungs, properly mixed with a right\r\nproportion of ardent spirits, there is no saying but what they might\r\nactually take to sympathy with the slaves, and I leave you to judge of\r\nthe possible consequences. You perceive, I am sure, that they can by no\r\nmeans be allowed to work together on the Brunswick Canal.\r\n\r\nI have been taking my daily walk round the island, and visited the sugar\r\nmill and the threshing mill again.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- has received another letter from Parson S---- upon the subject of\r\nmore church building in Darien. It seems that there has been a very\r\ngeneral panic in this part of the slave states lately, occasioned by some\r\ninjudicious missionary preaching, which was pronounced to be of a\r\ndecidedly abolitionist tendency. The offensive preachers, after sowing,\r\nGod only knows what seed in this tremendous soil, where one grain of\r\nknowledge may spring up a gigantic upas tree to the prosperity of its most\r\nunfortunate possessors, were summarily and ignominiously expulsed; and now\r\nsome short sighted, uncomfortable Christians in these parts, among others\r\nthis said Parson S----, are possessed with the notion that something had\r\nbetter be done to supply the want created by the cessation of these\r\ndangerous exhortations, to which the negroes have listened, it seems, with\r\ncomplacency. Parson S---- seems to think that, having driven out two\r\npreachers, it might be well to build one church where, at any rate, the\r\nnegroes might be exhorted in a safe and salutary manner, 'qui ne leur\r\ndonnerait point d'idées,' as the French would say. Upon my word, E----, I\r\nused to pity the slaves, and I do pity them with all my soul; but oh\r\ndear! oh dear! their case is a bed of roses to that of their owners, and I\r\nwould go to the slave block in Charleston to-morrow cheerfully to be\r\npurchased, if my only option was to go thither as a purchaser. I was\r\nlooking over this morning, with a most indescribable mixture of feelings,\r\na pamphlet published in the south upon the subject of the religious\r\ninstruction of the slaves; and the difficulty of the task undertaken by\r\nthese reconcilers of God and Mammon really seems to me nothing short of\r\npiteous. 'We must give our involuntary servants,' (they seldom call them\r\nslaves, for it is an ugly word in an American mouth, you know,) 'Christian\r\nenlightenment,' say they; and where shall they begin? 'Whatsoever ye would\r\nthat men should do unto you, do ye also unto them?' No--but, 'Servants,\r\nobey your masters;' and there, I think, they naturally come to a full\r\nstop. This pamphlet forcibly suggested to me the necessity for a slave\r\nchurch catechism, and also, indeed, if it were possible, a slave Bible. If\r\nthese heaven-blinded negro enlighteners persist in their pernicious plan\r\nof making Christians of their cattle, something of the sort must be done,\r\nor they will infallibly cut their own throats with this two-edged sword of\r\ntruth, to which they should in no wise have laid their hand, and would\r\nnot, doubtless, but that it is now thrust at them so threateningly that\r\nthey have no choice. Again and again, how much I do pity them!\r\n\r\nI have been walking to another cluster of negro huts, known as Number\r\nTwo, and here we took a boat and rowed across the broad brimming Altamaha\r\nto a place called Woodville, on a part of the estate named Hammersmith,\r\nthough why that very thriving suburb of the great city of London should\r\nhave been selected as the name of the lonely plank house in the midst of\r\nthe pine woods which here enjoys that title I cannot conceive, unless it\r\nwas suggested by the contrast. This settlement is on the mainland, and\r\nconsists apparently merely of this house, (to which the overseer retires\r\nwhen the poisonous malaria of the rice plantations compels him to withdraw\r\nfrom it,) and a few deplorably miserable hovels, which appeared to me to\r\nbe chiefly occupied by the most decrepid and infirm samples of humanity it\r\nwas ever my melancholy lot to behold.\r\n\r\nThe air of this pine barren is salubrious compared with that of the rice\r\nislands, and here some of the oldest slaves who will not die yet, and\r\ncannot work any more, are sent, to go, as it were, out of the way. Remote\r\nrecollections of former dealings with civilised human beings, in the shape\r\nof masters and overseers, seemed to me to be the only idea not purely\r\nidiotic in the minds of the poor old tottering creatures that gathered to\r\nstare with dim and blear eyes at me and my children.\r\n\r\nThere were two very aged women, who had seen different, and to their faded\r\nrecollections better, times, who spoke to me of Mr. ----'s grandfather,\r\nand of the early days of the plantation, when they were young and strong,\r\nand worked as their children and grandchildren were now working, neither\r\nfor love nor yet for money. One of these old crones, a hideous, withered,\r\nwrinkled piece of womanhood, said that she had worked as long as her\r\nstrength had lasted, and that then she had still been worth her keep, for,\r\nsaid she, 'Missus, tho' we no able to work, we make little niggers for\r\nmassa.' Her joy at seeing her present owner was unbounded, and she kept\r\nclapping her horny hands together and exclaiming, 'while there is life\r\nthere is hope; we seen massa before we die.' These demonstrations of\r\nregard were followed up by piteous complaints of hunger and rheumatism,\r\nand their usual requests for pittances of food and clothing, to which we\r\nresponded by promises of additions in both kinds; and I was extricating\r\nmyself as well as I could from my petitioners, with the assurance that I\r\nwould come by-and-bye and visit them again, when I felt my dress suddenly\r\nfeebly jerked, and a shrill cracked voice on the other side of me\r\nexclaimed, 'Missus, no go yet--no go away yet; you no see me, missus, when\r\nyou come by-and-bye; but,' added the voice in a sort of wail, which seemed\r\nto me as if the thought was full of misery, 'you see many, many of my\r\noffspring.' These melancholy words, particularly the rather unusual one at\r\nthe end of the address, struck me very much. They were uttered by a\r\ncreature which _was_ a woman, but looked like a crooked ill-built figure\r\nset up in a field to scare crows, with a face infinitely more like a mere\r\nanimal's than any human countenance I ever beheld, and with that peculiar\r\nwild restless look of indefinite and, at the same time, intense sadness\r\nthat is so remarkable in the countenance of some monkeys. It was almost\r\nwith an effort that I commanded myself so as not to withdraw my dress from\r\nthe yellow crumpled filthy claws that griped it, and it was not at last\r\nwithout the authoritative voice of the overseer that the poor creature\r\nreleased her hold of me.\r\n\r\nWe returned home certainly in the very strangest vehicle that ever\r\ncivilised gentlewoman travelled in--a huge sort of cart, made only of some\r\nloose boards, on which I lay supporting myself against one of the four\r\nposts which indicated the sides of my carriage; six horned creatures, cows\r\nor bulls, drew this singular equipage, and a yelping, howling, screaming,\r\nleaping company of half-naked negroes ran all round them, goading them\r\nwith sharp sticks, frantically seizing hold of their tails, and inciting\r\nthem by every conceivable and inconceivable encouragement to quick motion:\r\nthus, like one of the ancient Merovingian monarchs, I was dragged through\r\nthe deep sand from the settlement back to the river, where we reembarked\r\nfor the island.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the broad flood, whose turbid waters always look swollen as\r\nif by a series of freshets, a flight of birds sprang from the low swamp we\r\nwere approaching, and literally, as it rose in the air, cast a shadow\r\nlike that of a cloud, which might be said, with but little exaggeration,\r\nto darken the sun for a few seconds. How well I remember my poor aunt\r\nWhitelock describing such phenomena as of frequent occurrence in America,\r\nand the scornful incredulity with which we heard without accepting these\r\nlegends of her Western experience! how little I then thought that I should\r\nhave to cry peccavi to her memory from the bottom of such ruts, and under\r\nthe shadow of such flights of winged creatures as she used to describe\r\nfrom the muddy ways of Pennsylvania and the muddy waters of Georgia!\r\n\r\nThe vegetation is already in an active state of demonstration, sprouting\r\ninto lovely pale green and vivid red-brown buds and leaflets, though 'tis\r\nyet early in January.\r\n\r\nAfter our return home we had a visit from Mr. C----, one of our\r\nneighbours, an intelligent and humane man, to whose account of the\r\nqualities and characteristics of the slaves, as he had observed and\r\nexperienced them, I listened with great interest. The Brunswick Canal was\r\nagain the subject of conversation, and again the impossibility of allowing\r\nthe negroes and Irish to work in proximity was stated, and admitted as an\r\nindisputable fact. It strikes me with amazement to hear the hopeless doom\r\nof incapacity for progress pronounced upon these wretched slaves, when in\r\nmy own country the very same order of language is perpetually applied to\r\nthese very Irish, here spoken of as a sort of race of demigods, by negro\r\ncomparison. And it is most true that in Ireland nothing can be more\r\nsavage, brutish, filthy, idle, and incorrigibly and hopelessly helpless\r\nand incapable, than the Irish appear; and yet, transplanted to your\r\nnorthern states, freed from the evil influences which surround them at\r\nhome, they and their children become industrious, thrifty, willing to\r\nlearn, able to improve, and forming, in the course of two generations, a\r\nmost valuable accession to your labouring population. How is it that it\r\nnever occurs to these emphatical denouncers of the whole negro race that\r\nthe Irish at home are esteemed much as they esteem their slaves, and that\r\nthe sentence pronounced against their whole country by one of the greatest\r\nmen of our age, an Irishman, was precisely, that nothing could save,\r\nredeem, or regenerate Ireland unless, as a preparatory measure, the island\r\nwere submerged and all its inhabitants drowned off?\r\n\r\nI have had several women at the house to-day asking for advice and help\r\nfor their sick children: they all came from No. 2, as they call it, that\r\nis, the settlement or cluster of negro huts nearest to the main one, where\r\nwe may be said to reside. In the afternoon I went thither, and found a\r\ngreat many of the little children ailing; there had been an unusual\r\nmortality among them at this particular settlement this winter. In one\r\nmiserable hut I heard that the baby was just dead; it was one of thirteen,\r\nmany of whom had been, like itself, mercifully removed from the life of\r\ndegradation and misery to which their birth appointed them: and whether\r\nit was the frequent repetition of similar losses, or an instinctive\r\nconsciousness that death was indeed better than life for such children as\r\ntheirs, I know not, but the father and mother, and old Rose, the nurse,\r\nwho was their little baby's grandmother, all seemed apathetic, and\r\napparently indifferent to the event. The mother merely repeated over and\r\nover again, 'I've lost a many, they all goes so;' and the father, without\r\nword or comment, went out to his enforced labour.\r\n\r\nAs I left the cabin, rejoicing for them at the deliverance out of slavery\r\nof their poor child, I found myself suddenly surrounded by a swarm of\r\nyoung ragamuffins in every stage of partial nudity, clamouring from out of\r\ntheir filthy remnants of rags for donations of scarlet ribbon for the\r\nball, which was to take place that evening. The melancholy scene I had\r\njust witnessed, and the still sadder reflection it had given rise to, had\r\nquite driven all thoughts of the approaching festivity from my mind; but\r\nthe sudden demand for these graceful luxuries by Mr. ----'s half-naked\r\ndependants reminded me of the grotesque mask which life wears on one of\r\nits mysterious faces; and with as much sympathy for rejoicing as my late\r\nsympathy for sorrow had left me capable of, I procured the desired\r\nornaments. I have considerable fellow-feeling for the passion for all\r\nshades of red, which prevails among these dusky fellow-creatures of\r\nmine--a savage propensity for that same colour in all its modifications\r\nbeing a tendency of my own.\r\n\r\nAt our own settlement (No. 1) I found everything in a high fever of\r\npreparation for the ball. A huge boat had just arrived from the cotton\r\nplantation at St. Simons, laden with the youth and beauty of that portion\r\nof the estate who had been invited to join the party; and the greetings\r\namong the arrivers and welcomers, and the heaven-defying combinations of\r\ncolour in the gala attire of both, surpass all my powers of description.\r\nThe ball, to which of course we went, took place in one of the rooms of\r\nthe Infirmary. As the room had, fortunately, but few occupants, they were\r\nremoved to another apartment, and, without any very tender consideration\r\nfor their not very remote, though invisible, sufferings, the dancing\r\ncommenced, and was continued. Oh, my dear E----! I have seen Jim Crow--the\r\nveritable James: all the contortions, and springs, and flings, and kicks,\r\nand capers you have been beguiled into accepting as indicative of him are\r\nspurious, faint, feeble, impotent--in a word, pale northern reproductions\r\nof that ineffable black conception. It is impossible for words to describe\r\nthe things these people did with their bodies, and, above all, with their\r\nfaces, the whites of their eyes, and the whites of their teeth, and\r\ncertain outlines which either naturally and by the grace of heaven, or by\r\nthe practice of some peculiar artistic dexterity, they bring into\r\nprominent and most ludicrous display. The languishing elegance of some,\r\nthe painstaking laboriousness of others, above all, the feats of a certain\r\nenthusiastic banjo-player, who seemed to me to thump his instrument with\r\nevery part of his body at once, at last so utterly overcame any attempt at\r\ndecorous gravity on my part that I was obliged to secede; and, considering\r\nwhat the atmosphere was that we inhaled during the exhibition, it is only\r\nwonderful to me that we were not made ill by the double effort not to\r\nlaugh, and, if possible, not to breathe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, 20th.\r\n\r\nMy Dearest E----. A rather longer interval than usual has elapsed since I\r\nlast wrote to you, but I must beg you to excuse it. I have had more than a\r\nusual amount of small daily occupations to fill my time; and, as a mere\r\nenumeration of these would not be very interesting to you, I will tell you\r\na story which has just formed an admirable illustration for my observation\r\nof all the miseries of which this accursed system of slavery is the cause,\r\neven under the best and most humane administration of its laws and usages.\r\nPray note it, my dear friend, for you will find, in the absence of all\r\nvoluntary or even conscious cruelty on the part of the master, the best\r\npossible comment on a state of things which, without the slightest desire\r\nto injure and oppress, produces such intolerable results of injury and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nWe have, as a sort of under nursemaid and assistant of my dear M----,\r\nwhose white complexion, as I wrote you, occasioned such indignation to my\r\nsouthern fellow-travellers, and such extreme perplexity to the poor slaves\r\non our arrival here, a much more orthodox servant for these parts, a young\r\nwoman named Psyche, but commonly called Sack, not a very graceful\r\nabbreviation of the divine heathen appellation: she cannot be much over\r\ntwenty, has a very pretty figure, a graceful gentle deportment, and a face\r\nwhich, but for its colour (she is a dingy mulatto), would be pretty, and\r\nis extremely pleasing, from the perfect sweetness of its expression; she\r\nis always serious, not to say sad and silent, and has altogether an air of\r\nmelancholy and timidity, that has frequently struck me very much, and\r\nwould have made me think some special anxiety or sorrow must occasion it,\r\nbut that God knows the whole condition of these wretched people naturally\r\nproduces such a deportment, and there is no necessity to seek for special\r\nor peculiar causes to account for it. Just in proportion as I have found\r\nthe slaves on this plantation intelligent and advanced beyond the general\r\nbrutish level of the majority, I have observed this pathetic expression of\r\ncountenance in them, a mixture of sadness and fear, the involuntary\r\nexhibition of the two feelings, which I suppose must be the predominant\r\nexperience of their whole lives, regret and apprehension, not the less\r\nheavy, either of them, for being, in some degree, vague and indefinite--a\r\nsense of incalculable past loss and injury, and a dread of incalculable\r\nfuture loss and injury.\r\n\r\nI have never questioned Psyche as to her sadness, because, in the first\r\nplace, as I tell you, it appears to me most natural, and is observable in\r\nall the slaves, whose superior natural or acquired intelligence allows of\r\ntheir filling situations of trust or service about the house and family;\r\nand, though I cannot and will not refuse to hear any and every tale of\r\nsuffering which these unfortunates bring to me, I am anxious to spare both\r\nmyself and them the pain of vain appeals to me for redress and help,\r\nwhich, alas! it is too often utterly out of my power to give them. It is\r\nuseless, and indeed worse than useless, that they should see my impotent\r\nindignation and unavailing pity, and hear expressions of compassion for\r\nthem, and horror at their condition, which might only prove incentives to\r\na hopeless resistance on their part to a system, under the hideous weight\r\nof whose oppression any individual or partial revolt must be annihilated\r\nand ground into the dust. Therefore, as I tell you, I asked Psyche no\r\nquestions, but, to my great astonishment, the other day M---- asked me if\r\nI knew to whom Psyche belonged, as the poor woman had enquired of her with\r\nmuch hesitation and anguish if she could tell her who owned her and her\r\nchildren. She has two nice little children under six years old, whom she\r\nkeeps as clean and tidy, and who are sad and as silent, as herself. My\r\nastonishment at this question was, as you will readily believe, not small,\r\nand I forthwith sought out Psyche for an explanation. She was thrown into\r\nextreme perturbation at finding that her question had been referred to me,\r\nand it was some time before I could sufficiently reassure her to be able\r\nto comprehend, in the midst of her reiterated entreaties for pardon, and\r\nhopes that she had not offended me, that she did not know herself who\r\nowned her. She was, at one time, the property of Mr. K----, the former\r\noverseer, of whom I have already spoken to you, and who has just been\r\npaying Mr. ---- a visit. He, like several of his predecessors in the\r\nmanagement, has contrived to make a fortune upon it (though it yearly\r\ndecreases in value to the owners, but this is the inevitable course of\r\nthings in the southern states), and has purchased a plantation of his own\r\nin Alabama, I believe, or one of the south-western states. Whether she\r\nstill belonged to Mr. K---- or not she did not know, and entreated me if\r\nshe did to endeavour to persuade Mr. ---- to buy her. Now, you must know\r\nthat this poor woman is the wife of one of Mr. B----'s slaves, a fine,\r\nintelligent, active, excellent young man, whose whole family are among\r\nsome of the very best specimens of character and capacity on the estate. I\r\nwas so astonished at the (to me) extraordinary state of things revealed by\r\npoor Sack's petition, that I could only tell her that I had supposed all\r\nthe negroes on the plantation were Mr. ----'s property, but that I would\r\ncertainly enquire, and find out for her if I could to whom she belonged,\r\nand if I could, endeavour to get Mr. ---- to purchase her, if she really\r\nwas not his.\r\n\r\nNow, E----, just conceive for one moment the state of mind of this woman,\r\nbelieving herself to belong to a man who, in a few days, was going down\r\nto one of those abhorred and dreaded south-western states, and who would\r\nthen compel her, with her poor little children, to leave her husband and\r\nthe only home she had ever known, and all the ties of affection,\r\nrelationship, and association of her former life, to follow him thither,\r\nin all human probability never again to behold any living creature that\r\nshe had seen before; and this was so completely a matter of course that\r\nit was not even thought necessary to apprise her positively of the fact,\r\nand the only thing that interposed between her and this most miserable\r\nfate was the faint hope that Mr. ---- _might have_ purchased her and her\r\nchildren. But if he had, if this great deliverance had been vouchsafed to\r\nher, the knowledge of it was not thought necessary; and with this deadly\r\ndread at her heart she was living day after day, waiting upon me and\r\nseeing me, with my husband beside me, and my children in my arms in\r\nblessed security, safe from all separation but the one reserved in God's\r\ngreat providence for all His creatures. Do you think I wondered any more\r\nat the woe-begone expression of her countenance, or do you think it was\r\neasy for me to restrain within prudent and proper limits the expression\r\nof my feelings at such a state of things? And she had gone on from day to\r\nday enduring this agony, till I suppose its own intolerable pressure and\r\nM----'s sweet countenance and gentle sympathising voice and manner had\r\nconstrained her to lay down this great burden of sorrow at our feet. I\r\ndid not see Mr. ---- until the evening; but in the meantime, meeting Mr.\r\nO----, the overseer, with whom, as I believe I have already told you, we\r\nare living here, I asked him about Psyche, and who was her proprietor,\r\nwhen to my infinite surprise he told me that _he_ had bought her and her\r\nchildren from Mr. K----, who had offered them to him, saying that they\r\nwould be rather troublesome to him than otherwise down where he was\r\ngoing; 'and so,' said Mr. O----, 'as I had no objection to investing a\r\nlittle money that way, I bought them.' With a heart much lightened I flew\r\nto tell poor Psyche the news, so that at any rate she might be relieved\r\nfrom the dread of any immediate separation from her husband. You can\r\nimagine better than I can tell you what her sensations were; but she\r\nstill renewed her prayer that I would, if possible, induce Mr. ---- to\r\npurchase her, and I promised to do so.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, while I was still dressing, I was suddenly\r\nstartled by hearing voices in loud tones in Mr. ----'s dressing-room,\r\nwhich adjoins my bed-room, and the noise increasing until there was an\r\nabsolute cry of despair uttered by some man. I could restrain myself no\r\nlonger, but opened the door of communication, and saw Joe, the young man,\r\npoor Psyche's husband, raving almost in a state of frenzy, and in a voice\r\nbroken with sobs and almost inarticulate with passion, reiterating his\r\ndetermination never to leave this plantation, never to go to Alabama,\r\nnever to leave his old father and mother, his poor wife and children, and\r\ndashing his hat, which he was wringing like a cloth in his hands, upon the\r\nground, he declared he would kill himself if he was compelled to follow\r\nMr. K----. I glanced from the poor wretch to Mr. ----, who was standing,\r\nleaning against a table with his arms folded, occasionally uttering a few\r\nwords of counsel to his slave to be quiet and not fret, and not make a\r\nfuss about what there was no help for. I retreated immediately from the\r\nhorrid scene, breathless with surprise and dismay, and stood for some time\r\nin my own room, with my heart and temples throbbing to such a degree that\r\nI could hardly support myself. As soon as I recovered myself I again\r\nsought Mr. O----, and enquired of him if he knew the cause of poor Joe's\r\ndistress. He then told me that Mr. ----, who is highly pleased with Mr.\r\nK----'s past administration of his property, wished, on his departure for\r\nhis newly-acquired slave plantation, to give him some token of his\r\nsatisfaction, and _had made him a present_ of the man Joe, who had just\r\nreceived the intelligence that he was to go down to Alabama with his new\r\nowner the next day, leaving father, mother, wife, and children behind. You\r\nwill not wonder that the man required a little judicious soothing under\r\nsuch circumstances, and you will also, I hope, admire the humanity of the\r\nsale of his wife and children by the owner who was going to take him to\r\nAlabama, because _they_ would be incumbrances rather than otherwise down\r\nthere. If Mr. K---- did not do this after he knew that the man was his,\r\nthen Mr. ---- gave him to be carried down to the South after his wife and\r\nchildren were sold to remain in Georgia. I do not know which was the real\r\ntransaction, for I have not had the heart to ask; but you will easily\r\nimagine which of the two cases I prefer believing.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Mr. ---- after this most wretched story became known to me in\r\nall its details, I appealed to him for his own soul's sake not to commit\r\nso great a cruelty. Poor Joe's agony while remonstrating with his master\r\nwas hardly greater than mine while arguing with him upon this bitter\r\npiece of inhumanity--how I cried, and how I adjured, and how all my sense\r\nof justice and of mercy and of pity for the poor wretch, and of\r\nwretchedness at finding myself implicated in such a state of things,\r\nbroke in torrents of words from my lips and tears from my eyes! God knows\r\nsuch a sorrow at seeing anyone I belonged to commit such an act was\r\nindeed a new and terrible experience to me, and it seemed to me that I\r\nwas imploring Mr. ---- to save himself, more than to spare these\r\nwretches. He gave me no answer whatever, and I have since thought that\r\nthe intemperate vehemence of my entreaties and expostulations perhaps\r\ndeserved that he should leave me as he did without one single word of\r\nreply; and miserable enough I remained. Towards evening, as I was sitting\r\nalone, my children having gone to bed, Mr. O---- came into the room. I\r\nhad but one subject in my mind; I had not been able to eat for it. I\r\ncould hardly sit still for the nervous distress which every thought of\r\nthese poor people filled me with. As he sat down looking over some\r\naccounts, I said to him, 'Have you seen Joe this afternoon, Mr. O----?'\r\n(I give you our conversation as it took place.) 'Yes, ma'am; he is a\r\ngreat deal happier than he was this morning.' 'Why, how is that?' asked I\r\neagerly. 'Oh, he is not going to Alabama. Mr. K---- heard that he had\r\nkicked up a fuss about it (being in despair at being torn from one's wife\r\nand children is called _kicking up a fuss_; this is a sample of overseer\r\nappreciation of human feelings), and said that if the fellow wasn't\r\nwilling to go with him, he did not wish to be bothered with any niggers\r\ndown there who were to be troublesome, so he might stay behind.' 'And\r\ndoes Psyche know this?' 'Yes, ma'am, I suppose so.' I drew a long breath;\r\nand whereas my needle had stumbled through the stuff I was sewing for an\r\nhour before, as if my fingers could not guide it, the regularity and\r\nrapidity of its evolutions were now quite edifying. The man was for the\r\npresent safe, and I remained silently pondering his deliverance and the\r\nwhole proceeding, and the conduct of everyone engaged in it, and above\r\nall Mr. ----'s share in the transaction, and I think for the first time\r\nalmost a sense of horrible personal responsibility and implication took\r\nhold of my mind, and I felt the weight of an unimagined guilt upon my\r\nconscience; and yet God knows this feeling of self-condemnation is very\r\ngratuitous on my part, since when I married Mr. ---- I knew nothing of\r\nthese dreadful possessions of his, and even if I had, I should have been\r\nmuch puzzled to have formed any idea of the state of things in which I\r\nnow find myself plunged, together with those whose well-doing is as vital\r\nto me almost as my own.\r\n\r\nWith these agreeable reflections I went to bed. Mr. ---- said not a word\r\nto me upon the subject of these poor people all the next day, and in the\r\nmeantime I became very impatient of this reserve on his part, because I\r\nwas dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her\r\nchildren, and so prevent any future separation between her and her\r\nhusband, as I supposed he would not again attempt to make a present of\r\nJoe, at least to anyone who did not wish to be _bothered_ with his wife\r\nand children. In the evening I was again with Mr. O---- alone in the\r\nstrange bare wooden-walled sort of shanty which is our sitting-room, and\r\nrevolving in my mind the means of rescuing Psyche from her miserable\r\nsuspense, a long chain of all my possessions, in the shape of bracelets,\r\nnecklaces, brooches, ear-rings, &c., wound in glittering procession\r\nthrough my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of\r\neach separate ornament, and the very doubtful probability of the amount\r\nof the whole being equal to the price of this poor creature and her\r\nchildren; and then the great power and privilege I had foregone of\r\nearning money by my own labour occurred to me; and I think, for the first\r\ntime in my life, my past profession assumed an aspect that arrested my\r\nthoughts most seriously. For the last four years of my life that preceded\r\nmy marriage, I literally coined money; and never until this moment, I\r\nthink, did I reflect on the great means of good, to myself and others,\r\nthat I so gladly agreed to give up for ever, for a maintenance by the\r\nunpaid labour of slaves--people toiling not only unpaid, but under the\r\nbitter conditions the bare contemplation of which was then wringing my\r\nheart. You will not wonder that, when in the midst of such cogitations I\r\nsuddenly accosted Mr. O----, it was to this effect. 'Mr. O----, I have a\r\nparticular favour to beg of you. Promise me that you will never sell\r\nPsyche and her children without first letting me know of your intention\r\nto do so, and giving me the option of buying them.' Mr. O---- is a\r\nremarkably deliberate man, and squints, so that, when he has taken a\r\nlittle time in directing his eyes to you, you are still unpleasantly\r\nunaware of any result in which you are concerned; he laid down a book he\r\nwas reading, and directed his head and one of his eyes towards me and\r\nanswered, 'Dear me, ma'am, I am very sorry--I have sold them.' My work\r\nfell down on the ground, and my mouth opened wide, but I could utter no\r\nsound, I was so dismayed and surprised; and he deliberately proceeded: 'I\r\ndidn't know, ma'am, you see, at all, that you entertained any idea of\r\nmaking an investment of that nature; for I'm sure, if I had, I would\r\nwillingly have sold the woman to you; but I sold her and her children\r\nthis morning to Mr. ----.' My dear E----, though ---- had resented my\r\nunmeasured upbraidings, you see they had not been without some good\r\neffect, and though he had, perhaps justly, punished my violent outbreak\r\nof indignation about the miserable scene I witnessed by not telling me of\r\nhis humane purpose, he had bought these poor creatures, and so, I trust,\r\nsecured them from any such misery in future. I jumped up and left Mr.\r\nO---- still speaking, and ran to find Mr. ----, to thank him for what he\r\nhad done, and with that will now bid you good bye. Think, E----, how it\r\nfares with slaves on plantations where there is no crazy Englishwoman to\r\nweep and entreat and implore and upbraid for them, and no master willing\r\nto listen to such appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. There is one privilege which I enjoy here which I think few\r\ncockneyesses have ever had experience of, that of hearing my own\r\nextemporaneous praises chaunted bard-fashion by our negroes, in rhymes as\r\nrude and to measures as simple as ever any illustrious female of the days\r\nof King Brian Boroihme listened to. Rowing yesterday evening through a\r\nbeautiful sunset into a more beautiful moonrise, my two sable boatmen\r\nentertained themselves and me with alternate strophe and anti-strophe of\r\npoetical description of my personal attractions, in which my 'wire waist'\r\nrecurred repeatedly, to my intense amusement. This is a charm for the\r\npossession of which M---- (my white nursemaid) is also invariably\r\ncelebrated; and I suppose that the fine round natural proportions of the\r\nuncompressed waists of the sable beauties of these regions appear less\r\nsymmetrical to eyes accustomed to them than our stay-cased figures, since\r\n'nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.' Occasionally I am celebrated in\r\nthese rowing chants as 'Massa's darling,' and S---- comes in for endless\r\nglorification on account of the brilliant beauty of her complexion; the\r\nother day, however, our poets made a diversion from the personal to the\r\nmoral qualities of their small mistress, and after the usual tribute to\r\nher roses and lilies came the following rather significant couplet:--\r\n\r\n    Little Missis Sally,\r\n    That's a ruling lady.\r\n\r\nAt which all the white teeth simultaneously lightened from the black\r\nvisages, while the subject of this equivocal commendation sat with\r\ninfantine solemnity (the profoundest, I think, that the human countenance\r\nis capable of), surveying her sable dependants with imperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I amused myself with an exercise of a talent I once\r\npossessed, but have so neglected that my performance might almost be\r\ncalled an experiment. I cut out a dress for one of the women. My education\r\nin France--where, in some important respects, I think girls are better\r\ntrained than with us--had sent me home to England, at sixteen, an adept in\r\nthe female mystery of needlework. Not only owing to the Saturday's\r\ndiscipline of clothes mending by all the classes--while l'Abbé Millot's\r\nhistory (of blessed, boring memory) was being read aloud, to prevent 'vain\r\nbabblings,' and ensure wholesome mental occupation the while--was I an\r\nexpert patcher and mender, darner and piecer (darning and marking were my\r\nspecialities), but the white cotton embroidery of which every French woman\r\nhas always a piece under her hand _pour les momens perdus_, which are thus\r\nanything but _perdus_, was as familiar to us as to the Irish cottagers of\r\nthe present day, and cutting out and making my dresses was among the more\r\nadvanced branches of _the_ female accomplishment to which I attained.[1]\r\nThe luxury of a lady's maid of my own, indulged in ever since the days of\r\nmy 'coming out,' has naturally enough caused my right hand to forget its\r\ncunning, and regret and shame at having lost any useful lore in my life\r\nmade me accede, for my own sake, to the request of one of our\r\nmultitudinous Dianas and innumerable Chloes to cut out dresses for each of\r\nthem, especially as they (wonderful to relate) declared themselves able to\r\nstitch them if I would do the cutting. Since I have been on the plantation\r\nI have already spent considerable time in what the French call\r\n'confectioning' baby bundles, i.e. the rough and very simple tiny\r\nhabiliments of coarse cotton and scarlet flannel which form a baby's\r\nlayette here, and of which I have run up some scores; but my present task\r\nwas far more difficult. Chloe was an ordinary mortal negress enough, but\r\nDiana might have been the Huntress of the Woods herself, done into the\r\nAfrican type. Tall, large, straight, well-made, profoundly serious, she\r\nstood like a bronze statue, while I, mounted on a stool, (the only way in\r\nwhich I could attain to the noble shoulders and bust of my lay figure),\r\npinned and measured, and cut and shaped, under the superintendence of\r\nM----, and had the satisfaction of seeing the fine proportions of my black\r\ngoddess quite becomingly clothed in a high tight fitting body of the\r\ngayest chintz, which she really contrived to put together quite\r\ncreditably.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Some of our great English ladies are, I know, exquisite\r\nneedlewomen; but I do not think, in spite of these exceptional examples,\r\nthat young English ladies of the higher classes are much skilled in this\r\nrespect at the present day; and as for the democratic daughters of\r\nAmerica, who for many reasons might be supposed likely to be well up in\r\nsuch housewifely lore, they are for the most part so ignorant of it that I\r\nhave heard the most eloquent preacher of the city of New York advert to\r\ntheir incapacity in this respect, as an impediment to their assistance of\r\nthe poor; and ascribe to the fact that the daughters of his own\r\nparishioners did not know how to sew, the impossibility of their giving\r\nthe most valuable species of help to the women of the needier classes,\r\nwhose condition could hardly be more effectually improved than by\r\nacquiring such useful knowledge. I have known young American school girls,\r\nduly instructed in the nature of the parallaxes of the stars, but, as a\r\nrule, they do not know how to darn their stockings. Les Dames du Sacré\r\nCoeur do better for their high-born and well-bred pupils than this.]\r\n\r\nI was so elated with my own part of this performance that I then and\r\nthere determined to put into execution a plan I had long formed of\r\nendowing the little boat in which I take what the French call my walks on\r\nthe water, with cushions for the back and seat of the benches usually\r\noccupied by myself and Mr. ----; so putting on my large straw hat, and\r\nplucking up a paper of pins, scissors, and my brown holland, I walked to\r\nthe steps, and jumping into the little canoe, began piecing, and\r\nmeasuring, and cutting the cushions, which were to be stuffed with the\r\ntree moss by some of the people who understand making a rough kind of\r\nmattress. My inanimate subject, however, proved far more troublesome to\r\nfit than my living lay figure, for the little cockle-shell ducked, and\r\ndived, and rocked, and tipped, and curtseyed, and tilted, as I knelt\r\nfirst on one side and then on the other fitting her, till I was almost\r\nin despair; however, I got a sort of pattern at last, and by dint of some\r\npertinacious efforts--which, in their incompleteness, did not escape some\r\nsarcastic remarks from Mr. ---- on the capabilities of 'women of genius'\r\napplied to common-place objects--the matter was accomplished, and the\r\nlittle Dolphin rejoiced in very tidy back and seat cushions, covered with\r\nbrown holland, and bound with green serge. My ambition then began to\r\ncontemplate an awning, but the boat being of the nature of a\r\ncanoe--though not a real one, inasmuch as it is not made of a single\r\nlog--does not admit of supports for such an edifice.\r\n\r\nI had rather a fright the other day in that same small craft, into which I\r\nhad taken S----, with the intention of paddling myself a little way down\r\nthe river and back. I used to row tolerably well, and was very fond of it,\r\nand frequently here take an oar, when the men are rowing me in the long\r\nboat, as some sort of equivalent for my riding, of which, of course, I am\r\nentirely deprived on this little dykeland of ours; but paddling is a\r\nperfectly different process, and one that I was very anxious to achieve.\r\nMy first strokes answered the purpose of sending the boat off from shore,\r\nand for a few minutes I got on pretty well; but presently I got tired of\r\nshifting the paddle from side to side, a manoeuvre which I accomplished\r\nvery clumsily and slowly, and yet, with all my precautions, not without\r\nmaking the boat tip perilously. The immense breadth and volume of the\r\nriver suddenly seized my eyes and imagination as it were, and I began to\r\nfancy that if I got into the middle of the stream I should not be able to\r\npaddle myself back against it--which, indeed, might very well have proved\r\nthe case. Then I became nervous, and paddled all on one side, by which\r\nmeans, of course, I only turned the boat round. S---- began to fidget\r\nabout, getting up from where I had placed her, and terrifying me with her\r\nunsteady motions and the rocking of the canoe. I was now very much\r\nfrightened, and saw that I _must_ get back to shore before I became more\r\nhelpless than I was beginning to feel; so laying S---- down in the bottom\r\nof the boat as a preliminary precaution, I said to her with infinite\r\nemphasis, 'Now lie still there, and don't stir, or you'll be drowned,' to\r\nwhich, with her clear grey eyes fixed on me, and no sign whatever of\r\nemotion, she replied deliberately, 'I shall lie still here, and won't\r\nstir, for I should not like to be drowned,' which, for an atom not four\r\nyears old, was rather philosophical. Then I looked about me, and of course\r\nhaving drifted, set steadily to work and paddled home, with my heart in my\r\nmouth almost till we grazed the steps, and I got my precious freight safe\r\non shore again, since which I have taken no more paddling lessons without\r\nmy slave and master, Jack.\r\n\r\nWe have had a death among the people since I last wrote to you. A very\r\nvaluable slave called Shadrach was seized with a disease which is\r\nfrequent, and very apt to be fatal here--peri-pneumonia; and in spite of\r\nall that could be done to save him, sank rapidly, and died after an acute\r\nillness of only three days. The doctor came repeatedly from Darien, and\r\nthe last night of the poor fellow's life ---- himself watched with him. I\r\nsuppose the general low diet of the negroes must produce some want of\r\nstamina in them; certainly, either from natural constitution or the effect\r\nof their habits of existence, or both, it is astonishing how much less\r\npower of resistance to disease they seem to possess than we do. If they\r\nare ill, the vital energy seems to sink immediately. This rice\r\ncultivation, too, although it does not affect them as it would whites--to\r\nwhom, indeed, residence on the rice plantation after a certain season is\r\nimpossible--is still, to a certain degree, deleterious even to the\r\nnegroes. The proportion of sick is always greater here than on the cotton\r\nplantation, and the invalids of this place are not unfrequently sent down\r\nto St. Simon's to recover their strength, under the more favourable\r\ninfluences of the sea air and dry sandy soil of Hampton Point.\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon the tepid warmth of the air and glassy stillness of\r\nthe river seemed to me highly suggestive of fishing, and I determined, not\r\nhaving yet discovered what I could catch with what in these unknown\r\nwaters, to try a little innocent paste bait--a mystery his initiation into\r\nwhich caused Jack much wonderment. The only hooks I had with me, however,\r\nhad been bought in Darien--made, I should think, at the North expressly\r\nfor this market; and so villanously bad were they that, after trying them\r\nand my patience a reasonable time, I gave up the attempt and took a lesson\r\nin paddling instead. Amongst other items Jack told me of his own fishing\r\nexperience was, that he had more than once caught those most excellent\r\ncreatures Altamaha shad by the fish themselves leaping out of the water\r\nand _landing_, as Jack expressed it, to escape from the porpoises, which\r\ncome in large schools up the river to a considerable distance,\r\noccasioning, evidently, much emotion in the bosoms of the legitimate\r\ninhabitants of these muddy waters. Coasting the island on our return home\r\nwe found a trap, which the last time we examined it was tenanted by a\r\ncreature called a mink, now occupied by an otter. The poor beast did not\r\nseem pleased with his predicament; but the trap had been set by one of the\r\ndrivers, and, of course, Jack would not have meddled with it except upon\r\nmy express order, which, in spite of some pangs of pity for the otter, I\r\ndid not like to give him, as in the extremely few resources of either\r\nprofit or pleasure possessed by the slaves I could not tell at all what\r\nmight be the value of an otter to his captor.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening the burial of the poor man Shadrach took place. I had\r\nbeen applied to for a sufficient quantity of cotton cloth to make a\r\nwinding-sheet for him, and just as the twilight was thickening into\r\ndarkness I went with Mr. ---- to the cottage of one of the slaves whom I\r\nmay have mentioned to you before--a cooper of the name of London, the head\r\nof the religious party of the inhabitants of the island, a methodist\r\npreacher of no small intelligence and influence among the people--who was\r\nto perform the burial service. The coffin was laid on trestles in front of\r\nthe cooper's cottage, and a large assemblage of the people had gathered\r\nround, many of the men carrying pine-wood torches, the fitful glare of\r\nwhich glanced over the strange assembly, where every pair of large\r\nwhite-rimmed eyes turned upon ---- and myself; we two poor creatures on\r\nthis more solemn occasion, as well as on every other when these people\r\nencounter us, being the objects of admiration and wonderment, on which\r\ntheir gaze is immovably riveted. Presently the whole congregation uplifted\r\ntheir voices in a hymn, the first high wailing notes of which--sung all in\r\nunison, in the midst of these unwonted surroundings--sent a thrill through\r\nall my nerves. When the chant ceased, cooper London began a prayer, and\r\nall the people knelt down in the sand, as I did also. Mr. ---- alone\r\nremained standing in the presence of the dead man, and of the living God\r\nto whom his slaves were now appealing. I cannot tell you how profoundly\r\nthe whole ceremony, if such it could be called, affected me, and there was\r\nnothing in the simple and pathetic supplication of the poor black artisan\r\nto check or interfere with the solemn influences of the whole scene. It\r\nwas a sort of conventional methodist prayer, and probably quite as\r\nconventional as all the rest was the closing invocation of God's blessing\r\nupon their master, their mistress, and our children; but this fairly\r\novercame my composure, and I began to cry very bitterly; for these same\r\nindividuals, whose implication in the state of things in the midst of\r\nwhich we are living, seemed to me as legitimate a cause for tears as for\r\nprayers. When the prayer was concluded we all rose, and the coffin being\r\ntaken up, proceeded to the people's burial-ground, when London read aloud\r\nportions of the funeral service from the prayer-book--I presume the\r\nAmerican episcopal version of our Church service, for what he read\r\nappeared to be merely a selection from what was perfectly familiar to me;\r\nbut whether he himself extracted what he uttered I did not enquire. Indeed\r\nI was too much absorbed in the whole scene, and the many mingled emotions\r\nit excited of awe and pity, and an indescribable sensation of wonder at\r\nfinding myself on this slave soil, surrounded by MY slaves, among whom\r\nagain I knelt while the words proclaiming to the living and the dead the\r\neverlasting covenant of freedom, 'I am the resurrection and the life,'\r\nsounded over the prostrate throng, and mingled with the heavy flowing of\r\nthe vast river sweeping, not far from where we stood, through the darkness\r\nby which we were now encompassed (beyond the immediate circle of our\r\ntorch-bearers). There was something painful to me in ----'s standing\r\nwhile we all knelt on the earth, for though in any church in Philadelphia\r\nhe would have stood during the praying of any minister, here I wished he\r\nwould have knelt, to have given his slaves some token of his belief\r\nthat--at least in the sight of that Master to whom we were addressing our\r\nworship--all men are equal. The service ended with a short address from\r\nLondon upon the subject of Lazarus, and the confirmation which the story\r\nof his resurrection afforded our hopes. The words were simple and rustic,\r\nand of course uttered in the peculiar sort of jargon which is the habitual\r\nnegro speech; but there was nothing in the slightest degree incongruous or\r\ngrotesque in the matter or manner, and the exhortations not to steal, or\r\nlie, or neglect to work well for massa, with which the glorious hope of\r\nimmortality was blended in the poor slave preacher's closing address, was\r\na moral adaptation, as wholesome as it was touching, of the great\r\nChristian theory to the capacities and consciences of his hearers. When\r\nthe coffin was lowered the grave was found to be partially filled with\r\nwater--naturally enough, for the whole island is a mere swamp, off which\r\nthe Altamaha is only kept from sweeping by the high dykes all round it.\r\nThis seemed to shock and distress the people, and for the first time\r\nduring the whole ceremony there were sounds of crying and exclamations of\r\ngrief heard among them. Their chief expression of sorrow, however, when\r\nMr. ---- and myself bade them good night at the conclusion of the\r\nservice, was on account of my crying, which appeared to affect them very\r\nmuch, many of them mingling with their 'Farewell, good night, massa and\r\nmissis,' affectionate exclamations of 'God bless you, missis; don't cry!'\r\n'Lor, missis, don't you cry so!' Mr. ---- declined the assistance of any\r\nof the torch-bearers home, and bade them all go quietly to their quarters;\r\nand as soon as they had dispersed, and we had got beyond the fitful and\r\nunequal glaring of the torches, we found the shining of the stars in the\r\ndeep blue lovely night sky quite sufficient to light our way along the\r\ndykes. I could not speak to ----, but continued to cry as we walked\r\nsilently home; and whatever his cogitations were, they did not take the\r\nunusual form with him of wordy demonstration, and so we returned from one\r\nof the most striking religious ceremonies at which I ever assisted.\r\nArrived at the door of the house we perceived that we had been followed\r\nthe whole way by the naked noiseless feet of a poor half-witted creature,\r\na female idiot, whose mental incapacity, of course, in no respect unfits\r\nher for the life of toil, little more intellectual than that of any beast\r\nof burthen, which is her allotted portion here. Some small gratification\r\nwas given to her, and she departed gibbering and muttering in high glee.\r\nThink, E----, of that man London--who, in spite of all the bitter barriers\r\nin his way, has learnt to read, has read his Bible, teaches it to his\r\nunfortunate fellows, and is used by his owner and his owner's agents, for\r\nall these causes, as an effectual influence for good over the slaves of\r\nwhom he is himself the despised and injured companion. Like them, subject\r\nto the driver's lash; like them, the helpless creature of his master's\r\ndespotic will, without a right or a hope in this dreary world. But though\r\nthe light he has attained must show him the terrible aspects of his fate\r\nhidden by blessed ignorance from his companions, it reveals to him also\r\nother rights, and other hopes--another world, another life--towards which\r\nhe leads, according to the grace vouchsafed him, his poor fellow-slaves.\r\nHow can we keep this man in such a condition? How is such a cruel sin of\r\ninjustice to be answered? Mr. ----, of course, sees and feels none of this\r\nas I do, and I should think must regret that he ever brought me here, to\r\nhave my abhorrence of the theory of slavery deepened, and strengthened\r\nevery hour of my life, by what I see of its practice.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went over to Darien upon the very female errands of\r\nreturning visits and shopping. In one respect (assuredly in none other)\r\nour life here resembles existence in Venice; we can never leave home for\r\nany purpose or in any direction but by boat--not, indeed, by gondola, but\r\nthe sharp cut, well made, light craft in which we take our walks on the\r\nwater is a very agreeable species of conveyance. One of my visits this\r\nmorning was to a certain Miss ----, whose rather grandiloquent name and\r\nvery striking style of beauty exceedingly well became the daughter of an\r\nex-governor of Georgia. As for the residence of this princess, it was like\r\nall the planters' residences that I have seen, and such as a well-to-do\r\nEnglish farmer would certainly not inhabit. Occasional marks of former\r\nelegance or splendour survive sometimes in the size of the rooms,\r\nsometimes in a little carved wood-work about the mantelpieces or\r\nwainscoatings of these mansions; but all things have a Castle Rackrent air\r\nof neglect, and dreary careless untidiness, with which the dirty\r\nbare-footed negro servants are in excellent keeping. Occasionally a huge\r\npair of dazzling shirt gills, out of which a black visage grins as out of\r\nsome vast white paper cornet, adorns the sable footman of the\r\nestablishment, but unfortunately without at all necessarily indicating any\r\ndownward prolongation of the garment; and the perfect tulip bed of a head\r\nhandkerchief with which the female attendants of these 'great families'\r\nlove to bedizen themselves, frequently stands them instead of every other\r\nmost indispensable article of female attire.\r\n\r\nAs for my shopping, the goods or rather 'bads,' at which I used to\r\ngrumble, in your village emporium at Lenox, are what may be termed 'first\r\nrate,' both in excellence and elegance, compared with the vile products of\r\nevery sort which we wretched southerners are expected to accept as the\r\nconveniences of life in exchange for current coin of the realm. I regret\r\nto say, moreover, that all these infamous articles are Yankee\r\nmade--expressly for this market, where every species of _thing_ (to use\r\nthe most general term I can think of), from list shoes to pianofortes, is\r\nprocured from the North--almost always New England, utterly worthless of\r\nits kind, and dearer than the most perfect specimens of the same articles\r\nwould be anywhere else. The incredible variety and ludicrous combinations\r\nof goods to be met with in one of these southern shops beats the stock of\r\nyour village omnium-gatherum hollow to be sure, one class of articles, and\r\nthat probably the most in demand here, is not sold over any counter in\r\nMassachussetts--cow-hides, and man-traps, of which a large assortment\r\nenters necessarily into the furniture of every southern shop.\r\n\r\nIn passing to-day along the deep sand road, calling itself the street of\r\nDarien, my notice was attracted by an extremely handsome and\r\nintelligent-looking poodle, standing by a little wizen-looking\r\nknife-grinder, whose features were evidently European, though he was\r\nnearly as black as a negro who, strange to say, was discoursing with him\r\nin very tolerable French. The impulse of curiosity led me to accost the\r\nman at the grindstone, when his companion immediately made off. The\r\nitinerant artisan was from Aix in Provence; think of wandering thence to\r\nDarien in Georgia! I asked him about the negro who was talking to him; he\r\nsaid he knew nothing of him, but that he was a slave belonging to\r\nsomebody in the town. And upon my expressing surprise at his having left\r\nhis own beautiful and pleasant country for this dreary distant region, he\r\nanswered, with a shrug and a smile, 'Oui, madame, c'est vrai; c'est un\r\njoli pays, mais dans ce pays-là, quand un homme n'a rien, c'est rien pour\r\ntoujours.' A property which many no doubt have come hither, like the\r\nlittle French knife-grinder, to increase, without succeeding in the\r\nstruggle much better than he appeared to have done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----, Having made a fresh and, as I thought, more promising purchase\r\nof fishing-tackle, Jack and I betook ourselves to the river, and succeeded\r\nin securing some immense cat-fish, of which, to tell you the truth, I am\r\nmost horribly afraid when I have caught them. The dexterity necessary for\r\ntaking them off the hook so as to avoid the spikes on their backs, and the\r\nspikes on each side of their gills, the former having to be pressed down,\r\nand the two others pressed up, before you can get any purchase on the\r\nslimy beast (for it is smooth skinned and without scales, to add to the\r\ndifficulty)--these conditions, I say, make the catching of cat-fish\r\nquestionable sport. Then too, they hiss, and spit, and swear at one, and\r\nare altogether devilish in their aspect and demeanour; nor are they good\r\nfor food, except, as Jack with much humility said this morning, for\r\ncoloured folks--'Good for coloured folks, missis; me 'spect not good\r\nenough for white people.' That 'spect, meaning _ex_pect, has sometimes a\r\npossible meaning of _sus_pect, which would give the sentence in which it\r\noccurs a very humorous turn, and I always take the benefit of that\r\ninterpretation. After exhausting the charms of our occupation, finding\r\nthat cat-fish were likely to be our principal haul, I left the river and\r\nwent my rounds to the hospitals. On my way I encountered two batches of\r\nsmall black fry, Hannah's children and poor Psyche's children, looking\r\nreally as neat and tidy as children of the bettermost class of artisans\r\namong ourselves. These people are so quick and so imitative that it would\r\nbe the easiest thing in the world to improve their physical condition by\r\nappealing to their emulative propensities. Their passion for what is\r\n_genteel_ might be used most advantageously in the same direction; and\r\nindeed, I think it would be difficult to find people who offered such a\r\nfair purchase by so many of their characteristics to the hand of the\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\nReturning from the hospital I was accosted by poor old Teresa, the\r\nwretched negress who had complained to me so grievously of her back being\r\nbroken by hard work and child-bearing. She was in a dreadful state of\r\nexcitement, which she partly presently communicated to me, because she\r\nsaid Mr. O---- had ordered her to be flogged for having complained to me\r\nas she did. It seems to me that I have come down here to be tortured, for\r\nthis punishing these wretched creatures for crying out to me for help is\r\nreally converting me into a source of increased misery to them. It is\r\nalmost more than I can endure to hear these horrid stories of lashings\r\ninflicted because I have been invoked; and though I dare say Mr. ----,\r\nthanks to my passionate appeals to him, gives me little credit for\r\nprudence or self-command, I have some, and I exercise it too when I listen\r\nto such tales as these with my teeth set fast and my lips closed. Whatever\r\nI may do to the master, I hold my tongue to the slaves, and I wonder how I\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I rowed with Mr. ---- to another island in the broad\r\nwaters of the Altamaha, called Tunno's Island, to return the visit of a\r\ncertain Dr. T----, the proprietor of the island, named after him, as our\r\nrice swamp is after Major ----. I here saw growing in the open air the\r\nmost beautiful gardinias I ever beheld; the branches were as high and as\r\nthick as the largest clumps of Kalmia, that grow in your woods, but\r\nwhereas the tough, stringy, fibrous branches of these gives them a\r\nstraggling appearance, these magnificent masses of dark shiny glossy green\r\nleaves were quite compact; and I cannot conceive anything lovelier or more\r\ndelightful than they would be starred all over with their thick-leaved\r\ncream-white odoriferous blossoms.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our visit a discussion arose as to the credibility of any\r\nnegro assertion, though, indeed, that could hardly be called a discussion\r\nthat was simply a chorus of assenting opinions. No negro was to be\r\nbelieved on any occasion or any subject. No doubt they are habitual liars,\r\nfor they are slaves, but there are some thrice honourable exceptions who,\r\nbeing slaves, are yet not liars; and certainly the vice results much more\r\nfrom the circumstances in which they are placed than from any natural\r\ntendency to untruth in their case. The truth is that they are always\r\nconsidered as false and deceitful, and it is very seldom that any special\r\ninvestigation of the facts of any particular case is resorted to in their\r\nbehalf. They are always prejudged on their supposed general\r\ncharacteristics, and never judged after the fact on the merit of any\r\nspecial instance.\r\n\r\nA question which was discussed in the real sense of the term, was that of\r\nploughing the land instead of having it turned with the spade or hoe. I\r\nlistened to this with great interest, for Jack and I had had some talk\r\nupon this subject, which began in his ardently expressed wish that massa\r\nwould allow his land to be ploughed, and his despairing conclusion that he\r\nnever would, ''cause horses more costly to keep than coloured folks,' and\r\nploughing, therefore, dearer than hoeing or digging. I had ventured to\r\nsuggest to Mr. ----- the possibility of ploughing some of the fields on\r\nthe island, and his reply was that the whole land was too moist and too\r\nmuch interrupted with the huge masses of the Cypress yam roots, which\r\nwould turn the share of any plough. Yet there is land belonging to our\r\nneighbour Mr. G----, on the other side of the river, where the conditions\r\nof the soil must be precisely the same, and yet which is being ploughed\r\nbefore our faces. On Mr. ----'s adjacent plantation the plough is also\r\nused extensively and successfully.\r\n\r\nOn my return to our own island I visited another of the hospitals, and the\r\nsettlements to which it belonged. The condition of these places and of\r\ntheir inhabitants is, of course, the same all over the plantation, and if\r\nI were to describe them I should but weary you with a repetition of\r\nidentical phenomena: filthy, wretched, almost naked, always bare-legged\r\nand bare-footed children; negligent, ignorant, wretched mothers, whose\r\napparent indifference to the plight of their offspring, and utter\r\nincapacity to alter it, are the inevitable result of their slavery. It is\r\nhopeless to attempt to reform their habits or improve their condition\r\nwhile the women are condemned to field labour; nor is it possible to\r\noverestimate the bad moral effect of the system as regards the women\r\nentailing this enforced separation from their children and neglect of all\r\nthe cares and duties of mother, nurse, and even house-wife, which are all\r\nmerged in the mere physical toil of a human hoeing machine. It seems to me\r\ntoo--but upon this point I cannot, of course, judge as well as the persons\r\naccustomed to and acquainted with the physical capacities of their\r\nslaves--that the labour is not judiciously distributed in many cases; at\r\nleast, not as far as the women are concerned. It is true that every\r\nable-bodied woman is made the most of in being driven a-field as long as\r\nunder all and any circumstances she is able to wield a hoe; but on the\r\nother hand, stout, hale, hearty girls and boys, of from eight to twelve\r\nand older, are allowed to lounge about filthy and idle, with no pretence\r\nof an occupation but what they call 'tend baby,' i.e. see to the life and\r\nlimbs of the little slave infants, to whose mothers, working in distant\r\nfields, they carry them during the day to be suckled, and for the rest of\r\nthe time leave them to crawl and kick in the filthy cabins or on the\r\nbroiling sand which surrounds them, in which industry, excellent enough\r\nfor the poor babies, these big lazy youths and lasses emulate them. Again,\r\nI find many women who have borne from five to ten children rated as\r\nworkers, precisely as young women in the prime of their strength who have\r\nhad none; this seems a cruel carelessness. To be sure, while the women are\r\npregnant their task is diminished, and this is one of the many indirect\r\ninducements held out to reckless propagation, which has a sort of premium\r\noffered to it in the consideration of less work and more food,\r\ncounterbalanced by none of the sacred responsibilities which hallow and\r\nennoble the relation of parent and child; in short, as their lives are for\r\nthe most part those of mere animals, their increase is literally mere\r\nanimal breeding, to which every encouragement is given, for it adds to\r\nthe master's live stock, and the value of his estate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. To-day, I have the pleasure of announcing to you a variety of\r\nimprovements about to be made in the infirmary of the island. There is to\r\nbe a third story--a mere loft indeed--added to the buildings, but by\r\naffording more room for the least distressing cases of sickness to be\r\ndrafted off into, it will leave the ground-floor and room above it\r\ncomparatively free for the most miserable of these unfortunates. To my\r\nunspeakable satisfaction these destitute apartments are to be furnished\r\nwith bedsteads, mattresses, pillows, and blankets; and I feel a little\r\ncomforted for the many heart-aches my life here inflicts upon me: at least\r\nsome of my twinges will have wrought this poor alleviation of their\r\nwretchedness for the slaves, when prostrated by disease or pain.\r\n\r\nI had hardly time to return from the hospital home this morning before one\r\nof the most tremendous storms I ever saw burst over the island. Your\r\nnorthern hills, with their solemn pine woods, and fresh streams and lakes,\r\ntelling of a cold rather than a warm climate, always seem to me as if\r\nundergoing some strange and unnatural visitation, when one of your heavy\r\nsummer thunder-storms bursts over them. Snow and frost, hail and, above\r\nall, wind, trailing rain clouds and brilliant northern lights, are your\r\nappropriate sky phenomena; here, thunder and lightning seem as if they\r\nmight have been invented. Even in winter (remember, we are now in\r\nFebruary) they appear neither astonishing nor unseasonable, and I should\r\nthink in summer (but Heaven defend me from ever making good my\r\nsupposition) lightning must be as familiar to these sweltering lands and\r\nslimy waters as sunlight itself.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon cleared off most beautifully, and Jack and I went out on the\r\nriver to catch what might be caught. Jack's joyful excitement was extreme\r\nat my announcing to him the fact that Mr. ---- had consented to try\r\nploughing on some of the driest portions of the island instead of the slow\r\nand laborious process of hoeing the fields; this is a disinterested\r\nexultation on his part, for at any rate as long as I am here, he will\r\ncertainly be nothing but 'my boy Jack,' and I should think after my\r\ndeparture will never be degraded to the rank of a field-hand or common\r\nlabourer. Indeed the delicacy of his health, to which his slight slender\r\nfigure and languid face bear witness, and which was one reason of his\r\nappointment to the eminence of being 'my slave,' would, I should think,\r\nprevent the poor fellow's ever being a very robust or useful working\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nOn my return from the river I had a long and painful conversation with\r\nMr. ---- upon the subject of the flogging which had been inflicted on the\r\nwretched Teresa. These discussions are terrible: they throw me into\r\nperfect agonies of distress for the slaves, whose position is utterly\r\nhopeless; for myself, whose intervention in their behalf sometimes seems\r\nto me worse than useless; for Mr. ----, whose share in this horrible\r\nsystem fills me by turns with indignation and pity. But, after all, what\r\ncan he do? how can he help it all? Moreover, born and bred in America,\r\nhow should he care or wish to help it? and of course he does not; and I\r\nam in despair that he does not: et voilà, it is a happy and hopeful\r\nplight for us both. He maintained that there had been neither hardship\r\nnor injustice in the case of Teresa's flogging; and that, moreover, she\r\nhad not been flogged at all for complaining to me, but simply because her\r\nallotted task was not done at the appointed time. Of course this was the\r\nresult of her having come to appeal to me, instead of going to her\r\nlabour; and as she knew perfectly well the penalty she was incurring, he\r\nmaintained that there was neither hardship nor injustice in the case; the\r\nwhole thing was a regularly established law, with which all the slaves\r\nwere perfectly well acquainted; and this case was no exception whatever.\r\nThe circumstance of my being on the island could not of course be allowed\r\nto overthrow the whole system of discipline established to secure the\r\nlabour and obedience of the slaves; and if they chose to try experiments\r\nas to that fact, they and I must take the consequences. At the end of the\r\nday, the driver of the gang to which Teresa belongs reported her work\r\nnot done, and Mr. O---- ordered him to give her the usual number of\r\nstripes; which order the driver of course obeyed, without knowing how\r\nTeresa had employed her time instead of hoeing. But Mr. O---- knew well\r\nenough, for the wretched woman told me that she had herself told him she\r\nshould appeal to me about her weakness and suffering and inability to do\r\nthe work exacted from her.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, think proper to exceed in her punishment the usual\r\nnumber of stripes allotted to the non-performance of the appointed daily\r\ntask, and Mr. ---- pronounced the whole transaction perfectly satisfactory\r\nand _en règle_. The common drivers are limited in their powers of\r\nchastisement, not being allowed to administer more than a certain number\r\nof lashes to their fellow slaves. Head man Frank, as he is called, has\r\nalone the privilege of exceeding this limit; and the overseer's latitude\r\nof infliction is only curtailed by the necessity of avoiding injury to\r\nlife or limb. The master's irresponsible power has no such bound. When I\r\nwas thus silenced on the particular case under discussion, I resorted in\r\nmy distress and indignation to the abstract question, as I never can\r\nrefrain from doing; and to Mr. ----'s assertion of the justice of poor\r\nTeresa's punishment, I retorted the manifest injustice of unpaid and\r\nenforced labour; the brutal inhumanity of allowing a man to strip and\r\nlash a woman, the mother of ten children; to exact from her toil which was\r\nto maintain in luxury two idle young men, the owners of the plantation. I\r\nsaid I thought female labour of the sort exacted from these slaves, and\r\ncorporal chastisement such as they endure, must be abhorrent to any manly\r\nor humane man. Mr. ---- said he thought it was _disagreeable_, and left me\r\nto my reflections with that concession. My letter has been interrupted for\r\nthe last three days; by nothing special, however. My occupations and\r\ninterests here of course know no change; but Mr. ---- has been anxious for\r\na little while past that we should go down to St. Simon's, the cotton\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nWe shall suffer less from the heat, which I am beginning to find\r\noppressive on this swamp island; and he himself wished to visit that part\r\nof his property, whither he had not yet been since our arrival in Georgia.\r\nSo the day before yesterday he departed to make the necessary arrangements\r\nfor our removal thither; and my time in the meanwhile has been taken up in\r\nfitting him out for his departure.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Jack and I took our usual paddle, and having the tackle on\r\nboard, tried fishing. I was absorbed in many sad and serious\r\nconsiderations, and wonderful to relate (for you know ---- how keen an\r\nangler I am), had lost all consciousness of my occupation, until after I\r\nknow not how long a time elapsing without the shadow of a nibble, I was\r\nrecalled to a most ludicrous perception of my ill-success by Jack's\r\nsudden observation, 'Missis, fishing berry good fun when um fish bite.'\r\nThis settled the fishing for that morning, and I let Jack paddle me down\r\nthe broad turbid stream, endeavouring to answer in the most comprehensible\r\nmanner to his keen but utterly undeveloped intellects the innumerable\r\nquestions with which he plied me about Philadelphia, about England, about\r\nthe Atlantic, &c. He dilated much upon the charms of St. Simon's, to which\r\nhe appeared very glad that we were going; and among other items of\r\ndescription mentioned, what I was very glad to hear, that it was a\r\nbeautiful place for riding, and that I should be able to indulge to my\r\nheart's content in my favourite exercise, from which I have, of course,\r\nbeen utterly debarred in this small dykeland of ours. He insinuated more\r\nthan once his hope and desire that he might be allowed to accompany me,\r\nbut as I knew nothing at all about his capacity for equestrian exercises,\r\nor any of the arrangements that might or might not interfere with such a\r\nplan, I was discreetly silent, and took no notice of his most comically\r\nturned hints on the subject. In our row we started a quantity of wild\r\nduck, and he told me that there was a great deal of game at St. Simon's,\r\nbut that the people did not contrive to catch much, though they laid traps\r\nconstantly for it. Of course their possessing firearms is quite out of\r\nthe question; but this abundance of what must be to them such especially\r\ndesirable prey, makes the fact a great hardship. I almost wonder they\r\ndon't learn to shoot like savages with bows and arrows, but these would be\r\nweapons, and equally forbidden them.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I saw Mr. ---- off for St. Simon's; it is fifteen miles\r\nlower down the river, and a large island at the very mouth of the\r\nAltamaha.\r\n\r\nThe boat he went in was a large, broad, rather heavy, though well-built\r\ncraft, by no means as swift or elegant as the narrow eight-oared long boat\r\nin which he generally takes his walks on the water, but well adapted for\r\nthe traffic between the two plantations, where it serves the purpose of a\r\nsort of omnibus or stage-coach for the transfer of the people from one to\r\nthe other, and of a baggage waggon or cart for the conveyance of all sorts\r\nof household goods, chattels, and necessaries. Mr. ---- sat in the middle\r\nof a perfect chaos of such freight; and as the boat pushed off, and the\r\nsteersman took her into the stream, the men at the oars set up a chorus,\r\nwhich they continued to chaunt in unison with each other, and in time with\r\ntheir stroke, till the voices and oars were heard no more from the\r\ndistance. I believe I have mentioned to you before the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of this veritable negro minstrelsy--how they all sing in\r\nunison, having never, it appears, attempted or heard anything like\r\npart-singing. Their voices seem oftener tenor than any other quality, and\r\nthe tune and time they keep something quite wonderful; such truth of\r\nintonation and accent would make almost any music agreeable. That which I\r\nhave heard these people sing is often plaintive and pretty, but almost\r\nalways has some resemblance to tunes with which they must have become\r\nacquainted through the instrumentality of white men; their overseers or\r\nmasters whistling Scotch or Irish airs, of which they have produced by ear\r\nthese _rifacciamenti_. The note for note reproduction of 'Ah! vous\r\ndirai-je, maman?' in one of the most popular of the so-called Negro\r\nmelodies with which all America and England are familiar, is an example of\r\nthis very transparent plagiarism; and the tune with which Mr. ----'s\r\nrowers started him down the Altamaha, as I stood at the steps to see him\r\noff, was a very distinct descendant of 'Coming through the Rye.' The\r\nwords, however, were astonishingly primitive, especially the first line,\r\nwhich, when it burst from their eight throats in high unison, sent me into\r\nfits of laughter.\r\n\r\n    Jenny shake her toe at me,\r\n    Jenny gone away;\r\n    Jenny shake her toe at me,\r\n    Jenny gone away.\r\n    Hurrah! Miss Susy, oh!\r\n    Jenny gone away;\r\n    Hurrah! Miss Susy, oh!\r\n    Jenny gone away.\r\n\r\nWhat the obnoxious Jenny meant by shaking her toe, whether defiance or\r\nmere departure, I never could ascertain, but her going away was an\r\nunmistakable subject of satisfaction; and the pause made on the last 'oh!'\r\nbefore the final announcement of her departure, had really a good deal of\r\ndramatic and musical effect. Except the extemporaneous chaunts in our\r\nhonour, of which I have written to you before, I have never heard the\r\nnegroes on Mr. ----'s plantation sing any words that could be said to have\r\nany sense. To one, an extremely pretty, plaintive, and original air, there\r\nwas but one line, which was repeated with a sort of wailing chorus--\r\n\r\n    Oh! my massa told me, there's no grass in Georgia.\r\n\r\nUpon enquiring the meaning of which, I was told it was supposed to be the\r\nlamentation of a slave from one of the more northerly states, Virginia or\r\nCarolina, where the labour of hoeing the weeds, or grass as they call it,\r\nis not nearly so severe as here, in the rice and cotton lands of Georgia.\r\nAnother very pretty and pathetic tune began with words that seemed to\r\npromise something sentimental--\r\n\r\n    Fare you well, and good-bye, oh, oh!\r\n    I'm goin' away to leave you, oh, oh!\r\n\r\nbut immediately went off into nonsense verses about gentlemen in the\r\nparlour drinking wine and cordial, and ladies in the drawing-room drinking\r\ntea and coffee, &c. I have heard that many of the masters and overseers on\r\nthese plantations prohibit melancholy tunes or words, and encourage\r\nnothing but cheerful music and senseless words, deprecating the effect of\r\nsadder strains upon the slaves, whose peculiar musical sensibility might\r\nbe expected to make them especially excitable by any songs of a plaintive\r\ncharacter, and having any reference to their particular hardships. If it\r\nis true, I think it a judicious precaution enough--these poor slaves are\r\njust the sort of people over whom a popular musical appeal to their\r\nfeelings and passions would have an immense power.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Mr. ----'s departure left me to the pleasures of an\r\nuninterrupted _tête-à-tête_ with his crosseyed overseer, and I\r\nendeavoured, as I generally do, to atone by my conversibleness and\r\ncivility for the additional trouble which, no doubt, all my outlandish\r\nways and notions are causing the worthy man. So suggestive (to use the\r\nnew-fangled jargon about books) a woman as myself is, I suspect, an\r\nintolerable nuisance in these parts; and poor Mr. O---- cannot very well\r\ndesire Mr. ---- to send me away, however much he may wish that he would;\r\nso that figuratively, as well as literally, I fear the worthy master _me\r\nvoit d'un mauvais oeil_, as the French say. I asked him several questions\r\nabout some of the slaves who had managed to learn to read, and by what\r\nmeans they had been able to do so. As teaching them is strictly prohibited\r\nby the laws, they who instructed them, and such of them as acquired the\r\nknowledge, must have been not a little determined and persevering. This\r\nwas my view of the case, of course, and of course it was not the\r\noverseer's. I asked him if many of Mr. ----'s slaves could read. He said\r\n'No; very few, he was happy to say, but those few were just so many too\r\nmany.' 'Why, had he observed any insubordination in those who did?' And I\r\nreminded him of Cooper London, the methodist preacher, whose performance\r\nof the burial service had struck me so much some time ago--to whose\r\nexemplary conduct and character there is but one concurrent testimony all\r\nover the plantation. No; he had no special complaint to bring against the\r\nlettered members of his subject community, but he spoke by anticipation.\r\nEvery step they take towards intelligence and enlightenment lessens the\r\nprobability of their acquiescing in their condition. Their condition is\r\nnot to be changed--ergo, they had better not learn to read; a very\r\nsuccinct and satisfactory argument as far as it goes, no doubt, and one to\r\nwhich I had not a word to reply, at any rate, to Mr. O----, as I did not\r\nfeel called upon to discuss the abstract justice or equity of the matter\r\nwith him; indeed he, to a certain degree, gave up that part of the\r\nposition, starting with 'I don't say whether it's right or wrong;' and in\r\nall conversations that I have had with the southerners upon these\r\nsubjects, whether out of civility to what may be supposed to be an\r\nEnglishwoman's prejudices, or a forlorn respect to their own convictions,\r\nthe question of the fundamental wrong of slavery is generally admitted, or\r\nat any rate certainly never denied. That part of the subject is summarily\r\ndismissed, and all its other aspects vindicated, excused, and even lauded,\r\nwith untiring eloquence. Of course, of the abstract question I could judge\r\nbefore I came here, but I confess I had not the remotest idea how\r\nabsolutely my observation of every detail of the system, as a practical\r\niniquity, would go to confirm my opinion of its abomination. Mr. O----\r\nwent on to condemn and utterly denounce all the preaching and teaching and\r\nmoral instruction upon religious subjects, which people in the south,\r\npressed upon by northern opinion, are endeavouring to give their slaves.\r\nThe kinder and the more cowardly masters are anxious to evade the charge\r\nof keeping their negroes in brutish ignorance, and so they crumble what\r\nthey suppose and hope may prove a little harmless, religious\r\nenlightenment, which, mixed up with much religious authority on the\r\nsubject of submission and fidelity to masters, they trust their slaves may\r\nswallow without its doing them any harm--i.e., that they may be better\r\nChristians and better slaves--and so, indeed, no doubt they are; but it is\r\na very dangerous experiment, and from Mr. O----'s point of view I quite\r\nagree with him. The letting out of water, or the letting in of light, in\r\ninfinitesimal quantities, is not always easy. The half-wicked of the earth\r\nare the leaks through which wickedness is eventually swamped; compromises\r\nforerun absolute surrender in most matters, and fools and cowards are, in\r\nsuch cases, the instruments of Providence for their own defeat. Mr. O----\r\nstated unequivocally his opinion that free labour would be more profitable\r\non the plantations than the work of slaves, which, being compulsory, was\r\nof the worst possible quality and the smallest possible quantity; then the\r\ncharge of them before and after they are able to work is onerous, the cost\r\nof feeding and clothing them very considerable, and upon the whole he, a\r\nsouthern overseer, pronounced himself decidedly in favour of free labour,\r\nupon grounds of expediency. Having at the beginning of our conversation\r\ndeclined discussing the moral aspect of slavery, evidently not thinking\r\nthat position tenable, I thought I had every right to consider Mr. ----'s\r\nslave-driver a decided abolitionist.\r\n\r\nI had been anxious to enlist his sympathies on behalf of my extreme\r\ndesire, to have some sort of garden, but did not succeed in inspiring him\r\nwith my enthusiasm on the subject; he said there was but one garden that\r\nhe knew of in the whole neighbourhood of Darien, and that was our\r\nneighbour, old Mr. C----'s, a Scotchman on St. Simon's. I remembered the\r\nsplendid gardinias on Tunno's Island, and referred to them as a proof of\r\nthe material for ornamental gardening. He laughed, and said rice and\r\ncotton crops were the ornamental gardening principally admired by the\r\nplanters, and that, to the best of his belief, there was not another\r\ndecent kitchen or flower garden in the State, but the one he had\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe next day after this conversation, I walked with my horticultural\r\nzeal much damped, and wandered along the dyke by the broad river,\r\nlooking at some pretty peach trees in blossom, and thinking what a curse\r\nof utter stagnation this slavery produces, and how intolerable to me a\r\nlife passed within its stifling influence would be. Think of peach trees\r\nin blossom in the middle of February! It does seem cruel, with such a\r\nsun and soil, to be told that a garden is worth nobody's while here;\r\nhowever, Mr. O---- said that he believed the wife of the former overseer\r\nhad made a 'sort of a garden' at St. Simon's. We shall see 'what sort'\r\nit turns out to be. While I was standing on the dyke, ruminating above\r\nthe river, I saw a beautiful white bird of the crane species alight not\r\nfar from me. I do not think a little knowledge of natural history would\r\ndiminish the surprise and admiration with which I regard the, to me,\r\nunwonted specimens of animal existence that I encounter every day, and\r\nof which I do not even know the names. Ignorance is an odious thing. The\r\nbirds here are especially beautiful, I think. I saw one the other day,\r\nof what species of course I do not know, of a warm and rich brown, with\r\na scarlet hood and crest--a lovely creature, about the size of your\r\nnorthern robin, but more elegantly shaped.\r\n\r\nThis morning, instead of my usual visit to the infirmary, I went to look\r\nat the work and workers in the threshing mill--all was going on actively\r\nand orderly under the superintendence of head-man Frank, with whom, and a\r\nvery sagacious clever fellow, who manages the steam power of the mill,\r\nand is honourably distinguished as Engineer Ned, I had a small chat.\r\nThere is one among various drawbacks to the comfort and pleasure of our\r\nintercourse with these coloured 'men and brethren,' at least in their\r\nslave condition, which certainly exercises my fortitude not a\r\nlittle,--the swarms of fleas that cohabit with these sable dependants of\r\nours are--well--incredible; moreover they are by no means the only or\r\nmost objectionable companions one borrows from them, and I never go to\r\nthe infirmary, where I not unfrequently am requested to look at very\r\ndirty limbs and bodies in very dirty draperies, without coming away with\r\na strong inclination to throw myself into the water, and my clothes into\r\nthe fire, which last would be expensive. I do not suppose that these\r\nhateful consequences of dirt and disorder are worse here than among the\r\npoor and neglected human creatures who swarm in the lower parts of\r\nEuropean cities; but my call to visit them has never been such as that\r\nwhich constrains me to go daily among these poor people, and although on\r\none or two occasions I have penetrated into fearfully foul and filthy\r\nabodes of misery in London, I have never rendered the same personal\r\nservices to their inhabitants that I do to Mr. ----'s slaves, and so\r\nhave not incurred the same amount of entomological inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the mill, I prolonged my walk, and came, for the first time,\r\nupon one of the 'gangs,' as they are called, in full field work. Upon my\r\nappearance and approach there was a momentary suspension of labour, and\r\nthe usual chorus of screams and ejaculations of welcome, affection, and\r\ninfinite desires for infinite small indulgences. I was afraid to stop\r\ntheir work, not feeling at all sure that urging a conversation with me\r\nwould be accepted as any excuse for an uncompleted task, or avert the\r\nfatal infliction of the usual award of stripes; so I hurried off and left\r\nthem to their hoeing.\r\n\r\nOn my way home I was encountered by London, our Methodist preacher, who\r\naccosted me with a request for a prayer-book and Bible, and expressed his\r\nregret at hearing that we were so soon going to St. Simon's. I promised\r\nhim his holy books, and asked him how he had learned to read, but found it\r\nimpossible to get him to tell me. I wonder if he thought he should be\r\nputting his teacher, whoever he was, in danger of the penalty of the law\r\nagainst instructing the slaves, if he told me who he was; it was\r\nimpossible to make him do so, so that, besides his other good qualities,\r\nhe appears to have that most unusual one of all in an uneducated\r\nperson--discretion. He certainly is a most remarkable man.\r\n\r\nAfter parting with him, I was assailed by a small gang of children,\r\nclamouring for the indulgence of some meat, which they besought me to\r\ngive them. Animal food is only allowed to certain of the harder working\r\nmen, hedgers and ditchers, and to them only occasionally, and in very\r\nmoderate rations. My small cannibals clamoured round me for flesh, as if I\r\nhad had a butcher's cart in my pocket, till I began to laugh and then to\r\nrun, and away they came, like a pack of little black wolves, at my heels,\r\nshrieking, 'Missis, you gib me piece meat, missis, you gib me meat,' till\r\nI got home. At the door I found another petitioner, a young woman named\r\nMaria, who brought a fine child in her arms, and demanded a present of a\r\npiece of flannel. Upon my asking her who her husband was, she replied,\r\nwithout much hesitation, that she did not possess any such appendage. I\r\ngave another look at her bonny baby, and went into the house to get the\r\nflannel for her. I afterwards heard from Mr. ---- that she and two other\r\ngirls of her age, about seventeen, were the only instances on the island\r\nof women with illegitimate children.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been in the house a little while, I was summoned out again to\r\nreceive the petition of certain poor women in the family-way to have their\r\nwork lightened. I was, of course, obliged to tell them that I could not\r\ninterfere in the matter, that their master was away, and that, when he\r\ncame back, they must present their request to him: they said they had\r\nalready begged 'massa,' and he had refused, and they thought, perhaps, if\r\n'missis' begged 'massa' for them, he would lighten their task. Poor\r\n'missis,' poor 'massa,' poor woman, that I am to have such prayers\r\naddressed to me! I had to tell them, that if they had already spoken to\r\ntheir master, I was afraid my doing so would be of no use, but that when\r\nhe came back I would try; so, choking with crying, I turned away from\r\nthem, and re-entered the house, to the chorus of 'Oh, thank you, missis!\r\nGod bless you, missis!' E----, I think an improvement might be made upon\r\nthat caricature published a short time ago, called the 'Chivalry of the\r\nSouth.' I think an elegant young Carolinian, or Georgian gentleman, whip\r\nin hand, driving a gang of 'lusty women,' as they are called here, would\r\nbe a pretty version of the 'Chivalry of the South'--a little coarse, I am\r\nafraid you will say. Oh! quite horribly coarse, but then so true--a great\r\nmatter in works of art, which, now-a-days, appear to be thought excellent\r\nonly in proportion to their lack of ideal elevation. That would be a\r\nsubject, and a treatment of it, which could not be accused of imaginative\r\nexaggeration, at any rate.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I mentioned the petitions of these poor women to Mr. O----,\r\nthinking that perhaps he had the power to lessen their tasks. He seemed\r\nevidently annoyed at their having appealed to me; said that their work was\r\nnot a bit too much for them, and that constantly they were _shamming_\r\nthemselves in the family-way, in order to obtain a diminution of their\r\nlabour. Poor creatures! I suppose some of them do; but again, it must be\r\na hard matter for those who do not, not to obtain the mitigation of their\r\ntoil which their condition requires; for their assertion and their\r\nevidence are never received--they can't be believed, even if they were\r\nupon oath, say their white taskmasters; why? because they have never been\r\ntaught the obligations of an oath, to whom made, or wherefore binding; and\r\nthey are punished both directly and indirectly for their moral ignorance,\r\nas if it were a natural and incorrigible element of their character,\r\ninstead of the inevitable result of their miserable position. The oath of\r\nany and every scoundrelly fellow with a white skin is received, but not\r\nthat of such a man as Frank, Ned, old Jacob, or Cooper London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I think it right to begin this letter with an account of a\r\nmost prosperous fishing expedition Jack and I achieved the other morning.\r\nIt is true we still occasionally drew up huge cat-fish, with their\r\ndetestable beards and spikes, but we also captivated some magnificent\r\nperch, and the Altamaha perch are worth one's while both to catch and to\r\neat. On a visit I had to make on the mainland, the same day, I saw a tiny\r\nstrip of garden ground, rescued from the sandy road, called the street,\r\nperfectly filled with hyacinths, double jonquils, and snowdrops, a\r\ncharming nosegay for February 11. After leaving the boat on my return\r\nhome, I encountered a curious creature walking all sideways, a small cross\r\nbetween a lobster and a crab. One of the negroes to whom I applied for its\r\ndenomination informed me that it was a land crab, with which general\r\ndescription of this very peculiar multipede you must be satisfied, for I\r\ncan tell you no more. I went a little further, as the nursery rhyme says,\r\nand met with a snake, and not being able to determine, at ignorant first\r\nsight, whether it was a malignant serpent or not, I ingloriously took to\r\nmy heels, and came home on the full run. It is the first of these\r\nexceedingly displeasing animals I have encountered here; but Jack, for my\r\nconsolation, tells me that they abound on St. Simon's, whither we are\r\ngoing--'rattlesnakes, and all kinds,' says he, with an affluence of\r\npromise in his tone that is quite agreeable. Rattlesnakes will be quite\r\nenough of a treat, without the vague horrors that may be comprised in the\r\nadditional 'all kinds.' Jack's account of the game on St. Simon's is\r\nreally quite tantalising to me, who cannot carry a gun any more than if I\r\nwere a slave. He says that partridges, woodcocks, snipe, and wild duck\r\nabound, so that, at any rate, our table ought to be well supplied. His\r\naccount of the bears that are still to be found in the woods of the\r\nmainland, is not so pleasant, though he says they do no harm to the\r\npeople, if they are not meddled with, but that they steal the corn from\r\nthe fields when it is ripe, and actually swim the river to commit their\r\ndepredations on the islands. It seems difficult to believe this, looking\r\nat this wide and heavy stream--though, to be sure, I did once see a young\r\nhorse swim across the St. Lawrence, between Montreal and Quebec; a feat of\r\nnatation which much enlarged my belief in what quadrupeds may accomplish\r\nwhen they have no choice between swimming and sinking.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how great a triumph the virtue next to godliness is\r\nmaking under my auspices and a judicious system of small bribery. I can\r\nhardly stir now without being assailed with cries of 'Missis, missis me\r\nmind chile, me bery clean,' or the additional gratifying fact, 'and chile\r\ntoo, him bery clean.' This virtue, however, if painful to the practisers,\r\nas no doubt it is, is expensive, too, to me, and I shall have to try some\r\nmoral influence equivalent in value to a cent current coin of the realm.\r\nWhat a poor chance, indeed, the poor abstract idea runs! however, it is\r\nreally a comfort to see the poor little woolly heads, now in most\r\ninstances stripped of their additional filthy artificial envelopes.\r\n\r\nIn my afternoon's row to-day I passed a huge dead alligator, lying half in\r\nand half out of the muddy slime of the river bank--a most hideous object\r\nit was, and I was glad to turn my eyes to the beautiful surface of the mid\r\nstream, all burnished with sunset glories, and broken with the vivacious\r\ngambols of a school of porpoises. It is curious, I think, that these\r\ncreatures should come fifteen miles from the sea to enliven the waters\r\nround our little rice swamp.\r\n\r\nWhile rowing this evening, I was led by my conversation with Jack to some\r\nof those reflections with which my mind is naturally incessantly filled\r\nhere, but which I am obliged to be very careful not to give any utterance\r\nto. The testimony of no negro is received in a southern court of law, and\r\nthe reason commonly adduced for this is, that the state of ignorance in\r\nwhich the negroes are necessarily kept, renders them incapable of\r\ncomprehending the obligations of an oath, and yet with an inconsistency\r\nwhich might be said to border on effrontery, these same people are\r\nadmitted to the most holy sacrament of the Church, and are certainly\r\nthereby supposed to be capable of assuming the highest Christian\r\nobligations, and the entire fulfilment of God's commandments--including,\r\nof course, the duty of speaking the truth at all times.\r\n\r\nAs we were proceeding down the river, we met the flat, as it is called,\r\na huge sort of clumsy boat, more like a raft than any other species\r\nof craft, coming up from St. Simon's with its usual swarthy freight\r\nof Mr. ----'s dependants from that place. I made Jack turn our canoe,\r\nbecause the universal outcries and exclamations very distinctly intimated\r\nthat I should be expected to be at home to receive the homage of this\r\ncargo of 'massa's people.' No sooner, indeed, had I disembarked and\r\nreached the house, than a dark cloud of black life filled the piazza\r\nand swarmed up the steps, and I had to shake hands, like a popular\r\npresident, till my arm ached at the shoulder-joint.\r\n\r\nWhen this tribe had dispersed itself, a very old woman with a remarkably\r\nintelligent, nice-looking young girl, came forward and claimed my\r\nattention. The old woman, who must, I think, by her appearance, have been\r\nnear seventy, had been one of the house servants on St. Simon's Island in\r\nMajor ----'s time, and retained a certain dignified courtesy and\r\nrespectfulness of manner which is by no means an uncommon attribute of the\r\nbetter class of slaves, whose intercourse with their masters, while\r\ntending to expand their intelligence, cultivates, at the same time, the\r\nnatural turn for good manners which is, I think, a distinctive peculiarity\r\nof negroes, if not in the kingdom of Dahomey, certainly in the United\r\nStates of America. If it can be for a moment attributed to the beneficent\r\ninfluence of slavery on their natures (and I think slaveowners are quite\r\nlikely to imagine so), it is curious enough that there is hardly any alloy\r\nwhatever of cringing servility, or even humility, in the good manners of\r\nthe blacks, but a rather courtly and affable condescension which, combined\r\nwith their affection for, and misapplication of, long words, produces an\r\nexceedingly comical effect. Old-house Molly, after congratulating herself,\r\nwith many thanks to heaven, for having spared her to see 'massa's' wife\r\nand children, drew forward her young companion, and informed me she was\r\none of her numerous grandchildren. The damsel, ycleped Louisa, made rather\r\na shame-faced obeisance, and her old grandmother went on to inform me that\r\nshe had only lately been forgiven by the overseer for an attempt to run\r\naway from the plantation. I enquired the cause of her desire to do so--a\r\n'thrashing' she had got for an unfinished task--'but lor, missis,'\r\nexplained the old woman, 'taint no use--what use nigger run away?--de\r\nswamp all round; dey get in dar, an dey starve to def, or de snakes eat em\r\nup--massa's nigger, dey don't neber run away;' and if the good lady's\r\naccount of their prospects in doing so is correct (which, substituting\r\nbiting for eating, on the part of the snakes, it undoubtedly is), one does\r\nnot see exactly what particular merit the institution of slavery as\r\npractised on Mr. ----'s plantation derives from the fact that his 'nigger\r\ndon't neber run away.'\r\n\r\nAfter dismissing Molly and her grand-daughter, I was about to re-enter the\r\nhouse, when I was stopped by Betty, head-man Frank's wife, who came with a\r\npetition that she might be baptised. As usual with all requests involving\r\nanything more than an immediate physical indulgence, I promised to refer\r\nthe matter to Mr. ----, but expressed some surprise that Betty, now by no\r\nmeans a young woman, should have postponed a ceremony which the religious\r\namong the slaves are apt to attach much importance to. She told me she\r\nhad more than once applied for this permission to Massa K---- (the former\r\noverseer), but had never been able to obtain it, but that now she thought\r\nshe would ask 'de missis.'[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Of this woman's life on the plantation, I subsequently\r\nlearned the following circumstances:--She was the wife of head-man Frank,\r\nthe most intelligent and trustworthy of Mr. ----'s slaves; the head\r\ndriver--second in command to the overseer, and indeed second to none\r\nduring the pestilential season, when the rice swamps cannot with impunity\r\nbe inhabited by any white man, and when, therefore, the whole force\r\nemployed in its cultivation on the island remains entirely under his\r\nauthority and control. His wife--a tidy, trim, intelligent woman, with a\r\npretty figure, but a decidedly negro face--was taken from him by the\r\noverseer left in charge of the plantation by the Messrs. ----, the\r\nall-efficient and all-satisfactory Mr. K----, and she had a son by him,\r\nwhose straight features and diluted colour, no less than his troublesome,\r\ndiscontented and insubmissive disposition, bear witness to his Yankee\r\ndescent. I do not know how long Mr. K----'s occupation of Frank's wife\r\ncontinued, or how the latter endured the wrong done to him. When I visited\r\nthe island, Betty was again living with her husband--a grave, sad,\r\nthoughtful-looking man, whose admirable moral and mental qualities were\r\nextolled to me by no worse a judge of such matters than Mr. K---- himself,\r\nduring the few days he spent with Mr. ----, while we were on the\r\nplantation. This outrage upon this man's rights was perfectly notorious\r\namong all the slaves; and his hopeful offspring, Renty, alluding very\r\nunmistakably to his superior birth on one occasion when he applied for\r\npermission to have a gun, observed that, though the people in general on\r\nthe plantation were not allowed firearms, he thought he might, _on\r\naccount of his colour_, and added that he thought Mr. K---- might have\r\nleft him his. This precious sample of the mode in which the vices of the\r\nwhites procure the intellectual progress of the blacks to their own\r\nendangerment, was, as you will easily believe, a significant chapter to me\r\nin the black history of oppression which is laid before my eyes in this\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon I received a visit from the wife of our neighbour Dr.\r\nT----. As usual, she exclaimed at my good fortune in having a white woman\r\nwith my children when she saw M----, and, as usual, went on to expatiate\r\non the utter impossibility of finding a trustworthy nurse anywhere in the\r\nSouth, to whom your children could be safely confided for a day or even an\r\nhour; as usual too, the causes of this unworthiness or incapacity for a\r\nconfidential servant's occupation were ignored, and the fact laid to the\r\nnatural defects of the negro race. I am sick and weary of this cruel and\r\nignorant folly. This afternoon I went out to refresh myself with a row on\r\nthe broad Altamaha and the conversation of my slave Jack, which is, I\r\nassure you, by no means devoid of interest of various kinds, pathetic and\r\nhumorous. I do not know that Jack's scientific information is the most\r\nvaluable in the world, and I sometimes marvel with perhaps unjust\r\nincredulity at the facts in natural history which he imparts to me; for\r\ninstance, to-day he told me as we rowed past certain mud islands, very\r\nlike children's mud puddings on a rather larger scale than usual, that\r\nthey were inaccessible, and that it would be quite impossible to land on\r\none of them even for the shortest time. Not understanding why people who\r\ndid not mind being up to their knees in mud should not land there if they\r\npleased, I demurred to his assertion, when he followed it up by assuring\r\nme that there were what he called sand-sinks under the mud, and that\r\nwhatever was placed on the surface would not only sink through the mud,\r\nbut also into a mysterious quicksand of unknown depth and extent below it.\r\nThis may be true, but sounds very strange, although I remember that the\r\nfrequent occurrence of large patches of quicksand was found to be one of\r\nthe principal impediments in the way of the canal speculators at\r\nBrunswick. I did not, however, hear that these sinks, as Jack called them,\r\nwere found below a thick stratum of heavy mud.\r\n\r\nIn remonstrating with him upon the want of decent cleanliness generally\r\namong the people, and citing to him one among the many evils resulting\r\nfrom it, the intolerable quantity of fleas in all the houses, he met me\r\nfull with another fact in natural history which, if it be fact and not\r\nfiction, certainly gave him the best of the argument: he declared, with\r\nthe utmost vehemence, that the sand of the pine woods on the mainland\r\nacross the river literally swarmed with fleas--that in the uninhabited\r\nplaces the sand itself was full of them, and that so far from being a\r\nresult of human habitation, they were found in less numbers round the\r\nnegro huts on the mainland than in the lonely woods around them.\r\n\r\nThe ploughing is at length fairly inaugurated, and there is a regular\r\njubilee among the negroes thereat. After discoursing fluently on the\r\nimprovements likely to result from the measure, Jack wound up by saying he\r\nhad been afraid it would not be tried on account of the greater scarcity,\r\nand consequently greater value, of horses over men in these parts--a\r\nmodest and slave-like conclusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I walked up to-day, _February 14th_, to see that land of\r\npromise the ploughed field: it did not look to me anything like as heavy\r\nsoil as the cold wet sour stiff clay I have seen turned up in some of the\r\nswampy fields round Lenox; and as for the cypress roots which were urged\r\nas so serious an impediment, they are not much more frequent, and\r\ncertainly not as resisting, as the granite knees and elbows that stick out\r\nthrough the scanty covering of the said clay, which mother earth allows\r\nherself as sole garment for her old bones in many a Berkshire patch of\r\ncorn. After my survey, as I walked home, I came upon a gang of lusty\r\nwomen, as the phrase is here for women in the family-way; they were\r\nengaged in burning stubble, and I was nearly choked while receiving the\r\nmultitudinous complaints and compliments with which they overwhelmed me.\r\nAfter leaving them, I wandered along the river side on the dyke homeward,\r\nrejoicing in the buds and green things putting forth their tender shoots\r\non every spray, in the early bees and even the less amiable wasps busy in\r\nthe sunshine with flowers--(weeds I suppose they should be called),\r\nalready opening their sweet temptations to them, and giving the earth a\r\nspring aspect, such as it does not wear with you in Massachusetts till\r\nlate in May.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I took my accustomed row: there had been a tremendous ebb\r\ntide, the consequence of which was to lay bare portions of the banks which\r\nI had not seen before. The cypress roots form a most extraordinary mass of\r\nintertwined wood-work, so closely matted and joined together, that the\r\nseparate roots, in spite of their individual peculiarities, appeared only\r\nlike divisions of a continuous body; they presented the appearance in\r\nseveral places of jagged pieces of splintered rock, with their huge teeth\r\npointing downward into the water. Their decay is so slow that the\r\nprotection they afford the soft spongy banks against the action of the\r\nwater, is likely to be prolonged until the gathering and deposit of\r\nsuccessive layers of alluvium will remove them from the margin of which\r\nthey are now most useful supports. On my return home, I was met by a child\r\n(as she seemed to me) carrying a baby, in whose behalf she begged me for\r\nsome clothes. On making some enquiry, I was amazed to find that the child\r\nwas her own: she said she was married and fourteen years old, she looked\r\nmuch younger even than that, poor creature. Her mother, who came up while\r\nI was talking to her, said she did not herself know the girl's age;--how\r\nhorridly brutish it all did seem, to be sure.\r\n\r\nThe spring is already here with her hands full of flowers. I do not know\r\nwho planted some straggling pyrus japonica near the house, but it is\r\nblessing my eyes with a hundred little flame-like buds, which will\r\npresently burst into a blaze; there are clumps of narcissus roots sending\r\nup sheaves of ivory blossoms, and I actually found a monthly rose in bloom\r\non the sunny side of one of the dykes; what a delight they are in the\r\nslovenly desolation of this abode of mine! what a garden one might have on\r\nthe banks of these dykes, with the least amount of trouble and care!\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I rowed over to Darien, and there procuring the most\r\nmiserable vehicle calling itself a carriage that I had ever seen (the\r\ndirtiest and shabbiest London hackney-coach were a chariot of splendour\r\nand ease to it), we drove some distance into the sandy wilderness that\r\nsurrounds the little town, to pay a visit to some of the resident gentry\r\nwho had called upon us. The road was a deep wearisome sandy track,\r\nstretching wearisomely into the wearisome pine forest--a species of\r\nwilderness more oppressive a thousand times to the senses and imagination\r\nthan any extent of monotonous prairie, barren steppe, or boundless desert\r\ncan be; for the horizon there at least invites and detains the eye,\r\nsuggesting beyond its limit possible change; the lights and shadows and\r\nenchanting colours of the sky afford some variety in their movement and\r\nchange, and the reflections of their tints; while in this hideous and\r\napparently boundless pine barren, you are deprived alike of horizon before\r\nyou and heaven above you: nor sun nor star appears through the thick\r\ncovert, which, in the shabby dinginess of its dark blue-green expanse,\r\nlooks like a gigantic cotton umbrella stretched immeasurably over you. It\r\nis true that over that sandy soil a dark green cotton umbrella is a very\r\nwelcome protection from the sun, and when the wind makes music in the tall\r\npine-tops and refreshment in the air beneath them. The comparison may seem\r\nungrateful enough: to-day, however, there was neither sound above nor\r\nmotion below, and the heat was perfectly stifling, as we ploughed our way\r\nthrough the resinous-smelling sand solitudes.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a thicket of exquisite evergreen shrubs broke the\r\nmonotonous lines of the countless pine shafts rising round us, and still\r\nmore welcome were the golden garlands of the exquisite wild jasmine,\r\nhanging, drooping, trailing, clinging, climbing through the dreary forest,\r\njoining to the warm aromatic smell of the fir trees a delicious fragrance\r\nas of acres of heliotrope in bloom. I wonder if this delightful creature\r\nis very difficult of cultivation out of its natural region; I never\r\nremember to have seen it, at least not in blossom, in any collection of\r\nplants in the Northern States or in Europe, where it certainly deserves an\r\nhonourable place for its grace, beauty, and fragrance.\r\n\r\nOn our drive we passed occasionally a tattered man or woman, whose yellow\r\nmud complexion, straight features, and singularly sinister countenance\r\nbespoke an entirely different race from the negro population in the midst\r\nof which they lived. These are the so-called pine-landers of Georgia, I\r\nsuppose the most degraded race of human beings claiming an Anglo-Saxon\r\norigin that can be found on the face of the earth,--filthy, lazy,\r\nignorant, brutal, proud, penniless savages, without one of the nobler\r\nattributes which have been found occasionally allied to the vices of\r\nsavage nature. They own no slaves, for they are almost without exception\r\nabjectly poor; they will not work, for that, as they conceive, would\r\nreduce them to an equality with the abhorred negroes; they squat, and\r\nsteal, and starve, on the outskirts of this lowest of all civilised\r\nsocieties, and their countenances bear witness to the squalor of their\r\ncondition and the utter degradation of their natures. To the crime of\r\nslavery, though they have no profitable part or lot in it, they are\r\nfiercely accessory, because it is the barrier that divides the black and\r\nwhite races, at the foot of which they lie wallowing in unspeakable\r\ndegradation, but immensely proud of the base freedom which still separates\r\nthem from the lash-driven tillers of the soil.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Of such is the white family so wonderfully described in Mrs.\r\nStowe's 'Dred'--whose only slave brings up the orphaned children of his\r\nmasters with such exquisitely grotesque and pathetic tenderness. From such\r\nthe conscription which has fed the Southern army in the deplorable civil\r\nconflict now raging in America has drawn its rank and file. Better 'food\r\nfor powder' the world could scarcely supply. Fierce and idle, with hardly\r\none of the necessities or amenities that belong to civilised existence,\r\nthey are hardy endurers of hardship, and reckless to a savage degree of\r\nthe value of life, whether their own or others. The soldier's pay,\r\nreceived or promised, exceeds in amount per month anything they ever\r\nearned before per year, and the war they wage is one that enlists all\r\ntheir proud and ferocious instincts. It is against the Yankees--the\r\nnorthern sons of free soil, free toil and intelligence, the hated\r\nabolitionists whose success would sweep away slavery and reduce the\r\nsouthern white men to work--no wonder they are ready to fight to the death\r\nagainst this detestable alternative, especially as they look to victory as\r\nthe certain promotion of the refuse of the 'poor white' population of the\r\nSouth, of which they are one and all members, to the coveted dignity of\r\nslaveholders.]\r\n\r\nThe house at which our call was paid was set down in the midst of the Pine\r\nBarren with half-obliterated roads and paths round it, suggesting that it\r\nmight be visited and was inhabited. It was large and not unhandsome,\r\nthough curiously dilapidated considering that people were actually living\r\nin it; certain remnants of carving on the cornices and paint on the panels\r\nbore witness to some former stage of existence less neglected and\r\ndeteriorated than the present. The old lady mistress of this most forlorn\r\nabode amiably enquired if so much exercise did not fatigue me; at first I\r\nthought she imagined I must have walked through the pine forest all the\r\nway from Darien, but she explained that she considered the drive quite an\r\neffort; and it is by no means uncommon to hear people in America talk of\r\nbeing dragged over bad roads in uneasy carriages as exercise, showing how\r\nvery little they know the meaning of the word, and how completely they\r\nidentify it with the idea of mere painful fatigue, instead of pleasurable\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nReturning home, my reflections ran much on the possible future destiny of\r\nthese vast tracts of sandy soil. It seems to me that the ground capable of\r\nsupporting the evergreen growth, the luxuriant gardenia bushes, the bay\r\nmyrtle, the beautiful magnolia grandiflora, and the powerful and gnarled\r\nlive oaks, that find their sustenance in this earth and under this same\r\nsky as the fir trees, must be convertible into a prosperous habitation for\r\nother valuable vegetable growth that would add immensely to the wealth of\r\nthe Southern States. The orange thrives and bears profusely along this\r\npart of the sea-board of Georgia; and I cannot conceive that the olive,\r\nthe mulberry, and the vine might not be acclimated and successfully and\r\nprofitably cultivated throughout the whole of this region, the swampy\r\nlower lands alone remaining as rice plantations. The produce of these\r\nalready exceeds in value that of the once gold-growing cotton-fields, and\r\nI cannot help believing that silk and wine and oil may, and will,\r\nhereafter, become, with the present solitary cotton crop, joint possessors\r\nof all this now but half-reclaimed wilderness. The soil all round Sorrento\r\nis very nearly as light and dry and sandy as this, and vineyards and olive\r\norchards and cocooneries are part of the agricultural wealth there. Our\r\nneighbour Mr. C---- has successfully cultivated the date-palm in his\r\ngarden on the edge of the sea, at St. Simon's, and certainly the ilex,\r\norange, and myrtle abounding here suggest natural affinities between the\r\nItalian soil and climate and this.\r\n\r\nI must tell you something funny which occurred yesterday at dinner, which\r\nwill give you some idea of the strange mode in which we live. We have now\r\nnot unfrequently had mutton at table, the flavour of which is quite\r\nexcellent, as indeed it well may be, for it is raised under all the\r\nconditions of the famous _Pré salé_ that the French gourmands especially\r\nprize, and which are reproduced on our side of the channel in the peculiar\r\nqualities of our best South Down. The mutton we have here grazes on the\r\nshort sweet grass at St. Simon's within sea-salt influence, and is some of\r\nthe very best I have ever tasted, but it is invariably brought to table in\r\nlumps or chunks of no particular shape or size, and in which it is utterly\r\nimpossible to recognise any part of the quadruped creature sheep with\r\nwhich my eyes have hitherto become acquainted. Eat it, one may and does\r\nthankfully; name it, one could not by any possibility. Having submitted to\r\nthis for some time, I at length enquired why a decent usual Christian\r\njoint of mutton--leg, shoulder, or saddle--was never brought to table: the\r\nreply was that the _carpenter_ always cut up the meat, and that he did not\r\nknow how to do it otherwise than by dividing it into so many thick square\r\npieces, and proceeding to chop it up on that principle; and the\r\nconsequence of this is that _four lumps_ or _chunks_ are all that a whole\r\nsheep ever furnishes to our table by this artistic and economical process.\r\n\r\nThis morning I have been to the hospital to see a poor woman who has just\r\nenriched Mr. ---- by _borning_ him another slave. The poor little\r\npiccaninny, as they called it, was not one bit uglier than white babies\r\nunder similarly novel circumstances, except in one particular, that it had\r\na head of hair like a trunk, in spite of which I had all the pains in the\r\nworld in persuading its mother not to put a cap upon it. I bribed her\r\nfinally, by the promise of a pair of socks instead, with which I undertook\r\nto endow her child, and, moreover, actually prevailed upon her to forego\r\nthe usual swaddling and swathing process, and let her poor baby be dressed\r\nat its first entrance into life as I assured her both mine had been.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the hospital I visited the huts all along the street,\r\nconfiscating sundry refractory baby caps among shrieks and outcries,\r\npartly of laughter and partly of real ignorant alarm for the consequence.\r\nI think if this infatuation for hot head-dresses continues, I shall make\r\nshaving the children's heads the only condition upon which they shall be\r\nallowed to wear caps.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning I went over to Darien to church. Our people's church was\r\nclosed, the minister having gone to officiate elsewhere. With laudable\r\nliberality I walked into the opposite church of a different, not to say\r\nopposite sect: here I heard a sermon, the opening of which will,\r\nprobably, edify you as it did me, viz., that if a man was _just in all his\r\ndealings_ he was apt to think he did all that could be required of\r\nhim,--and no wide mistake either one might suppose. But is it not\r\nwonderful how such words can be spoken here, with the most absolute\r\nunconsciousness of their tremendous bearing upon the existence of every\r\nslaveholder who hears them? Certainly the use that is second nature has\r\nmade the awful injustice in the daily practice of which these people live,\r\na thing of which they are as little aware as you or I of the atmospheric\r\nair that we inhale each time we breathe. The bulk of the congregation in\r\nthis church was white. The negroes are, of course, not allowed to mix with\r\ntheir masters in the house of God, and there is no special place set apart\r\nfor them. Occasionally one or two are to be seen in the corners of the\r\nsinging gallery, but any more open pollution by them of their owners'\r\nchurch could not be tolerated. Mr. ----'s people have petitioned very\r\nvehemently that he would build a church for them on the island. I doubt,\r\nhowever, his allowing them such a luxury as a place of worship all to\r\nthemselves. Such a privilege might not be well thought of by the\r\nneighbouring planters; indeed, it is almost what one might call a\r\nwhity-brown idea, dangerous, demoralising, inflammatory, incendiary. I\r\nshould not wonder if I should be suspected of being the chief corner-stone\r\nof it, and yet I am not: it is an old hope and entreaty of these poor\r\npeople, which am afraid they are not destined to see fulfilled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. Passing the rice-mill this morning in my walk, I went in to\r\nlook at the machinery, the large steam mortars which shell the rice, and\r\nwhich work under the intelligent and reliable supervision of Engineer Ned.\r\nI was much surprised, in the course of conversation with him this morning,\r\nto find how much older a man he was than he appeared. Indeed his youthful\r\nappearance had hitherto puzzled me much in accounting for his very\r\nsuperior intelligence and the important duties confided to him. He is,\r\nhowever, a man upwards of forty years old, although he looks ten years\r\nyounger. He attributed his own uncommonly youthful appearance to the fact\r\nof his never having done what he called field work, or been exposed, as\r\nthe common gang negroes are, to the hardships of their all but brutish\r\nexistence. He said his former master had brought him up very kindly, and\r\nhe had learnt to tend the engines, and had never been put to any other\r\nwork, but he said this was not the case with his poor wife. He wished she\r\nwas as well off as he was, but she had to work in the rice-fields and was\r\n'most broke in two' with labour and exposure and hard work while with\r\nchild, and hard work just directly after child-bearing; he said she could\r\nhardly crawl, and he urged me very much to speak a kind word for her to\r\nmassa. She was almost all the time in hospital, and he thought she could\r\nnot live long.\r\n\r\nNow, E----, here is another instance of the horrible injustice of this\r\nsystem of slavery. In my country or in yours, a man endowed with\r\nsufficient knowledge and capacity to be an engineer would, of course, be\r\nin the receipt of considerable wages; his wife would, together with\r\nhimself, reap the advantages of his ability, and share the well-being his\r\nlabour earned; he would be able to procure for her comfort in sickness or\r\nin health, and beyond the necessary household work, which the wives of\r\nmost artisans are inured to, she would have no labour to encounter; in\r\ncase of sickness even these would be alleviated by the assistance of some\r\nstout girl of all work, or kindly neighbour, and the tidy parlour or snug\r\nbed-room would be her retreat if unequal to the daily duties of her own\r\nkitchen. Think of such a lot compared with that of the head engineer of\r\nMr. ----'s plantation, whose sole wages are his coarse food and raiment\r\nand miserable hovel, and whose wife, covered with one filthy garment of\r\nragged texture and dingy colour, bare-footed and bare-headed, is daily\r\ndriven a-field to labour with aching pain-racked joints, under the lash of\r\na driver, or lies languishing on the earthen floor of the dismal\r\nplantation hospital in a condition of utter physical destitution and\r\ndegradation such as the most miserable dwelling of the poorest inhabitant\r\nof your free Northern villages never beheld the like of. Think of the\r\nrows of tidy tiny houses in the long suburbs of Boston and Philadelphia,\r\ninhabited by artisans of just the same grade as this poor Ned, with their\r\nwhite doors and steps, their hydrants of inexhaustible fresh flowing\r\nwater, the innumerable appliances for decent comfort of their cheerful\r\nrooms, the gay wardrobe of the wife, her cotton prints for daily use, her\r\nsilk for Sunday church-going; the careful comfort of the children's\r\nclothing, the books and newspapers in the little parlour, the daily\r\ndistrict school, the weekly parish church: imagine if you can--but you are\r\nhappy that you cannot--the contrast between such an existence and that of\r\nthe best mechanic on a Southern plantation.\r\n\r\nDid you ever read (but I am sure you never did, and no more did I), an\r\nepic poem on fresh-water fish? Well, such a one was once written, I have\r\nforgotten by whom, but assuredly the heroine of it ought to have been the\r\nAltamaha shad--a delicate creature, so superior to the animal you\r\nnortherners devour with greedy thankfulness when the spring sends back\r\ntheir finny drove to your colder waters, that one would not suppose these\r\nwere of the same family, instead of being, as they really are, precisely\r\nthe same fish. Certainly the mud of the Altamaha must have some most\r\npeculiar virtues; and, by the by, I have never anywhere tasted such\r\ndelicious tea as that which we make with this same turbid stream, the\r\nwater of which duly filtered, of course, has some peculiar softness which\r\naffects the tea (and it is the same we always use) in a most curious and\r\nagreeable manner.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the house I found a terrible disturbance in consequence of\r\nthe disappearance from under cook John's safe keeping, of a ham Mr. -----\r\nhad committed to his charge. There was no doubt whatever that the\r\nunfortunate culinary slave had made away in some inscrutable manner with\r\nthe joint intended for our table: the very lies he told about it were so\r\ncuriously shallow, child-like, and transparent, that while they confirmed\r\nthe fact of his theft quite as much if not more than an absolute\r\nconfession would have done, they provoked at once my pity and my\r\nirrepressible mirth to a most painful degree. Mr. ---- was in a state of\r\ntowering anger and indignation, and besides a flogging sentenced the\r\nunhappy cook to degradation from his high and dignified position (and,\r\nalas! all its sweets of comparatively easy labour and good living from the\r\nremains of our table) to the hard toil, coarse scanty fare, and despised\r\nposition of a common field hand. I suppose some punishment was inevitably\r\nnecessary in such a plain case of deliberate theft as this, but,\r\nnevertheless, my whole soul revolts at the injustice of visiting upon\r\nthese poor wretches a moral darkness which all possible means are taken to\r\nincrease and perpetuate.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this and the whole circumstance of John's trespass to\r\nMr. ---- in the evening, I observed that the ignorance of these poor\r\npeople ought to screen them from punishment. He replied, that they knew\r\nwell enough what was right and wrong. I asked how they could be expected\r\nto know it? He replied, by the means of Cooper London, and the religious\r\ninstruction he gave them. So that, after all, the appeal is to be made\r\nagainst themselves to that moral and religious instruction which is\r\nwithheld from them, and which, if they obtain it at all, is the result of\r\ntheir own unaided and unencouraged exertion. The more I hear, and see,\r\nand learn, and ponder the whole of this system of slavery, the more\r\nimpossible I find it to conceive how its practisers and upholders are to\r\njustify their deeds before the tribunal of their own conscience or God's\r\nlaw. It is too dreadful to have those whom we love accomplices to this\r\nwickedness; it is too intolerable to find myself an involuntary\r\naccomplice to it.\r\n\r\nI had a conversation the next morning with Abraham, cook John's brother,\r\nupon the subject of his brother's theft; and only think of the _slave_\r\nsaying that 'this action had brought disgrace upon the family.' Does not\r\nthat sound very like the very best sort of free pride, the pride of\r\ncharacter, the honourable pride of honesty, integrity, and fidelity? But\r\nthis was not all, for this same Abraham, a clever carpenter and much\r\nvalued _hand_ on the estate, went on, in answer to my questions, to tell\r\nme such a story that I declare to you I felt as if I could have howled\r\nwith helpless indignation and grief when he departed and went to resume\r\nhis work. His grandfather had been an old slave in Darien, extremely\r\nclever as a carpenter, and so highly valued for his skill and good\r\ncharacter that his master allowed him to purchase his liberty by money\r\nwhich he earned by working for himself at odd times, when his task work\r\nwas over. I asked Abraham what sum his grandfather paid for his freedom:\r\nhe said he did not know, but he supposed a large one, because of his being\r\na 'skilled carpenter,' and so a peculiarly valuable chattel. I presume,\r\nfrom what I remember Major M---- and Dr. H---- saying on the subject of\r\nthe market value of negroes in Charleston and Savannah, that such a man in\r\nthe prime of life would have been worth from 1,500 to 2,000 dollars.\r\nHowever, whatever the man paid for his ransom, by his grandson's account,\r\nfourteen years after he became free, when he died, he had again amassed\r\nmoney to the amount of 700 dollars, which he left among his wife and\r\nchildren, the former being a slave on Major ----'s estate, where the\r\nlatter remained by virtue of that fact slaves also. So this man not only\r\nbought his own freedom at a cost of _at least_ 1,000 dollars, but left a\r\nlittle fortune of 700 more at his death: and then we are told of the\r\nuniversal idleness, thriftlessness, incorrigible sloth, and brutish\r\nincapacity of this inferior race of creatures, whose only fitting and\r\nHeaven-appointed condition is that of beasts of burthen to the whites. I\r\ndo not believe the whole low white population of the state of Georgia\r\ncould furnish such an instance of energy, industry, and thrift, as the\r\namassing of this laborious little fortune by this poor slave, who left,\r\nnevertheless, his children and grandchildren to the lot from which he had\r\nso heroically ransomed himself: and yet the white men with whom I live and\r\ntalk tell me, day after day, that there is neither cruelty nor injustice\r\nin this accursed system.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past five I went to walk on the dykes, and met a gang of the\r\nfield-hands going to the tide-mill, as the water served them for working\r\nthen. I believe I have told you that besides the great steam mill there is\r\nthis, which is dependent on the rise and fall of the tide in the river,\r\nand where the people are therefore obliged to work by day or night at\r\nwhatever time the water serves to impel the wheel. They greeted me with\r\ntheir usual profusion of exclamations, petitions, and benedictions, and I\r\nparted from them to come and oversee my slave Jack, for whom I had bought\r\na spade, and to whom I had entrusted the task of turning up some ground\r\nfor me, in which I wanted to establish some of the Narcissus and other\r\nflowers I had remarked about the ground and the house. Jack, however, was\r\na worse digger than Adam could have been when first he turned his hand to\r\nit, after his expulsion from Paradise. I think I could have managed a\r\nspade with infinitely more efficiency, or rather less incapacity, than he\r\ndisplayed. Upon my expressing my amazement at his performance, he said\r\nthe people here never used spades, but performed all their agricultural\r\noperations with the hoe. Their soil must be very light and their\r\nagriculture very superficial, I should think. However, I was obliged to\r\nterminate Jack's spooning process and abandon, for the present, my hopes\r\nof a flower-bed created by his industry, being called into the house to\r\nreceive the return visit of old Mrs. S----. As usual, the appearance,\r\nhealth, vigour, and good management of the children were the theme of\r\nwondering admiration; as usual, my possession of a white nurse the theme\r\nof envious congratulation; as usual, I had to hear the habitual senseless\r\ncomplaints of the inefficiency of coloured nurses. If you are half as\r\ntired of the sameness and stupidity of the conversation of my southern\r\nfemale neighbours as I am, I pity you; but not as much as I pity them for\r\nthe stupid sameness of their most vapid existence, which would deaden any\r\namount of intelligence, obliterate any amount of instruction, and render\r\ntorpid and stagnant any amount of natural energy and vivacity. I would\r\nrather die--rather a thousand times--than live the lives of these Georgia\r\nplanters' wives and daughters.\r\n\r\nMrs. S---- had brought me some of the delicious wild jasmine that festoons\r\nher dreary pine-wood drive, and most grateful I was for the presence of\r\nthe sweet wild nosegay in my highly unornamental residence. When my\r\nvisitors had left me, I took the refreshment of a row over to Darien; and\r\nas we had the tide against us coming back, the process was not so\r\nrefreshing for the rowers. The evening was so extremely beautiful, and the\r\nrising of the moon so exquisite, that instead of retreating to the house\r\nwhen I reached the island, I got into the Dolphin, my special canoe, and\r\nmade Jack paddle me down the great river to meet the Lily, which was\r\ncoming back from St. Simon's with Mr. ---- who has been preparing all\r\nthings for our advent thither.\r\n\r\nMy letter has been interrupted, dear E----, by the breaking up of our\r\nresidence on the rice plantation, and our arrival at St. Simon's, whence I\r\nnow address you. We came down yesterday afternoon, and I was thankful\r\nenough of the fifteen miles' row to rest in, from the labour of\r\nleave-taking, with which the whole morning was taken up, and which,\r\ncombined with packing and preparing all our own personalities and those of\r\nthe children, was no sinecure. At every moment one or other of the poor\r\npeople rushed in upon me to bid me good-bye; many of their farewells were\r\ngrotesque enough, some were pathetic, and all of them made me very sad.\r\nPoor people! how little I have done, how little I can do for them. I had a\r\nlong talk with that interesting and excellent man, Cooper London, who made\r\nan earnest petition that I would send him from the North a lot of Bibles\r\nand Prayer Books; certainly the science of reading must be much more\r\ncommon among the negroes than I supposed, or London must look to a\r\nmarvellously increased spread of the same hereafter. There is, however,\r\nconsiderable reticence upon this point, or else the poor slaves must\r\nconsider the mere possession of the holy books as good for salvation and\r\nas effectual for spiritual assistance to those who cannot as to those who\r\ncan comprehend them. Since the news of our departure has spread, I have\r\nhad repeated eager entreaties for presents of Bibles and Prayer Books, and\r\nto my demurrer of 'But you can't read; can you?' have generally received\r\nfor answer a reluctant acknowledgement of ignorance, which, however, did\r\nnot always convince me of the fact. In my farewell conversation with\r\nLondon I found it impossible to get him to tell me how he had learned to\r\nread: the penalties for teaching them are very severe, heavy fines,\r\nincreasing in amount for the first and second offence, and imprisonment\r\nfor the third.[4] Such a man as London is certainly aware that to teach\r\nthe slaves to read is an illegal act, and he may have been unwilling to\r\nbetray whoever had been his preceptor even to my knowledge; at any rate, I\r\ngot no answers from him but 'Well, missis, me learn; well, missis, me\r\ntry,' and finally, 'Well, missis, me 'spose Heaven help me;' to which I\r\ncould only reply, that I knew Heaven was helpful, but very hardly to the\r\ntune of teaching folks their letters. I got no satisfaction. Old Jacob,\r\nthe father of Abraham, cook John, and poor Psyche's husband, took a most\r\nsolemn and sad leave of me, saying he did not expect ever to see me again.\r\nI could not exactly tell why, because, though he is aged and infirm, the\r\nfifteen miles between the rice plantation and St. Simon's do not appear so\r\ninsuperable a barrier between the inhabitants of the two places, which I\r\nrepresented to him as a suggestion of consolation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: These laws have been greatly increased in stringency and\r\nseverity since these letters were written, and _death_ has not been\r\nreckoned too heavy a penalty for those who should venture to offer these\r\nunfortunate people the fruit of that forbidden tree of knowledge, their\r\naccess to which has appeared to their owners the crowning danger of their\r\nown precarious existence among their terrible dependents.]\r\n\r\nI have worked my fingers nearly off with making, for the last day or two,\r\ninnumerable rolls of coarse little baby clothes, layettes for the use of\r\nsmall new-born slaves; M---- diligently cutting and shaping, and I as\r\ndiligently stitching. We leave a good supply for the hospitals, and for\r\nthe individual clients besides who have besieged me ever since my\r\ndeparture became imminent.\r\n\r\nOur voyage from the rice to the cotton plantation was performed in the\r\nLily, which looked like a soldier's baggage wagon and an emigrant\r\ntransport combined. Our crew consisted of eight men. Forward in the bow\r\nwere miscellaneous live stock, pots, pans, household furniture, kitchen\r\nutensils, and an indescribable variety of heterogeneous necessaries.\r\nEnthroned upon beds, bedding, tables, and other chattels, sat that poor\r\npretty chattel Psyche, with her small chattel children. Midships sat the\r\ntwo tiny free women, and myself, and in the stern Mr. ---- steering. And\r\n'all in the blue unclouded weather' we rowed down the huge stream, the men\r\nkeeping time and tune to their oars with extemporaneous chaunts of adieu\r\nto the rice island and its denizens. Among other poetical and musical\r\ncomments on our departure recurred the assertion, as a sort of burthen,\r\nthat we were 'parted in body, but not in mind,' from those we left behind.\r\nHaving relieved one set of sentiments by this reflection, they very wisely\r\nbetook themselves to the consideration of the blessings that remained to\r\nthem, and performed a spirited chaunt in honour of Psyche and our bouncing\r\nblack housemaid, Mary.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fifteen miles' row we entered one among a perfect\r\nlabyrinth of arms or branches, into which the broad river ravels like a\r\nfringe as it reaches the sea, a dismal navigation along a dismal tract,\r\ncalled 'Five Pound,' through a narrow cut or channel of water divided from\r\nthe main stream. The conch was sounded, as at our arrival at the rice\r\nisland, and we made our descent on the famous long staple cotton island of\r\nSt. Simon's, where we presently took up our abode in what had all the\r\nappearance of an old half-decayed rattling farm-house.\r\n\r\nThis morning, Sunday, I peeped round its immediate neighbourhood, and saw,\r\nto my inexpressible delight, within hail, some noble-looking evergreen\r\noaks, and close to the house itself a tiny would-be garden, a plot of\r\nground with one or two peach-trees in full blossom, tufts of silver\r\nnarcissus and jonquils, a quantity of violets and an exquisite myrtle\r\nbush; wherefore I said my prayers with especial gratitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. The fame of my peculiar requisitions has, I find, preceded\r\nme here, for the babies that have been presented to my admiring notice\r\nhave all been without caps; also, however, without socks to their opposite\r\nlittle wretched extremities, but that does not signify quite so much. The\r\npeople, too, that I saw yesterday were remarkably clean and tidy; to be\r\nsure, it was Sunday. The whole day, till quite late in the afternoon, the\r\nhouse was surrounded by a crowd of our poor dependents, waiting to catch a\r\nglimpse of Mr. ----, myself, or the children; and until, from sheer\r\nweariness, I was obliged to shut the doors, an incessant stream poured in\r\nand out, whose various modes of salutation, greeting, and welcome were\r\nmore grotesque and pathetic at the same time than anything you can\r\nimagine. In the afternoon I walked with ---- to see a new house in process\r\nof erection, which, when it is finished, is to be the overseer's abode and\r\nour residence during any future visits we may pay to the estate. I was\r\nhorrified at the dismal site selected, and the hideous house erected on\r\nit. It is true that the central position is the principal consideration in\r\nthe overseer's location, but both position and building seemed to me to\r\nwitness to an inveterate love of ugliness, or at any rate a deadness to\r\nevery desire of beauty, nothing short of horrible; and for my own part, I\r\nthink it is intolerable to have to leave the point where the waters meet,\r\nand where a few fine picturesque old trees are scattered about, to come to\r\nthis place even for the very short time I am ever likely to spend here.\r\n\r\nIn every direction our view, as we returned, was bounded by thickets of\r\nthe most beautiful and various evergreen growth, which beckoned my\r\ninexperience most irresistibly. ---- said, to my unutterable horror, that\r\nthey were perfectly infested with rattlesnakes, and I must on no account\r\ngo 'beating about the bush' in these latitudes, as the game I should be\r\nlikely to start would be anything but agreeable to me. We saw quantities\r\nof wild plum-trees all silvery with blossoms, and in lovely companionship\r\nand contrast with them a beautiful shrub covered with delicate pink bloom\r\nlike flowering peach-trees. After that life in the rice-swamp, where the\r\nAltamaha kept looking over the dyke at me all the time as I sat in the\r\nhouse writing or working, it is pleasant to be on _terra firma_ again, and\r\nto know that the river is at the conventional, not to say natural, depth\r\nbelow its banks, and under my feet instead of over my head. The two\r\nplantations are of diametrically opposite dispositions--that is all swamp,\r\nand this all sand; or to speak more accurately, that is all swamp, and\r\nall of this that is not swamp, is sand.\r\n\r\nOn our way home we met a most extraordinary creature of the negro kind,\r\nwho, coming towards us, halted, and caused us to halt straight in the\r\nmiddle of the path, when bending himself down till his hands almost\r\ntouched the ground, he exclaimed to Mr. ----, 'Massa ----, your most\r\nobedient;' and then, with a kick and a flourish altogether indescribable,\r\nhe drew to the side of the path to let us pass, which we did perfectly\r\nshouting with laughter, which broke out again every time we looked at each\r\nother and stopped to take breath--so sudden, grotesque, uncouth, and yet\r\ndexterous a gambado never came into the brain or out of the limbs of\r\nanything but a 'niggar.'\r\n\r\nI observed, among the numerous groups that we passed or met, a much larger\r\nproportion of mulattoes than at the rice-island; upon asking Mr. ---- why\r\nthis was so, he said that there no white person could land without his or\r\nthe overseer's permission, whereas on St. Simon's, which is a large island\r\ncontaining several plantations belonging to different owners, of course\r\nthe number of whites, both residing on and visiting the place, was much\r\ngreater, and the opportunity for intercourse between the blacks and whites\r\nmuch more frequent. While we were still on this subject, a horrid-looking\r\nfilthy woman met us with a little child in her arms, a very light mulatto,\r\nwhose extraordinary resemblance to Driver Bran (one of the officials, who\r\nhad been duly presented to me on my arrival, and who was himself a\r\nmulatto) struck me directly. I pointed it out to Mr. ----, who merely\r\nanswered, 'Very likely his child.' 'And,' said I, 'did you never remark\r\nthat Driver Bran is the exact image of Mr. K----?' 'Very likely his\r\nbrother,' was the reply: all which rather unpleasant state of\r\nrelationships seemed accepted as such a complete matter of course, that I\r\nfelt rather uncomfortable, and said no more about who was like who, but\r\ncame to certain conclusions in my own mind as to a young lad who had been\r\namong our morning visitors, and whose extremely light colour and straight\r\nhandsome features and striking resemblance to Mr. K----, had suggested\r\nsuspicions of a rather unpleasant nature to me, and whose\r\nsole-acknowledged parent was a very black negress of the name of Minda. I\r\nhave no doubt at all, now, that he is another son of Mr. K----, Mr. ----'s\r\nparagon overseer.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the house again we were gradually joined by such a\r\nnumerous escort of Mr. ----'s slaves that it was almost with difficulty we\r\ncould walk along the path. They buzzed, and hummed, and swarmed round us\r\nlike flies, and the heat and dust consequent upon this friendly\r\ncompanionship were a most unpleasant addition to the labour of walking in\r\nthe sandy soil through which we were ploughing. I was not sorry when we\r\nentered the house and left our bodyguard outside. In the evening I looked\r\nover the plan of the delightful residence I had visited in the morning,\r\nand could not help suggesting to Mr. ---- the advantage to be gained in\r\npoint of picturesqueness by merely turning the house round. It is but a\r\nwooden frame one after all, and your folks 'down east' would think no more\r\nof inviting it to face about than if it was built of cards; but the fact\r\nis, here nothing signifies except the cotton crop, and whether one's nose\r\nis in a swamp and one's eyes in a sand-heap, is of no consequence whatever\r\neither to oneself (if oneself was not I) or anyone else.\r\n\r\nI find here an immense proportion of old people; the work and the climate\r\nof the rice plantation require the strongest of the able-bodied men and\r\nwomen of the estate. The cotton crop is no longer by any means as\r\nparamount in value as it used to be, and the climate, soil, and labour of\r\nSt. Simon's are better adapted to old, young, and feeble cultivators,\r\nthan the swamp fields of the rice-island. I wonder if I ever told you of\r\nthe enormous decrease in value of this same famous sea-island long staple\r\ncotton. When Major ----, Mr. ----'s grandfather, first sent the produce\r\nof this plantation where we now are to England, it was of so fine a\r\nquality that it used to be quoted by itself in the Liverpool cotton\r\nmarket, and was then worth half a guinea a pound; it is now not worth a\r\nshilling a pound. This was told me by the gentleman in Liverpool who has\r\nbeen factor for this estate for thirty years. Such a decrease as this in\r\nthe value of one's crop and the steady increase at the same time of a\r\nslave population, now numbering between 700 and 800 bodies to clothe and\r\nhouse,--mouths to feed, while the land is being exhausted by the careless\r\nand wasteful nature of the agriculture itself, suggests a pretty serious\r\nprospect of declining prosperity; and, indeed, unless these Georgia\r\ncotton planters can command more land or lay abundant capital (which they\r\nhave not, being almost all of them over head and ears in debt) upon that\r\nwhich has already spent its virgin vigour, it is a very obvious thing\r\nthat they must all very soon be eaten up by their own property. The rice\r\nplantations are a great thing to fall back upon under these\r\ncircumstances, and the rice crop is now quite as valuable, if not more\r\nso, than the cotton one on Mr. ----'s estates, once so famous and\r\nprosperous through the latter.\r\n\r\nI find any number of all but superannuated men and women here, whose\r\ntales of the former grandeur of the estate and family are like things one\r\nreads of in novels. One old woman who crawled to see me, and could hardly\r\nlift her poor bowed head high enough to look in my face, had been in\r\nMajor ----'s establishment in Philadelphia, and told with infinite pride\r\nof having waited upon his daughters and grand-daughters, Mr. ----'s\r\nsisters. Yet here she is, flung by like an old rag, crippled with age and\r\ndisease, living, or rather dying by slow degrees in a miserable hovel,\r\nsuch as no decent household servant would at the North, I suppose, ever\r\nset their foot in. The poor old creature complained bitterly to me of all\r\nher ailments and all her wants. I can do little, alas! for either. I had\r\na visit from another tottering old crone called Dorcas, who all but went\r\non her knees as she wrung and kissed my hands; with her came my friend\r\nMolly, the grandmother of the poor runaway girl, Louisa, whose story I\r\nwrote you some little time ago. I had to hear it all over again, it being\r\nthe newest event evidently in Molly's life; and it ended as before with\r\nthe highly reasonable proposition: 'Me say, missis, what for massa's\r\nniggar run away? Snake eat em up, or dey starve to def in a swamp.\r\nMassa's niggars dey don't nebbar run away.' If I was 'massa's niggars,' I\r\n'spose' I shouldn't run away either, with only those alternatives, but\r\nwhen I look at these wretches and at the sea that rolls round this\r\nisland, and think how near the English West Indies and freedom are, it\r\ngives me a pretty severe twinge at the heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I am afraid my letters must be becoming very wearisome to\r\nyou, for if, as the copy-book runs, 'variety is charming,' they certainly\r\ncannot be so, unless monotony is also charming, a thing not impossible to\r\nsome minds, but of which the copy-book makes no mention. But what will\r\nyou? as the French say; my days are no more different from one another\r\nthan peas in a dish, or sands on the shore: 'tis a pleasant enough life to\r\nlive, for one who, like myself, has a passion for dulness, but it affords\r\nsmall matter for epistolary correspondence. I suppose it is the surfeit of\r\nexcitement that I had in my youth that has made a life of quiet monotony\r\nso extremely agreeable to me; it is like stillness after loud noise,\r\ntwilight after glare, rest after labour. There is enough strangeness too\r\nin everything that surrounds me here to interest and excite me agreeably\r\nand sufficiently, and I should like the wild savage loneliness of the far\r\naway existence extremely, if it were not for the one small item of 'the\r\nslavery.'\r\n\r\nI had a curious visit this morning from half a dozen of the women, among\r\nwhom were Driver Morris's wife and Venus (a hideous old goddess she was,\r\nto be sure), Driver Bran's mother. They came especially to see the\r\nchildren, who are always eagerly asked for, and hugely admired by their\r\nsooty dependents. These poor women went into ecstasies over the little\r\nwhite piccaninnies, and were loud and profuse in their expressions of\r\ngratitude to massa ---- for getting married and having children, a matter\r\nof thankfulness which, though it always makes me laugh very much, is a\r\nmost serious one to them; for the continuance of the family keeps the\r\nestate and slaves from the hammer, and the poor wretches, besides seeing\r\nin every new child born to their owners a security against their own\r\nbanishment from the only home they know, and separation from all ties of\r\nkindred and habit, and dispersion to distant plantations, not unnaturally\r\nlook for a milder rule from masters who are the children of their fathers'\r\nmasters. The relation of owner and slave may be expected to lose some of\r\nits harsher features, and, no doubt, in some instances, does so, when it\r\nis on each side the inheritance of successive generations. And so ----'s\r\nslaves laud, and applaud, and thank, and bless him for having married, and\r\nendowed their children with two little future mistresses. One of these\r\nwomen, a Diana by name, went down on her knees and uttered in a loud voice\r\na sort of extemporaneous prayer of thanksgiving at our advent, in which\r\nthe sacred and the profane were most ludicrously mingled; her 'tanks to de\r\ngood Lord God Almighty that missus had come, what give de poor niggar\r\nsugar and flannel,' and dat 'massa ----, him hab brought de missis and de\r\ntwo little misses down among de people,' were really too grotesque; and\r\nyet certainly more sincere acts of thanksgiving are not often uttered\r\namong the solemn and decorous ones that are offered up to heaven for\r\n'benefits received.'\r\n\r\nI find the people here much more inclined to talk than those on the\r\nrice-island; they have less to do and more leisure, and bestow it very\r\nliberally on me; moreover, the poor old women, of whom there are so many\r\nturned out to grass here, and of whom I have spoken to you before,\r\nthough they are past work, are by no means past gossip, and the stories\r\nthey have to tell of the former government of the estate under old Massa\r\nK---- are certainly pretty tremendous illustrations of the merits of\r\nslavery as a moral institution. This man, the father of the late owner,\r\nMr. R---- K----, was Major ----'s agent in the management of this\r\nproperty; and a more cruel and unscrupulous one as regards the slaves\r\nthemselves, whatever he may have been in his dealings with the master, I\r\nshould think it would be difficult to find, even among the cruel and\r\nunscrupulous class to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with old 'House Molly,' as she is called, to distinguish\r\nher from all other Mollies on the estate, she having had the honour of\r\nbeing a servant in Major ----'s house for many years, I asked her if the\r\nrelation between men and women who are what they call married, i.e., who\r\nhave agreed to live together as man and wife (the only species of marriage\r\nformerly allowed on the estate, I believe now London may read the Marriage\r\nService to them), was considered binding by the people themselves and by\r\nthe overseer. She said 'not much, formerly,' and that the people couldn't\r\nbe expected to have much regard to such an engagement, utterly ignored as\r\nit was by Mr. K----, whose invariable rule, if he heard of any\r\ndisagreement between a man and woman calling themselves married, was\r\nimmediately to bestow them in 'marriage' on other parties, whether they\r\nchose it or not, by which summary process the slightest 'incompatibility\r\nof temper' received the relief of a divorce more rapid and easy than even\r\nGermany could afford, and the estate lost nothing by any prolongation of\r\ncelibacy on either side. Of course, the misery consequent upon such\r\narbitrary destruction of voluntary and imposition of involuntary ties was\r\nnothing to Mr. K----.\r\n\r\nI was very sorry to hear to-day, that Mr. O----, the overseer at the\r\nrice-island, of whom I have made mention to you more than once in my\r\nletters, had had one of the men flogged very severely for getting his wife\r\nbaptised. I was quite unable, from the account I received, to understand\r\nwhat his objection had been to the poor man's desire to make his wife at\r\nleast a formal Christian; but it does seem dreadful that such an act\r\nshould be so visited. I almost wish I was back again at the rice-island;\r\nfor though this is every way the pleasanter residence, I hear so much more\r\nthat is intolerable of the treatment of the slaves from those I find here,\r\nthat my life is really made wretched by it. There is not a single natural\r\nright that is not taken away from these unfortunate people, and the worst\r\nof all is, that their condition does not appear to me, upon further\r\nobservation of it, to be susceptible of even partial alleviation as long\r\nas the fundamental evil, the slavery itself, remains.\r\n\r\nMy letter was interrupted as usual by clamours for my presence at the\r\ndoor, and petitions for sugar, rice, and baby clothes, from a group of\r\nwomen who had done their tasks at three o'clock in the afternoon, and had\r\ncome to say, 'Ha do missis?' (How do you do?), and beg something on their\r\nway to their huts. Observing one among them whose hand was badly maimed,\r\none finger being reduced to a mere stump, she told me it was in\r\nconsequence of the bite of a rattlesnake, which had attacked and bitten\r\nher child, and then struck her as she endeavoured to kill it; her little\r\nboy had died, but one of the drivers cut off her finger, and so she had\r\nescaped with the loss of that member only. It is yet too early in the\r\nseason for me to make acquaintance with these delightful animals; but the\r\naccounts the negroes give of their abundance is full of agreeable promise\r\nfor the future. It seems singular, considering how very common they are,\r\nthat there are not more frequent instances of the slaves being bitten by\r\nthem; to be sure, they seem to me to have a holy horror of ever setting\r\ntheir feet near either tree or bush, or anywhere but on the open road, and\r\nthe fields where they labour; and of course the snakes are not so frequent\r\nin open and frequented places, as in their proper coverts. The Red Indians\r\nare said to use successfully some vegetable cure for the bite, I believe\r\nthe leaves of the slippery ash or elm; the only infallible remedy,\r\nhowever, is suction, but of this the ignorant negroes are so afraid, that\r\nthey never can be induced to have recourse to it, being of course\r\nimmovably persuaded that the poison which is so fatal to the blood, must\r\nbe equally so to the stomach. They tell me that the cattle wandering into\r\nthe brakes and bushes are often bitten to death by these deadly creatures;\r\nthe pigs, whose fat it seems does not accept the venom into its tissues\r\nwith the same effect, escape unhurt for the most part--so much for the\r\nanti-venomous virtue of adipose matter--a consolatory consideration for\r\nsuch of us as are inclined to take on flesh more than we think graceful.\r\n\r\n_Monday morning, 25th._--This letter has been long on the stocks, dear\r\nE----. I have been busy all day, and tired, and lazy in the evening\r\nlatterly, and, moreover, feel as if such very dull matter was hardly worth\r\nsending all the way off to where you are happy to be. However, that is\r\nnonsense; I know well enough that you are glad to hear from me, be it what\r\nit will, and so I resume my chronicle. Some of my evenings have been spent\r\nin reading Mr. Clay's anti-abolition speech, and making notes on it, which\r\nI will show you when we meet. What a cruel pity and what a cruel shame it\r\nis that such a man should either know no better or do no better for his\r\ncountry than he is doing now!\r\n\r\nYesterday I for the first time bethought me of the riding privileges of\r\nwhich Jack used to make such magnificent mention when he was fishing with\r\nme at the rice-island; and desiring to visit the remoter parts of the\r\nplantation and the other end of the island, I enquired into the resources\r\nof the stable. I was told I could have a mare with foal; but I declined\r\nadding my weight to what the poor beast already carried, and my only\r\nchoice then was between one who had just foaled, or a fine stallion used\r\nas a plough horse on the plantation. I determined for the latter, and\r\nshall probably be handsomely shaken whenever I take my rides abroad.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, the 26th._--My dearest E----. I write to you to-day in great\r\ndepression and distress. I have had a most painful conversation with\r\nMr. ----, who has declined receiving any of the people's petitions\r\nthrough me. Whether he is wearied with the number of these prayers and\r\nsupplications which he would escape but for me, as they probably would\r\nnot venture to come so incessantly to him, and I of course feel bound to\r\nbring every one confided to me to him; or whether he has been annoyed at\r\nthe number of pitiful and horrible stories of misery and oppression under\r\nthe former rule of Mr. K----, which have come to my knowledge since I\r\nhave been here, and the grief and indignation caused, but which cannot by\r\nany means always be done away with, though their expression may be\r\nsilenced by his angry exclamations of 'Why do you listen to such stuff?'\r\nor 'Why do you believe such trash; don't you know the niggers are all\r\nd----d liars?' &c. I do not know; but he desired me this morning to bring\r\nhim no more complaints or requests of any sort, as the people had\r\nhitherto had no such advocate, and had done very well without, and I was\r\nonly kept in an incessant state of excitement with all the falsehoods\r\nthey 'found they could make me believe.' How well they have done without\r\nmy advocacy, the conditions which I see with my own eyes even more than\r\ntheir pitiful petitions demonstrate; it is indeed true, that the\r\nsufferings of those who come to me for redress, and still more the\r\ninjustice done to the great majority who cannot, have filled my heart\r\nwith bitterness and indignation that have overflowed my lips, till, I\r\nsuppose, ---- is weary of hearing what he has never heard before, the\r\nvoice of passionate expostulation, and importunate pleading against\r\nwrongs that he will not even acknowledge, and for creatures whose common\r\nhumanity with his own I half think he does not believe;--but I must\r\nreturn to the North, for my condition would be almost worse than\r\ntheirs--condemned to hear and see so much wretchedness, not only without\r\nthe means of alleviating it, but without permission even to represent it\r\nfor alleviation--this is no place for me, since I was not born among\r\nslaves, and cannot bear to live among them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after all what he says is true: when I am gone they will fall back\r\ninto the desperate uncomplaining habit of suffering, from which my coming\r\namong them, willing to hear and ready to help, has tempted them; he says\r\nthat bringing their complaints to me, and the sight of my credulous\r\ncommiseration, only tend to make them discontented and idle, and brings\r\nrenewed chastisement upon them; and that so, instead of really befriending\r\nthem, I am only preparing more suffering for them whenever I leave the\r\nplace, and they can no more cry to me for help. And so I see nothing for\r\nit but to go and leave them to their fate; perhaps, too, he is afraid of\r\nthe mere contagion of freedom which breathes from the very existence of\r\nthose who are free; my way of speaking to the people, of treating them, of\r\nliving with them, the appeals I make to their sense of truth, of duty, of\r\nself-respect, the infinite compassion and the human consideration I feel\r\nfor them,--all this of course makes my intercourse with them dangerously\r\nsuggestive of relations far different from anything they have ever known,\r\nand as Mr. O---- once almost hinted to me, my existence among slaves was\r\nan element of danger to the 'institution.' If I should go away, the human\r\nsympathy that I have felt for them will certainly never come near them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI was too unhappy to write any more, my dear friend, and you have been\r\nspared the rest of my paroxysm, which hereabouts culminated in the blessed\r\nrefuge of abundant tears. God will provide. He has not forgotten, nor will\r\nHe forsake these His poor children; and if I may no longer minister to\r\nthem, they yet are in His hand, who cares for them more and better than I\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nTowards the afternoon yesterday, I rowed up the river to the rice-island,\r\nby way of refreshment to my spirits, and came back to-day, Wednesday the\r\n27th, through rather a severe storm. Before going to bed last night I\r\nfinished Mr. Clay's speech, and ground my teeth over it. Before starting\r\nthis morning I received from head-man Frank a lesson on the various\r\nqualities of the various sorts of rice, and should be (at any rate till I\r\nforget all he told me, which I 'feel in my bones' will be soon) a\r\ncompetent judge and expert saleswoman. The dead white speck, which shows\r\nitself sometimes in rice as it does in teeth, is in the former, as in the\r\nlatter, a sign of decay; the finest quality of rice is what may be called\r\nflinty, clear and unclouded, and a pretty clean sparkling-looking thing it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nI will tell you something curious and pleasant about my row back. The wind\r\nwas so high and the river so rough when I left the rice-island, that just\r\nas I was about to get into the boat I thought it might not be amiss to\r\ncarry my life-preserver with me, and ran back to the house to fetch it.\r\nHaving taken that much care for my life, I jumped into the boat, and we\r\npushed off. The fifteen miles' row with a furious wind, and part of the\r\ntime the tide against us, and the huge broad turbid river broken into a\r\nfoaming sea of angry waves, was a pretty severe task for the men. They\r\npulled with a will, however, but I had to forego the usual accompaniment\r\nof their voices, for the labour was tremendous, especially towards the end\r\nof our voyage, where, of course, the nearness of the sea increased the\r\nroughness of the water terribly. The men were in great spirits, however\r\n(there were eight of them rowing, and one behind was steering); one of\r\nthem said something which elicited an exclamation of general assent, and I\r\nasked what it was; the steerer said they were pleased because there was\r\nnot another planter's lady in all Georgia who would have gone through the\r\nstorm all alone with them in a boat; i.e. without the protecting presence\r\nof a white man. 'Why,' said I, 'my good fellows, if the boat capsized, or\r\nanything happened, I am sure I should have nine chances for my life\r\ninstead of one;' at this there was one shout of 'So you would, missis!\r\ntrue for dat, missis,' and in great mutual good-humour we reached the\r\nlanding at Hampton Point.\r\n\r\nAs I walked home I pondered over this compliment of Mr. ----'s slaves to\r\nme, and did not feel quite sure that the very absence of the fear which\r\nhaunts the southern women in their intercourse with these people and\r\nprevents them from trusting themselves ever with them out of reach of\r\nwhite companionship and supervision was not one of the circumstances which\r\nmakes my intercourse with them unsafe and undesirable. The idea of\r\napprehending any mischief from them never yet crossed my brain; and in the\r\nperfect confidence with which I go amongst them, they must perceive a\r\ncurious difference between me and my lady neighbours in these parts; all\r\nhave expressed unbounded astonishment at my doing so.\r\n\r\nThe spring is fast coming on; and we shall, I suppose, soon leave\r\nGeorgia. How new and sad a chapter of my life this winter here has been!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. I cannot give way to the bitter impatience I feel at my\r\npresent position, and come back to the north without leaving my babies;\r\nand though I suppose their stay will not in any case be much prolonged in\r\nthese regions of swamp and slavery, I must, for their sakes, remain where\r\nthey are, and learn this dreary lesson of human suffering to the end. The\r\nrecord, it seems to me, must be utterly wearisome to you, as the instances\r\nthemselves I suppose in a given time (thanks to that dreadful reconciler\r\nto all that is evil--habit) would become to me.\r\n\r\nThis morning I had a visit from two of the women, Charlotte and Judy, who\r\ncame to me for help and advice for a complaint, which it really seems to\r\nme every other woman on the estate is cursed with, and which is a direct\r\nresult of the conditions of their existence; the practice of sending women\r\nto labour in the fields in the third week after their confinement is a\r\nspecific for causing this infirmity, and I know no specific for curing it\r\nunder these circumstances. As soon as these poor things had departed with\r\nsuch comfort as I could give them, and the bandages they especially begged\r\nfor, three other sable graces introduced themselves, Edie, Louisa, and\r\nDiana; the former told me she had had a family of seven children, but had\r\nlost them all through 'ill luck,' as she denominated the ignorance and ill\r\ntreatment which were answerable for the loss of these, as of so many other\r\npoor little creatures their fellows. Having dismissed her and Diana with\r\nthe sugar and rice they came to beg, I detained Louisa, whom I had never\r\nseen but in the presence of her old grandmother, whose version of the poor\r\nchild's escape to, and hiding in the woods, I had a desire to compare with\r\nthe heroine's own story. She told it very simply, and it was most\r\npathetic. She had not finished her task one day, when she said she felt\r\nill, and unable to do so, and had been severely flogged by Driver Bran, in\r\nwhose 'gang' she then was. The next day, in spite of this encouragement to\r\nlabour, she had again been unable to complete her appointed work; and Bran\r\nhaving told her that he'd tie her up and flog her if she did not get it\r\ndone, she had left the field and run into the swamp. 'Tie you up, Louisa!'\r\nsaid I, 'what is that?' She then described to me that they were fastened\r\nup by their wrists to a beam or a branch of a tree, their feet barely\r\ntouching the ground, so as to allow them no purchase for resistance or\r\nevasion of the lash, their clothes turned over their heads, and their\r\nbacks scored with a leather thong, either by the driver himself, or if he\r\npleases to inflict their punishment by deputy, any of the men he may\r\nchoose to summon to the office; it might be father, brother, husband, or\r\nlover, if the overseer so ordered it. I turned sick, and my blood curdled\r\nlistening to these details from the slender young slip of a lassie, with\r\nher poor piteous face and murmuring pleading voice. 'Oh,' said I, 'Louisa;\r\nbut the rattlesnakes, the dreadful rattlesnakes in the swamps; were you\r\nnot afraid of those horrible creatures?' 'Oh, missis,' said the poor\r\nchild, 'me no tink of dem, me forget all 'bout dem for de fretting.' 'Why\r\ndid you come home at last?' 'Oh, missis, me starve with hunger, me most\r\ndead with hunger before me come back.' 'And were you flogged, Louisa?'\r\nsaid I, with a shudder at what the answer might be. 'No, missis, me go to\r\nhospital; me almost dead and sick so long, 'spec Driver Bran him forgot\r\n'bout de flogging.' I am getting perfectly savage over all these doings,\r\nE----, and really think I should consider my own throat and those of my\r\nchildren well cut, if some night the people were to take it into their\r\nheads to clear off scores in that fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Calibanish wonderment of all my visitors at the exceedingly coarse and\r\nsimple furniture and rustic means of comfort of my abode is very droll. I\r\nhave never inhabited any apartment so perfectly devoid of what we should\r\nconsider the common decencies of life; but to them my rude chintz-covered\r\nsofa and common pine-wood table, with its green baize cloth, seem the\r\nadornings of a palace; and often in the evening, when my bairns are\r\nasleep, and M---- up-stairs keeping watch over them, and I sit writing\r\nthis daily history for your edification,--the door of the great barn-like\r\nroom is opened stealthily, and one after another, men and women come\r\ntrooping silently in, their naked feet falling all but inaudibly on the\r\nbare boards as they betake themselves to the hearth, where they squat down\r\non their hams in a circle,--the bright blaze from the huge pine logs,\r\nwhich is the only light of this half of the room, shining on their sooty\r\nlimbs and faces, and making them look like a ring of ebony idols\r\nsurrounding my domestic hearth. I have had as many as fourteen at a time\r\nsquatting silently there for nearly half an hour, watching me writing at\r\nthe other end of the room. The candles on my table give only light enough\r\nfor my own occupation, the fire light illuminates the rest of the\r\napartment; and you cannot imagine anything stranger than the effect of all\r\nthese glassy whites of eyes and grinning white teeth turned towards me,\r\nand shining in the flickering light. I very often take no notice of them\r\nat all, and they seem perfectly absorbed in contemplating me. My evening\r\ndress probably excites their wonder and admiration no less than my rapid\r\nand continuous writing, for which they have sometimes expressed\r\ncompassion, as if they thought it must be more laborious than hoeing;\r\nsometimes at the end of my day's journal I look up and say suddenly,\r\n'Well, what do you want?' when each black figure springs up at once, as if\r\nmoved by machinery, they all answer, 'Me come say ha do (how d'ye do),\r\nmissis;' and then they troop out as noiselessly as they entered, like a\r\nprocession of sable dreams, and I go off in search, if possible, of whiter\r\nones.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago I had a visit of great interest to me from several lads from\r\ntwelve to sixteen years old, who had come to beg me to give them work. To\r\nmake you understand this you must know, that wishing very much to cut some\r\nwalks and drives through the very picturesque patches of woodland not far\r\nfrom the house, I announced, through Jack, my desire to give employment in\r\nthe wood-cutting line, to as many lads as chose, when their unpaid task\r\nwas done, to come and do some work for me, for which I engaged to pay\r\nthem. At the risk of producing a most dangerous process of reflection and\r\ncalculation in their brains, I have persisted in paying what I considered\r\nwages to every slave that has been my servant; and these my labourers\r\nmust, of course, be free to work or no, as they like, and if they work for\r\nme must be paid by me. The proposition met with unmingled approbation from\r\nmy 'gang;' but I think it might be considered dangerously suggestive of\r\nthe rightful relation between work and wages; in short, very involuntarily\r\nno doubt, but, nevertheless, very effectually I am disseminating ideas\r\namong Mr. ----'s dependents, the like of which have certainly never before\r\nvisited their wool-thatched brains.\r\n\r\n_Friday, March 1._--Last night after writing so much to you I felt weary,\r\nand went out into the air to refresh my spirit. The scene just beyond the\r\nhouse was beautiful, the moonlight slept on the broad river which here is\r\nalmost the sea, and on the masses of foliage of the great southern oaks;\r\nthe golden stars of German poetry shone in the purple curtains of the\r\nnight, and the measured rush of the Atlantic unfurling its huge skirts\r\nupon the white sands of the beach (the sweetest and most awful lullaby in\r\nnature) resounded through the silent air.\r\n\r\nI have not felt well, and have been much depressed for some days past. I\r\nthink I should die if I had to live here. This morning, in order not to\r\ndie yet, I thought I had better take a ride, and accordingly mounted the\r\nhorse which I told you was one of the equestrian alternatives offered me\r\nhere; but no sooner did he feel my weight, which, after all, is mere\r\nlevity and frivolity to him, than he thought proper to rebel, and find the\r\ngrasshopper a burthen, and rear and otherwise demonstrate his disgust. I\r\nhave not ridden for a long time now, but Montreal's opposition very\r\npresently aroused the Amazon which is both natural and acquired in me, and\r\nI made him comprehend that, though I object to slaves, I expect obedient\r\nservants; which views of mine being imparted by a due administration of\r\nboth spur and whip, attended with a judicious combination of coaxing pats\r\non his great crested neck, and endearing commendations of his beauty,\r\nproduced the desired effect. Montreal accepted me as inevitable, and\r\ncarried me very wisely and well up the island to another of the slave\r\nsettlements on the plantation, called Jones's Creek.\r\n\r\nOn my way I passed some magnificent evergreen oaks,[5] and some thickets\r\nof exquisite evergreen shrubs, and one or two beautiful sites for a\r\nresidence, which made me gnash my teeth when I thought of the one we have\r\nchosen. To be sure, these charming spots, instead of being conveniently in\r\nthe middle of the plantation, are at an out of the way end of it, and so\r\nhardly eligible for the one quality desired for the overseer's abode, viz.\r\nbeing central.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The only ilex trees which I have seen comparable in size and\r\nbeauty with those of the sea-board of Georgia are some to be found in the\r\nRoman Campagna, at Passerano, Lunghegna, Castel Fusano, and other of its\r\ngreat princely farms, but especially in the magnificent woody wilderness\r\nof Valerano.]\r\n\r\nAll the slaves' huts on St. Simon's are far less solid, comfortable, and\r\nhabitable than those at the rice-island. I do not know whether the\r\nlabourer's habitation bespeaks the alteration in the present relative\r\nimportance of the crops, but certainly the cultivators of the once\r\nfar-famed long staple sea-island cotton of St. Simon's are far more\r\nmiserably housed than the rice-raisers of the other plantation. These\r\nruinous shielings, that hardly keep out wind or weather, are deplorable\r\nhomes for young or aged people, and poor shelters for the hardworking men\r\nand women who cultivate the fields in which they stand. Riding home I\r\npassed some beautiful woodland with charming pink and white blossoming\r\npeach and plum-trees, which seemed to belong to some orchard that had been\r\nattempted, and afterwards delivered over to wildness. On enquiry I found\r\nthat no fruit worth eating was ever gathered from them. What a pity it\r\nseems! for in this warm delicious winter climate any and every species of\r\nfruit might be cultivated with little pains and to great perfection. As I\r\nwas cantering along the side of one of the cotton fields I suddenly heard\r\nsome inarticulate vehement cries, and saw what seemed to be a heap of\r\nblack limbs tumbling and leaping towards me, renewing the screams at\r\nintervals as it approached. I stopped my horse, and the black ball bounded\r\nalmost into the road before me, and suddenly straightening itself up into\r\na haggard hag of a half-naked negress, exclaimed, with panting eager\r\nbreathlessness, 'Oh missis, missis! you no hear me cry, you no hear me\r\ncall. Oh missis! me call, me cry, and me run; make me a gown like dat. Do,\r\nfor massy's sake, only make me a gown like dat.' This modest request for a\r\nriding habit in which to hoe the cotton fields served for an introduction\r\nto sundry other petitions for rice and sugar and flannel, all which I\r\npromised the petitioner, but not the 'gown like dat;' whereupon I rode\r\noff, and she flung herself down in the middle of the road to get her wind\r\nand rest.\r\n\r\nThe passion for dress is curiously strong in these people, and seems as\r\nthough it might be made an instrument in converting them, outwardly at any\r\nrate, to something like civilisation; for though their own native taste\r\nis decidedly both barbarous and ludicrous, it is astonishing how very soon\r\nthey mitigate it in imitation of their white models. The fine figures of\r\nthe mulatto women in Charleston and Savannah are frequently as elegantly\r\nand tastefully dressed as those of any of their female superiors; and here\r\non St. Simon's, owing, I suppose, to the influence of the resident lady\r\nproprietors of the various plantations, and the propensity to imitation in\r\ntheir black dependents, the people that I see all seem to me much tidier,\r\ncleaner, and less fantastically dressed than those on the rice plantation,\r\nwhere no such influences reach them.\r\n\r\nOn my return from my ride I had a visit from Captain F----, the manager\r\nof a neighbouring plantation, with whom I had a long conversation about\r\nthe present and past condition of the estate, the species of feudal\r\nmagnificence in which its original owner, Major ----, lived, the iron\r\nrule of old overseer K---- which succeeded to it, and the subsequent\r\nsovereignty of his son, Mr. R---- K----, the man for whom Mr. ----\r\nentertains such a cordial esteem, and of whom every account I receive\r\nfrom the negroes seems to me to indicate a merciless sternness of\r\ndisposition that may be a virtue in a slave-driver, but is hardly a\r\nChristian grace. Captain F---- was one of our earliest visitors at the\r\nrice plantation on our arrival, and I think I told you of his mentioning,\r\nin speaking to me of the orange trees which formerly grew all round the\r\ndykes there, that he had taken Basil Hall there once in their blossoming\r\nseason, and that he had said the sight was as well worth crossing the\r\nAtlantic for as Niagara. To-day he referred to that again. He has resided\r\nfor a great many years on a plantation here, and is connected with our\r\nneighbour, old Mr. C----, whose daughter, I believe, he married. He\r\ninterested me extremely by his description of the house Major ---- had\r\nmany years ago on a part of the island called St. Clair. As far as I can\r\nunderstand there must have been an indefinite number of 'masters''\r\nresidences on this estate in the old Major's time; for what with the one\r\nwe are building, and the ruined remains of those not quite improved off\r\nthe face of the earth, and the tradition of those that have ceased to\r\nexist, even as ruins, I make out no fewer than seven. How gladly would I\r\nexchange all that remain and all that do not, for the smallest tenement\r\nin your blessed Yankee mountain village!\r\n\r\nCaptain F---- told me that at St. Clair General Oglethorpe, the good and\r\nbrave English governor of the State of Georgia in its colonial days, had\r\nhis residence, and that among the magnificent live oaks which surround the\r\nsite of the former settlement, there was one especially venerable and\r\npicturesque, which in his recollection always went by the name of General\r\nOglethorpe's Oak. If you remember the history of the colony under his\r\nbenevolent rule, you must recollect how absolutely he and his friend and\r\ncounsellor, Wesley, opposed the introduction of slavery in the colony. How\r\nwrathfully the old soldier's spirit ought to haunt these cotton fields and\r\nrice swamps of his old domain, with their population of wretched slaves! I\r\nwill ride to St. Clair and see his oak; if I should see him, he cannot\r\nhave much to say to me on the subject that I should not cry amen to.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, March 2._--I have made a gain, no doubt, in one respect in\r\ncoming here, dear E----, for, not being afraid of a rearing stallion, I\r\ncan ride; but, on the other hand, my aquatic diversions are all likely, I\r\nfear, to be much curtailed. Well may you, or any other Northern\r\nAbolitionist, consider this a heaven-forsaken region,--why? I cannot even\r\nget worms to fish with, and was solemnly assured by Jack this morning that\r\nthe whole 'point,' i.e. neighbourhood of the house, had been searched in\r\nvain for these useful and agreeable animals. I must take to some more\r\nsportsman-like species of bait; but in my total ignorance of even the kind\r\nof fish that inhabit these waters, it is difficult for me to adapt my\r\ntemptations to their taste.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I had a visit that made me very sorrowful--if anything\r\nconnected with these poor people can be called more especially sorrowful\r\nthan their whole condition; but Mr. ----'s declaration that he will\r\nreceive no more statements of grievances or petitions for redress through\r\nme, makes me as desirous now of shunning the vain appeals of these\r\nunfortunates as I used to be of receiving and listening to them. The\r\nimploring cry, 'Oh missis!' that greets me whichever way I turn, makes me\r\nlong to stop my ears now; for what can I say or do any more for them? The\r\npoor little favours--the rice, the sugar, the flannel--that they beg for\r\nwith such eagerness, and receive with such exuberant gratitude, I can, it\r\nis true, supply, and words and looks of pity and counsel of patience and\r\nsuch instruction in womanly habits of decency and cleanliness, as may\r\nenable them to better, in some degree, their own hard lot; but to the\r\nentreaty, 'Oh missis, you speak to massa for us! Oh missis, you beg massa\r\nfor us! Oh missis, you tell massa for we, he sure do as you say!'--I\r\ncannot now answer as formerly, and I turn away choking and with eyes full\r\nof tears from the poor creatures, not even daring to promise any more the\r\nfaithful transmission of their prayers.\r\n\r\nThe women who visited me yesterday evening were all in the family-way, and\r\ncame to entreat of me to have the sentence (what else can I call it?)\r\nmodified, which condemns them to resume their labour of hoeing in the\r\nfields three weeks after their confinement. They knew, of course, that I\r\ncannot interfere with their appointed labour, and therefore their sole\r\nentreaty was that I would use my influence with Mr. ---- to obtain for\r\nthem a month's respite from labour in the field after child-bearing. Their\r\nprincipal spokeswoman, a woman with a bright sweet face, called Mary, and\r\na very sweet voice, which is by no means an uncommon excellence among\r\nthem, appealed to my own experience; and while she spoke of my babies, and\r\nmy carefully tended, delicately nursed, and tenderly watched confinement\r\nand convalescence, and implored me to have a kind of labour given to them\r\nless exhausting during the month after their confinement, I held the table\r\nbefore me so hard in order not to cry that I think my fingers ought to\r\nhave left a mark on it. At length I told them that Mr. ---- had forbidden\r\nme to bring him any more complaints from them, for that he thought the\r\nease with which I received and believed their stories only tended to make\r\nthem discontented, and that, therefore, I feared I could not promise to\r\ntake their petitions to him; but that he would be coming down to 'the\r\npoint' soon, and that they had better come then some time when I was with\r\nhim, and say what they had just been saying to me: and with this, and\r\nvarious small bounties, I was forced, with a heavy heart, to dismiss them,\r\nand when they were gone, with many exclamations of, 'Oh yes, missis, you\r\nwill, you will speak to massa for we; God bless you, missis, we sure you\r\nwill!' I had my cry out for them, for myself, for us. All these women had\r\nhad large families, and _all_ of them had lost half their children, and\r\nseveral of them had lost more. How I do ponder upon the strange fate which\r\nhas brought me here, from so far away, from surroundings so curiously\r\ndifferent--how my own people in that blessed England of my birth would\r\nmarvel if they could suddenly have a vision of me as I sit here, and how\r\nsorry some of them would be for me!\r\n\r\nI am helped to bear all that is so very painful to me here by my constant\r\nenjoyment of the strange wild scenery in the midst of which I live, and\r\nwhich my resumption of my equestrian habits gives me almost daily\r\nopportunity of observing. I rode to-day to some new cleared and ploughed\r\nground that was being prepared for the precious cotton crop. I crossed a\r\nsalt marsh upon a raised causeway that was perfectly alive with\r\nland-crabs, whose desperately active endeavours to avoid my horse's hoofs\r\nwere so ludicrous that I literally laughed alone and aloud at them. The\r\nsides of this road across the swamp were covered with a thick and close\r\nembroidery of creeping moss or rather lichens of the most vivid green and\r\nred: the latter made my horse's path look as if it was edged with an\r\nexquisite pattern of coral; it was like a thing in a fairy tale, and\r\ndelighted me extremely.\r\n\r\nI suppose, E----, one secret of my being able to suffer as acutely as I do\r\nwithout being made either ill or absolutely miserable, is the childish\r\nexcitability of my temperament, and the sort of ecstacy which any\r\nbeautiful thing gives me. No day, almost no hour, passes without some\r\nenjoyment of the sort this coral-bordered road gave me, which not only\r\ncharms my senses completely at the time, but returns again and again\r\nbefore my memory, delighting my fancy, and stimulating my imagination. I\r\nsometimes despise myself for what seems to me an inconceivable rapidity of\r\nemotion, that almost makes me doubt whether anyone who feels so many\r\nthings can really be said to feel anything; but I generally recover from\r\nthis perplexity, by remembering whither invariably every impression of\r\nbeauty leads my thoughts, and console myself for my contemptible facility\r\nof impression by the reflection that it is, upon the whole, a merciful\r\nsystem of compensation by which my whole nature, tortured as it was last\r\nnight, can be absorbed this morning, in a perfectly pleasurable\r\ncontemplation of the capers of crabs and the colour of mosses as if\r\nnothing else existed in creation. One thing, however, I think, is equally\r\ncertain, and that is, that I need never expect much sympathy; and perhaps\r\nthis special endowment will make me, to some degree, independent of it;\r\nbut I have no doubt that to follow me through half a day with any species\r\nof lively participation in my feelings would be a severe breathless moral\r\ncalisthenic to most of my friends,--what Shakspeare calls 'sweating\r\nlabour.' As far as I have hitherto had opportunities of observing,\r\nchildren and maniacs are the only creatures who would be capable of\r\nsufficiently rapid transitions of thought and feeling to keep pace with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd so I rode through the crabs and the coral. There is one thing,\r\nhowever, I beg to commend to your serious consideration as a trainer of\r\nyouth, and that is, the expediency of cultivating in all the young minds\r\nyou educate an equal love of the good, the beautiful, and the absurd\r\n(not an easy task, for the latter is apt in its developement to\r\ninterfere a little with the two others): doing this, you command all the\r\nresources of existence. The love of the good and beautiful of course you\r\nare prepared to cultivate--that goes without saying, as the French say;\r\nthe love of the ludicrous will not appear to you as important, and yet\r\nyou will be wrong to undervalue it. In the first place, I might tell you\r\nthat it was almost like cherishing the love of one's\r\nfellow-creatures--at which no doubt you shake your head reprovingly;\r\nbut, leaving aside the enormous provision for the exercise of this\r\nnatural faculty which we offer to each other, why should crabs scuttle\r\nfrom under my horse's feet in such a way as to make me laugh again every\r\ntime I think of it, if there is not an inherent propriety in laughter,\r\nas the only emotion which certain objects challenge--an emotion\r\nwholesome for the soul and body of man? After all, _why_ are we\r\ncontrived to laugh at all, if laughter is not essentially befitting and\r\nbeneficial? and most people's lives are too lead-coloured to afford to\r\nlose one sparkle on them, even the smallest twinkle of light gathered\r\nfrom a flash of nonsense. Hereafter point out for the 'appreciative'\r\nstudy of your pupils all that is absurd in themselves, others, and the\r\nuniverse in general; 't is an element largely provided, of course, to\r\nmeet a corresponding and grateful capacity for its enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAfter my crab and coral causeway I came to the most exquisite thickets of\r\nevergreen shrubbery you can imagine. If I wanted to paint paradise I would\r\ncopy this undergrowth, passing through which I went on to the settlement\r\nat St. Annie's, traversing another swamp on another raised causeway. The\r\nthickets through which I next rode were perfectly draped with the\r\nbeautiful wild jasmine of these woods. Of all the parasitical plants I\r\never saw, I do think it is the most exquisite in form and colour, and its\r\nperfume is like the most delicate heliotrope.\r\n\r\nI stopped for some time before a thicket of glittering evergreens, over\r\nwhich hung, in every direction, streaming garlands of these fragrant\r\ngolden cups, fit for Oberon's banqueting service. These beautiful\r\nshrubberies were resounding with the songs of mocking birds. I sat there\r\non my horse in a sort of dream of enchantment, looking, listening, and\r\ninhaling the delicious atmosphere of those flowers; and suddenly my eyes\r\nopened, as if I had been asleep, on some bright red bunches of spring\r\nleaves on one of the winter-stripped trees, and I as suddenly thought of\r\nthe cold northern skies and earth, where the winter was still inflexibly\r\ntyrannising over you all, and, in spite of the loveliness of all that was\r\npresent, and the harshness of all that I seemed to see at that moment, no\r\nfirst tokens of the spring's return were ever more welcome to me than\r\nthose bright leaves that reminded me how soon I should leave this scene of\r\nmaterial beauty and moral degradation, where the beauty itself is of an\r\nappropriate character to the human existence it surrounds: above all,\r\nloveliness, brightness, and fragrance; but below! it gives one a sort of\r\nmelusina feeling of horror--all swamp and poisonous stagnation, which the\r\nheat will presently make alive with venomous reptiles.\r\n\r\nI rode on, and the next object that attracted my attention was a very\r\nstartling and by no means agreeable one--an enormous cypress tree which\r\nhad been burnt stood charred and blackened, and leaning towards the road\r\nso as to threaten a speedy fall across it, and on one of the limbs of this\r\ngreat charcoal giant hung a dead rattlesnake. If I tell you that it looked\r\nto me at least six feet long you will say you only wonder I did not say\r\ntwelve; it was a hideous-looking creature, and some negroes I met soon\r\nafter told me they had found it in the swamp, and hung it dead on the\r\nburning tree. Certainly the two together made a dreadful trophy, and a\r\ncurious contrast to the lovely bowers of bloom I had just been\r\ncontemplating with such delight.\r\n\r\nThis settlement at St. Annie's is the remotest on the whole plantation,\r\nand I found there the wretchedest huts, and most miserably squalid,\r\nfilthy and forlorn creatures I had yet seen here--certainly the condition\r\nof the slaves on this estate is infinitely more neglected and deplorable\r\nthan that on the rice plantation. Perhaps it may be that the extremely\r\nunhealthy nature of the rice cultivation makes it absolutely necessary\r\nthat the physical condition of the labourers should be maintained at its\r\nbest to enable them to abide it; and yet it seems to me that even the\r\nprocess of soaking the rice can hardly create a more dangerous miasma than\r\nthe poor creatures must inhale who live in the midst of these sweltering\r\nswamps, half sea, half river slime. Perhaps it has something to do with\r\nthe fact that the climate on St. Simon's is generally considered\r\npeculiarly mild and favourable, and so less protection of clothes and\r\nshelter is thought necessary here for the poor residents; perhaps, too, it\r\nmay be because the cotton crop is now, I believe, hardly as valuable as\r\nthe rice crop, and the plantation here, which was once the chief source of\r\nits owner's wealth, is becoming a secondary one, and so not worth so much\r\ncare or expense in repairing and constructing negro huts and feeding and\r\nclothing the slaves. More pitiable objects than some of those I saw at the\r\nSt. Annie's settlement to-day I hope never to see: there was an old crone\r\ncalled Hannah, a sister, as well as I could understand what she said, of\r\nold house Molly, whose face and figure seamed with wrinkles and bowed and\r\ntwisted with age and infirmity really hardly retained the semblance of\r\nthose of a human creature, and as she crawled to me almost half her naked\r\nbody was exposed through the miserable tatters that she held on with one\r\nhand, while the other eagerly clutched my hand, and her poor blear eyes\r\nwandered all over me as if she was bewildered by the strange aspect of any\r\nhuman being but those whose sight was familiar to her. One or two forlorn\r\ncreatures like herself, too old or too infirm to be compelled to work, and\r\nthe half-starved and more than half-naked children apparently left here\r\nunder their charge, were the only inmates I found in these wretched\r\nhovels.\r\n\r\nI came home without stopping to look at anything, for I had no heart any\r\nlonger for what had so charmed me on my way to this place. Galloping along\r\nthe road after leaving the marshes, I scared an ox who was feeding\r\nleisurely, and to my great dismay saw the foolish beast betake himself\r\nwith lumbering speed into the 'bush:' the slaves will have to hunt after\r\nhim, and perhaps will discover more rattlesnakes six or twelve feet long.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching home I went to the house of the overseer to see his wife, a\r\ntidy, decent, kind-hearted, little woman, who seems to me to do her duty\r\nby the poor people she lives among, as well as her limited intelligence\r\nand still more limited freedom allow. The house her husband lives in is\r\nthe former residence of Major ----, which was the great mansion of the\r\nestate. It is now in a most ruinous and tottering condition, and they\r\ninhabit but a few rooms in it; the others are gradually mouldering to\r\npieces, and the whole edifice will, I should think, hardly stand long\r\nenough to be carried away by the river, which in its yearly inroads on the\r\nbank on which it stands has already approached within a perilous proximity\r\nto the old dilapidated planter's palace. Old Molly, of whom I have often\r\nbefore spoken to you, who lived here in the days of the prosperity and\r\ngrandeur of 'Hampton,' still clings to the relics of her old master's\r\nformer magnificence and with a pride worthy of old Caleb of Ravenswood\r\nshowed me through the dismantled decaying rooms and over the remains of\r\nthe dairy, displaying a capacious fish-box or well, where, in the good old\r\ndays, the master's supply was kept in fresh salt water till required for\r\ntable. Her prideful lamentations over the departure of all this quondam\r\nglory were ludicrous and pathetic; but while listening with some amusement\r\nto the jumble of grotesque descriptions through which her impression of\r\nthe immeasurable grandeur and nobility of the house she served was the\r\npredominant feature, I could not help contrasting the present state of the\r\nestate with that which she described, and wondering why it should have\r\nbecome, as it undoubtedly must have done, so infinitely less productive a\r\nproperty than in the old Major's time.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this letter, I have a mind to transcribe to you the\r\nentries for to-day recorded in a sort of daybook, where I put down very\r\nsuccinctly the number of people who visit me, their petitions and\r\nailments, and also such special particulars concerning them as seem to me\r\nworth recording. You will see how miserable the physical condition of many\r\nof these poor creatures is; and their physical condition, it is insisted\r\nby those who uphold this evil system, is the only part of it which is\r\nprosperous, happy, and compares well with that of northern labourers.\r\nJudge from the details I now send you; and never forget, while reading\r\nthem, that the people on this plantation are well off, and consider\r\nthemselves well off, in comparison with the slaves on some of the\r\nneighbouring estates.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_ has had six children, all dead but one. She came to beg to have\r\nher work in the field lightened.\r\n\r\n_Nanny_ has had three children, two of them are dead; she came to implore\r\nthat the rule of sending them into the field three weeks after their\r\nconfinement might be altered.\r\n\r\n_Leah_, Caesar's wife, has had six children, three are dead.\r\n\r\n_Sophy_, Lewis' wife, came to beg for some old linen; she is suffering\r\nfearfully, has had ten children, five of them are dead. The principal\r\nfavour she asked was a piece of meat, which I gave her.\r\n\r\n_Sally_, Scipio's wife, has had two miscarriages and three children born,\r\none of whom is dead. She came complaining of incessant pain and weakness\r\nin her back. This woman was a mulatto daughter of a slave called Sophy, by\r\na white man of the name of Walker, who visited the plantation.\r\n\r\n_Charlotte_, Renty's wife, had had two miscarriages, and was with child\r\nagain. She was almost crippled with rheumatism, and showed me a pair of\r\npoor swollen knees that made my heart ache. I have promised her a pair of\r\nflannel trowsers, which I must forthwith set about making.\r\n\r\n_Sarah_, Stephen's wife,--this woman's case and history were, alike,\r\ndeplorable, she had had four miscarriages, had brought seven children into\r\nthe world, five of whom were dead, and was again with child. She\r\ncomplained of dreadful pains in the back, and an internal tumour which\r\nswells with the exertion of working in the fields; probably, I think, she\r\nis ruptured. She told me she had once been mad and ran into the woods,\r\nwhere she contrived to elude discovery for some time, but was at last\r\ntracked and brought back, when she was tied up by the arms and heavy logs\r\nfastened to her feet, and was severely flogged. After this she contrived\r\nto escape again, and lived for some time skulking in the woods, and she\r\nsupposes mad, for when she was taken again she was entirely naked. She\r\nsubsequently recovered from this derangement, and seems now just like all\r\nthe other poor creatures who come to me for help and pity. I suppose her\r\nconstant child-bearing and hard labour in the fields at the same time may\r\nhave produced the temporary insanity.\r\n\r\n_Sukey_, Bush's wife, only came to pay her respects. She had had four\r\nmiscarriages, had brought eleven children into the world, five of whom are\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n_Molly_, Quambo's wife, also only came to see me; hers was the best\r\naccount I have yet received; she had had nine children, and six of them\r\nwere still alive.\r\n\r\nThis is only the entry for to-day, in my diary, of the people's complaints\r\nand visits. Can you conceive a more wretched picture than that which it\r\nexhibits of the conditions under which these women live? Their cases are\r\nin no respect singular, and though they come with pitiful entreaties that\r\nI will help them with some alleviation of their pressing physical\r\ndistresses, it seems to me marvellous with what desperate patience (I\r\nwrite it advisedly, patience of utter despair) they endure their\r\nsorrow-laden existence. Even the poor wretch who told that miserable story\r\nof insanity and lonely hiding in the swamps and scourging when she was\r\nfound, and of her renewed madness and flight, did so in a sort of low,\r\nplaintive, monotonous murmur of misery, as if such sufferings were all 'in\r\nthe day's work.'\r\n\r\nI ask these questions about their children because I think the number they\r\nbear as compared with the number they rear a fair gauge of the effect of\r\nthe system on their own health and that of their offspring. There was\r\nhardly one of these women, as you will see by the details I have noted of\r\ntheir ailments, who might not have been a candidate for a bed in an\r\nhospital, and they had come to me after working all day in the fields.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. When I told you in my last letter of the encroachments\r\nwhich the waters of the Altamaha are daily making on the bank at Hampton\r\nPoint and immediately in front of the imposing-looking old dwelling of the\r\nformer master, I had no idea how rapid this crumbling process has been of\r\nlate years; but to-day, standing there with Mrs. G----, whom I had gone to\r\nconsult about the assistance we might render to some of the poor creatures\r\nwhose cases I sent you in my last letter, she told me that within the\r\nmemory of many of the slaves now living on the plantation, a grove of\r\norange trees had spread its fragrance and beauty between the house and the\r\nriver. Not a vestige remains of them. The earth that bore them was\r\ngradually undermined, slipped, and sank down into the devouring flood, and\r\nwhen she saw the astonished incredulity of my look she led me to the\r\nragged and broken bank, and there, immediately below it and just covered\r\nby the turbid waters of the in-rushing tide, were the heads of the poor\r\ndrowned orange trees, swaying like black twigs in the briny flood which\r\nhad not yet dislodged all of them from their hold upon the soil which had\r\ngone down beneath the water wearing its garland of bridal blossom. As I\r\nlooked at those trees a wild wish rose in my heart that the river and the\r\nsea would swallow up and melt in their salt waves the whole of this\r\naccursed property of ours. I am afraid the horror of slavery with which I\r\ncame down to the south, the general theoretic abhorrence of an\r\nEnglishwoman for it, has gained, through the intensity it has acquired, a\r\nmorbid character of mere desire to be delivered from my own share in it. I\r\nthink so much of these wretches that I see, that I can hardly remember any\r\nothers, and my zeal for the general emancipation of the slave, has almost\r\nnarrowed itself to this most painful desire that I and mine were freed\r\nfrom the responsibility of our share in this huge misery,--and so I\r\nthought:--'Beat, beat, the crumbling banks and sliding shores, wild waves\r\nof the Atlantic and the Altamaha! Sweep down and carry hence this evil\r\nearth and these homes of tyranny, and roll above the soil of slavery, and\r\nwash my soul and the souls of those I love clean from the blood of our\r\nkind!' But I have no idea that Mr. ---- and his brother would cry amen to\r\nany such prayer. Sometimes, as I stand and listen to the roll of the great\r\nocean surges on the further side of little St. Simon's Island, a small\r\ngreen screen of tangled wilderness that interposes between this point and\r\nthe Atlantic, I think how near our West Indian islands and freedom are to\r\nthese unfortunate people, many of whom are expert and hardy boatmen, as\r\nfar as the mere mechanical management of a boat goes; but unless\r\nProvidence were compass and steersman too it avails nothing that they\r\nshould know how near their freedom might be found, nor have I any right to\r\ntell them if they could find it, for the slaves are not mine, they are\r\nMr. ----'s.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto woman, Sally, accosted me again to-day, and begged that she\r\nmight be put to some other than field labour. Supposing she felt herself\r\nunequal to it, I asked her some questions, but the principal reason she\r\nurged for her promotion to some less laborious kind of work was, that\r\nhoeing in the field was so hard to her on '_account of her colour_,' and\r\nshe therefore petitions to be allowed to learn a trade. I was much puzzled\r\nat this reason for her petition, but was presently made to understand that\r\nbeing a mulatto, she considered field labour a degradation; her white\r\nbastardy appearing to her a title to consideration in my eyes. The\r\ndegradation of these people is very complete, for they have accepted the\r\ncontempt of their masters to that degree that they profess, and really\r\nseem to feel it for themselves, and the faintest admixture of white blood\r\nin their black veins appears at once, by common consent of their own race,\r\nto raise them in the scale of humanity. I had not much sympathy for this\r\npetition. The woman's father had been a white man who was employed for\r\nsome purpose on the estate. In speaking upon this subject to Mrs. G----,\r\nshe said that, as far as her observation went, the lower class of white\r\nmen in the south lived with coloured women precisely as they would at the\r\nnorth with women of their own race; the outcry that one hears against\r\namalgamation appears therefore to be something educated and acquired,\r\nrather than intuitive. I cannot perceive in observing my children, that\r\nthey exhibit the slightest repugnance or dislike to these swarthy\r\ndependents of theirs, which they surely would do if, as is so often\r\npretended, there is an inherent, irreconcilable repulsion on the part of\r\nthe white towards the negro race. All the southern children that I have\r\nseen seem to have a special fondness for these good-natured childish human\r\nbeings, whose mental condition is kin in its simplicity and proneness to\r\nimpulsive emotion to their own, and I can detect in them no trace of the\r\nabhorrence and contempt for their dusky skins which all questions of\r\ntreating them with common justice is so apt to elicit from American men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nTo-day, for the first time since I left the Rice Island, I went out\r\nfishing, but had no manner of luck. Jack rowed me up Jones's Creek, a\r\nsmall stream which separates St. Simon's from the main, on the opposite\r\nside from the great waters of the Altamaha. The day was very warm. It is\r\nbecoming almost too hot to remain here much longer, at least for me, who\r\ndread and suffer from heat so much. The whole summer, however, is passed\r\nby many members of the Georgia families on their estates by the sea. When\r\nthe heat is intense, the breeze from the ocean and the salt air, I\r\nsuppose, prevent it from being intolerable or hurtful. Our neighbour Mr.\r\nC---- and his family reside entirely, the year round, on their plantations\r\nhere without apparently suffering in their health from the effects of the\r\nclimate. I suppose it is the intermediate region between the sea-board and\r\nthe mountains that becomes so pestilential when once the warm weather sets\r\nin. I remember the Belgian minister, M. de ----, telling me that the\r\nmountain country of Georgia was as beautiful as paradise, and that the\r\nclimate, as far as his experience went, was perfectly delicious. He was,\r\nhowever, only there on an exploring expedition, and, of course, took the\r\nmost favourable season of the year for the purpose.\r\n\r\nI have had several women with me this afternoon more or less disabled by\r\nchronic rheumatism. Certainly, either their labour or the exposure it\r\nentails must be very severe, for this climate is the last that ought to\r\nengender rheumatism. This evening I had a visit from a bright young woman,\r\ncalling herself Minda, who came to beg for a little rice or sugar. I\r\nenquired from which of the settlements she had come down, and found that\r\nshe has to walk three miles every day to and from her work. She made no\r\ncomplaint whatever of this, and seemed to think her laborious tramp down\r\nto the Point after her day of labour on the field well-rewarded by the\r\npittance of rice and sugar she obtained. Perhaps she consoled herself for\r\nthe exertion by the reflection which occurred to me while talking to her,\r\nthat many women who have borne children, and many women with child, go the\r\nsame distance to and from their task ground--that seems dreadful!\r\n\r\nI have let my letter lie from a stress of small interruptions. Yesterday,\r\nSunday 3rd, old Auber, a stooping, halting hag, came to beg for flannel\r\nand rice. As usual, of course, I asked various questions concerning her\r\ncondition, family, &c.; she told me she had never been married, but had\r\nhad five children, two of whom were dead. She complained of flooding, of\r\nintolerable back-ache, and said that with all these ailments, she\r\nconsidered herself quite recovered, having suffered horribly from an\r\nabscess in her neck, which was now nearly well. I was surprised to hear of\r\nher other complaints, for she seemed to me like quite an old woman; but\r\nconstant child-bearing, and the life of labour, exposure, and privation\r\nwhich they lead, ages these poor creatures prematurely.\r\n\r\nDear E----, how I do defy you to guess the novel accomplishment I have\r\ndeveloped within the last two days; what do you say to my turning\r\nbutcher's boy, and cutting up the carcase of a sheep for the instruction\r\nof our butcher and cook, and benefit of our table? You know, I have often\r\nwritten you word, that we have mutton here--thanks to the short salt grass\r\non which it feeds--that compares with the best south down or _pré salé_;\r\nbut such is the barbarous ignorance of the cook, or rather the butcher who\r\nfurnishes our kitchen supplies, that I defy the most expert anatomist to\r\npronounce on any piece (joints they cannot be called) of mutton brought to\r\nour table to what part of the animal sheep it originally belonged. I have\r\noften complained bitterly of this, and in vain implored Abraham the cook\r\nto send me some dish of mutton to which I might with safety apply the\r\nfamiliar name of leg, shoulder, or haunch. These remonstrances and\r\nexpostulations have produced no result whatever, however, but an increase\r\nof eccentricity in the _chunks_ of sheeps' flesh placed upon the table;\r\nthe squares, diamonds, cubes, and rhomboids of mutton have been more\r\nludicrously and hopelessly unlike anything we see in a Christian butcher's\r\nshop, with every fresh endeavour Abraham has made to find out 'zackly wot\r\nde missis do want;' so the day before yesterday, while I was painfully\r\ndragging S---- through the early intellectual science of the alphabet and\r\nfirst reading lesson, Abraham appeared at the door of the room brandishing\r\na very long thin knife, and with many bows, grins, and apologies for\r\ndisturbing me, begged that I would go and cut up a sheep for him. My first\r\nimpulse of course was to decline the very unusual task offered me with\r\nmingled horror and amusement. Abraham, however, insisted and besought,\r\nextolled the fineness of his sheep, declared his misery at being unable\r\nto cut it as I wished, and his readiness to conform for the future to\r\nwhatever _patterns_ of mutton 'de missis would only please to give him.'\r\nUpon reflection I thought I might very well contrive to indicate upon the\r\nsheep the size and form of the different joints of civilised mutton, and\r\nso for the future save much waste of good meat; and moreover the lesson\r\nonce taught would not require to be repeated, and I have ever held it\r\nexpedient to accept every opportunity of learning to do anything, no\r\nmatter how unusual, which presented itself to be done; and so I followed\r\nAbraham to the kitchen, when, with a towel closely pinned over my silk\r\ndress, and knife in hand, I stood for a minute or two meditating\r\nprofoundly before the rather unsightly object which Abraham had pronounced\r\n'de beautifullest sheep de missis eber saw.' The sight and smell of raw\r\nmeat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had\r\nhad to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably,\r\nindeed, return entirely to my green and salad days. Nathless, I screwed my\r\ncourage to the sticking point, and slowly and delicately traced out with\r\nthe point of my long carving-knife two shoulders, two legs, a saddle, and\r\na neck of mutton; not probably in the most thoroughly artistic and\r\nbutcherly style, but as nearly as my memory and the unassisted light of\r\nnature would enable me; and having instructed Abraham in the various\r\nboundaries, sizes, shapes and names of the several joints, I returned to\r\nS---- and her belles-lettres, rather elated upon the whole at the\r\ncreditable mode in which I flattered myself I had accomplished my unusual\r\ntask, and the hope of once more seeing roast mutton of my acquaintance. I\r\nwill confess to you, dear E----, that the _neck_ was not a satisfactory\r\npart of the performance, and I have spent some thoughts since in trying to\r\nadjust in my own mind its proper shape and proportions.\r\n\r\nAs an accompaniment to 'de beautifullest mutton de missis ever see,' we\r\nhave just received from my neighbour Mr. C---- the most magnificent supply\r\nof fresh vegetables, green peas, salad, &c. He has a garden and a\r\nScotchman's real love for horticulture, and I profit by them in this very\r\nagreeable manner.\r\n\r\nI have been interrupted by several visits, my dear E----, among other, one\r\nfrom a poor creature called Judy, whose sad story and condition affected\r\nme most painfully. She had been married, she said, some years ago to one\r\nof the men called Temba, who however now has another wife, having left her\r\nbecause she went mad. While out of her mind she escaped into the jungle,\r\nand contrived to secrete herself there for some time, but was finally\r\ntracked and caught, and brought back and punished by being made to sit,\r\nday after day, for hours in the stocks--a severe punishment for a man, but\r\nfor a woman perfectly barbarous. She complained of chronic rheumatism, and\r\nother terrible ailments, and said she suffered such intolerable pain while\r\nlabouring in the fields, that she had come to entreat me to have her work\r\nlightened. She could hardly crawl, and cried bitterly all the time she\r\nspoke to me.\r\n\r\nShe told me a miserable story of her former experience on the plantation\r\nunder Mr. K----'s overseership. It seems that Jem Valiant (an extremely\r\ndifficult subject, a mulatto lad, whose valour is sufficiently accounted\r\nfor now by the influence of the mutinous white blood) was her firstborn,\r\nthe son of Mr. K----, who forced her, flogged her severely for having\r\nresisted him, and then sent her off, as a further punishment, to Five\r\nPound--a horrible swamp in a remote corner of the estate, to which the\r\nslaves are sometimes banished for such offences as are not sufficiently\r\natoned for by the lash. The dismal loneliness of the place to these poor\r\npeople, who are as dependent as children upon companionship and sympathy,\r\nmakes this solitary exile a much-dreaded infliction; and this poor\r\ncreature said, that bad as the flogging was, she would sooner have taken\r\nthat again than the dreadful lonely days and nights she spent on the penal\r\nswamp of Five Pound.\r\n\r\nI make no comment on these terrible stories, my dear friend, and tell them\r\nto you as nearly as possible in the perfectly plain unvarnished manner in\r\nwhich they are told to me. I do not wish to add to, or perhaps I ought to\r\nsay take away from, the effect of such narrations by amplifying the simple\r\nhorror and misery of their bare details.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dearest E----. I have had an uninterrupted stream of women and children\r\nflowing in the whole morning to say, 'Ha de missis!' Among others, a poor\r\nwoman called Mile, who could hardly stand for pain and swelling in her\r\nlimbs; she had had fifteen children and two miscarriages, nine of her\r\nchildren had died; for the last three years she had become almost a\r\ncripple with chronic rheumatism, yet she is driven every day to work in\r\nthe field. She held my hands and stroked them in the most appealing way,\r\nwhile she exclaimed, 'Oh my missis! my missis! me neber sleep till day for\r\nde pain,' and with the day her labour must again be resumed. I gave her\r\nflannel and sal volatile to rub her poor swelled limbs with; rest I could\r\nnot give her--rest from her labour and her pain--this mother of fifteen\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAnother of my visitors had a still more dismal story to tell; her name was\r\nDie; she had had sixteen children, fourteen of whom were dead; she had had\r\nfour miscarriages, one had been caused by falling down with a very heavy\r\nburthen on her head, and one from having her arms strained up to be\r\nlashed. I asked her what she meant by having her arms tied up; she said\r\ntheir hands were first tied together, sometimes by the wrists, and\r\nsometimes, which was worse, by the thumbs, and they were then drawn up to\r\na tree or post, so as almost to swing them off the ground, and then their\r\nclothes rolled round their waist, and a man with a cow-hide stands and\r\nstripes them. I give you the woman's words; she did not speak of this as\r\nof anything strange, unusual or especially horrid and abominable; and when\r\nI said, 'Did they do that to you when you were with child?' she simply\r\nreplied, 'Yes, missis.' And to all this I listen--I, an English woman, the\r\nwife of the man who owns these wretches, and I cannot say, 'That thing\r\nshall not be done again; that cruel shame and villany shall never be known\r\nhere again.' I gave the woman meat and flannel, which were what she came\r\nto ask for, and remained choking with indignation and grief long after\r\nthey had all left me to my most bitter thoughts.\r\n\r\nI went out to try and walk off some of the weight of horror and depression\r\nwhich I am beginning to feel daily more and more, surrounded by all this\r\nmisery and degradation that I can neither help nor hinder. The blessed\r\nspring is coming very fast, the air is full of delicious wild wood\r\nfragrances, and the wonderful songs of southern birds; the wood paths are\r\nas tempting as paths into Paradise, but Jack is in such deadly terror\r\nabout the snakes, which are now beginning to glide about with a freedom\r\nand frequency certainly not pleasing, that he will not follow me off the\r\nopen road, and twice to-day scared me back from charming wood paths I\r\nventured to explore with his exclamations of terrified warning.\r\n\r\nI gathered some exquisite pink blossoms, of a sort of waxen texture, off a\r\nsmall shrub which was strange to me, and for which Jack's only name was\r\ndye-bush; but I could not ascertain from him whether any dyeing substance\r\nwas found in its leaves, bark, or blossoms.\r\n\r\nI returned home along the river side, stopping to admire a line of noble\r\nlive oaks beginning, alas! to be smothered with the treacherous white moss\r\nunder whose pale trailing masses their verdure gradually succumbs, leaving\r\nthem, like huge hoary ghosts, perfect mountains of parasitical vegetation,\r\nwhich, strangely enough, appears only to hang upon and swing from their\r\nboughs without adhering to them. The mixture of these streams of\r\ngrey-white filaments with the dark foliage is extremely beautiful as long\r\nas the leaves of the tree survive in sufficient masses to produce the rich\r\ncontrast of colour; but when the moss has literally conquered the whole\r\ntree, and after stripping its huge limbs bare, clothed them with its own\r\nwan masses, they always looked to me like so many gigantic Druid ghosts,\r\nwith flowing robes and beards, and locks all of one ghastly grey, and I\r\nwould not have broken a twig off them for the world, lest a sad voice,\r\nlike that which reproached Dante, should have moaned out of it to me,\r\n\r\n    Non hai tu spirto di pietade alcuno?\r\n\r\nA beautiful mass of various woodland skirted the edge of the stream, and\r\nmingled in its foliage every shade of green, from the pale stiff spikes\r\nand fans of the dwarf palmetto to the dark canopy of the magnificent\r\nilex--bowers and brakes of the loveliest wildness, where one dare not\r\ntread three steps for fear--what a tantalisation! it is like some wicked\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I have found growing along the edge of the dreary enclosure\r\nwhere the slaves are buried such a lovely wild flower; it is a little like\r\nthe euphrasia or eye-bright of the English meadows; but grows quite close\r\nto the turf, almost into it, and consists of clusters of tiny white\r\nflowers that look as if they were made of the finest porcelain; I took up\r\na root of it yesterday, with a sort of vague idea that I could transplant\r\nit to the north--though I cannot say that I should care to transplant\r\nanything thither that could renew to me the associations of this\r\nplace--not even the delicious wild flowers, if I could.\r\n\r\nThe woods here are full of wild plum-trees, the delicate white blossoms of\r\nwhich twinkle among the evergreen copses, and besides illuminating them\r\nwith a faint starlight, suggest to my mind a possible liqueur like kirsch,\r\nwhich I should think could quite as well be extracted from wild plums as\r\nwild cherries, and the trees are so numerous that there ought to be quite\r\na harvest from them. You may, and, doubtless, have seen palmetto plants in\r\nnorthern green and hot houses, but you never saw palmetto roots; and what\r\ncurious things they are! huge, hard, yellowish-brown stems, as thick as my\r\narm, or thicker, extending and ramifying under the ground in masses that\r\nseem hardly justified or accounted for by the elegant, light, spiky fans\r\nof dusky green foliage with which they fill the under part of the woods\r\nhere. They look very tropical and picturesque, but both in shape and\r\ncolour suggest something metallic rather than vegetable, the bronze green\r\nhue and lance-like form of their foliage has an arid hard character that\r\nmakes one think they could be manufactured quite as well as cultivated. At\r\nfirst I was extremely delighted with the novelty of their appearance; but\r\nnow I feel thirsty when I look at them, and the same with their kinsfolk\r\nthe yuccas and their intimate friends, if not relations, the prickly\r\npears, with all of which once strange growth I have grown, contemptuously\r\nfamiliar now.\r\n\r\nDid it ever occur to you what a strange affinity there is between the\r\ntexture and colour of the wild vegetables of these sandy southern soils,\r\nand the texture and colour of shells? The prickly pear, and especially the\r\nround little cactus plants all covered with hairy spikes, are curiously\r\nsuggestive of a family of round spiked shells, with which you, as well as\r\nmyself, are, doubtless, familiar; and though the splendid flame colour of\r\nsome cactus blossoms never suggests any nature but that of flowers, I have\r\nseen some of a peculiar shade of yellow pink, that resembles the mingled\r\ntint on the inside of some elaborately coloured shell, and the pale white\r\nand rose flowers of another kind have the colouring and almost texture of\r\nshell, much rather than of any vegetable substance.\r\n\r\nTo-day I walked out without Jack, and in spite of the terror of snakes\r\nwith which he has contrived slightly to inoculate me, I did make a short\r\nexploring journey into the woods. I wished to avoid a ploughed field, to\r\nthe edge of which my wanderings had brought me; but my dash into the\r\nwoodland, though unpunished by an encounter with snakes, brought me only\r\ninto a marsh as full of land-crabs as an ant-hill is of ants, and from\r\nwhich I had to retreat ingloriously, finding my way home at last by the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nI have had, as usual, a tribe of visitors and petitioners ever since I\r\ncame home. I will give you an account of those cases which had anything\r\nbeyond the average of interest in their details. One poor woman, named\r\nMolly, came to beg that I would, if possible, get an extension of their\r\nexemption from work after child-bearing. The close of her argument was\r\nconcise and forcible. 'Missis, we hab um piccaninny--tree weeks in de\r\nospital, and den right out upon the hoe again--_can we strong_ dat way,\r\nmissis? No!' And truly I do not see that they can. This poor creature had\r\nhad eight children and two miscarriages. All her children were dead but\r\none. Another of my visitors was a divinely named but not otherwise divine\r\nVenus; it is a favourite name among these sable folk, but, of course, must\r\nhave been given originally in derision. The Aphrodite in question was a\r\ndirt-coloured (convenient colour I should say for these parts) mulatto. I\r\ncould not understand how she came on this property, for she was the\r\ndaughter of a black woman and the overseer of an estate to which her\r\nmother formerly belonged, and from which I suppose she was sold,\r\nexchanged, or given, as the case may be, to the owners of this plantation.\r\nShe was terribly crippled with rheumatism, and came to beg for some\r\nflannel. She had had eleven children, five of whom had died, and two\r\nmiscarriages. As she took her departure the vacant space she left on the\r\nother side of my writing table was immediately filled by another black\r\nfigure with a bowed back and piteous face, one of the thousand 'Mollies'\r\non the estate, where the bewildering redundancy of their name is avoided\r\nby adding that of their husband; so when the question, 'Well, who are\r\nyou?' was answered with the usual genuflexion, and 'I'se Molly, missis!'\r\nI, of course, went on with 'whose Molly?' and she went on to refer herself\r\nto the ownership (under Mr. ---- and heaven) of one Tony, but proceeded to\r\nsay that he was not her _real_ husband. This appeal to an element of\r\nreality in the universally accepted fiction which passes here by the title\r\nof marriage surprised me; and on asking her what she meant, she replied\r\nthat her real husband had been sold from the estate for repeated attempts\r\nto run away; he had made his escape several times, and skulked starving in\r\nthe woods and morasses, but had always been tracked and brought back, and\r\nflogged almost to death, and finally sold as an incorrigible runaway. What\r\na spirit of indomitable energy the wretched man must have had to have\r\ntried so often that hideously hopeless attempt to fly! I do not write you\r\nthe poor woman's jargon, which was ludicrous; for I cannot write you the\r\nsighs, and tears, and piteous looks, and gestures, that made it pathetic;\r\nof course she did not know whither or to whom her _real_ husband had been\r\nsold; but in the meantime Mr. K----, that merciful Providence of the\r\nestate, had provided her with the above-named Tony, by whom she had had\r\nnine children, six of whom were dead; she, too, had miscarried twice. She\r\ncame to ask me for some flannel for her legs, which are all swollen with\r\nconstant rheumatism, and to beg me to give her something to cure some bad\r\nsores and ulcers, which seemed to me dreadful enough in their present\r\ncondition, but which she said break out afresh and are twice as bad every\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nI have let my letter lie since the day before yesterday, dear E----,\r\nhaving had no leisure to finish it. Yesterday morning I rode out to St.\r\nClair's, where there used formerly to be another negro settlement and\r\nanother house of Major ----'s. I had been persuaded to try one of the\r\nmares I had formerly told you of, and to be sure a more 'curst' quadruped,\r\nand one more worthy of a Petruchio for a rider I did never back. Her\r\ntemper was furious, her gait intolerable, her mouth, the most obdurate\r\nthat ever tugged against bit and bridle. It is not wise anywhere--here it\r\nis less wise than anywhere else in the world--to say 'Jamais de cette eau\r\nje ne boirai;' but I _think_ I will never ride that delightful creature\r\nMiss Kate again.\r\n\r\nI wrote you of my having been to a part of the estate called St. Clair's,\r\nwhere there was formerly another residence of Major ----'s; nothing\r\nremains now of it but a ruined chimney of some of the offices, which is\r\nstanding yet in the middle of what has become a perfect wilderness. At the\r\nbest of times, with a large house, numerous household, and paths, and\r\ndrives of approach, and the usual external conditions of civilisation\r\nabout it, a residence here would have been the loneliest that can well be\r\nimagined; now it is the shaggiest desert of beautiful wood that I ever\r\nsaw. The magnificent old oaks stand round the place in silent solemn\r\ngrandeur; and among them I had no difficulty in recognising, by the\r\ndescription Captain F---- had given me of it, the crumbling shattered\r\nrelic of a tree called Oglethorpe's oak. That worthy valiant old governor\r\nhad a residence here himself in the early days of the colony; when, under\r\nthe influence of Wesley, he vainly made such strenuous efforts to keep\r\naloof from his infant province the sore curse of slavery.\r\n\r\nI rode almost the whole way through a grove of perfect evergreen. I had\r\nwith me one of the men of the name of Hector, who has a good deal to do\r\nwith the horses, and so had volunteered to accompany me, being one of the\r\nfew negroes on the estate who can sit a horse. In the course of our\r\nconversation, Hector divulged certain opinions relative to the comparative\r\ngentility of driving in a carriage, and the vulgarity of walking; which\r\nsent me into fits of laughing; at which he grinned sympathetically, and\r\nopened his eyes very wide, but certainly without attaining the least\r\ninsight into what must have appeared to him my very unaccountable and\r\nunreasonable merriment. Among various details of the condition of the\r\npeople on the several estates in the island, he told me that a great\r\nnumber of the men on all the different plantations had _wives_ on the\r\nneighbouring estates, as well as on that to which they properly belonged.\r\n'Oh, but,' said I, 'Hector, you know that cannot be, a man has but one\r\nlawful wife.' Hector knew this, he said, and yet seemed puzzled himself,\r\nand rather puzzled me to account for the fact, that this extensive\r\npractice of bigamy was perfectly well known to the masters and overseers,\r\nand never in any way found fault with, or interfered with. Perhaps this\r\npromiscuous mode of keeping up the slave population finds favour with the\r\nowners of creatures who are valued in the market at so much per head. This\r\nwas a solution which occurred to me, but which I left my Trojan hero to\r\ndiscover, by dint of the profound pondering into which he fell.\r\n\r\nNot far from the house as I was cantering home, I met S----, and took her\r\nup on the saddle before me, an operation which seemed to please her better\r\nthan the vicious horse I was riding, whose various demonstrations of\r\ndislike to the arrangement afforded my small equestrian extreme delight\r\nand triumph. My whole afternoon was spent in shifting my bed and bed-room\r\nfurniture from a room on the ground-floor to one above; in the course of\r\nwhich operation, a brisk discussion took place between M---- and my boy\r\nJack, who was nailing on the vallence of the bed; and whom I suddenly\r\nheard exclaim in answer to something she had said--'Well den, I do tink\r\nso; and dat's the speech of a man, whether um bond or free.' A very\r\ntrifling incident, and insignificant speech; and yet it came back to my\r\nears very often afterward--'the speech of a _man_, whether bond or free.'\r\nThey might be made conscious--some of them are evidently conscious--of an\r\ninherent element of manhood superior to the bitter accident of slavery;\r\nand to which, even in their degraded condition, they might be made to\r\nrefer that vital self-respect which can survive all external pressure of\r\nmere circumstance, and give their souls to that service of God, which is\r\nperfect freedom, in spite of the ignoble and cruel bondage of their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nMy new apartment is what I should call decidedly airy; the window, unless\r\nwhen styled by courtesy, shut, which means admitting of draught enough to\r\nblow a candle out, must be wide open, being incapable of any intermediate\r\ncondition; the latch of the door, to speak the literal truth, does shut;\r\nbut it is the only part of it that does; that is, the latch and the\r\nhinges; everywhere else its configuration is traced by a distinct line of\r\nlight and air. If what old Dr. Physic used to say be true, that a draught\r\nwhich will not blow out a candle will blow out a man's life, (a Spanish\r\nproverb originally I believe) my life is threatened with extinction in\r\nalmost every part of this new room of mine, wherein, moreover, I now\r\ndiscover to my dismay, having transported every other article of bed-room\r\nfurniture to it, it is impossible to introduce the wardrobe for my\r\nclothes. Well, our stay here is drawing to a close, and therefore these\r\nsmall items of discomfort cannot afflict me much longer.\r\n\r\nAmong my visitors to-day was a poor woman named Oney, who told me her\r\nhusband had gone away from her now for four years; it seems he was the\r\nproperty of Mr. K----, and when that gentleman went to slave-driving on\r\nhis own account, and ceased to be the overseer of this estate, he carried\r\nher better half, who was his chattel, away with him, and she never expects\r\nto see him again. After her departure I had a most curious visitor, a\r\nyoung lad of the name of Renty, whose very decidedly mulatto tinge\r\naccounted, I suppose, for the peculiar disinvoltura of his carriage and\r\nmanner; he was evidently in his own opinion a very superior creature; and\r\nyet, as his conversation with me testified, he was conscious of some flaw\r\nin the honour of his 'yellow' complexion. 'Who is your mother, Renty?'\r\nsaid I (I give you our exact dialogue); 'Betty, head-man Frank's wife.' I\r\nwas rather dismayed at the promptness of this reply, and hesitated a\r\nlittle at my next question, 'Who is your father?' My sprightly young\r\nfriend, however, answered, without an instant's pause, 'Mr. K----.' Here I\r\ncame to a halt, and, willing to suggest some doubt to the lad, because for\r\nmany peculiar reasons this statement seemed to me shocking, I said, 'What,\r\nold Mr. K----?' 'No, massa R----.' 'Did your mother tell you so?' 'No,\r\nmissis, me ashamed to ask her; Mr. C----'s children told me so, and I\r\n'spect they know it.' Renty, you see, did not take Falconbridge's view of\r\nsuch matters; and as I was by no means sorry to find that he considered\r\nhis relation to Mr. K---- a disgrace to his mother, which is an advance in\r\nmoral perception not often met with here, I said no more upon the subject.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, March 3._--This morning, old House Molly, coming from Mr.\r\nG----'s upon some errand to me, I asked her if Renty's statement was true;\r\nshe confirmed the whole story, and, moreover, added that this connection\r\ntook place after Betty was married to head-man Frank. Now, he, you know,\r\nE----, is the chief man at the Rice Island, second in authority to Mr.\r\nO----, and indeed, for a considerable part of the year, absolute master\r\nand guardian during the night, of all the people and property at the rice\r\nplantation, for, after the early spring, the white overseer himself is\r\nobliged to betake himself to the mainland to sleep, out of the influence\r\nof the deadly malaria of the rice swamp, and Frank remains sole sovereign\r\nof the island, from sunset to sunrise, in short, during the whole period\r\nof his absence. Mr. ---- bestowed the highest commendations upon his\r\nfidelity and intelligence, and, during the visit Mr. R---- K---- paid us\r\nat the island, he was emphatic in his praise of both Frank and his wife,\r\nthe latter having, as he declared, by way of climax to his eulogies, quite\r\nthe principles of a white woman. Perhaps she imbibed them from his\r\nexcellent influence over her. Frank is a serious, sad, sober-looking, very\r\nintelligent man; I should think he would not relish having his wife\r\nborrowed from him even by the white gentleman, who admired her principles\r\nso much; and it is quite clear from poor Renty's speech about his mother,\r\nthat by some of these people (and if by any, then very certainly by\r\nFrank), the disgrace of such an injury is felt and appreciated much after\r\nthe fashion of white men.\r\n\r\nThis old woman Molly is a wonderfully intelligent, active, energetic\r\ncreature, though considerably over seventy years old; she was talking to\r\nme about her former master, Major ----, and what she was pleased to call\r\nthe _revelation_ war (i.e. revolution war), during which that gentleman,\r\nhaving embraced the side of the rebellious colonies in their struggle\r\nagainst England, was by no means on a bed of roses. He bore King George's\r\ncommission, and was a major in the British army, but having married a\r\ngreat Carolina heiress, and become proprietor of these plantations, sided\r\nwith the country of his adoption, and not that of his birth, in the war\r\nbetween them, and was a special object of animosity on that account to the\r\nEnglish officers who attacked the sea-board of Georgia, and sent troops on\r\nshore and up the Altamaha, to fetch off the negroes, or incite them to\r\nrise against their owners. 'De British,' said Molly 'make old massa run\r\nabout bery much in de great revelation war.' He ran effectually, however,\r\nand contrived to save both his life and property from the invader.\r\n\r\nMolly's account was full of interest, in spite of the grotesque lingo in\r\nwhich it was delivered, and which once or twice nearly sent me into\r\nconvulsions of laughing, whereupon she apologized with great gravity for\r\nher mispronunciation, modestly suggesting that _white words_ were\r\nimpossible to the organs of speech of black folks. It is curious how\r\nuniversally any theory, no matter how absurd, is accepted by these people,\r\nfor anything in which the contemptuous supremacy of the dominant race is\r\nadmitted, and their acquiescence in the theory of their own incorrigible\r\nbaseness is so complete, that this, more than any other circumstance in\r\ntheir condition, makes me doubtful of their rising from it.\r\n\r\nIn order to set poor dear old Molly's notions straight with regard to the\r\nnegro incapacity for speaking plain the noble white words, I called\r\nS---- to me and set her talking; and having pointed out to Molly how very\r\nimperfect her mode of pronouncing many words was, convinced the worthy old\r\nnegress that want of training, and not any absolute original impotence,\r\nwas the reason why she disfigured the _white words_, for which she had\r\nsuch a profound respect. In this matter, as in every other, the slaves pay\r\nback to their masters the evil of their own dealings with usury, though\r\nunintentionally. No culture, however slight, simple, or elementary, is\r\npermitted to these poor creatures, and the utterance of many of them is\r\nmore like what Prospero describes Caliban's to have been, than the speech\r\nof men and women in a Christian and civilised land: the children of their\r\nowners, brought up among them, acquire their negro mode of\r\ntalking;--slavish speech surely it is--and it is distinctly perceptible in\r\nthe utterances of all southerners, particularly of the women, whose\r\navocations, taking them less from home, are less favourable to their\r\nthrowing off this ignoble trick of pronunciation, than the more varied\r\noccupation, and the more extended and promiscuous business relations of\r\nmen. The Yankee twang of the regular down Easter is not more easily\r\ndetected by any ear, nice in enunciation and accent, than the thick negro\r\nspeech of the southerners: neither is lovely or melodious; but though the\r\nPuritan snuffle is the harsher of the two, the slave _slobber_ of the\r\nlanguage is the more ignoble, in spite of the softer voices of the pretty\r\nsouthern women who utter it.\r\n\r\nI rode out to-day upon Miss Kate again, with Jack for my esquire. I made\r\nvarious vain attempts to ride through the woods, following the cattle\r\ntracks; they turned round and round into each other, or led out into the\r\nsandy pine barren, the eternal frame in which all nature is set here, the\r\ninevitable limit to the prospect, turn landward which way you will. The\r\nwood paths which I followed between evergreen thickets, though little\r\nsatisfactory in their ultimate result, were really more beautiful than the\r\nmost perfect arrangement of artificial planting that I ever saw in an\r\nEnglish park; and I thought if I could transplant the region which I was\r\nriding through bodily into the midst of some great nobleman's possessions\r\non the other side of the water, how beautiful an accession it would be\r\nthought to them. I was particularly struck with the elegant growth of a\r\nprofuse wild shrub I passed several times to-day, the leaves of which were\r\npale green underneath, and a deep red, varnished brown above.\r\n\r\nI must give you an idea of the sort of service one is liable to obtain\r\nfrom one's most intelligent and civilised servants hereabouts, and the\r\nconsequent comfort and luxury of one's daily existence. Yesterday,\r\nAleck, the youth who fulfils the duties of what you call a waiter, and\r\nwe in England a footman, gave me a salad for dinner, mixed with so large\r\na portion of the soil in which it had grown, that I requested him to-day\r\nto be kind enough to wash the lettuce before he brought it to table.\r\nM---- later in the day told me that he had applied to her very urgently\r\nfor soap and a brush 'as missis wished de lettuce scrubbed,' a fate from\r\nwhich my second salad was saved by her refusal of these desired\r\narticles, and further instructions upon the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. I have been long promising poor old House Molly to visit\r\nher in her own cabin, and so the day before yesterday I walked round the\r\nsettlement to her dwelling; and a most wretched hovel I found it. She has\r\noften told me of the special directions left by her old master for the\r\ncomfort and well-being of her old age; and certainly his charge has been\r\nbut little heeded by his heirs, for the poor faithful old slave is most\r\nmiserably off in her infirm years. She made no complaint, however, but\r\nseemed overjoyed at my coming to see her. She took me to the hut of her\r\nbrother, Old Jacob, where the same wretched absence of every decency and\r\nevery comfort prevailed; but neither of them seemed to think the condition\r\nthat appeared so wretched to me one of peculiar hardship--though Molly's\r\nformer residence in her master's house might reasonably have made her\r\ndiscontented with the lot of absolute privation to which she was now\r\nturned over--but, for the moment, my visit seemed to compensate for all\r\nsublunary sorrows, and she and poor old Jacob kept up a duet of rejoicing\r\nat my advent, and that I had brought 'de little missis among um people\r\nafore they die.'\r\n\r\nLeaving them, I went on to the house of Jacob's daughter Hannah, with whom\r\nPsyche, the heroine of the Rice Island story, and wife of his son Joe,\r\nlives. I found their cabin as tidy and comfortable as it could be made,\r\nand their children, as usual, neat and clean; they are capital women, both\r\nof them, with an innate love of cleanliness and order most uncommon among\r\nthese people. On my way home, I overtook two of my daily suppliants, who\r\nwere going to the house in search of me, and meat, flannel, rice, and\r\nsugar, as the case might be; they were both old and infirm-looking women,\r\nand one of them, called Scylla, was extremely lame, which she accounted\r\nfor by an accident she had met with while carrying a heavy weight of rice\r\non her head; she had fallen on a sharp stake, or snag, as she called it,\r\nand had never recovered the injury she had received. She complained also\r\nof falling of the womb. Her companion (who was not Charybdis however, but\r\nPhoebe) was a cheery soul who complained of nothing, but begged for\r\nflannel. I asked her about her family and children; she had no children\r\nleft, nothing but grandchildren; she had had nine children, and seven of\r\nthem died quite young; the only two who grew up left her to join the\r\nBritish when they invaded Georgia in the last war, and their children,\r\nwhom they left behind, were all her family now.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I made my first visit to the hospital of the estate, and\r\nfound it, as indeed I find everything else here, in a far worse state even\r\nthan the wretched establishments on the Rice Island, dignified by that\r\nname; so miserable a place for the purpose to which it was dedicated I\r\ncould not have imagined on a property belonging to Christian owners. The\r\nfloor (which was not boarded, but merely the damp hard earth itself,) was\r\nstrewn with wretched women, who, but for their moans of pain and uneasy\r\nrestless motions, might very well have each been taken for a mere heap of\r\nfilthy rags; the chimney refusing passage to the smoke from the pine wood\r\nfire, it puffed out in clouds through the room, where it circled and hung,\r\nonly gradually oozing away through the windows, which were so far well\r\nadapted to the purpose that there was not a single whole pane of glass in\r\nthem. My eyes, unaccustomed to the turbid atmosphere, smarted and watered,\r\nand refused to distinguish at first the different dismal forms, from which\r\ncries and wails assailed me in every corner of the place. By degrees I was\r\nable to endure for a few minutes what they were condemned to live their\r\nhours and days of suffering and sickness through; and, having given what\r\ncomfort kind words and promises of help in more substantial forms could\r\nconvey, I went on to what seemed a yet more wretched abode of\r\nwretchedness. This was a room where there was no fire because there was no\r\nchimney, and where the holes made for windows had no panes or glasses in\r\nthem. The shutters being closed, the place was so dark that, on first\r\nentering it, I was afraid to stir lest I should fall over some of the\r\ndeplorable creatures extended upon the floor. As soon as they perceived\r\nme, one cry of 'Oh missis!' rang through the darkness; and it really\r\nseemed to me as if I was never to exhaust the pity and amazement and\r\ndisgust which this receptacle of suffering humanity was to excite in me.\r\nThe poor dingy supplicating sleepers upraised themselves as I cautiously\r\nadvanced among them; those who could not rear their bodies from the earth\r\nheld up piteous beseeching hands, and as I passed from one to the other, I\r\nfelt more than one imploring clasp laid upon my dress to solicit my\r\nattention to some new form of misery. One poor woman, called Tressa, who\r\nwas unable to speak above a whisper from utter weakness and exhaustion,\r\ntold me she had had nine children, was suffering from incessant flooding,\r\nand felt 'as if her back would split open.' There she lay, a mass of\r\nfilthy tatters, without so much as a blanket under or over her, on the\r\nbare earth in this chilly darkness. I promised them help and comfort, beds\r\nand blankets, and light and fire--that is, I promised to ask Mr. ---- for\r\nall this for them; and, in the very act of doing so, I remembered with a\r\nsudden pang of anguish, that I was to urge no more petitions for his\r\nslaves to their master. I groped my way out, and emerging on the piazza,\r\nall the choking tears and sobs I had controlled broke forth, and I leaned\r\nthere crying over the lot of these unfortunates, till I heard a feeble\r\nvoice of 'Missis, you no cry; missis, what for you cry?' and looking up,\r\nsaw that I had not yet done with this intolerable infliction. A poor\r\ncrippled old man, lying in the corner of the piazza, unable even to crawl\r\ntowards me, had uttered this word of consolation, and by his side\r\n(apparently too idiotic, as he was too impotent, to move,) sat a young\r\nwoman, the expression of whose face was the most suffering and at the same\r\ntime the most horribly repulsive I ever saw. I found she was, as I\r\nsupposed, half-witted; and on coming nearer to enquire into her ailments\r\nand what I could do for her, found her suffering from that horrible\r\ndisease--I believe some form of scrofula--to which the negroes are\r\nsubject, which attacks and eats away the joints of their hands and\r\nfingers--a more hideous and loathsome object I never beheld; her name was\r\nPatty, and she was grand-daughter to the old crippled creature by whose\r\nside she was squatting.\r\n\r\nI wandered home, stumbling with crying as I went, and feeling so utterly\r\nmiserable that I really hardly saw where I was going, for I as nearly as\r\npossible fell over a great heap of oyster shells left in the middle of the\r\npath. This is a horrid nuisance, which results from an indulgence which\r\nthe people here have and value highly; the waters round the island are\r\nprolific in shell fish, oysters, and the most magnificent prawns I ever\r\nsaw. The former are a considerable article of the people's diet, and the\r\nshells are allowed to accumulate, as they are used in the composition of\r\nwhich their huts are built, and which is a sort of combination of mud and\r\nbroken oyster shells, which forms an agglomeration of a kind very solid\r\nand durable for such building purposes. But instead of being all carried\r\nto some specified place out of the way, these great heaps of oyster shells\r\nare allowed to be piled up anywhere and everywhere, forming the most\r\nunsightly obstructions in every direction. Of course, the cultivation of\r\norder for the sake of its own seemliness and beauty is not likely to be an\r\nelement of slave existence; and as masters have been scarce on this\r\nplantation for many years now, a mere unsightliness is not a matter likely\r\nto trouble anybody much; but after my imminent overthrow by one of these\r\ndisorderly heaps of refuse, I think I may make bold to request that the\r\npaths along which I am likely to take my daily walks may be kept free from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at home--at the house--I cannot call any place here my\r\nhome!--I found Renty waiting to exhibit to me an extremely neatly made\r\nleather pouch, which he has made by my order, of fitting size and\r\ndimensions, to receive Jack's hatchet and saw. Jack and I have set up a\r\nsort of Sir Walter and Tom Purdie companionship of clearing and cutting\r\npaths through the woods nearest to the house; thinning the overhanging\r\nbranches, clearing the small evergreen thickets which here and there close\r\nover and across the grassy track. To me this occupation was especially\r\ndelightful until quite lately, since the weather began to be rather warmer\r\nand the snakes to slide about. Jack has contrived to inoculate me with\r\nsome portion of his terror of them; but I have still a daily hankering\r\nafter the lovely green wood walks; perhaps when once I have seen a live\r\nrattlesnake my enthusiasm for them will be modified to the degree that his\r\nis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. This letter has remained unfinished, and my journal\r\ninterrupted for more than a week. Mr. ---- has been quite unwell, and I\r\nhave been travelling to and fro daily between Hampton and the Rice Island\r\nin the long boat to visit him; for the last three days I have remained at\r\nthe latter place, and only returned here this morning early. My daily\r\nvoyages up and down the river have introduced me to a great variety of new\r\nmusical performances of our boatmen, who invariably, when the rowing is\r\nnot too hard, moving up or down with the tide, accompany the stroke of\r\ntheir oars with the sound of their voices. I told you formerly that I\r\nthought I could trace distinctly some popular national melody with which\r\nI was familiar in almost all their songs; but I have been quite at a loss\r\nto discover any such foundation for many that I have heard lately, and\r\nwhich have appeared to me extraordinarily wild and unaccountable. The way\r\nin which the chorus strikes in with the burthen, between each phrase of\r\nthe melody chanted by a single voice, is very curious and effective,\r\nespecially with the rhythm of the rowlocks for accompaniment. The high\r\nvoices all in unison, and the admirable time and true accent with which\r\ntheir responses are made, always make me wish that some great musical\r\ncomposer could hear these semi-savage performances. With a very little\r\nskilful adaptation and instrumentation, I think one or two barbaric chants\r\nand choruses might be evoked from them that would make the fortune of an\r\nopera.\r\n\r\nThe only exception that I have met with, yet among our boat voices to the\r\nhigh tenor which they seem all to possess is in the person of an\r\nindividual named Isaac, a basso profondo of the deepest dye, who\r\nnevertheless never attempts to produce with his different register any\r\ndifferent effects in the chorus by venturing a second, but sings like the\r\nrest in unison, perfect unison, of both time and tune. By-the-by, this\r\nindividual _does_ speak, and therefore I presume he is not an ape,\r\nourang-outang, chimpanzee, or gorilla; but I could not, I confess, have\r\nconceived it possible that the presence of articulate sounds, and the\r\nabsence of an articulate tail, should make, externally at least, so\r\ncompletely the only appreciable difference between a man and a monkey, as\r\nthey appear to do in this individual 'black brother.' Such stupendous long\r\nthin hands, and long flat feet, I did never see off a large quadruped of\r\nthe ape species. But, as I said before, Isaac _speaks_, and I am much\r\ncomforted thereby.\r\n\r\nYou cannot think (to return to the songs of my boatmen) how strange some\r\nof their words are: in one, they repeatedly chanted the 'sentiment' that\r\n'God made man, and man makes'--what do you think?--'money!' Is not that a\r\npeculiar poetical proposition? Another ditty to which they frequently\r\ntreat me they call Caesar's song; it is an extremely spirited war-song,\r\nbeginning 'The trumpets blow, the bugles sound--Oh, stand your ground!' It\r\nhas puzzled me not a little to determine in my own mind whether this title\r\nof Caesar's song has any reference to the great Julius, and if so what may\r\nbe the negro notion of him, and whence and how derived. One of their songs\r\ndispleased me not a little, for it embodied the opinion that 'twenty-six\r\nblack girls not make mulatto yellow girl;' and as I told them I did not\r\nlike it, they have omitted it since. This desperate tendency to despise\r\nand undervalue their own race and colour, which is one of the very worst\r\nresults of their abject condition, is intolerable to me.\r\n\r\nWhile rowing up and down the broad waters of the Altamaha to the music of\r\nthese curious chants, I have been reading Mr. Moore's speech about the\r\nabolition of slavery in the district of Columbia; and I confess I think\r\nhis the only defensible position yet taken, and the only consistent\r\nargument yet used in any of the speeches I have hitherto seen upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI have now settled down at Hampton again; Mr. ---- is quite recovered, and\r\nis coming down here in a day or two for change of air; it is getting too\r\nlate for him to stay on the rice plantation even in the day, I think. You\r\ncannot imagine anything so exquisite as the perfect curtains of yellow\r\njasmine with which this whole island is draped; and as the boat comes\r\nsweeping down towards the point, the fragrance from the thickets hung with\r\ntheir golden garlands greets one before one can distinguish them; it is\r\nreally enchanting.\r\n\r\nI have now to tell you of my hallowing last Sunday by gathering a\r\ncongregation of the people into my big sitting-room, and reading prayers\r\nto them. I had been wishing very much to do this for some time past, and\r\nobtained Mr. ----'s leave while I was with him at the Rice Island, and it\r\nwas a great pleasure to me. Some of the people are allowed to go up to\r\nDarien once a month to church; but, with that exception, they have no\r\nreligious service on Sunday whatever for them. There is a church on the\r\nIsland of St. Simon, but they are forbidden to frequent it, as it leads\r\nthem off their own through neighbouring plantations, and gives\r\nopportunities for meetings between the negroes of the different estates,\r\nand very likely was made the occasion of abuses and objectionable\r\npractices of various kinds; at any rate, Mr. K---- forbade the Hampton\r\nslaves resorting to the St. Simon's church; and so, for three Sundays in\r\nthe month they are utterly without Christian worship or teaching, or any\r\nreligious observance of God's day whatever.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious that it should not be thought that I _ordered_ any of\r\nthe people to come to prayers, as I particularly desired to see if they\r\nthemselves felt the want of any Sabbath service, and would of their own\r\naccord join in any such ceremony; I therefore merely told the house\r\nservants that if they would come to the sitting-room at eleven o'clock, I\r\nwould read prayers to them, and that they might tell any of their friends\r\nor any of the people that I should be very glad to see them if they liked\r\nto come. Accordingly, most of those who live at the Point, i.e. in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the house, came, and it was encouraging to see\r\nthe very decided efforts at cleanliness and decorum of attire which they\r\nhad all made. I was very much affected and impressed myself by what I was\r\ndoing, and I suppose must have communicated some of my own feeling to\r\nthose who heard me. It is an extremely solemn thing to me to read the\r\nScriptures aloud to any one, and there was something in my relation to the\r\npoor people by whom I was surrounded that touched me so deeply while thus\r\nattempting to share with them the best of my possessions, that I found it\r\ndifficult to command my voice, and had to stop several times in order to\r\ndo so. When I had done, they all with one accord uttered the simple words,\r\n'We thank you, missis,' and instead of overwhelming me as usual with\r\npetitions and complaints, they rose silently and quietly, in a manner that\r\nwould have become the most orderly of Christian congregations accustomed\r\nto all the impressive decorum of civilised church privileges. Poor people!\r\nThey are said to have what a very irreligious young English clergyman once\r\ninformed me I had--a '_turn_ for religion.' They seem to me to have a\r\n'turn' for instinctive good manners too; and certainly their mode of\r\nwithdrawing from my room after our prayers bespoke either a strong feeling\r\nof their own or a keen appreciation of mine.\r\n\r\nI have resumed my explorations in the woods with renewed enthusiasm, for\r\nduring my week's absence they have become more lovely and enticing than\r\never: unluckily, however, Jack seems to think that fresh rattlesnakes have\r\nbudded together with the tender spring foliage, and I see that I shall\r\neither have to give up my wood walks and rides, or go without a guide.\r\nLovely blossoms are springing up everywhere, weeds, of course, wild\r\nthings, impertinently so called. Nothing is cultivated here but cotton;\r\nbut in some of the cotton fields, beautiful creatures are peeping into\r\nblossom, which I suppose will all be duly hoed off the surface of the\r\nsoil in proper season: meantime I rejoice in them, and in the splendid\r\nmagnificent thistles, which would be in flower-gardens in other parts of\r\nthe world, and in the wonderful, strange, beautiful butterflies that seem\r\nto me almost as big as birds, that go zig-zagging in the sun. I saw\r\nyesterday a lovely monster, who thought proper, for my greater\r\ndelectation, to alight on a thistle I was admiring, and as the flower was\r\npurple, and he was all black velvet, fringed with gold, I was exceedingly\r\npleased with his good inspiration.\r\n\r\nThis morning I drove up to the settlement at St. Annie's, having various\r\nbundles of benefaction to carry in the only equipage my estate here\r\naffords,--an exceedingly small, rough, and uncomfortable cart, called the\r\nsick house waggon, inasmuch as it is used to convey to the hospital such\r\nof the poor people as are too ill to walk there. Its tender mercies must\r\nbe terrible indeed for the sick, for I who am sound could very hardly\r\nabide them; however, I suppose Montreal's pace is moderated for them:\r\nto-day he went rollicking along with us behind him, shaking his fine head\r\nand mane, as if he thought the more we were jolted the better we should\r\nlike it. We found, on trying to go on to Cartwright's Point, that the\r\nstate of the tide would not admit of our getting thither, and so had to\r\nreturn, leaving it unvisited. It seems to me strange that where the labour\r\nof so many hands might be commanded, piers, and wharves, and causeways,\r\nare not thrown out (wooden ones, of course, I mean), wherever the common\r\ntraffic to or from different parts of the plantation is thus impeded by\r\nthe daily rise and fall of the river; the trouble and expense would be\r\nnothing, and the gain in convenience very considerable. However, perhaps\r\nthe nature of the tides, and of the banks and shores themselves, may not\r\nbe propitious for such constructions, and I rather incline upon reflection\r\nto think this may be so, because to go from Hampton to our neighbour Mr.\r\nC----'s plantation, it is necessary to consult the tide in order to land\r\nconveniently. Driving home to-day by Jones' Creek, we saw an immovable row\r\nof white cranes, all standing with imperturbable gravity upon one leg. I\r\nthought of Boccaccio's cook, and had a mind to say, Ha! at them to try if\r\nthey had two. I have been over to Mr. C----, and was very much pleased\r\nwith my visit, but will tell you of it in my next.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. I promised to tell you of my visit to my neighbour Mr. C----,\r\nwhich pleased and interested me very much. He is an old Glasgow man, who\r\nhas been settled here many years. It is curious how many of the people\r\nround this neighbourhood have Scotch names; it seems strange to find them\r\nthus gathered in the vicinity of a new Darien; but those in our immediate\r\nneighbourhood seem to have found it a far less fatal region than their\r\ncountrymen did its namesake of the Isthmus. Mr. C----'s house is a roomy,\r\ncomfortable, handsomely laid out mansion, to which he received me with\r\nvery cordial kindness, and where I spent part of a very pleasant morning,\r\ntalking with him, hearing all he could tell me of the former history of\r\nMr. ----'s plantation. His description of its former master, old\r\nMajor ----, and of his agent and overseer Mr. K----, and of that\r\ngentleman's worthy son and successor the late overseer, interested me very\r\nmuch; of the two latter functionaries his account was terrible, and much\r\nwhat I had supposed any impartial account of them would be; because, let\r\nthe propensity to lying of the poor wretched slaves be what it will, they\r\ncould not invent, with a common consent, the things that they one and all\r\ntell me with reference to the manner in which they have been treated by\r\nthe man who has just left the estate, and his father, who for the last\r\nnineteen years have been sole sovereigns of their bodies and souls. The\r\ncrops have satisfied the demands of the owners, who, living in\r\nPhiladelphia, have been perfectly contented to receive a large income\r\nfrom their estate without apparently caring how it was earned. The\r\nstories that the poor people tell me of the cruel tyranny under which\r\nthey have lived are not complaints, for they are of things past and gone,\r\nand very often, horridly as they shock and affect me, they themselves\r\nseem hardly more than half conscious of the misery their condition\r\nexhibits to me, and they speak of things which I shudder to hear of,\r\nalmost as if they had been matters of course with them.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. C---- spoke with extreme kindness of his own people, and had\r\nevidently bestowed much humane and benevolent pains upon endeavours to\r\nbetter their condition. I asked him if he did not think the soil and\r\nclimate of this part of Georgia admirably suited to the cultivation of the\r\nmulberry and the rearing of the silk-worm; for it has appeared to me that\r\nhereafter, silk may be made one of the most profitable products of this\r\nwhole region: he said that that had long been his opinion, and he had at\r\none time had it much at heart to try the experiment, and had proposed to\r\nMajor ---- to join him in it, on a scale large enough to test it\r\nsatisfactorily; but he said Mr. K---- opposed the scheme so persistently\r\nthat of course it was impossible to carry it out, as his agency and\r\ncooperation were indispensable; and that in like manner he had suggested\r\nsowing turnip crops, and planting peach trees for the benefit and use of\r\nthe people on the Hampton estate, experiments which he had tried with\r\nexcellent success on his own; but all these plans for the amelioration and\r\nprogress of the people's physical condition had been obstructed and\r\nfinally put entirely aside by old Mr. K---- and his son, who, as Mr. C----\r\nsaid, appeared to give satisfaction to their employers, so it was not his\r\nbusiness to find fault with them; he said, however, that the whole\r\ncondition and treatment of the slaves had changed from the time of\r\nMajor ----'s death, and that he thought it providential for the poor\r\npeople that Mr. K---- should have left the estate, and the young\r\ngentleman, the present owner, come down to look after the people.\r\n\r\nHe showed me his garden, from whence come the beautiful vegetables he had\r\nmore than once supplied me with; in the midst of it was a very fine and\r\nflourishing date palm tree, which he said bore its fruit as prosperously\r\nhere as it would in Asia. After the garden, we visited a charming\r\nnicely-kept poultry yard, and I returned home much delighted with my visit\r\nand the kind good humour of my host.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I sat as usual at the receipt of custom, hearing of\r\naches and pains, till I ached myself sympathetically from head to foot.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning, dear E----, I went on horseback to St. Annie's,\r\nexploring on my way some beautiful woods, and in the afternoon I returned\r\nthither in a wood waggon with Jack to drive and a mule to draw me,\r\nMontreal being quite beyond his management; and then and there, the\r\nhatchet and saw being in company, I compelled my slave Jack, all the\r\nrattlesnakes in creation to the contrary notwithstanding, to cut and clear\r\na way for my chariot through the charming copse.\r\n\r\nMy letter has been lying unfinished for the last three days. I have been\r\nextraordinarily busy, having emancipated myself from the trammels of Jack\r\nand all his terror, and as I fear no serpents on horseback, have been\r\ndaily riding through new patches of woodland without any guide, taking my\r\nchance of what I might come to in the shape of impediments. Last Tuesday,\r\nI rode through a whole wood, of burned and charred trees, cypresses and\r\noaks, that looked as if they had been each of them blasted by a special\r\nthunderbolt, and whole thickets of young trees and shrubs perfectly black\r\nand brittle from the effect of fire, I suppose the result of some\r\ncarelessness of the slaves. As this charcoal woodland extended for some\r\ndistance, I turned out of it, and round the main road through the\r\nplantation, as I could not ride through the blackened boughs and branches\r\nwithout getting begrimed. It had a strange wild desolate effect, not\r\nwithout a certain gloomy picturesqueness.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I made Israel drive me through Jack's new-made path to\r\nbreak it down and open it still more, and Montreal's powerful trampling\r\ndid good service to that effect, though he did not seem to relish the\r\nnarrow wood road with its grass path by any means as much as the open way\r\nof what may be called the high road. After this operation, I went on to\r\nvisit the people at the Busson Hill settlement. I here found, among other\r\nnoteworthy individuals, a female named Judy, whose two children belong to\r\nan individual called (not Punch) but Joe, who has another wife, called\r\nMary, at the Rice Island. In one of the huts I went to leave some flannel\r\nand rice and sugar for a poor old creature called Nancy, to whom I had\r\npromised such indulgences: she is exceedingly infirm and miserable,\r\nsuffering from sore limbs and an ulcerated leg so cruelly that she can\r\nhardly find rest in any position from the constant pain she endures, and\r\nis quite unable to lie on her hard bed at night. As I bent over her\r\nto-day, trying to prop her into some posture where she might find some\r\nease, she took hold of my hand, and with the tears streaming over her\r\nface, said, 'I have worked every day through dew and damp, and sand and\r\nheat, and done good work; but oh, missis, me old and broken now, no tongue\r\ncan tell how much I suffer.' In spite of their curious thick utterance and\r\ncomical jargon, these people sometimes use wonderfully striking and\r\npathetic forms of speech. In the next cabin, which consisted of an\r\nenclosure, called by courtesy a room, certainly not ten feet square, and\r\nowned by a woman called Dice--that is, not owned, of course, but inhabited\r\nby her--three grown up human beings and eight children stow themselves by\r\nday and night, which may be called close packing, I think. I presume that\r\nthey must take turns to be inside and outside the house, but they did not\r\nmake any complaint about it, though I should think the aspect of my\r\ncountenance, as I surveyed their abode and heard their numbers, might have\r\ngiven them a hint to that effect; but I really do find these poor\r\ncreatures patient of so much misery, that it inclines me the more to heed\r\nas well as hear their petitions and complaints, when they bring them to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAfter my return home, I had my usual evening reception, and, among other\r\npleasant incidents of plantation life, heard the following agreeable\r\nanecdote from a woman named Sophy, who came to beg for some rice. In\r\nasking her about her husband and children, she said she had never had any\r\nhusband, that she had had two children by a white man of the name of\r\nWalker, who was employed at the mill on the rice island; she was in the\r\nhospital after the birth of the second child she bore this man, and at the\r\nsame time two women, Judy and Sylla, of whose children Mr. K---- was the\r\nfather, were recovering from their confinements. It was not a month since\r\nany of them had been delivered, when Mrs. K---- came to the hospital, had\r\nthem all three severely flogged, a process which _she_ personally\r\nsuperintended, and then sent them to Five Pound--the swamp Botany Bay of\r\nthe plantation, of which I have told you--with further orders to the\r\ndrivers to flog them every day for a week. Now, E----, if I make you sick\r\nwith these disgusting stories, I cannot help it--they are the life itself\r\nhere; hitherto I have thought these details intolerable enough, but this\r\napparition of a female fiend in the middle of this hell I confess adds an\r\nelement of cruelty which seems to me to surpass all the rest. Jealousy is\r\nnot an uncommon quality in the feminine temperament; and just conceive the\r\nfate of these unfortunate women between the passions of their masters and\r\nmistresses, each alike armed with power to oppress and torture them. Sophy\r\nwent on to say that Isaac was her son by driver Morris, who had forced\r\nher while she was in her miserable exile at Five Pound. Almost beyond my\r\npatience with this string of detestable details, I exclaimed--foolishly\r\nenough, heaven knows--'Ah, but don't you know, did nobody ever tell or\r\nteach any of you, that it is a sin to live with men who are not your\r\nhusbands?' Alas, E----, what could the poor creature answer but what she\r\ndid, seizing me at the same time vehemently by the wrist: 'Oh yes, missis,\r\nwe know--we know all about dat well enough; but we do anything to get our\r\npoor flesh some rest from de whip; when he made me follow him into de\r\nbush, what use me tell him no? he have strength to make me.' I have\r\nwritten down the woman's words; I wish I could write down the voice and\r\nlook of abject misery with which they were spoken. Now, you will observe\r\nthat the story was not told to me as a complaint; it was a thing long past\r\nand over, of which she only spoke in the natural course of accounting for\r\nher children to me. I make no comment; what need, or can I add, to such\r\nstories? But how is such a state of things to endure?--and again, how is\r\nit to end? While I was pondering, as it seemed to me, at the very bottom\r\nof the Slough of Despond, on this miserable creature's story, another\r\nwoman came in (Tema), carrying in her arms a child the image of the\r\nmulatto Bran; she came to beg for flannel. I asked her who was her\r\nhusband. She said she was not married. Her child is the child of\r\nbricklayer Temple, who has a wife at the rice island. By this time, what\r\ndo you think of the moralities, as well as the amenities, of slave life?\r\nThese are the conditions which can only be known to one who lives among\r\nthem; flagrant acts of cruelty may be rare, but this ineffable state of\r\nutter degradation, this really _beastly_ existence, is the normal\r\ncondition of these men and women, and of that no one seems to take heed,\r\nnor have I ever heard it described so as to form any adequate conception\r\nof it, till I found myself plunged into it;--where and how is one to begin\r\nthe cleansing of this horrid pestilential immondezzio of an existence?\r\n\r\nIt is Wednesday, the 20th of March; we cannot stay here much longer; I\r\nwonder if I shall come back again! and whether, when I do, I shall find\r\nthe trace of one idea of a better life left in these poor people's minds\r\nby my sojourn among them.\r\n\r\nOne of my industries this morning has been cutting out another dress for\r\none of our women, who had heard of my tailoring prowess at the rice\r\nisland. The material, as usual, was a miserable cotton, many-coloured like\r\nthe scarf of Iris. While shaping it for my client, I ventured to suggest\r\nthe idea of the possibility of a change of the nethermost as well as the\r\nuppermost garment. This, I imagine, is a conception that has never dawned\r\nupon the female slave mind on this plantation. They receive twice a year a\r\ncertain supply of clothing, and wear them (as I have heard some nasty fine\r\nladies do their stays, for fear they should get out of shape), without\r\nwashing, till they receive the next suit. Under these circumstances I\r\nthink it is unphilosophical, to say the least of it, to speak of the\r\nnegroes as a race whose unfragrance is heaven-ordained, and the result of\r\nspecial organisation.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that I have been delighted, surprised, and the very least\r\nperplexed, by the sudden petition on the part of our young waiter, Aleck,\r\nthat I will teach him to read. He is a very intelligent lad of about\r\nsixteen, and preferred his request with an urgent humility that was very\r\ntouching. I told him I would think about it. I mean to do it. I will do\r\nit,--and yet, it is simply breaking the laws of the government under which\r\nI am living. Unrighteous laws are made to be broken,--_perhaps_,--but\r\nthen, you see, I am a woman, and Mr. ---- stands between me and the\r\npenalty. If I were a man, I would do that and many a thing besides, and\r\ndoubtless should be shot some fine day from behind a tree by some good\r\nneighbour, who would do the community a service by quietly getting rid of\r\na mischievous incendiary; and I promise you in such a case no questions\r\nwould be asked, and my lessons would come to a speedy and silent end; but\r\nteaching slaves to read is a fineable offence, and I am _feme couverte_,\r\nand my fines must be paid by my legal owner, and the first offence of the\r\nsort is heavily fined, and the second more heavily fined, and for the\r\nthird, one is sent to prison. What a pity it is I can't begin with\r\nAleck's third lesson, because going to prison can't be done by proxy, and\r\nthat penalty would light upon the right shoulders! I certainly intend to\r\nteach Aleck to read. I certainly won't tell Mr. ---- anything about it.\r\nI'll leave him to find it out, as slaves, and servants and children, and\r\nall oppressed, and ignorant, and uneducated and unprincipled people do;\r\nthen, if he forbids me I can stop--perhaps before then the lad may have\r\nlearnt his letters. I begin to perceive one most admirable circumstance in\r\nthis slavery: you are absolute on your own plantation. No slaves'\r\ntestimony avails against you, and no white testimony exists but such as\r\nyou choose to admit. Some owners have a fancy for maiming their slaves,\r\nsome brand them, some pull out their teeth, some shoot them a little here\r\nand there (all details gathered from advertisements of runaway slaves in\r\nsouthern papers); now they do all this on their plantations, where nobody\r\ncomes to see, and I'll teach Aleck to read, for nobody is here to see, at\r\nleast nobody whose seeing I mind; and I'll teach every other creature that\r\nwants to learn. I haven't much more than a week to remain in this blessed\r\npurgatory, in that last week perhaps I may teach the boy enough to go on\r\nalone when I am gone.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 21st._--I took a long ride to-day all through some new woods\r\nand fields, and finally came upon a large space sown with corn for the\r\npeople. Here I was accosted by such a shape as I never beheld in the worst\r\nof my dreams; it looked at first, as it came screaming towards me, like a\r\nlive specimen of the arms of the Isle of Man, which, as you may or may not\r\nknow, are three legs joined together, and kicking in different directions.\r\nThis uncouth device is not an invention of the Manxmen, for it is found on\r\nsome very ancient coins,--Greek, I believe; but at any rate it is now the\r\ndevice of our subject Island of Man, and, like that set in motion, and\r\nnothing else, was the object that approached me, only it had a head where\r\nthe three legs were joined, and a voice came out of the head to this\r\neffect, 'Oh missis, you hab to take me out of dis here bird field, me no\r\nable to run after birds, and ebery night me lick because me no run after\r\ndem.' When this apparition reached me and stood as still as it could, I\r\nperceived it consisted of a boy who said his name was 'Jack de bird\r\ndriver.' I suppose some vague idea of the fitness of things had induced\r\nthem to send this living scarecrow into the cornfield, and if he had been\r\nset up in the midst of it, nobody, I am sure, would have imagined he was\r\nanything else; but it seems he was expected to run after the feathered\r\nfowl who alighted on the grain field, and I do not wonder that he did not\r\nfulfil this expectation. His feet, legs, and knees were all maimed and\r\ndistorted, his legs were nowhere thicker than my wrist, his feet were a\r\nyard apart from each other, and his knees swollen and knocking together.\r\nWhat a creature to ran after birds! He implored me to give him some meat,\r\nand have him sent back to Little St. Simon's Island, from which he came,\r\nand where he said his poor limbs were stronger and better.\r\n\r\nRiding home, I passed some sassafras trees, which are putting forth\r\ndeliciously fragrant tassels of small leaves and blossoms, and other\r\nexquisite flowering shrubs, which are new to me, and enchant me perhaps\r\nall the more for their strangeness. Before reaching the house, I was\r\nstopped by one of our multitudinous Jennies, with a request for some meat,\r\nand that I would help her with some clothes for Ben and Daphne, of whom\r\nshe had the sole charge; these are two extremely pretty and\r\ninteresting-looking mulatto children, whose resemblance to Mr. K---- had\r\ninduced me to ask Mr. ----, when first I saw them, if he did not think\r\nthey must be his children? He said they were certainly like him, but Mr.\r\nK---- did not acknowledge the relationship. I asked Jenny who their mother\r\nwas. 'Minda.' 'Who their father?' 'Mr. K----.' 'What! old Mr. K----?' 'No,\r\nMr. R. K----.' 'Who told you so?' 'Minda, who ought to know.' 'Mr. K----\r\ndenies it.' 'That's because he never has looked upon them, nor done a\r\nthing for them.' 'Well, but he acknowledged Renty as his son, why should\r\nhe deny these?' 'Because old master was here then, when Renty was born,\r\nand he made Betty tell all about it, and Mr. K---- had to own it; but\r\nnobody knows anything about this, and so he denies it'--with which\r\ninformation I rode home. I always give you an exact report of any\r\nconversation I may have with any of the people, and you see from this that\r\nthe people on the plantation themselves are much of my worthy neighbour\r\nMr. C----'s mind, that the death of Major ---- was a great misfortune for\r\nthe slaves on his estate.\r\n\r\nI went to the hospital this afternoon, to see if the condition of the poor\r\npeople was at all improved since I had been last there; but nothing had\r\nbeen done. I suppose Mr. G---- is waiting for Mr. ---- to come down in\r\norder to speak to him about it. I found some miserable new cases of women\r\ndisabled by hard work. One poor thing, called Priscilla, had come out of\r\nthe fields to-day scarcely able to crawl; she has been losing blood for a\r\nwhole fortnight without intermission, and, until to-day, was labouring in\r\nthe fields. Leah, another new face since I visited the hospital last, is\r\nlying quite helpless from exhaustion; she is advanced in her pregnancy,\r\nand doing task work in the fields at the same time. What piteous\r\nexistences to be sure! I do wonder, as I walk among them, well fed, well\r\nclothed, young, strong, idle, doing nothing but ride and drive about all\r\nday, a woman, a creature like themselves, who have borne children too,\r\nwhat sort of feeling they have towards me. I wonder it is not one of\r\nmurderous hate--that they should lie here almost dying with unrepaid\r\nlabour for me. I stand and look at them, and these thoughts work in my\r\nmind and heart, till I feel as if I must tell them how dreadful and how\r\nmonstrous it seems to me myself, and how bitterly ashamed and grieved I\r\nfeel for it all.\r\n\r\nTo-day I rode in the morning round poor Cripple Jack's bird field again,\r\nthrough the sweet spicy-smelling pine land, and home by my new road cut\r\nthrough Jones's wood, of which I am as proud as if I had made instead of\r\nfound it--the grass, flowering shrubs, and all. In the afternoon, I drove\r\nin the wood wagon back to Jones's, and visited Busson Hill on the way,\r\nwith performances of certain promises of flannel, quarters of dollars, &c.\r\n&c. At Jones's, the women to-day had all done their work at a quarter past\r\nthree, and had swept their huts out very scrupulously for my reception.\r\nTheir dwellings are shockingly dilapidated and over-crammed--poor\r\ncreatures!--and it seems hard that, while exhorting them to spend labour\r\nin cleaning and making them tidy, I cannot promise them that they shall be\r\nrepaired and made habitable for them.\r\n\r\nIn driving home through my new wood cut, Jack gave me a terrible account\r\nof a flogging that a negro called Glasgow had received yesterday. He\r\nseemed awfully impressed with it; so I suppose it must have been an\r\nunusually severe punishment; but he either would not or could not tell me\r\nwhat the man had done. On my return to the house, I found Mr. ---- had\r\ncome down from the rice plantation, whereat I was much delighted on all\r\naccounts. I am sure it is getting much too late for him to remain in that\r\npestilential swampy atmosphere; besides I want him to see my improvements\r\nin the new wood paths, and I want him to come and hear all these poor\r\npeople's complaints and petitions himself. They have been flocking in to\r\nsee him ever since it was known he had arrived. I met coming on that\r\nerrand Dandy, the husband of the woman for whom I cut out the gown the\r\nother day; and asking him how it had answered, he gave a piteous account\r\nof its tearing all to pieces the first time she put it on; it had appeared\r\nto me perfectly rotten and good for nothing, and, upon questioning him as\r\nto where he bought it and what he paid for it, I had to hear a sad account\r\nof hardship and injustice. I have told you that the people collect moss\r\nfrom the trees and sell it to the shopkeepers in Darien for the purpose of\r\nstuffing furniture; they also raise poultry, and are allowed to dispose of\r\nthe eggs in the same way. It seems that poor Dandy had taken the miserable\r\nmaterial Edie's gown was made of as payment for a quantity of moss and\r\neggs furnished by him at various times to one of the Darien storekeepers,\r\nwho refused him payment in any other shape, and the poor fellow had no\r\nredress; and this, he tells me, is a frequent experience with all the\r\nslaves both here and at the rice island. Of course, the rascally\r\nshopkeepers can cheat these poor wretches to any extent they please with\r\nperfect impunity.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- told me of a visit Renty paid him, which was not a little curious\r\nin some of its particulars. You know none of the slaves are allowed the\r\nuse of fire arms; but Renty put up a petition to be allowed Mr. K----'s\r\ngun, which it seems that gentleman left behind him. Mr. ---- refused this\r\npetition, saying at the same time to the lad that he knew very well that\r\nnone of the people were allowed guns. Renty expostulated on the score of\r\nhis _white blood_, and finding his master uninfluenced by that\r\nconsideration, departed with some severe reflections on Mr. K----, his\r\nfather, for not having left him his gun as a keepsake, in token of\r\n(paternal) affection, when he left the plantation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite late, and I am very tired, though I have not done much more\r\nthan usual to-day, but the weather is beginning to be oppressive to me,\r\nwho hate heat; but I find the people, and especially the sick in the\r\nhospital, speak of it as cold. I will tell you hereafter of a most comical\r\naccount Mr. ---- has given me of the prolonged and still protracted\r\npseudo-pregnancy of a woman called Markie, who for many more months than\r\nare generally required for the process of continuing the human species,\r\npretended to be what the Germans pathetically and poetically call 'in good\r\nhope,' and continued to reap increased rations as the reward of her\r\nexpectation, till she finally had to disappoint the estate and receive a\r\nflogging.\r\n\r\nHe told me too, what interested me very much, of a conspiracy among Mr.\r\nC----'s slaves some years ago. I cannot tell you about it now; I will some\r\nother time. It is wonderful to me that such attempts are not being made\r\nthe whole time among these people to regain their liberty; probably\r\nbecause many are made ineffectually, and never known beyond the limits of\r\nthe plantation where they take place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. We have been having something like northern March\r\nweather--blinding sun, blinding wind, and blinding dust, through all\r\nwhich, the day before yesterday, Mr. ---- and I rode together round most\r\nof the fields, and over the greater part of the plantation. It was a\r\ndetestable process, the more so that he rode Montreal and I Miss Kate, and\r\nwe had no small difficulty in managing them both. In the afternoon we had\r\nan equally detestable drive through the new wood paths to St. Annie's, and\r\nhaving accomplished all my errands among the people there, we crossed over\r\ncertain sounds, and seas, and separating waters, to pay a neighbourly\r\nvisit to the wife of one of our adjacent planters.\r\n\r\nHow impossible it would be for you to conceive, even if I could describe,\r\nthe careless desolation which pervaded the whole place; the shaggy unkempt\r\ngrounds we passed through to approach the house; the ruinous, rackrent,\r\ntumble-down house itself, the untidy, slatternly all but beggarly\r\nappearance of the mistress of the mansion herself. The smallest Yankee\r\nfarmer has a tidier estate, a tidier house, and a tidier wife than this\r\nmember of the proud southern chivalry, who, however, inasmuch as he has\r\nslaves, is undoubtedly a much greater personage in his own estimation than\r\nthose capital fellows W---- and B----, who walk in glory and in joy behind\r\ntheir ploughs upon your mountain sides. The Brunswick canal project was\r\ndescanted upon, and pronounced, without a shadow of dissent, a scheme the\r\nimpracticability of which all but convicted its projectors of insanity.\r\nCertainly, if, as I hear the monied men of Boston have gone largely into\r\nthis speculation, their habitual sagacity must have been seriously at\r\nfault; for here on the spot nobody mentions the project but as a subject\r\nof utter derision.\r\n\r\nWhile the men discussed about this matter, Mrs. B---- favoured me with the\r\ncongratulations I have heard so many times on the subject of my having a\r\nwhite nursery maid for my children. Of course, she went into the old\r\nsubject of the utter incompetency of negro women to discharge such an\r\noffice faithfully; but in spite of her multiplied examples of their utter\r\ninefficiency, I believe the discussion ended by simply our both agreeing\r\nthat ignorant negro girls of twelve years old are not as capable or\r\ntrustworthy as well-trained white women of thirty.\r\n\r\nReturning home our route was changed, and Quash the boatman took us all\r\nthe way round by water to Hampton. I should have told you that our exit\r\nwas as wild as our entrance to this estate and was made through a broken\r\nwooden fence, which we had to climb partly over and partly under, with\r\nsome risk and some obloquy, in spite of our dexterity, as I tore my dress,\r\nand very nearly fell flat on my face in the process. Our row home was\r\nperfectly enchanting; for though the morning's wind and (I suppose) the\r\nstate of the tide had roughened the waters of the great river, and our\r\npassage was not as smooth as it might have been, the wind had died away,\r\nthe evening air was deliciously still, and mild, and soft. A young slip of\r\na moon glimmered just above the horizon, and 'the stars climbed up the\r\nsapphire steps of heaven,' while we made our way over the rolling,\r\nrushing, foaming waves, and saw to right and left the marsh fires burning\r\nin the swampy meadows, adding another coloured light in the landscape to\r\nthe amber-tinted lower sky and the violet arch above, and giving wild\r\npicturesqueness to the whole scene by throwing long flickering rays of\r\nflame upon the distant waters.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, the 14th._--I read service again to-day to the people. You cannot\r\nconceive anything more impressive than the silent devotion of their whole\r\ndemeanour while it lasted, nor more touching than the profound thanks with\r\nwhich they rewarded me when it was over, and they took their leave; and\r\nto-day they again left me with the utmost decorum of deportment, and\r\nwithout pressing a single petition or complaint, such as they ordinarily\r\nthrust upon me on all other occasions, which seems to me an instinctive\r\nfeeling of religious respect for the day and the business they have come\r\nupon, which does them infinite credit.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I took a long walk with the chicks in the woods; long at\r\nleast for the little legs of S---- and M----, who carried baby. We came\r\nhome by the shore, and I stopped to look at a jutting point, just below\r\nwhich a small sort of bay would have afforded the most capital position\r\nfor a bathing house. If we stayed here late in the season, such a\r\nrefreshment would become almost a necessary of life, and anywhere along\r\nthe bank just where I stopped to examine it to-day, an establishment for\r\nthat purpose might be prosperously founded.\r\n\r\nI am amused, but by no means pleased, at an entirely new mode of\r\npronouncing which S---- has adopted. Apparently the negro jargon has\r\ncommended itself as euphonious to her infantile ears, and she is now\r\ntreating me to the most ludicrous and accurate imitations of it every time\r\nshe opens her mouth. Of course I shall not allow this, comical as it is,\r\nto become a habit. This is the way the southern ladies acquire the thick\r\nand inelegant pronunciation which distinguishes their utterances from the\r\nnorthern snuffle; and I have no desire that S---- should adorn her mother\r\ntongue with either peculiarity. It is a curious and sad enough thing to\r\nobserve, as I have frequent opportunities of doing, the unbounded\r\ninsolence and tyranny (of manner, of course it can go no farther), of the\r\nslaves towards each other. 'Hi! you boy!' and 'Hi! you girl!' shouted in\r\nan imperious scream, is the civillest mode of apostrophising those at a\r\ndistance from them; more frequently it is 'You niggar, you hear? hi! you\r\nniggar!' And I assure you no contemptuous white intonation ever equalled\r\nthe _prepotenza_ of the despotic insolence of this address of these poor\r\nwretches to each other.\r\n\r\nI have left my letter lying for a couple of days, dear E----. I have been\r\nbusy and tired; my walking and riding is becoming rather more laborious to\r\nme, for, though nobody here appears to do so, I am beginning to feel the\r\nrelaxing influence of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday I took a disagreeable ride, all through swampy\r\nfields and charred blackened thickets, to discover nothing either\r\npicturesque or beautiful; the woods in one part of the plantation have\r\nbeen on fire for three days, and a whole tract of exquisite evergreens has\r\nbeen burnt down to the ground. In the afternoon I drove in the wood wagon\r\nto visit the people at St. Annie's. There had been rain these last two\r\nnights, and their wretched hovels do not keep out the weather; they are\r\nreally miserable abodes for human beings. I think pigs who were at all\r\nparticular might object to some of them. There is a woman at this\r\nsettlement called Sophy, the wife of a driver, Morris, who is so pretty\r\nthat I often wonder if it is only by contrast that I admire her so much,\r\nor if her gentle, sweet, refined face, in spite of its dusky colour, would\r\nnot approve itself anywhere to any one with an eye for beauty. Her manner\r\nand voice too are peculiarly soft and gentle; but, indeed, the voices of\r\nall these poor people, men as well as women, are much pleasanter and more\r\nmelodious than the voices of white people in general. Most of the wretched\r\nhovels had been swept and tidied out in expectation of my visit, and many\r\nwere the consequent petitions for rations of meat, flannel, osnaburgs,\r\netc. Promising all which, in due proportion to the cleanliness of each\r\nseparate dwelling, I came away. On my way home I called for a moment at\r\nJones' settlement to leave money and presents promised to the people\r\nthere, for similar improvement in the condition of their huts. I had not\r\ntime to stay and distribute my benefactions myself; and so appointed a\r\nparticularly bright intelligent looking woman, called Jenny, pay-mistress\r\nin my stead; and her deputed authority was received with the utmost\r\ncheerfulness by them all.\r\n\r\nI have been having a long talk with Mr. ---- about Ben and Daphne, those\r\ntwo young mulatto children of Mr. K----'s, whom I mentioned to you lately.\r\nPoor pretty children! they have refined and sensitive faces as well as\r\nstraight regular features; and the expression of the girl's countenance,\r\nas well as the sound of her voice, and the sad humility of her deportment,\r\nare indescribably touching. Mr. B---- expressed the strongest interest in\r\nand pity for them, _because of their colour_: it seems unjust almost to\r\nthe rest of their fellow unfortunates that this should be so, and yet it\r\nis almost impossible to resist the impression of the unfitness of these\r\ntwo forlorn young creatures, for the life of coarse labour and dreadful\r\ndegradation to which they are destined. In any of the southern cities the\r\ngirl would be pretty sure to be reserved for a worse fate; but even here,\r\ndeath seems to me a thousand times preferable to the life that is before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I rode with Mr. ---- to look at the fire in the woods. We\r\ndid not approach it, but stood where the great volumes of smoke could be\r\nseen rising steadily above the pines, as they have now continued to do for\r\nupwards of a week; the destruction of the pine timber must be something\r\nenormous. We then went to visit Dr. and Mrs. G----, and wound up these\r\nexercises of civilized life by a call on dear old Mr. C----, whose nursery\r\nand kitchen garden are a real refreshment to my spirits. How completely\r\nthe national character of the worthy canny old Scot is stamped on the care\r\nand thrift visible in his whole property, the judicious successful culture\r\nof which has improved and adorned his dwelling in this remote corner of\r\nthe earth! The comparison, or rather contrast, between himself and his\r\nquondam neighbour Major ----, is curious enough to contemplate. The Scotch\r\ntendency of the one to turn everything to good account, the Irish\r\npropensity of the other to leave everything to ruin, to disorder, and\r\nneglect; the careful economy and prudent management of the mercantile\r\nman, the reckless profusion, and careless extravagance of the soldier. The\r\none made a splendid fortune and spent it in Philadelphia, where he built\r\none of the finest houses that existed there, in the old-fashioned days,\r\nwhen fine old family mansions were still to be seen breaking the\r\nmonotonous uniformity of the Quaker city. The other has resided here on\r\nhis estate ameliorating the condition of his slaves and his property, a\r\nbenefactor to the people and the soil alike--a useful and a good\r\nexistence, an obscure and tranquil one.\r\n\r\nLast Wednesday we drove to Hamilton--by far the finest estate on St.\r\nSimon's Island. The gentleman to whom it belongs lives, I believe,\r\nhabitually in Paris; but Captain F---- resides on it, and, I suppose, is\r\nthe real overseer of the plantation. All the way along the road (we\r\ntraversed nearly the whole length of the island) we found great tracts of\r\nwood, all burnt or burning; the destruction had spread in every direction,\r\nand against the sky we saw the slow rising of the smoky clouds that showed\r\nthe pine forest to be on fire still. What an immense quantity of property\r\nsuch a fire must destroy! The negro huts on several of the plantations\r\nthat we passed through were the most miserable human habitations I ever\r\nbeheld. The wretched hovels at St. Annie's, on the Hampton estate, that\r\nhad seemed to me the _ne plus ultra_ of misery, were really palaces to\r\nsome of the dirty, desolate, dilapidated dog kennels which we passed\r\nto-day, and out of which the negroes poured like black ants at our\r\napproach, and stood to gaze at us as we drove by.\r\n\r\nThe planters' residences we passed were only three. It makes one ponder\r\nseriously when one thinks of the mere handful of white people on this\r\nisland. In the midst of this large population of slaves, how absolutely\r\nhelpless they would be if the blacks were to become restive! They could be\r\ndestroyed to a man before human help could reach them from the main, or\r\nthe tidings even of what was going on be carried across the surrounding\r\nwaters. As we approached the southern end of the island, we began to\r\ndiscover the line of the white sea sands beyond the bushes and\r\nfields,--and presently, above the sparkling, dazzling line of snowy\r\nwhite,--for the sands were as white as our English chalk\r\ncliffs,--stretched the deep blue sea line of the great Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nWe found that there had been a most terrible fire in the Hamilton\r\nwoods--more extensive than that on our own plantation. It seems as if the\r\nwhole island had been burning at different points for more than a week.\r\nWhat a cruel pity and shame it does seem to have these beautiful masses of\r\nwood so destroyed! I suppose it is impossible to prevent it. The 'field\r\nhands' make fires to cook their mid-day food wherever they happen to be\r\nworking; and sometimes through their careless neglect, but sometimes too\r\nundoubtedly on purpose, the woods are set fire to by these means. One\r\nbenefit they consider that they derive from the process is the destruction\r\nof the dreaded rattlesnakes that infest the woodland all over the island;\r\nbut really the funeral pyre of these hateful reptiles is too costly at\r\nthis price.\r\n\r\nHamilton struck me very much,--I mean the whole appearance of the place;\r\nthe situation of the house, the noble water prospect it commanded, the\r\nmagnificent old oaks near it, a luxuriant vine trellis, and a splendid\r\nhedge of Yucca gloriosa, were all objects of great delight to me. The\r\nlatter was most curious to me, who had never seen any but single specimens\r\nof the plant, and not many of these. I think our green house at the north\r\nboasts but two; but here they were growing close together, and in such a\r\nmanner as to form a compact and impenetrable hedge, their spiky leaves\r\nstriking out on all sides like _chevaux de frise_, and the tall slender\r\nstems that bear those delicate ivory-coloured bells of blossoms, springing\r\nup against the sky in a regular row. I wish I could see that hedge in\r\nblossom. It must be wonderfully strange and lovely, and must look by\r\nmoonlight like a whole range of fairy Chinese pagodas carved in ivory.\r\n\r\nAt dinner we had some delicious green peas, so much in advance of you are\r\nwe down here with the seasons. Don't you think one might accept the\r\nrattlesnakes, or perhaps indeed the slavery, for the sake of the green\r\npeas? 'Tis a world of compensations--a life of compromises, you know; and\r\none should learn to set one thing against another if one means to thrive\r\nand fare well, i.e. eat green peas on the twenty-eighth of March.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I walked up and down before the house for a long while with\r\nMrs. F----, and had a most interesting conversation with her about the\r\nnegroes and all the details of their condition. She is a kind-hearted,\r\nintelligent woman; but though she seemed to me to acquiesce, as a matter\r\nof inevitable necessity, in the social system in the midst of which she\r\nwas born and lives, she did not appear to me, by several things she\r\nsaid, to be by any means in love with it. She gave me a very sad\r\ncharacter of Mr. K----, confirming by her general description of him the\r\nimpression produced by all the details I have received from our own\r\npeople. As for any care for the moral or religious training of the\r\nslaves, that, she said, was a matter that never troubled his thoughts;\r\nindeed, his only notion upon the subject of religion, she said, was,\r\nthat it was something _not bad_ for white women and children.\r\n\r\nWe drove home by moonlight; and as we came towards the woods in the middle\r\nof the island, the fire-flies glittered out from the dusky thickets as if\r\nsome magical golden veil was every now and then shaken out into the\r\ndarkness. The air was enchantingly mild and soft, and the whole way\r\nthrough the silvery night delightful.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I have at length made acquaintance with a live\r\nrattlesnake. Old Scylla had the pleasure of discovering it while hunting\r\nfor some wood to burn. Israel captured it, and brought it to the house for\r\nmy edification. I thought it an evil-looking beast, and could not help\r\nfeeling rather nervous while contemplating it, though the poor thing had a\r\nnoose round its neck and could by no manner of means have extricated\r\nitself. The flat head, and vivid vicious eye, and darting tongue, were\r\nnone of them lovely to behold; but the sort of threatening whirr produced\r\nby its rattle, together with the deepening and fading of the marks on its\r\nskin, either with its respiration or the emotions of fear and anger it was\r\nenduring, were peculiarly dreadful and fascinating. It was quite a young\r\none, having only two or three rattles in its tail. These, as you probably\r\nknow, increase in number by one annually; so that you can always tell the\r\nage of the amiable serpent you are examining--if it will let you count the\r\nnumber of joints of its rattle. Captain F---- gave me the rattle of one\r\nwhich had as many as twelve joints. He said it had belonged to a very\r\nlarge snake which had crawled from under a fallen tree trunk on which his\r\nchildren were playing. After exhibiting his interesting captive, Israel\r\nkilled, stuffed, and presented it to me for preservation as a trophy, and\r\nmade me extremely happy by informing me that there was a nest of them\r\nwhere this one was found. I think with terror of S---- running about with\r\nher little socks not reaching half-way up her legs, and her little frocks\r\nnot reaching half-way down them. However, we shall probably not make\r\nacquaintance with many more of these natives of Georgia, as we are to\r\nreturn as soon as possible now to the north. We shall soon be free again.\r\n\r\nThis morning I rode to the burnt district, and attempted to go through it\r\nat St. Clair's, but unsuccessfully: it was impossible to penetrate through\r\nthe charred and blackened thickets. In the afternoon I walked round the\r\npoint, and visited the houses of the people who are our nearest\r\nneighbours. I found poor Edie in sad tribulation at the prospect of\r\nresuming her field labour. It is really shameful treatment of a woman just\r\nafter child labour. She was confined exactly three weeks ago to-day, and\r\nshe tells me she is ordered out to field work on Monday. She seems to\r\ndread the approaching hardships of her task-labour extremely. Her baby was\r\nborn dead, she thinks in consequence of a fall she had while carrying a\r\nheavy weight of water. She is suffering great pain in one of her legs and\r\nsides, and seems to me in a condition utterly unfit for any work, much\r\nless hoeing in the fields; but I dare not interfere to prevent this\r\ncruelty. She says she has already had to go out to work three weeks after\r\nher confinement with each of her other children, and does not complain of\r\nit as anything special in her case. She says that is now the invariable\r\nrule of the whole plantation, though it used not to be so formerly.\r\n\r\nI have let my letter lie since I wrote the above, dear E----; but as mine\r\nis a story without beginning, middle, or end, it matters extremely little\r\nwhere I leave it off or where I take it up; and if you have not, between\r\nmy wood rides and sick slaves, come to Falstaff's conclusion that I have\r\n'damnable iteration,' you are patient of sameness. But the days are like\r\neach other; and the rides and the people, and, alas! their conditions, do\r\nnot vary.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, my visit to the infirmary was marked by an event which\r\nhas not occurred before--the death of one of the poor slaves while I was\r\nthere. I found on entering the first ward,--to use a most inapplicable\r\nterm for the dark, filthy, forlorn room I have so christened,--an old\r\nnegro called Friday lying on the ground. I asked what ailed him, and was\r\ntold he was dying. I approached him, and perceived, from the glazed eyes\r\nand the feeble rattling breath, that he was at the point of expiring.\r\nHis tattered shirt and trousers barely covered his poor body; his\r\nappearance was that of utter exhaustion from age and feebleness; he had\r\nnothing under him but a mere handful of straw that did not cover the\r\nearth he was stretched on; and under his head, by way of pillow for his\r\ndying agony, two or three rough sticks just raising his skull a few\r\ninches from the ground. The flies were all gathering around his mouth,\r\nand not a creature was near him. There he lay,--the worn-out slave,\r\nwhose life had been spent in unrequited labour for me and mine,--without\r\none physical alleviation, one Christian solace, one human sympathy, to\r\ncheer him in his extremity,--panting out the last breath of his wretched\r\nexistence, like some forsaken, over-worked, wearied-out beast of\r\nburthen, rotting where it falls! I bent over the poor awful human\r\ncreature in the supreme hour of his mortality; and while my eyes,\r\nblinded with tears of unavailing pity and horror, were fixed upon him,\r\nthere was a sudden quivering of the eyelids and falling of the jaw,--and\r\nhe was free. I stood up, and remained long lost in the imagination of\r\nthe change that creature had undergone, and in the tremendous\r\noverwhelming consciousness of the deliverance God had granted the soul\r\nwhose cast-off vesture of decay lay at my feet. How I rejoiced for\r\nhim--and how, as I turned to the wretches who were calling to me from\r\nthe inner room, whence they could see me as I stood contemplating the\r\npiteous object, I wished they all were gone away with him, the\r\ndelivered, the freed by death from bitter bitter bondage. In the next\r\nroom, I found a miserable, decrepid, old negress, called Charity, lying\r\nsick, and I should think near too to die; but she did not think her work\r\nwas over, much as she looked unfit for further work on earth; but with\r\nfeeble voice and beseeching hands implored me to have her work lightened\r\nwhen she was sent back to it from the hospital. She is one of the oldest\r\nslaves on the plantation, and has to walk to her field labour, and back\r\nagain at night, a distance of nearly four miles. There were an unusual\r\nnumber of sick women in the room to-day; among them quite a young girl,\r\ndaughter of Boatman Quash's, with a sick baby, who has a father, though\r\nshe has no husband. Poor thing! she looks like a mere child herself. I\r\nreturned home so very sad and heart-sick that I could not rouse myself\r\nto the effort of going up to St. Annie's with the presents I had\r\npromised the people there. I sent M---- up in the wood wagon with them,\r\nand remained in the house with my thoughts, which were none of the\r\nmerriest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest E----. On Friday, I rode to where the rattlesnake was found, and\r\nwhere I was informed by the negroes there was a _nest_ of them--a pleasing\r\ndomestic picture of home and infancy that word suggests, not altogether\r\nappropriate to rattlesnakes, I think. On horseback I felt bold to\r\naccomplish this adventure, which I certainly should not have attempted on\r\nfoot; however, I could discover no sign of either snake or nest--(perhaps\r\nit is of the nature of a mare's nest, and undiscoverable); but, having\r\ndone my duty by myself in endeavouring to find it, I rode off and coasted\r\nthe estate by the side of the marsh, till I came to the causeway. There I\r\nfound a new cleared field, and stopped to admire the beautiful appearance\r\nof the stumps of the trees scattered all about it, and wreathed and\r\ngarlanded with the most profuse and fantastic growth of various\r\nplants--wild roses being among the most abundant. What a lovely aspect one\r\nside of nature presents here, and how hideous is the other!\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I drove to pay a visit to old Mrs. A----, the lady\r\nproprietress whose estate immediately adjoins ours. On my way thither, I\r\npassed a woman called Margaret walking rapidly and powerfully along the\r\nroad. She was returning home from the field, having done her task at three\r\no'clock; and told me, with a merry beaming black face, that she was going\r\n'to clean up de house, to please de missis.' On driving through my\r\nneighbour's grounds, I was disgusted more than I can express with the\r\nmiserable negro huts of her people; they were not fit to shelter\r\ncattle--they were not fit to shelter anything, for they were literally in\r\nholes, and, as we used to say of our stockings at school, too bad to darn.\r\nTo be sure, I will say, in excuse for their old mistress, her own\r\nhabitation was but a very few degrees less ruinous and disgusting. What\r\nwould one of your Yankee farmers say to such abodes? When I think of the\r\nwhite houses, the green blinds, and the flower plots, of the villages in\r\nNew England, and look at these dwellings of lazy filth and inert\r\ndegradation, it does seem amazing to think that physical and moral\r\nconditions so widely opposite should be found among people occupying a\r\nsimilar place in the social scale of the same country. The Northern\r\nfarmer, however, thinks it no shame to work, the Southern planter does;\r\nand there begins and ends the difference. Industry, man's crown of honour\r\nelsewhere, is here his badge of utter degradation; and so comes all by\r\nwhich I am here surrounded--pride, profligacy, idleness, cruelty,\r\ncowardice, ignorance, squalor, dirt, and ineffable abasement.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home, I found that Mrs. F---- had sent me some magnificent\r\nprawns. I think of having them served singly, and divided as one does a\r\nlobster--their size really suggests no less respect.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 31st._--I rode all through the burnt district and the bush to\r\nMrs. W----'s field, in making my way out of which I was very nearly\r\nswamped, and, but for the valuable assistance of a certain sable Scipio\r\nwho came up and extricated me, I might be floundering hopelessly there\r\nstill. He got me out of my Slough of Despond, and put me in the way to a\r\ncharming wood ride which runs between Mrs. W----'s and Colonel H----'s\r\ngrounds. While going along this delightful boundary of these two\r\nneighbouring estates, my mind not unnaturally dwelt upon the terms of\r\ndeadly feud in which the two families owning them are living with each\r\nother. A horrible quarrel has occurred quite lately upon the subject of\r\nthe ownership of this very ground I was skirting, between Dr. H---- and\r\nyoung Mr. W----; they have challenged each other, and what I am going to\r\ntell you is a good sample of the sort of spirit which grows up among\r\nslaveholders. So read it, for it is curious to people who have not lived\r\nhabitually among savages. The terms of the challenge that has passed\r\nbetween them have appeared like a sort of advertisement in the local\r\npaper, and are to the effect that they are to fight at a certain distance\r\nwith certain weapons--firearms, of course; that there is to be on the\r\nperson of each a white paper, or mark, immediately over the region of the\r\nheart, as a point for direct aim; and whoever kills the other is to have\r\nthe privilege of _cutting off his head, and sticking it up on a pole on\r\nthe piece of land which was the origin of the debate_; so that, some fine\r\nday, I might have come hither as I did to-day and found myself riding\r\nunder the shadow of the gory locks of Dr. H---- or Mr. W----, my peaceful\r\nand pleasant neighbours.\r\n\r\nI came home through our own pine woods, which are actually a wilderness\r\nof black desolation. The scorched and charred tree trunks are still\r\nsmoking and smouldering; the ground is a sort of charcoal pavement, and\r\nthe fire is still burning on all sides, for the smoke was rapidly rising\r\nin several directions on each hand of the path I pursued. Across this\r\ndismal scene of strange destruction, bright blue and red birds, like\r\nliving jewels, darted in the brilliant sunshine. I wonder if the fire\r\nhas killed and scared away many of these beautiful creatures. In the\r\nafternoon I took Jack with me to clear some more of the wood paths; but\r\nthe weather is what I call hot, and what the people here think warm, and\r\nthe air was literally thick with little black points of insects, which\r\nthey call sand flies, and which settle upon one's head and face\r\nliterally like a black net; you hardly see them or feel them at the\r\ntime, but the irritation occasioned by them is intolerable, and I had to\r\nrelinquish my work and fly before this winged plague as fast as I could\r\nfrom my new acquaintance the rattlesnakes. Jack informed me, in the\r\ncourse of our expedition, that the woods on the island were sometimes\r\nburnt away in order to leave the ground in grass for fodder for the\r\ncattle, and that the very beautiful ones he and I had been clearing\r\npaths through were not unlikely to be so doomed, which strikes me as a\r\nhorrible idea.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, poor Edie came up to the house to see me, with an old\r\nnegress called Sackey, who has been one of the chief nurses on the island\r\nfor many years. I suppose she has made some application to Mr. G---- for a\r\nrespite for Edie, on finding how terribly unfit she is for work; or\r\nperhaps Mr. ----, to whom I represented her case, may have ordered her\r\nreprieve; but she came with much gratitude to me (who have, as far as I\r\nknow, had nothing to do with it), to tell me that she is not able to be\r\nsent into the field for another week. Old Sackey fully confirmed Edie's\r\naccount of the terrible hardships the women underwent in being thus driven\r\nto labour before they had recovered from child-bearing. She said that old\r\nMajor ---- allowed the women at the rice island five weeks, and those here\r\nfour weeks, to recover from a confinement, and then never permitted them\r\nfor some time after they resumed their work to labour in the fields before\r\nsunrise or after sunset; but Mr. K---- had altered that arrangement,\r\nallowing the women at the rice island only four weeks, and those here only\r\nthree weeks, for their recovery; 'and then, missis,' continued the old\r\nwoman, 'out into the field again, through dew and dry, as if nothing had\r\nhappened; that is why, missis, so many of the women have falling of the\r\nwomb, and weakness in the back; and if he had continued on the estate, he\r\nwould have utterly destroyed all the breeding women.' Sometimes, after\r\nsending them back into the field, at the expiration of their three weeks,\r\nthey would work for a day or two, she said, and then fall down in the\r\nfield with exhaustion, and be brought to the hospital almost at the point\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nYesterday, Sunday, I had my last service at home with these poor people;\r\nnearly thirty of them came, all clean, neat, and decent, in their dress\r\nand appearance. S---- had begged very hard to join the congregation, and\r\nupon the most solemn promise of remaining still she was admitted; but in\r\nspite of the perfect honour with which she kept her promise, her presence\r\ndisturbed my thoughts not a little, and added much to the poignancy of the\r\nfeeling with which I saw her father's poor slaves gathered round me. The\r\nchild's exquisite complexion, large grey eyes, and solemn and at the same\r\ntime eager countenance, was such a wonderful piece of contrast to their\r\nsable faces, so many of them so uncouth in their outlines and proportions,\r\nand yet all of them so pathetic, and some so sublime in their expression\r\nof patient suffering and religious fervour; their eyes never wandered from\r\nme and my child, who sat close by my knee, their little mistress, their\r\nfuture providence, my poor baby! Dear E----, bless God that you have never\r\nreared a child with such an awful expectation: and at the end of the\r\nprayers, the tears were streaming over their faces, and one chorus of\r\nblessings rose round me and the child--farewell blessings, and prayers\r\nthat we would return; and thanks so fervent in their incoherency, it was\r\nmore than I could bear, and I begged them to go away and leave me to\r\nrecover myself. And then I remained with S----, and for quite a long while\r\neven her restless spirit was still in wondering amazement at my bitter\r\ncrying. I am to go next Sunday to the church on the island, where there is\r\nto be service; and so this is my last Sunday with the people.\r\n\r\nWhen I had recovered from the emotion of this scene, I walked out with\r\nS---- a little way, but meeting M---- and the baby, she turned home with\r\nthem, and I pursued my walk alone up the road, and home by the shore. They\r\nare threatening to burn down all my woods to make grass land for the\r\ncattle, and I have terrified them by telling them that I will never come\r\nback if they destroy the woods. I went and paid a visit to Mrs. G----;\r\npoor little, well-meaning, helpless woman! what can she do for these poor\r\npeople, where I who am supposed to own them can do nothing? and yet how\r\nmuch may be done, is done, by the brain and heart of one human being in\r\ncontact with another! We are answerable for incalculable opportunities of\r\ngood and evil in our daily intercourse with every soul with whom we have\r\nto deal; every meeting, every parting, every chance greeting, and every\r\nappointed encounter, are occasions open to us for which we are to account.\r\nTo our children, our servants, our friends, our acquaintances,--to each\r\nand all every day, and all day long, we are distributing that which is\r\nbest or worst in existence,--influence: with every word, with every look,\r\nwith every gesture, something is given or withheld of great importance it\r\nmay be to the receiver, of inestimable importance to the giver.\r\n\r\nCertainly the laws and enacted statutes on which this detestable system is\r\nbuilt up are potent enough; the social prejudice that buttresses it is\r\nalmost more potent still; and yet a few hearts and brains well bent to do\r\nthe work, would bring within this almost impenetrable dungeon of\r\nignorance, misery, and degradation, in which so many millions of human\r\nsouls lie buried, that freedom of God which would presently conquer for\r\nthem their earthly liberty. With some such thoughts I commended the\r\nslaves on the plantation to the little overseer's wife; I did not tell my\r\nthoughts to her, they would have scared the poor little woman half out of\r\nher senses. To begin with, her bread, her husband's occupation, has its\r\nroot in slavery; it would be difficult for her to think as I do of it. I\r\nam afraid her care, even of the bodily habits and sicknesses of the people\r\nleft in Mrs. G----'s charge, will not be worth much, for nobody treats\r\nothers better than they do themselves; and she is certainly doing her best\r\nto injure herself and her own poor baby, who is two and a-half years old,\r\nand whom she is still suckling.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, the worst case of this extraordinary delusion so\r\nprevalent among your women that I have ever met with yet; but they all\r\nnurse their children much longer than is good for either baby or mother.\r\nThe summer heat, particularly when a young baby is cutting teeth, is, I\r\nknow, considered by young American mothers an exceedingly critical time,\r\nand therefore I always hear of babies being nursed till after the second\r\nsummer; so that a child born in January would be suckled till it was\r\neighteen or nineteen months old, in order that it might not be weaned till\r\nits second summer was over. I am sure that nothing can be worse than this\r\nsystem, and I attribute much of the wretched ill health of young American\r\nmothers to over nursing; and of course a process that destroys their\r\nhealth and vigour completely must affect most unfavourably the child they\r\nare suckling. It is a grievous mistake. I remember my charming friend\r\nF---- D---- telling me that she had nursed her first child till her second\r\nwas born--a miraculous statement, which I can only believe because she\r\ntold it me herself. Whenever anything seems absolutely impossible, the\r\nword of a true person is the only proof of it worth anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. I have been riding into the swamp behind the new house; I had\r\na mind to survey the ground all round it before going away, to see what\r\ncapabilities it afforded for the founding of a garden, but I confess it\r\nlooked very unpromising. Trying to return by another way, I came to a\r\nmorass, which, after contemplating, and making my horse try for a few\r\npaces, I thought it expedient not to attempt. A woman called Charlotte,\r\nwho was working in the field, seeing my dilemma and the inglorious retreat\r\nI was about to make, shouted to me at the top of her voice, 'You no turn\r\nback, missis! if you want to go through, send, missis, send! you hab slave\r\nenough, nigger enough, let 'em come, let 'em fetch planks, and make de\r\nbridge; what you say dey must do,--send, missis, send, missis!' It seemed\r\nto me, from the lady's imperative tone in my behalf, that if she had been\r\nin my place, she would presently have had a corduroy road through the\r\nswamp of prostrate 'niggers,' as she called her family in Ham, and ridden\r\nover the same dry-hoofed; and to be sure, if I pleased, so might I, for,\r\nas she very truly said, 'what you say, missis, they must do.' Instead of\r\nsummoning her sooty tribe, however, I backed my horse out of the swamp,\r\nand betook myself to another pretty woodpath, which only wants widening to\r\nbe quite charming. At the end of this, however, I found swamp the second,\r\nand out of this having been helped by a grinning facetious personage, most\r\nappropriately named Pun, I returned home in dudgeon, in spite of what dear\r\nMiss M---- calls the 'moral suitability' of finding a foul bog at the end\r\nof every charming wood path or forest ride in this region.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I drove to Busson Hill, to visit the people there. I\r\nfound that both the men and women had done their work at half-past three.\r\nSaw Jema with her child, that ridiculous image of Driver Bran, in her\r\narms, in spite of whose whitey brown skin she still maintains that its\r\nfather is a man as black as herself--and she (to use a most extraordinary\r\ncomparison I heard of a negro girl making with regard to her mother) is as\r\nblack as 'de hinges of hell.' Query: Did she really mean hinges--or\r\nangels? The angels of hell is a polite and pretty paraphrase for devils,\r\ncertainly. In complimenting a woman, called Joan, upon the tidy condition\r\nof her house, she answered, with that cruel humility that is so bad an\r\nelement in their character, 'Missis no 'spect to find coloured folks'\r\nhouse clean as white folks.' The mode in which they have learned to accept\r\nthe idea of their own degradation and unalterable inferiority, is the most\r\nserious impediment that I see in the way of their progress, since\r\nassuredly, 'self-love is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.' In the\r\nsame way yesterday, Abraham the cook, in speaking of his brother's theft\r\nat the rice island, said 'it was a shame even for a coloured man to do\r\nsuch things.' I labour hard, whenever any such observation is made, to\r\nexplain to them that the question is one of moral and mental culture,--not\r\nthe colour of an integument,--and assure them, much to my own comfort,\r\nwhatever it may be to theirs, that white people are as dirty and as\r\ndishonest as coloured folks, when they have suffered the same lack of\r\ndecent training. If I could but find one of these women, on whose mind the\r\nidea had dawned that she was neither more nor less than my equal, I think\r\nI should embrace her in an ecstacy of hopefulness.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, while I was inditing my journal for your edification, Jema\r\nmade her appearance with her Bran-brown baby, having walked all the way\r\ndown from Busson Hill to claim a little sugar I had promised her. She had\r\nmade her child perfectly clean, and it looked quite pretty. When I asked\r\nher what I should give her the sugar in, she snatched her filthy\r\nhandkerchief off her head; but I declined this sugar basin, and gave it\r\nto her in some paper. Hannah came on the same errand.\r\n\r\nAfter all, dear E----, we shall not leave Georgia so soon as I expected;\r\nwe cannot get off for at least another week. You know, our movements are\r\napt to be both tardy and uncertain. I am getting sick in spirit of my stay\r\nhere; but I think the spring heat is beginning to affect me miserably, and\r\nI long for a cooler atmosphere. Here, on St. Simon's, the climate is\r\nperfectly healthy, and our neighbours, many of them, never stir from their\r\nplantations within reach of the purifying sea influence. But a land that\r\ngrows magnolias is not fit for me--I was going to say magnolias and\r\nrattlesnakes; but I remember K----'s adventure with her friend the\r\nrattlesnake of Monument Mountain, and the wild wood-covered hill half-way\r\nbetween Lenox and Stockbridge, which your Berkshire farmers have\r\nchristened Rattlesnake Mountain. These agreeable serpents seem, like the\r\nlovely little humming birds which are found in your northernmost as well\r\nas southernmost States, to have an accommodating disposition with regard\r\nto climate.\r\n\r\nNot only is the vicinity of the sea an element of salubrity here; but the\r\ngreat masses of pine wood growing in every direction indicate lightness of\r\nsoil and purity of air. Wherever these fragrant, dry, aromatic fir forests\r\nextend, there can be no inherent malaria, I should think, in either\r\natmosphere or soil. The beauty and profusion of the weeds and wild\r\nflowers in the fields now is something, too, enchanting. I wish I could\r\nspread one of these enamelled tracts on the side of one of your\r\nsnow-covered hills now--for I daresay they are snow-covered yet.\r\n\r\nI must give you an account of Aleck's first reading lesson, which took\r\nplace at the same time that I gave S---- hers this morning. It was the\r\nfirst time he had had leisure to come, and it went off most successfully.\r\nHe seems to me by no means stupid. I am very sorry he did not ask me to do\r\nthis before; however, if he can master his alphabet before I go, he may,\r\nif chance favour him with the occasional sight of a book, help himself on\r\nby degrees. Perhaps he will have the good inspiration to apply to Cooper\r\nLondon for assistance; I am much mistaken if that worthy does not contrive\r\nthat Heaven shall help Aleck, as it formerly did him--in the matter of\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nI rode with Jack afterwards, showing him where I wish paths to be cut\r\nand brushwood removed. I passed the new house, and again circumvented it\r\nmeditatingly to discover its available points of possible future\r\ncomeliness, but remained as convinced as ever that there are absolutely\r\nnone. Within the last two days, a perfect border of the dark blue\r\nVirginicum has burst into blossom on each side of the road, fringing it\r\nwith purple as far as one can look along it; it is lovely. I must tell\r\nyou of something which has delighted me greatly. I told Jack yesterday,\r\nthat if any of the boys liked, when they had done their tasks, to come\r\nand clear the paths that I want widened and trimmed, I would pay them a\r\ncertain small sum per hour for their labour; and behold, three boys have\r\ncome, having done their tasks early in the afternoon, to apply for\r\n_work_ and _wages_: so much for a suggestion not barely twenty-four\r\nhours old, and so much for a prospect of compensation!\r\n\r\nIn the evenings I attempted to walk out when the air was cool, but had to\r\nrun precipitately back into the house to escape from the clouds of\r\nsand-flies that had settled on my neck and arms. The weather has suddenly\r\nbecome intensely hot; at least, that is what it appears to me. After I had\r\ncome in I had a visit from Venus and her daughter, a young girl of ten\r\nyears old, for whom she begged a larger allowance of food as, she said,\r\nwhat she received for her was totally inadequate to the girl's proper\r\nnourishment. I was amazed, upon enquiry, to find that three quarts of\r\ngrits a week--that is not a pint a day--was considered a sufficient supply\r\nfor children of her age. The mother said her child was half-famished on\r\nit, and it seemed to me terribly little.\r\n\r\nMy little workmen have brought me in from the woods three darling little\r\nrabbits which they have contrived to catch. They seemed to me slightly\r\ndifferent from our English bunnies; and Captain F----, who called to-day,\r\ngave me a long account of how they differed from the same animal in the\r\nnorthern States. I did not like to mortify my small workmen by refusing\r\ntheir present; but the poor little things must be left to run wild again,\r\nfor we have no conveniences for pets here, besides we are just weighing\r\nanchor ourselves. I hope these poor little fluffy things will not meet any\r\nrattlesnakes on their way back to the woods.\r\n\r\nI had a visit for flannel from one of our Dianas to-day,--who had done her\r\ntask in the middle of the day, yet came to receive her flannel,--the most\r\nhorribly dirty human creature I ever beheld, unless indeed her child, whom\r\nshe brought with her, may have been half a degree dirtier.\r\n\r\nThe other day, Psyche (you remember the pretty under nurse, the poor thing\r\nwhose story I wrote you from the rice plantation) asked me if her mother\r\nand brothers might be allowed to come and see her when we are gone away. I\r\nasked her some questions about them, and she told me that one of her\r\nbrothers, who belonged to Mr. K----, was hired by that gentleman to a Mr.\r\nG---- of Darien, and that, upon the latter desiring to purchase him, Mr.\r\nK---- had sold the man without apprising him or any one member of his\r\nfamily that he had done so--a humane proceeding that makes one's blood\r\nboil when one hears of it. He had owned the man ever since he was a boy.\r\nPsyche urged me very much to obtain an order permitting her to see her\r\nmother and brothers. I will try and obtain it for her, but there seems\r\ngenerally a great objection to the visits of slaves from neighbouring\r\nplantations, and, I have no doubt, not without sufficient reason. The more\r\nI see of this frightful and perilous social system, the more I feel that\r\nthose who live in the midst of it must make their whole existence one\r\nconstant precaution against danger of some sort or other.\r\n\r\nI have given Aleck a second reading lesson with S----, who takes an\r\nextreme interest in his newly acquired alphabetical lore. He is a very\r\nquick and attentive scholar, and I should think a very short time would\r\nsuffice to teach him to read; but, alas! I have not even that short time.\r\nWhen I had done with my class, I rode off with Jack, who has become quite\r\nan expert horseman, and rejoices in being lifted out of the immediate\r\nregion of snakes by the length of his horse's legs. I cantered through the\r\nnew wood paths, and took a good sloping gallop through the pine land to\r\nSt. Annie's. The fire is actually still burning in the woods. I came home\r\nquite tired with the heat, though my ride was not a long one.\r\n\r\nJust as I had taken off my habit and was preparing to start off with\r\nM----and the chicks for Jones's, in the wood wagon, old Dorcas, one of\r\nthe most decrepid, rheumatic, and miserable old negresses from the\r\nfurther end of the plantation, called in to beg for some sugar. She had\r\nwalked the whole way from her own settlement, and seemed absolutely\r\nexhausted then, and yet she had to walk all the way back. It was not\r\notherwise than slightly meritorious in me, my dear E----, to take her up\r\nin the wagon and endure her abominable dirt and foulness in the closest\r\nproximity, rather than let her drag her poor old limbs all that way\r\nback; but I was glad when we gained her abode and lost her company. I am\r\nmightily reminded occasionally in these parts of Trinculo's soliloquy\r\nover Caliban. The people at Jones's had done their work at half-past\r\nthree. Most of the houses were tidy and clean, so were many of the\r\nbabies. On visiting the cabin of an exceedingly decent woman called\r\nPeggy, I found her, to my surprise, possessed of a fine large bible. She\r\ntold me her husband, Carpenter John, can read, and that she means to\r\nmake him teach her. The fame of Aleck's literature has evidently reached\r\nJones's, and they are not afraid to tell me that they can read or wish\r\nto learn to do so. This poor woman's health is miserable; I never saw a\r\nmore weakly sickly looking creature. She says she has been broken down\r\never since the birth of her last child. I asked her how soon after her\r\nconfinement she went out into the field to work again. She answered very\r\nquietly, but with a deep sigh: 'Three weeks, missis; de usual time.' As\r\nI was going away, a man named Martin came up, and with great vehemence\r\nbesought me to give him a prayer-book. In the evening, he came down to\r\nfetch it, and to show me that he can read. I was very much pleased to\r\nsee that they had taken my hint about nailing wooden slats across the\r\nwindows of their poor huts, to prevent the constant ingress of the\r\npoultry. This in itself will produce an immense difference in the\r\ncleanliness and comfort of their wretched abodes. In one of the huts I\r\nfound a broken looking-glass; it was the only piece of furniture of the\r\nsort that I had yet seen among them. The woman who owned it was, I am\r\nsorry to say, peculiarly untidy and dirty, and so were her children: so\r\nthat I felt rather inclined to scoff at the piece of civilized vanity,\r\nwhich I should otherwise have greeted as a promising sign.\r\n\r\nI drove home, late in the afternoon, through the sweet-smelling woods,\r\nthat are beginning to hum with the voice of thousands of insects. My troop\r\nof volunteer workmen is increased to five; five lads working for my wages\r\nafter they have done their task work; and this evening, to my no small\r\namazement, Driver Bran came down to join them for an hour, after working\r\nall day at Five Pound, which certainly shows zeal and energy.\r\n\r\nDear E----, I have been riding through the woods all the morning with\r\nJack, giving him directions about the clearings, which I have some faint\r\nhope may be allowed to continue after my departure. I went on an exploring\r\nexpedition round some distant fields, and then home through the St.\r\nAnnie's woods. They have almost stripped the trees and thickets along the\r\nswamp road since I first came here. I wonder what it is for: not fuel\r\nsurely, nor to make grass land of, or otherwise cultivate the swamp. I do\r\ndeplore these pitiless clearings; and as to this once pretty road, it\r\nlooks 'forlorn,' as a worthy Pennsylvania farmer's wife once said to me of\r\na pretty hill-side from which her husband had ruthlessly felled a\r\nbeautiful grove of trees.\r\n\r\nI had another snake encounter in my ride this morning. Just as I had\r\nwalked my horse through the swamp, and while contemplating ruefully its\r\nnaked aspect, a huge black snake wriggled rapidly across the path, and I\r\npulled my reins tight and opened my mouth wide with horror. These\r\nhideous-looking creatures are, I believe, not poisonous, but they grow to\r\na monstrous size, and have tremendous _constrictive_ power. I have heard\r\nstories that sound like the nightmare, of their fighting desperately with\r\nthose deadly creatures, rattlesnakes. I cannot conceive, if the black\r\nsnakes are not poisonous, what chance they have against such antagonists,\r\nlet their squeezing powers be what they will. How horrid it did look,\r\n_slithering_ over the road! Perhaps the swamp has been cleared on account\r\nof its harbouring these dreadful worms.\r\n\r\nI rode home very fast, in spite of the exquisite fragrance of the wild\r\ncherry blossoms, the carpets and curtains of wild flowers, among which a\r\nsort of glorified dandelion glowed conspicuously; dandelions such as I\r\nshould think grew in the garden of Eden, if there were any at all there. I\r\npassed the finest magnolia that I have yet seen; it was magnificent, and\r\nI suppose had been spared for its beauty, for it grew in the very middle\r\nof a cotton field; it was as large as a fine forest tree, and its huge\r\nglittering leaves shone like plates of metal in the sun; what a spectacle\r\nthat tree must be in blossom, and I should think its perfume must be smelt\r\nfrom one end of the plantation to the other. What a glorious creature!\r\nWhich do you think ought to weigh most in the scale, the delight of such a\r\nvegetable, or the disgust of the black animal I had just met a few minutes\r\nbefore? Would you take the one with the other? Neither would I.\r\n\r\nI have spent the whole afternoon at home; my 'gang' is busily at work\r\nagain. Sawney, one of them, came to join it nearly at sun-down, not having\r\ngot through his day's task before. In watching and listening to these\r\nlads, I was constantly struck with the insolent tyranny of their demeanour\r\ntowards each other. This is almost a universal characteristic of the\r\nmanner of the negroes among themselves. They are diabolically cruel to\r\nanimals too, and they seem to me as a rule hardly to know the difference\r\nbetween truth and falsehood. These detestable qualities, which I\r\nconstantly hear attributed to them as innate and inherent in their race,\r\nappear to me the direct result of their condition. The individual\r\nexceptions among them are, I think, quite as many as would be found under\r\nsimilar circumstances, among the same number of white people.\r\n\r\nIn considering the whole condition of the people on this plantation, it\r\nappears to me that the principal hardships fall to the lot of the women;\r\nthat is, the principal physical hardships. The very young members of the\r\ncommunity are of course idle and neglected; the very very old, idle and\r\nneglected too; the middle-aged men do not appear to me over-worked, and\r\nlead a mere animal existence, in itself not peculiarly cruel or\r\ndistressing, but involving a constant element of fear and uncertainty, and\r\nthe trifling evils of unrequited labour, ignorance the most profound, (to\r\nwhich they are condemned by law); and the unutterable injustice which\r\nprecludes them from all the merits and all the benefits of voluntary\r\nexertion, and the progress that results from it. If they are absolutely\r\nunconscious of these evils, then they are not very ill-off brutes, always\r\nbarring the chance of being given or sold away from their mates or their\r\nyoung--processes which even brutes do not always relish. I am very much\r\nstruck with the vein of melancholy, which assumes almost a poetical tone\r\nin some of the things they say. Did I tell you of that poor old decrepid\r\ncreature Dorcas, who came to beg some sugar of me the other day? saying as\r\nshe took up my watch from the table and looked at it, 'Ah? I need not look\r\nat this, I have almost done with time!' Was not that striking from such a\r\npoor old ignorant crone?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. This is the fourth day that I have had a 'gang' of lads\r\nworking in the woods for me after their task hours, for pay; you cannot\r\nthink how zealous and energetic they are; I daresay the novelty of the\r\nprocess pleases them almost as much as the money they earn. I must say\r\nthey quite deserve their small wages.\r\n\r\nLast night I received a present from Mrs. F---- of a drum fish, which\r\nanimal I had never beheld before, and which seemed to me first cousin to\r\nthe great Leviathan. It is to be eaten, and is certainly the biggest fish\r\nfood I ever saw; however, everything is in proportion, and the prawns that\r\ncame with it are upon a similarly extensive scale; this magnificent\r\npiscatorial bounty was accompanied by a profusion of Hamilton green peas,\r\nreally a munificent supply.\r\n\r\nI went out early after breakfast with Jack hunting for new paths; we rode\r\nall along the road by Jones's Creek, and most beautiful it was. We skirted\r\nthe plantation burial ground, and a dismal place it looked; the cattle\r\ntrampling over it in every direction--except where Mr. K---- had had an\r\nenclosure put up round the graves of two white men who had worked on the\r\nestate. They were strangers, and of course utterly indifferent to the\r\npeople here; but by virtue of their white skins, their resting-place was\r\nprotected from the hoofs of the cattle, while the parents and children,\r\nwives, husbands, brothers and sisters, of the poor slaves, sleeping\r\nbeside them, might see the graves of those they loved trampled upon and\r\nbrowsed over, desecrated and defiled, from morning till night. There is\r\nsomething intolerably cruel in this disdainful denial of a common humanity\r\npursuing these wretches even when they are hid beneath the earth.\r\n\r\nThe day was exquisitely beautiful, and I explored a new wood path, and\r\nfound it all strewed with a lovely wild flower not much unlike a primrose.\r\nI spent the afternoon at home. I dread going out twice a-day now, on\r\naccount of the heat and the sand flies. While I was sitting by the window,\r\nAbraham, our cook, went by with some most revolting looking 'raw material'\r\n(part I think of the interior of the monstrous drum fish of which I have\r\ntold you). I asked him with considerable disgust what he was going to do\r\nwith it, he replied, 'Oh! we coloured people eat it, missis;' said I, 'Why\r\ndo you say we coloured people?' 'Because, missis, white people won't touch\r\nwhat we too glad of.' 'That,' said I, 'is because you are poor, and do not\r\noften have meat to eat, not because you are coloured, Abraham; rich white\r\nfolks will not touch what poor white folks are too glad of; it has nothing\r\nin the world to do with colour, and if there were white people here worse\r\noff than you (amazing and inconceivable suggestion, I fear), they would be\r\nglad to eat what you perhaps would not touch.' Profound pause of\r\nmeditation on the part of Abraham, wound up by a considerate 'Well,\r\nmissis, I suppose so.' After which he departed with the horrid looking\r\noffal.\r\n\r\nTo-day--Saturday--I took another ride of discovery round the fields by\r\nJones's. I think I shall soon be able to survey this estate, I have ridden\r\nso carefully over it in every direction; but my rides are drawing to a\r\nclose and even were I to remain here this must be the case unless I got up\r\nand rode under the stars in the cool of the night. This afternoon I was\r\nobliged to drive up to St. Annie's: I had promised the people several\r\ntimes that I would do so. I went after dinner and as late as I could, and\r\nfound very considerable improvement in the whole condition of the place;\r\nthe houses had all been swept, and some of them actually scoured. The\r\nchildren were all quite tolerably clean; they had put slats across all\r\ntheir windows, and little chicken gates to the doors to keep out the\r\npoultry. There was a poor woman lying in one of the cabins in a wretched\r\ncondition. She begged for a bandage, but I do not see of what great use\r\nthat can be to her, as long as she has to hoe in the fields so many hours\r\na day, which I cannot prevent.\r\n\r\nReturning home, Israel undertook to pilot me across the cotton fields into\r\nthe pine land; and a more excruciating process than being dragged over\r\nthat very uneven surface in that wood wagon without springs I did never\r\nendure, mitigated and soothed though it was by the literally fascinating\r\naccount my charioteer gave me of the rattlesnakes with which the place we\r\ndrove through becomes infested as the heat increases. I cannot say that\r\nhis description of them, though more demonstrative as far as regarded his\r\nown horror of them, was really worse than that which Mr. G---- was giving\r\nme of them yesterday. He said they were very numerous, and were found in\r\nevery direction all over the plantation, but that they did not become\r\nreally vicious until quite late in the summer; until then, it appears that\r\nthey generally endeavour to make off if one meets them, but during the\r\nintense heats of the latter part of July and August they never think of\r\nescaping, but at any sight or sound which they may consider inimical, they\r\ninstantly coil themselves for a spring. The most intolerable proceeding on\r\ntheir part, however, that he described, was their getting up into the\r\ntrees, and either coiling themselves in or depending from the branches.\r\nThere is something too revolting in the idea of serpents looking down upon\r\none from the shade of the trees to which one may betake oneself for\r\nshelter in the dreadful heat of the southern midsummer; decidedly I do not\r\nthink the dog-days would be pleasant here. The mocassin snake, which is\r\nnearly as deadly as the rattlesnake, abounds all over the island.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, I had a visit from Mr. C---- and Mr. B----, who officiates\r\nto-morrow at our small island church. The conversation I had with these\r\ngentlemen was sad enough. They seem good and kind and amiable men, and I\r\nhave no doubt are conscientious in their capacity of slaveholders; but to\r\none who has lived outside this dreadful atmosphere, the whole tone of\r\ntheir discourse has a morally muffled sound, which one must hear to be\r\nable to conceive. Mr. B---- told me that the people on this plantation not\r\ngoing to church was the result of a positive order from Mr. K----, who had\r\nperemptorily forbidden their doing so, and of course to have infringed\r\nthat order would have been to incur severe corporal chastisement. Bishop\r\nB----, it seems, had advised that there should be periodical preaching on\r\nthe plantations, which, said Mr. B----, would have obviated any necessity\r\nfor the people of different estates congregating at any given point at\r\nstated times, which might perhaps be objectionable, and at the same time\r\nwould meet the reproach which was now beginning to be directed towards the\r\nsouthern planters as a class, of neglecting the eternal interest of their\r\ndependents. But Mr. K---- had equally objected to this. He seems to have\r\nheld religious teaching a mighty dangerous thing--and how right he was! I\r\nhave met with conventional cowardice of various shades and shapes in\r\nvarious societies that I have lived in; but anything like the pervading\r\ntimidity of tone which I find here on all subjects, but above all on that\r\nof the condition of the slaves, I have never dreamed of. Truly slavery\r\nbegets slavery, and the perpetual state of suspicion and apprehension of\r\nthe slaveholders is a very handsome offset, to say the least of it,\r\nagainst the fetters and the lash of the slaves. Poor people, one and all,\r\nbut especially poor oppressors of the oppressed! The attitude of these men\r\nis really pitiable; they profess (perhaps some of them strive to do so\r\nindeed) to consult the best interests of their slaves, and yet shrink back\r\nterrified from the approach of the slightest intellectual or moral\r\nimprovement which might modify their degraded and miserable existence. I\r\ndo pity these deplorable servants of two masters more than any human\r\nbeings I have ever seen--more than their own slaves a thousand times!\r\n\r\nTo-day is Sunday, and I have been to the little church on the island. It\r\nis the second time since I came down to the south that I have been to a\r\nplace of worship. A curious little incident prefaced my going thither this\r\nmorning. I had desired Israel to get my horse ready and himself to\r\naccompany me, as I meant to ride to church; and you cannot imagine\r\nanything droller than his horror and dismay when he at length comprehended\r\nthat my purpose was to attend divine service in my riding habit. I asked\r\nhim what was the trouble, for though I saw something was creating a\r\ndreadful convulsion in his mind, I had no idea what it was till he told\r\nme, adding, that he had never seen such a thing on St. Simon's in his\r\nlife--as who should say, such a thing was never seen in Hyde Park or the\r\nTuileries before. You may imagine my amusement, but presently I was\r\ndestined to shock something much more serious than poor Israel's sense of\r\n_les convénances et bienséances_, and it was not without something of an\r\neffort that I made up my mind to do so. I was standing at the open window\r\nspeaking to him about the horses, and telling him to get ready to ride\r\nwith me, when George, another of the men, went by with a shade or visor to\r\nhis cap exactly the shape of the one I left behind at the north, and for\r\nwant of which I have been suffering severely from the intense heat and\r\nglare of the sun for the last week. I asked him to hand me his cap,\r\nsaying, 'I want to take the pattern of that shade.' Israel exclaimed, 'Oh\r\nmissis, not to-day; let him leave the cap with you to-morrow, but don't\r\ncut pattern on de Sabbath day!' It seemed to me a much more serious matter\r\nto offend this scruple than the prejudice with regard to praying in a\r\nriding habit; still it had to be done. 'Do you think it wrong, Israel,'\r\nsaid I, 'to work on Sunday?' 'Yes, missis, parson tell we so.' 'Then,\r\nIsrael, be sure you never do it. Did your parson never tell you that your\r\nconscience was for yourself and not for your neighbours, Israel?' 'Oh yes,\r\nmissis, he tell we that too.' 'Then mind that too, Israel.' The shade was\r\ncut out and stitched upon my cap, and protected my eyes from the fierce\r\nglare of the sun and sand as I rode to church.\r\n\r\nOn our way, we came to a field where the young corn was coming up. The\r\nchildren were in the field--little living scarecrows--watching it, of\r\ncourse, as on a weekday, to keep off the birds. I made Israel observe\r\nthis, who replied, 'Oh missis, if de people's corn left one whole day not\r\nwatched, not one blade of it remain to-morrow; it must be watched,\r\nmissis.' 'What, on the Sabbath day, Israel?' 'Yes, missis, or else we lose\r\nit all.' I was not sorry to avail myself of this illustration of the\r\nnature of works of necessity, and proceeded to enlighten Israel with\r\nregard to what I conceive to be the genuine observance of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine anything wilder or more beautiful than the situation of\r\nthe little rustic temple in the woods where I went to worship to-day, with\r\nthe magnificent live oaks standing round it and its picturesque burial\r\nground. The disgracefully neglected state of the latter, its broken and\r\nruinous enclosure, and its shaggy weed-grown graves, tell a strange story\r\nof the residents of this island, who are content to leave the\r\nresting-place of their dead in so shocking a condition. In the tiny little\r\nchamber of a church, the grand old litany of the Episcopal Church of\r\nEngland was not a little shorn of its ceremonial stateliness; clerk there\r\nwas none, nor choir, nor organ, and the clergyman did duty for all, giving\r\nout the hymn and then singing it himself, followed as best might be by the\r\nuncertain voices of his very small congregation, the smallest I think I\r\never saw gathered in a Christian place of worship, even counting a few of\r\nthe negroes who had ventured to place themselves standing at the back of\r\nthe church--an infringement on their part upon the privileges of their\r\nbetters--as Mr. B---- generally preaches a second sermon to them after the\r\n_white_ service, to which as a rule they are not admitted.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the church, I could not but smile at the quaint and original\r\ncostumes with which Israel had so much dreaded a comparison for my\r\nirreproachable London riding habit. However, the strangeness of it was\r\nwhat inspired him with terror; but, at that rate, I am afraid a Paris gown\r\nand bonnet might have been in equal danger of shocking his prejudices.\r\nThere was quite as little affinity with the one as the other in the\r\ncurious specimens of the 'art of dressing' that gradually distributed\r\nthemselves among the two or three indescribable machines (to use the\r\nappropriate Scotch title) drawn up under the beautiful oak trees, on which\r\nthey departed in various directions to the several plantations on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nI mounted my horse, and resumed my ride and my conversation with Israel.\r\nHe told me that Mr. K----'s great objection to the people going to church\r\nwas their meeting with the slaves from the other plantations; and one\r\nreason, he added, that he did not wish them to do that was, that they\r\ntrafficked and bartered away the cooper's wares, tubs, piggins, &c., made\r\non the estate. I think, however, from everything I hear of that gentleman,\r\nthat the mere fact of the Hampton people coming in contact with the slaves\r\nof other plantations would be a thing he would have deprecated. As a\r\nsevere disciplinarian, he was probably right.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our talk, a reference I made to the Bible, and Israel's\r\nanswer that he could not read, made me ask him why his father had never\r\ntaught any of his sons to read; old Jacob, I know, can read. What followed\r\nI shall never forget. He began by giving all sorts of childish unmeaning\r\nexcuses and reasons for never having tried to learn--became confused and\r\nquite incoherent,--and then, suddenly stopping, and pulling up his horse,\r\nsaid, with a look and manner that went to my very heart; 'Missis, what for\r\nme learn to read? me have no prospect!' I rode on without venturing to\r\nspeak to him again for a little while. When I had recovered from that\r\nremark of his, I explained to him that, though indeed 'without prospect'\r\nin some respects, yet reading might avail him much to better his\r\ncondition, moral, mental, and physical. He listened very attentively, and\r\nwas silent for a minute; after which he said:--'All you say very true,\r\nmissis, and me sorry now me let de time pass; but you know what de white\r\nman dat goberns de estate him seem to like and favour, dat de people find\r\nout bery soon and do it; now, Massa K----, him neber favour our reading,\r\nhim not like it; likely as not he lick you if he find you reading, or if\r\nyou wish to teach your children, him always say, \"Pooh, teach 'em to\r\nread--teach 'em to work.\" According to dat, we neber paid much attention\r\nto it, but now it will be different; it was different in former times. De\r\nold folks of my father and mother's time could read more than we can, and\r\nI expect de people will dare to give some thought to it again now.'\r\nThere's a precious sample of what one man's influence may do in his own\r\nsphere, dear E----! This man Israel is a remarkably fine fellow in every\r\nway, with a frank, open, and most intelligent countenance, which rises\r\nbefore me with its look of quiet sadness whenever I think of those words\r\n(and they haunt me), 'I have no prospect.'\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at home, I found that a number of the people, not knowing I\r\nhad gone to church, had come up to the house, hoping that I would read\r\nprayers to them, and had not gone back to their homes, but waited to see\r\nme. I could not bear to disappoint them, for many of them had come from\r\nthe farthest settlements on the estate; and so, though my hot ride had\r\ntired me a good deal, and my talk with Israel troubled me profoundly, I\r\ntook off my habit, and had them all in, and read the afternoon service to\r\nthem. When it was over, two of the women--Venus and Trussa--asked if they\r\nmight be permitted to go to the nursery and see the children. Their\r\naccount of the former condition of the estate was a corroboration of\r\nIsrael's. They said that the older slaves on the plantation had been far\r\nbetter off than the younger ones of the present day; that Major ---- was\r\nconsiderate and humane to his people; and that the women were especially\r\ncarefully treated. But they said Mr. K---- had ruined all the young women\r\nwith working them too soon after their confinements; and as for the elder\r\nones, he would kick them, curse them, turn their clothes over their heads,\r\nflog them unmercifully himself, and abuse them shamefully, no matter what\r\ncondition they were in. They both ended with fervent thanks to God that he\r\nhad left the estate, and rejoicing that we had come, and, above all, that\r\nwe 'had made young missis for them.' Venus went down on her knees,\r\nexclaiming, 'Oh, missis, I glad now; and when I am dead, I glad in my\r\ngrave that you come to us and bring us little missis.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. I still go on exploring, or rather surveying, the estate, the\r\naspect of which is changing every day with the unfolding of the leaves and\r\nthe wonderful profusion of wild flowers. The cleared ground all round the\r\nnew building is one sheet of blooming blue of various tints; it is\r\nperfectly exquisite. But in the midst of my delight at these new blossoms,\r\nI am most sorrowfully bidding adieu to that paragon of parasites, the\r\nyellow jasmine; I think I must have gathered the very last blossoms of it\r\nto-day. Nothing can be more lovely, nothing so exquisitely fragrant. I was\r\nsurprised to recognise by their foliage, to-day, some fine mulberry\r\ntrees, by Jones's Creek; perhaps they are the remains of the silk-worm\r\nexperiment that Mr. C---- persuaded Major ---- to try so ineffectually.\r\nWhile I was looking at some wild plum and cherry trees that were already\r\nswarming with blight in the shape of multitudinous caterpillars' nests, an\r\ningenuous darkie, by name Cudgie, asked me if I could explain to him why\r\nthe trees blossomed out so fair, and then all 'went off into a kind of\r\ndying.' Having directed his vision and attention to the horrid white\r\nglistening webs, all lined with their brood of black devourers, I left him\r\nto draw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was rainy, in spite of which I drove to Busson Hill, and had\r\na talk with Bran about the vile caterpillar blights on the wild plum\r\ntrees, and asked him if it would not be possible to get some sweet grafts\r\nfrom Mr. C---- for some of the wild fruit trees, of which there are such\r\nquantities. Perhaps, however, they are not worth grafting. Bran promised\r\nme that the people should not be allowed to encumber the paths and the\r\nfront of their houses with unsightly and untidy heaps of oyster shells. He\r\npromised all sorts of things. I wonder how soon after I am gone they will\r\nall return into the condition of brutal filth and disorder in which I\r\nfound them.\r\n\r\nThe men and women had done their work here by half-past three. The chief\r\nlabour in the cotton fields, however, is both earlier and later in the\r\nseason. At present they have little to do but let the crop grow. In the\r\nevening I had a visit from the son of a very remarkable man, who had been\r\none of the chief drivers on the estate in Major ----'s time, and his son\r\nbrought me a silver cup which Major ---- had given his father as a\r\ntestimonial of approbation, with an inscription on it recording his\r\nfidelity and trustworthiness at the time of the invasion of the coast of\r\nGeorgia by the English troops. Was not that a curious reward for a slave\r\nwho was supposed not to be able to read his own praises? And yet, from the\r\nhonourable pride with which his son regarded this relic, I am sure the\r\nmaster did well so to reward his servant, though it seemed hard that the\r\nson of such a man should be a slave. Maurice himself came with his\r\nfather's precious silver cup in his hand, to beg for a small pittance of\r\nsugar, and for a prayer-book, and also to know if the privilege of a milch\r\ncow for the support of his family, which was among the favours Major ----\r\nallowed his father, might not be continued to him. He told me he had ten\r\nchildren 'working for massa,' and I promised to mention his petition to\r\nMr. ----.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday last, I rode round the woods near St. Annie's and met with a\r\nmonstrous snake, which Jack called a chicken snake; but whether because it\r\nparticularly affected poultry as its diet, or for what other reason, he\r\ncould not tell me. Nearer home, I encountered another gliding creature,\r\nthat stopped a moment just in front of my horse's feet, as if it was too\r\nmuch afraid of being trampled upon to get out of the way; it was the only\r\nsnake animal I ever saw that I did not think hideous. It was of a\r\nperfectly pure apple green colour, with a delicate line of black like a\r\ncollar round its throat; it really was an exquisite worm, and Jack said it\r\nwas harmless. I did not, however, think it expedient to bring it home in\r\nmy bosom, though if ever I have a pet snake, it shall be such an one.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I drove to Jones's with several supplies of flannel for\r\nthe rheumatic women and old men. We have ridden over to Hamilton again, to\r\npay another visit to the F----s, and on our way passed an enormous\r\nrattlesnake, hanging dead on the bough of a tree. Dead as it was, it\r\nturned me perfectly sick with horror, and I wished very much to come back\r\nto the north immediately, where these are not the sort of blackberries\r\nthat grow on every bush. The evening air now, after the heat of the day,\r\nis exquisitely mild, and the nights dry and wholesome, the whole\r\natmosphere indescribably fragrant with the perfume of flowers; and as I\r\nstood, before going to bed last night, watching the slow revolving light\r\non Sapelo Island, that warns the ships from the dangerous bar at the\r\nriver's mouth, and heard the measured pulse of the great Atlantic waters\r\non the beach, I thought no more of rattlesnakes--no more, for one short\r\nwhile, of slavery. How still, and sweet, and solemn, it was!\r\n\r\nWe have been paying more friendly and neighbourly visits, or rather\r\nreturning them; and the recipients of these civilised courtesies on our\r\nlast calling expedition were the family one member of which was a party\r\nconcerned in that barbarous challenge I wrote you word about. Hitherto\r\nthat very brutal and bloodthirsty cartel appears to have had no result.\r\nYou must not on that account imagine that it will have none. At the north,\r\nwere it possible for a duel intended to be conducted on such savage terms\r\nto be matter of notoriety, the very horror of the thing would create a\r\nfeeling of grotesqueness, and the antagonists in such a proposed encounter\r\nwould simply incur an immense amount of ridicule and obloquy. But here\r\nnobody is astonished and nobody ashamed of such preliminaries to a mortal\r\ncombat between two gentlemen, who propose firing at marks over each\r\nother's hearts, and cutting off each other's heads; and though this\r\nagreeable party of pleasure has not come off yet, there seems to be no\r\nreason why it should not at the first convenient season. Reflecting upon\r\nall which, I rode not without trepidation through Colonel H----'s grounds,\r\nand up to his house. Mr. W----'s head was not stuck upon a pole anywhere\r\nwithin sight, however, and as soon as I became pretty sure of this, I\r\nbegan to look about me, and saw instead a trellis tapestried with the most\r\nbeautiful roses I ever beheld, another of these exquisite southern\r\nflowers--the Cherokee rose. The blossom is very large, composed of four\r\nor five pure white petals, as white and as large as those of the finest\r\nCamellia with a bright golden eye for a focus; the buds and leaves are\r\nlong and elegantly slender, like those of some tea roses, and the green of\r\nthe foliage is dark and at the same time vivid and lustrous; it grew in\r\nmasses so as to form almost a hedge, all starred with these wonderful\r\nwhite blossoms, which, unfortunately, have no perfume.\r\n\r\nWe rode home through the pine land to Jones's, looked at the new house\r\nwhich is coming on hideously, saw two beautiful kinds of trumpet\r\nhoneysuckle already lighting up the woods in every direction with gleams\r\nof scarlet, and when we reached home found a splendid donation of\r\nvegetables, flowers, and mutton from our kind neighbour Mrs. F----, who is\r\na perfect Lady Bountiful to us. This same mutton, however--my heart bleeds\r\nto say it--disappeared the day after it was sent to us. Abraham the cook\r\ndeclares that he locked the door of the safe upon it, which I think may be\r\ntrue, but I also think he unlocked it again. I am sorry; but, after all,\r\nit is very natural these people should steal a little of our meat from us\r\noccasionally, who steal almost all their bread from them habitually.\r\n\r\nI rode yesterday to St. Annie's with Mr. ----. We found a whole tract of\r\nmarsh had been set on fire by the facetious negro called Pun, who had\r\nhelped me out of it some time ago. As he was set to work in it, perhaps it\r\nwas with a view of making it less damp; at any rate, it was crackling,\r\nblazing, and smoking cheerily, and I should think would be insupportable\r\nfor the snakes. While stopping to look at the conflagration, Mr. ---- was\r\naccosted by a three parts naked and one part tattered little she\r\nslave--black as ebony, where her skin was discoverable through its perfect\r\nincrustation of dirt--with a thick mat of frizzly wool upon her skull,\r\nwhich made the sole request she preferred to him irresistibly\r\nludicrous:--'Massa, massa, you please to buy me a comb to tick in my\r\nhead?' Mr. ---- promised her this necessary of life, and I promised myself\r\nto give her the luxury of one whole garment. Mrs. ---- has sent me the\r\nbest possible consolation for the lost mutton, some lovely flowers, and\r\nthese will not be stolen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saturday, the 13th._--Dear E----, I rode to-day through all my woodpaths\r\nfor the last time with Jack, and I think I should have felt quite\r\nmelancholy at taking leave of them and him, but for the apparition of a\r\nlarge black snake, which filled me with disgust and nipped my other\r\nsentiments in the bud. Not a day passes now that I do not encounter one or\r\nmore of these hateful reptiles; it is curious how much more odious they\r\nare to me than the alligators that haunt the mud banks of the river round\r\nthe rice plantation. It is true that there is something very dreadful in\r\nthe thick shapeless mass, uniform in colour almost to the black slime on\r\nwhich it lies basking, and which you hardly detect till it begins to\r\nmove. But even those ungainly crocodiles never sickened me as those rapid,\r\nlithe, and sinuous serpents do. Did I ever tell you that the people at the\r\nrice plantation caught a young alligator and brought it to the house, and\r\nit was kept for some time in a tub of water? It was an ill-tempered little\r\nmonster; it used to set up its back like a cat when it was angry, and open\r\nits long jaws in a most vicious manner.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at my new path in the pine land, I crossed Pike Bluff, and\r\nbreaking my way all through the burnt district, returned home by Jones's.\r\nIn the afternoon, we paid a long visit to Mr. C----. It is extremely\r\ninteresting to me to talk with him about the negroes; he has spent so much\r\nof his life among them, has managed them so humanely, and apparently so\r\nsuccessfully, that his experience is worthy of all attention. And yet it\r\nseems to me that it is impossible, or rather, perhaps, for those very\r\nreasons it is impossible, for him ever to contemplate them in any\r\ncondition but that of slavery. He thinks them very like the Irish, and\r\ninstanced their subserviency, their flattering, their lying, and\r\npilfering, as traits common to the character of both peoples. But I cannot\r\npersuade myself that in both cases, and certainly in that of the negroes,\r\nthese qualities are not in great measure the result of their condition. He\r\nsays that he considers the extremely low diet of the negroes one reason\r\nfor the absence of crimes of a savage nature among them; most of them do\r\nnot touch meat the year round. But in this respect they certainly do not\r\nresemble the Irish, who contrive upon about as low a national diet as\r\ncivilisation is acquainted with, to commit the bloodiest and most frequent\r\noutrages with which civilisation has to deal. His statement that it is\r\nimpossible to bribe the negroes to work on their own account with any\r\nsteadiness may be generally true, but admits of quite exceptions enough to\r\nthrow doubt upon its being natural supineness in the race rather than the\r\ninevitable consequence of denying them the entire right to labour for\r\ntheir own profit. Their laziness seems to me the necessary result of their\r\nprimary wants being supplied, and all progress denied them. Of course, if\r\nthe natural spur to exertion, necessity, is removed, you do away with the\r\nwill to work of a vast proportion of all who do work in the world. It is\r\nthe law of progress that a man's necessities grow with his exertions to\r\nsatisfy them, and labour and improvement thus continually act and react\r\nupon each other to raise the scale of desire and achievement; and I do not\r\nbelieve that, in the majority of instances among any people on the face of\r\nthe earth, the will to labour for small indulgences would survive the loss\r\nof freedom and the security of food enough to exist upon. Mr. ---- said\r\nthat he had offered a bribe of twenty dollars apiece, and the use of a\r\npair of oxen, for the clearing of a certain piece of land, to the men on\r\nhis estate, and found the offer quite ineffectual to procure the desired\r\nresult; the land was subsequently cleared as usual task work under the\r\nlash. Now, certainly, we have among Mr. ----'s people instances of men who\r\nhave made very considerable sums of money by boat-building in their\r\nleisure hours, and the instances of almost life-long persevering stringent\r\nlabour by which slaves have at length purchased their own freedom and that\r\nof their wives and children, are on record in numbers sufficient to prove\r\nthat they are capable of severe sustained effort of the most patient and\r\nheroic kind for that great object, liberty. For my own part, I know no\r\npeople who doat upon labour for its own sake; and it seems to me quite\r\nnatural to any absolutely ignorant and nearly brutish man, if you say to\r\nhim, 'No effort of your own can make you free, but no absence of effort\r\nshall starve you,' to decline to work for anything less than mastery over\r\nhis whole life, and to take up with his mess of porridge as the\r\nalternative. One thing that Mr. ---- said seemed to me to prove rather too\r\nmuch. He declared that his son, objecting to the folks on his plantation\r\ngoing about bare-headed, had at one time offered a reward of a dollar to\r\nthose who should habitually wear hats without being able to induce them to\r\ndo so, which he attributed to sheer careless indolence; but I think it was\r\nmerely the force of the habit of going uncovered rather than absolute\r\nlaziness. The universal testimony of all present at this conversation was\r\nin favour of the sweetness of temper and natural gentleness of\r\ndisposition of the negroes; but these characteristics they seemed to think\r\nless inherent than the result of diet and the other lowering influences of\r\ntheir condition; and it must not be forgotten that on the estate of this\r\nwise and kind master a formidable conspiracy was organised among his\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nWe rowed home through a world of stars, the stedfast ones set in the still\r\nblue sky, and the flashing swathes of phosphoric light turned up by our\r\noars and keel in the smooth blue water. It was lovely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 14th._--My dear E----. That horrid tragedy with which we have\r\nbeen threatened, and of which I was writing to you almost jestingly a few\r\ndays ago, has been accomplished, and apparently without exciting anything\r\nbut the most passing and superficial sensation in this community. The duel\r\nbetween Dr. H---- and Mr. W---- did not take place, but an accidental\r\nencounter in the hotel at Brunswick did, and the former shot the latter\r\ndead on the spot. He has been brought home and buried here by the little\r\nchurch close to his mother's plantation; and the murderer, if he is even\r\nprosecuted, runs no risk of finding a jury in the whole length and breadth\r\nof Georgia who could convict him of anything. It is horrible.\r\n\r\nI drove to church to-day in the wood wagon, with Jack and Aleck, Hector\r\nbeing our charioteer, in a gilt guard-chain and pair of slippers to match\r\nas the Sabbatic part of his attire. The love of dirty finery is not a\r\ntrait of the Irish in Ireland, but I think it crops out strongly when they\r\ncome out here; and the proportion of their high wages put upon their backs\r\nby the young Irish maid-servants in the north, indicates a strong\r\naddiction to the female passion for dress. Here the tendency seems to\r\nexist in men and women alike; but I think all savage men rejoice, even\r\nmore than their women, in personal ornamentation. The negroes certainly\r\nshow the same strong predilection for finery with their womenkind.\r\n\r\nI stopped before going into church to look at the new grave that has taken\r\nits place among the defaced stones, all overgrown with briers, that lie\r\nround it. Poor young W----! poor widowed mother, of whom he was the only\r\nson! What a savage horror! And no one seems to think anything of it, more\r\nthan of a matter of course. My devotions were anything but satisfactory or\r\nrefreshing to me. My mind was dwelling incessantly upon the new grave\r\nunder the great oaks outside, and the miserable mother in her home. The\r\nair of the church was perfectly thick with sand-flies; and the disgraceful\r\ncarelessness of the congregation in responding and singing the hymns, and\r\ntheir entire neglect of the prayer-book regulations for kneeling,\r\ndisturbed and displeased me even more than the last time I was at church;\r\nbut I think that was because of the total absence of excitement or\r\nfeeling among the whole population of St. Simon's upon the subject of the\r\nbloody outrage with which my mind was full, which has given me a sensation\r\nof horror towards the whole community. Just imagine--only it is impossible\r\nto imagine--such a thing taking place in a New England village; the\r\ndismay, the grief, the shame, the indignation, that would fill the hearts\r\nof the whole population. I thought we should surely have some reference to\r\nthe event from the pulpit, some lesson of Christian command over furious\r\npassions. Nothing--nobody looked or spoke as if anything unusual had\r\noccurred; and I left the church, rejoicing to think that I was going away\r\nfrom such a dreadful state of society. Mr. B---- remained to preach a\r\nsecond sermon to the negroes--the duty of submission to masters who\r\nintermurder each other.\r\n\r\nI had service at home in the afternoon, and my congregation was much more\r\ncrowded than usual; for I believe there is no doubt at last that we shall\r\nleave Georgia this week. Having given way so much before when I thought I\r\nwas praying with these poor people for the last time, I suppose I had, so\r\nto speak, expended my emotion; and I was much more composed and quiet than\r\nwhen I took leave of them before. But, to tell you the truth, this\r\ndreadful act of slaughter done in our neighbourhood by one man of our\r\nacquaintance upon another, impresses me to such a degree that I can hardly\r\nturn my mind from it, and Mrs. W---- and her poor young murdered son have\r\ntaken almost complete possession of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers I gave my poor people a parting admonition, and many charges\r\nto remember me and all I had tried to teach them during my stay. They\r\npromised with one voice to mind and do all that 'missis tell we;' and with\r\nmany a parting benediction, and entreaties to me to return, they went\r\ntheir way. I think I have done what I could for them--I think I have done\r\nas well as I could by them; but when the time comes for ending any human\r\nrelation, who can be without their misgivings? who can be bold to say, I\r\ncould have done no more, I could have done no better?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I walked out, and passed many of the people, who are now\r\nbeginning, whenever they see me, to say, 'Good bye, missis!' which is\r\nrather trying. Many of them were clean and tidy, and decent in their\r\nappearance to a degree that certainly bore strong witness to the temporary\r\nefficacy of my influence in this respect. There is, however, of course\r\nmuch individual difference even with reference to this, and some take much\r\nmore kindly and readily to cleanliness, no doubt to godliness too, than\r\nsome others. I met Abraham, and thought that, in a quiet tête-à-tête, and\r\nwith the pathetic consideration of my near departure to assist me, I could\r\nget him to confess the truth about the disappearance of the mutton; but he\r\npersisted in the legend of its departure through the locked door; and as\r\nI was only heaping sins on his soul with every lie I caused him to add to\r\nthe previous ones, I desisted from my enquiries. Dirt and lying are the\r\nnatural tendencies of humanity, which are especially fostered by slavery.\r\nSlaves may be infinitely wrong, and yet it is very hard to blame them.\r\n\r\nI returned home, finding the heat quite oppressive. Late in the evening,\r\nwhen the sun had gone down a long time, I thought I would try and breathe\r\nthe fresh sea air, but the atmosphere was thick with sand-flies, which\r\ndrove me in at last from standing listening to the roar of the Atlantic on\r\nLittle St. Simon's Island, the wooded belt that fends off the ocean surges\r\nfrom the north side of Great St. Simon's. It is a wild little sand-heap,\r\ncovered with thick forest growth, and belongs to Mr. ----. I have long had\r\na great desire to visit it. I hope yet to be able to do so before our\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading, with the utmost interest and admiration,\r\nJ---- C----'s narrative of his escape from the wreck of the Poolaski: what\r\na brave, and gallant, and unselfish soul he must be! You never read\r\nanything more thrilling, in spite of the perfect modesty of this account\r\nof his. If I can obtain his permission, and squeeze out the time, I will\r\nsurely copy it for you. The quiet unassuming character of his usual\r\nmanners and deportment adds greatly to his prestige as a hero. What a fine\r\nthing it must be to be such a man!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDear E----. We shall leave this place next Thursday or Friday, and there\r\nwill be an end to this record; meantime I am fulfilling all sorts of last\r\nduties, and especially those of taking leave of my neighbours, by whom the\r\nneglect of a farewell visit would be taken much amiss.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I rode to a place called Frederica to call on a Mrs. A----, who\r\ncame to see me some time ago. I rode straight through the island by the\r\nmain road that leads to the little church.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe to you the exquisite spring beauty that is now adorning\r\nthese woods, the variety of the fresh new-born foliage, the fragrance of\r\nthe sweet wild perfumes that fill the air? Honeysuckles twine round every\r\ntree; the ground is covered with a low white-blossomed shrub more fragrant\r\nthan lilies of the valley. The accacuas are swinging their silver censers\r\nunder the green roof of these wood temples; every stump is like a\r\nclassical altar to the sylvan gods, garlanded with flowers; every post, or\r\nstick, or slight stem, like a Bacchante's thyrsus, twined with wreaths of\r\nivy and wild vine, waving in the tepid wind. Beautiful butterflies flicker\r\nlike flying flowers among the bushes, and gorgeous birds, like winged\r\njewels, dart from the boughs,--and--and--a huge ground snake slid like a\r\ndark ribbon, across the path while I was stopping to enjoy all this\r\ndeliciousness, and so I became less enthusiastic, and cantered on past\r\nthe little deserted churchyard, with the new-made grave beneath its grove\r\nof noble oaks, and a little farther on reached Mrs. A----'s cottage, half\r\nhidden in the midst of ruins and roses.\r\n\r\nThis Frederica is a very strange place; it was once a town, _the_ town,\r\nthe metropolis of the island. The English, when they landed on the coast\r\nof Georgia in the war, destroyed this tiny place, and it has never been\r\nbuilt up again. Mrs. A----'s, and one other house, are the only dwellings\r\nthat remain in this curious wilderness of dismantled crumbling grey walls\r\ncompassionately cloaked with a thousand profuse and graceful creepers.\r\nThese are the only ruins properly so called, except those of Fort Putnam,\r\nthat I have ever seen in this land of contemptuous youth. I hailed these\r\npicturesque groups and masses with the feelings of a European, to whom\r\nruins are like a sort of relations. In my country, ruins are like a minor\r\nchord in music, here they are like a discord; they are not the relics of\r\ntime, but the results of violence; they recall no valuable memories of a\r\nremote past, and are mere encumbrances to the busy present. Evidently they\r\nare out of place in America, except on St. Simon's Island, between this\r\nsavage selvage of civilisation and the great Atlantic deep. These heaps of\r\nrubbish and roses would have made the fortune of a sketcher; but I imagine\r\nthe snakes have it all to themselves here, and are undisturbed by camp\r\nstools, white umbrellas, and ejaculatory young ladies.\r\n\r\nI sat for a long time with Mrs. A----, and a friend of hers staying with\r\nher, a Mrs. A----, lately from Florida. The latter seemed to me a\r\nremarkable woman; her conversation was extremely interesting. She had been\r\nstopping at Brunswick, at the hotel where Dr. H---- murdered young W----,\r\nand said that the mingled ferocity and blackguardism of the men who\r\nfrequented the house had induced her to cut short her stay there, and come\r\non to her friend Mrs. A----'s. We spoke of that terrible crime which had\r\noccurred only the day after she left Brunswick, and both ladies agreed\r\nthat there was not the slightest chance of Dr. H----'s being punished in\r\nany way for the murder he had committed; that shooting down a man who had\r\noffended you was part of the morals and manners of the southern gentry,\r\nand that the circumstance was one of quite too frequent occurrence to\r\ncause any sensation, even in the small community where it obliterated one\r\nof the principal members of the society. If the accounts given by these\r\nladies of the character of the planters in this part of the south may be\r\nbelieved, they must be as idle, arrogant, ignorant, dissolute, and\r\nferocious as that mediaeval chivalry to which they are fond of comparing\r\nthemselves; and these are southern women, and should know the people among\r\nwhom they live.\r\n\r\nWe had a long discussion on the subject of slavery, and they took as\r\nusual the old ground of justifying the system, _where_ it was administered\r\nwith kindness and indulgence. It is not surprising that women should\r\nregard the question from this point of view; they are very seldom _just_,\r\nand are generally treated with more indulgence than justice by men. They\r\nwere very patient of my strong expressions of reprobation of the whole\r\nsystem, and Mrs. A----, bidding me good-bye, said that, for aught she\r\ncould tell, I might be right, and might have been led down here by\r\nProvidence to be the means of some great change in the condition of the\r\npoor coloured people.\r\n\r\nI rode home pondering on the strange fate that has brought me to this\r\nplace so far from where I was born, this existence so different in all its\r\nelements from that of my early years and former associations. If I\r\nbelieved Mrs. A----'s parting words, I might perhaps verify them; perhaps\r\nI may yet verify although I do not believe them. On my return home, I\r\nfound a most enchanting bundle of flowers, sent to me by Mrs. G----;\r\npomegranate blossoms, roses, honeysuckle, everything that blooms two\r\nmonths later with us in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nI told you I had a great desire to visit Little St. Simon's, and the day\r\nbefore yesterday I determined to make an exploring expedition thither. I\r\ntook M---- and the children, little imagining what manner of day's work\r\nwas before me. Six men rowed us in the 'Lily,' and Israel brought the wood\r\nwagon after us in a flat. Our navigation was a very intricate one, all\r\nthrough sea swamps and marshes, mud-banks and sand-banks, with great white\r\nshells and bleaching bones stuck upon sticks to mark the channel. We\r\nlanded on this forest in the sea by Quash's house, the only human\r\nresidence on the island. It was larger and better, and more substantial\r\nthan the negro huts in general, and he seemed proud and pleased to do the\r\nhonours to us. Thence we set off, by my desire, in the wagon through the\r\nwoods to the beach; road there was none, save the rough clearing that the\r\nmen cut with their axes before us as we went slowly on. Presently, we came\r\nto a deep dry ditch, over which there was no visible means of proceeding.\r\nIsrael told me if we would sit still he would undertake to drive the wagon\r\ninto and out of it; and so, indeed, he did, but how he did it is more than\r\nI can explain to you now, or could explain to myself then. A less powerful\r\ncreature than Montreal could never have dragged us through; and when we\r\npresently came to a second rather worse edition of the same, I insisted\r\nupon getting out and crossing it on foot. I walked half a mile while the\r\nwagon was dragged up and down the deep gulley, and lifted bodily over some\r\nhuge trunks of fallen trees. The wood through which we now drove was all\r\non fire, smoking, flaming, crackling, and burning round us. The sun glared\r\nupon us from the cloudless sky, and the air was one cloud of sand-flies\r\nand mosquitoes. I covered both my children's faces with veils and\r\nhandkerchiefs, and repented not a little in my own breast of the rashness\r\nof my undertaking. The back of Israel's coat was covered so thick with\r\nmosquitoes that one could hardly see the cloth; and I felt as if we should\r\nbe stifled, if our way lay much longer through this terrible wood.\r\nPresently we came to another impassable place, and again got out of the\r\nwagon, leaving Israel to manage it as best he could. I walked with the\r\nbaby in my arms a quarter of a mile, and then was so overcome with the\r\nheat that I sat down in the burning wood, on the floor of ashes, till the\r\nwagon came up again. I put the children and M---- into it, and continued\r\nto walk till we came to a ditch in a tract of salt marsh, over which\r\nIsrael drove triumphantly, and I partly jumped and was partly hauled over,\r\nhaving declined the entreaties of several of the men to let them lie down\r\nand make a bridge with their bodies for me to walk over. At length we\r\nreached the skirt of that tremendous wood, to my unspeakable relief, and\r\ncame upon the white sand hillocks of the beach. The trees were all\r\nstrained crooked, from the constant influence of the sea-blast. The coast\r\nwas a fearful-looking stretch of dismal, trackless sand, and the ocean lay\r\nboundless and awful beyond the wild and desolate beach, from which we were\r\nnow only divided by a patch of low coarse-looking bush, growing as thick\r\nand tangled as heather, and so stiff and compact that it was hardly\r\npossible to drive through it. Yet in spite of this several lads who had\r\njoined our train rushed off into it in search of rabbits, though Israel\r\ncalled repeatedly to them, warning them of the danger of rattlesnakes. We\r\ndrove at last down to the smooth sea sand; and here, outstripping our\r\nguides, was barred farther progress by a deep gully, down which it was\r\nimpossible to take the wagon. Israel, not knowing the beach well, was\r\nafraid to drive round the mouth of it; and so it was determined that from\r\nthis point we should walk home under his guidance. I sat in the wagon\r\nwhile he constructed a rough foot-bridge of bits of wood and broken planks\r\nfor us, over the narrow chasm, and he then took Montreal out of the wagon\r\nand tied him behind it, leaving him for the other men to take charge of\r\nwhen they should arrive at this point. And so, having mightily desired to\r\nsee the coast of Little St. Simon's Island, I did see it thoroughly; for I\r\nwalked a mile and a half round it, over beds of sharp shells, through\r\nswamps half knee deep, poor little S---- stumping along with dogged\r\nheroism, and Israel carrying the baby, except at one deep _mal passo_,\r\nwhen I took the baby and he carried S----; and so, through the wood round\r\nQuash's house, where we arrived almost fainting with fatigue and heat, and\r\nwhere we rested but a short time; for we had to start almost immediately\r\nto save the tide home.\r\n\r\nI called at Mr. C----'s on my way back, to return him his son's\r\nmanuscript, which I had in the boat for that purpose. I sent Jack, who\r\nhad come to meet me with the horses, home, being too tired to attempt\r\nriding; and, covered with mud literally up to my knees I was obliged to\r\nlie down ignominiously all the afternoon to rest. And now I will give you\r\na curious illustration of the utter subserviency of slaves. It seems that\r\nby taking the tide in proper season, and going by boat, all that horrible\r\nwood journey might have been avoided, and we could have reached the beach,\r\nwith perfect ease in half the time; but because, being of course\r\nabsolutely ignorant of this, I had expressed a desire to go through the\r\nwood, not a syllable of remonstrance was uttered by any one; and the men\r\nnot only underwent the labour of cutting a path for the wagon and dragging\r\nit through and over all the impediments we encountered, but allowed me and\r\nthe children to traverse that burning wood, rather than tell me that by\r\nwaiting and taking another way I could get to the sea. When I expressed my\r\nastonishment at their not having remonstrated against my order, and\r\nexplained how I could best achieve the purpose I had in view, the sole\r\nanswer I got even from Israel was, 'Missis say so, so me do; missis say me\r\ngo through the wood, me no tell missis go another way.' You see, my dear\r\nE----, one had need bethink oneself what orders one gives, when one has\r\nthe misfortune to be despotic.\r\n\r\nHow sorry I am that I have been obliged to return that narrative of Mr.\r\nC----'s without asking permission to copy it, which I did not do because\r\nI should not have been able to find the time to do it! We go away the day\r\nafter to-morrow. All the main incidents of the disaster the newspapers\r\nhave made you familiar with--the sudden and appalling loss of that fine\r\nvessel laden with the very flower of the south. There seems hardly to be a\r\nfamily in Georgia and South Carolina that had not some of its members on\r\nboard that ill-fated ship. You know it was a sort of party of pleasure\r\nmore than anything else; the usual annual trip to the north for change of\r\nair and scene, for the gaieties of Newport and Saratoga, that all the\r\nwealthy southern people invariably take every summer.\r\n\r\nThe weather had been calm and lovely; and dancing, talking, and laughing,\r\nas if they were in their own drawing-rooms, they had passed the time away\r\ntill they all separated for the night. At the first sound of the exploding\r\nboiler, Mr. C---- jumped up, and in his shirt and trousers ran on deck.\r\nThe scene was one of horrible confusion; women screaming, men swearing,\r\nthe deck strewn with broken fragments of all descriptions, the vessel\r\nleaning frightfully to one side, and everybody running hither and thither\r\nin the darkness in horror and dismay. He had left Georgia with Mrs. F----\r\nand Mrs. N----, the two children, and one of the female servants of these\r\nladies under his charge. He went immediately to the door of the ladies'\r\ncabin and called Mrs. F----; they were all there half-dressed; he bade\r\nthem dress as quickly as possible and be ready to follow and obey him. He\r\nreturned almost instantly, and led them to the side of the vessel, where,\r\ninto the boats, that had already been lowered, desperate men and women\r\nwere beginning to swarm, throwing themselves out of the sinking ship. He\r\nbade Mrs. F---- jump down into one of these boats which was only in the\r\npossession of two sailors; she instantly obeyed him, and he threw her\r\nlittle boy to the men after her. He then ordered Mrs. N----, with the\r\nnegro woman, to throw themselves off the vessel into the boat, and, with\r\nMrs. N----'s baby in his arms, sprang after them. His foot touched the\r\ngunwale of the boat, and he fell into the water; but recovering himself\r\ninstantly, he clambered into the boat, which he then peremptorily ordered\r\nthe men to set adrift, in spite of the shrieks, and cries, and commands,\r\nand entreaties of the frantic crowds who were endeavouring to get into it.\r\nThe men obeyed him, and rowing while he steered, they presently fell\r\nastern of the ship, in the midst of the darkness and tumult and terror.\r\nAnother boat laden with people was near them. For some time they saw the\r\nheartrending spectacle of the sinking vessel, and the sea strewn with\r\nmattresses, seats, planks, &c, to which people were clinging, floating,\r\nand shrieking for succour, in the dark water all round them. But they\r\ngradually pulled further and further out of the horrible chaos of despair,\r\nand, with the other boat still consorting with them, rowed on. They\r\nwatched from a distance the piteous sight of the ill-fated steamer\r\nsettling down, the gay girdle of light that marked the line of her\r\nbeautiful saloons and cabins gradually sinking nearer and nearer to the\r\nblackness, in which they were presently extinguished; and the ship, with\r\nall its precious human freight engulfed--all but the handful left in those\r\ntwo open boats, to brave the dangers of that terrible coast!\r\n\r\nThey were somewhere off the North Carolina shore, which, when the daylight\r\ndawned, they could distinctly see, with its ominous line of breakers and\r\ninhospitable perilous coast. The men had continued rowing all night, and\r\nas the summer sun rose flaming over their heads, the task of pulling the\r\nboat became dreadfully severe; still they followed the coast, Mr. C----\r\nlooking out for any opening, creek, or small inlet, that might give them a\r\nchance of landing in safety. The other boat rowed on at some little\r\ndistance from them.\r\n\r\nAll the morning, and through the tremendous heat of the middle day, they\r\ntoiled on without a mouthful of food--without a drop of water. At length,\r\ntowards the afternoon, the men at the oars said they were utterly\r\nexhausted and could row no longer, and that Mr. C---- must steer the boat\r\nashore. With wonderful power of command, he prevailed on them to continue\r\ntheir afflicting labour. The terrible blazing sun pouring on all their\r\nunsheltered heads had almost annihilated them; but still there lay\r\nbetween them and the land those fearful foaming ridges, and the women and\r\nchildren, if not the men themselves, seemed doomed to inevitable death in\r\nthe attempt to surmount them. Suddenly they perceived that the boat that\r\nhad kept them company was about to adventure itself in the perilous\r\nexperiment of landing. Mr. C---- kept his boat's head steady, the men\r\nrested on their oars, and watched the result of the fearful risk they were\r\nthemselves about to run. They saw the boat enter the breakers--they saw\r\nher whirled round and capsized, and then they watched, slowly emerging and\r\ndragging themselves out of the foaming sea, _some_, and only some, of the\r\npeople that they knew the boat contained. Mr. C----, fortified with this\r\nterrible illustration of the peril that awaited them, again besought them\r\nto row yet for a little while further along the coast, in search of some\r\npossible place to take the boat safely to the beach, promising at sunset\r\nto give up the search; and again the poor men resumed their toil, but the\r\nline of leaping breakers stretched along the coast as far as eye could\r\nsee, and at length the men declared they could labour no longer, and\r\ninsisted that Mr. C---- should steer them to shore. He then said that he\r\nwould do so, but they must take some rest before encountering the peril\r\nwhich awaited them, and for which they might require whatever remaining\r\nstrength they could command. He made the men leave the oars and lie down\r\nto sleep for a short time, and then, giving the helm to one of them, did\r\nthe same himself. When they were thus a little refreshed with this short\r\nrest, he prepared to take the boat into the breakers.\r\n\r\nHe laid Mrs. N----'s baby on her breast, and wrapped a shawl round and\r\nround her body so as to secure the child to it, and said, in the event of\r\nthe boat capsizing, he would endeavour to save her and her child. Mrs.\r\nF---- and her boy he gave in charge to one of the sailors, and the\r\ncoloured woman who was with her to the other; and they promised solemnly,\r\nin case of misadventure to the boat, to do their best to save these\r\nhelpless creatures; and so they turned, as the sun was going down, the\r\nbows of the boat to the terrible shore. They rose two of the breakers\r\nsafely, but then the oar of one of the men was struck from his hand, and\r\nin an instant the boat whirled round and turned over. Mr. C---- instantly\r\nstruck out to seize Mrs. N----, but she had sunk, and though he dived\r\ntwice he could not see her; at last, he felt her hair floating loose with\r\nhis foot, and seizing hold of it, grasped her securely and swam with her\r\nto shore. While in the act of doing so, he saw the man who had promised to\r\nsave the coloured woman making alone for the beach; and even then, in that\r\nextremity, he had power of command enough left to drive the fellow back to\r\nseek her, which he did, and brought her safe to land. The other man kept\r\nhis word of taking care of Mrs. F----, and the latter never released her\r\ngrasp of her child's wrist, which bore the mark of her agony for weeks\r\nafter their escape. They reached the sands, and Mrs. N----'s shawl having\r\nbeen unwound, her child was found laughing on her bosom. But hardly had\r\nthey had time to thank God for their deliverance when Mr. C---- fell\r\nfainting on the beach; and Mrs. F----, who told me this, said that for one\r\ndreadful moment they thought that the preserver of all their lives had\r\nlost his own in the terrible exertion and anxiety that he had undergone.\r\nHe revived, however, and crawling a little further up the beach, they\r\nburrowed for warmth and shelter as well as they could in the sand, and lay\r\nthere till the next morning, when they sought and found succour.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine, my dear E----, how strikingly throughout this whole\r\nnarrative the extraordinary power of Mr. C----'s character makes itself\r\nfelt,--the immediate obedience that he obtained from women whose terror\r\nmight have made them unmanageable, and men whose selfishness might have\r\ndefied his control; the wise though painful firmness, which enabled him to\r\norder the boat away from the side of the perishing vessel, in spite of the\r\npity that he felt for the many, in attempting to succour whom he could\r\nonly have jeopardized the few whom he was bound to save; the wonderful\r\ninfluence he exercised over the poor oarsmen, whose long protracted labour\r\npostponed to the last possible moment the terrible risk of their landing.\r\nThe firmness, courage, humanity, wisdom, and presence of mind, of all his\r\npreparations for their final tremendous risk, and the authority which he\r\nwas able to exercise while struggling in the foaming water for his own\r\nlife and that of the woman and child he was saving, over the man who was\r\nproving false to a similar sacred charge,--all these admirable traits are\r\nmost miserably transmitted to you by my imperfect account; and when I\r\nassure you that his own narrative, full as it necessarily was of the\r\ndetails of his own heroism, was as simple, modest, and unpretending, as it\r\nwas interesting and touching, I am sure you will agree with me that he\r\nmust be a very rare man. When I spoke with enthusiasm to his old father of\r\nhis son's noble conduct, and asked him if he was not proud of it, his sole\r\nreply was,--'I am glad, madam, my son was not selfish.'\r\n\r\nNow, E----, I have often spoken with you and written to you of the\r\ndisastrous effect of slavery upon the character of the white men\r\nimplicated in it; many, among themselves, feel and acknowledge it to the\r\nfullest extent, and no one more than myself can deplore that any human\r\nbeing I love should be subjected to such baneful influences; but the devil\r\nmust have his due, and men brought up in habits of peremptory command over\r\ntheir fellow men, and under the constant apprehension of danger, and awful\r\nnecessity of immediate readiness to meet it, acquire qualities precious to\r\nthemselves and others in hours of supreme peril such as this man passed\r\nthrough, saving by their exercise himself and all committed to his charge.\r\nI know that the southern men are apt to deny the fact that they do live\r\nunder an habitual sense of danger; but a slave population, coerced into\r\nobedience, though unarmed and half fed, _is_ a threatening source of\r\nconstant insecurity, and every southern _woman_ to whom I have spoken on\r\nthe subject, has admitted to me that they live in terror of their slaves.\r\nHappy are such of them as have protectors like J---- C----. Such men will\r\nbest avoid and best encounter the perils that may assail them from the\r\nabject subject, human element, in the control of which their noble\r\nfaculties are sadly and unworthily employed.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 17th April._--I rode to-day after breakfast, to Mrs. D----'s,\r\nanother of my neighbours, who lives full twelve miles off. During the last\r\ntwo miles of my expedition, I had the white sand hillocks and blue line of\r\nthe Atlantic in view. The house at which I called was a tumble-down\r\nbarrack of a dwelling in the woods, with a sort of poverty-stricken\r\npretentious air about it, like sundry 'proud planters' dwellings that I\r\nhave seen. I was received by the sons as well as the lady of the house,\r\nand could not but admire the lordly rather than manly indifference, with\r\nwhich these young gentlemen, in gay guard chains and fine attire, played\r\nthe gallants to me, while filthy, bare-footed half naked negro women\r\nbrought in refreshments, and stood all the while fanning the cake, and\r\nsweetmeats, and their young masters, as if they had been all the same sort\r\nof stuff. I felt ashamed for the lads. The conversation turned upon Dr.\r\nH----'s trial; for there has been a trial as a matter of form, and an\r\nacquittal as a matter of course; and the gentlemen said, upon my\r\nexpressing some surprise at the latter event, that there could not be\r\nfound in all Georgia a jury who would convict him, which says but little\r\nfor the moral sense of 'all Georgia.' From this most painful subject we\r\nfell into the Brunswick canal, and thereafter I took my leave and rode\r\nhome. I met my babies in the wood-wagon, and took S---- up before me, and\r\ngave her a good gallop home. Having reached the house with the appetite of\r\na twenty-four miles' ride, I found no preparation for dinner, and not so\r\nmuch as a boiled potato to eat, and the sole reply to my famished and\r\ndisconsolate exclamations was--'Being that you order none, missis, I not\r\nknow.' I had forgotten to order my dinner, and my _slaves_, unauthorised,\r\nhad not ventured to prepare any. Wouldn't a Yankee have said, 'Wal now,\r\nyou went off so uncommon quick, I kinder guessed you forgot all about\r\ndinner,' and have had it all ready for me? But my slaves durst not, and so\r\nI fasted till some tea could be got for me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the last letter I wrote from the plantation, and I never returned\r\nthere, nor ever saw again any of the poor people among whom I lived during\r\nthis winter, but Jack, once, under sad circumstances. The poor lad's\r\nhealth failed so completely, that his owners humanely brought him to the\r\nnorth, to try what benefit he might derive from the change; but this was\r\nbefore the passing of the Fugitive Slave Bill, when touching the soil of\r\nthe northern states, a slave became free; and such was the apprehension\r\nfelt lest Jack should be enlightened as to this fact by some philanthropic\r\nabolitionist, that he was kept shut up in a high upper room of a large\r\nempty house, where even I was not allowed to visit him. I heard at length\r\nof his being in Philadelphia; and upon my distinct statement that I\r\nconsidered freeing their slaves the business of the Messrs. ----\r\nthemselves, and not mine, I was at length permitted to see him. Poor\r\nfellow! coming to the north did not prove to him the delight his eager\r\ndesire had so often anticipated from it; nor under such circumstances is\r\nit perhaps much to be wondered at that he benefited but little by the\r\nchange,--he died not long after.\r\n\r\nI once heard a conversation between Mr. O---- and Mr. K----, the two\r\noverseers of the plantation on which I was living, upon the question of\r\ntaking slaves, servants, necessary attendants, into the northern states;\r\nMr. O---- urged the danger of their being 'got hold of,' i.e., set free\r\nby the abolitionists, to which Mr. K---- very pertinently replied, 'Oh,\r\nstuff and nonsense, I take care when my wife goes north with the children,\r\nto send Lucy with her; _her children are down here, and I defy all the\r\nabolitionists in creation to get her to stay north_.' Mr. K---- was an\r\nextremely wise man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote the following letter after reading several leading articles in the\r\n_Times_ newspaper, at the time of the great sensation occasioned by Mrs.\r\nBeecher Stowe's novel of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and after the Anti-Slavery\r\nProtest which that book induced the women of England to address to those\r\nof America, on the subject of the condition of the slaves in the southern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear E----. I have read the articles in the _Times_ to which you refer,\r\non the subject of the inaccuracy of Mrs. Beecher Stowe's book as a picture\r\nof slavery in America, and have ascertained who they were written by.\r\nHaving done so, I do not think it worth while to send my letter for\r\ninsertion, because, as that is the tone deliberately taken upon the\r\nsubject by that paper, my counter statement would not, I imagine, be\r\nadmitted into its columns. I enclose it to you, as I should like you to\r\nsee how far from true, according to my experience, the statements of the\r\n'_Times'_ Correspondent' are. It is impossible of course to know why it\r\nerects itself into an advocate for slavery; and the most charitable\r\nconjecture I can form upon the subject is, that the Stafford House\r\ndemonstration may have been thought likely to wound the sensitive national\r\nviews of America upon this subject; and the statement put forward by the\r\n_Times_, contradicting Mrs. Stowe's picture, may be intended to soothe\r\ntheir irritation at the philanthropic zeal of our lady abolitionists.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear E----,\r\n\r\nYours always truly,\r\n\r\nF.A.K.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to the Editor of the_ 'Times.'\r\n\r\nSir,--As it is not to be supposed that you consciously afford the support\r\nof your great influence to misstatements, I request your attention to some\r\nremarks I wish to make on an article on a book called 'Uncle Tom's Cabin\r\nas it is,' contained in your paper of the 11th. In treating Mrs. Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe's work as an exaggerated picture of the evils of slavery, I\r\nbeg to assure you that you do her serious injustice:--of the merits of her\r\nbook as a work of art, I have no desire to speak,--to its power as a most\r\ninteresting and pathetic story, all England and America can bear\r\nwitness,--but of its truth and moderation as a representation of the\r\nslave system in the United States, I can testify with the experience of\r\nan eye witness, having been a resident in the Southern States, and had\r\nopportunities of observation such as no one who has not lived on a slave\r\nestate can have. It is very true that in reviving the altogether exploded\r\nfashion of making the hero of her novel 'the perfect monster that the\r\nworld ne'er saw,' Mrs. Stowe has laid herself open to fair criticism, and\r\nmust expect to meet with it from the very opposite taste of the present\r\nday; but the ideal excellence of her principal character is no argument at\r\nall against the general accuracy of her statements with regard to the\r\nevils of slavery;--everything else in her book is not only possible, but\r\nprobable, and not only probable, but a very faithful representation of the\r\nexisting facts:--faithful, and not, as you accuse it of being,\r\nexaggerated; for, with the exception of the horrible catastrophe, the\r\nflogging to death of poor Tom, she has pourtrayed none of the most\r\nrevolting instances of crime produced by the slave system--with which she\r\nmight have darkened her picture, without detracting from its perfect\r\ntruth. Even with respect to the incident of Tom's death, it must not be\r\nsaid that if such an event is possible, it is hardly probable; for this is\r\nunfortunately not true. It is not true that the value of the slave as\r\nproperty infallibly protects his life from the passions of his master. It\r\nis no new thing for a man's passions to blind him to his most obvious and\r\nimmediate temporal interests, as well as to his higher and everlasting\r\nones,--in various parts of the world and stages of civilisation, various\r\nhuman passions assume successive prominence, and become developed, to the\r\npartial exclusion or deadening of others. In savage existence, and those\r\nstates of civilisation least removed from it, the animal passions\r\npredominate. In highly cultivated modern society, where the complicated\r\nmachinery of human existence is at once a perpetually renewed cause and\r\neffect of certain legal and moral restraints, which, in the shape of\r\ngovernment and public opinion, protect the congregated lives and interests\r\nof men from the worst outrages of open violence, the natural selfishness\r\nof mankind assumes a different development; and the love of power, of\r\npleasure, or of pelf, exhibits different phenomena from those elicited\r\nfrom a savage under the influence of the same passions. The channel in\r\nwhich the energy and activity of modern society inclines more and more to\r\npour itself, is the peaceful one of the pursuit of gain. This is\r\npreeminently the case with the two great commercial nations of the earth,\r\nEngland and America;--and in either England or the Northern States of\r\nAmerica, the prudential and practical views of life prevail so far, that\r\ninstances of men sacrificing their money interests at the instigation of\r\nrage, revenge, and hatred, will certainly not abound. But the Southern\r\nslaveholders are a very different race of men from either Manchester\r\nmanufacturers or Massachusetts merchants; they are a remnant of barbarism\r\nand feudalism, maintaining itself with infinite difficulty and danger by\r\nthe side of the latest and most powerful developement of commercial\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Baltimore, Richmond, Charleston, Savannah, and New\r\nOrleans, whose estates lie like the suburban retreats of our city magnates\r\nin the near neighbourhood of their respective cities, are not now the\r\npeople I refer to. They are softened and enlightened by many\r\ninfluences,--the action of city life itself, where human sympathy, and\r\nhuman respect, stimulated by neighbourhood, produce salutary social\r\nrestraint, as well as less salutary social cowardice. They travel to the\r\nNorthern States, and to Europe; and Europe and the Northern States travel\r\nto them; and in spite of themselves, their peculiar conditions receive\r\nmodifications from foreign intercourse. The influence, too, of commercial\r\nenterprise, which, in these latter days, is becoming the agent of\r\ncivilisation all over the earth, affects even the uncommercial residents\r\nof the Southern cities, and however cordially they may dislike or despise\r\nthe mercantile tendencies of Atlantic Americans, or transatlantic\r\nEnglishmen, their frequent contact with them breaks down some of the\r\nbarriers of difference between them, and humanises the slaveholder of the\r\ngreat cities into some relation with the spirit of his own times and\r\ncountry. But these men are but a most inconsiderable portion of the\r\nslaveholding population of the South,--a nation, for as such they should\r\nbe spoken of, of men whose organisation and temperament is that of the\r\nsouthern European; living under the influence of a climate at once\r\nenervating and exciting; scattered over trackless wildernesses of arid\r\nsand and pestilential swamp; entrenched within their own boundaries;\r\nsurrounded by creatures absolutely subject to their despotic will;\r\ndelivered over by hard necessity to the lowest excitements of drinking,\r\ngambling, and debauchery for sole recreation; independent of all opinion;\r\nignorant of all progress; isolated from all society--it is impossible to\r\nconceive a more savage existence within the pale of any modern\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolinan gentry have been fond of styling themselves the\r\nchivalry of the South, and perhaps might not badly represent, in their\r\nrelations with their dependents, the nobility of France before the\r\npurifying hurricane of the Revolution swept the rights of the suzerain and\r\nthe wrongs of the serf together into one bloody abyss. The planters of the\r\ninterior of the Southern and South-Western States, with their furious\r\nfeuds and slaughterous combats, their stabbings and pistolings, their\r\ngross sensuality, brutal ignorance, and despotic cruelty, resemble the\r\nchivalry of France before the horrors of the Jacquerie admonished them\r\nthat there was a limit even to the endurance of slaves. With such men as\r\nthese, human life, even when it can be bought or sold in the market for so\r\nmany dollars, is but little protected by considerations of interest from\r\nthe effects of any violent passion. There is yet, however, another aspect\r\nof the question, which is, that it is sometimes clearly _not_ the interest\r\nof the owner to prolong the life of his slaves; as in the case of inferior\r\nor superannuated labourers, or the very notorious instance in which some\r\nof the owners of sugar plantations stated that they found it better worth\r\ntheir while to _work off_ (i.e. kill with labour) a certain proportion, of\r\ntheir force, and replace them by new hands every seven years, than work\r\nthem less severely and maintain them in diminished efficiency for an\r\nindefinite length of time. Here you will observe a precise estimate of the\r\nplanter's material interest led to a result which you argue passion itself\r\ncan never be so blind as to adopt. This was a deliberate economical\r\ncalculation, openly avowed some years ago by a number of sugar planters in\r\nLouisiana. If, instead of accusing Mrs. Stowe of exaggeration, you had\r\nbrought the same charge against the author of the 'White Slave,' I should\r\nnot have been surprised; for his book presents some of the most revolting\r\ninstances of atrocity and crime that the miserable abuse of irresponsible\r\npower is capable of producing, and it is by no means written in the spirit\r\nof universal humanity which pervades Mrs. Stowe's volumes: but it is not\r\nliable to the charge of exaggeration, any more than her less disgusting\r\ndelineation. The scenes described in the 'White Slave' _do_ occur in the\r\nslave States of North America; and in two of the most appalling incidents\r\nof the book--the burning alive of the captured runaway, and the hanging\r\nwithout trial of the Vicksburg gamblers--the author of the 'White Slave'\r\nhas very simply related positive facts of notorious occurrence. To which\r\nhe might have added, had he seen fit to do so, the instance of a slave who\r\nperished in the sea swamps, where he was left bound and naked, a prey to\r\nthe torture inflicted upon him by the venomous mosquito swarms. My\r\npurpose, however, in addressing you was not to enter into a disquisition\r\non either of these publications; but I am not sorry to take this\r\nopportunity of bearing witness to the truth of Mrs. Stowe's admirable\r\nbook, and I have seen what few Englishmen can see--the working of the\r\nsystem in the midst of it.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your 'Dispassionate Observer,' who went to the South\r\nprofessedly with the purpose of seeing and judging of the state of things\r\nfor himself, let me tell you that, little as he may be disposed to believe\r\nit, his testimony is worth less than nothing; for it is morally impossible\r\nfor any Englishman going into the Southern States, except as a _resident_,\r\nto know anything whatever of the real condition of the slave population.\r\nThis was the case some years ago, as I experienced, and it is now likely\r\nto be more the case than ever; for the institution is not _yet_ approved\r\ndivine to the perceptions of Englishmen, and the Southerners are as\r\nanxious to hide its uglier features from any note-making observer from\r\nthis side the water, as to present to his admiration and approval such as\r\ncan by any possibility be made to wear the most distant approach to\r\ncomeliness.\r\n\r\nThe gentry of the Southern States are preeminent in their own country\r\nfor that species of manner which, contrasted with the breeding of the\r\nNortherners, would be emphatically pronounced 'good' by Englishmen. Born\r\nto inhabit landed property, they are not inevitably made clerks and\r\ncounting-house men of, but inherit with their estates some of the\r\ninvariable characteristics of an aristocracy. The shop is not their\r\nelement; and the eager spirit of speculation and the sordid spirit of\r\ngain do not infect their whole existence, even to their very demeanour\r\nand appearance, as they too manifestly do those of a large proportion of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Northern States. Good manners have an undue value\r\nfor Englishmen, generally speaking; and whatever departs from their\r\npeculiar standard of breeding is apt to prejudice them, as whatever\r\napproaches it prepossesses them, far more than is reasonable. The\r\nSoutherners are infinitely better bred men, according to English\r\nnotions, than the men of the Northern States. The habit of command gives\r\nthem a certain self-possession, the enjoyment of leisure a certain ease.\r\nTheir temperament is impulsive and enthusiastic, and their manners have\r\nthe grace and spirit which seldom belong to the deportment of a Northern\r\npeople; but upon more familiar acquaintance, the vices of the social\r\nsystem to which they belong will be found to have infected them with\r\ntheir own peculiar taint; and haughty overbearing irritability,\r\neffeminate indolence, reckless extravagance, and a union of profligacy\r\nand cruelty, which is the immediate result of their irresponsible power\r\nover their dependents, are some of the less pleasing traits which\r\nacquaintance developes in a Southern character. In spite of all this,\r\nthere is no manner of doubt that the 'candid English observer' will, for\r\nthe season of his sojourning among them, greatly prefer their\r\nintercourse to that of their Northern brethren. Moreover, without in the\r\nleast suspecting it, he will be bribed insidiously and incessantly by\r\nthe extreme desire and endeavour to please and prepossess him which the\r\nwhole white population of the slave States will exhibit--as long as he\r\ngoes only as a 'candid observer,' with a mind not _yet_ made up upon the\r\nsubject of slavery, and open to conviction as to its virtues. Every\r\nconciliating demonstration of courtesy and hospitable kindness will be\r\nextended to him, and, as I said before, if his observation is permitted\r\n(and it may even appear to be courted), it will be to a fairly bound\r\npurified edition of the black book of slavery, in which, though the\r\ninherent viciousness of the whole story cannot be suppressed, the\r\ncoarser and more offensive passages will be carefully expunged. And now,\r\npermit me to observe, that the remarks of your traveller must derive\r\nmuch of their value from the scene of his enquiry. In Maryland,\r\nKentucky, and Virginia, the outward aspect of slavery has ceased to wear\r\nits most deplorable features. The remaining vitality of the system no\r\nlonger resides in the interests, but in the pride and prejudices of the\r\nplanters. Their soil and climate are alike favourable to the labours of\r\na white peasantry: the slave cultivation has had time to prove itself\r\nthere the destructive pest which, in time, it will prove itself wherever\r\nit prevails. The vast estates and large fortunes that once maintained,\r\nand were maintained by, the serfdom of hundreds of negroes, have\r\ndwindled in size and sunk in value, till the slaves have become so heavy\r\na burthen on the resources of the exhausted soil and impoverished owners\r\nof it, that they are made themselves objects of traffic in order to ward\r\noff the ruin that their increase would otherwise entail. Thus, the\r\nplantations of the Northern slave States now present to the traveller\r\nvery few of the darker and more oppressive peculiarities of the system;\r\nand, provided he does not stray too near the precincts where the negroes\r\nare sold, or come across gangs of them on their way to Georgia,\r\nLouisiana, or Alabama, he may, if he is a very superficial observer,\r\nconclude that the most prosperous slavery is not much worse than the\r\nmost miserable freedom.\r\n\r\nBut of what value will be such conclusions applied to those numerous\r\nplantations where no white man ever sets foot without the express\r\npermission of the owner? not estates lying close to Baltimore and\r\nCharleston, or even Lesington or Savannah, but remote and savage\r\nwildernesses like Legree's estate in 'Uncle Tom,' like all the plantations\r\nin the interior of Tennessee and Alabama, like the cotton-fields and\r\nrice-swamps of the great muddy rivers of Lousiana and Georgia, like the\r\ndreary pine barrens and endless woody wastes of north Carolina. These,\r\nespecially the islands, are like so many fortresses, approachable for\r\n'observers' only at the owners' will. On most of the rice plantations in\r\nthese pestilential regions, no white man can pass the night at certain\r\nseasons of the year without running the risk of his life; and during the\r\nday, the master and overseer are as much alone and irresponsible in their\r\ndominion over their black cattle, as Robinson Crusoe was over his small\r\nfamily of animals on his desert habitation. Who, on such estates as these,\r\nshall witness to any act of tyranny or barbarity, however atrocious? No\r\nblack man's testimony is allowed against a white, and who on the dismal\r\nswampy rice-grounds of the Savannah, or the sugar-brakes of the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries, or the up country cotton lands of the\r\nOcamulgee, shall go to perform the task of candid observation and\r\nbenevolent enquiry?\r\n\r\nI passed some time on two such estates--plantations where the negroes\r\nesteemed themselves well off, and, compared with the slaves on several of\r\nthe neighbouring properties, might very well consider themselves so; and\r\nI will, with your permission, contrast some of the items of my observation\r\nwith those of the traveller whose report you find so satisfactory on the\r\nsubject of the 'consolations' of slavery.\r\n\r\nAnd first, for the attachment which he affirms to subsist between the\r\nslave and master. I do not deny that certain manifestations on the part of\r\nthe slave may suggest the idea of such a feeling; but whether upon better\r\nexamination it will be found to deserve the name, I very much doubt. In\r\nthe first place, on some of the great Southern estates, the owners are\r\nhabitual absentees, utterly unknown to their serfs, and enjoying the\r\nproceeds of their labour in residences as remote as possible from the\r\nsands and swamps where their rice and cotton grow, and their slaves bow\r\nthemselves under the eye of the white overseer, and the lash of the black\r\ndriver. Some of these Sybarites prefer living in Paris, that paradise of\r\nAmerican republicans, some in the capitals of the middle states of the\r\nunion, Philadelphia or New York.\r\n\r\nThe air of New England has a keen edge of liberty, which suits few\r\nSouthern constitutions; and unkindly as abolition has found its native\r\nsoil and native skies, that is its birthplace, and there it flourishes, in\r\nspite of all attempts to root it out and trample it down, and within any\r\natmosphere poisoned by its influence no slaveholder can willingly draw\r\nbreath. Some travel in Europe, and few, whose means permit the contrary,\r\never pass the entire year on their plantations. Great intervals of many\r\nyears pass, and no master ever visits some of these properties: what\r\nspecies of attachment do you think the slave entertains for him? In other\r\ncases, the visits made will be of a few days in one of the winter months;\r\nthe estate and its cultivators remaining for the rest of the year under\r\nthe absolute control of the overseer, who, provided he contrives to get a\r\ngood crop of rice or cotton into the market for his employers, is left to\r\nthe arbitrary exercise of a will seldom uninfluenced for evil, by the\r\ncombined effects of the grossest ignorance and habitual intemperance. The\r\ntemptation to the latter vice is almost irresistible to a white man in\r\nsuch a climate, and leading an existence of brutal isolation, among a\r\nparcel of human beings as like brutes as they can be made. But the owner\r\nwho at these distant intervals of months or years revisits his estates, is\r\nlooked upon as a returning providence by the poor negroes. They have no\r\nexperience of his character to destroy their hopes in his goodness, and\r\nall possible and impossible ameliorations of their condition are\r\nanticipated from his advent, less work, more food, fewer stripes, and some\r\nof that consideration which the slave hopes may spring from his positive\r\nmoney value to his owner,--a fallacious dependence, as I have already\r\nattempted to show, but one which, if it has not always predominating\r\nweight with the master, never can have any with the overseer, who has not\r\neven the feeling of regard for his own property to mitigate his\r\nabsolutism over the slaves of another man.\r\n\r\nThere is a very powerful cause which makes the prosperity and well-being\r\n(as far as life is concerned) of most masters a subject of solicitude with\r\ntheir slaves. The only stability of their condition, such as it is, hangs\r\nupon it. If the owner of a plantation dies, his estates may fall into the\r\nmarket, and his slaves be sold at public auction the next day; and whether\r\nthis promises a better, or threatens a worse condition, the slaves cannot\r\nknow, and no human being cares. One thing it inevitably brings, the\r\nuprooting of all old associations; the disruption of all the ties of\r\nfellowship in misery; the tearing asunder of all relations of blood and\r\naffection; the sale into separate and far distant districts of fathers,\r\nmothers, husbands, wives, and children. If the estate does not lie in the\r\nextreme south, there is the vague dread of being driven thither from\r\nVirginia to Georgia, from Carolina to Alabama, or Louisiana, a change\r\nwhich, for reasons I have shown above, implies the passing from a higher\r\ninto a lower circle of the infernal pit of slavery.\r\n\r\nI once heard a slave on the plantation of an absentee express the most\r\nlively distress at hearing that his master was ill. Before, however, I had\r\nrecovered from my surprise at this warm 'attachment' to a distant and all\r\nbut unknown proprietor, the man added, 'massa die, what become of all him\r\npeople?'\r\n\r\nOn my arrival on the plantation where I resided, I was hailed with the\r\nmost extravagant demonstrations of delight, and all but lifted off my feet\r\nin the arms of people who had never seen me before; but who, knowing me to\r\nbe connected with their owners, expected from me some of the multitudinous\r\nbenefits which they always hope to derive from masters. These, until they\r\ncome to reside among them, are always believed to be sources of\r\nbeneficence and fountains of redress by the poor people, who have known no\r\nrule but the delegated tyranny of the overseer. In these expectations,\r\nhowever, they very soon find themselves cruelly mistaken. Of course, if\r\nthe absentee planter has received a satisfactory income from his estate,\r\nhe is inclined to be satisfied with the manager of it, and as\r\nsubordination to the only white man among hundreds of blacks must be\r\nmaintained at any and every cost, the overseer is justified and upheld in\r\nhis whole administration. If the wretched slave ever dared to prefer a\r\ncomplaint of ill-usage the most atrocious, the law which refuses the\r\ntestimony of a black against a white is not only the law of the land, but\r\nof every man's private dealings; and lying being one of the natural\r\nresults of slavery, and a tendency to shirk compelled and unrequited\r\nlabour another, the overseer stands on excellent vantage-ground, when he\r\nrefers to these undoubted characteristics of the system, if called upon to\r\nrebut any charge of cruelty or injustice. But pray consider for a moment\r\nthe probability of any such charge being preferred by a poor creature,\r\nwho has been for years left to the absolute disposal of this man, and who\r\nknows very well that in a few days, or months at furthest, the master will\r\nagain depart, leaving him again for months, perhaps for years, utterly at\r\nthe mercy of the man against whom he has dared to prefer a complaint. On\r\nthe estates which I visited, the owners had been habitually absent, and\r\nthe 'attachment' of slaves to such masters as these, you will allow, can\r\nhardly come under the denomination of a strong personal feeling.\r\n\r\nYour authority next states that the infirm and superannuated slaves no\r\nlonger capable of ministering to their masters' luxuries, on the estate\r\nthat he visited, were ending their lives among all the comforts of home,\r\nwith kindred and friends around them, in a condition which he contrasts,\r\nat least by implication, very favourably with the workhouse, the last\r\nrefuge provided by the social humanity of England--for the pauper labourer\r\nwhen he has reached that term when 'unregarded age is in corners thrown.'\r\nOn the plantation where I lived the infirmary was a large room, the walls\r\nof which were simply mud and lathes--the floor, the soil itself, damp with\r\nperpetual drippings from the holes in the roof, and the open space which\r\nserved for a window was protected only by a broken shutter, which, in\r\norder to exclude the cold, was drawn so near as almost to exclude the\r\nlight at the same time. Upon this earthen floor, with nothing but its\r\nhard damp surface beneath him, no covering but a tattered shirt and\r\ntrowsers, and a few sticks under his head for a pillow, lay an old man of\r\nupwards of seventy, dying. When I first looked at him I thought by the\r\nglazed stare of his eyes, and the flies that had gathered round his half\r\nopen mouth, that he was dead: but on stooping nearer, I perceived that the\r\nlast faint struggle of life was still going on, but even while I bent over\r\nhim it ceased; and so, like a worn-out hound, with no creature to comfort\r\nor relieve his last agony, with neither Christian solace or human succour\r\nnear him, with neither wife, nor child, nor even friendly fellow being to\r\nlift his head from the knotty sticks on which he had rested it, or drive\r\naway the insects that buzzed round his lips and nostrils like those of a\r\nfallen beast, died this poor old slave, whose life had been exhausted in\r\nunrequited labour, the fruits of which had gone to pamper the pride and\r\nfeed the luxury of those who knew and cared neither for his life or death,\r\nand to whom, if they had heard of the latter, it would have been a matter\r\nof absolute though small gain, the saving of a daily pittance of meal,\r\nwhich served to prolong a life no longer available to them.\r\n\r\nI proceed to the next item in your observer's record. All children below\r\nthe age of twelve were unemployed, he says, on the estate he visited: this\r\nis perhaps a questionable benefit, when, no process of mental cultivation\r\nbeing permitted, the only employment for the leisure thus allowed is that\r\nof rolling, like dogs or cats, in the sand and the sun. On all the\r\nplantations I visited, and on those where I resided, the infants in arms\r\nwere committed to the care of these juvenile slaves, who were denominated\r\nnurses, and whose sole employment was what they call to 'mind baby.' The\r\npoor little negro sucklings were cared for (I leave to your own judgement\r\nhow efficiently or how tenderly) by these half-savage slips of\r\nslavery--carried by them to the fields where their mothers were working\r\nunder the lash, to receive their needful nourishment, and then carried\r\nback again to the 'settlement,' or collection of negro huts, where they\r\nwallowed unheeded in utter filth and neglect until the time again returned\r\nfor their being carried to their mother's breast. Such was the employment\r\nof the children of eight or nine years old, and the only supervision\r\nexercised over either babies or 'baby minders' was that of the old woman\r\nleft in charge of the infirmary, where she made her abode all day long and\r\nbestowed such samples of her care and skill upon its inmates as I shall\r\nhave occasion to mention presently. The practice of thus driving the\r\nmothers a-field, even while their infants were still dependent upon them\r\nfor their daily nourishment, is one of which the evil as well as the\r\ncruelty is abundantly apparent without comment. The next note of\r\nadmiration elicited from your 'impartial observer' is bestowed upon the\r\nfact that the domestic servants (i.e. house slaves) on the plantation he\r\nvisited were _allowed_ to live away from the owner's residence, and to\r\nmarry. But I never was on a southern plantation, and I never heard of one,\r\nwhere any of the slaves were allowed to sleep under the same roof with\r\ntheir owner. With the exception of the women to whose care the children of\r\nthe planter, if he had any, might be confided, and perhaps a little boy or\r\ngirl slave, kept as a sort of pet animal and allowed to pass the night on\r\nthe floor of the sleeping apartment of some member of the family, the\r\nresidence of _any_ slaves belonging to a plantation night and day in their\r\nmaster's house, like Northern or European servants, is a thing I believe\r\nunknown throughout the Southern States. Of course I except the cities, and\r\nspeak only of the estates, where the house servants are neither better\r\nhoused or accommodated than the field-hands. Their intolerably dirty\r\nhabits and offensive persons would indeed render it a severe trial to any\r\nfamily accustomed to habits of decent cleanliness; and, moreover,\r\nconsiderations of safety, and that cautious vigilance which is a hard\r\nnecessity of the planter's existence, in spite of the supposed attachment\r\nof his slaves, would never permit the near proximity, during the\r\nunprotected hours of the night, of those whose intimacy with the daily\r\nhabits and knowledge of the nightly securities resorted to might prove\r\nterrible auxiliaries to any attack from without. The city guards, patrols,\r\nand night-watches, together with their stringent rules about negroes\r\nbeing abroad after night, and their well fortified lock-up houses for all\r\ndetected without a pass, afford some security against these attached\r\ndependents; but on remote plantations, where the owner and his family and\r\nperhaps a white overseer are alone, surrounded by slaves and separated\r\nfrom all succour against them, they do not sleep under the white man's\r\nroof, and, for politic reasons, pass the night away from their master's\r\nabode. The house servants have no other or better allowance of food than\r\nthe field labourers, but have the advantage of eking it out by what is\r\nleft from the master's table,--if possible, with even less comfort in one\r\nrespect, inasmuch as no time whatever is set apart for their meals, which\r\nthey snatch at any hour and in any way that they can--generally, however,\r\nstanding or squatting on their hams round the kitchen fire; the kitchen\r\nbeing a mere outhouse or barn with a fire in it. On the estate where I\r\nlived, as I have mentioned, they had no sleeping-rooms in the house; but\r\nwhen their work was over, they retired like the rest to their hovels, the\r\ndiscomfort of which had to them all the additional disadvantage of\r\ncomparison with their owner's mode of living. In all establishments\r\nwhatever, of course some disparity exists between the accommodation of the\r\ndrawing-rooms and best bed-rooms and the servants' kitchen and attics; but\r\non a plantation it is no longer a matter of degree. The young women who\r\nperformed the offices of waiting and housemaids, and the lads who\r\nattended upon the service of their master's table where I lived, had\r\nneither table to feed at nor chair to sit down upon themselves; the 'boys'\r\nlay all night on the hearth by the kitchen fire, and the women upon the\r\nusual slave's bed--a frame of rough boards, strewed with a little moss off\r\nthe trees, with the addition perhaps of a tattered and filthy blanket. As\r\nfor the so-called privilege of marrying--surely it is gross mockery to\r\napply such a word to a bond which may be holy in God's sight, but which\r\ndid not prevent the owner of a plantation where my observations were made\r\nfrom selling and buying men and their so-called wives and children into\r\ndivided bondage, nor the white overseer from compelling the wife of one of\r\nthe most excellent and exemplary of his master's slaves to live with\r\nhim--nor the white wife of another overseer, in her husband's temporary\r\nabsence from the estate, from barbarously flogging three _married_ slaves\r\nwithin a month of their confinement, their condition being the result of\r\nthe profligacy of the said overseer, and probably compelled by the very\r\nsame lash by which it was punished. This is a very disgusting picture of\r\nmarried life on slave estates: but I have undertaken to reply to the\r\nstatements of your informant, and I regret to be obliged to record the\r\nfacts by which alone I can do so. 'Work,' continues your authority, 'began\r\nat six in the morning, at nine an hour's rest was allowed for breakfast,\r\nand by two or three o'clock the day's work was done.' Certainly this was a\r\npattern plantation, and I can only lament that my experience lay amid such\r\nfar less favourable circumstances. The negroes among whom I lived went to\r\nthe fields at daybreak, carrying with them their allowance of food, which\r\ntoward noon, and not till then, they ate, cooking it over a fire which\r\nthey kindled as best they could where they were working; their _second_\r\nmeal in the day was at night after their labour was over, having worked at\r\nthe _very least_ six hours without rest or refreshment, since their\r\nnoon-day meal--properly so called, indeed, for it was meal and nothing\r\nelse, or a preparation something thicker than porridge, which they call\r\nhominy. Perhaps the candid observer, whose report of the estate he visited\r\nappeared to you so consolatory, would think that this diet contrasted\r\nfavourably with that of potato and butter-milk fed Irish labourers. But a\r\nmore just comparison surely would be with the mode of living of the\r\nlabouring population of the United States, the peasantry of Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts, or indeed with the condition of those\r\nvery potato and butter-milk fed Irishmen when they have exchanged their\r\nnative soil for the fields of the Northern and North-Western States, and\r\nwhen, as one of them once was heard to say, it was no use writing home\r\nthat he got meat three times a-day, for nobody in Ireland would believe\r\nit. The next item in the list of commendation is the hospital, which your\r\ninformant also visited, and of which he gives the following account--'It\r\nconsisted of three separate wards, all clean and well ventilated: one was\r\nfor lying-in women, who were invariably allowed a month's rest after their\r\nconfinement.' Permit me to place beside this picture that of a Southern\r\ninfirmary, such as I saw it, and taken on the spot. In the first room that\r\nI entered I found only half of the windows, of which there were six,\r\nglazed; these were almost as much obscured with dirt as the other\r\nwindowless ones were darkened by the dingy shutters which the shivering\r\ninmates had closed in order to protect themselves from the cold. In the\r\nenormous chimney glimmered the powerless embers of a few chips of wood,\r\nround which as many of the sick women as had strength to approach were\r\ncowering, some on wooden settles (there was not such a thing as a chair\r\nwith a back in the whole establishment), most of them on the ground,\r\nexcluding those who were too ill to rise--and these poor wretches lay\r\nprostrate on the earth, without bedstead, bed, mattress, or pillow, with\r\nno covering but the clothes they had on and some filthy rags of blanket in\r\nwhich they endeavoured to wrap themselves as they lay literally strewing\r\nthe floor, so that there was hardly room to pass between them. Here in\r\ntheir hour of sickness and suffering lay those whose health and strength\r\nhad given way under unrequited labour--some of them, no later than the\r\nprevious day, had been urged with the lash to their accustomed tasks--and\r\ntheir husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons were even at that hour\r\nsweating over the earth whose increase was to procure for others all the\r\nluxuries which health can enjoy, all the comforts which can alleviate\r\nsickness. Here lay women expecting every hour the terror and agonies of\r\nchild-birth, others who had just brought their doomed offspring into the\r\nworld, others who were groaning over the anguish and bitter disappointment\r\nof miscarriages--here lay some burning with fever, others chilled with\r\ncold and aching with rheumatism, upon the hard cold ground, the draughts\r\nand damp of the atmosphere increasing their sufferings, and dirt, noise,\r\nstench, and every aggravation of which sickness is capable combined in\r\ntheir condition. There had been among them one or two cases of prolonged\r\nand terribly hard labour; and the method adopted by the ignorant old\r\nnegress, who was the sole matron, midwife, nurse, physician, surgeon, and\r\nservant of the infirmary, to assist them in their extremity, was to tie a\r\ncloth tight round the throats of the agonised women, and by drawing it\r\ntill she almost suffocated them she produced violent and spasmodic\r\nstruggles, which she assured me she thought materially assisted the\r\nprogress of the labour. This was one of the Southern infirmaries with\r\nwhich I was acquainted; and I beg to conclude this chapter of contrasts to\r\nyour informant's consolatory views of slavery, by assuring you once more\r\nvery emphatically that they have been one and all drawn from estates\r\nwhere the slaves esteemed themselves well treated, were reputed generally\r\nto be so, and undoubtedly, as far as my observation went, were so,\r\ncompared with those on several of the adjoining plantations.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the statement respecting the sums of money earned by\r\nindustrious negroes, there is no doubt that it is perfectly correct. I\r\nknew of some slaves on a plantation in the extreme South who had received,\r\nat various times, large sums of money from a shopkeeper in the small town\r\nnear their estate, for the grey moss or lichen collected from the\r\nevergreen oaks of Carolina and Georgia, upon which it hangs in vast\r\nmasses, and after some cleaning process becomes an excellent substitute\r\nfor horse-hair, for bed, chair, and sofa-stuffing. On another estate, some\r\nof the slaves were expert boat makers, and had been allowed by their\r\nmasters to retain the price (no inconsiderable one) for some that they had\r\nfound time to manufacture after their day's labour was accomplished. These\r\nwere undoubtedly privileges, but I confess it appears to me that the\r\njuster view of the matter would be this--if these men were industrious\r\nenough out of their scanty leisure to earn these sums of money, which a\r\nmere exercise of arbitrary will on the part of the master allowed them to\r\nkeep, how much more of remuneration, of comfort, of improvement, physical\r\nand mental, might they not have achieved, had the due price of their daily\r\nlabour merely been paid to them? It seems to me that this is the mode of\r\nputting the case to Englishmen, and all who have not agreed to consider\r\nuncertain favour an equivalent for common justice in the dealings of man\r\nwith man. As the slaves are well known to toil for years sometimes to\r\namass the means of rescuing themselves from bondage, the fact of their\r\nbeing able and sometimes allowed to earn considerable sums of money is\r\nnotorious. But now that I have answered one by one the instances you have\r\nproduced, with others--I am sure as accurate and I believe as common--of\r\nan entirely opposite description, permit me to ask you what this sort of\r\ntestimony amounts to. I allow you full credit for yours, allow me full\r\ncredit for mine, and the result is very simply a nullification of the one\r\nby the other statement, and a proof that there is as much good as evil in\r\nthe details of slavery; but now, be pleased to throw into the scale this\r\nconsideration, that the principle of the whole is unmitigated abominable\r\nevil, as by your own acknowledgement you hold it to be, and add, moreover,\r\nthat the principle being invariably bad beyond the power of the best man\r\nacting under it to alter its execrable injustice, the goodness of the\r\ndetail is a matter absolutely dependent upon the will of each individual\r\nslaveholder, so that though the best cannot make the system in the\r\nsmallest particular better, the bad can make every practical detail of it\r\nas atrocious as the principle itself; and then tell me upon what ground\r\nyou palliate a monstrous iniquity, which is the rule, because of the\r\naccidental exceptions which go to prove it. Moreover, if, as you have\r\nasserted, good preponderates over evil in the practice, though not in the\r\ntheory of slavery, or it would not maintain its existence, why do you\r\nuphold to us, with so much complacency, the hope that it is surely if not\r\nrapidly approaching its abolishment? Why is the preponderating good, which\r\nhas, as you say, proved sufficient to uphold the institution hitherto, to\r\nbecome (in spite of the spread of civilisation and national progress, and\r\nthe gradual improvement of the slaves themselves) inadequate to its\r\nperpetuation henceforward? Or why, if good really has prevailed in it, do\r\nyou rejoice that it is speedily to pass away? You say the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves is inevitable, and that through progressive culture the negro\r\nof the Southern States daily approaches more nearly to the recovery of the\r\nrights of which he has been robbed. But whence do you draw this happy\r\naugury, except from the hope, which all Christian souls must cherish, that\r\nGod will not permit much longer so great a wickedness to darken the face\r\nof the earth? Surely the increased stringency of the Southern slave-laws,\r\nthe more than ever vigilant precautions against all attempts to enlighten\r\nor educate the negroes, the severer restrictions on manumission, the\r\nthrusting forth out of certain States of all free persons of colour, the\r\natrocious Fugitive Slave Bill, one of the latest achievements of\r\nCongress, and the piratical attempts upon Cuba, avowedly on the part of\r\nall Southerners, abetting or justifying it because it will add\r\nslave-territory and 600,000 slaves to their possessions;--surely these do\r\nnot seem indications of the better state of things you anticipate, except,\r\nindeed, as the straining of the chain beyond all endurable tightness\r\nsignificantly suggests the probability of its giving way.\r\n\r\nI do not believe the planters have any disposition to put an end to\r\nslavery, nor is it perhaps much to be wondered at that they have not. To\r\ndo so is, in the opinion of the majority of them, to run the risk of\r\nlosing their property, perhaps their lives, for a benefit which they\r\nprofess to think doubtful to the slaves themselves. How far they are right\r\nin anticipating ruin from the manumission of their slaves I think\r\nquestionable, but that they do so is certain, and self-impoverishment for\r\nthe sake of abstract principle is not a thing to be reasonably expected\r\nfrom any large mass of men. But, besides the natural fact that the\r\nslaveholders wish to retain their property, emancipation is, in their view\r\nof it, not only a risk of enormous pecuniary loss, and of their entire\r\nsocial status, but involves elements of personal danger, and above all,\r\ndisgust to inveterate prejudices, which they will assuredly never\r\nencounter. The question is not alone one of foregoing great wealth, or the\r\nmere means of subsistence (in either case almost equally hard); it is not\r\nalone the unbinding the hands of those who have many a bloody debt of\r\nhatred and revenge to settle; it is not alone the consenting suddenly to\r\nsee by their side, upon a footing of free social equality, creatures\r\ntowards whom their predominant feeling is one of mingled terror and\r\nabhorrence, and who, during the whole of their national existence, have\r\nbeen, as the earth, trampled beneath their feet, yet ever threatening to\r\ngape and swallow them alive. It is not all this alone which makes it\r\nunlikely that the Southern planter should desire to free his slaves:\r\nfreedom in America is not merely a personal right, it involves a political\r\nprivilege. Freemen there are legislators. The rulers of the land are the\r\nmajority of the people, and in many parts of the Southern States the black\r\nfree citizens would become, if not at once, yet in process of time,\r\ninevitably voters, landholders, delegates to state legislatures, members\r\nof assembly--who knows?--senators, judges, aspirants to the presidency of\r\nthe United States. You must be an American, or have lived long among them,\r\nto conceive the shout of derisive execration with which such an idea would\r\nbe hailed from one end of the land to the other.\r\n\r\nThat the emancipation of the negroes need not necessarily put them in\r\npossession of the franchise is of course obvious, but as a general\r\nconsequence the one would follow from the other; and at present certainly\r\nthe slaveholders are no more ready to grant the political privilege than\r\nthe natural right of freedom. Under these circumstances, though the utmost\r\ncommiseration is naturally excited by the slaves, I agree with you that\r\nsome forbearance is due to the masters. It is difficult to conceive a more\r\nawful position than theirs: fettered by laws which impede every movement\r\ntowards right and justice, and utterly without the desire to repeal\r\nthem--dogged by the apprehension of nameless retributions--bound beneath a\r\nburthen of responsibility for which, whether they acknowledge it or not,\r\nthey are held accountable by God and men--goaded by the keen consciousness\r\nof the growing reprobation of all civilised Christian communities, their\r\nexistence presents the miserable moral counterpart of the physical\r\ncondition of their slaves; and it is one compared with which that of the\r\nwretchedest slave is, in my judgement, worthy of envy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to C.G., Esq._\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon my answer to your questions, let me state that I have\r\nno claim to be ranked as an abolitionist in the American acceptation of\r\nthe word, for I have hitherto held the emancipation of the slaves to be\r\nexclusively the business and duty of their owners, whose highest moral\r\ninterest I thought it was to rid themselves of such a responsibility, in\r\nspite of the manifold worldly interests almost inextricably bound up with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis has been my feeling hitherto with regard to the views of the\r\nabolitionists, which I now, however, heartily embrace, inasmuch as I think\r\nthat from the moment the United States Government assumed an attitude of\r\ncoercion and supremacy towards the Southern States, it was bound with its\r\nfleets and armies to introduce its polity with respect to slavery, and\r\nwherever it planted the standard of the Union to proclaim the universal\r\nfreedom which is the recognised law of the Northern United States. That\r\nthey have not done so has been partly owing to a superstitious, but\r\nhonourable veneration for the letter of their great charter, the\r\nconstitution, and still more to the hope they have never ceased to\r\nentertain of bringing back the South to its allegiance under the former\r\nconditions of the Union, an event which will be rendered impossible by any\r\nattempt to interfere with the existence of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe North, with the exception of an inconsiderable minority of its\r\ninhabitants, has never been at all desirous of the emancipation of the\r\nslaves. The Democratic party which has ruled the United States for many\r\nyears past has always been friendly to the slaveholders, who have, with\r\nfew exceptions, been all members of it (for by a strange perversion both\r\nof words and ideas, some of the most Democratic States in the Union are\r\nSouthern slave States, and in the part of Georgia where the slave\r\npopulation is denser than in any other part of the South, a county exists\r\nbearing the satirical title of _Liberty County_). And the support of the\r\nSouth has been given to the Northern Democratic politicians, upon the\r\ndistinct understanding that their 'domestic institution' was to be\r\nguaranteed to them.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the free blacks in the Northern States has of course been\r\naffected most unfavourably by the slavery of their race throughout the\r\nother half of the Union, and indeed it would have been a difficult matter\r\nfor Northern citizens to maintain towards the blacks an attitude of social\r\nand political equality as far as the borders of Delaware, while\r\nimmediately beyond they were pledged to consider them as the 'chattels' of\r\ntheir owners, animals no more noble or human than the cattle in their\r\nmasters' fields.\r\n\r\nHow could peace have been maintained if the Southern slaveholders had been\r\ncompelled to endure the sight of negroes rising to wealth and eminence in\r\nthe Northern cities, or entering as fellow-members with themselves the\r\nhalls of that legislature to which all free-born citizens are eligible?\r\nthey would very certainly have declined with fierce scorn, not the\r\nfellowship of the blacks alone, but of those white men who admitted the\r\ndespised race of their serfs to a footing of such impartial equality. It\r\ntherefore was the instinctive, and became the deliberate policy of the\r\nNorthern people, once pledged to maintain slavery in the South, to make\r\ntheir task easy by degrading the blacks in the Northern States to a\r\ncondition contrasting as little as possible with that of the Southern\r\nslaves. The Northern politicians struck hands with the Southern\r\nslaveholders, and the great majority of the most enlightened citizens of\r\nthe Northern States, absorbed in the pursuit of wealth and the extension\r\nand consolidation of their admirable and wonderful national prosperity,\r\nabandoned the government of their noble country and the preservation of\r\nits nobler institutions to the slaveholding aristocracy of the South--to a\r\nmob of politicians by trade, the vilest and most venal class of men that\r\never disgraced and endangered a country--to foreign emigrants, whose\r\nbrutish ignorance did not prevent the Democratic party from seizing upon\r\nthem as voters, and bestowing on the Irish and German boors just landed on\r\ntheir shores the same political privileges as those possessed and\r\nintelligently exercised by the farmers and mechanics of New England, the\r\nmost enlightened men of their class to be found in the world.\r\n\r\nThe gradual encroachment of the Southern politicians upon the liberties of\r\nthe North, by their unrelaxing influence in Congress and over successive\r\ncabinets and presidents, was not without its effect in stimulating some\r\nresistance on the part of Northern statesmen of sufficient intelligence to\r\nperceive the inevitable results towards which this preponderance in the\r\nnational counsels was steadily tending; and I need not remind you of the\r\nrapidity and force with which General Jackson quelled an incipient\r\nrebellion in South Carolina, when Mr. Calhoun made the tariff question the\r\npretext for a threatened secession in 1832, of the life-long opposition to\r\nSouthern pretensions by John Quincy Adams, of the endeavour of Mr. Clay to\r\nstem the growing evil by the conditions of the Missouri compromise, and\r\nall the occasional attempts of individuals of more conscientious\r\nconvictions than their fellow-citizens on the subject of the sin of\r\nslavery, from Dr. Channing's eloquent protest on the annexation of Texas,\r\nto Mr. Charles Sumner's philippic against Mr. Brooks of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe disorganisation of the Democratic party, after a cohesion of so many\r\nyears, at length changed the aspect of affairs; and the North appeared to\r\nbe about to arouse itself from its apathetic consent to Southern\r\ndomination. The Republican party, headed by Colonel Fremont, who was known\r\nto be an anti-slavery man, nearly carried the presidential election six\r\nyears ago, and then every preparation had been made in the South for the\r\nprocess of secession, which was only averted by the election of Mr.\r\nBuchanan, a pro-slavery Southern sympathiser, though born in Pennsylvania.\r\nUnder his presidency, the Southern statesmen, resuming their attitude of\r\napparent friendliness with the North, kept in abeyance, maturing and\r\nperfecting by every treasonable practice, for which their preponderating\r\nshare in the cabinet afforded them fatal facilities, the plan of the\r\nviolent disruption of the Union, upon which they had determined whenever\r\nthe Republican party should have acquired sufficient strength, to elect a\r\npresident with Northern views. Before, however, this event occurred, the\r\nwar in Kansas rang a prophetic peal of warning through the land; and the\r\nstruggle there begun between New England emigrants bent on founding a free\r\nstate, and Missouri border ruffians determined to make the new territory a\r\nslaveholding addition to the South, might have roused the whole North and\r\nWest to the imminence of the peril, by which the safety of the Union was\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nBut neither the struggle in Kansas, nor the strange and piteous episode\r\nwhich grew out of it, of John Brown's attempt to excite an insurrection in\r\nVirginia, and his execution by the government of that State, did more than\r\nstartle the North with a nine days' wonder out of its apathetic\r\nindifference. The Republican party, it is true, gained adherents, and\r\nacquired strength by degrees; and Mr. Buchanan's term of office\r\napproaching its expiration, it became apparent that the Democratic party\r\nwas about to lose its supremacy, and the slaveholders their dominion; and\r\nno sooner was this evident than the latter threw off the mask, and\r\nrenounced their allegiance to the Union. In a day--in an hour\r\nalmost--those stood face to face as mortal enemies who were citizens of\r\nthe same country, subjects of the same government, children of the same\r\nsoil; and the North, incredulous and amazed, found itself suddenly\r\nsummoned to retrieve its lost power and influence, and assert the dignity\r\nof the insulted Union against the rebellious attempt of the South to\r\noverthrow it.\r\n\r\nBut it was late for them to take that task in hand. For years the conduct\r\nof the government of the United States had been becoming a more desperate\r\nand degraded _jobbery_, one from which day by day the Northern gentlemen\r\nof intelligence, influence, and education withdrew themselves in greater\r\ndisgust, devoting their energies to schemes of mere personal advantage,\r\nand leaving the commonweal with selfish and contemptuous indifference to\r\nthe guidance of any hands less nice and less busy than their own.\r\n\r\nNor would the Southern planters--a prouder and more aristocratic race than\r\nthe Northern merchants--have relished the companionship of their\r\nfellow-politicians more than the latter, but _their_ personal interests\r\nwere at stake, and immediately concerned in their maintaining their\r\npredominant influence over the government; and while the Boston men wrote\r\nand talked transcendentalism, and became the most accomplished of\r\n_aestetische_ cotton spinners and railroad speculators, and made the shoes\r\nand cow-hides of the Southerners, the latter made their laws; (I believe\r\nNew Jersey is really the great cow-hide factory); and the New York men,\r\nowners of the fastest horses and finest houses in the land, having made a\r\nsort of Brummagem Paris of their city, were the bankers and brokers of the\r\nSoutherners, while the latter were their legislators.\r\n\r\nThe grip the slaveholders had fastened on the helm of the State had been\r\ntightening for nearly half a century, till the government of the nation\r\nhad become literally theirs, and the idea of their relinquishing it was\r\none which the North did not contemplate, and they would not tolerate.\r\n\r\nIf I have said nothing of the grievances which the South has alleged\r\nagainst the North--its tariff, made chiefly in the interest of the\r\nnorth-eastern manufacturing States, or its inconsiderable but enthusiastic\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania Abolition party--it is because I do not\r\nbelieve these causes of complaint would have had the same effect upon any\r\nbut a community of slaveholders, men made impatient (by the life-long\r\nhabit of despotism), not only of all control, but of any opposition.\r\nThirty years ago Andrew Jackson--a man of keen sagacity as well as\r\ndetermined energy--wrote of them that they were bent upon destroying the\r\nUnion, and that, whatever was the pretext of their discontent, that was\r\ntheir aim and purpose. 'To-day,' he wrote, 'it is the tariff, by and by it\r\nwill be slavery.' The event has proved how true a prophet he was. My own\r\nconviction is that the national character produced and fostered by\r\nslaveholding is incompatible with free institutions, and that the\r\nSouthern aristocracy, thanks to the pernicious influences by which they\r\nare surrounded, are unfit to be members of a Christian republic. It is\r\nslavery that has made the Southerners rebels to their government, traitors\r\nto their country, and the originators of the bloodiest civil war that ever\r\ndisgraced humanity and civilisation. It is for their sinful complicity in\r\nslavery, and their shameful abandonment of all their duties as citizens,\r\nthat the Northerners are paying in the blood of their men, the tears of\r\ntheir women, and the treasure which they have till now held more precious\r\nthan their birthright. They must now not merely impose a wise restriction\r\nupon slavery, they must be prepared to extinguish it. They neglected and\r\ndespised the task of moderating its conditions and checking its growth;\r\nthey must now suddenly, in the midst of unparalleled difficulties and\r\ndangers, be ready to deal summarily with its entire existence. They have\r\nloved the pursuit of personal prosperity and pleasure more than their\r\ncountry; and now they must spend life and living to reconquer their great\r\ninheritance, and win back at the sword's point what Heaven had forbidden\r\nthem to lose. Nor are we, here in England, without part in this tremendous\r\nsin and sorrow; we have persisted in feeding our looms, and the huge\r\nwealth they coin, with the produce of slavery. In vain our vast Indian\r\nterritory has solicited the advantage of becoming our free cotton\r\nplantation; neither our manufacturers nor our government would venture,\r\nwould wait, would spend or lose, for that purpose; the slave-grown harvest\r\nwas ready, was abundant, was cheap--and now the thousand arms of our great\r\nnational industry are folded in deplorable inactivity; the countless hands\r\nthat wrought from morn till night the wealth that was a world's wonder are\r\nstretched unwillingly to beg their bread; and England has never seen a\r\nsadder sight than the enforced idleness of her poor operatives, or a\r\nnobler one than their patient and heroic endurance.\r\n\r\nAnd now you ask me what plan, what scheme, what project the government of\r\nthe United States has formed for the safe and successful emancipation of\r\nfour millions of slaves, in the midst of a country distracted with all the\r\nhorrors of war, and the male population of which is engaged in military\r\nservice at a distance from their homes? Most assuredly none. Precipitated\r\nheadlong from a state of apparent profound security and prosperity into a\r\nseries of calamitous events which have brought the country to the verge of\r\nruin, neither the nation or its governors have had leisure to prepare\r\nthemselves for any of the disastrous circumstances they have had to\r\nencounter, least of all for the momentous change which the President's\r\nproclamation announces as imminent: a measure of supreme importance, not\r\ndeliberately adopted as the result of philanthropic conviction or\r\nfar-sighted policy, but (if not a mere feint of party politics) the last\r\neffort of the incensed spirit of endurance in the North--a punishment\r\nthreatened against rebels, whom they cannot otherwise subdue, and which a\r\nyear ago half the Northern population would have condemned upon principle,\r\nand more than half revolted from on instinct.\r\n\r\nThe country being in a state of war necessarily complicates everything,\r\nand renders the most plausible suggestions for the settlement of the\r\nquestion of emancipation futile: because from first to last now it will be\r\none tremendous chapter of accidents, instead of a carefully considered and\r\nwisely prepared measure of government. But supposing the war to have\r\nceased, either by the success of the Northern arms or by the consent of\r\nboth belligerents, the question of manumission in the Southern States when\r\nreduced to the condition of territories or restored to the sway of their\r\nown elected governors and legislatures, though difficult, is by no means\r\none of insuperable difficulty; and I do not believe that a great nation of\r\nEnglishmen, having once the will to rid itself of a danger and a disgrace,\r\nwill fail to find a way. The thing, therefore, most to be desired now is,\r\nthat Americans may unanimously embrace the purpose of emancipation, and,\r\nthough they have been reluctantly driven by the irresistible force of\r\ncircumstances to contemplate the measure, may henceforward never avert\r\ntheir eyes from it till it is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the South many years ago I conversed frequently with two\r\nhighly intelligent men, both of whom agreed in saying that the immense\r\nvalue of the slaves as property was the only real obstacle to their\r\nmanumission, and that whenever the Southerners became convinced that it\r\nwas their interest to free them they would very soon find the means to do\r\nit. In some respects the conditions are more favourable than those we had\r\nto encounter in freeing our West India slaves. Though the soil and climate\r\nof the Southern States are fertile and favourable, they are not tropical,\r\nand there is no profuse natural growth of fruits or vegetables to render\r\nsubsistence possible without labour; the winter temperature is like that\r\nof the Roman States; and even as far south as Georgia and the borders of\r\nFlorida, frosts severe enough to kill the orange trees are sometimes\r\nexperienced. The inhabitants of the Southern States, throughout by far the\r\nlargest portion of their extent, must labour to live, and will undoubtedly\r\nobey the beneficent law of necessity whenever they are made to feel that\r\ntheir existence depends upon their own exertions. The plan of a gradual\r\nemancipation, preceded by a limited apprenticeship of the negroes to white\r\nmasters, is of course often suggested as less dangerous than their entire\r\nand immediate enfranchisement. But when years ago I lived on a Southern\r\nplantation, and had opportunities of observing the miserable results of\r\nthe system on everything connected with it--the souls, minds, bodies, and\r\nestates of both races of men, and the very soil on which they existed\r\ntogether--I came to the conclusion that immediate and entire emancipation\r\nwas not only an act of imperative right, but would be the safest and most\r\nprofitable course for the interests of both parties. The gradual and\r\ninevitable process of ruin which exhibits itself in the long run on every\r\nproperty involving slavery, naturally suggests some element of decay\r\ninherent in the system; the reckless habits of extravagance and\r\nprodigality in the masters, the ruinous wastefulness and ignorant\r\nincapacity of the slaves, the deterioration of the land under the\r\nexhausting and thriftless cultivation to which it is subjected, made it\r\nevident to me that there were but two means of maintaining a prosperous\r\nownership in Southern plantations: either the possession of considerable\r\ncapital wherewith to recruit the gradual waste of the energies of the\r\nsoil, and supply by all the improved and costly methods of modern\r\nagriculture the means of profitable cultivation (a process demanding, as\r\nEnglish farmers know, an enormous and incessant outlay of both money and\r\nskill), or an unlimited command of fresh soil, to which the slaves might\r\nbe transferred as soon as that already under culture exhibited signs of\r\nexhaustion. Now the Southerners are for the most part men whose only\r\nwealth is in their land and labourers--a large force of slaves is their\r\nmost profitable investment. The great capitalists and monied men of the\r\ncountry are Northern men; the planters are men of large estates but\r\nrestricted means--many of them are deeply involved in debt, and there are\r\nvery few who do not depend from year to year for their subsistence on the\r\nharvest of their fields and the chances of the cotton and rice crops of\r\neach season.\r\n\r\nThis makes it of vital importance to them to command an unrestricted\r\nextent of territory. The man who can move a 'gang' of able-bodied negroes\r\nto a tract of virgin soil is sure of an immense return of wealth; as sure\r\nas that he who is circumscribed in this respect, and limited to the\r\ncultivation of certain lands with cotton or tobacco by slaves, will in the\r\ncourse of a few years see his estate gradually exhausted and unproductive,\r\nrefusing its increase, while its black population propagating and\r\nmultiplying will compel him eventually, under penalty of starvation, to\r\nmake _them_ his crop, and substitute, as the Virginians have been\r\nconstrained to do, a traffic in human cattle for the cultivation of\r\nvegetable harvests.\r\n\r\nThe steady decrease of the value of the cotton crop, even on the famous\r\nsea island plantations of Georgia, often suggested to me the inevitable\r\nruin of the owners within a certain calculable space of time, as the land\r\nbecame worn out, and the negroes continued to increase in number; and had\r\nthe estate on which I lived been mine, and the laws of Georgia not made\r\nsuch an experiment impossible, I would have emancipated the slaves on it\r\nimmediately, and turned them into a free tenantry, as the first means of\r\nsaving my property from impending destruction. I would have paid them\r\nwages, and they should have paid me rent. I would have relinquished the\r\ncharge of feeding and clothing them, and the burthen of their old, young,\r\nand infirm; in short, I would have put them at once upon the footing of\r\nfree hired labourers. Of course such a process would have involved\r\ntemporary loss, and for a year or two the income of the estate would, I\r\ndare say, have suffered considerably; but, in all such diversions of\r\nlabour or capital from old into new channels and modes of operation, there\r\nmust be an immediate sacrifice of present to future profit, and I do not\r\ndoubt that the estate would have recovered from the momentary necessary\r\ninterruption of its productiveness, to resume it with an upward instead of\r\na downward tendency, and a vigorous impulse towards progress and\r\nimprovement substituted for the present slow but sure drifting to\r\nstagnation and decay.\r\n\r\nAs I have told you, the land affords no spontaneous produce which will\r\nsustain life without labour. The negroes therefore must work to eat; they\r\nare used to the soil and climate, and accustomed to the agriculture, and\r\nthere is no reason at all to apprehend--as has been suggested--that a race\r\nof people singularly attached to the place of their birth and residence\r\nwould abandon in any large numbers their own country, just as the\r\nconditions of their existence in it were made more favourable, to try the\r\nunknown and (to absolute ignorance) forbidding risks of emigration to the\r\nsterner climate and harder soil of the Northern States.\r\n\r\nOf course, in freeing the slaves, it would be necessary to contemplate the\r\npossibility of their becoming eventual proprietors of the soil to some\r\nextent themselves. There is as little doubt that many of them would soon\r\nacquire the means of doing so (men who amass, during hours of daily extra\r\nlabour, through years of unpaid toil, the means of buying themselves from\r\ntheir masters, would soon justify their freedom by the intelligent\r\nimprovement of their condition), as that many of the present landholders\r\nwould be ready and glad to alienate their impoverished estates by parcels,\r\nand sell the land which has become comparatively unprofitable to them, to\r\nits enfranchised cultivators. This, the future ownership of land by\r\nnegroes, as well as their admission to those rights of citizenship which\r\neverywhere in America such ownership involves, would necessarily be future\r\nsubjects of legislation; and either or both privileges might be withheld\r\ntemporarily, indefinitely, or permanently, as might seem expedient, and\r\nthe progress in civilisation which might justify such an extension of\r\nrights. These, and any other modifications of the state of the black\r\npopulation in the South, would require great wisdom to deal with, but\r\ntheir immediate transformation from bondsmen to free might, I think, be\r\naccomplished with little danger or difficulty, and with certain increase\r\nof prosperity to the Southern States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not impossible that, left to the unimpeded action\r\nof the natural laws that govern the existence of various races, the black\r\npopulation, no longer directly preserved and propagated for the purposes\r\nof slavery, might gradually decrease and dwindle, as it does at the\r\nNorth--where, besides the unfavourable influence of a cold climate on a\r\nrace originally African, it suffers from its admixture with the whites,\r\nand the amalgamation of the two races, as far as it goes, tends evidently\r\nto the destruction of the weaker. The Northern mulattoes are an unhealthy\r\nfeeble population, and it might yet appear that even under the more\r\nfavourable influence of a Southern climate, whenever the direct stimulus\r\nafforded by slavery to the increase of the negroes was removed, their\r\ngradual extinction or absorption by the predominant white race would\r\nfollow in the course of time.\r\n\r\nBut the daily course of events appears to be rendering more and more\r\nunlikely the immediate effectual enfranchisement of the slaves: the\r\nPresident's proclamation will reach with but little efficacy beyond the\r\nmere borders of the Southern States. The war is assuming an aspect of\r\nindefinite duration; and it is difficult to conceive what will be the\r\ncondition of the blacks, freed _de jure_ but by no means _de facto_, in\r\nthe vast interior regions of the Southern States, as long as the struggle\r\nraging all round their confines does not penetrate within them. Each of\r\nthe combatants is far too busily absorbed in the furious strife to afford\r\nthought, leisure, or means, either effectually to free the slaves or\r\neffectually to replace them in bondage; and in the meantime their\r\ncondition is the worst possible for the future success of either\r\noperation. If the North succeeds in subjugating the South, its earliest\r\nbusiness will be to make the freedom of the slaves real as well as\r\nnominal, and as little injurious to themselves as possible. If, on the\r\nother hand, the South makes good its pretensions to a separate national\r\nexistence, no sooner will the disseverment of the Union be an established\r\nfact than the slaveholders will have to consolidate once more the system\r\nof their 'peculiar institution,' to reconstruct the prison which has half\r\ncrumbled to the ground, and rivet afresh the chains which have been all\r\nbut struck off. This will be difficult: the determination of the North to\r\nrestrict the area of slavery by forbidding its ingress into future\r\nterritories and States has been considered by the slaveholders a wrong,\r\nand a danger justifying a bloody civil war; inasmuch as, if under those\r\ncircumstances they did not abolish slavery themselves in a given number of\r\nyears, it would infallibly abolish them by the increase of the negro\r\npopulation, hemmed with them into a restricted space by this _cordon\r\nsanitaire_ drawn round them. But, bad as this prospect has seemed to\r\nslaveholders (determined to continue such), and justifying--as it may be\r\nconceded that it does from their point of view--not a ferocious civil war,\r\nbut a peaceable separation from States whose interests were declared\r\nabsolutely irreconcileable with theirs, the position in which they will\r\nfind themselves if the contest terminates in favour of Secession will be\r\nundoubtedly more difficult and terrible than the one the mere anticipation\r\nof which has driven them to the dire resort of civil war. All round the\r\nSouthern coast, and all along the course of the great Mississippi, and all\r\nacross the northern frontier of the Slave States, the negroes have already\r\nthrown off the trammels of slavery. Whatever their condition may be--and\r\ndoubtless in many respects it is miserable enough--they are to all intents\r\nand purposes free. Vast numbers of them have joined the Northern invading\r\narmies, and considerable bodies of them have become organised as soldiers\r\nand labourers, under the supervision of Northern officers and employers;\r\nmost of them have learned the use of arms, and possess them; all of them\r\nhave exchanged the insufficient slave diet of grits and rice for the\r\nabundant supplies of animal food, which the poorest labourer in that\r\nfavoured land of cheap provisions and high wages indulges in to an extent\r\nunknown in any other country. None of these slaves of yesterday will be\r\nthe same slaves to-morrow. Little essential difference as may yet have\r\nbeen effected by the President's proclamation in the interior of the\r\nSouth in the condition of the blacks, it is undoubtedly known to them, and\r\nthey are waiting in ominous suspense its accomplishment or defeat by the\r\nfortune of the war; they are watching the issue of the contest of which\r\nthey well know themselves to be the theme, and at its conclusion, end how\r\nit will, they must be emancipated or exterminated. With the North not only\r\nnot friendly to slavery, but henceforward bitterly hostile to\r\nslaveholders, and no more to be reckoned upon as heretofore, it might have\r\nbeen infallibly by the Southern white population in any difficulty with\r\nthe blacks (a fact of which the negroes will be as well aware as their\r\nformer masters)--with an invisible boundary stretching from ocean to\r\nocean, over which they may fly without fear of a master's claim following\r\nthem a single inch--with the hope and expectation of liberty suddenly\r\nsnatched from them at the moment it seemed within their grasp--with the\r\ndoor of their dungeon once more barred between them and the light into\r\nwhich they were in the act of emerging--is it to be conceived, that these\r\nfour millions of people, many thousands of whom are already free and\r\narmed, will submit without a struggle to be again thrust down into the\r\nhell of slavery? Hitherto there has been no insurrection among the\r\nnegroes, and observers friendly and inimical to them have alike drawn from\r\nthat fact conclusions unfavourable to their appreciation of the freedom\r\napparently within their grasp; but they are waiting to see what the North\r\nwill really achieve for them. The liberty offered them is hitherto\r\nanomalous, and uncertain enough in its conditions; they probably trust it\r\nas little as they know it: but slavery they _do_ know--and when once they\r\nfind themselves again delivered over to _that_ experience, there will not\r\nbe ONE insurrection in the South; there will be an insurrection in every\r\nState, in every county, on every plantation--a struggle as fierce as it\r\nwill be futile--a hopeless effort of hopeless men, which will baptise in\r\nblood the new American nation, and inaugurate its birth among the\r\ncivilised societies of the earth, not by the manumission but the massacre\r\nof every slave within its borders.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, Mr. Jefferson Davis means to free the negroes. Whenever\r\nthat consummation is attained, the root of bitterness will have perished\r\nfrom the land; and when a few years shall have passed blunting the hatred\r\nwhich has been excited by this fratricidal strife, the Americans of both\r\nthe Northern and Southern States will perceive that the selfish policy of\r\nother nations would not have so rejoiced over their division, had it not\r\nseemed, to those who loved them not, the proof of past failure and the\r\nprophecy of future weakness.\r\n\r\nAdmonished by its terrible experiences, I believe the nation will reunite\r\nitself under one government, remodel its constitution, and again address\r\nitself to fulfill its glorious destiny. I believe that the country sprung\r\nfrom ours--of all our just subjects of national pride the greatest--will\r\nresume its career of prosperity and power, and become the noblest as well\r\nas the mightiest that has existed among the nations of the earth.",
